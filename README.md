# climate-paper-classifier

## Abstract
We seek to develop a classification model that predicts the subject category of research papers related to climate, energy, and environment. We compare five different models and find that our Bidirectional Encoder Representation from Transformers (BERT) proves to be the most powerful model for classifying climate paper abstracts into relevant categories, providing accurate and reliable results. Our models ranged in complexity, but we found that this didn’t always correlate with performance; logistic regression was our simplest model and we found that it performed almost as well as our BERT model whereas CNN was one of our most complex architectures and it performed the worst for our data. With that being said, all five models ultimately achieve comparable prediction accuracy ranging from 75% to 82% across the five subject categories. Our findings highlight several things, but most prevalent is the importance of acquiring a large amount of data to help improve performance, or if not possible, using transfer learning where it’s useful. In future work, we would like to expand our categories in order to make it more useful as a widely generalizable classification tool.
