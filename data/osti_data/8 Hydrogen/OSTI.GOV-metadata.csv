"Market Segmentation Analysis of Medium and Heavy Duty Trucks with a Fuel Cell Emphasis","Hunter, Chad (ORCID:0000000323148115); Penev, Michael (ORCID:0000000283021565); Reznicek, Evan (ORCID:0000000274561199)","ENERGY STORAGE; advanced powertrains; battery; class 8; FASTSim; fuel cell; heavy duty; hybrid; hydrogen; medium duty; SERA; sleeper cab; total cost of ownership; truck","The medium- and heavy-duty transportation sector is experiencing rapid changes in powertrain technology innovation with recent announcements of battery electric and fuel cell electric trucks being offered. However, the economics of these alternative powertrain vehicles are uncertain and difficult to compare directly. This analysis seeks to bridge the gap of techno-economic analyses for these alternative powertrain vehicles by comparing all of them within the same analytic framework. Specifically, this report evaluates the total cost of ownership (TCO) of six different truck powertrain technologies (diesel, diesel hybrid-electric, plug-in hybrid electric, compressed natural gas, battery electric, and fuel cell electric) for three different truck vocations (Class 8 long haul [750 mile range], Class 8 short haul [300 mile range], and Class 4 parcel delivery), for different Department of Energy technology statuses (2018, 2025, and Ultimate). The TCO framework includes direct costs (purchase price, fuel, operating and maintenance), indirect costs (dwell time costs due to refueling/recharging and payload opportunity costs from forgone revenue due to the truck being weight-limited), but excludes general operation costs (driver wages and benefits, insurance, tire replacements, permits, tolls) that are assumed to be the same across powertrains. The TCO was evaluated for four scenarios that reflect typical business operating conditions. The TCO analysis results highlight that each powertrain technology may have an economic advantage on a TCO basis in certain business operating conditions and depending on fuel price realized. For Class 8 long haul trucks when payload opportunity costs are not incurred, battery electric and fuel cell electric powertrains could be cost competitive with diesel if the 2025 targets are achieved and fuel prices are low. If payload opportunity costs are incurred, battery electric powertrains are not estimated to reach TCO parity with diesel even if Ultimate targets and low electricity prices are realized, indicating a need for significant vehicle lightweighting. In Class 8 short haul commercial applications when payload opportunity costs are not incurred, battery electric, fuel cell electric, and compressed natural gas vehicle powertrains have very competitive TCOs with diesel if the 2025 targets are achieved. In Class 8 short haul commercial applications when payload opportunity costs are incurred, the battery electric vehicle powertrains can achieve TCO parity with diesel only if the Ultimate battery prices are met ($80/kWh). In Class 4 parcel delivery truck operating scenarios where there are no dwell time costs incurred, the plug-in hybrid electric vehicle, battery electric vehicle, and fuel cell electric vehicle could be cost-competitive with diesel and compressed natural gas with current (2018) technology performance and costs. In general, the payload opportunity costs can be a significant driver to TCO for the Class 8 long and short haul commercial vehicle applications while the dwell time costs could be a major TCO cost driver for the Class 4 parcel delivery vehicle if the business scenario realizes those costs.","","","National Renewable Energy Lab.

Neutron and proton removal reactions have been used in the past twenty years to probe the single-particle structure of exotic nuclei. The core parallel-momentum distribution can give information on the angular momentum and spin of the nucleon initial state while the total removal cross section is sensitive to the asymptotic part of the initial wave function and also to the reaction mechanism. Because knockout is a peripheral reaction from which the Asymptotic Normalization Constant (ANC) of the single-particle wave function can be extracted, it has been used as an indirect method to obtain the rate of reactions like {sup 8}B(p,γ){sup 9}C or {sup 7}Be(p,γ){sup 8}B. Nucleon removal has recently been applied by the HiRA collaboration [3] to situations in which the remaining “core” is beyond the drip line, such as {sup 8}C and {sup 6}Be, unbound by one or more protons, and whose excitation-energy spectrum can be obtained by the invariant-mass method. By gating on the ground-state peak, “core” parallel-momentum distributions and total knockout cross sections have been obtained similar to previous studies with well-bound “cores”. In addition for each projectile, knock out to final bound states has also been obtained in several cases. We will report on the theoretical description and comparison to this experimental data for a few cases for which advances in the accuracy of the transfer-to-the continuum model [4, 5] have been made [6]. These include the use, when available, of “ab-initio” overlaps for the initial state [7] and in particular their ANC values [8]. Also, the construction of a nucleus-target folding potential for the treatment of the core-target S-matrix [9] using for the cores “ab-initio” densities [10] and state-of-the-art n−{sup 9}Be optical potentials [11]. Preliminary results and open problems will be discussed.","","","","","","United States","2015-02-24T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","Conference","Journal Name: AIP Conference Proceedings; Journal Volume: 1645; Journal Issue: 1; Conference: Carpathian Summer School of Physics 2014, Sinaia (Romania), 13-26 Jul 2014; Other Information: (c) 2015 AIP Publishing LLC; Country of input: International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA)","","Medium: X; Size: page(s) 30-38","","","","Journal ID: ISSN 0094-243X; CODEN: APCPCS; TRN: US15A2485096684","10.1063/1.4909557","","2015-10-26T00:00:00Z","22390988","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/22390988","","AIP Conference Proceedings","1","1645"

This work compares the depth dose distribution and corresponding dose averaged linear energy transfer (LET) distribution, which is related to the biological effectiveness, for different ion beams ({sup 1}H, {sup 4}He, {sup 6}Li, {sup 8}Be, {sup 10}B, {sup 12}C, {sup 14}N, and {sup 16}O) using multi-energetic spectra in order to configure spread-out Bragg peaks (SOBP). Methods: Monte Carlo simulations were performed in order to configure a 5 cm SOBP at 8 cm depth in water for all the different ion beams. Physical dose and dose averaged LET distributions as a function of depth were then calculated and compared. The superposition of dose distribution of all ions is also presented for a two opposing fields configuration. Additional simulations were performed for {sup 12}C beams to investigate the dependence of dose and dose averaged LET distributions on target depth and size, as well as beam configuration. These included simulations for a 3 cm SOBP at 7, 10, and 13 cm depth in water, a 6 cm SOBP at 7 depth in water, and two opposing fields of 6 cm SOBP. Results: Alpha particles and protons present superior physical depth dose distributions relative to the rest of the beams studied. Dose averaged LET distributions results suggest higher biological effectiveness in the target volume for carbon, nitrogen and oxygen ions. This is coupled, however, with relatively high LET values--especially for the last two ion species--outside the SOBP where healthy tissue would be located. Dose averaged LET distributions for {sup 8}Be and {sup 10}B beams show that they could be attractive alternatives to {sup 12}C for the treatment of small, not deeply seated lesions. The potential therapeutic effect of different ion beams studied in this work depends on target volume and position, as well as the number of beams used. Conclusions: The optimization of beam modality for specific tumor cites remains an open question that warrants further investigation and clinically relevant results.","","","","","","United States","2011-12-15T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: Medical Physics; Journal Volume: 38; Journal Issue: 12; Other Information: (c) 2011 American Association of Physicists in Medicine; Country of input: International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA)","","Medium: X; Size: page(s) 6585-6591","","","","Journal ID: ISSN 0094-2405; CODEN: MPHYA6; TRN: US12A6724056514","10.1118/1.3662911","","2013-07-08T00:00:00Z","22098696","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/22098696","","Medical Physics","12","38"

The instability was caused by two factors--thermal deformation of fine stepper stages in the monochromator, which resulted in reduction in beam intensity with time, and vibrations of coolant supply units and vacuum pumps, which resulted in fluctuation in beam intensity. We remodeled the crystal holders to maintain the stage temperatures constant with water, attached x-ray and electron shields to the stages in order to prevent their warming up, introduced accumulators in the water circuits to absorb pressure pulsation, used polyurethane tubes to stabilize water flow, and placed rubber cushions under scroll vacuum pumps. As a result, the intensity reduction rate of the beam decreased from 26% to 1% per hour and the intensity fluctuation from 13% to 1%. The monochromators were also modified to prevent radiation damage to the crystals, materials used as a water seal, and motor cables.","","","","","","United States","2010-06-23T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: AIP Conference Proceedings; Journal Volume: 1234; Journal Issue: 1; Conference: SRI 2009: 10. international conference on radiation instrumentation, Melbourne (Australia), 27 Sep - 2 Oct 2009; Other Information: DOI: 10.1063/1.3463329; (c) 2010 American Institute of Physics","","Medium: X; Size: page(s) 785-788","","","","Journal ID: ISSN 0094-243X; APCPCS; TRN: US10B6712003498","10.1063/1.3463329","","2011-04-07T00:00:00Z","21410337","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/21410337","","AIP Conference Proceedings","1","1234"

The effective electron kinetic energy threshold used is T{sub eff}=3.5 MeV, the lowest analysis threshold yet achieved with water Cherenkov detector data. In units of 10{sup 6} cm{sup -2} s{sup -1}, the total flux of active-flavor neutrinos from {sup 8}B decay in the Sun measured using the neutral current (NC) reaction of neutrinos on deuterons, with no constraint on the {sup 8}B neutrino energy spectrum, is found to be PHI{sub NC}=5.140{sub -0.158}{sup +0.160}(stat){sub -0.117}{sup +0.132}(syst). These uncertainties are more than a factor of 2 smaller than previously published results. Also presented are the spectra of recoil electrons from the charged current reaction of neutrinos on deuterons and the elastic scattering of electrons. A fit to the Sudbury Neutrino Observatory data in which the free parameters directly describe the total {sup 8}B neutrino flux and the energy-dependent nu{sub e} survival probability provides a measure of the total {sup 8}B neutrino flux PHI{sub {sup 8}{sub B}}=5.046{sub -0.152}{sup +0.159}(stat){sub -0.123}{sup +0.107}(syst).

The global value of PHI{sup 8}{sub B} is extracted to a precision of {sub -2.95}{sup +2.38}%. In a three-flavor analysis the best fit value of sin{sup 2}theta{sub 13} is 2.00{sub -1.63}{sup +2.09}x10{sup -2}.

The role of the spin-orbit (SO) potential and effects of the energy and density dependence of the effective NN forces are studied. Comparison of the calculations with the available experimental data on the elastic scattering differential cross sections at beam energies &lt;100 MeV/N is performed and conclusions on the role of the aforesaid effects are made.

This study represents the first unambiguous proof of the existence of the 7H state.","","","","","","United States","2007-05-22T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: AIP Conference Proceedings; Journal Volume: 912; Journal Issue: 1; Conference: International symposium on exotic nuclei, Khanty-Mansiysk (Russian Federation), 17-22 Jul 2006; Other Information: DOI: 10.1063/1.2746577; (c) 2007 American Institute of Physics; Country of input: International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA)","","Medium: X; Size: page(s) 23-31","","","","Journal ID: ISSN 0094-243X; APCPCS; TRN: US07B4107076618","10.1063/1.2746577","","2010-06-03T00:00:00Z","21061806","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/21061806","","AIP Conference Proceedings","1","912"

The spectrum of 9He was studied by means of the 2H(8He,p)9He reaction. Energy and angular correlations were obtained for the 9He decay products by complete kinematical reconstruction. The lowest resonant state of 9He is found at about 2 MeV with a width of {approx}2 MeV and is identified as 1/2-. The observed angular correlation pattern is uniquely explained by the interference of the 1/2- resonance with a virtual state 1/2+ (a limit of a0 &gt; -20 fm on the scattering length is obtained), and with a 5/2+ resonance located at {approx}4.2 MeV.","","","","","","United States","2007-05-22T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: AIP Conference Proceedings; Journal Volume: 912; Journal Issue: 1; Conference: International symposium on exotic nuclei, Khanty-Mansiysk (Russian Federation), 17-22 Jul 2006; Other Information: DOI: 10.1063/1.2746578; (c) 2007 American Institute of Physics; Country of input: International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA)","","Medium: X; Size: page(s) 32-42","","","","Journal ID: ISSN 0094-243X; APCPCS; TRN: US07B4117076628","10.1063/1.2746578","","2010-06-03T00:00:00Z","21061816","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/21061816","","AIP Conference Proceedings","1","912"

The missing mass spectra were deduced from kinetic energies and emission angles of light ejectiles detected by the Silicon array MUST. In addition to previously known low-lying narrow resonant states in 9He, the d(8He,p) reaction displays a structure just above neutron emission threshold, identified with the 'true' ground state of 9He. The analysis of angular distributions shows that the inversion of s1/2 and p1/2 neutron shells previously observed in 11Be and 10Li also exists in the lightest N=7 isotone 9He. The d(8He,3He) and d(8He,6Li) reactions were used to search for resonant states in the t+4n (7H) and 4n systems, respectively. The missing mass spectrum of the 4n system does not give evidence for the existence of a bound 'tetraneutron'. However the comparison with the results of 5-body phase-space calculations emphasizes the existence of correlations in the 4n system. The broad structure observed at {approx_equal}2 MeV above the t+4n emission threshold is proposed to be the ground state of 7H.","","","","","","United States","2007-05-22T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: AIP Conference Proceedings; Journal Volume: 912; Journal Issue: 1; Conference: International symposium on exotic nuclei, Khanty-Mansiysk (Russian Federation), 17-22 Jul 2006; Other Information: DOI: 10.1063/1.2746575; (c) 2007 American Institute of Physics; Country of input: International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA)","","Medium: X; Size: page(s) 3-12","","","","Journal ID: ISSN 0094-243X; APCPCS; TRN: US07B4125076636","10.1063/1.2746575","","2010-06-03T00:00:00Z","21061824","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/21061824","","AIP Conference Proceedings","1","912"

The highly proton-rich nucleus /sup 24/Si has been produced via the /sup 24/Mg(/sup 3/He,3n) reaction. A cryogenic helium jet and a recoil time-of-flight mass analyzer system were constructed for use in observing short-lived beta-delayed particle emitters. The half-life of /sup 24/Si was found to be 103(42) ms, and the energy of the protons de-exciting the T = 2 state in the daughter, /sup 24/Al, has been measured as 3912.7(37) keV. From detailed consideration of masses in the A = 24 completed isobaric quintet, it is concluded that this quintet constitutes a test of the quadratic isobaric multiplet mass equation (IMME) as precise as the mass 9 quartet and that there is, in this case, no significant departure from the equation. Measurements of the Q values for the reactions /sup 10/Be(p,t)/sup 8/Be(T = 2) and /sup 10/Be(p,/sup 3/He)/sup 8/Li(T = 2) have been carried out using an Enge split-pole magnetic spectrograph. Data were recorded on photographic plates and analyzed using the MSU plate-screening system. The Q values determined were -27484.3(14) keV and -26821.3(57) keV for the /sup 8/Be and /sup 8/Li experiments respectively. These measurements have removed the deviation from the quadratic IMME that existed previous to these results. An analysis of all A = 4n isobaric quintets (five complete) for A less than or equal to 44 has been carried out. Predictions for missing members have been made using the quadratic IMME. In no case has any significant deviation from the quadratic form of the isobaric multiplet mass equation been found. This leaves only the mass 9 ground state quartet where a known deviation is present and where sources of significant experimental error have probably been eliminated.","Michigan State Univ.,East Lansing,MI","University Microfilms Order No. 83-03,819.","Michigan State Univ., East Lansing (USA)","","","United States","1982-01-01T00:00:00Z","English","Thesis/Dissertation","","Other Information: Thesis (Ph.

These achievements have led to many new applications and uses where the more conventional materials were deficient. Many of these high technology developments and their use to control corrosion problems have plagued industry for decades. The introduction of the argon--oxygen decarburization (AOD) refining of stainless steels has permitted new alloys such as AL-6X and the stabilized ferritics to become commercially available. The improvements in vacuum induction melting, achieving ultra low levels of interstitials, has resulted in the increased availability of high chromium--molybdenum ferritics. While these alloys will never be as popular as the 18-8 austenitics, their specific and unique characteristics offer solutions to many severe corrosion problems. The chemical composition, mechanical properties, and the development of several austenitic and ferritic stainless steels are reviewed. Corrosion data from a variety of environments are presented for comparison purposes. Additional corrosion data is developed for specific applications. Particular emphasis is placed on pitting and crevice corrosion resistance as it affects these new alloys as well as standard stainless steels in both fresh and sea water exposures. Several examples of using these materials to solve problems, with particular emphasis on energy systems, are cited.","","","Allegheny Ludlum Steel Corp., Brackenridge, PA","","","United States","1979-06-01T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: J.

Only levels consistent with direct, single-step two-proton pickup reaction mechanisms were observed to be strongly populated. On T/sub z/ = 0 targets, the spectroscopic selectivity of this reaction resembles that of the analogous (p,t) reaction. Additionally, these data demonstrate the dominance of spatially symmetric transfer of the two protons. On T/sub z/ greater than 0 targets the (/sup 6/Li,/sup 8/B) reaction was employed to locate two previously unreported levels (at 7.47 +- 0.05 MeV and 8.86 +- 0.07 MeV) in the T/sub z/ = 2 nuclide /sup 24/Ne and to establish the low-lying 1p-shell states in the T/sub z/ = /sup 3///sub 2/ nuclei /sup 11/Be, /sup 9/Li, and /sup 7/He. However, no evidence was seen for any narrow levels in the T/sub z/ = /sup 3///sub 2/ nuclide /sup 5/H nor for any narrow excited states in /sup 7/He. The angular distributions reported here are rather featureless and decrease monotonically with increasing angle. This behavior can be shown by a semi-classical reaction theory to be a consequence of the reaction kinematics. A semi-classical approach also suggests that the kinematic term in the transition matrix element is only weakly dependent upon the angular momentum transfer (which is consistent with simple Distorted Wave Born Approximation calculations). However, only qualitative agreement was obtained between the observed relative transition yields and semi-classical predictions, using the two-nucleon coefficients of fractional parentage of Cohen and Kurath, probably due to the limitations of the semi-classical reaction theory.","","Dep.

The only readily available data on Li/sup 8/ Bremsstrahlung is a calculation of the dose to the payload some 30 feet away from the primary system in a flight configuration. The major source is the boiler due to its small tubes which provide little attenuation in the lithium before the Li/sup 8/ betas stike columbium. Scaling this data for the boiler using a 1/R/sup 2/ dependence yields a dose rate of 120 rads/hr 3 feet from the boiler. The dose to the Payload due to the rest of the piping, etc. is about equal to the dose from the boiler so that the dose near any particular pipe will be considerably lower than the dose near the boiler.","","NTIS, PC A02/MF A01.","Pratt and Whitney Aircraft, Middletown, CT (USA)","","","United States","1964-06-15T00:00:00Z","English","Technical Report","","","","Medium: ED; Size: Pages: 3","","CNLM-5763","AC02-84PW02789","ON: DE84007127","10.2172/5188090","","2016-05-30T00:00:00Z","5188090","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/5188090","https://www.osti.gov/servlets/purl/5188090","","",""

The first step consists of hydrofluorination of the elements in a bath of molten fluoride salts using an HF sparge. In this case the two salt systems considered were NaF-ZrF/sub 4/ and NaF- LiF. Materials evaluated at Battelle for possible use in the construction of this hydrofluorinator include Inconel, A'' Nickel, copper, silver, Monel, Hastelloy B, Hastelloy W, INOR-1, and INOR-8. The metals were exposed to molten fluoride salts through which HF was bubbled continuously. The data indicate that the NaF-LiF systems are much more corrosive than the NaF-ZrF/sub 4/ system. The systems are most corrosive when the alkali fluoride component is high. An elevation in temperature increases the corrosion significantly as does an increase in the HF flow rate. Hydrogen in the HF flow stream retards the corrosion of the sodiumzirconium salts significantly, but appears to have less effect on the sodium -lithium systems. The areas at the interface of the liquid and vapor phases were most seriously damaged under the exposure conditions usually used. However, appreciable reduction in attack was experienced when zirconium was actually hydrofluorinated. INOR-8 was the most promising of the materials evaluated.

An investigation of the creep properties of annealed and of 15% coldworked Zircaloy-2 in the 290 to 400 deg C temperature range is being conducted. Research to develop a method of sink-float density measurements to identify factors affecting irradiation-induced volume changes in graphite was continued. An increase in the U content of Al-U alloys is desirable as a means of increasing the fuel loading of reactors utilizing these fuels. The development of the radiometric method for the analysis of Mg in cement was completed. A study of the solidification of U castings in cylindrical graphite molds is being conducted. Experimental work was continued to reduce the amount of additive oxide (La/sub 2/O/sub 3/, CaO, and Y/sub 2/O/sub 3/) required to achieve stabilization of uranium oxides. Additional H/sub 2/-adsorption isotherms were obtained for the Zr-25 wt.% U alloy. An irradiation surveillance program is being conducted to determine the effect of fast neutrons on the mechanical properties of type 347 stainless steel. The study concerned with the properties of Nb-U alloys was continued. A program is being conducted to investigate methods for improving the irradiation behavior and corrosion properties of Th -U alloys. An investigation is being made of cermet fuel materials consisting of from 60 to 90 vol. % of U0/sub 2/, UN, or UC dispersed in stainless steel. Gas-pressure bonding of Mo- and Nb-clad fuel elements is reported. A study to evaluate the irradiation resistance of dispersion fuel elements consisting of UC or UN fuel dispersed in a stainless steel matrix clad with stainless steel is reported. Fatigue studies of Inconel and INOR-8 are reported. A study of the constitution of U-Nb alloys is being conducted. Fundamental studies are being made of the kinetics and mechanism of the reaction of N/sub 2/ with Nb. The examination and evaluation of six 1.5-inch-diameter fueled (U0/sub 2/) graphite spheres after irradiation is reported. Localized attack on Ti steam tubes exposed to Darex dissolver solutions appears to be connected with defective areas in the tubes. Heat treatment of Ni-o-nel for 0.5 hr at 1850 deg F with an air quench following welding has produced the most resistance to Thorex solutions of any treatmert studied. The conditions prevailing during dissolution of Type 304 stainless steel in boiling 6 M H/sub 2/ SO/sub 4/ give corrosion rates in the range of 2 to 3 mils per month for Ni-o-nel specimens exposed to the vapor. Scouting experiments have shown the Zirflex decladding solution to be excessively corrosive to Type 347 and Carpenter 20 Cb stainless steels and Ni-o-nel. Raising the temperature from 650 to 700 deg C practically doubles the corrosiveness of the equimolar NaF-ZrF/sub 4/ salt. The evaluation of UC as a fuel for the SRE is proceeding. The amount of fission product Xe/sup 133/ released from UC as a function of time and temperature of post-irradiation heating was determined. The results of measurements of fission- gas release from Th-11 wt. % U specimers are reported. The effects of radiation and corrosion by the organic moderator on certain structural materials planned for use in the Organic Moderated Reactor are being studied. Properties of arc- melted Ta and Ta-W alloys are presented. A flat-plate Zircaloy-2-clad fuel element containing compartmented U0/sub 2 fuel is being considered for Core 2 of the PWR. The postirradiation examination of two stainless steel-clad U0/sub 2/ specimens for the Maritime Gas-Cooled Reactor program is continuing. Experiments leading to the development of a BeO--U0/sub 2/ fuel element were begun. (For preceding period see BMI-1304.)

The rate of exchange closely parallels the basicity of the hydrocarbon and can be predicted from the partial rate factors for the deuteration of the monoalkylbenzenes. The results provide further evidence that steric effects arc small for deuteration in trifluoroacetic acid and give approximate values for the meta partial rate factor for several alkyl groups.","American Chemical Society (ACS)","","Univ. of Minnesota, Minneapolis","USDOE","","Country unknown/Code not available","1958-12-01T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: Journal of the American Chemical Society; Journal Volume: 80; Journal Issue: 23; Other Information: Orig.
