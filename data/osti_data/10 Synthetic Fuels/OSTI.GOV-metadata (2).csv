This catalyst is also active for the sequential reaction of deoxydehydration and transfer hydrogenation in isopropanol, synthesizing renewable succinic acid and its esters from tartaric acid.

The coal-direct chemical looping (CDCL) process is a CLC technology that uses a moving bed reducer configuration that can directly consume coal as a feedstock without requiring an upstream gasification step. An integrated 250 kW<sub>th</sub> CDCL pilot unit using iron-based oxygen carriers was constructed and demonstrated for over 1000 h of testing. The principles for the CDCL pilot unit design and operation are summarized in this article. During the 288-hour continuous operation testing, the CDCL pilot unit achieved >96% coal conversion with a CO<sub>2</sub> purity of >97%. Low carbon carryover into the combustor, i.e. <2%, was also confirmed during the test, which shows the capability of the moving bed reactor to retain and convert coal using the oxygen available on the iron-based oxygen carrier.

"The current status of high temperature electrochemistry-based CO<sub>2</sub> transport membranes and reactors for direct CO<sub>2</sub> capture and conversion","Zhang, Peng; Tong, Jingjing; Huang, Kevin; Zhu, Xuefeng; Yang, Weishen","10 SYNTHETIC FUELS; 25 ENERGY STORAGE; 42 ENGINEERING; Thermodynamics; Energy & Fuels; Engineering; Carbon capture; Membrane; Electrochemical; Catalytic; Reactor","The concept of direct CO<sub>2</sub> capture and conversion has attracted significant interest from industries and academia in recent decades due to its potential to address the current grand challenge of global warming/climate change, rapid depletion of fossil fuels and realization of a future carbon neutral ecosystem. The incumbent benchmark technology for CO<sub>2</sub> capture is the post-combustion flue-gas “amine washing”, which is energy intensive and costly for large-scale commercial implementation. The CO<sub>2</sub> conversion technologies, on the other hand, are still at their infancy with many technical challenges to overcome, but primarily being explored in laboratory-scale, low-temperature, solution-based and high-temperature, solid-oxide-based electrochemical cells with renewable electricity perceived as the energy input. In this article, we provide a comprehensive overview on an emergent class of high-temperature electrochemical CO<sub>2</sub> transport membranes that can capture and convert CO<sub>2</sub> into valuable chemicals in single catalytic reactor fashion. The review starts with the chemistry and transport theory of three basic types of membranes purposely designed for different CO<sub>2</sub> feedstocks and downstream conversions. A range of key functional materials used in these membranes and their microstructural/electrochemical properties important to the CO<sub>2</sub> transport are then thoroughly discussed in conjunction with the effects of surface modifications and operating conditions. Several types of combined CO<sub>2</sub> capture and conversion catalytic reactors based on these membranes are also assessed with a focus on their working principles, system configurations and performance demonstrations. Finally, challenges and prospective of these electrochemical CO<sub>2</sub> transport membranes and their associated conversion reactors are candidly discussed for future development.","Elsevier","","Arizona State Univ., Tempe, AZ (United States)","USDOE Office of Fossil Energy (FE)","","United States","2020-11-07T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: Progress in Energy and Combustion Science; Journal Volume: 82; Journal Issue: C","","Medium: ED; Size: Article No. 100888","","","FE0031634","Journal ID: ISSN 0360-1285; PII: S0360128520300988","10.1016/j.pecs.2020.100888","","2022-07-26T00:00:00Z","1849280","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/1849280","https://www.osti.gov/servlets/purl/1849280","Progress in Energy and Combustion Science","C","82"
"Performance and long-term stability of CO<sub>2</sub> conversion to formic acid using a three-compartment electrolyzer design","Yang, Hongzhou; Kaczur, Jerry J.; Sajjad, Syed Dawar; Masel, Richard I.","10 SYNTHETIC FUELS; Electrochemical CO2 reduction; Three-compartment electrolyzer; Formic acid; Formic acid catalyst stability","The electrochemical reduction of CO<sub>2</sub> to formate and formic acid has attracted a great amount of academic and commercial interest over the past five years. A number of experimental studies have generated data on the Faradaic performance and stability of various candidate catalyst materials in producing formate or formic acid. However, most of the data has been conducted at low current densities and over short time periods, typically hours to days. There is a critical need in providing long-term catalyst stability as well as electrolyzer-based operating data, which are needed for the commercial scale-up and operation of this technology, especially at high current densities. In this paper, the electrochemical CO<sub>2</sub> conversion to pure formic acid was conducted using a three-compartment design electrolyzer, demonstrating electrolyzer catalyst and performance stability for over 1000 h at current densities up to 200 mA cm<sup>-2</sup>. Depending on the operation conditions, the electrolyzer directly produced a 6.03 to 12.92 wt% (1.3 to 2.8 M) formic acid product at Faradaic efficiencies ranging between 73.0 to 91.3%. Data on electrolyzer performance, including formic acid product generation rate, energy efficiency, and energy consumption are reported at three different current densities, 100, 200, and 250 mA cm<sup>-2</sup>. Finally, a long term 1000 h electrolyzer stability run at 200 mA cm<sup>-2</sup> is presented, providing information on the operating conditions required in obtaining stable electrolyzer performance. All the data will be extremely useful in the commercial scale-up of this technology.","Elsevier","","Dioxide Materials, Inc., Boca Raton, FL (United States)","USDOE Office of Fossil Energy (FE), Clean Coal and Carbon Management","","United States","2020-10-30T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: Journal of CO2 Utilization; Journal Volume: 42; Related Information: https://ars.els-cdn.com/content/image/1-s2.0-S2212982020309793-mmc1.zip","","Medium: ED; Size: Article No. 101349","","","FE0031706","Journal ID: ISSN 2212-9820","10.1016/j.jcou.2020.101349","","2021-11-01T00:00:00Z","1700693","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/1700693","https://www.osti.gov/servlets/purl/1700693","Journal of CO2 Utilization","","42"

"Hybrid Fuel Cell—Supercritical CO<sub>2</sub> Brayton Cycle for CO<sub>2</sub> Sequestration-Ready Combined Heat and Power","Ghotkar, Rhushikesh; Stechel, Ellen B.; Ermanoski, Ivan; Milcarek, Ryan J.","10 SYNTHETIC FUELS; Energy & Fuels; supercritical CO2; combined heat and power; flame-assisted fuel cells; carbon sequestration; solid oxide fuel cell","The low prices and its relatively low carbon intensity of natural gas have encouraged the coal replacement with natural gas power generation. Such a replacement reduces greenhouse gases and other emissions. To address the significant energy penalty of carbon dioxide (CO<sub>2</sub>) sequestration in gas turbine systems, a novel high efficiency concept is proposed and analyzed, which integrates a flame-assisted fuel cell (FFC) with a supercritical CO<sub>2</sub> (sCO<sub>2</sub>) Brayton cycle air separation. The air separation enables the exhaust from the system to be CO<sub>2</sub> sequestration-ready. The FFC provides the heat required for the sCO<sub>2</sub> cycle. Heat rejected from the sCO<sub>2</sub> cycle provides the heat required for adsorption-desorption pumping to isolate oxygen via air separation. The maximum electrical efficiency of the FFC sCO<sub>2</sub> turbine hybrid (FFCTH) without being CO<sub>2</sub> sequestration-ready is 60%, with the maximum penalty being 0.68% at a fuel-rich equivalence ratio (&Phi;) of 2.8, where &Phi; is proportional to fuel-air ratio. This electrical efficiency is higher than the standard sCO<sub>2</sub> cycle by 6.85%. The maximum power-to-heat ratio of the sequestration-ready FFCTH is 233 at a &Phi; = 2.8. Even after including the air separation penalty, the electrical efficiency is higher than in previous studies.","MDPI","","Arizona State Univ., Tempe, AZ (United States)","USDOE Office of Energy Efficiency and Renewable Energy (EERE), Renewable Power Office.

"Co-optimizing water-alternating-carbon dioxide injection projects using a machine learning assisted computational framework","You, Junyu; Ampomah, William; Sun, Qian","10 SYNTHETIC FUELS; Energy & Fuels; Engineering; Carbon dioxide sequestration; CO<sub>2</sub>-EOR; Multi-objective optimization; Artificial neural network","In this report, a robust machine-learning-based computational framework that couples multi-layer neural network (MLNN) proxies and a multi-objective particle swarm optimizer (MOPSO) to design water-alternating-carbon dioxide injection (CO<sub>2</sub>-WAG) projects is presented. The proposed optimization protocol considers various objectives, including oil recovery and CO<sub>2</sub> storage volume. Expert MLNN systems are trained and employed as surrogate models of the high-fidelity compositional simulator in the optimization workflow. When multiple objective functions are considered, two approaches are employed to treat the objectives: the weighted sum method and the Pareto-front-based scheme. A field-scale implementation focusing on tertiary recovery in the Morrow B formation at Farnsworth Unit (FWU) is presented. The developed Pareto-optimal solutions indicate the maximal available oil production can be 1.64 × 10<sup>7</sup> barrels and maximal carbon storage can achieve 2.35 × 10<sup>7</sup> tons. Trade-offs factor is defined to divide the constructed Pareto front into 4 sections with the trade-off factors’ value ranges from 0.35 to 49.9. This work also compares the optimum solution found by the aggregative objective function and the solution repository covered by the Pareto front that considers the physical and operational constraints and reduces uncertainties involved by the multi-objective optimization process. Our comparison indicates multiple solutions exist to satisfy the objective criteria of the WAG design, and these results cannot be found using the traditional weighted sum method. The Pareto front solution can provide more options for project designers, but decisions regarding necessary trade-offs must be made using the solution repository to balance the project economics and CO<sub>2</sub> storage amount.","Elsevier","","New Mexico Institute of Mining and Technology, Socorro, NM (United States)","USDOE Office of Fossil Energy (FE)","","United States","2020-09-06T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: Applied Energy; Journal Volume: 279; Journal Issue: C","","Medium: ED; Size: Article No. 115695","","","FC26-05NT42591","Journal ID: ISSN 0306-2619; PII: S0306261920311910","10.1016/j.apenergy.2020.115695","","2022-06-16T00:00:00Z","1849087","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/1849087","https://www.osti.gov/servlets/purl/1849087","Applied Energy","C","279"

We demonstrate that biogenic methane and ethylene from terrestrial and freshwater bacteria are directly produced by a previously unknown methionine biosynthesis pathway. This pathway, present in numerous species, uses a nitrogenase-like reductase that is distinct from known nitrogenases and nitrogenase-like reductases and specifically functions in C–S bond breakage to reduce ubiquitous and appreciable volatile organic sulfur compounds such as dimethyl sulfide and (2-methylthio)ethanol. Liberated methanethiol serves as the immediate precursor to methionine, while ethylene or methane is released into the environment. Anaerobic ethylene production by this pathway apparently explains the long-standing observation of ethylene accumulation in oxygen-depleted soils. Methane production reveals an additional bacterial pathway distinct from archaeal methanogenesis.","AAAS","","The Ohio State Univ., Columbus, OH (United States); Oak Ridge National Lab.

Of particular interest is the production of middle distillate fuels (i.e., jet and diesel blendstock) from renewable ethanol feedstock. State-of-the-art alcohol-to-jet technology requires multiple process steps based on the catalytic dehydration of ethanol to ethylene, followed by a multistep oligomerization including n-butene formation and then hydrotreatment and distillation. In this paper we report that, over Ag-ZrO<sub>2</sub>/SBA-16 with balanced metal and Lewis acid sites, ethanol is directly converted to n-butene (1- and 2-butene mixtures) with an exceptional butene-rich olefin selectivity of 88% at 99% conversion. The need for the ethanol dehydration to ethylene step is eliminated. Thus, it offers the potential for a reduction in the number of required processing units versus conventional alcohol-to-jet technology. We also found that the C<sub>4</sub> product distribution, n-butene and/or 1,3-butadiene, can be tailored on this catalyst by tuning the hydrogen feed partial pressure and other process/catalyst parameters. With sufficient hydrogen partial pressure, 1,3-butadiene is completely and selectively hydrogenated to form n-butene. The reaction mechanism was elucidated through operando-nuclear magnetic resonance investigations coupled with reactivity measurements. Ethanol is first dehydrogenated to acetaldehyde over the metallic Ag, then acetaldehyde is converted to crotonaldehyde over the acid sites of ZrO<sub>2</sub>/SiO<sub>2</sub> via aldol condensation followed by dehydration. This is followed by a Meerwein–Ponndorf–Verley reduction of crotonaldehyde to butadiene intermediate that is hydrogenated into n-butene over metallic Ag and ZrO<sub>2</sub>. A minor fraction of n-butene is also produced from crotonaldehyde reduction to butyraldehyde instead of butadiene. Isotopically labeled ethanol NMR experiments demonstrated that ethanol, rather than H<sub>2</sub>, is the source of H for the hydrogenation of crotonaldehyde to butyraldehyde. Combined experimental-computational investigation reveals how changes in silver and zirconium composition and the silver oxidation state affects reactivity under controlled hydrogen partial pressures and after prolonged run times. Finally, catalyst effectiveness also was demonstrated when using wet ethanol feed, thus highlighting process flexibility in terms of feedstock purity requirements.","American Chemical Society (ACS)","External Audience (Unlimited)","Lawrence Livermore National Lab.

The multicomponent catalyst system was highly active for converting hydrogen and carbon dioxide to methanol, and it could be formulated so that it is readily recyclable. Moreover, an autocatalytic feature was uncovered that was only made possible by utilizing the multicomponent catalyst strategy employed.

To maintain grid stability and reliability, electrical generation must be regulated to match the load at the proper voltage and frequency. With the expansion of intermittent sources into the grid, such as wind and solar, frequency and voltage regulation become increasingly important and challenging. This work presents the results of a Front End Engineering Design (FEED) effort to detail the engineering and preliminary economics of a small-scale, air blown, fixed-bed gasification process, operating at near-atmospheric pressure, with gas cleanup to provide syngas and pyrolysis liquid fuels for use in reciprocating engine generators for combined heat and power at the University of Alaska Fairbanks. A very detailed assessment of capital and operating costs allows the evaluation of a levelized cost of electricity of 208.06 $/MWh, which can be reduced through the selling of by-products (steam for heating purposes and pyrolysis liquids to be used for power generation in an existing diesel engine). Here, a combined sensitivity analysis, based on the Monte Carlo approach, has been carried out to evaluate the effects of the uncertainties (capital and operating costs and plant annual availability) on the LCOE.","Elsevier","","National Energy Technology Laboratory (NETL), Pittsburgh, PA, Morgantown, WV, and Albany, OR (United States)","USDOE Office of Fossil Energy (FE), Clean Coal and Carbon Management","","United States","2020-02-07T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: Fuel; Journal Volume: 267; Conference: The 9.

Ammonia exiting a synthesis reactor can be separated from nitrogen and hydrogen by absorption into magnesium chloride. Such an absorption can be more complete and hotter than separation via ammonia condensation, the current standard in the Haber–Bosch process. Here, we discuss the optimal conditions for the cyclic uptake and release of ammonia from the supported magnesium chloride absorbents. An automated system was designed for measuring the nonequilibrium working capacity of the absorbent, as well as the impact of important operating conditions such as absorption and desorption temperature, pressure, and desorption time. Measurements of absorption and desorption kinetics provide insight into the mechanisms involved. The temperatures and pressures during absorption and desorption were designed to use minimal energy input to maximize the uptake and release of ammonia within a reasonable amount of time. In a laboratory-scale bed, absorption has a small unused bed length, so it is largely independent of mass transfer; it is dominated by how fast ammonia is fed to the bed. Yet, desorption is restricted both by the speed of heating the bed and by diffusion out of the absorbent. These measurements provide guidelines for ammonia separations and cycling sorbent materials on a larger scale.","American Chemical Society (ACS)","","Univ. of Minnesota, Minneapolis, MN (United States)","USDOE Advanced Research Projects Agency - Energy (ARPA-E)","","United States","2020-02-07T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: ACS Applied Energy Materials; Journal Volume: 3; Journal Issue: 3; Related Information: Supplementary figures; calibration curve of bed temperature; cycling stability of the absorbent; cycling breakthrough curves; and simplified apparatus of conventional and prototype ammonia synthesis systems.","","Medium: ED; Size: p. 2576-2584","","","AR0000804","Journal ID: ISSN 2574-0962","10.1021/acsaem.9b02278","","2023-01-23T00:00:00Z","1616472","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/1616472","https://www.osti.gov/servlets/purl/1616472","ACS Applied Energy Materials","3","3"

The elastomer materials included two fluorocarbons, six acrylonitrile butadiene rubbers (NBRs), and one each of fluorosilicone, neoprene, polyurethane, styrene butadiene rubber (SBR), and silicone. The ketone molecules included acetone, 2-butanone, 2-pentanone, 2-nonanone, and cyclopentanone. The ketones were added to gasoline containing 10% ethanol (E10) and a blendstock for oxygenate blending (BOB) in levels ranging from 0% to 30% by volume. The elastomers were exposed for 4 weeks in each test fluid. The solubility was modeled using Hansen solubility parameters and the volume change was determined for each material and test fuel. In general, the volume swell increased with ketone content and corresponded well to the predicted solubilities. In most cases, the highest level of swelling occurred with added cyclopentanone and acetone, while 2-nonanone produced the lowest levels of volume expansion. The chain length of the straight ketones was found to affect the volume swell behavior as volume expansion decreased with increasing chain length. This behavior is attributed to the reduction in polarity and hydrogen bonding with chain length. Neoprene, SBR, and silicone exhibited poor compatibility with the ketone molecules at all blend levels. Fluorocarbon and fluorosilicone also showed poor compatibility but may be suitable for use as static seals in very low blend levels with 2-nonanone. The results were more mixed for polyurethane and the NBRs. In general, better compatibility (low volume swell) was observed for mixtures containing BOB than for E10. This is due to the lower polarity and hydrogen bonding of the BOB.</p>","","","Oak Ridge National Lab.

This basic question has plagued the molecular electrocatalysis community during its decades-long search for selective and efficient transition-metal based electrocatalysts for fuel forming reactions. Identifying when the added species is a precatalyst that transforms into the active catalyst in situ is an extraordinarily complex endeavor. Thankfully, the last decade has witnessed a resurgence of interest in understanding and controlling these transformations, leading to an expansion of the experimental toolkit available to probe catalyst identity. Here in this Tutorial Review, researchers will learn how the nature of the active catalyst can be uncovered using state-of-the-art electrochemical and spectroscopic methods. Analysis of catalytic voltammograms can quickly furnish qualitative evidence of precatalyst transformation and a library of these tell-tale signs is discussed, along with the chemical phenomena underpinning each feature. Complementary electrochemical and spectroscopic methods for identifying in situ generation of heterogeneous catalysts are also presented, outlining the conditions required for correct application with special emphasis on potential pitfalls when studying weakly-adsorbed material. Case studies are presented to showcase how these different probes can be integrated to develop a comprehensive picture of precatalyst transformation.","Royal Society of Chemistry","","Univ. of North Carolina, Chapel Hill, NC (United States)","USDOE Office of Science (SC), Basic Energy Sciences (BES)","","United States","2019-05-15T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: Chemical Society Reviews; Journal Volume: 48; Journal Issue: 11","","Medium: ED; Size: p. 2927-2945","","","SC0015303","Journal ID: ISSN 0306-0012; CSRVBR","10.1039/C8CS00851E","","2021-10-28T00:00:00Z","1604867","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/1604867","https://www.osti.gov/servlets/purl/1604867","Chemical Society Reviews","11","48"

The four-week experiment included 191 vibroseis source locations, and approximately 130 m of distributed acoustic sensing (DAS) in a vertical well, located at the southern end of the survey area. The imaging of the geothermal faults is done with reverse time migration of the DAS data for both P-P and P-S events in order to generate 3D models of reflectivity, which can identify subsurface fault locations. Three scenarios of receiver data are explored to investigate the reliability of the reflectivity models obtained: (1) Migration of synthetic P-P and P-S DAS data, (2) migration of the observed field DAS data and (3) migration of pure random noise to better assess the validity of our results. The comparisons of the 3D reflectivity models from these three scenarios confirm that sections of three known faults at Brady produce reflected energy observed by the DAS. Two faults that are imaged are ~1 km away from the DAS well; one of these faults (middle west-dipping) is well-constructed for over 400 m along the fault’s strike, and 300 m in depth. These results confirm that the DAS data, together with an imaging engine such as reverse time migration, can be used to position important geothermal features such as faults.","MDPI AG","","Temple Univ., Philadelphia, PA (United States); Univ. of Wisconsin, Madison, WI (United States)","USDOE Office of Energy Efficiency and Renewable Energy (EERE)","","United States","2019-04-01T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: Energies; Journal Volume: 12; Journal Issue: 7","","Medium: ED; Size: Article No. 1401","","","EE0005510; EE0006760","Journal ID: ISSN 1996-1073; ENERGA; PII: en12071401","10.3390/en12071401","","2021-10-28T00:00:00Z","1613302","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/1613302","https://www.osti.gov/servlets/purl/1613302","Energies","7","12"

Systematic research with transmission electron microscopy, X-ray diffraction, X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy, and X-ray absorption spectroscopy (XAS) showed that critical parameters governing the activity of MoP catalysts are P/Mo ratio and K loading, both facilitating MoP formation. The kinetic studies of mesoporous silica-supported MoP catalysts show a twofold role of K, which also acts as an electronic promoter by increasing the total alcohol selectivity and chain length. Palladium (Pd) increases CO conversion, but decreases alcohol chain length.

However, the emissions-intensive nature of the Haber–Bosch process, as well as a depleting supply of these fossil fuels have motivated the production of ammonia using renewable sources of energy. Small-scale, distributed processes may better enable the use of renewables, but also result in a loss of economies of scale, so the high capital cost of the Haber–Bosch process may inhibit this paradigm shift. A process that operates at lower pressure and uses absorption rather than condensation to remove ammonia from unreacted nitrogen and hydrogen has been proposed as an alternative. In this work, a dynamic model of this absorbent-enhanced process is proposed and implemented in gPROMS ModelBuilder. This dynamic model is used to determine optimal designs of this process that minimize the 20-year net present cost at small scales of 100 kg/h to 10,000 kg/h when powered by wind energy.

The first process is the direct electrochemical generation of pure formic acid in a three-compartment cell configuration using the alkaline stable anion exchange membrane and a cation exchange membrane. The cell operates at a current density of 140 mA/cm<sup>2</sup> at a cell voltage of 3.5 V. The power consumption for production of formic acid (FA) is about 4.3–4.7 kWh/kg of FA. The second process is the electrochemical conversion of CO<sub>2</sub> to CO, a key focus product in the generation of renewable fuels and chemicals. The CO<sub>2</sub> cell consists of a two-compartment design utilizing the alkaline stable anion exchange membrane to separate the anode and cathode compartments. A nanoparticle IrO<sub>2</sub> catalyst on a GDE structure is used as the anode and a GDE utilizing a nanoparticle Ag/imidazolium-based ionomer catalyst combination is used as a cathode. The CO<sub>2</sub> cell has been operated at current densities of 200 to 600 mA/cm<sup>2</sup> at voltages of 3.0 to 3.2 respectively with CO<sub>2</sub> to CO conversion selectivities of 95–99%. The third process is an alkaline water electrolysis cell process, where the alkaline stable anion exchange membrane allows stable cell operation in 1 M KOH electrolyte solutions at current densities of 1 A/cm<sup>2</sup> at about 1.90 V. The cell has demonstrated operation for thousands of hours, showing a voltage increase in time of only 5 μV/h. The alkaline electrolysis technology does not require any precious metal catalysts as compared to polymer electrolyte membrane (PEM) design water electrolyzers. Here, we discuss the detailed technical aspects of these three technologies utilizing this unique anion exchange membrane.","Frontiers Research Foundation","","Dioxide Materials, Boca Raton, FL (United States); 3M Company, Maplewood, MN (United States)","USDOE Advanced Research Projects Agency - Energy (ARPA-E)","LanzaTech, Skokie, IL (United States)","Switzerland","2018-07-03T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: Frontiers in Chemistry Journal Volume: 6","","Medium: X","","","SC0004453; AR0000684","Journal ID: ISSN 2296-2646; 263","10.3389/fchem.2018.00263","","2021-05-07T00:00:00Z","1458782","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/1458782","","Frontiers in Chemistry","","6"

Atomically dispersed Zn<sup>2+</sup> species are present in the framework within a thin surface shell (1.5-2.0 nm) of ZrO<sub>2</sub> particles when the Zn/Zr ratio is smaller than 1/10; when the ratio is above this, both atomically dispersed Zn<sup>2+</sup> and ZnO clusters coexist in mixed Zn<sub>x</sub>Zr<sub>y</sub>O<sub>z</sub> oxide catalysts. The presence of ZnO clusters shows no significant side effect but only a slight increase of selectivity to CO<sub>2</sub>, caused by steam reforming. The incorporation of atomic Zn<sup>2+</sup> into the ZrO<sub>2</sub> framework was found to not only passivate strong Lewis acid sites (i.e., Zr-O-Zr) on ZrO<sub>2</sub>, but to also generate new Lewis acid-base site pairs with enhanced Lewis basicity on the bridged O (i.e., <sub>Zr—o$\curvearrowleft\atop{e\atop—}$Zn</sub>). In the mixed ketone (i.e., acetone and methyl ethyl ketone (MEK)) reactions, while the passivation of strong acid sites can be correlated to the inhibition of side reactions, such as ketone decomposition and coking, the new Lewis acid-base pairs introduced enhance the cascade aldolization and self-deoxygenation reactions involved in olefin (C<sub>3</sub><sup>=</sup>-C<sub>6</sub><sup>=</sup>) production.

"Engineering E. coli for simultaneous glucose–xylose utilization during methyl ketone production","Wang, Xi; Goh, Ee-Been; Beller, Harry R. (ORCID:0000000196373650)","59 BASIC BIOLOGICAL SCIENCES; 10 SYNTHETIC FUELS; Carbon catabolite repression; Methyl ketones; NADPH; cAMP receptor protein; Metabolic engineering","Previously, we developed an E. coli strain that overproduces medium-chain methyl ketones for potential use as diesel fuel blending agents or as flavors and fragrances. To date, the strain's performance has been optimized during growth with glucose. However, lignocellulosic biomass hydrolysates also contain a substantial portion of hemicellulose-derived xylose, which is typically the second most abundant sugar after glucose. Commercialization of the methyl ketone-producing technology would benefit from the increased efficiency resulting from simultaneous, rather than the native sequential (diauxic), utilization of glucose and xylose. In this study, genetic manipulations were performed to alleviate carbon catabolite repression in our most efficient methyl ket one-producing strain. A strain engineered for constitutive expression of xylF and xylA (involved in xylose transport and metabolism) showed synchronized glucose and xylose consumption rates. However, this newly acquired capability came at the expense of methyl ketone titer, which decreased fivefold. Further efforts were made to improve methyl ketone production in this strain, and we found that two strategies were effective at enhancing methyl ketone titer: (1) chromosomal deletion of pgi (glucose-6-phosphate isomerase) to increase intracellular NADPH supply and (2) downregulation of CRP (cAMP receptor protein) expression by replacement of the native RBS with an RBS chosen based upon mutant library screening results. Combining these strategies resulted in the most favorable overall phenotypes for simultaneous glucose-xylose consumption without compromising methyl ketone titer at both 1 and 2% total sugar concentrations in shake flasks. This work demonstrated a strategy for engineering simultaneous utilization of C<sub>6</sub> and C<sub>5</sub> sugars in E. coli without sacrificing production of fatty acid-derived compounds.","Springer Science + Business Media","","Lawrence Berkeley National Lab.

By using atomic layer deposition together with conventional techniques, we synthesize Pt–Co bimetallic catalysts that show improvement for syngas conversion to alcohols. By combining reaction testing, X-ray diffraction, electron microscopy, and <i>in situ</i> infrared spectroscopy experiments, supported by density functional theory calculations, we uncover insights into how Pt modulates the selectivity of Co catalysts. The prepared Pt–Co catalysts demonstrate increased selectivity toward methanol and low molecular weight hydrocarbons as well as a modest increase in selectivity toward higher alcohols. The <i>in situ</i> infrared spectroscopic measurements suggest that these changes in selectivity result from an interplay between linear and bridging carbon monoxide configurations on the catalyst surface.","American Chemical Society","","SLAC National Accelerator Lab., Menlo Park, CA (United States)","USDOE Office of Science (SC), Basic Energy Sciences (BES); National Science Foundation (NSF)","","United States","2017-12-22T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: Journal of Physical Chemistry.

Challenges in synthesizing a wide variety of oxynitride materials has limited exploration of this class of functional materials, which we address using a reactive cosputtering combined with rapid thermal processing method to synthesize multi-cation–multi-anion libraries. We demonstrate the synthesis of a LaxTa1–xOyNz thin film composition spread library and its characterization by both traditional thin film materials characterization and custom combinatorial optical spectroscopy and X-ray absorption near edge spectroscopy (XANES) techniques, ultimately establishing structure-chemistry-property relationships. We observe that over a substantial La–Ta composition range the thin films crystallize in the same perovskite LaTaON2 structure with significant variation of anion chemistry. The relative invariance in optical band gap demonstrates a remarkable decoupling of composition and band energetics so that the composition can be optimized while retaining the desirable 2 eV band gap energy. We also demonstrate the intercalation of diatomic nitrogen into the La3TaO7 structure, which gives rise to a direct-allowed optical transition at 2.2 eV, less than half the value of the oxide’s band gap.

"Experimental and modeling studies of a biofuel surrogate compound: laminar burning velocities and jet-stirred reactor measurements of anisole","Wagnon, Scott W.; Thion, Sebastien; Nilsson, Elna J.

Pyrolysis is used to convert lignocellulosic biomass into a complex mixture of phenolic-rich species that can be used in a transportation fuel. Anisole (or methoxybenzene) can be used as a surrogate to represent these phenolic-rich species. Anisole also has attractive properties as a fuel component for use in advanced spark-ignition engines because of its high blending research octane number of 120. Presented in the current work are new measurements of laminar burning velocities, jet-stirred reactor (JSR) speciation of anisole/O<sub>2</sub>/N<sub>2</sub> mixtures, and the development and validation of a detailed chemical kinetic mechanism for anisole. Homogeneous, steady state, fixed gas temperature, perfectly stirred reactor CHEMKIN simulations were used to validate the mechanism against the current JSR measurements and published JSR experiments from CNRS-Nancy. Pyrolysis and oxidation simulations were based on the experimental reactant compositions and thermodynamic state conditions including P = 1 bar and T = 675–1275 K. The oxidation compositions studied in this work span fuel-lean (φ = 0.5), stoichiometric, and fuel rich (φ = 2.0) equivalence ratios. Laminar burning velocities were measured on a heat flux stabilized burner at an unburnt T = 358 K, P = 1 bar and simulated using the CHEMKIN premixed laminar flame speed module. Ignition delay times of anisole were then simulated at conditions relevant to advanced combustion strategies. Current laminar burning velocity measurements and predicted ignition delay times were compared to gasoline components (e.g., n-heptane, iso-octane, and toluene) and gasoline surrogates to highlight differences and similarities in behavior. Reaction path analysis and sensitivity analysis were used to explain the pathways relevant to the current studies. Under pyrolysis and oxidative conditions, unimolecular decomposition of anisole to phenoxy radicals and methyl radicals was found to be important due to the relatively low bond strength between the oxygen and methyl group, ~65 kcal/mol. Finally, reactions of these abundant phenoxy radicals with O<sub>2</sub> were found to be critical to accurately reproduce anisole's reactivity.","Elsevier","","Lawrence Livermore National Lab.

However, wind-generated ammonia costs about twice of that made from a traditional fossil-fuel driven process. To reduce the production cost, we replace the conventional ammonia condensation with a selective absorber containing metal halides, e.g. calcium chloride, operating at near synthesis temperatures. With this reaction-absorption process, ammonia can be synthesized at 20 bar from air, water, and wind-generated electricity, with rates comparable to the conventional process running at 150-300 bar. In our reaction-absorption process, the rate of ammonia synthesis is now controlled not by the chemical reaction, but largely by the pump used to recycle the unreacted gases. The results suggest an alternative route to distributed ammonia manufacture which can locally supply nitrogen fertilizer and also a method to capture stranded wind energy as a carbon-neutral liquid fuel.","American Chemical Society (ACS)","","Univ. of Minnesota, Minneapolis, MN (United States)","USDOE Advanced Research Projects Agency - Energy (ARPA-E)","","United States","2017-11-07T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: ACS Sustainable Chemistry & Engineering; Journal Volume: 6; Journal Issue: 1","","Medium: ED; Size: p. 827-834","","","AR0000804","Journal ID: ISSN 2168-0485; TRN: US1800320","10.1021/acssuschemeng.7b03159","","2021-08-30T00:00:00Z","1412658","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/1412658","https://www.osti.gov/servlets/purl/1412658","ACS Sustainable Chemistry & Engineering","1","6"
"Autoignition of trans -decalin, a diesel surrogate compound: Rapid compression machine experiments and chemical kinetic modeling","Wang, Mengyuan; Zhang, Kuiwen; Kukkadapu, Goutham; Wagnon, Scott W.; Mehl, Marco; Pitz, William J.; Sung, Chih-Jen","10 SYNTHETIC FUELS","Decahydronaphthalene (decalin), with both cis and trans isomers, is a bicyclic alkane that is found in aviation fuels, diesel fuels, and alternative fuels from tar sands and oil shales. Between the two decalin isomers, trans-decalin has a lower cetane number, is energetically more stable, and has a lower boiling point. Moreover, trans-decalin has often been chosen as a surrogate component to represent two-ring naphthenes in transportation fuels. Recognizing the importance of understanding the chemical kinetics of trans-decalin in the development of surrogate models, an experimental and modeling study has been conducted. Experimentally, the autoignition characteristics of trans-decalin were investigated using a rapid compression machine (RCM) by using trans-decalin/O2/N2 mixtures at compressed pressures of PC=10–25 bar, low-to-intermediate compressed temperatures of TC=620–895 K, and varying equivalence ratios of Φ=0.5, 1.0, and 2.0. These new experimental data demonstrate the effects of pressure, fuel loading, and oxygen concentration on autoignition of trans-decalin. The current RCM data of trans-decalin at lower temperatures were also found to complement well with the literature shock tube data of decalin (mixture of cis+trans) at higher temperatures. Furthermore, a chemical kinetic model for the oxidation of trans-decalin has been developed with new reaction rates and pathways, including, for the first time, a fully-detailed representation of low-temperature chemical kinetics for transdecalin. This model shows good agreement with the overall ignition delay results of the current RCM experiments and the literature shock tube studies. Chemical kinetic analyses of the developed model were further conducted to help identify the fuel decomposition pathways and the reactions controlling the autoignition at varying conditions.","Elsevier","External Audience (Unlimited)","Lawrence Livermore National Lab.

This study compares the well-to-wake (WtWa) greenhouse gas (GHG) emission performance of multiple RJF conversion pathways and explores the impact of different co-product allocation methods. The insights obtained in this study are of particular importance if RJF is included as an emission mitigation instrument in the global Carbon Offsetting and Reduction Scheme for International Aviation (CORSIA). Results: Fischer–Tropsch pathways yield the highest GHG emission reduction compared to fossil jet fuel (86–104%) of the pathways in scope, followed by Hydrothermal Liquefaction (77–80%) and sugarcane- (71–75%) and corn stover-based Alcohol-to-Jet (60–75%). Feedstock cultivation, hydrogen and conversion inputs were shown to be major contributors to the overall WtWa GHG emission performance. The choice of allocation method mainly affects pathways yielding high shares of co-products or producing co-products which effectively displace carbon intensive products (e.g., electricity). Conclusions: Renewable jet fuel can contribute to significant reduction of aviation-related GHG emissions, provided the right feedstock and conversion technology are used. The GHG emission performance of RJF may be further improved by using sustainable hydrogen sources or applying carbon capture and storage. Based on the character and impact of different co-product allocation methods, we recommend using energy and economic allocation (for non-energy co-products) at a global level, as it leverages the universal character of energy allocation while adequately valuing non-energy co-products.","BioMed Central","","Argonne National Lab.

In this work, the effects of fuel laminar flame speed on both lean and EGR dilute spark ignition combustion stability were examined. Fuels blends of pure components (iso-octane, n-heptane, toluene, ethanol, and methanol) were derived at two levels of laminar flame speed. Each fuel blend was tested in a single-cylinder spark-ignition engine under both lean-out and EGR dilution sweeps until the coefficient of variance of indicated mean effective pressure increased above thresholds of 3% and 5%. The relative importance of fuel laminar flame speed to changes to engine design parameters (spark ignition energy, tumble ratio, and port vs. direct injection) was also assessed. Our results showed that fuel laminar flame speed can have as big an effect on lean or EGR dilute engine operation as engine design parameters, with the largest effects seen during EGR dilute operation and when changes were made to cylinder charge motion.","SAE International","","Argonne National Lab.

Haloalcaliphilic methanotrophic bacteria belonging to the genus <i>Methylomicrobium</i> are among the most promising strains for methane-based biotechnology, providing easy and inexpensive cultivation, rapid growth, and the availability of established genetic tools. A number of methane bioconversions using these microbial cultures have been discussed, including the derivation of biodiesel, alkanes, and OMEGA-3 supplements. These compounds are derived from bacterial fatty acid pools. Here, we investigate fatty acid biosynthesis in <i>Methylomicrobium buryatense 5G(B1)</i>. Most of the genes homologous to typical Type II fatty acid biosynthesis pathways could be annotated by bioinformatics analyses, with the exception of FA transport and regulatory elements. Different approaches for improving fatty acid accumulation were investigated. These studies indicated that both fatty acid degradation and acetyl- and malonyl-CoA levels are bottlenecks for higher level fatty acid production. The best strain generated in this study synthesizes 111 ± 2 mg/gDCW of extractable fatty acids, which is ~20% more than the original strain. A candidate gene for FA-biosynthesis regulation, <i>farE</i>, was identified and studied. Its deletion resulted in drastic changes to the FA profile, leading to an increased pool of C18-fatty acid methyl ester. The FarE-regulon was further investigated by RNA-seq analysis of gene expression in <i>farE</i>-knockout mutants and <i>farE</i>-overexpressing strains. These gene profiles highlighted a novel set of enzymes and regulators involved in fatty acid biosynthesis. As a result, the gene expression and fatty acid profiles of the different <i>farE</i>-strains support the hypothesis that metabolic fluxes upstream of fatty acid biosynthesis restrict fatty acid production in the methanotroph.","Frontiers Research Foundation","","San Diego State Univ., CA (United States)","USDOE Advanced Research Projects Agency - Energy (ARPA-E)","","United States","2017-01-10T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: Frontiers in Microbiology; Journal Volume: 7","","Medium: ED; Size: 11 p.","","","AR0000438","Journal ID: ISSN 1664-302X","10.3389/fmicb.2016.02167","","2021-12-30T00:00:00Z","1338332","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/1338332","https://www.osti.gov/servlets/purl/1338332","Frontiers in Microbiology","","7"

In an earlier study, Bayesian UQ analysis was applied to existing bench-scale fluidized-bed gasifier experiment results. In the current study, a series of simulations were carried over with the open-source computational fluid dynamics software MFiX to reproduce the experimental conditions, where three operating factors, i.e., coal flow rate, coal particle diameter, and steam-to-oxygen ratio, were systematically varied to understand their effect on the syngas composition. Bayesian UQ analysis was this time performed on the numerical results for comparison purposes. This is part of ongoing research efforts to explore the applicability of advanced UQ methods and processes such as Bayesian methods for large-scale complex multiphase flow simulations. As part of Bayesian UQ analysis, a global sensitivity analysis was performed based on the simulation results, which shows that the predicted syngas composition is strongly affected not only by the steam-to-oxygen ratio (which was observed in experiments as well) but also by variation in the coal flow rate and particle diameter (which was not observed in experiments). The carbon monoxide mole fraction is underpredicted at lower steam-to-oxygen ratios and overpredicted at higher steam-to-oxygen ratios. The opposite trend is observed for the carbon dioxide mole fraction. These discrepancies are attributed to either excessive segregation of the phases that leads to the fuel-rich or -lean regions or alternatively the selection of reaction models, where different reaction models and kinetics can lead to different syngas compositions throughout the gasifier.","American Chemical Society (ACS)","","Lawrence Berkeley National Lab.

Lett. 144 (2014) 1127-1133]. For an iron catalyst, lower HCl concentrations (< 2.0 ppmw of HCl)) in syngas did not significantly affect the activity, whereas rapid deactivation occurred at higher concentrations (~20 ppmw). With cobalt catalysts, even low concentrations of HCl (100 ppbw) caused catalyst deactivation, and the deactivation rate increased with increasing HCl concentration in the syngas. The deactivation of the catalysts is explained by the chloride being adsorbed on the catalyst surface to (1) block the active sites and/or (2) electronically modify the sites. In this study, XANES spectroscopy was employed to investigate HCl poisoning mechanism on the iron and cobalt catalysts. Cl K-edge normalized XANES results indicate that Cl is indeed present on the catalyst following HCl poisoning and exhibits a structure similar to the family of compounds MCl; two main peaks are formed, with the second peak consisting of a main peak and a higher energy shoulder. At the Co K and Fe K edges, the white line was observed to be slightly increased relative to the same catalyst under clean conditions. There is then the additional possibility that Cl adsorption may act in part to intercept electron density from the FT metallic function (e.g.,cobalt or iron carbide). If so, this would result in less back-donation and therefore hinder the scission of molecules such as CO.","Springer","","Brookhaven National Lab.

The addition of ammonia (10 ppmv NH<sub>3</sub>) caused a significant deactivation for all supported cobalt catalysts, but the rate of deactivation was higher for the silica-supported catalysts relative to the alumina and titania-supported catalysts used in this work. Ammonia addition had a positive effect on product selectivity (i.e., lower light gas products and higher C<sub>5</sub>+) for alumina and titania-supported catalysts compared to ammonia free conditions, whereas, the addition of ammonia increased lighter hydrocarbon (C<sub>1</sub>-C<sub>4</sub>) products and decreased higher hydrocarbon (C<sub>5</sub>+) selectivity compared to ammonia-free synthesis conditions for the silica-supported catalyst. For alumina and titania-supported catalysts, the activity almost recovered with mild in-situ hydrogen treatment of the ammonia exposed catalysts. For the silica-supported catalyst, the loss of activity is somewhat irreversible (i.e., cannot be regained after the mild hydrogen treatment). Addition of ammonia led to a significant loss in BET surface area and changes in pore diameter (consistent with pore collapse of a fraction of pores into the microporous range as described in the literature), as well as formation of catalytically inactive cobalt support compounds for the silica-supported catalyst. On the other hand, the pore characteristics of alumina and titania-supported catalysts were not significantly changed. In conclusion, XANES results of the ammonia exposed silica-supported catalysts further confirm the formation of cobalt-support compounds (cobalt silicates).","Elsevier","","Brookhaven National Lab.

M.; Haber, J. A.; Gregoire, J. M.","10 SYNTHETIC FUELS; 37 INORGANIC, ORGANIC, PHYSICAL, AND ANALYTICAL CHEMISTRY","The development of an efficient photoanode remains the primary materials challenge in the establishment of a scalable technology for solar water splitting. The typical photoanode architecture consists of a semiconductor light absorber coated with a metal oxide that serves a combination of functions, including corrosion protection, electrocatalysis, light trapping, hole transport, and elimination of deleterious recombination sites. To date, such coatings have been mostly limited to simple materials such as TiO<sub>2</sub> and Co-Pi, with extensive experimental and theoretical effort required to provide an understanding of the physics and chemistry of the semiconductor-coating interface. In order to provide a more efficient exploration of metal oxide coatings for a given light absorber, we introduce a high throughput methodology wherein a uniform BiVO<sub>4</sub> thin film is coated with 858 unique metal oxides covering a range of metal oxide loadings and the full Ni–La–Co–Ce oxide quaternary composition space. Photoelectrochemical characterization of each photoanode reveals that approximately one third of the coatings lower the photoanode performance while select combinations of metal oxide composition and loading provide up to a 14-fold increase in the maximum photoelectrochemical power generation for oxygen evolution in pH 13 electrolyte. Particular Ce-rich coatings also exhibit an anti-reflection effect that further amplifies the performance, yielding a 20-fold enhancement in power conversion efficiency compared to bare BiVO<sub>4</sub>. By use of in situ optical spectroscopy and comparisons between the metal oxide coatings and their extrinsic optical and electrocatalytic properties, we present a suite of data-driven discoveries, including composition regions which form optimal interfaces with BiVO<sub>4</sub> and photoanodes that are suitable for integration with a photocathode due to their excellent power conversion and solar transmission efficiencies. The high throughput experimentation and informatics provides a powerful platform for both identifying the pertinent interfaces for further study and discovering high performance photoanodes for incorporation into efficient water splitting devices.","Royal Society of Chemistry","","California Institute of Technology (CalTech), Pasadena, CA (United States)","USDOE Office of Science (SC), Basic Energy Sciences (BES)","","United States","2015-12-09T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: Energy & Environmental Science; Journal Volume: 9; Journal Issue: 2","","Medium: ED; Size: p. 565-580","","","SC0004993","Journal ID: ISSN 1754-5692; EESNBY","10.1039/C5EE03488D","","2021-07-27T00:00:00Z","1468642","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/1468642","https://www.osti.gov/servlets/purl/1468642","Energy & Environmental Science","2","9"

However, the chemical complexity of many residues currently prevents efficient conversion into lipids, creating a high demand for strains with the ability to utilize all energy-rich components of agricultural residues. Here, we present results of genome and transcriptome analyses of Trichosporon oleaginosus. This oil-accumulating yeast is able to grow on a wide variety of substrates, including pentoses and N-acetylglucosamine, making it an interesting candidate for biotechnological applications. Transcriptomics shows specific changes in gene expression patterns under lipid-accumulating conditions. Furthermore, gene content and expression analyses indicate that T. oleaginosus is well-adapted for the utilization of chitin-rich biomass. We also focused on the T. oleaginosus mating type, because this species is a member of the Tremellomycetes, a group that has been intensively analyzed as a model for the evolution of sexual development, the best-studied member being Cryptococcus neoformans. The structure of the T. oleaginosus mating-type regions differs significantly from that of other Tremellomycetes and reveals a new evolutionary trajectory paradigm. Comparative analysis shows that recruitment of developmental genes to the ancestral tetrapolar mating-type loci occurred independently in the Trichosporon and Cryptococcus lineages, supporting the hypothesis of a trend toward larger mating-type regions in fungi. IMPORTANCE: Finite fossil fuel resources pose sustainability challenges to society and industry. Microbial oils are a sustainable feedstock for biofuel and chemical production that does not compete with food production. We describe genome and transcriptome analyses of the oleaginous yeast Trichosporon oleaginosus, which can accumulate up to 70% of its dry weight as lipids. In contrast to conventional yeasts, this organism not only shows an absence of diauxic effect while fermenting hexoses and pentoses but also effectively utilizes xylose and N-acetylglucosamine, which are building blocks of lignocellulose and chitin, respectively. Transcriptome analysis revealed metabolic networks that govern conversion of xylose or N-acetylglucosamine as well as lipid accumulation. These data form the basis for a targeted strain optimization strategy. Furthermore, analysis of the mating type of T. oleaginosus supports the hypothesis of a trend toward larger mating-type regions in fungi, similar to the evolution of sex chromosomes in animals and plants.","American Society for Microbiology (ASM)","","Lawrence Berkeley National Lab.

"Effect of fuel composition and differential diffusion on flame stabilization in reacting syngas jets in turbulent cross-flow","Minamoto, Yuki; Kolla, Hemanth; Grout, Ray W.; Gruber, Andrea; Chen, Jacqueline H.","10 SYNTHETIC FUELS; flame stabilization; transverse jet; syngas combustion; direct numerical simulation","Here, three-dimensional direct numerical simulation results of a transverse syngas fuel jet in turbulent cross-flow of air are analyzed to study the influence of varying volume fractions of CO relative to H<sub>2</sub> in the fuel composition on the near field flame stabilization. The mean flame stabilizes at a similar location for CO-lean and CO-rich cases despite the trend suggested by their laminar flame speed, which is higher for the CO-lean condition. To identify local mixtures having favorable mixture conditions for flame stabilization, explosive zones are defined using a chemical explosive mode timescale. The explosive zones related to flame stabilization are located in relatively low velocity regions. The explosive zones are characterized by excess hydrogen transported solely by differential diffusion, in the absence of intense turbulent mixing or scalar dissipation rate. The conditional averages show that differential diffusion is negatively correlated with turbulent mixing. Moreover, the local turbulent Reynolds number is insufficient to estimate the magnitude of the differential diffusion effect. Alternatively, the Karlovitz number provides a better indicator of the importance of differential diffusion. A comparison of the variations of differential diffusion, turbulent mixing, heat release rate and probability of encountering explosive zones demonstrates that differential diffusion predominantly plays an important role for mixture preparation and initiation of chemical reactions, closely followed by intense chemical reactions sustained by sufficient downstream turbulent mixing. The mechanism by which differential diffusion contributes to mixture preparation is investigated using the Takeno Flame Index. The mean Flame Index, based on the combined fuel species, shows that the overall extent of premixing is not intense in the upstream regions. However, the Flame Index computed based on individual contribution of H<sub>2</sub> or CO species reveals that hydrogen contributes significantly to premixing, particularly in explosive zones in the upstream leeward region, i.e. at the preferred flame stabilization location. Therefore, a small amount of H<sub>2</sub> diffuses much faster than CO, creating relatively homogeneous mixture pockets depending on the competition with turbulent mixing. These pockets, together with high H<sub>2</sub> reactivity, contribute to stabilizing the flame at a consistent location regardless of the CO concentration in the fuel for the present range of DNS conditions.","Elsevier","","Oak Ridge National Lab.

Specific PWR lattice designs with FCM fuel have been developed that are expected to achieve higher specific burnup levels in the fuel while also increasing the tolerance to reactor accidents. The SCALE software system was the primary analysis tool used to model the lattice designs. A parametric study was performed by varying tristructural isotropic particle design features (e.g., kernel diameter, coating layer thicknesses, and packing fraction) to understand the impact on reactivity and resulting operating cycle length. Moreover, to match the lifetime of an 18-month PWR cycle, the FCM particle fuel design required roughly 10% additional fissile material at beginning of life compared with that of a standard uranium dioxide (UO<sub>2</sub>) rod. Uranium mononitride proved to be a favorable fuel for the fuel kernel due to its higher heavy metal loading density compared with UO<sub>2</sub>. The FCM fuel designs evaluated maintain acceptable neutronics design features for fuel lifetime, lattice peaking factors, and nonproliferation figure of merit.","Taylor & Francis - formerly American Nuclear Society (ANS)","","Oak Ridge National Lab.

In particular, water splitting near pH 0 is attractive due to the availability of high theoretical efficiency, high performance hydrogen evolution catalysts, and robust ion exchange membranes. The lack of a stable, earth-abundant oxygen evolution catalyst inhibits deployment of this technology, and development of such a material is hampered by the strong anti-correlation between electrochemical stability and catalytic activity of non-precious metal oxides. High-throughput screening of mixed metal oxides offers a promising route to the identification of new stable catalysts and requires careful design of experiments to combine the concepts of rapid experimentation and long-term stability. By combining serial and parallel measurement techniques, we have created a high-throughput platform to assess the catalytic activity of material libraries in the as-prepared state and after 2 h of operation. By screening the entire (Mn–Co–Ta–Sb)O<sub>x</sub> composition space, we observe that the compositions with highest initial activity comprised cobalt and manganese oxides, but combinations with antimony and tantalum offer improved stability.

From these, and the chemical equilibria within the system, the impact on electrochemically generated gases is presented. Comparing the predicted and measured faradaic efficiency of electrode processes with the expected efficiency from experimental data indicates an offset between the two exists. Methods to minimize and account for the discrepancy are presented with the goal of being able to discern, in a real time manner, degradation of electrode performance. Comparison of the model to experimental data shows a strong correlation between the two with slight variation in experimental data which is attributed to reversible system dynamics such as wetting of the gas diffusion electrode used as the cell cathode.","Springer","","Idaho National Lab.

A Novel Process Combining CO Methanation, Water-Gas Shift, and CO<sub>2</sub> Capture","Lebarbier, Vanessa M.C.; Dagle, Robert A.; Kovarik, Libor; Albrecht, Karl O.; Li, Xiaohong S.; Li, Liyu; Taylor, Charles E.; Bao, Xinhe; Wang, Yong","10 SYNTHETIC FUELS; CO methanation CO2 capture sorbent; Environmental Molecular Sciences Laboratory","Synthetic natural gas (SNG) production from syngas is under investigation again due to the desire for less dependency from imports and the opportunity for increasing coal utilization and reducing green house gas emission. CO methanation is highly exothermic and substantial heat is liberated which can lead to process thermal imbalance and deactivation of the catalyst. As a result, conversion per pass is limited and substantial syngas recycle is employed in conventional processes. Furthermore, the conversion of syngas to SNG is typically performed at moderate temperatures (275 to 325°C) to ensure high CH<sub>4</sub> yields since this reaction is thermodynamically limited. In this study, the effectiveness of a novel integrated process for the SNG production from syngas at high temperature (i.e. 600°C) was investigated. This integrated process consists of combining a CO methanation nickel-based catalyst with a high temperature CO<sub>2</sub> capture sorbent in a single reactor. Integration with CO<sub>2</sub> separation eliminates the reverse-water-gas shift and the requirement for a separate water-gas shift (WGS) unit. Easing of thermodynamic constraint offers the opportunity of enhancing yield to CH<sub>4</sub> at higher operating temperature (500-700ºC) which also favors methanation kinetics and improves the overall process efficiency due to exploitation of reaction heat at higher temperatures. Furthermore, simultaneous CO<sub>2</sub> capture eliminates green house gas emission. In this work, sorption-enhanced CO methanation was demonstrated using a mixture of a 68% CaO/32% MgAl<sub>2</sub>O<sub>4</sub> sorbent and a CO methanation catalyst (Ni/Al<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub>, Ni/MgAl<sub>2</sub>O<sub>4</sub>, or Ni/SiC) utilizing a syngas ratio (H<sub>2</sub>/CO) of 1, gas-hour-space velocity (GHSV) of 22 000 hr<sup>-1</sup>, pressure of 1 bar and a temperature of 600°C. These conditions resulted in ~90% yield to methane, which was maintained until the sorbent became saturated with CO<sub>2</sub>. By contrast, without the use of sorbent, equilibrium yield to methane is only 22%. Cyclic stability of the methanation catalyst and durability of the sorbent were also studied in the multiple carbonation-decarbonation cycle studies proving the potential of this integrated process in a practical application.","Elsevier","","Pacific Northwest National Lab.

ASTM D1655 Standard Specification for Aviation Turbine Fuels and MOD Defence Standard 91-91 are the guiding specifications for this fuel throughout most of the world. Both of these documents rely heavily on the vast amount of experience in production and use of turbine engine fuels from conventional sources, such as crude oil, natural gas condensates, heavy oil, shale oil, and oil sands. Turbine engine fuel derived from these resources and meeting the above specifications has properties that are generally considered acceptable for fuels to be used in turbine engines. Alternative and synthetic fuel components are approved for use to blend with conventional turbine engine fuels after considerable testing. ASTM has established a specification for fuels containing synthesized hydrocarbons under D7566, and the MOD has included additional requirements for fuels containing synthetic components under Annex D of DS91-91. New turbine engine fuel additives and blend components need to be evaluated using ASTM D4054, Standard Practice for Qualification and Approval of New Aviation Turbine Fuels and Fuel Additives. This paper discusses these specifications and testing requirements in light of recent literature claiming that some biomass-derived blend components, which have been used to blend in conventional aviation fuel, meet the requirements for aviation turbine fuels as specified by ASTM and the MOD. The &#x27;Table 1&#x27; requirements listed in both D1655 and DS91-91 are predicated on the assumption that the feedstocks used to make fuels meeting these requirements are from approved sources. Recent papers have implied that commercial jet fuel can be blended with renewable components that are not hydrocarbons (such as fatty acid methyl esters). These are not allowed blend components for turbine engine fuels as discussed in this paper.","","","","","","United States","2013-01-15T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: Energy and Fuels; Journal Volume: 27","","Medium: X","","","","Journal ID: ISSN 0887-0624; CODEN: ENFUEM; TRN: US13OA001","10.1021/ef301888b","","2013-07-08T00:00:00Z","1082312","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/1082312","","Energy and Fuels","","27"

Solid oxide electrolysis cells (SOECs) are able to utilize high temperature heat and electric power from advanced high-temperature nuclear reactors or renewable sources to generate carbon-free hydrogen at large scale. However, long term durability of SOECs needs to be improved significantly before commercialization of this technology can be realized. A degradation rate of 1%/khr or lower is proposed as a threshold value for commercialization of this technology. Solid oxide electrolysis stack tests have been conducted at Idaho National Laboratory to demonstrate recent improvements in long-term durability of SOECs. Electrolyte-supported and electrode-supported SOEC stacks were provided by Ceramatec Inc. and Materials and Systems Research Inc. (MSRI), respectively, for these tests. Long-term durability tests were generally operated for a duration of 1000 hours or more. Stack tests based on technologies developed at Ceramatec and MSRI have shown significant improvement in durability in the electrolysis mode. Long-term degradation rates of 3.2%/khr and 4.6%/khr were observed for MSRI and Ceramatec stacks, espectively. One recent Ceramatec stack even showed negative degradation (performance improvement) over 1900 hours of operation. Optimization of electrode materials, interconnect coatings, and electrolyte-electrode interface microstructures contribute to better durability of SOEC stacks.","","","Idaho National Lab.

This difference permitted size control by regulation of the nucleation rate because low oxidation state metals ions nucleate quickly relative to high oxidation state ions. After immobilization of the Pd particles on silica by mild sonication, the catalysts were characterized by X-ray absorption spectroscopy and applied toward catalytic methanol decomposition. This reaction was determined as structure sensitive with the intrinsic activity (turnover frequency) increasing with increasing particle size. Moreover, observed catalytic deactivation was linked to product (carbon monoxide) poisoning. Co-feeding carbon dioxide caused the activity and the amount of deactivation to decrease substantially. A reaction mechanism based on the formation of the {pi}-bond between carbon and oxygen as the rate-limiting step is in agreement with antipathetic structure sensitivity and product poisoning by carbon monoxide.","","","Argonne National Lab.

"Theoretical study of syngas hydrogenation to methanol on the polar Zn-terminated ZnO(0001) surface","Zhao, Ya-Fan; Rousseau, Roger J.; Li, Jun; Mei, Donghai","10 SYNTHETIC FUELS; CARBONATES; FORMALDEHYDE; FORMATES; FUNCTIONALS; HYDROGENATION; METHANOL; SYNTHESIS; WATER; Environmental Molecular Sciences Laboratory","Methanol synthesis from syngas (CO/CO2/H2) hydrogenation on the perfect Zn–terminated polar ZnO(0001) surface have been investigated using periodic density functional theory calculations. Our results show that direct CO2 hydrogenation to methanol on the perfect ZnO(0001) surface is unlikely because in the presence of surface atomic H and O the highly stable formate (HCOO) and carbonate (CO3) readily produced from CO2 with low barriers 0.11 and 0.09 eV will eventually accumulate and block the active sites of the ZnO(0001) surface. In contrast, methanol synthesis from CO hydrogenation is thermodynamically and kinetically feasible on the perfect ZnO(0001) surface. CO can be consecutively hydrogenated into formyl (HCO), formaldehyde (H2CO), methoxy (H3CO) intermediates, leading to the final formation of methanol (H3COH). The reaction route via hydroxymethyl (H2COH) intermediate, a previously proposed species on the defected O–terminated ZnO( ) surface, is kinetically inhibited on the perfect ZnO(0001) surface. The rate-determining step in the consecutive CO hydrogenation route is the hydrogenation of H3CO to H3COH. We also note that this last hydrogenation step is pronouncedly facilitated in the presence of water by lowering the activation barrier from 1.02 to 0.55 eV.

"Preliminary Experimental Results of Integrated Gasification Fuel Cell Operation Using Hardware Simulation","Traverso, Alberto; Tucker, David; Haynes, Comas L.","30 DIRECT ENERGY CONVERSION; 10 SYNTHETIC FUELS; Flow (Dynamics), Temperature, Simulation, Hardware, Fuel cells, Gas turbines, Syngas, Fuel gasification","A newly developed integrated gasification fuel cell (IGFC) hybrid system concept has been tested using the Hybrid Performance (Hyper) project hardware-based simulation facility at the U.S. Department of Energy, National Energy Technology Laboratory. The cathode-loop hardware facility, previously connected to the real-time fuel cell model, was integrated with a real-time model of a gasifier of solid (biomass and fossil) fuel. The fuel cells are operated at the compressor delivery pressure, and they are fueled by an updraft atmospheric gasifier, through the syngas conditioning train for tar removal and syngas compression. The system was brought to steady state; then several perturbations in open loop (variable speed) and closed loop (constant speed) were performed in order to characterize the IGFC behavior. Coupled experiments and computations have shown the feasibility of relatively fast control of the plant as well as a possible mitigation strategy to reduce the thermal stress on the fuel cells as a consequence of load variation and change in gasifier operating conditions. Results also provided an insight into the different features of variable versus constant speed operation of the gas turbine section.","","","National Energy Technology Lab.

"Ethanol Distribution, Dispensing, and Use: Analysis of a Portion of the Biomass-to-Biofuels Supply Chain Using System Dynamics","Vimmerstedt, L J; Bush, B; Peterson, S","02 PETROLEUM; 09 BIOMASS FUELS; 10 SYNTHETIC FUELS; 14 SOLAR ENERGY; AVAILABILITY; BIOFUELS; BIOMASS; CHAINS; DISTRIBUTION; ETHANOL; ETHANOL FUELS; FUEL SYSTEMS; GASOLINE; MARKET; NATIONAL RENEWABLE ENERGY LABORATORY; PRICES; SECURITY; TARGETS; Energy Analysis","The Energy Independence and Security Act of 2007 targets use of 36 billion gallons of biofuels per year by 2022. Achieving this may require substantial changes to current transportation fuel systems for distribution, dispensing, and use in vehicles. The U.S. Department of Energy and the National Renewable Energy Laboratory designed a system dynamics approach to help focus government action by determining what supply chain changes would have the greatest potential to accelerate biofuels deployment. The National Renewable Energy Laboratory developed the Biomass Scenario Model, a system dynamics model which represents the primary system effects and dependencies in the biomass-to-biofuels supply chain. The model provides a framework for developing scenarios and conducting biofuels policy analysis. This paper focuses on the downstream portion of the supply chain-represented in the distribution logistics, dispensing station, and fuel utilization, and vehicle modules of the Biomass Scenario Model. This model initially focused on ethanol, but has since been expanded to include other biofuels. Some portions of this system are represented dynamically with major interactions and feedbacks, especially those related to a dispensing station owner's decision whether to offer ethanol fuel and a consumer's choice whether to purchase that fuel. Other portions of the system are modeled with little or no dynamics; the vehicle choices of consumers are represented as discrete scenarios. This paper explores conditions needed to sustain an ethanol fuel market and identifies implications of these findings for program and policy goals. A large, economically sustainable ethanol fuel market (or other biofuel market) requires low end-user fuel price relative to gasoline and sufficient producer payment, which are difficult to achieve simultaneously. Other requirements (different for ethanol vs. other biofuel markets) include the need for infrastructure for distribution and dispensing and widespread use of high ethanol blends in flexible-fuel vehicles.","","","National Renewable Energy Lab.

The vehicles ranged in model year from 1984 to 2007 and included one Flexible Fuel Vehicle (FFV). Emission and fuel consumption measurements were performed in duplicate or triplicate over the Federal Test Procedure (FTP) driving cycle using a chassis dynamometer for four fuels in each of seven vehicles. The test fuels included a CARB phase 2 certification fuel with 11% MTBE content, a CARB phase 3 certification fuel with a 5.7% ethanol content, and E10, E20, E50, and E85 fuels. In most cases, THC and NMHC emissions were lower with the ethanol blends, while the use of E85 resulted in increases of THC and NMHC for the FFV. CO emissions were lower with ethanol blends for all vehicles and significantly decreased for earlier model vehicles. Results for NOx emissions were mixed, with some older vehicles showing increases with increasing ethanol level, while other vehicles showed either no impact or a slight, but not statistically significant, decrease. CO2 emissions did not show any significant trends. Fuel economy showed decreasing trends with increasing ethanol content in later model vehicles. There was also a consistent trend of increasing acetaldehyde emissions with increasing ethanol level, but other carbonyls did not show strong trends. The use of E85 resulted in significantly higher formaldehyde and acetaldehyde emissions than the specification fuels or other ethanol blends. BTEX and 1,3-butadiene emissions were lower with ethanol blends compared to the CARB 2 fuel, and were almost undetectable from the E85 fuel. The largest contribution to total carbonyls and other toxics was during the cold-start phase of FTP.","","","Pacific Northwest National Lab.

Using a combination of experimental evidence from bulk-, surface-sensitive and imaging methods collected on real high-performance catalytic systems in combination with DFT calculations.

The results are compared with those for the same system in methanol and acetonitrile solution. Electron-transfer rates were measured using time-resolved fluorescence quenching for the donor-bridge-acceptor system comprising a 1-N,1-N-dimethylbenzene-1,4-diamine donor, a proline bridge, and a coumarin 343 acceptor. The photoinduced electron-transfer processes are in the inverted regime (-{Delta}G &gt; {lambda}) in all four solvents, with driving forces of -1.6 to -1.9 eV and estimated reorganization energies of about 1.0 eV. The observed electron-transfer kinetics have broadly distributed rates that are generally slower in the ionic liquids compared to the neutral solvents, which also have narrower rate distributions. To describe the broad distributions of electron-transfer kinetics, we use two different models: a distribution of exponential lifetimes and a discrete sum of exponential lifetimes. Analysis of the donor-acceptor electronic coupling shows that for ionic liquids this intramolecular electron-transfer reaction should be treated using a solvent-controlled electron-transfer model.","","","Brookhaven National Lab.

Our value fits on the Polanyi-type, rate-enthalpy linear correlation ln(k/n) = (0.80 {+-} 0.05){Delta}H + (3.2 {+-} 0.8) that is found for the analogous reactions of other aqueous aliphatic alcohols with n equivalent abstractable H atoms. The existence of such a correlation and its large slope are interpreted as an indication of the mechanistic similarity of the H atom abstraction from {alpha}- and {beta}-carbon atoms in alcohols occurring through the late, product-like transition state. tert-Butyl alcohol is commonly contaminated by much more reactive secondary and primary alcohols (2-propanol, 2-butanol, ethanol, and methanol), whose content can be sufficient for nearly quantitative scavenging of the H atoms, skewing the H atom reactivity pattern, and explaining the disparity of the literature data on the H + (CH{sub 3}){sub 3}COH rate constant. The ubiquitous use of tert-butyl alcohol in pulse radiolysis for investigating H atom reactivity and the results of this work suggest that many other previously reported rate constants for the H atom, particularly the smaller ones, may be in jeopardy.","","","Brookhaven National Lab.

Previous biochemical and structural studies of pMMO have focused on preparations from Methylococcus capsulatus (Bath) and Methylosinus trichosporium OB3b. A pMMO from a third organism, Methylocystis species strain M, has been isolated and characterized. Both membrane-bound and solubilized Methylocystis sp. strain M pMMO contain {approx}2 copper ions per 100 kDa protomer and exhibit copper-dependent propylene epoxidation activity. Spectroscopic data indicate that Methylocystis sp. strain M pMMO contains a mixture of Cu{sup I} and Cu{sup II}, of which the latter exhibits two distinct type 2 Cu{sup II} electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR) signals. Extended X-ray absorption fine structure (EXAFS) data are best fit with a mixture of Cu-O/N and Cu-Cu ligand environments with a Cu-Cu interaction at 2.52-2.64 {angstrom}. The crystal structure of Methylocystis sp. strain M pMMO was determined to 2.68 {angstrom} resolution and is the best quality pMMO structure obtained to date. It provides a revised model for the pmoA and pmoC subunits and has led to an improved model of M. capsulatus (Bath) pMMO. In these new structures, the intramembrane zinc/copper binding site has a different coordination environment from that in previous models.","","","Argonne National Lab.

Vehicle fuel is the only current energy use large enough to absorb all the energy capacity that might be diverted from the power industry, and its ease of storage obviates problems with discontinuous synfuel production. The potential benefits and challenges of synfuels integration are illustrated by the production of methanol from natural gas (as a source of carbon) using steam from a light water nuclear power reactor which is assumed to be available in accord with a year's worth of power demand data. Methanol's synthesis process is easily adapted to using 300 C heat from a light water reactor and this simple compound can be further processed into gasoline, biodiesel, or dimethyl ether, fuels which can be used with the current vehicle fleet. A supplemental feed to the methanol process of natural gas (for energy) allows operation at constant full rate when the nuclear heat is being used to produce electrical power. The higher capital costs of such a system are offset by a lower cost of heat and power production from a large base load type of plant and by reduced costs associated with much lower CO2 emissions. Other less tangible economic benefits of this and similar hybrid systems include better use of natural resource for fuels and greater energy services security from the domestic production of vehicle fuel.","","","Idaho National Lab.

"A Theoretical Study of Methanol Synthesis from CO(2) Hydrogenation on Metal-doped Cu(111) Surfaces","Liu, P; Yang, Y; White, M G","10 SYNTHETIC FUELS; 30 DIRECT ENERGY CONVERSION; BINDING ENERGY; CATALYSTS; DESORPTION; FORMATES; FUNCTIONALS; HYDROGENATION; KINETICS; METHANOL; POISONING; PRODUCTION; SYNTHESIS; WATER GAS; density functional theory; catalysis; methanol synthesis; functional nanomaterials","Density functional theory (DFT) calculations and Kinetic Monte Carlo (KMC) simulations were employed to investigate the methanol synthesis reaction from CO{sub 2} hydrogenation (CO{sub 2} + 3H{sub 2} {yields} CH{sub 3}OH + H{sub 2}O) on metal-doped Cu(111) surfaces. Both the formate pathway and the reverse water-gas shift (RWGS) reaction followed by a CO hydrogenation pathway (RWGS + CO-Hydro) were considered in the study. Our calculations showed that the overall methanol yield increased in the sequence: Au/Cu(111) &lt; Cu(111) &lt; Pd/Cu(111) &lt; Rh/Cu(111) &lt; Pt/Cu(111) &lt; Ni/Cu(111). On Au/Cu(111) and Cu(111), the formate pathway dominates the methanol production. Doping Au does not help the methanol synthesis on Cu(111). Pd, Rh, Pt, and Ni are able to promote the methanol production on Cu(111), where the conversion via the RWGS + CO-Hydro pathway is much faster than that via the formate pathway. Further kinetic analysis revealed that the methanol yield on Cu(111) was controlled by three factors: the dioxomethylene hydrogenation barrier, the CO binding energy, and the CO hydrogenation barrier. Accordingly, two possible descriptors are identified which can be used to describe the catalytic activity of Cu-based catalysts toward methanol synthesis. One is the activation barrier of dioxomethylene hydrogenation, and the other is the CO binding energy. An ideal Cu-based catalyst for the methanol synthesis via CO{sub 2} hydrogenation should be able to hydrogenate dioxomethylene easily and bond CO moderately, being strong enough to favor the desired CO hydrogenation rather than CO desorption but weak enough to prevent CO poisoning. In this way, the methanol production via both the formate and the RWGS + CO-Hydro pathways can be facilitated.","","","Brookhaven National Lab. (BNL), Upton, NY (United States).

External functionalization with tBu groups led to enhanced solubility of the cages in aqueous methanol solutions, thereby allowing for their thorough characterization by multinuclear ({sup 1}H, {sup 13}C, {sup 77}Se) and diffusion NMR spectroscopies. Additional experimental characterization by electrospray ionization mass spectrometry, UV-vis spectroscopy, and single-crystal X-ray diffraction, as well as theoretical calculations, led to a detailed understanding of the cage structures, self-assembly, and anion encapsulation. We found that the cage self-assembly is templated by EO{sub 4}{sup -} oxoanions (n {ge} 2), and upon removal of the templating anion the tetrahedral M{sub 4}L{sub 6} cages rearrange into different coordination assemblies.

"Transported PDF Modeling of Nonpremixed Turbulent CO/H-2/N-2 Jet Flames","Zhao, xinyu; Haworth, D. C.; Huckaby, E. David","10 SYNTHETIC FUELS; 42 ENGINEERING; Nonpremixed turbulent flames, Probability density function method, Syngas flames","Turbulent CO/H{sub 2}/N{sub 2} (“syngas”) flames are simulated using a transported composition probability density function (PDF) method. A consistent hybrid Lagrangian particle/Eulerian mesh algorithm is used to solve the modeled PDF transport equation. The model includes standard k–ϵ turbulence, gradient transport for scalars, and Euclidean minimum spanning tree (EMST) mixing. Sensitivities of model results to variations in the turbulence model, the treatment of radiation heat transfer, the choice of chemical mechanism, and the PDF mixing model are explored. A baseline model reproduces the measured mean and rms temperature, major species, and minor species profiles reasonably well, and captures the scaling that is observed in the experiments. Both our results and the literature suggest that further improvements can be realized with adjustments in the turbulence model, the radiation heat transfer model, and the chemical mechanism. Although radiation effects are relatively small in these flames, consideration of radiation is important for accurate NO prediction. Chemical mechanisms that have been developed specifically for fuels with high concentrations of CO and H{sub 2} perform better than a methane mechanism that was not designed for this purpose. It is important to account explicitly for turbulence–chemistry interactions, although the details of the mixing model do not make a large difference in the results, within reasonable limits.","","","National Energy Technology Lab.

Compound 1 is monometallic, whereas EXAFS data suggest that 2 is a mixture of mono- and bimetallic species. The archetypical [Fe{sup III}(L{sup NN'O}){sub 2}]{sup +} complexes 3-9 have been isolated and characterized in order to understand the geometric, electronic, and redox properties of the amphiphiles. Preference for a monometallic or bimetallic nuclearity is dependent on (i) the nature of the solvent used for synthesis and (ii) the type of the substituent in the phenol moiety. In methanol, the tert-butyl-, methoxy-, and chloro-substituted 3, 4, and 5 are monometallic species, whereas the bromo- and iodo-substituted 6 and 7 form bimetallic complexes taking advantage of stabilizing methoxo bridges generated by solvent deprotonation. In dichloromethane, the bromo- and iodo-substituted 8 and 9 are monometallic species; however, these species favor meridional coordination in opposition to the facial coordination observed for the tert-butyl- and methoxy-substituted compounds. Molecular structures for species 5, 7, 8, and 9 have been solved by X-ray diffraction. Furthermore, the electronic spectrum of the amphiphile 1 was expected to be similar to those of facial/cis archetypes with similar substituents, but close resemblance was observed with the profile for those meridional/cis species, suggesting a similar coordination mode. This trend is discussed based on DFT calculations, where preference for the meridional/cis coordination mode appears related to the presence of tertiary amine nitrogen on the ligand, as when a long alkyl chain is attached to the [NN'O] headgroup.","","","Brookhaven National Lab.

All of the alcohols adsorb at low temperature by forming alkoxy and hydroxyl species on the surface. On fully oxidized CeO{sub 2}(111), recombination occurs between some of the alkoxys and hydroxyls, resulting in alcohol desorption near 220 K. At the same temperature, some of the surface hydroxyls disproportionate to produce water and the loss of lattice O. The remaining alkoxys react above 550 K. The primary alcohols favor dehydrogenation products (aldehydes). There is a net loss of O from the system, resulting in a reduction of the ceria. The secondary alcohol, 2-propanol, undergoes primarily dehydration, producing propene with no net change in the cerium oxidation state. Reduced CeO{sub x}(111) competes with the gaseous products for available O. Little or no water is produced. The reaction selectivity for the C{sub 2} and C{sub 3} alcohols shifts toward favoring dehydration products. The loss of O from the alcohols leads to oxidation of the reduced ceria. Compared with the oxidized surface, the alkene desorption shifts to lower temperature, whereas the aldehyde desorption shifts to higher temperature. This indicates that, on the reduced surface, it is easier to break the C-O bond but more difficult to break the O-substrate bond.","","","Brookhaven National Lab.

Instead, the addition of 1 equiv of peracid resulted in 50% consumption of 1. The addition of a second equivalent of peracid resulted in the complete consumption of 1 and the formation of a new species 3, as monitored by UV-vis, ESI-MS, and Moessbauer spectroscopies.

"Water-Gas Shift and CO Methanation Reactions over Ni-CeO2(111) Catalysts","Senanayake, S; Evans, J; Agnoli, S; Barrio, L; Chen, T; Hrbek, J; Rodriguez, J","03 NATURAL GAS; 10 SYNTHETIC FUELS; ABSORPTION; ADSORPTION; ATOMS; CARBON MONOXIDE; CARBONATES; CATALYSTS; CATIONS; CHEMISORPTION; FERMI LEVEL; FINE STRUCTURE; HEATING; METHANATION; METHANE; NICKEL; OXIDES; PHOTOEMISSION; PRODUCTION; SUBSTRATES; WATER; WATER GAS","X-ray and ultraviolet photoelectron spectroscopies were used to study the interaction of Ni atoms with CeO{sub 2}(111) surfaces. Upon adsorption on CeO{sub 2}(111) at 300 K, nickel remains in a metallic state. Heating to elevated temperatures (500-800 K) leads to partial reduction of the ceria substrate with the formation of Ni{sup 2+} species that exists as NiO and/or Ce{sub 1-x}Ni{sub x}O{sub 2-y}. Interactions of nickel with the oxide substrate significantly reduce the density of occupied Ni 3d states near the Fermi level. The results of core-level photoemission and near-edge X-ray absorption fine structure point to weakly bound CO species on CeO{sub 2}(111) which are clearly distinguishable from the formation of chemisorbed carbonates. In the presence of Ni, a stronger interaction is observed with chemisorption of CO on the admetal. When the Ni is in contact with Ce{sup +3} cations, CO dissociates on the surface at 300 K forming NiC{sub x} compounds that may be involved in the formation of CH{sub 4} at higher temperatures. At medium and large Ni coverages (&gt;0.3 ML), the Ni/CeO{sub 2}(111) surfaces are able to catalyze the production of methane from CO and H{sub 2}, with an activity slightly higher than that of Ni(100) or Ni(111). On the other hand, at small coverages of Ni (&lt;0.3 ML), the Ni/CeO{sub 2}(111) surfaces exhibit a very low activity for CO methanation but are very good catalysts for the water-gas shift reaction.","","","Brookhaven National Lab.

TMP binds to Fe3+ sites on the clean α-Fe2O3(012) surface through lone pairs on the P=O oxygen atom. A small portion of adsorbed TMP desorbs without decomposition, however, the majority of adsorbed TMP decomposes in a two step process on the clean surface. The first step, occurring at or below room temperature (RT), likely involves displacement or substitution of one –OCH3 group to form surface methoxy groups and adsorbed dimethyl phosphate (DMP). In the second step, DMP decomposes above 500 K to a 1:1 ratio of gaseous methanol and formaldehyde with phosphate left on the surface. Identification of these steps was confirmed using the chemistry of methanol on the clean surface. Coadsorption of TMP and water led to a small degree of hydrolysis between these two molecules in the multilayer, but no significant change in the chemistry on the surface.

The strength of its complexes with trivalent americium (Am3+) and neodymium (Nd3+) in anhydrous methanol has been evaluated using spectrophotometric techniques. The purpose of this investigation is to assess this ligand (as representative of a class of similarly structured species) as a possible model compound for the challenging separation of trivalent actinides from lanthanides. This separation, important in the development of advanced nuclear fuel cycles, is best achieved through the agency of multidentate chelating agents containing some number of nitrogen or sulfur donor groups. To evaluate the relative strength of the bidentate complexes, the derived constants are compared to those of the same metal ions with 2,2*-bipyridyl (bipy), 1,10-phenanthroline (phen), and 2-pyridin-2-yl-1H-benzimidazole (PBIm). At issue is the relative affinity of the triazole moiety for trivalent f element ions. For all ligands, the derived stability constants are higher for Am3+ than Nd3+. In the case of Am3+ complexes with phen and PBIm, the presence of 1:2 (AmL2) species is indicated. Possible separations are suggested based on the relative stability and stoichiometry of the Am3+ and Nd3+ complexes. It can be noted that the 1,2,3-triazolyl group imparts a potentially useful selectivity for trivalent actinides (An(III)) over trivalent lanthanides (Ln(III)), though the attainment of higher complex stoichiometries in actinide compared with lanthanide complexes may be an important driver for developing successful separations.","","","Pacific Northwest National Lab.

The performance of these particles for high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) was assayed before and after this chemistry with the following analytes: benzene, toluene, ethyl benzene, n-propyl benzene, n-butyl benzene, p-xylene, phenol, 4-methylphenol, phenetole, 3,5-xylenol, and anisole. After the first functionalization/passivation, the retention factors, k, of these compounds decreased by about 5% and the number of theoretical plates (N) increased by ca. 15%. These values of k then remained roughly constant after a second functionalization/ passivation but a further increase in N was noticed. In addition, after each of the reactions, the peak asymmetries decreased by ca. 15%, for a total of ca. 30%. The columns were then subjected twice to methanol at 100 C for 5 h at 1 mL/min. After these stability tests, the values of k remained roughly constant, the number of plates increased, which is favorable, and the asymmetries rose and then declined, where they remained below the initial values for the unfunctionalized columns. Functionalized and unfunctionalized particles were characterized by scanning electron microscopy and BET measurements, which showed no difference between the functionalized and unfunctionalized materials, and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy and time-of-flight secondary ion mass spectrometry (ToF-SIMS), where ToF-SIMS suggested some chemical differences between the functionalized and unfunctionalized materials. In particular ToF-SIMS suggested that the expected five-carbon fragments from DTAP exist at higher concentrations on DTAP-functionalized PGC. First principle calculations on model graphitic surfaces suggest that the first addition of a DTAP radical to the surface proceeds in an approximately isothermal or slightly favorable fashion, but that subsequent DTAP additions are then increasingly thermodynamically favorable. Thus, this analysis suggests that the direct functionalization/passivation of PGC with DTAP is plausible. Chemometric analyses of the chromatographic and ToF-SIMS data are also presented.","","","Pacific Northwest National Lab. (PNNL), Richland, WA (United States). Environmental Molecular Sciences Lab.

Past observations have provided evidence that TCE at TAN is being transformed by biological natural attenuation that may be primarily due to co-metabolism in aerobic portions of the plume by methanotrophs. TCE co-metabolism by methanotrophs is the result of the broad substrate specificity of microbial methane monooxygenase which permits non-specific oxidation of TCE in addition to the primary substrate, methane. Arrays of experimental approaches have been utilized to understand the biogeochemical processes driving intrinsic TCE co-metabolism at TAN. In this study, aerobic methanotrophs were enumerated by qPCR using primers targeting conserved regions of the genes pmoA and mmoX encoding subunits of the particulate MMO (pMMO) and soluble MMO (sMMO) enzymes, respectively, as well as the gene mxa encoding the downstream enzyme methanol dehydrogenase. Identification of proteins in planktonic and biofilm samples from TAN was determined using reverse phase ultraperformance liquid chromatography (UPLC) coupled with a quadrupole-time-of-flight (QToF) mass spectrometer to separate and sequence peptides from trypsin digests of the protein extracts. Detection of MMO in unenriched water samples from TAN provides direct evidence of intrinsic methane oxidation and TCE co-metabolic potential of the indigenous microbial population. Mass spectrometry is also well suited for distinguishing which form of MMO is expressed in situ either soluble or particulate. Using this method, pMMO proteins were found to be abundant in samples collected from wells within and adjacent to the TCE plume at TAN.","","","Idaho National Lab.

The simulations indicate that the BLYP-D2 description underpredicts the saturated vapor densities and overpredicts the saturated liquid densities and critical and boiling temperatures for both compounds. Although the deviations are quite large, these results present a significant improvement over the BLYP functional without the correction term which misses the experimental results by a larger extent in the opposite direction.

Before poisoning, a mixture of CO and H2 (syn-gas) was produced. After exposure to Na2S at open circuit potential (OCP) the overpotential for H2 evolution decreased resulting in a significant decrease in the Faradaic efficiency for CO. It was found that poisoning was mostly reversed by performing electrolysis at 20 C in S free electrolyte but not at 70 C. Measurements on planar disk electrodes showed distinct stripping waves for S adsorbed at OCP. The stripping waves were influenced by both temperature and the presence of CO2. These measurements show the potential dependant nature of electrode recovery where at elevated temperature adequate polarization to strip S was prevented by H2 evolution. Poisoning during operation leads to a temporary decrease in CO produced which can be mostly recovered by exchanging the catholyte. SEM analysis of S-exposed GDEs demonstrated a blocking of the pore-structure at the GDE surface. Preliminary experiments with economical grades of CO2 showed only minor poisoning due to S-containing species leading to only marginal changes in syn-gas composition.","","","Idaho National Lab.

These results suggest that metallic cobalt (Co{sup 0}) is responsible for ethanol conversion via ethanol dehydrogenation whereas Co{sup 2+} plays a role in the CH{sub 4} formation. For both catalysts, the experimental results show that CH4 is mainly produced via CO and/or CO{sub 2} methanation. TPR measurements, on the other hand, show Zn addition inhibits the reduction of Co{sup 2+} and Co{sup 3+}, which would mislead the conclusion that oxidized Co is required to reduce the CH{sub 4} formation. Therefore, TPR may not be appropriate to correlate the degree of metal reducibility (in this case Co{sup 0}) with the catalyst activity for reactions such as ethanol steam reforming where oxidizing conditions exist.","","","Pacific Northwest National Lab.

The amount of surface Pt atoms deposited largely reflects the number of potential cycles causing the deposition and stripping of the metal adlayer at underpotentials, the metal species used as a mediator, and the scan rate of the potential cycles. We employed electrochemical methanol oxidation to gain information on the catalyst's activities. The catalysts with large amounts of surface Pt atoms have relatively high methanol-oxidation activity. Catalysts prepared using this method enhance methanol-oxidation activity per electrode surface area, while maintaining catalytic activity per surface Pt atom; thus, the amount of Pt is reduced in comparison with conventional methanol-oxidation catalysts. The method is suitable for efficient synthesizing various bimetallic catalysts.","","","Brookhaven National Lab.

"Effect of Temperature Gradient on Industrial Gasifier Coal Slag Infiltration into Alumina Refractory","Kaneko, Tetsuya Kenneth; Bennett, James P; Dridhar, Seetharaman","10 SYNTHETIC FUELS; 01 COAL, LIGNITE, AND PEAT","Infiltration characteristics of industrial coal slag into alumina (Al<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub>) refractory material with a temperature gradient induced along the slag's penetration direction are compared to those obtained under near-isothermal conditions. Experiments were conducted with a hot-face temperature of 1450°C and a CO/CO<sub>2</sub> ratio of 1.8, which corresponds to an oxygen partial pressure of ~10<sup>$-$8</sup> atm. The refractory under the near-isothermal temperature profile, with higher average temperatures, demonstrated a greater penetration depth than its counterpart that was under the steeper temperature gradient. Slag that did not infiltrate into the refractory due to the induced temperature gradient, pooled and solidified on the top of the sample. Within the pool, a conglomerated mass of troilite (FeS) formed separately from the surrounding slag. Microscopy of the cross-sectioned infiltrated refractories revealed that the slag preferentially corroded the matrix regions closer to the top surface. Furthermore, the formation of a thick layer of hercynite (FeAl<sub>2</sub>O<sub>4</sub>) at the top of refractory/slag interface significantly depleted the slag of its iron-oxide content with respect to its virgin composition.

On a vacuum reduced TiO2(110) surface, which possessed ~5% oxygen vacancy sites, excess methanol displaced preadsorbed acetone molecules to weakly bound and physisorbed desorption states below 200 K, whereas acetone was stabilized to 250 K against displacement by methanol on an oxidized surface through formation of an acetone-diolate species. These behaviors of acetone differ from the competitive interactions between acetone and water in that acetone is less susceptible to displacement by water. Examination of acetone+methanol and acetone+water multilayer combinations shows that acetone is more compatible in water-ice films than in methanol-ice films, presumably because water has greater potential as a hydrogen-bond donor than does methanol. Acetone molecules displaced from the TiO2(110) surface by water are more likely to be retained in the near-surface region, having a greater opportunity to revisit the surface, than when methanol is used as a coadsorbate.

The density profiles indicated that there is no substantial enhancement of anions at the interface for the NaX systems in contrast to what was observed at the air/aqueous interface. The surfactant-like shape of the larger more polarizable halide anions is compensated by the surfactant nature of methanol itself. As a result, methanol hydroxy groups strongly interacted with one side of polarizable anions, in which their induced dipole points, and methanol methyl groups were more likely to be found near the positive pole of anion induced dipoles. Furthermore, salts were found to disrupt the surface structure of methanol, reducing the observed enhancement of methyl groups at the outer edge of the air/liquid methanol interface. With the additional of salts to methanol, the computed surface potentials increased, which is in contrast to what is observed in corresponding aqueous systems, where the surface potential decreases with the addition of salts. Both of these trends have been indirectly observed with experiments. This was found to be due to the propensity of anions for the air/water interface that is not present at the air/liquid methanol interface.

Controlling the flow of CO2 made it possible to maintain set H2:CO ratios with CO accounting for 25-90% of the product and H2 accounting for 10-75%. The cell, after an initial stabilization period of 40 min, displays reproducible, stable behavior. The current cell design brings the current densities for CO2 reduction closer to what is currently achieved in industrial alkaline electrolysis cells.

Although extensive experimental and theoretical efforts have been carried out in the past decades, the most fundamental questions such as the reaction mechanisms and the key reaction intermediates are still in debate. In the present work, a comprehensive reaction network for CO2 hydrogenation to methanol on Cu(111) was studied using periodic density functional theory (DFT) calculations. All of the elementary reaction steps in the reaction network were identified in an unbiased way with the dimer method. Our calculation results show that methanol synthesis from direct hydrogenation of formate on Cu(111) is not feasible due to the high activation barriers for some of the elementary steps. Instead, we find that CO2 hydrogenation to hydrocarboxyl (trans-COOH) is kinetically more favorable than formate in the presence of H2O via a unique proton transfer mechanism. The trans-COOH is then converted into hydroxymethylidyne (COH) via dihydroxycarbene (COHOH) intermediates, followed by three consecutive hydrogenation steps to form hydroxymethylene (HCOH), hydroxymethyl (H2COH), and methanol. This is consistent with recent experimental observations [1], which indicate that direct hydrogenation of formate will not produce methanol under dry hydrogen conditions. Thus, both experiment and computational modeling clearly demonstrate the important role of trace amounts of water in methanol synthesis from CO2 hydrogenation on Cu catalysts. The proposed methanol synthesis route on Cu(111) not only provides new insights into methanol synthesis chemistry, but also demonstrates again that spectroscopically observed surface species are often not critical reaction intermediates but rather spectator species.

SOA was prepared by the dark reaction of ozone and d-limonene at 0.05 - 1 ppm precursor concentrations and collected with a particle-into-liquid sampler (PILS). The PILS extracts were photolyzed by 300 - 400 nm radiation for up to 24 hours. Water-soluble SOA constituents were analyzed using high-resolution electrospray ionization mass spectrometry (HR-ESI-MS) at different stages of photolysis for all SOA precursor concentrations. Exposure to UV radiation increased the average O/C ratio and decreased the average double bond equivalent (DBE) of the dissolved SOA compounds. Oligomeric compounds were significantly reduced by photolysis relative to the monomeric compounds. Direct pH measurements showed that compounds containing carboxylic acids increased upon photolysis. Methanol reactivity analysis revealed significant photodissociation of molecules containing carbonyl groups and formation of carboxylic acids. Aldehydes, such as limononaldehyde, were almost completely removed. The removal of carbonylswas confirmed by the UV-Vis absorption spectroscopy of the SOA extracts where the absorbance in the carbonyl n→π* band decreased significantly upon photolysis. The effective quantum yield (the number of carbonyls destroyed per photon absorbed) was estimated as ~ 0.03. The concentration of peroxides did not change significantly during photolysis as quantified with an iodometric test. Although organic peroxides were photolyzed, the likely end products of photolysis were smaller peroxides, including hydrogen peroxide, resulting in a no net change in the peroxide content.","Royal Society of Chemistry","","Pacific Northwest National Lab.

WO3 is a wide bandgap semiconductor while ReO3 is an electronic conductor. With the advanced molecular beam epitaxy techniques, it is possible to make heterostructures comprised of layers of WO3 and ReO3. These heterostructures might display reactivity different than pure WO3 and ReO3. The interactions of two probe molecules (hydrogen and methanol) with the (001) surfaces of WO3, ReO3, and two heterostructures ReO3/WO3 and WO3/ReO3 were investigated at the density functional theory level. Atomic hydrogen prefers to adsorb at the terminal O1C sites forming a surface hydroxyl on four surfaces. Dissociative adsorption of a hydrogen molecule at the O1C site leads to formation of a water molecule adsorbed at the surface M5C site. This is thermodynamically the most stable state. A thermodynamically less stable dissociative state involves two surface hydroxyl groups O1CH and O2CH. The interaction of molecular hydrogen and methanol with pure ReO3 is stronger than with pure WO3 and the strength of the interaction substantially changes on the WO3/ReO3 and ReO3/WO3 heterostructures. The reaction barriers for decomposition and recombination reactions are sensitive to the nature of heterostructure. The calculated adsorption energy of methanol on WO3(001) of -65.6 kJ/mol is consistent with the previous experimental estimation of -67 kJ/mol.

Both neutral and cationic (+1) charged potassium-promoted systems at different sulfur coverages were considered. Our calculations indicate that the potassium atom readily donates its single 4s valence electron to the MoS2 structure for the neutral potassium-promoted system, and the neutral and cationic potassium-promoted systems demonstrate a similar adsorption behavior. Moreover, potassium changes the magnetic properties known to occur at the metallic edge surface, which have implications for electron spin dependent surface characterization methods (i.e., electron spin/paramagnetic spectroscopy). Potassium in both the neutral and cationic systems tends to maximize its interactions with the available sulfur atoms at the edge surface, preferring sites over four-fold S hollows on fully sulfided Mo and S edges and over the interstitial gap where two to four edge surface S atoms are available for coordination. As the potassium coverage increases, the adsorption energy per potassium atom, surface work function, and transfer of the K 4s electron to the MoS2(100) surface decreases, which is in line with an increased metallization of the potassium adlayer. The potassium adlayer tends to form chains along the interstitial with K-K distances ~1 Å, which is notably less than those of bulk bcc K metal (4.61 Å). Density of states for the potassium-saturated surface suggests enhanced involvement of broad K 3d states beginning just above the Fermi level. Potassium-promotion of MoS2(100) has implications for alcohol catalysis: increasing the surface basicity by increasing the electron charge of the surface, providing hydrogenation-promoting CO site, blocking edge surface that dissociate CO and lead to methanation, and limiting H2 dissociative adsorption to the edge surface and possibly inhibiting the H2 dissociative adsorption via s character electron repulsion.

In the absence of ice overlayers, acetone photodecomposed on TiO2(110) at 95 K by ejection of a methyl radical into the gas phase and formation of acetate on the surface. With ice overlayers, the methyl radicals are trapped at the interface between TiO2(110) and the ice. When water ice was present, these trapped methyl radicals reacted either with each other to form ethane or with other molecules in the ice (e.g., water or displaced acetone) to form methane (CH4), ethane (CH3CH3) and other products (e.g., methanol), with all of these products trapped in the ice. The new products were free to revisit the surface or depart during desorption of the ice. When methanol ice was present, methane formation came about only from reaction of trapped methyl radicals with the methanol ice. Methane and ethane slowly leaked through methanol ice overlayers into vacuum at 95 K, but not through water ice overlayers. Different degrees of site competition between water and acetone, and between methanol and acetone led to different hydrogen abstraction pathways in the two ices. These results provide new insights into product formation routes and solution-phase radical formation mechanisms that are important in heterogeneous photocatalysis.","","","Pacific Northwest National Lab.

We address this question using nanoscale films of methanol and ethanol supercooled liquid solutions of varying composition (7 -93% methanol) at temperatures near their glass transition,Tg. The permeation of Kr through these films is used to determine the diffusivities of the supercooled liquid mixtures. We find that the temperature dependent diffusivities of the mixtures are well-fit by a Vogel-Fulcher-Tamman equation indicating that the mixtures exhibit fragile behavior at temperatures just above their Tg. Further, for a given temperature, the composition dependent diffusivity is well-fit by a Vignes-type equation, i.e. the diffusivity of any mixture can be predicted using an exponential weighting of the diffusion of the pure methanol and ethanol diffusivities. These results show that deeply supercooled liquid mixtures can be used to provide valuable insight into the properties of normal liquid mixtures.","","","Pacific Northwest National Lab.

Measured first-order (k{sub mono}) and zero-order (k{sub dimer}) CH3OH dehydration rate constants depend exponentially on DPE for POM clusters; the value of k{sub mono} depends more strongly on DPE than k{sub dimer} does. The chemical significance of these rate parameters and the basis for their dependences on acid strength were established by using DFT to estimate the energies of intermediates and transition states involved in elementary steps that are consistent with measured rate equations. We conclude from this treatment that CH{sub 3}OH dehydration proceeds via direct reactions of co-adsorbed CH{sub 3}OH molecules for relevant solid acids and reaction conditions. Methyl cations formed at ion-pair transition states in these direct routes are solvated by H{sub 2}O and CH{sub 3}OH more effectively than those in alternate sequential routes involving methoxide formation and subsequent reaction with CH{sub 3}OH. The stability of ion-pairs, prevalent as intermediates and transition states on solid acids, depends sensitively on DPE because of concomitant correlations between the stability of the conjugate anionic cluster and DPE. The chemical interpretation of k{sub mono} and k{sub dimer} from mechanism-based rate equations, together with thermochemical cycles of their respective transition state formations, show that similar charge distributions in the intermediate and transition state involved in k{sub dimer} cause its weaker dependence on DPE. Values of k{sub mono} involve uncharged reactants and the same ion-pair transition state as k{sub dimer}; these species sense acid strength differently and cause the larger effects of DPE on k{sub mono}. Confinement effects in H-BEA affect the value of k{sub mono} because the different sizes and number of molecules in reactants and transition states selectively stabilize the latter; however, they do not influence k{sub dimer}, for which reactants and transition states of similar size sense spatial constraints to the same extent. This combination of theory and experiment for solid acids of known structure sheds considerable light on the relative contributions from solvation, electrostatic and van der Waals interactions in stabilizing cationic transition states and provides predictive insights into the relative contributions of parallel routes based on the size and charge distributions of their relevant intermediates and transition states. These findings also demonstrate how the consequences of acid strength on measured turnover rates depend on reaction conditions and their concomitant changes in the chemical significance of the rate parameters measured. Moreover, the complementary use of experiment and theory in resolving mechanistic controversies has given predictive guidance about how rate and equilibrium constants, often inextricably combined as measured rate parameters, individually depend on acid strength based on the magnitude and spatial distributions of charges in reactants, products and transition states involved in relevant elementary steps. The unique relations between k{sub mono}, k{sub dimer} and DPE developed here for CH{sub 3}OH dehydration can be applied in practice to assess the acid strength of any solid acid, many of which have unknown structures, preventing reliable calculations of their DPE by theory.","","","Pacific Northwest National Lab.

"Integrating desulfurization with CO2-capture in chemical-looping combustion","Solunke, Rahul D.; Veser, Götz","10 SYNTHETIC FUELS; Chemical looping combustion; CO{sub 2} capture; Desulfurization; Process intensification","Chemical looping combustion (CLC) is an emerging technology for clean combustion. We have previously demonstrated that the embedding of metal nanoparticles into a nanostructured ceramic matrix can result in unusually active and sinter-resistant nanocomposite oxygen carrier materials for CLC which maintain high reactivity and high-temperature stability even when sulfur contaminated fuels are used in CLC. Here, we propose a novel process scheme for in situ desulfurization of syngas with simultaneous CO{sub 2}-capture in chemical looping combustion by using these robust nanocomposite oxygen carriers simultaneously as sulfur-capture materials. We found that a nanocomposite Cu-BHA carrier can indeed strongly reduce the H{sub 2}S concentration in the fuel reactor effluent. However, during the process the support matrix is also sulfidized and takes part in the redox process of CLC. This results in SO{sub 2} production during the reduction of the oxygen carrier and thus limits the degree of desulfurization attainable with this kind of carrier. Nevertheless, the results suggest that simultaneous desulfurization and CO{sub 2} capture in CLC is feasible with Cu as oxygen carrier as long as appropriate carrier support materials are chosen, and could result in a novel, strongly intensified process for low-emission, high efficiency combustion of sulfur contaminated fuel streams.","","","National Energy Technology Laboratory (NETL), Pittsburgh, PA, Morgantown, WV, and Albany, OR (United States)","USDOE Office of Fossil Energy (FE)","","United States","2011-02-01T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: Fuel; Journal Volume: 90; Journal Issue: 2","","Medium: X; Size: p. 608-617","","TPR-3137","FE0004000","Journal ID: ISSN 0016-2361","10.1016/j.fuel.2010.09.039","","2019-03-08T00:00:00Z","1053190","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/1053190","","Fuel","2","90"

We utilized a nanocrystal bilayer structure formed by assembling platinum and cerium oxide nanocube monolayers of less than 10 nm on a silica substrate. The two distinct metal-metal oxide interfaces, CeO2-Pt and Pt-SiO2, can be used to catalyse two distinct sequential reactions. The CeO2-Pt interface catalysed methanol decomposition to produce CO and H2, which were subsequently used for ethylene hydroformylation catalysed by the nearby Pt-SiO2 interface. Consequently, propanal was produced selectively from methanol and ethylene on the nanocrystal bilayer tandem catalyst.

These membranes had high pervaporation selectivities, even though gas permeation was mainly through defects, as indicated by Knudsen selectivities for gases. At 300 K and a thermodynamic activity of 0.03, water contracted the NaA crystals by 0.22 vol%, and this contraction increased the helium flux through two NaA membranes by approximately 80%. Crystal contraction also increased the fluxes of i-butane during vapor permeation and i-propanol (IPA) during pervaporation (~ 0.03 wt% water). At activities above 0.07, water expanded NaA crystals and correspondingly decreased the membrane fluxes of helium, i-butane, and IPA. Similarly, methanol contracted NaA crystals by 0.05 vol% at an activity of 0.02, and this contraction slightly increased the helium and i-butane fluxes through a NaA membrane. Above an activity of 0.06, methanol expanded the crystals, and the fluxes of helium and i-butane through a NaA membrane decreased. The adsorbate-induced changes explain some pervaporation behavior reported by others, and they indicate that crystal expansion and contraction may increase or decrease zeolite NaA membrane selectivity by changing the defect sizes.","","","Oak Ridge National Lab.

For example, corn ethanol plants produce distillers grains and solubles. Soybean crushing plants produce soy meal and soy oil, which is used for biodiesel production. Electricity is generated in sugarcane ethanol plants both for internal consumption and export to the electric grid. Future cellulosic ethanol plants could be designed to co-produce electricity with ethanol. It is important to take co-products into account in the life-cycle analysis of biofuels and several methods are available to do so. Although the International Standard Organization's ISO 14040 advocates the system boundary expansion method (also known as the 'displacement method' or the 'substitution method') for life-cycle analyses, application of the method has been limited because of the difficulty in identifying and quantifying potential products to be displaced by biofuel co-products. As a result, some LCA studies and policy-making processes have considered alternative methods. In this paper, we examine the available methods to deal with biofuel co-products, explore the strengths and weaknesses of each method, and present biofuel LCA results with different co-product methods within the U.S. context.","","","Argonne National Lab.

Proteins, the final products of gene expression, indicate cellular priorities, taking into account both transcriptional and posttranscriptional control mechanisms that control adaptive responses. Here, we report the proteomic composition of the o 1.2 lm fraction of a microbial community from Oregon coast summer surface waters, detected with two-dimensional liquid chromatography coupled with electrospray tandem mass spectrometry. Spectra corresponding to proteins involved in protein folding and biosynthesis, transport, and viral capsid structure were the most frequently detected. A total of 36% of all the detected proteins were best matches to the SAR11 clade, and other abundant coastal microbial clades were also well represented, including the Roseobacter clade (17%), oligotrophic marine gammaproteobacteria group (6%), OM43 clade (1%). Viral origins were attributed to 2.5% of proteins. In contrast to oligotrophic waters, phosphate transporters were not highly detected in this nutrient-rich system. However, transporters for amino acids, taurine, polyamines and glutamine synthetase were among the most highly detected proteins, supporting predictions that carbon and nitrogen are more limiting than phosphate in this environment. Intriguingly, one of the highly detected proteins was methanol dehydrogenase originating from the OM43 clade, providing further support for recent reports that the metabolism of one-carbon compounds by these streamlined methylotrophs might be an important feature of coastal ocean biogeochemistry.","","","Oak Ridge National Lab.

Through judicious selection of pillars having adjustable lengths (l{sub S-S}, as measured by the separation between distal sulfur atoms) and guests of various lengths (l{sub g}), the framework architecture can be controlled systematically in a manner that enables regulation of the guest orientation and aggregation in the host framework. Inclusion compounds for which l{sub g}/l{sub S-S} {le} 0.9 exhibit a bilayer architecture with 1-D channels containing guests oriented parallel to the long axis of the pillar. Guests with values of l{sub g} comparable to l{sub S-S}, however, promote the formation of a brick architecture in which the guests and the pillar are arranged in a herringbone motif. Surprisingly, longer guests (l{sub g} = 1.25l{sub S-S}) favor the formation of the bilayer architecture despite their larger volume because the guests are forced to align end-to-end as single-file arrays due to the vertical constraints of the 1-D channels. Bithiophene and biphenyl guests (l{sub g} &lt; l{sub S-S}) are exceptional, promoting bilayer structures in which turnstile rotations of the pillars afford an unusual motif in which the guests are isolated from one another. The ability to synthesize a large family of compounds based on a common supramolecular building block (the GS sheet) permits construction of a structural 'phase diagram' based on two simple molecular parameters, l{sub g} and l{sub S-S}, that can be used to sort the inclusion compounds according to their framework architectures and enable prediction of crystal structures for new host-guest combinations. The effects of these different framework architectures and packing motifs is manifested as bathochromic shifts in the absorption and emission spectra of the guests compared with their spectra in methanol solutions. This behavior is supported by ab initio TDDFT calculations that reproduce the bathochromic shifts associated with the effects of guest-guest and guest-host interactions, combined with conformational constraints imposed on the guest molecules by the rigid host framework.","","","Argonne National Lab.

The decomposition/oxidation of alcohols for the production of hydrogen as a source of fuel requires such support catalyst interaction. Recent studies have suggested the active role of oxide based supports on the catalytic ability of noble metals such as gold, platinum and palladium. Herein, we report the effect of synthesis technique on the catalytic activity of platinum coated on mixed ceria-titania support system. Wet impregnation technique followed by calcination was compared with the chemical reduction of platinum during the coating over oxide support. Methanol decomposition studied using an in-house built catalytic reactor coupled to a mass spectrometer showed that catalyst prepared by thermal reduction of platinum demonstrated better catalytic ability than the catalyst prepared by chemical reduction of platinum. Transmission electron microscopy revealed that the size of both platinum and ceria-titania particles remained unchanged, while the X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) revealed that the oxidation state of platinum was modified by different coating procedures. A shift in the core level binding energy of the Pt 4f towards lower binding energy was observed with chemical reduction. Based on the XPS data it was found that platinum (on ceria-titania supports) in mixed oxidation state outperformed the Pt in reduced metallic state. Results from catalysis and in situ Fourier transform infra red spectroscopy are presented and discussed.","","","Pacific Northwest National Lab. (PNNL), Richland, WA (United States).

The reaction intermediates and activation barriers have been determined for reaction steps to form H2 and CO. For both clusters, methanol decomposition initiated by C-H and O-H bond breaking was investigated. In the case of a Cu4 cluster, methanol dehydrogenation through hydroxymethyl (CH2OH), hydroxymethylene (CHOH), formyl (CHO), and carbon monoxide (CO) is found to be slightly more favorable. For a Co4 cluster, the dehydrogenation pathway through methoxy (CH3O) and formaldehyde (CH2O) is slightly more favorable. Each of these pathways results in formation of CO and H2. The Co cluster pathway is very favorable thermodynamically and kinetically for dehydrogenation. However, since CO binds strongly, it is likely to poison methanol decomposition to H2 and CO at low temperatures. In contrast, for the Cu cluster, CO poisoning is not likely to be a problem since it does not bind strongly, but the dehydrogenation steps are not energetically favorable. Pathways involving C-O bond cleavage are even less energetically favorable. The results are compared to our previous study of methanol decomposition on Pd4 and Pd8 clusters. Finally, all reaction energy changes and transition state energies, including those for the Pd clusters, are related in a linear, Broensted-Evans-Polanyi plot.","","","Pacific Northwest National Lab.

The model simulations accurately and quantitatively describe the inert gas permeation desorption spectra. The simulation results are used to validate universal scaling relationships between the diffusivity, overlayer thickness, and the temperature ramp rate for isothermal and temperature programmed desorption. From these scaling relationships we derive simple equations from which the diffusivity can be obtained using the peak desorption time or temperature for an isothermal or set of TPD experiments respectively without numerical simulation. The results presented here demonstrate that the permeation of gases through amorphous overlayers has the potential to be a powerful technique to obtain diffusivity data in deeply supercooled liquids.","","","Pacific Northwest National Lab.

Surface formate coverages up to 0.25 were produced at temperatures between 413K and 453K on supported (Cu/SiO2) copper and unsupported copper catalysts. The adlayers were produced by various methods including (1) steady state catalytic conditions in CO2-H2 (3:1, 6 bar) atmospheres, and (2) by exposure of the catalysts to formic acid. As reported in earlier work, the catalytic surface at steady state contains bidentate formate species with coverages up to saturation levels of ~ 0.25 at the low temperatures of this study. The reactivity of these formate adlayers was investigated at relevant reaction temperatures in atmospheres containing up to 6 bar H2 partial pressure by simultaneous mass spectrometry (MS) and infrared (IR) spectroscopy measurements. The yield of methanol during the attempted hydrogenation (“titration”) of these adlayers was insignificant (<0.2 mol % of the formate adlayer) even in dry hydrogen partial pressures up to 6 bar. Hydrogen titration of formate species produced from formic acid also failed to produce significant quantities of methanol, and attempted titration in gases consisting of CO-hydrogen mixtures or dry CO2 were also unproductive. The formate decomposition kinetics, measured by IR, were also unaffected by these changes in the gas composition. Similar experiments on unsupported copper also failed to show any methanol. From these results, we conclude that methanol synthesis on copper cannot result from the direct hydrogenation of (bidentate) formate species in simple steps involving adsorbed H species alone. Furthermore, experiments performed on both supported (Cu/SiO2) and unsupported copper catalysts gave similar results implying that the methanol synthesis reaction mechanism only involves metal surface chemistry. Pre-exposure of the bidentate formate adlayer to oxidation by O2 or N2O produces a change to a monodentate configuration. Attempted titration of this monodentate formate/O coadsorbed layer in dry hydrogen produces significant quantities of methanol, although decomposition of formate to carbon dioxide and hydrogen remains the dominant reaction pathway. Simultaneous production of water is also observed during this titration as the copper surface is re-reduced.

In the current study, we use methanol as a probe molecule to demonstrate the possibility to control the decomposition pathways by supporting monolayer coverage of Pt on a tungsten monocarbide (WC) surface. Density functional theory (DFT) results reveal that on the WC and Pt/WC surfaces CH{sub 3}OH decomposes via O-H bond scission to form the methoxy (*CH{sub 3} O) intermediate. The subsequent decomposition of methoxy on the WC surface occurs through the C-O bond scission to form *CH{sub 3}, which reacts with surface *H to produce CH{sub 4}. In contrast, the decomposition of methoxy on the Pt/WC surface favors the C-H bond scission to produce *CH{sub 2} O, which prevents the formation of the *CH{sub 3} species and leads to the formation of a *CO intermediate through subsequent deprotonation steps. The DFT predictions are validated using temperature programmed desorption to quantify the gas-phase product yields and high resolution electron energy loss spectroscopy to determine the surface intermediates from methanol decomposition on Pt, WC, and Pt/WC surfaces.","","","Brookhaven National Lab.

Multimetallic heterogeneous catalysts made by traditional methods are usually nonhomogenous while UHV-based methods, such as mass selected clusters or metal vapor deposited on single crystals, lead to considerably more homogeneous, well-defined samples. However, these well-defined samples have low surface areas and do not lend themselves to catalytic activity tests in flow reactors under industrially relevant conditions. Bimetallic alloy powders derived by aerosol synthesis are homogeneous and single phase and can have surface areas ranging 1-10 m2/g, making them suitable for use in conventional flow reactors. The utility of aerosol-derived alloy powders as model catalysts is illustrated through the synthesis of single phase PdZn which was used to derive the specific reactivity of the L10 tetragonal alloy phase for methanol steam reforming. Turnover frequencies on unsupported PdZn were determined from the experimentally determined metal surface area to be 0.21 molecules of methanol reacted per surface Pd at 250 °C and 0.06 molecules of CO oxidized to CO2 per surface Pd at 185 °C.

An attractive possibility is to use CO{sub 2} captured from industrial emissions as a feedstock for the production of useful fuels and precursors such as carbon monoxide and methanol. An active field of research to achieve this goal is the development of catalysts capable of harnessing solar energy for use in artificial photosynthetic processes for CO{sub 2} reduction. Transition-metal complexes are excellent candidates, and it has already been shown that they can be used to reduce CO{sub 2} with high quantum efficiency. However, they generally suffer from poor visible light absorption, short catalyst lifetimes, and poor reaction rates. In this Perspective, the field of photocatalytic CO{sub 2} reduction is introduced, and recent developments that seek to improve the efficiency of such catalytic processes are highlighted, especially CO{sub 2} reduction with supramolecules and molecular systems in supercritical CO{sub 2} (scCO{sub 2}) or biphasic ionic liquid-scCO{sub 2} mixtures.","","","Brookhaven National Lab.

Here we demonstrate that these traditional models are insufficient. To understand electrocatalytic trends in the oxygen reduction reaction (ORR), the hydrogen oxidation reaction (HOR) and the oxidation of methanol on platinum surfaces in alkaline electrolytes, noncovalent interactions must be considered. We find that non-covalent interactions between hydrated alkali metal cations M⁺(H2O)x and adsorbed OH (OHad) species increase in the same order as the hydration energies of the corresponding cations (Li⁺>> Na⁺> K⁺> Cs⁺) and also correspond to an increase in the concentration of OHad–M⁺ (H2O)x clusters at the interface. These trends are inversely proportional to the activities of the ORR, the HOR and the oxidation of methanol on platinum (Cs⁺> K⁺> Na⁺>> Li⁺), which suggests that the clusters block the platinum active sites for electrocatalytic reactions. interface.

Using a screening method, the chemical reaction steps that most strongly influence a given kinetic observable are identified. The associated rate coefficients are then improved by high-level quantum chemistry and transition-state-theory calculations, which leads to new values for the coefficients and smaller uncertainty ranges. This updating process is continued as new reactions emerge as the most important steps in the target observable. The screening process employed is a global sensitivity analysis that involves Monte Carlo sampling of the full N-dimensional uncertainty space of rate coefficients, where N is the number of reaction steps. The method is applied to the methanol combustion mechanism of Li et al. (Int. J. Chem. Kinet. 2007, 39, 109.). It was found that the CH{sub 3}OH + HO{sub 2} and CH{sub 3}OH + O{sub 2} reactions were the most important steps in setting the ignition delay time, and the rate coefficients for these reactions were updated. The ignition time is significantly changed for a broad range of high-concentration methanol/oxygen mixtures in the updated mechanism.","","","Argonne National Lab.

The reaction intermediates and activation barriers have been determined for reaction steps to form H{sub 2} and CO. For both clusters, methanol decomposition initiated by C-H and O-H bond breaking was investigated. In the case of a Cu{sub 4} cluster, methanol dehydrogenation through hydroxymethyl (CH{sub 2}OH), hydroxymethylene (CHOH), formyl (CHO), and carbon monoxide (CO) is found to be slightly more favorable. For a Co{sub 4} cluster, the dehydrogenation pathway through methoxy (CH{sub 3}O) and formaldehyde (CH{sub 2}O) is slightly more favorable. Each of these pathways results in formation of CO and H{sub 2}. The Co cluster pathway is very favorable thermodynamically and kinetically for dehydrogenation. However, since CO binds strongly, it is likely to poison methanol decomposition to H{sub 2} and CO at low temperatures. In contrast, for the Cu cluster, CO poisoning is not likely to be a problem since it does not bind strongly, but the dehydrogenation steps are not energetically favorable. Pathways involving C-O bond cleavage are even less energetically favorable. The results are compared to our previous study of methanol decomposition on Pd{sub 4} and Pd{sub 8} clusters. Finally, all reaction energy changes and transition state energies, including those for the Pd clusters, are related in a linear, Broensted?Evans?Polanyi plot.","","","Argonne National Lab.

The Ce{sub 1-x}Ni{sub x}O{sub 2-y} systems adopt a lattice with a fluorite-type structure with an acute local order where Ni displays a strongly distorted (oxygen) nearest-neighbor coordination and the presence of Ni atoms as first cation distances, pointing to the existence of Ni-O-Ni entities embedded into the ceria lattice. A Ni {leftrightarrow} Ce exchange within the CeO{sub 2} leads to a charge redistribution and the appearance of O vacancies. The Ni?O bonds in Ce{sub 1-x}Ni{sub x}O{sub 2-y} are more difficult to reduce than the bonds in pure NiO. The specific structural configuration of Ni inside the mixed-metal oxide leads to a unique catalyst with a high activity for the water gas shift (CO + H{sub 2}O {yields} H{sub 2} + CO{sub 2}) reaction and a simultaneous reduction of the methanation activity of nickel.

High pressure reactivity studies show that Cunanoparticles supported on a ZnO(000{bar 1}) single crystal exhibit a higher catalytic activity than the Cu(111) planar surface. Complementary density functional theory (DFT) calculations of methanol synthesis were also performed for a Cu(111) surface and unsupported Cu{sub 29} nanoparticles, and the results support a higher activity for Cu nanoparticles. The DFT calculations show that methanol synthesis on Cu surfaces proceeds through a formate intermediate and the overall reaction rate is limited by both formate and dioxomethylene hydrogenation. Moreover, the superior activity of the nanoparticle is associated with its fluxionality and the presence of low-coordinated Cu sites, which stabilize the key intermediates, e.g. formate and dioxomethylene, and lower the barrier for the rate-limiting hydrogenation process. The reverse water-gas-shift (RWGS) reaction (CO{sub 2} + H{sub 2} {yields} CO + H{sub 2}O) was experimentally observed to compete with methanol synthesis and was also considered in our DFT calculations. In agreement with experiment, the rate of the RWGS reaction on Cu nanoparticles is estimated to be 2 orders of magnitude faster than methanol synthesis at T = 573 K. The experiments and calculations also indicate that CO produced by the fast RWGS reaction does not undergo subsequent hydrogenation to methanol, but instead simply accumulates as a product. Methanol production from CO hydrogenation via the RWGS pathway is hindered by the first hydrogenation of CO to formyl, which is not stable and prefers to dissociate into CO and H atoms on Cu. Our calculated results suggest that the methanol yield over Cu-based catalysts could be improved by adding dopants or promoters which are able to stabilize formyl species or facilitate the hydrogenation of formate and dioxomethylene. the RWGS pathway is hindered by the first hydrogenation of CO to formyl, which is not stable and prefers to dissociate into CO and H atoms on Cu.

We transformed thin solid films into solutions through exposure to solvent vapor and studied the nucleation and growth of ordered three-dimensional structures in such solutions, with emphasis on the dependence of these processes on supersaturation with respect to the solubility limit. Interestingly, polymer solubility could be significantly influenced via variation of humidity in the surrounding gas phase. It is concluded that the interfacial tension between the ordered structures and the solution increased with humidity. The same effect was observed for other protic non-solvents in the surrounding gas phase and is attributed to a complexation of poly({gamma}-benzyl-L-glutamate) by protic non-solvent molecules (via hydrogen-bonding interactions). This change of polymer solubility was demonstrated to be reversible by addition or removal of small amounts of protic non-solvent in the surrounding gas phase. At a constant polymer concentration, ordered ellipsoidal structures could be dissolved by removing water or methanol present in the solution.

The reaction conditions were varied to elucidate the differences in reaction pathways on both catalysts. On Co/ZnO, CH4 is a secondary product formed through the methanation reaction, while it is produced directly by ethanol decomposition on Rh. The difference in the reaction mechanism is shown to favor Co-based catalysts for selective hydrogen production under elevated system pressures (up to 15 bar) of industrial importance. The carbon deposition rate was also studied, and we show that Co is more prone to coking and catalyst failure. However, the Co/ZnO catalyst can be regenerated, by mild oxidation, despite the high carbon deposition rate. We conclude that Co/ZnO is a more suitable catalyst system for steam reforming of ethanol due to the low methane selectivity, low cost and possibility of regeneration with mild oxidation.","","","Pacific Northwest National Lab.

In situ quartz crystal microbalance measurements as well as ex situ measurements performed on planar substrates revealed that the Pd growth begins with a relatively slow nucleation process and accelerates once an adequate amount of Pd has deposited on the surface. Furthermore, the Pd nucleation is faster on ALD ZnO surfaces compared to ALD Al2O3 surfaces. ALD was utilized to synthesize highly dispersed, uniform Pd nanoparticles (1 to 2 nm in diameter) on ALD ZnO and Al2O3 coated mesoporous silica gel, and the catalytic performances of these samples were compared in the methanol decomposition reaction. The ALD Pd-Al2O3 showed high activity and hydrogen selectivity at relatively low temperatures while the ALD Pd-ZnO showed very low activity as well as quick deactivation. In situ extended X-ray absorption fine structure (EXAFS) measurement revealed that the Pd supported on ZnO 'dissolves' into the substrate during the methanol decomposition reaction which accounts for the gradual disappearance of its catalytic activity. By applying one cycle of ALD Al2O3 on top of the Pd-ZnO catalyst, the activity was enhanced and the catalyst deactivation was mitigated. This Al2O3 overcoating method stabilizes the Pd-ZnO and effectively prevents the dissolution of Pd into the ZnO substrate.","","","Argonne National Lab.

The PdZn particle size was varied by adjusting Pd loading and reducing the catalysts at different temperatures. XRD and IR spectroscopy characterization confirmed the absence of metallic Pd on the catalyst surface. Consequently, the effect of PdZn alloy particle size on the RWGS reaction can be unambiguously studied without the complication of reactions catalyzed by metallic Pd. The results indicated that the turnover frequency increases as the PdZn crystallite size decreases. Interestingly, this structure relationship between PdZn particle size and RWGS activity is consistent with that previously observed for the steam reforming of methanol, i.e., higher CO selectivity on smaller PdZn particles. Thus, RWGS has been identified as a likely potential reaction pathway to undesired CO formation in methanol steam reforming on Pd/ZnO catalysts for hydrogen production.","","","Pacific Northwest National Lab.

In this paper, density functional theory was employed to investigate the methanol synthesis from CO{sub 2} and H{sub 2} on a Mo{sub 6}S{sub 8} cluster. The Mo{sub 6}S{sub 8} cluster is the structural building block of the Chevrel phase of molybdenum sulfide, and has a cagelike structure with an octahedral Mo{sub 6} metallic core. Our calculations indicate that the preferred catalytic pathway for methanol synthesis on the Mo{sub 6}S{sub 8} cluster is very different from that of bulklike MoS{sub 2}. MoS{sub 2} promotes the C-O scission of H{sub x}CO intermediates, and therefore, only hydrocarbons are produced. The lower S/Mo ratio for the cluster compared to stoichiometric MoS{sub 2} might be expected to lead to higher activity because more low-coordinated Mo sites are available for reaction. However, our results show that the Mo{sub 6}S{sub 8} cluster is not as reactive as bulk MoS{sub 2} because it is unable to break the C-O bond of H{sub x}CO intermediates and therefore cannot produce hydrocarbons. Yet, the Mo{sub 6}S{sub 8} cluster is predicted to have moderate activity for converting CO{sub 2} and H{sub 2} to methanol. The overall reaction pathway involves the reverse water-gas shift reaction (CO{sub 2} + H{sub 2} {yields} CO + H{sub 2}O), followed by CO hydrogenation via HCO (CO + 2H{sub 2} {yields} CH{sub 3}OH) to form methanol. The rate-limiting step is CO hydrogenation to the HCO with a calculated barrier of +1 eV. This barrier is much lower than that calculated for a comparably sized Cu nanoparticle, which is the prototypical metal catalyst used for methanol synthesis from syngas (CO + H{sub 2}). Both the Mo and S sites participate in the reaction with CO{sub 2}, CO, and CH{sub x}O preferentially binding to the Mo sites, whereas S atoms facilitate H-H bond cleavage by forming relatively strong S-H bonds. Our study reveals that the unexpected activity of the Mo{sub 6}S{sub 8} cluster is the result of the interplay between shifts in the Mo d-band and S p-band and its unique cagelike geometry.","","","Brookhaven National Lab.

The conformations and packing of the chains depend on the structure-directing alkali metals.

Single-crystal X-ray diffraction studies showed an average cubic NaCl-type structure for {alpha}-LiAsSe{sub 2}, which was further demonstrated to be locally distorted by pair distribution function (PDF) analysis. The {beta} and {gamma} forms have polar structures built of different (1/{infinity})[AsSe{sub 2}{sup -}] chain conformations, whereas the {delta} form has nonpolar packing. A wide range of direct band gaps are observed, depending on composition: namely, 1.11 eV for {alpha}-LiAsSe{sub 2}, 1.60 eV for LiAsS{sub 2}, 1.75 eV for {gamma}-NaAsSe{sub 2}, 2.23 eV for NaAsS{sub 2}. The AAsQ{sub 2} materials are soluble in common solvents such as methanol, which makes them promising candidates for solution processing.

The polar {gamma}-NaAsSe{sub 2} shows very large nonlinear optical (NLO) second harmonic generation (SHG) response in the wavelength range of 600-950 nm.

The addition of Li also increases formation of C2 oxygenates at the expense of C1 species, methanol and methane. This is attributed to enhanced dispersion of Rh by Li that appears to reduce dissociation of CO, which previous studies have shown requires large ensembles of Rh atoms on the surface. Li promotion appears to increase the associatively adsorbed CO, allowing for increased H2 chemisorption on the surface compared to the dissociative adsorption of the same number of CO atoms. This increases selectivity to ethanol compared to the unpromoted catalysts. CO-TPD shows more reactive adsorbed CO species on the Li-promoted catalyst. FTIR results suggest that Li promotion alters CO bonding at bridged or interfacial sites and its effect is more structural than electronic.","","","Oak Ridge National Lab.

All of the alcohols adsorb at low temperature by forming alkoxy and hydroxyl species on the surface. On fully oxidized CeO{sub 2}(111), recombination occurs between some of the alkoxys and hydroxyls, resulting in alcohol desorption near 220 K. At the same temperature, some of the surface hydroxyls disproportionate to produce water and the loss of lattice O. The remaining alkoxys react above 550 K. The primary alcohols favor dehydrogenation products (aldehydes). There is a net loss of O from the system, resulting in a reduction of the ceria. The secondary alcohol, 2-propanol, undergoes primarily dehydration, producing propene with no net change in the cerium oxidation state. Reduced CeO{sub X}(111) competes with the gaseous products for available O. Little or no water is produced. The reaction selectivity for the C{sub 2} and C{sub 3} alcohols shifts toward favoring dehydration products. The loss of O from the alcohols leads to oxidation of the reduced ceria. Compared with the oxidized surface, the alkene desorption shifts to lower temperature, whereas the aldehyde desorption shifts to higher temperature. This indicates that, on the reduced surface, it is easier to break the C-O bond but more difficult to break the O-substrate bond.","","","Oak Ridge National Lab.

Most adsorbates expanded the zeolite crystals below saturation loading at 303 K: n-hexane and SF6 in B-ZSM-5, methanol and CO2 in SAPO-34, and methanol in NaA zeolite. As the loadings increased, the crystals expanded more. Changes in the unit cell volumes of B-ZSM-5 and SAPO-34 zeolite powders correlated with changes in permeation through zeolite membranes defects. When the zeolite crystals expanded or contracted upon adsorption, the defect sizes decreased or increased. In B-ZSM-5 membranes, the fluxes through defects decreased dramatically when n-hexane or SF6 adsorbed. In contrast, i-butane adsorption at 303 K contracted B-ZSM-5 crystals at low loadings and expanded them at higher loadings. Correspondingly, the flux through B-ZSM-5 membrane defects increased at low i-butane loadings and decreased at high loading because the defects increased in size at low loading and decreased at high loadings. At 398 K and 473 K, n-hexane expanded the B-ZSM-5 unit cell more as the temperature increased from 303 to 473 K. The silicalite-1 and B-ZSM-5 unit cell volumes expanded similarly upon n-hexane adsorption at 303 K; boron substitution had little effect on volume expansion.","","","Oak Ridge National Lab.

Results for several different fuels are included. For a stoichiometric mixture of methanol and air, TCR can increase the estimated ideal engine second law efficiency by about 3% for constant pressure reforming and over 5% for constant volume reforming. For ethanol and isooctane, the estimated second law efficiency increases for constant volume reforming are 9 and 11%, respectively. The second law efficiency improvements from TCR result primarily from the higher intrinsic exergy of the reformed fuel and pressure boost associated with the gas mole increase. Reduced combustion irreversibility may also yield benefits for future implementations of combined cycle work extraction.","","","Oak Ridge National Lab. (ORNL), Oak Ridge, TN (United States).

Performance was improved by sequential reactions, allowing separation of by-product glycerine and injection of additional small aliquots of methanol. The kinetics was modeled using a three-step mechanism of reversible reactions, which was used to predict performance at commercial scale.

The site has been well studied in terms of its geological and geochemical properties over the past decade. However, despite the importance of microorganisms in bioremediation processes, the microbiological populations at the WAG5 site and their potential in bioremediation have not been similarly evaluated. In this study, we initiated research to characterize the microbial populations in WAG5 groundwater. Approximately 100 isolates from WAG5 groundwater were isolated and selected based on colony morphology. Fifty-five unique isolates were identified by BOX-PCR and subjected to further characterization. 16S rRNA sequences indicated that these isolates belong to seventeen bacterial genera including Alcaligenes (1 isolate), Aquamonas (1), Aquaspirillum (1), Bacillus (10), Brevundimonas (5), Caulobacter (7), Dechloromonas (2), Janibacter (1), Janthinobacterium (2), Lactobacillus (1), Paenibacillus (4), Pseudomonas (9), Rhodoferax (1), Sphingomonas (1), Stenotrophomonas (6), Variovorax (2), and Zoogloea (1). Metal respiration assays identified several isolates, which phylogenically belong or are close to Caulobacter, Stenotrophomonas, Bacillus, Paenibacillus and Pseudomonas, capable of reducing Co(III)EDTA- to Co(II)EDTA{sup 2-} using the defined M1 medium under anaerobic conditions. In addition, using WAG5 groundwater directly as the inoculants, we found that organisms associated with WAG5 groundwater can reduce both Fe(III) and Co(III) under anaerobic conditions. Further assays were then performed to determine the optimal conditions for Co(III) reduction. These assays indicated that addition of various electron donors including ethanol, lactate, methanol, pyruvate, and acetate resulted in metal reduction. These experiments will provide useful background information for future bioremediation field experiments at the WAG5 site.","","","Oak Ridge National Lab.

In recent years, the more conventional extended X-ray absorption fine structure (EXAFS) data analysis technique has been complemented by two newer analysis methods: the 'atomic' XAFS (AXAFS) technique, which analyzes the scattering from the absorber atom itself, and the {Delta}{mu} XANES technique, which uses a difference method to isolate the changes in the X-ray absorption near edge structure (XANES) due to adsorbates on a metal surface. With AXAFS it is possible to follow the electronic effect a support has on a metal particle; with {Delta}{mu} XANES it is possible to determine the adsorbate, the specific adsorption sites and adsorbate coverage on a metal catalyst. This unprecedented new information helps a great deal to unravel the complex kinetic mechanisms operating in working reactors or fuelcell systems. The fundamental principles and methodology for applying the AXAFS and {Delta}{mu} XANES techniques are given here, and then specific applications are summarized, including H adsorption on supported Pt in the gas phase, wateractivation at a Pt cathode and methanol oxidation at a Pt anode in an electrochemical cell, sulfur oxidation on Pt, and oxygenreduction on a Au/SnO{sub x} cathode. Finally, the future outlook for time and/or space resolved applications of these techniques is contemplated.","","","Brookhaven National Lab. (BNL), Upton, NY (United States).

The CO, OH, and H relative adsorbate coverages on Pt are determined as a function of the applied potential via the {Delta}XANES technique and compared with comparable data previously reported for Pt{sub n}Ru. The more reactive Sn and Mo atoms on the Pt surface form the oxide over the potentials of interest, while Ru has variable oxide content depending on Ru island size and potential. The strength of the electronic ligand effect appears to increase in the order Ru &lt; MoO{sub n} &lt; SnO{sub n} &lt; RuO{sub n}, where the Pt-CO bond strength is found to decrease and the Pt-OH bond strength increase with ligand effect. In the Sn and Mo bimetallics, the ligand effect is found to be sufficiently strong to allow CO replacement by H{sub 2} at low potentials. These widely different ligand effects may provide a straightforward explanation for the previously observed anode behavior in fuel cells: Pt{sub n}Mo better in reformate but Pt{sub n}Ru better in methanol.","","","Brookhaven National Lab.

Further, CO annealing experiments and in situ X-ray adsorption measurements clearly compare the role of surface step for ORR and MOR on Pt nanoparticles.

TPD experiments show that methanol and formaldehyde desorb as the two main products at 575 K, while water, formaldehyde and CO are produced above 800 K. IRAS studies demonstrate that DMMP adsorbs via the phosphoryl oxygen at 200 K, but the P{double_bond}O bond converts to a bridging O{single_bond}P{single_bond}O species at 300 K. DMMP decomposition initially occurs via P{_}OCH{sub 3} bond scission to form methyl methylphosphonate (MMP) and methyl phosphonate (MP) between 300 and 500 K; XPS and IRAS data are consistent with a methoxy intermediate on the surface at these temperatures. The more stable P{_}CH{sub 3} bonds remain intact up to 700 K, and the only surface intermediate at higher temperatures is believed to be PO{sub x}. Although the presence of PO{sub x} decreases activity for DMMP decomposition, some activity on the ceria surface remains even after 7 cycles of adsorption and reaction. The ceria films become reduced by multiple DMMP adsorption-reaction cycles, with the Ce{sup +4} content dropping to 30% after seven cycles. Investigations of DMMP reaction on reduced ceria surfaces show that CO and H{sub 2} are produced in addition to methanol and formaldehyde. Furthermore, DMMP decomposition activity on the reduced ceria films is almost completely inhibited after only 3 adsorption-reaction cycles. Similarities between DMMP and methanol chemistry on the ceria films suggest that methoxy is a key surface intermediate in both reactions.","","","Brookhaven National Lab.

The Ce{sub 1-x}Ni{sub x}O{sub 2-y} systems adopt a lattice with a fluorite-type structure with an acute local order where Ni displays a strongly distorted (oxygen) nearest-neighbor coordination and the presence of Ni atoms as first cation distances, pointing to the existence of Ni-O-Ni entities embedded into the ceria lattice. A Ni {leftrightarrow} Ce exchange within the CeO{sub 2} leads to a charge redistribution and the appearance of O vacancies. The Ni-O bonds in Ce{sub 1-x}Ni{sub x}O{sub 2-y} are more difficult to reduce than the bonds in pure NiO. The specific structural configuration of Ni inside the mixed-metal oxide leads to a unique catalyst with a high activity for the water gas shift (CO + H{sub 2}O {yields} H{sub 2} + CO{sub 2}) reaction and a simultaneous reduction of the methanation activity of nickel.

Mechanisms of reaction were found using min-mode following saddle point searches based upon forces and energies from density functional theory. Rates of reaction were calculated with harmonic transition state theory. The dynamics followed a pathway from CH3-OH, CH3-O, CH2-O, CH-O and finally C-O. Our calculations confirm that methanol decomposition starts with breaking the O-H bond followed by breaking C-H bonds in the dehydrogenated intermediates until CO is produced. The bridge site on the Cu(100) surface is the active site for scissoring chemical bonds. Reaction intermediates are mobile on the surface which allows them to find this active reaction site. This study illustrates how the adaptive kinetic Monte Carlo method can model the dynamics of surface chemistry from first principles.","","","Pacific Northwest National Lab.

The technique allows for measurement of supercooled liquid self-diffusion at temperatures just above the glass transition. The diffusivity near the glass transition is characterized by an activation energy and prefactor that are seven and 1030 times greater, respectively, than those of the room temperature liquid. The temperature dependence of the diffusivity is well-described by a Vogel-Fulcher-Tamman (VFT) equation.

We have investigated 11 different molecular and dissociated adsorption structures of CH3OH at 1 monolayer coverage. The relative stabilities of different structures depend on the chemisorption-induced charge transfer, the relative strengths of different types of hydrogen bonds, the steric hindrance between methyl groups and the surface stress. We found the intermolecular hydrogen bonding to play an important role in stabilizing the overlayer. We also investigated the occupied and unoccupied surface electronic structure, and the adsorbate-induced surface dipole moment and work-function changes. The electronic structures show that the highest-occupied molecular orbital of CH3OH is near the valance-band maximum, which reflects the character of CH3OH as a hole scavenger on TiO2 surfaces. The unoccupied partially solvated or “wet” electron states for CH3OH on TiO2 are primarily distributed on H atoms of methyl groups. Despite many different structural motifs, the wet-electron-state energy primarily correlates with the surface dipole moment.","","","Pacific Northwest National Lab.

In the last few years, experiments and modeling have been performed on higher molecular weight components of relevance to diesel fuel such as n-hexadecane (n-cetane) and 2,2,4,4,6,8,8-heptamethylnonane (iso-cetane). Chemical kinetic models have been developed for all the n-alkanes up to 16 carbon atoms. Also, there has been much experimental and modeling work on lower molecular weight surrogate components such as n-decane and n-dodecane that are most relevant to jet fuel surrogates, but are also relevant to diesel surrogates where simulation of the full boiling point range is desired. For two-ring compounds, experimental work on decalin and tetralin recently has been published. For multi-component surrogate fuel mixtures, recent work on modeling of these mixtures and comparisons to real diesel fuel is reviewed. Detailed chemical kinetic models for surrogate fuels are very large in size. Significant progress also has been made in improving the mechanism reduction tools that are needed to make these large models practicable in multi-dimensional reacting flow simulations of diesel combustion. Nevertheless, major research gaps remain. In the case of iso-alkanes, there are experiments and modeling work on only one of relevance to diesel: iso-cetane. Also, the iso-alkanes in diesel are lightly branched and no detailed chemical kinetic models or experimental investigations are available for such compounds. More components are needed to fill out the iso-alkane boiling point range. For the aromatic class of compounds, there has been no new work for compounds in the boiling point range of diesel. Most of the new work has been on alkyl aromatics that are of the range C7 to C8, below the C10 to C20 range that is needed. For the chemical class of cycloalkanes, experiments and modeling on higher molecular weight components are warranted. Finally for multi-component surrogates needed to treat real diesel, the inclusion of higher molecular weight components is needed in models and experimental investigations.","","","Lawrence Livermore National Lab.

Using the adsorption energies of 16 intermediates on two different facets of these eight face-centeredcubic transition metals, combined with a simple electrochemical model, we address the differences in the reaction mechanism between the (111) and (100) facets of these metals. We investigate two separate mechanisms for methanol electrooxidation: one going through a CO* intermediate (the indirect pathway) and another that oxidizes methanol directly to CO2 without CO* as an intermediate (the direct pathway). A comparison of our results for the (111) and (100) surfaces explains the origin of methanol electrooxidation’s experimentally-established structure sensitivity on Pt surfaces. For most metals studied, on both the (111) and (100) facets, we predict that the indirect mechanism has a higher onset potential than the direct mechanism. Ni(111), Au(100), and Au(111) are the cases where the direct and indirect mechanisms have the same onset potential. For the direct mechanism, Rh, Ir, and Ni show a lower onset potential on the (111) facet, whereas Pt, Cu, Ag, and Au possess lower onset potential on the (100) facet. Pd(100) and Pd(111) have the same onset potential for the direct mechanism. These results can be rationalized by the stronger binding energy of adsorbates on the (100) facet versus the (111) facet. Using linear scaling relations, we establish reactivity descriptors for the (100) surface similar to those recently developed for the (111) surface; the free energies of adsorbed CO* and OH* can describe methanol electrooxidation trends on various metal surfaces reasonably well.","","","Oak Ridge National Lab.

Increasing steps on single-crystal Pt surfaces is shown to enhance the activity of CO and methanol electro-oxidation up to several orders of magnitude. However, little is known about the surface atomic structure of nanoparticles with sizes of practical relevance, which limits the application of fundamental understanding in the reaction mechanisms established on single-crystal surfaces to the development of active, nanoscale catalysts. In this study, we reveal the surface atomic structure of Pt nanoparticles supported on multiwall carbon nanotubes, from which the amount of high-index surface facets on Pt nanoparticles is quantified. Correlating the surface steps on Pt nanoparticles with the electrochemical activity and stability clearly shows the significant role of surface steps in enhancing intrinsic activity for CO and methanol electro-oxidation. Here, we show that increasing surface steps on Pt nanoparticles of {approx}2 nm can lead to enhanced intrinsic activity up to {approx}200% (current normalized to Pt surface area) for electro-oxidation of methanol.","","","Brookhaven National Lab.

Here, for the first time without recourse to drying methods, we measure the composition and solid density of the principal binding reaction product of cement hydration, calcium-silicate-hydrate (C-S-H) gel, one of the most complex of all gels. We also quantify a nanoscale calcium hydroxide phase that coexists with C-S-H gel. By combining small-angle neutron and X-ray scattering data, and by exploiting the hydrogen/deuterium neutron isotope effect both in water and methanol, we determine the mean formula and mass density of the nanoscale C-S-H gel particles in hydrating cement. We show that the formula, (CaO){sub 1.7}(SiO{sub 2})(H{sub 2}O){sub 1.80}, and density, 2.604 Mg m{sup -3}, differ from previous values for C-S-H gel, associated with specific drying conditions. Whereas previous studies have classified water within C-S-H gel by how tightly it is bound, in this study we classify water by its location - with implications for defining the chemically active (C-S-H) surface area within cement, and for predicting concrete properties.","Nature Publishing Group","","Argonne National Lab.

On the basis of this observation, we suggest a Hydrogen Bio-oil (H{sub 2}Bioil) process using fast hydropyrolysis/HDO that has a potential to produce nearly double the amount of liquid fuel when compared with the existing biofuel processes while requiring only modest quantities of supplementary H{sub 2}. The optimal operating mode for the H{sub 2}Bioil process is suggested to be in an entrained bed mode in presence of H{sub 2} with gas phase HDO of hydropyrolyzed vapors. A remarkable result due to reduced need for the supplementary H{sub 2} is that it provides synergistic integration of the H(2)Bioil process with a coal gasification power plant or a small scale steam natural gas (NG) reformer leading to a dramatic increase in the liquid fuel production from biomass and coal or NG. Here, hot synthesis gas (T&gt;500{sup o}C) from a coal gasifier or methane reformer supplies H{sub 2}/CO for hydropyrolysis and deoxygenation as well as heat for the process. This result is exciting, because it presents us with an option to build integrated H{sub 2}Bioil processes sooner rather than later when the cost effective H{sub 2}, becomes available from a carbon-free energy source such as solar or nuclear. The H{sub 2}Bioil process and its integrated version with a small scale NG reformer have strong potential to be attractive on a small scale while being more efficient than any current biomass to liquid fuel process in operation.","","","","","","United States","2009-07-15T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: AIChE Journal; Journal Volume: 55; Journal Issue: 7","","Medium: X; Size: page(s) 1898-1905","","","","Journal ID: ISSN 0001-1541; AICEAC; TRN: 090900169","10.1002/aic.11785","","2010-06-03T00:00:00Z","21212734","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/21212734","","AIChE Journal","7","55"

The nuclear reactor is a high-temperature helium-cooled reactor that is used primarily to provide power for hydrogen production via hightemperature electrolysis. The supplemental hydrogen is mixed with the outlet stream from an oxygen-blown coal gasifier to produce a hydrogen-rich gas mixture, allowing most of the carbon dioxide to be converted into carbon monoxide, with enough excess hydrogen to produce a syngas product stream with a hydrogen/carbon monoxide molar ratio of about 2:1. Oxygen for the gasifier is also provided by the high-temperature electrolysis process. Results of the analysis predict 90.5% carbon utilization with a syngas production efficiency (defined as the ratio of the heating value of the produced syngas to the sum of the heating value of the coal plus the high-temperature reactor heat input) of 64.4% at a gasifier temperature of 1866 K for the high-moisture-content lignite coal considered. Usage of lower moisture coals such as bituminous can yield carbon utilization approaching 100% and 70% syngas production efficiency.","","","Idaho National Lab.

For the first time, this OHT reactor integrates Fourier Transformation infrared (FT-IR) imaging technique and Raman spectroscopy in operando conditions. Using a focal plane array (HgCdTe FPA, 128x128 pixels, and 1,675 Hz frame rate) detector for the FT-IR imaging system, we are able to simultaneously follow the catalyst activity and selectivity of all parallel reaction channels. Each set of image data has 16, 384 IR spectra with a spectral range of 900-4000 cm-1 in an 8 cm-1 resolution. It only takes 2-20 second, depending on signal to noise ratio, to collect a full image of all reaction channels. Results on reactant conversion and product selectivity are obtained from FT-IR spectral analysis. Six home-designed Raman probes, one for each reaction channel, are used for simultaneous collection of Raman spectra of all catalysts and possible reaction intermediates on the catalyst surface under real reaction environment.

"Simultaneous MS-IR Studies of Surface Formate Reactivity Under Methanol Synthesis Conditions on Cu/SiO2","Yang, Yong; Mims, Charles A; Disselkamp, Robert S; Peden, Charles HF; Campbell, C T","10 SYNTHETIC FUELS; CARBON; CATALYSTS; FORMATES; HYDROGENATION; LIFETIME; METHANOL; PRODUCTION; REMOVAL; SYNTHESIS; TRANSIENTS; WATER GAS; methanol synthesis; water-gas shift; copper silica catalysts; FTIR; SSITKA; Environmental Molecular Sciences Laboratory","The coverages and surface lifetimes of copper-bound formates on Cu/SiO2 catalysts, and the steady-state rates of reverse water-gas shift and methanol synthesis have been measured simultaneously by mass (MS) and infrared (IR) spectroscopies under a variety of elevated pressure conditions at temperatures between 140 and 160°C. DCOO lifetimes under steady state catalytic conditions in CO2:D2 atmospheres were measured by 12C – 13C isotope transients (SSITKA). The values range from 220s at 160°C to 660s at 140°C. The catalytic rates of both reverse water gas shift (RWGS) and methanol synthesis are ~100-fold slower than this formate removal rate back to CO2+1/2 H2, and thus they do not significantly influence the formate lifetime or coverage at steady state. The formate coverage is instead determined by formate’s rapid production / decomposition equilibrium with gas phase CO2+H2. The results are consistent with formate being an intermediate in methanol synthesis, but with the rate-controlling step being after formate production (for example, its further hydrogenation to methoxy). A 2-3 fold shorter life time (faster decomposition rate) was observed for formate under reactions conditions when both D2 and CO2 are present than in pure Ar or D2+Ar alone, attributed to effects of coadsorbates (produced in D2 and CO2) on adsorbed formate reaction pathways. The carbon which appears in the methanol product spends a longer time on the surface than the formate species, 1.8 times as long at 140°C. The additional delay on the surface is attributed in part to readsorption of methanol on the catalyst, thus obscuring the mechanistic link between formate and methanol.","","","Pacific Northwest National Lab.

Catalysts were prepared by solid-state ion-exchange of the H-form of each zeolite with CuCl and were then characterized by FTIR and X-ray absorption spectroscopy (XAS). The XANES portion of the XAS data showed that all of the copper was present as Cu{sup +} cations, and analysis of the EXAFS portion of the data shows the Cu{sup +} cations had a CuO coordination number of 2.1 on Cu-Y and 2.7 on Cu-ZSM-5 and Cu-MOR. Dimethyl carbonate (DMC) was observed as the primary product when a mixture of CH{sub 3}OH/CO/O{sub 2} was passed over Cu-Y, whereas dimethoxy methane was the primary product over Cu-ZSM-5 and Cu-MOR. The higher activity and selectivity of Cu-Y for the oxidative carbonylation of methanol can be attributed to the weaker adsorption of CO on the Cu{sup +} cations exchanged into Y zeolite. In situ IR observations revealed that under reaction conditions, adsorbed CO was displaced by methoxide groups bound to the Cu{sup +} cations. The kinetics of DMC synthesis suggests that the rate-limiting step in the formation of this product was the insertion of CO into CuOCH{sub 3} bonds. The yield of DMC decreased with methanol conversion, likely due to the hydrolysis of DMC to methanol and carbon dioxide.","","","SLAC National Accelerator Lab., Menlo Park, CA (United States)","USDOE","","United States","2009-06-04T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: J.

Infrared and Raman spectroscopy, along with XANES, show that the V/TiO{sub 2} sample consists predominantly of isolated VO{sub 4} units after calcination. Methanol was found to adsorb on the catalyst in three ways at 323 K: (1) molecularly, (2) across Ti-O-Ti bonds to form Ti-OCH{sub 3}/Ti-OH pairs, and (3) across V-O-Ti bonds to form V-OCH{sub 3}/Ti-OH pairs. Upon heating, two desorption peaks for CH{sub 3}OH and H{sub 2}O were observed on all samples below 500 K. Although TiO{sub 2} produced small amounts of CH{sub 2}O, the addition of vanadium greatly enhanced the rate of formaldehyde formation. Also, on the V/TiO{sub 2} samples, it was noticed that the Ti-OCH{sub 3} groups disappear much more rapidly than on TiO{sub 2} alone. This is likely due to the reverse spillover of methoxide species from Ti to V, with the reaction occurring at lower temperatures at the vanadium center. Formate species were also detected during the experiments, and they are assumed to be intermediates in the decomposition of formaldehyde to CO, CO{sub 2}, and H{sub 2}O. The apparent activation energy of V/TiO{sub 2} for the formation of CH{sub 2}O is 16 kcal/mol.","","","SLAC National Accelerator Lab., Menlo Park, CA (United States)","USDOE","","United States","2009-06-01T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: J.

A novel monitoring method that could result in significant cost savings is the use of plants as monitoring devices; previous work indicates that plant tissue samples, especially trunk (core) and branch samples, can be used to delineate soil and groundwater plumes at phytoremediation sites. An important factor in reducing the uncertainty associated with this sampling method is development of a technique to analyze, both consistently and accurately, the chemicals stored in plant tissue samples. The present research presents a simple, robust, and inexpensive technique to recover most of the contaminant in plant branch tissue, irrespective of the age or species of the plant. Trichloroethylene (TCE) was the chemical analyzed. A number of headspace and solvent extraction techniques in the literature were evaluated, including headspace extraction at different incubation times and temperatures and solvent extraction using hexane or hot methanol. Extraction using hot methanol was relatively fast, simple, and reliable; this method recovered more than 89% of the TCE present in branches of five different tree species.","","","Argonne National Lab.

As a model for this conversion, ({mu}-oxo) diiron(III) complex 1 ([Fe{sup III}{sub 2}({mu}-O)({mu}-O{sub 2}H{sub 3})(L){sub 2}]{sup 3+}, L = tris(3,5-dimethyl-4-methoxypyridyl-2-methyl)amine) has been treated consecutively with one eq of H{sub 2}O{sub 2} and one eq of HClO{sub 4} to form 3 ([Fe{sup IV}{sub 2}({mu}-O){sub 2}(L){sub 2}]{sup 4+}). In the course of this reaction a new species, 2, can be observed before the protonation step; 2 gives rise to a cationic peak cluster by ESI-MS at m/z 1,399, corresponding to the [Fe{sub 2}O{sub 3}L{sub 2}H](OTf){sub 2}{sup +} ion in which 1 oxygen atom derives from 1 and the other two originate from H{sub 2}O{sub 2}. Moessbauer studies of 2 reveal the presence of two distinct, exchange coupled iron(IV) centers, and EXAFS fits indicate a short Fe-O bond at 1.66 {angstrom} and an Fe-Fe distance of 3.32 {angstrom}. Taken together, the spectroscopic data point to an HO-Fe{sup IV}-O-Fe{sup IV} = O core for 2. Protonation of 2 results in the loss of H{sub 2}O and the formation of 3. Isotope labeling experiments show that the [Fe{sup IV}{sub 2}({mu}-O){sub 2}] core of 3 can incorporate both oxygen atoms from H{sub 2}O{sub 2}. The reactions described here serve as the only biomimetic precedent for the conversion of intermediates P to Q in the sMMO reaction cycle and shed light on how a peroxodiiron(III) unit can transform into an [Fe{sup IV}{sub 2}({mu}-O){sub 2}] core.","","","SLAC National Accelerator Lab., Menlo Park, CA (United States)","USDOE","","United States","2009-05-28T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: Proc.

Pure liquid ethanol or its blends with liquid fossil fuels such as gasoline or diesel, has been transpired to the surface a porous sphere using an infusion pump. Burning of the fuel takes place on the surface of the porous sphere, which is placed in an air stream blowing upwards with a uniform velocity at atmospheric pressure and temperature under normal gravity conditions. At low air velocities, when ignited, a flame envelopes the sphere. For each sphere size, air stream velocity and fuel type, the fuel feed rate will vary and the same is recorded as the burning rate for that configuration. The flame stand-off distances from the sphere surface are measured by post-processing the digital image of the flame photograph using suitable imaging software. The transition velocity at which the flame moves and establishes itself at the wake region of the sphere has been determined for different diameters and fuel types. Correlations of these parameters are also presented.

Methanol was found to adsorb dissociatively on both Zr-O-Zr and V-O-Zr species to create Zr-OCH{sub 3}/Zr-OH and V-OCH{sub 3}/Zr-OH pairs, respectively.

The absence of CH{sub 2}O during temperature-programmed desorption and oxidation experiments on V/ZrO{sub 2} is likely due to rapid readsorption of the product onto the ZrO{sub 2} support, leading to the formation of formate species and H{sub 2}.

Certain correlations can be used to reduce the number and complexity of DFT calculations necessary to describe trends in activity and selectivity across metal and alloy surfaces, thus extending the reach of DFT to more complex systems. In this work, the well-known family of Brønsted-Evans-Polanyi (BEP) correlations, connecting minima with maxima in the potential energy surface of elementary steps, in tandem with a scaling relation, connecting binding energies of complex adsorbates with those of simpler ones (e.g., C, O), is used to develop a potential-energy surface for ethanol decomposition on 10 transition metal surfaces. Using a simple kinetic model, the selectivity and activity on a subset of these surfaces are calculated. Experiments on supported catalysts verify that this simple model is reasonably accurate in describing reactivity trends across metals, suggesting that the combination of BEP and scaling relations may substantially reduce the cost of DFT calculations required for identifying reactivity descriptors of more complex reactions.","","","Oak Ridge National Lab.

However, commercialization of direct ethanol fuel cells has been impeded by ethanol's slow, inefficient oxidation even at the best electrocatalysts. We synthesized a ternary PtRhSnO{sub 2}/C electrocatalyst by depositing platinum and rhodium atoms on carbon-supported tin dioxide nanoparticles that is capable of oxidizing ethanol with high efficiency and holds great promise for resolving the impediments to developing practical direct ethanol fuel cells. This electrocatalyst effectively splits the C-C bond in ethanol at room temperature in acid solutions, facilitating its oxidation at low potentials to CO{sub 2}, which has not been achieved with existing catalysts. Our experiments and density functional theory calculations indicate that the electrocatalyst's activity is due to the specific property of each of its constituents, induced by their interactions. These findings help explain the high activity of Pt-Ru for methanol oxidation and the lack of it for ethanol oxidation, and point to the way to accomplishing the C-C bond splitting in other catalytic processes.","","","Brookhaven National Lab.

Platinum nanoparticles have been electrodeposited on CNFs surfaces, and their electrocatalytic activities toward MOR have been studied by using cyclic voltammetry, chronoamperometry, and linear sweep voltammograms. Morphologies, textural properties, and the crystalline structure of the CNFs supports and catalysts have been characterized with transmission electron microscopy and scanning electron microscopy. The comparative tests conclude that Pt/PCNFs have the best electrocatalytic performance and good stability at room temperature. The high electrocatalytic activity and stability can be attributed to the specific microstructure of PCNFs, which have large numbers of edge-active carbon atoms on the surface of the CNFs as well as synergistic effects between CNFs and the platinum nanoparticles.

Each elementary step in the methanol decomposition reaction into CO and hydrogen occurs via one of three possible mechanisms: O-H, C-H or C-O bond scission. Multiple reaction pathways for each bond scission have been identified in the present work. Reaction pathway calculations were started from an initial (reactant) state with methanol adsorbed in the most stable geometry on Cu(110). The saddle point and corresponding final state of each reaction or diffusion mechanism were determined without assuming the reaction mechanism. In this way, the reaction paths are determined without chemical intuition. The harmonic pre-exponential factor of each identified reaction is calculated from a normal mode analysis of the stationary points. Then, using harmonic transition state theory, the reaction rate of each identified reaction pathway in the entire reaction network is obtained. The most favorable decomposition route for methanol on Cu(110) is found as follows: . The rate-limiting step in this route is the dehydrogenation of methoxy to formaldehyde. Our calculation results are in agreement with previous experimental observations and results.

"Donor-dependent Extent of Uranium Reduction for Bioremediation of Contaminated Sediment Microcosms","Madden, Andrew S; Palumbo, Anthony V; Ravel, Bruce; Vishnivetskaya, Tatiana A; Phelps, Tommy J; Schadt, Christopher W; Brandt, Craig C; (ORNL); (NIST)","10 SYNTHETIC FUELS; BINDING ENERGY; BIOREMEDIATION; CLOSTRIDIUM; ELECTRONS; ETHANOL; GENE AMPLIFICATION; GLUCOSE; HUMIC ACIDS; METHANOL; MICROCOSMS; MICROORGANISMS; NITRATES; REDOX POTENTIAL; SEDIMENTS; SLURRIES; SULFATES; URANIUM; VALENCE","Bioremediation of uranium was investigated in microcosm experiments containing contaminated sediments from Oak Ridge, Tennessee to explore the importance of electron donor selection for uranium reduction rate and extent. In these experiments, all of the electron donors, including ethanol, glucose, methanol, and methanol with added humic acids, stimulated the reduction and immobilization of aqueous uranium by the indigenous microbial community. Uranium loss from solution began after the completion of nitrate reduction but essentially concurrent with sulfate reduction. When electron donor concentrations were normalized for their equivalent electron donor potential yield, the rates of uranium reduction were nearly equivalent for all treatments (0.55-0.95 {micro}mol L{sup -1} d{sup -1}). Uranium reduction with methanol proceeded after a 15-d longer lag time relative to that of ethanol or glucose. Significant differences were not found with the inclusion of humic acids. The extent of U reduction in sediment slurries measured by XANES at various time periods after the start of the experiment increased in the order of ethanol (5-7% reduced at 77 and 153 d), glucose (49% reduced at 53 d), and methanol (93% reduced at 90 d). The microbial diversity of ethanol- and methanol-amended microcosms in their late stage of U reduction was analyzed with 16S rRNA gene amplification. Members of the Geobacteraceae were found in all microcosms as well as other potential uranium-reducing organisms, such as Clostridium and Desulfosporosinus. The effectiveness of methanol relative to ethanol at reducing aqueous and sediment-hosted uranium suggests that bioremediation strategies that encourage fermentative poising of the subsurface to a lower redox potential may be more effective for long-term uranium immobilization as compared with selecting an electron donor that is efficiently metabolized by known uranium-reducing microorganisms.","","","Argonne National Lab.

The major ESD products from a monolayer of methanol on ASW are quite similar to the ESD products from bulk methanol film: H2, CH4, H2O, C2H6, CO, CH2O, and CH3OH. For 40 ML ASW films, the molecular oxygen, hydrogen, and water ESD yields from the ASW are suppressed with increasing methanol coverage, while the CH3OH ESD yield increases proportionally to the methanol coverage. The suppression of the water ESD products by methanol is consistent with the non-thermal reactions occurring preferentially at or near the ASW/vacuum interface and not in the interior of the film. The water and molecular hydrogen ESD yields from the water layer decrease exponentially with the methanol cap coverage with 1/e constants of ~ 0.6 x 1015 cm-2 and 1.6 x 1015 cm-2, respectively. In contrast, the O2 ESD from the water layer is very efficiently quenched by small amounts of methanol (1/e ~ 6.5 x 1013 cm-2). The rapid suppression of O2 production by small amounts of methanol is due to reactions between CH3OH and the precursors for the O2 - mainly OH radicals. A kinetic model for the O2 ESD which semi-quantitatively accounts for the observations is presented.","","","Pacific Northwest National Lab. (PNNL), Richland, WA (United States).

The bioremediation strategies tested consisted of a series of air, air:methane, and air:methane:nutrient pulses using a horizontal injection well. Sediment core samples (n=367) taken from 0 (surface)-43m depth were probed for genes coding for soluble methane monooxygenase (sMMO) and toluene dioxygenase (TOD), which are known to cometabolize TCE. The same samples were also probed for genes coding for methanol dehydrogenase (MDH) to access changes in methylotrophic bacterial populations. Hybridization results showed that the frequency of detection of sMMO genes were stimulated approximately 250% following 1% methane:air (v/v) injection. Subsequent 4% methane:air (v/v) injection resulted in an 85% decline probably due to nutrient limitations, since subsequent addition of nutrients (gaseous nitrogen and phosphorus) caused an increase in the frequency of detection of sMMO genes. Detection of TOD genes declined during the process becoming non-detectable by the final treatment. These patterns indicate methanotrophs displaced heterotrophs containing TOD genes. Active transcription of sMMO and TOD was evidenced by hybridization to mRNA. These analyses combined with studies showing the concomitant decline in TCE concentrations, increases in methanotroph viable counts, increased mineralization rates of TCE, and increases in chloride inventories provide multiple lines of evidence that TCE remediation was caused specifically by methanotrophs. This work suggests that sMMO genes are responsible for most, if not all, of the biodegradation of TCE observed. This study demonstrated that the use of nucleic acid analytical methods provided a gene specific assessment of the effects of in situ treatment technologies.","","","Pacific Northwest National Lab.

Coelectrolysis is complicated by the fact that the reverse shift reaction occurs concurrently with the electrolytic reduction reactions. All reactions must be properly accounted for when evaluating results. Electrochemical performance of the button cells and stacks were evaluated over a range of temperatures, compositions, and flow rates. The apparatus used for these tests is heavily instrumented, with precision mass-flow controllers, on-line dewpoint and CO2 sensors, and numerous pressure and temperature measurement stations. It also includes a gas chromatograph for analyzing outlet gas compositions. Comparisons of measured compositions to predictions obtained from a chemical equilibrium coelectrolysis model are presented, along with corresponding polarization curves. Results indicate excellent agreement between predicted and measured outlet compositions. Cell area-specific resistance values were found to be similar for steam electrolysis and coelectrolysis. Coelectrolysis significantly increases the yield of syngas over the reverse water gas shift reaction equilibrium composition. The process appears to be a promising technique for large-scale syngas production.","","","Idaho National Lab.

The experimental equilibrium isotherms of LLL for adsorption on a C{sub 12} packing material from an aqueous solution of methanol (48%) and trifluoroacetic acid (0.1%) were measured by frontal analysis (FA). The FA measurements were done with two solutions, one in which the pH was controlled, the other in which it was not. Two solutions of LLL in the mobile phase were prepared (4.3 and 5.4 g/L) and their pH measured (2.94 and 2.88), respectively. The first solution was titrated with TFA to match the pH of the mobile phase (2.03), so its pH was controlled. The pH of the other solution was left uncontrolled. In both cases the isotherms could be modeled by a bi-Langmuir equation, a choice consistent with the bimodal affinity energy distribution (AED) obtained for LLL. The isotherm parameters derived from the inverse method (IM) of isotherm determination under controlled pH conditions (by fitting calculated profiles to experimental breakthrough profiles) are in a good agreement with those derived from the FA data. Under uncontrolled pH conditions, the application of IM suggests the coexistence of two different adsorption mechanisms. According to the isotherm parameters found by these three methods (FA, AED and IM), the C{sub 12}-bonded silica can adsorb around 500 and 70 g/L of LLL under controlled and uncontrolled pH conditions, respectively. The adsorption of LLL on the C{sub 12} material strongly depends on the pH of the mobile phase and on the quantity of TFA added, which plays the role of an ion-pairing agent.","","","Oak Ridge National Lab.

Here we demonstrate that these traditional models are insufficient. To understand electrocatalytic trends in the oxygen reduction reaction (ORR), the hydrogen oxidation reaction (HOR) and the oxidation of methanol on platinum surfaces in alkaline electrolytes, non-covalent interactions must be considered. We find that non-covalent interactions between hydrated alkali metal cations M{sup +}(H{sub 2}O){sub x} and adsorbed OH (OH{sub ad}) species increase in the same order as the hydration energies of the corresponding cations (Li{sup +} &gt;&gt; Na{sup +} &gt; K{sup +} &gt; Cs{sup +}) and also correspond to an increase in the concentration of OH{sub ad}-M{sup +}(H{sub 2}O){sub x} clusters at the interface. These trends are inversely proportional to the activities of the ORR, the HOR and the oxidation of methanol on platinum (Cs{sup +} &gt; K{sup +} &gt; Na{sup +} &gt;&gt; Li{sup +}), which suggests that the clusters block the platinum active sites for electrocatalytic reactions.","","","Argonne National Lab.

Through the comprehensive analysis of structure, host-guest properties, and spin-crossover behaviors, it is found that this pillared Hofmann system uniquely displays both guest-exchange-induced changes to spin-crossover and spin-crossover-induced changes to host-guest properties, with direct dynamic interplay between these two phenomena. Guest desorption and adsorption cause pronounced changes to the spin-crossover behavior according to a systematic trend in which larger guests stabilize the high-spin state and therefore depress the spin-crossover temperature of the host lattice. When stabilizing the alternate spin state of the host at any given temperature, these processes directly stimulate the spin-crossover process, providing a chemisensing function. Exploitation of the bistability of the host allows the modification of adsorption properties at a fixed temperature through control of the host spin state, with each state shown to display differing chemical affinities to guest sorption. Guest desorption then adsorption, and vice versa, can be used to switch between spin states in the bistable temperature region, adding a guest-dependent memory effect to this system.","","","Argonne National Lab.

Among a few catalysts promoted by silicon, molybdenum and tungsten elements, catalysts co-promoted by silicon and molybdenum elements shows best performance. The particle size of promoted Pt/CNTs, calculated from XRD patterns, is small as 3.0 1.5 nm, and the results of transmission electron microscopy (TEM) revealed that the distribution of particle size is uniform.

Cu underpotential deposition, cyclic voltammetry, and x-ray absorption spectroscopy, using both the extended x-ray absorption fine structure and {Delta}{mu} x-ray absorption near-edge spectroscopy analysis techniques, on samples after potential cycling between 0.02 and 0.8 V, revealed the PtRu aging mechanism and offer an explanation of why the two catalysts age differently. The Tanaka catalyst had relatively large RuO{sub x}H{sub y} islands on the surface and underwent little dissolution and agglomeration after 40 cycles. This had little detrimental effect on the CO oxidation properties as seen in the CO stripping data, and therefore, this catalyst can be expected to be relatively more tolerant to poisoning in direct methanol fuel cells. The Johnson-Matthey catalyst, on the other hand, was found to have much smaller Ru islands initially, underwent more Ru dissolution/agglomeration, and showed definite signs of an increase in Ru island size and partial oxidation to RuO{sub x}H{sub y}. The CO stripping data for this catalyst show a significant increase in onset potential with aging, reflecting a change from the predominant bifunctional to ligand-effect mechanism for the CO oxidation.","","","Brookhaven National Lab.

Increasing steps on single-crystal Pt surfaces is shown to enhance the activity of CO and methanol electro-oxidation up to several orders of magnitude. However, little is known about the surface atomic structure of nanoparticles with sizes of practical relevance, which limits the application of fundamental understanding in the reaction mechanisms established on single-crystal surfaces to the development of active, nanoscale catalysts. In this study, we reveal the surface atomic structure of Pt nanoparticles supported on multiwall carbon nanotubes, from which the amount of high-index surface facets on Pt nanoparticles is quantified. Correlating the surface steps on Pt nanoparticles with the electrochemical activity and stability clearly shows the significant role of surface steps in enhancing intrinsic activity for CO and methanol electro-oxidation. Here, we show that increasing surface steps on Pt nanoparticles of {approx}2 nm can lead to enhanced intrinsic activity up to {approx}200% (current normalized to Pt surface area) for electro-oxidation of methanol.","","","Brookhaven National Lab.

Also, electron spin resonance (ESR) spectroscopy is utilized to examine the effects of Ru{sup 3+} ion exchanged Nafion membranes. The {Delta}{mu}-XANES analysis of the data allows a determination of the coverage of Ru with time (minutes to hours) and also to identify the binding site of the deposited Ru species (atop/bridged at low coverage and 3-fold at higher coverage) apparently onto the corners and edges initially and at higher coverage onto the faces of the cubooctahedral clusters when exposed to Ru{sup n+} at OCP. The deposition of Ru appears to be inhibited at potentials where adsorbates (such as H and O(H)) usually adsorb, and Coulomb enhanced at OCP when substantial O exists on the surface. The ESR analysis of Ru{sup 3+} in the Nafion membrane indicates significant detrimental changes to the membrane in the presence of Ru ions; a decrease in the water uptake and an increase in the microviscosity of the fluid regions were noticed. Together these data indicate the critical nature of keeping the fuel cell under potential control and avoiding an uncontrolled shut down under direct methanol operating conditions.","","","Brookhaven National Lab.

Catalysts need to exhibit turnover frequency (TOF) and density (hence size) commensurate with the solar flux at ground level (1000Wm2, airmass (AM) 1.5)[1]to avoid wasting of incidentsolar photons. For example, a catalyst with a TOF of 100 s1 requires a density of one catalytic site per square nanometer. Catalysts with lower rates or taking up a larger space will require a high-surface-area, nanostructured support that affords tens to hundreds of catalytic sites per square nanometer. Furthermore, catalysts need to operate close to the thermodynamic potential of the redox reaction so that amaximum fraction of the solar photon energy is converted to chemical energy. Stability considerations favor all-inorganic oxide materials, as does avoidance of harsh reaction conditions of pH value or temperature.","","","Lawrence Berkeley National Lab.

This database, combined with a simple electrokinetic model of the methanol electrooxidation reaction, yields mechanistic insights that are consistent with previous experimental and theoretical studies on Pt, and extends these insights to a broad spectrum of other transition metals. In addition, by using linear scaling relations between the adsorption free energies of various intermediates in the reaction network, we find that the results determined with the full database of adsorption energies can be estimated by knowing only two key descriptors for each metal surface: the free energies of OH and CO on the surface. Two mechanisms for methanol oxidation to CO₂ are investigated: an indirect mechanism that goes through a CO intermediate and a direct mechanism where methanol is oxidized to CO₂ without the formation of a CO intermediate. For the direct mechanism, we find that, because of CO poisoning, only a small current will result on all non-group 11 transition metals; of these metals, Pt is predicted to be the most active. For methanol decomposition via the indirect mechanism, we find that the onset potential is limited either by the ability to activate methanol, by the ability to activate water, or by surface poisoning by CO* or OH*/O*. Among pure metals, there is no obvious candidate for a good anode catalyst, and in order to design a better catalyst, one has to look for bi-functional surfaces such as the well-studied PtRu alloy.","","","Pacific Northwest National Lab.

We have previously shown that methanol, water adsorption, and aggregation?disaggregation can change the structure of 3 nm diameter zinc sulfide (ZnS). However, in prior observations of water-driven structure change, aggregation also may have taken place. Therefore, we investigated the structural consequences of water adsorption alone on anhydrous nanoparticles that were dried to minimize changes in aggregation. Using simultaneously collected small- and wide-angle X-ray scattering (SAXS and WAXS) data, we showed that water vapor adsorption alone drives a structural transformation in ZnS nanoparticles in the temperature range of 22--40 C. The transition kinetics is strongly temperature dependent, with an activation energy of 55 {+-} 10 kJ/mol, consistent with atom displacement rather than bond breaking. At 50 C, aggregate restructuring occurred, increasing the transition kinetics beyond the rate expected for water adsorption alone. The observation of isosbestic points in the WAXS data suggests that the particles do not transform continuously between the initial and the final structural state but rather undergo an abrupt change from a less ordered to a more ordered state.","","","Argonne National Lab.

The syngas fuel composition considered in this work comprised x% N{sub 2} by volume and (100-x)% an equimolar mixture of CO and H{sub 2}. The proportion x (i.e., %N{sub 2}) was varied from 0 to 60% while the H{sub 2}/CO ratio was always kept as unity. Spherically expanding flames were generated by centrally igniting homogeneous fuel-air gas mixtures in a 40-L cylindrical combustion chamber fitted with optical windows. Shadowgraphy technique with a high-speed imaging camera was used to record the propagating spherical flames. Unstretched burning velocity was calculated following the Karlovitz theory for weakly stretched flames. Also, Markstein length was calculated to investigate the flame stability conditions for the fuel-air mixtures under consideration. Experiments were conducted for syngas fuel with different nitrogen proportions (0-60%) at 0.1 MPa (absolute), 302{+-}3K, and equivalence ratios ranging from 0.6 to 3.5. All the measurements were compared with the numerical predictions obtained using RUN-1DL and PREMIX with a contemporary chemical kinetic scheme. Dilution with nitrogen in different proportions in syngas resulted in (a) decrease in laminar burning velocity due to reduction in heat release and increase in heat capacity of unburned gas mixture and hence the flame temperature, (b) shift in occurrence of peak laminar burning velocity from {phi}=2.0 for 0% N{sub 2} dilution to {phi}=1.4 for 60% N{sub 2} dilution, (c) augmentation of the coupled effect of flame stretch and preferential diffusion on laminar burning velocity, and (d) shift in the equivalence ratio for transition from stable to unstable flames from {phi}=0.6 for 0% N{sub 2} dilution to {phi}=1.0 for 60% N{sub 2} dilution. The present work also indicated that if the fuel mole fraction in the wide range of fuel-air mixtures investigated is less than 22%, then those fuel mixtures are in the unstable regime with regard to preferential diffusion.

Addition of ZrO<sub>2</sub> increased copper dispersion and surface area, with little effect on activity, while palladium promotion significantly enhanced activity with little change of the catalytic structure. A catalyst promoted with both ZrO<sub>2</sub>and palladium yielded hydrogen below 150 C. EXAFS results under reaction conditions showed that the oxidation state of copper was influenced by palladium in the catalyst bulk. A palladium promoted catalyst contained 90% Cu<sup>0</sup>, while the copper in an unpromoted catalyst was 100% Cu<sup>1+</sup> at the same temperature. Palladium preferentially forms an unstable alloy with copper instead of zinc during reduction, which persists during reaction regardless of copper oxidation state. A 100-h time on stream activity measurement showed growth in copper crystallites and change in copper oxidation state resulting in decreasing activity and selectivity. A kinetic model of the reaction pathway showed that palladium and ZrO<sub>2</sub> promoters lower the activation energy of methanol combustion and steam reforming reactions.","","","Argonne National Lab.

These two reactions represent paradigmatic, challenging test cases for electronic structure approaches to transition-metal catalysis. We compare here density-functional approaches against state-of-the-art coupled-cluster and multireference quantum chemistry approaches. The quantum chemical approaches are found to be in close agreement between themselves as well as with the available experimental evidence. For the density-functional calculations, we employ a recently introduced ab initio, self-consistent Hubbard-like correction, coupled here with a generalized-gradient approximation (GGA) for the exchange-correlation functional. We find that our formulation provides a remarkable improvement in the description of the electronic structure, hybridization, and multiplet splittings for all calculated stationary points along these reaction pathways. The Hubbard term, which is not a fitting parameter and, in principle, can augment any exchange-correlation functional, brings the density-functional theory results in close agreement with the reference calculations. In particular, thermochemical errors as large as 1.4 eV in the exit channels with the GGA functional are reduced by an order of magnitude, to less than 0.1 eV on average; additionally, close agreement with the correlated-electron reference calculations and experiments are achieved for intermediate spin splittings and structures, reaction exothermicity, and spin crossovers. The role that the Hubbard U term plays in improving both quantitative and qualitative descriptions of transition-metal chemistry is examined, and its strengths as well as possible weaknesses are discussed in detail.","","","Pacific Northwest National Lab.

Numerous properties such as interfacial width, hydrogen bond populations, dipole moments, and correlation times are characterized with identical schemes to draw useful conclusions on the strengths and weakness of the proposed models for the interface of neat methanol. Our findings indicate that all models considered in this study yield similar results for the radial distribution functions, hydrogen bond populations, and orientational relaxation times. Significant differences in the models appear when examining both the dipole moments and surface relaxation near the aqueous liquid-vapor interface. Here, the density functional theory interaction potential predicts a significant decrease in the molecular dipole moment and slight expansion in the oxygen-oxygen distance as the interface is approached.

Studies of isotopic variants (H/D, 12C/13C) reveal that bidentate formate dominates the copper surface at steady state. The steady-state formate coverages of HCOO (in 6 bar 3:1 H2:CO2) and DCOO (in D2:CO2) are similar and the steady-state formate coverages in both systems decrease by ~80% from 350 K to 550 K. Over the temperature range 413K – 553K, the steady-state methanol synthesis rate shows a weak H/D isotope effect (1.05 ± 0.05) with somewhat higher activation energies in H2:CO2 (79 kJ/mole) than D2:CO2 (71 kJ/mole) over the range 473K-553K. The reverse water gas shift (RWGS) rates are higher than methanol synthesis and also shows a weak positive H/D isotope effect with higher activation energy for H2/CO2 than D2/CO2 (108 vs. and 102 kJ/mole). The reactivity of the resulting formate species in 6 bar H2, 6 bar D2 and 6 bar Ar is strongly dominated by decomposition back to CO2 and H2. H2 and D2 exposure compared to Ar do not enhance the formate decomposition rate. The decomposition profiles on the supported catalyst deviate from first order decay, indicating distributed surface reactivity. The average decomposition rates are similar to values previously reported on single crystals. The average activation energies for formate decomposition are 90 ± 17 kJ/mole for HCOO and 119 ± 11 kJ/mole for DCOO. By contrast to the catalytic reaction rates, the formate decomposition rate shows a strong H/D kinetic isotope effect (H/D ~ 8 at 413K), similar to previously observed values on Cu(110).","","","Pacific Northwest National Lab.

Among the most significant minor components in syngas is hydrogen sulfide (H2S). In addition to its adverse environmental impact, H2S poisons the catalysts and hydrogen purification membranes, and causes severe corrosion in gas turbines. Technologies that can remove H2S from syngas and related process streams are, therefore, of considerable practical interest. To meet this need, we work towards understanding the mechanism by which prospective H2S catalysts perform in simulated fuel gas conditions. Specifically, we show that for low-temperature gas clean-up (~1408C) using activated carbon fibers and water plays a significant role in H2S binding and helps to prolong the lifetime of the material. Basic surface functional groups were found to be imperative for significant conversion of H2S to daughter compounds, whereas metal oxides (La and Ce) did little to enhance this catalysis. We show that although thermal regeneration of the material is possible, the regenerated material has a substantially lower catalytic and sorption capacity.","Taylor & Francis, Oxford, UK","Publisher","National Energy Technology Laboratory (NETL), Pittsburgh, PA, Morgantown, WV, and Albany, OR","USDOE - Office of Fossil Energy (FE)","","United States","2008-09-01T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: Main Group Chemistry; Journal Volume: 7; Journal Issue: 3","","Medium: X; Size: 239-250","","DOE/NETL-IR-2008-301; NETL-TPR-2225","Not cited","Journal ID: ISSN 1024-1221; eISSN 1745-1167; RDS Subtask Number 41817.606.01.05; TRN: US200904%%497","10.1080/10241220802509796","","2009-12-16T00:00:00Z","947183","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/947183","","Main Group Chemistry","3","7"

High resolution ESI-MS showed that reactions of carbonyls with methanol produce significant amounts of hemiacetals and acetals on time scales ranging from several minutes to several days, with the reaction rates increasing in acidified solutions. Carboxylic acid groups were observed to react with methanol resulting in the formation of esters. In contrast, acetonitrile extracts showed no evidence of reactions with analyte molecules, suggesting that acetonitrile is the preferred solvent for SOA extraction. The use of solvent-analyte reactivity as an analytical chemistry tool for the improved characterization of functional groups in complex organic mixtures was also demonstrated. Direct comparison between ESI mass spectra of the same SOA samples extracted in reactive (methanol) versus non-reactive (acetonitrile) solvents was used to estimate the relative fractions of ketones (≥38%), aldehydes (≥6%), and carboxylic acids (≥55%) in d-limonene SOA.","American Chemical Society (ACS)","","Pacific Northwest National Lab.

Specifically, the supports evaluated here consisted of unmodified MCM-41 and SBA-15 mesoporous silicas, and these materials coated with sub-monolayer quantities of alumina, titania, and zirconia. UV-Vis DRS and 31P-NMR spectroscopy showed that the tungstophosphoric acid species retained their chemical identity in the synthesized supported form, although the spectra were influenced by the specific support material used. In addition, their acidic properties were evaluated using temperature programmed oxidation of isopropyl amine. The differences in reaction rates between the samples reflect both the diversity in the amount of Brønsted acidic sites available for catalysis and dissimilarities in coking resistance. These two characteristics depend, in turn, on the type of support modifier used to prepare the catalyst.","","","Pacific Northwest National Lab. (PNNL), Richland, WA (United States).

However, the resurgent interest in technologies aimed at enabling biomass to sugars/fuels processes have again pointed to this intuitive solution. Research challenges in this regard include developing better and more specifically targeted delivery systems for hydrolytic genes, achieving successful folding and post-translational modification of heterologous proteins, and developing cost effective process strategies utilizing these transformed plants. Integration of these concepts, from the improvement of biomass production and conversion characteristics to heterologous production of glycosyl hydrolases in a high yielding bioenergy crop, holds considerable promise for improving the lignocellulosic biomass to ethanol/fuels process.","","","Pacific Northwest National Lab.

In experiments, the exhaust gas was analyzed for hydrogen, carbon monoxide, carbon dioxide, methane, and hydrocarbon species over equivalence ratios from 1.4 to 3.8 and a range of mixture inlet velocities. The efficiency of the noncatalytic fuel reformer regarding hydrogen production, carbon monoxide production and energy conversion is assessed. At constant inlet velocity, hydrogen production increases with increasing equivalence ratio, whereas hydrogen conversion efficiency reaches its peak value around an equivalence ratio of 3.0. Tests at a constant equivalence ratio of 2.5 show that conversion efficiency increases with mixture inlet velocity, and experimental values in excess of 80% are obtained for the highest tested velocity of 80 cm/s. Similar trends are observed for carbon monoxide conversion and energy efficiencies, where peak values exceed 90% and 80%, respectively. Some discrepancies are noted between the experimental and numerical results in the ultrarich regime. Overall, the results indicate favorable conditions for fuel reforming between equivalence ratios of 2.5 and 3.5 and show that the inlet velocity has a significant effect on the performance of noncatalytic fuel reforming. Substantial efficiency gains are observed for increased inlet velocities, which are attributed to increases in the reactor temperature.

NO2 adsorption at room temperature leads to the formation of surface nitrates and nitrites. DME adsorption on the alumina surface at 300 K leads to molecularly adsorbed DME, molecularly adsorbed methanol and surface methoxides. Upon heating the DME-exposed alumina to 500-600 K the surface is dominated by methoxide groups. At higher temperatures methoxide groups are converted into formates. At T > 510 K formate decomposition takes place to form H2O(g) and CO(g). DME and NO2 coadsorption at 423 K do not indicate a significant reaction between DME and NO2. However, in similar experiments at 573 K, fast reaction occurs and the methoxides present at 573 K before the NO2 adsorption are converted into formates, simultaneously with the formation of isocyanates. Under these conditions, NCO can further be hydrolyzed into isocyanic acid or ammonia with the help of water which is generated during the formate formation, decomposition and/or NCO formation steps.","","","Pacific Northwest National Lab.

The activity of PdZn catalysts can be significantly improved by supporting them on alumina. Here we show that the Pd/ZnO/Al2O3 catalysts have better long-term stability when compared with Cu/ZnO based catalysts, and that they are also stable under redox cycling. The Pd/ZnO/Al2O3 catalysts can be easily regenerated by oxidation in air at 420 ºC followed by re-exposure to reaction conditions at 250 ºC, while the Cu/ZnO based catalysts do not recover their activity after oxidation. Reduction at high temperatures (>420 ºC) leads to Zn loss from the alloy nanoparticle surface resulting in a reduced catalyst activity. However, even after such extreme treatment, the catalyst activity is regained with time on stream under reaction conditions alone, leading to highly stable catalysts. These findings illustrate that the nanoparticle surface is dynamic and changes drastically depending on the environment, and that elevated reduction temperatures are not necessary to achieve high CO2 selectivity.","","","Pacific Northwest National Lab.

The loss of alpha-pinene and formation of gas phase products were followed using proton transfer reaction mass spectrometry (PTR-MS). Gas phase reaction products measured by PTR-MS and their yields include formaldehyde (5 + 1%), formic acid (2.5 + 1.4%), methanol (0.6 + 0.3%), acetaldehyde (3.9 + 1.7%), acetic acid (10 + 2%), acetone (11.5 + 3.1%), pinonaldehyde (22 + 6%), and pinene oxide (0.9 + 0.1%). There was evidence of organic nitrates in the gas phase and small peaks were tentatively assigned to norpinonaldehyde, 4-oxopinonaldehyde, propanedial, 2,3-dioxobutanal and 3,5,6-trioxoheptanal or 3-hydroxymethyl-2,2-dimethylcyclobutylethanone. The formation and growth of new particles were followed using a scanning mobility particle sizer (SMPS), and their chemical composition was probed using single particle mass spectrometry (SPLAT II). SPLAT II analysis also provided measurements of the vacuum aerodynamic diameters of the newly formed secondary organic aerosol (SOA) particles and, in combination with the electrical mobility diameter, a particle density of 1.21 + 0.02 g cm-3 was calculated, 20% larger than often assumed in calculating SOA yields. SPLAT II showed that the suspended SOA consisted of a complex mixture of organic nitrates and organics, possibly including pinonic acid, pinic acid and trans-sobrerol. Three-wavelength light scattering measurements made using an integrating nephelometer were consistent with particles having a refractive index characteristic of organic compounds, but the data could not be well matched at all three wavelengths with a single refractive index. The effect of addition of cyclohexane or NO on particle formation showed that ozonolysis was the major mechanism of SOA formation in this system. However, unlike simple ozonolysis, organic nitrates are formed in both the gas and particle phases. Identifying and measuring specific organic nitrates in both the gas and particle phases in air may help to elucidate why SOA formation has been reported in field studies to be associated with polluted urban areas, yet the carbon in these particles is largely contemporary, i.e., non-fossil fuel carbon.","","","Pacific Northwest National Lab.

Wet incipient impregnation method was used to support cobalt on ZrO2, CeO2 and CeZrO4 followed by pre-reduction with H2 up to 677 °C to attain supported cobalt catalysts. It was found that the non-noble metal based 10 wt % Co/CeZrO4 is an efficient catalyst to achieve ethanol conversion of 100% and hydrogen yield of 82% (4.9 mol H2/ mol ethanol) at 450 oC , which is superior to 0.5 wt % Rh/Al2O3. The pre-reduction process is required to activate supported cobalt catalysts for high H2 yield of ethanol steam reforming. In addition, support effect is found significant for cobalt during ethanol steam reforming. 10% Co/CeO2 gave high H2 selectivity while suffered low conversion due to the poor thermal stability. In contrast to CeO2, 10 wt % Co/ZrO2 achieved high conversion while suffered lower H2 yield due to the production of methane. The synergistic effect of ZrO2 and CeO2 to promote high ethanol conversion while suppress methanation was observed when CeZrO4 was used as a support for cobalt. This synergistic effect of CeZrO4 support leads to a high hydrogen yield at low temperature for 10 wt % Co/CeZrO4 catalyst. Under the high weight hourly space velocity (WHSV) of ethanol (2.5 h-1), the hydrogen yield over 10 wt % Co/CeZrO4 was found to gradually decrease to 70% of its initial value in 6 hours possibly due to the coke formation on the catalyst.","","","Pacific Northwest National Lab.

WGS activity was found to be dependent on the Pd:Zn ratio with a maximum activity obtained at approximately 0.50, which was comparable to that of a commercial Pt-based catalyst. The catalyst stability was demonstrated for 100 hours time-on-stream at a temperature of 3600C without evidence of metal sintering. WGS reaction rates were approximately 1st order with respect to CO concentration, and kinetic parameters were determined to be Ea = 58.3 kJ mol-1 and k0 = 6.1x107 min-1. During methanol steam reforming, the CO selectivities were observed to be lower than the calculated equilibrium values over a range of temperatures and steam/carbon ratios studied while the reaction rate constants were approximately of the same magnitude for both WGS and methanol steam reforming. These results indicate that although Pd/ZnO/Al2O3 are active WGS catalysts, WGS is not involved in methanol steam reforming. RWGS rate constants are on the order of about 20 times lower than that of methanol steam reforming, suggesting that RWGS reaction could be one of the sources for small amount of CO formation in methanol steam reforming.","","","Pacific Northwest National Lab.

The activation barrier for the most favorable dissociation mode, the O-H bond scission, is 0.3 eV on the (110) surface. An even lower activation barrier (< 0.1 eV) has been obtained on the CeO<sub>2</sub>(111) surface for the same bond-breaking mode. We aslo calculated the pre-exponential factors based on the harmonic approximation and obtained the overall rate constants at 300 and 500 K for all three initial decomposition steps. In contrast to the order of thermodynamic stability, the calculated bond breaking barriers indicated a different bond breaking order kinetically: O-H > C-O > C-H. Our results are consistent with the previous experimental observation that methoxy is the dominant surface species after a stoichiometric CeO<sub>2</sub> surface was exposed to methanol. The experimentally observed methanol chemistry was determined by the kinetics of initial dissociation steps rather than the thermodynamic stability of product states. Surface coverage of methanol was found to affect the relative stability between molecular and dissociative adsorption modes. Dissociative adsorption modes are preferred thermodynamically for methanol coverage up to 0.5 ML but only molecular adsorption was stable at full monolayer coverage.

"CO/FTIR Spectroscopic Characterization of Pd/ZnO/Al2O3 Catalysts for Methanol Steam Reforming","Lebarbier, Vanessa MC; Dagle, Robert A; Conant, Travis; Vohs, John M; Datye, Abhaya K; Wang, Yong","10 SYNTHETIC FUELS; ADSORPTION; ALLOYS; CATALYSTS; METHANOL; MIXTURES; OXYGEN; REPAIR; SPECTROSCOPY; STEAM; FTIR spectroscopy; Pd catalyst; PdZn alloy catalyst; methanol steam reforming; Environmental Molecular Sciences Laboratory","An 8.8% Pd/ZnO/Al2O3 catalyst was either pretreated under O2 at 773 K followed by H2 at 293 K or under H2 at 773 K to obtain, respectively, a supported metallic Pd° catalyst (Pd°/ZnO/Al2O3) or a supported PdZn alloy catalyst (PdZn/ZnO/Al2O3). Both catalysts were studied by CO adsorption using FTIR spectroscopy. For the supported PdZn alloy catalyst (PdZn/ZnO/Al2O3), exposure to a mixture of methanol and steam, simulating methanol steam reforming reaction conditions, does not change the catalyst surface composition. This implies that the active sites are PdZn alloy like structures. The exposure of the catalyst to an oxidizing environment (O2 at 623 K) results in the break up of PdZn alloy, forming a readily reducible PdO with its metallic form being known as much less active and selective for methanol steam reforming. However, for the metallic Pd°/ZnO/Al2O3 catalyst, FTIR results indicate that metallic Pdº can transform to PdZn alloy under methanol steam reforming conditions. These results suggest that PdZn alloy, even after an accidental exposure to oxygen, can self repair to form the active PdZn alloy phase under methanol steam reforming conditions. Catalytic behavior of the PdZn/ZnO/Al2O3 catalyst also correlates well with the surface composition characterizations by FTIR/CO spectroscopy.","","","Pacific Northwest National Lab.

In the regime of interest (higher pressures, lower temperatures), the hydrogen-oxygen chemical induction processes can be significantly perturbed by several nonhomogeneous effects, which include catalytic aberrations. The multiple perturbations that can significantly affect induction chemistry are very difficult to remove in research experiments and nearly impossible to control in engineering applications. The implications for developing lean premixing schemes for advanced syngas gas turbine applications are that designs must consider the inherent presence of these perturbations on ignition delay as well as those that might occur from potential particle contamination of the air stream exiting the compressor, if stimulated flashback into the mixing region is to be precluded.","","Available from: http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.combustflame.2007.08.005","","","","United States","2008-01-15T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: Combustion and Flame; Journal Volume: 152; Journal Issue: 1-2; Other Information: Elsevier Ltd.

The paper does not analyze issues related to the supply of ethanol which may turn out to be of even greater concern. A model of consumers decisions to purchase E85 versus gasoline based on prices, availability, and refueling frequency is derived and preliminary results for 2010, 2017 and 2030 consistent with the President s 2007 biofuels program goals are presented (1). A limited sensitivity analysis is carried out to indicate key uncertainties in the trade-off between the number of stations and fuels. The analysis indicates that to meet a 2017 goal of 26 billion gallons of E85 sold, on the order of 30% to 80% of all stations may need to offer E85, and that 125 to 200 million flexible fuel vehicles (FFVs) may need to be on the road, even if oil prices remain high. These conclusions are tentative for three reasons: (1) there is considerable uncertainty about key parameter values, such as the price elasticity of choice between E85 and gasoline, (2) the future prices of E85 and gasoline are uncertain; and (3) the method of analysis used is highly aggregated; it does not consider the potential benefits of regional strategies nor the possible existence of market segments predisposed to purchase E85. Nonetheless, the preliminary results indicate that the 2017 biofuels program goals are ambitious and will require a massive effort to produce FFVs and insure widespread availability of E85.","","","Oak Ridge National Lab.

Only analytes that have a single pK{sub a} are considered. In the buffer mobile phase used for their elution, their dissociation may, under certain conditions, cause a significant pH perturbation during the passage of the band. Two consecutive injections (3.3 and 10 {micro}L) of each one of three sample solutions (0.5, 5, and 50 mM) of ten compounds were injected on five C{sub 18}-bonded packing materials, including the 5 {micro}m Xterra-C{sub 18} (121 {angstrom}), 5 {micro}m Gemini-C{sub 18} (110 {angstrom}), 5 {micro}m Luna-C{sub 18}(2) (93 {angstrom}), 3.5 {micro}m Extend-C{sub 18} (80 {angstrom}), and 2.7 {micro}m Halo-C{sub 18} (90 {angstrom}). The mobile phase was an aqueous solution of methanol buffered at a constant {sub W}{sup W}pH of 6, with a phosphate buffer. The total concentration of the phosphate groups was constant at 50 mM. The methanol concentration was adjusted to keep all the retention factors between 1 and 10. The compounds injected were phenol, caffeine, 3-phenyl 1-propanol, 2-phenyl butyric acid, amphetamine, aniline, benzylamine, p-toluidine, procainamidium chloride, and propranololium chloride. Depending on the relative values of the analyte pK{sub a} and the buffer solution pH, these analytes elute as the neutral, the cationic, or the anionic species. The influence of structural parameters such as the charge, the size, and the hydrophobicity of the analytes on the shape of its overloaded band profile is discussed. Simple but general rules predict these shapes. An original adsorption model is proposed that accounts for the unusual peak shapes observed when the analyte is partially dissociated in the buffer solution during its elution.","","","Oak Ridge National Lab.

Its structure has been thoroughly investigated using different characterization techniques, including N2-physisorption, X-ray diffraction, transmission electron microscopy (TEM), Raman spectroscopy, H2 temperature-programmed reduction, X-ray absorption near-edge structure (XANES), and extended X-ray absorption fine structure (EXAFS). The spectroscopic results revealed that under dehydrated conditions, the grafted vanadium domains are highly dispersed on the SBA-15 surface, composed predominately of isolated VO4 units with distorted tetrahedral coordination. The suggested ({triple_bond}SiO)3V{double_bond}O sites on the silica surface include one short bond ({approx}1.54 Angstroms) and three long bonds (1.74 Angstroms). Methanol oxidation was used as a chemical probe reaction to examine the catalytic properties of these catalysts. At low vanadium loading, the vanadium species grafted on the surface show structural properties similar to those of vanadium-incorporated MCM-41 catalyst. However, the present mesoporous V-SBA-15 catalysts in the oxidation of methanol to formaldehyde show remarkable catalytic performance compared with that of VOx/SBA-15 catalysts synthesized through a conventional wet impregnation method, which has been attributed to the homogeneous dispersion and uniformity of the catalytic vanadium species achieved on the SBA-15 support with large pore diameter and surface area. The acidic properties of V-SBA-15 was investigated by pyridine temperature-programmed desorption, which indicated the existence of both Lewis and Broensted acid sites of the surface.","","","Brookhaven National Lab.

The nature of the pMMO active site and the overall metal content are controversial, with spectroscopic and crystallographic data suggesting the presence of a mononuclear copper center, a dinuclear copper center, a trinuclear center, and a diiron center or combinations thereof. Most studies have focused on pMMO from Methylococcus capsulatus (Bath). pMMO from a second organism, Methylosinus trichosporium OB3b, has been purified and characterized by spectroscopic and crystallographic methods. Purified M. trichosporium OB3b pMMO contains 2 copper ions per 100 kDa protomer. Electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR) spectroscopic parameters indicate that type 2 Cu(II) is present as two distinct species. Extended X-ray absorption fine structure (EXAFS) data are best fit with oxygen/nitrogen ligands and reveal a Cu-Cu interaction at 2.52 Angstroms. Correspondingly, X-ray crystallography of M. trichosporium OB3b pMMO shows a dinuclear copper center, similar to that observed previously in the crystal structure of M. capsulatus (Bath) pMMO. There are, however, significant differences between the pMMO structures from the two organisms. A mononuclear copper center present in M. capsulatus (Bath) pMMO is absent in M. trichosporium OB3b pMMO, whereas a metal center occupied by zinc in the M. capsulatus (Bath) pMMO structure is occupied by copper in M. trichosporium OB3b pMMO. These findings extend previous work on pMMO from M. capsulatus (Bath) and provide new insight into the functional importance of the different metal centers.","","","Brookhaven National Lab.

We investigate the influence of the detailed electronic structure of the Ce 4f band on the chemistry of methanol on the surface. For the partially reduced surface we obtain a spin delocalized, a ferromagnetic, and an anti-ferromagnetic solution. We find that the qualitative conclusions are independent of the surface type used. Methanol adsorption is exothermic on the fully oxidized as well as on the partially reduced surface. Also dissociation of methanol on the surface is exothermic but strongly enhanced by the presence of a vacancy. We localize an on-top methoxy species as a dissociation product on the fully oxidized surface and a triply bridged methoxy species on the partially reduced surface where the methoxy oxygen partly fills the oxygen vacancy in the surface. Adsorption energies are influenced by the introduction of the repulsive Hubbard (U) term.

Motivations for studying these compounds are their promising unique scintillation properties for radiation detection applications and the model structural systems they provide for the realization of new low-dimensional quantum magnets.

Similar to high-temperature-mixed-conductive perovskite oxides at high temperatures (such as SrCe0.95Yb0.05O3-x, La0.9Sr0.1Ga0.8Mg0.2O3-x at 600-1000oC), Sn0.9In0.1P2O7 can conduct both protons and oxide-ions at low temperatures (130-230oC). The conductivity of Sn0.9In0.1P2O7 reaches 0.019 S/cm at 200oC in wet nitrogen. Its transport numbers determined by steam concentration cells are about 0.8 for proton and 0.1 for oxide-ion. The performance at 170oC for methanol fuel cells using mixed-ion conductive Sn0.9In0.1P2O7 as the electrolyte is higher than that at 235oC using pure proton conductive CsH2PO4 electrolyte.

Each side chain had four EG repeat units and the DP of the polystyrene backbone was varied from 8 to 85. The global conformation of the polymers in toluene and methanol was shown to assume ellipsoidal, cylindrical or worm-like chain morphologies with increasing DP of the polystyrene backbone. At the same time, in D2O, the polymer conformation was described by the form factor of rigid cylinders. The second viral coefficient was measured for the polymer with a DP of 85 in all three solvents and the solvent quality of toluene, methanol and D2O was identified as good, marginal and poor for this polymer. Due to a poor solvent quality, the PS backbone (DP = 85) is partially collapsed in D2O whereas it is moderately expanded in toluene and methanol. Polymers with the DP of 8 were found to aggregate into clusters in all three solvents, with the characteristic size between 100 and 200 ?and a fractal dimension of 2. With increase of the DP, the clusters diminished in D2O and completely disappeared in toluene and methanol. This observation suggests that the clusterization of these short side-chain polymers is caused by end group and hydrogen bonding interactions between different chains.","","","Oak Ridge National Lab.

The films are then heated and temperature programmed desorption (TPD) and FTIR spectroscopy are used to observe the mixing, desorption, and crystallization behavior from the initially unmixed amorphous layers. We find that after heating above Tg, the layers completely intermix to form a deeply supercooled liquid solution. Modeling of the desorption kinetics shows that the supercooled liquid films behave as ideal solutions. Deviations from ideal solution desorption behavior are observed when the metastable supercooled solution remains for longer times in regions of the phase diagram where crystallization is thermodynamically favorable. In those cases, the finite lifetime of the metastable solutions results in the precipitation of crystalline solids. Finally, in very thick films at temperatures and compositions where a stable liquid should exist, we unexpectedly observe deviations from ideal solution behavior. Visual inspection of the sample indicates that these apparent departures from ideality arise from dewetting of the liquid film from the substrate. We conclude that compositionally tailored nanoscale amorphous films provide a useful means for preparing and examining deeply-supercooled solutions in metastable regions of the phase diagram.","","","Pacific Northwest National Lab.

Methanol is an excellent liquid-hydrogen-transport medium. When powered by hydrogen, fuel cells have the potential to be the cleanest and most efficient source of electricity for use by the automotive industry. On-board reforming of liquid hydrocarbon fuels is a viable alternative to the storage of compressed hydrogen. A problem in current reforming processes is the quantity of carbon monoxide (CO) produced. Our research is geared toward circumventing the production of carbon monoxide in methanol reforming through the development of novel reforming catalysts. By modifying a copper-based catalyst, we have produced several catalysts that retain their activity and high surface area after extended methanol reforming runs both with and without the addition of steam.","American Chemical Society","Publisher","National Energy Technology Laboratory (NETL), Pittsburgh, PA, Morgantown, WV, and Albany, OR (United States)","USDOE - Office of Fossil Energy (FE)","","United States","2007-12-19T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: Industrial and Engineering Chemistry Research; Journal Volume: 46; Journal Issue: 26","","Medium: X; Size: 8906-8909","","DOE/NETL-IR-2008-064","None cited","Journal ID: ISSN 0888-5885; TRN: US200805%%75","10.1021/ie061307v","","2018-10-12T00:00:00Z","923842","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/923842","","Industrial and Engineering Chemistry Research","26","46"

Coal, biomass and other carbonaceous materials can be converted to liquid fuels using several conversion processes. The leading candidate for large-scale conversion of coal to liquid fuels is the Fischer Tropsch (FT) process. Process configuration, component selection, and performance are interrelated and dependent on feed characteristics. This paper outlines a flexible modular approach to model an integrated FT process that utilizes a library of key component models, supporting kinetic data and materials and transport properties allowing rapid development of custom integrated plant models. The modular construction will permit rapid assessment of alternative designs and feed stocks. The modeling approach consists of three thrust areas, or “strands” – model/module development, integration of the model elements into an end to end integrated system model, and utilization of the model for plant design. Strand 1, model/module development, entails identifying, developing, and assembling a library of codes, user blocks, and data for FT process unit operations for a custom feedstock and plant description. Strand 2, integration development, provides the framework for linking these component and subsystem models to form an integrated FT plant simulation. Strand 3, plant design, includes testing and validation of the comprehensive model and performing design evaluation analyses.","","","Idaho National Lab.

We describe a methodology to characterize the underside of the films as revealed by sacrificial etching of the underlying substrate. This enables the study of the morphology and composition resulting from the nucleation and initial growth of the films, as well as the characterization of nanotribological properties which are relevant for applications including micro-/nanoelectromechanical systems. We study the surface chemistry, bonding configuration, and nanotribological properties of both the topside and the underside of the film with synchrotron-based x-ray absorption near-edge structure spectroscopy to identify the bonding state of the carbon atoms, x-ray photoelectron spectroscopy to determine the surface chemical composition, Auger electron spectroscopy to further verify the composition and bonding configuration, and quantitative atomic force microscopy to study the nanoscale topography and nanotribological properties. The films were grown on SiO{sub 2} after mechanically polishing the surface with detonation synthesized nanodiamond powder, followed by ultrasonication in a methanol solution containing additional nanodiamond powder. The sp{sup 2} fraction, morphology, and chemistry of the as-etched underside are distinct from the topside, exhibiting a higher sp{sup 2} fraction, some oxidized carbon, and a smoother morphology. The nanoscale single-asperity work of adhesion between a diamond nanotip and the as-etched UNCD underside is far lower than for a silicon-silicon interface (59.2 {+-} 2 vs 826 {+-} 186 mJ/m{sup 2}, respectively). Exposure to atomic hydrogen dramatically reduces nanoscale adhesion to 10.2 {+-} 0.4 mJ/m{sup 2}, at the level of van der Waals interactions and consistent with recent ab initio calculations. Friction is substantially reduced as well, demonstrating a direct link between the surface chemistry and nanoscale friction. The proposed mechanism, supported by the detailed surface spectroscopic analysis, is the elimination of reactive (e.g., C*-), polar (e.g., C-O), and {pi}-bonded (C-C) surface groups, which are replaced by fully saturated, hydrogen-terminated surface bonds to produce an inert surface that interacts minimally with the contacting counterface.","","","Argonne National Lab.

Both Pd loading and reduction temperature (>350ºC) were used to vary the crystallite size of PdZn alloy.

At 0.25 monolayer (ML) coverage, the dissociative adsorption with an adsorption energy of 0.55 eV is slightly favored. The most stable state is the dissociative adsorption of methanol via C-H bond breaking, forming a coadsorbed hydroxymethyl group and hydrogen adatom on two separate O₃C surface sites. The strongest molecular adsorption occurs through an O-Ce₇subC connection with an adsorption energy of 0.48 eV. At methanol coverage of 0.5 ML, the dissociative adsorption and the molecular adsorption became competitive. The adsorption energy per methanol molecule for both adsorption modes falls into a narrow range of 0.46-0.55 eV. As methanol coverage increases beyond 0.5 ML, the molecular adsorption becomes more energetically favorable than the dissociative adsorption because of the attractive hydrogen bonding between coadsorbed methanol molecules. At full monolayer, the adsorption energy of molecular adsorption is 0.40 eV per molecule while the adsorption energy for total dissociative adsorption of methanol is only 0.17 eV. The results at different methanol coverages indicate that methanol can adsorb on a defect-free CeO₂(111) surface, which are also consistent with experimental observations.

For liquids, the surface of which is plagued with hydrophobic groups (such as methanol), the surface ion effect all but disappears. Based on the present data, a general picture of inorganic ion solvation at the solution/vapor interface of polar liquids is outlined.

This improvement allowed the activation to be performed at a much lower temperature, thus greatly mitigating the danger of reducing the copper ions. A review of the literature for H2 adsorption in CuBTC shows that the preparation and activation process has a significant impact on the adsorption capacity, surface area, and pore volume. CuBTC-MeOH exhibits a larger pore volume and H2 adsorption amount than any previously reported results for CuBTC. We have performed atomically detailed modeling to complement experimentally measured isotherms. Quantum effects for hydrogen adsorption in CuBTC were found to be important at 77 K. Simulations that include quantum effects are in good agreement with the experimentally measured capacity for H2 at 77 K and high pressure. However, simulations underpredict the amount adsorbed at low pressures. We have compared the adsorption isotherms from simulations with experiments for H2 adsorption at 77, 87, 175, and 298 K; nitrogen adsorption at 253 and 298 K; and argon adsorption at 298 and 356 K.

Raman, XANES, and EXAFS were used to characterize the V-MCM-48 sample, prepared with a loading of 0.3 V/nm{sup 2}, and it is concluded that the oxidized form of the vanadium is isolated VO{sub 4} units. The VO{sub 4} species consist of one V=O bond and three V-O-Si bonds in a distorted tetrahedral geometry. Methanol reacts reversibly, at a ratio of approximately 1 methanol per V, with one V-O-Si to produce both V-OCH{sub 3}/Si-OH and V-OH/Si-OCH{sub 3} group pairs in roughly equivalent concentrations. Formaldehyde is formed from the methyl group of V-OCH{sub 3}, most likely by the transfer of one H atom to the V=O bond of the vanadium containing the methoxide group. Formaldehyde is formed in nearly equal concentrations both in the presence and in the absence of gas-phase oxygen. CO and H{sub 2} are produced by the decomposition of CH{sub 2}O at higher temperature. In the absence of O{sub 2}, Si-OCH{sub 3} groups undergo hydrogenation to form CH{sub 4}, and in the presence of O{sub 2}, these groups are oxidized to COx (x = 1, 2) and H{sub 2}O above 650 K. Under steady-state reaction conditions, CH{sub 2}O is produced as the dominant product of methanol oxidation at temperatures below 650 K with an apparent activation energy of 23 kcal/mol. Schemes for the product flows during both TPD and TPO experiments, along with proposed surface intermediates, are presented.","","","SLAC National Accelerator Lab., Menlo Park, CA (United States)","USDOE","","United States","2007-07-03T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: J.Phys.Chem.C111:420-430,2007; Journal Volume: 111; Journal Issue: 1","","Medium: X","","SLAC-REPRINT-2007-057","AC02-76SF00515","TRN: US200722%%1326","10.1021/jp0653149","","2016-05-30T00:00:00Z","909558","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/909558","","J.Phys.Chem.C111:420-430,2007","1","111"

Virtually all of the ethanol used for transportation has been produced from corn. During the period of fuel ethanol growth, corn farming productivity has increased dramatically, and energy use in ethanol plants has been reduced by almost by half. The majority of corn ethanol plants are powered by natural gas. However, as natural gas prices have skyrocketed over the last several years, efforts have been made to further reduce the energy used in ethanol plants or to switch from natural gas to other fuels, such as coal and wood chips. In this paper, we examine nine corn ethanol plant types--categorized according to the type of process fuels employed, use of combined heat and power, and production of wet distiller grains and solubles. We found that these ethanol plant types can have distinctly different energy and greenhouse gas emission effects on a full fuel-cycle basis. In particular, greenhouse gas emission impacts can vary significantly--from a 3% increase if coal is the process fuel to a 52% reduction if wood chips are used. Our results show that, in order to achieve energy and greenhouse gas emission benefits, researchers need to closely examine and differentiate among the types of plants used to produce corn ethanol so that corn ethanol production would move towards a more sustainable path.","","","Argonne National Lab.

The Ni-MCM-41 catalysts containing 1-3 wt% Ni were prepared by incorporating the Ni ions into the framework of siliceous MCM-41 with the procedure developed in our previous work. Pretreatment using pure H2 at different temperatures affected the reactivity. Pretreatment at 973 K for 0.5 h was the best among the conditions tested. At this temperature, the Ni was mostly reduced but remained highly dispersed. Significant selectivity to methane (85.1%) was obtained with 1 wt% Ni-MCM-41 at a reaction temperature as low as 573 K and gas hourly space velocity (GHSV) of 5760 l kg?1 h?1 under atmospheric pressure. Higher selectivity (96.0%) and space-time yield (91.4 g kg?1 h?1) were achieved with higher Ni loading catalysts (3 wt% Ni) at the same space velocity. This selectivity was maintained at higher temperature (673 K) with increased space-time yield (633 g kg?1 h?1). The X-ray absorption result demonstrates that the Ni particle size does not significantly change during reaction.","","","Brookhaven National Lab. (BNL), Upton, NY (United States).

The mechanism by which ROH model reagents are activated on the surface of the Pt/partially reduced ceria catalyst was explored using a combination of reaction testing and infrared spectroscopy. In this particular investigation, the activation and turnover of ethanol were explored and compared with previous investigations of methanol steam reforming and low-temperature water-gas shift under H2-rich conditions, where the surface of ceria is in a partially reduced state. Under these conditions, activation of ethanol was found to proceed by dissociative adsorption at reduced defect sites on ceria (i.e., Ce surface atoms in the Ce3+ oxidation state), yielding an adsorbed type II ethoxy species and an adsorbed H species, the latter identified to be a type II bridging OH group. In the presence of steam, the ethoxy species rapidly undergoes molecular transformation to an adsorbed acetate intermediate by oxidative dehydrogenation. This is analogous to the conversion of type II methoxy species to formate observed in previous investigations of methanol steam reforming. In addition, although formate then decomposes in steam to CO2 and H2 during methanol steam reforming, in an analogous pathway for ethanol steam reforming, the acetate intermediate decomposes in steam to CO2 and CH4. Therefore, further H2 production requires energy-intensive activation of CH4, which is not required for methanol conversion over Pt/ceria.","","","Brookhaven National Lab.

The daunting prospect of complete nitrate removal prior to the reduction of uranium provides a strong incentive to explore bioremediation strategies that allow for uranium bioreduction and stabilization in the presence of nitrate. Typical in-situ strategies involving the stimulation of metal-reducing bacteria are hindered by low pH environments at this study site and require that the persistent nitrate must first and continuously be removed or transformed prior to uranium being a preferred electron acceptor. This project investigates the possibility of stimulating nitrate-indifferent, pH-tolerant microorganisms to achieve bioreduction of U(VI) despite nitrate persistence. Successful enrichments from U-contaminated sediments demonstrated nearly complete reduction of uranium with very little loss of nitrate from pH 4.9-5.6 using methanol or glycerol as a carbon source. Higher pH enrichments also demonstrated similar U reduction capacity with 5-30% nitrate loss within one week. Bacterial 16S rRNA genes were amplified from uranium-reducing enrichments (pH 5.7-6.7) and sequenced. Phylogenetic analyses classified the clone sequences into four distinct clusters. Data from sequencing and T-RFLP profiles indicated that the majority of the microorganisms stimulated by these enrichment conditions consisted of low G+C Gram-positive bacteria most closely related to Clostridium and Clostridium-like organisms. This research demonstrates that the stimulation of a natural microbial community to immobilize U through bioreduction is possible without the removal of nitrate.","","","Oak Ridge National Lab.

Thermochemical parameters of three C₂H₅O<sup>•</sup> radicals derived from ethanol were reevaluated using coupledcluster theory CCSD(T) calculations, with the aug-cc-pVnZ (n = D, T, Q) basis sets, that allow the CC energies to be extrapolated at the CBS limit. Theoretical results obtained for methanol and two CH₃O<sup>•</sup> radicals were found to agree within ±0.5 kcal/mol with the experiment values. A set of consistent values was determined for ethanol and its radicals: (a) heats of formation (298 K) ΔHf(C₂H₅OH) = -56.4 ±0.8 kcal/mol (exptl: -56.21 ± 0.12 kcal/mol), ΔH<sub>f</sub>(CH₃C<sup>•</sup>HOH) = -13.1 ±0.8 kcal/mol, ΔH<sub>f</sub>(C<sup>•</sup>H₂CH₂OH) = -6.2 ±0.8 kcal/mol, and ΔHf(CH₃CH₂O<sup>•</sup>) = -2.7 ± 0.8 kcal/mol; (b) bond dissociation energies (BDEs) of ethanol (0 K) BDE(CH₃CHOH-H) = 93.9 ± 0.8 kcal/mol, BDE(CH₂CH₂OH-H) = 100.6 ± 0.8 kcal/mol, and BDE- (CH₃CH₂O-H) = 104.5 ± 0.8 kcal/mol. The present results support the experimental ionization energies and electron affinities of the radicals, and appearance energy of (CH₃CHOH+) cation. β-C-C bond scission in the ethoxy radical, CH₃CH₂O<sup>•</sup>, leading to the formation of C<sup>•</sup>H₃ and CH₂=O, is characterized by a C-C bond energy of 9.6 kcal/mol at 0 K, a zero-point-corrected energy barrier of E0 ‡ = 17.2 kcal/mol, an activation energy of Ea = 18.0 kcal/mol and a high-pressure thermal rate coefficient of kω(298 K) = 3.9 s<sup>-1</sup>, including a tunneling correction. The latter value is in excellent agreement with the value of 5.2 s<sup>-1</sup> from the most recent experimental kinetic data. Using RRKM theory, we obtain a general rate expression of k(T,p) = 1.26 x 10<sup>9</sup>p0.793 exp(-15.5/RT) s<sup>-1</sup> in the temperature range (T) from 198 to 1998 K and pressure range (p) from 0.1 to 8360.1 Torr with N₂ as the collision partners, where k(298 K, 760 Torr) = 2.7 s<sup>-1</sup>, without tunneling and k = 3.2 s<sup>-1</sup> with the tunneling correction. Evidence is provided that heavy atom tunneling can play a role in the rate constant for β-C-C bond scission in alkoxy radicals.","American Chemical Society","","Pacific Northwest National Lab.

We report and discuss the results of the EXAFS spectra, Debye-Waller factors and the related properties governing solvation processes of different ions in water, as well as in different solvents (methanol). Molecular dynamics (MD) trajectories are coupled to electron scattering simulations to generate the EXAFS spectra, which are found to be in very good agreement with the corresponding experimental measurements. From these spectra, both the ion-oxygen and the ion-hydrogen distances for the first hydration shell are predicted to be within 0.1-0.2 Å. The ionic species studied range from monovalent to divalent, positive and negative: K+, Ca2+ and Cl-. This work demonstrates that the combination of MD-EXAFS and the corresponding experiment measurement provides a powerful tool in the analysis of the solvation structure of aqueous ionic solutions. We also investigate the value of electronic structure analysis of small aqueous clusters as a benchmark to the empirical potentials. In a novel computational approach, we compute the Debye-Waller factors combining a harmonic analysis of data obtained from electronic structure calculations on finite ionwater clusters, and we present a direct comparison with results from a harmonic classical statistical mechanical analysis of an empirical potential.

"On the mechanisms and behavior of coal syngas transport and reaction within the anode of a solid oxide fuel cell","Gemmen, R S; Trembly, J P","30 DIRECT ENERGY CONVERSION; 10 SYNTHETIC FUELS; Syngas; Coal; Solid oxide; Fuel cell; Anode; Model","It is expected that in future years high temperature fuel cells will be coupled with coal gasification technology to produce electric power, as well as other valuable commercial products. Numerous technical investigations have already shown the feasibility of such systems at the system level as well as in the details of fuel cell operation. This paper focuses on the operation of an anode comprised of conventional solid oxide fuel cell anode materials (Ni/YSZ cermets) when operating on coal syngas. A model is presented for the transport of gases through the anode, as well as gas specie reactions within the anode consisting of methane reforming and water-gas shift. The model is validated by making comparisons to data and other models from the literature. The model is then employed to analyze transport performance within the anode over operating pressures between 1 and 15 atm. Results show the pressure effects on specie profiles, diffusion losses, and cell heating. Specifically, there is a maximum pressure (8 atm) under which hydrogen is produced by the methane-steam reaction; operating at higher pressure will produce methane. In addition, the concentration overpotential decreases as pressure increases from 1 to 5 atm after which it again increases. Finally, the model predicts a significant amount of heating due to the net reforming and water-gas shift reactions that should be considered by developers of these future systems.","Elsevier B.V.","Publisher","National Energy Technology Laboratory (NETL), Pittsburgh, PA, Morgantown, WV, and Albany, OR (United States)","USDOE - Office of Fossil Energy (FE)","","United States","2006-10-27T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: Journal of Power Sources; Journal Volume: 161; Journal Issue: 2","","Medium: X; Size: 1084-1095","","DOE/NETL-IR-2007-208","None cited","Journal ID: ISSN 0378-7753","10.1016/j.jpowsour.2006.06.012","","2018-10-12T00:00:00Z","916953","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/916953","","Journal of Power Sources","2","161"
"Examination of the oxidation behavior of biodiesel soot","Song, Juhun; Alam, Mahabubul; Boehman, Andre L; Kim, Unjeong","09 BIOMASS FUELS; 10 SYNTHETIC FUELS; SOOT; OXIDATION; BIOFUELS; DIESEL FUELS; COMBUSTION KINETICS","In this work, we expand upon past work relating the nanostructure and oxidative reactivity of soot. This work shows that the initial structure alone does not dictate the reactivity of diesel soot and rather the initial oxygen groups have a strong influence on the oxidation rate. A comparison of the complete oxidation behavior and burning mode was made to address the mechanism by which biodiesel soot enhances oxidation. Diesel soot derived from neat biodiesel (B100) is far more reactive during oxidation than soot from neat Fischer-Tropsch diesel fuel (FT100). B100 soot undergoes a unique oxidation process leading to capsule-type oxidation and eventual formation of graphene ribbon structures. The results presented here demonstrate the importance of initial properties of the soot, which lead to differences in burning mode. Incorporation of greater surface oxygen functionality in the B100 soot provides the means for more rapid oxidation and drastic structural transformation during the oxidation process.

The results of the measurements were interpreted successively on the basis of the linear (i.e., overall retention factors) and the nonlinear (i.e., adsorption isotherms, surface heterogeneity, saturation capacities, and equilibrium constants) chromatographic methods. The confrontation of these two approaches confirmed the impossibility of a sound physical interpretation of the conventional Van't Hoff plot. The classical linear chromatography theory assumes that retention is determined by the equilibrium thermodynamics of analytes between a homogeneous stationary phase and a homogeneous mobile phase (although there may be two or several types of interactions). From values of the experimental retention factors in a temperature interval and estimates of the activity coefficients at infinite dilution in the same temperature interval provided by the UNIFAC group contribution method, evidence is provided that such a retention model cannot hold. The classical Van't Hoff plot appears meaningless and its linear behavior a mere accident. Results from nonlinear chromatography confirm these conclusions and provide explanations. The retention factors seem to fulfill the Van't Hoff equation, not the Henry constants corresponding to the different types of adsorption sites. The saturation capacities and the adsorption energies are clearly temperature dependent. The temperature dependence of these characteristics of the different assorption sites are different in aqueous methanol and acetonitrile solutions.","","","Oak Ridge National Lab.

The same surface ionic behavior is also derived from molecular dynamics (MD) simulations of the corresponding aqueous salt solutions. The MIES results provide first direct evidence for the suggested presence of heavier halides (iodide, bromide, and to a lesser extent chloride) at aqueous surfaces, and confirm the structural similarity between the amorphous solid and the corresponding liquid. In contrast, no appreciable surface segregation of ions is observed in methanol, neither in the experiment nor in the simulation, which points to the remarkable surface properties of water among polar solvents. The propensity of heavier halides for the air/solution interface has important implications for heterogeneous chemical processes, particularly on aqueous aerosols in the atmosphere.

While submechanisms for hydrogen and carbon monoxide are essential components of this mechanism, thorough testing of the predictions of the mechanism for these simpler fuels has not been performed recently.

A method for calculating and subsequently tuning the electrochemical potential of a half cell using periodic plane-wave density functional theory and a homogenous counter-charge is presented and evaluated by comparison to simulations which explicitly model the countercharge by a plane of ions. The method involves the establishment of two reference potentials, one related to the potential of the free electron in vacuo, and the other related to the potential of H₂O species far from the electrode. The surface potential can be specifically adjusted by the explicit introduction of excess or deficit surface charges in the simulation cell and the application of periodic boundary conditions. We demonstrate the absence of field emission from the electrode over the range of realistic electrochemical potentials covered and confirm that the method can explicitly determine reaction energies and adsorption geometries as a function of electrochemical potential. This latter point is most useful as it asserts the viability of this method to model electrochemical and electrocatalytical systems of academic as well as applied interest. We present two case studies. The first examines the changes in the structure of water at the metal interface as a function of potential over Cu(111). At cathodic potential, we observe the repulsion of H₂O from the interface and the rotation of the water dipole toward the interface. The second study follows the initial pathways for the electrocatalytical activation of methanol over Pt(111) and the corresponding potential dependent reaction energetics for these paths. The results demonstrate that changes in the electrochemical potential can significantly alter the reaction energetics as well as the overall reaction selectivity. While the case studies presented herein described equilibrium geometries (i.e., the ideal forms at zero kelvin), the method is also suitable for application to ensembles of thermally activated systems.","","","Pacific Northwest National Lab.

A microkinetic model for methanol decomposition on platinum is presented. The model incorporates competitive decomposition pathways, beginning with both O–H and C–H bond scission in methanol, and uses results from density functional theory (DFT) calculations [Greeley and Mavrikakis, J. Am. Chem. Soc. 124 (2002) 7193, Greeley and Mavrikakis, J. Am. Chem. Soc. 126 (2004) 3910]. Results from reaction kinetics experiments show that the rate of H2 production increases with increasing temperature and methanol concentration in the feed and is only nominally affected by the presence of CO or H2 with methanol. The model, based on the values of binding energies, pre-exponential factors and activation energy barriers derived from first principles calculations, accurately predicts experimental reaction rates and orders. The model also gives insight into the most favorable reaction pathway, the rate-limiting step, the apparent activation energy, coverages, and the effects of pressure. It is found that the pathway beginning with the C–H bond scission (CH3OH→H2COH→HCOH→CO) is dominant compared with the path beginning with O–H bond scission. The cleavage of the first C–H bond in methanol is the rate-controlling step. The surface is highly poisoned by CO, whereas COH appears to be a spectator species.","","","Pacific Northwest National Lab. (PNNL), Richland, WA (United States).

Measurements have been performed on poly(amidoamine) dendrimers with generations ranging from g = 0 up to g = 8 at low concentrations in methanol. We described the static form factor P(q) by a model taking into account the compact, globular shape as well as the loose, polymeric character of dendrimers. Monomer distributions within dendrimers are of special interest for potential applications and have been characterized by the pair correlation function {gamma}(r), as well as by the monomer and end-group density profile, {rho}(r) and {rho}{sub e}(r), respectively. Monomer density profiles and {gamma}(r) can be derived from P(q) by modeling and via a model independent approach using the inverse Fourier transformation algorithm first introduced by Glatter. Experimental results are compared with computer simulations performed for single dendrimers of various generations using the cooperative motion algorithm. The simulation gives direct access to {gamma}(r) and {rho}(r), allows an independent determination of P(q), and yields in addition to the scattering experiment information about the distribution of the end groups.

Most of these isotherms have two inflection points and three different parts. The low and the high concentration parts exhibit langmuirian behavior. The intermediate part exhibits anti-langmuirian behavior. The inflection points shift toward higher concentrations with increasing mobile phase concentration in ACN or MeOH, which causes the differences in the isotherm profiles. The nature of the organic modifier and its concentration affect only the isotherm profile and the numerical values of its parameters, not the nature of the best model, which is the bi-Moreau model in all cases. The isotherm profiles depend on the experimental conditions because they affect the intensity of the adsorbate-adsorbate interactions. Overloaded band profiles of tryptophan were recorded with the seven mobile phase compositions. They were used to determine the best values of the isotherm coefficients by the inverse method (IM) of chromatography. There is an excellent agreement between the values of these parameters obtained by FA and by IM. Increasing the concentration of either ACN or MeOH in the mobile phase causes a slight decrease in the saturation capacities of the low and the high energy sites, and in the adsorption constant of the low energy sites. The adsorption constant of the high energy sites increases with increasing concentration of either solvent or is little affected. The adsorbate-adsorbate interaction constants of both low and high energy sites increase for both solvents.

"Extension of Toth function from gas-solid to liquid-solid equilibria and application to reversed-phase liquid chromatography systems","Gritti, Fabrice; Guiochon, Georges A","10 SYNTHETIC FUELS; ACETONITRILE; ADSORBENTS; ADSORPTION; AQUEOUS SOLUTIONS; BONDING; CHAINS; CHROMATOGRAPHY; DISTURBANCES; FREE ENERGY; METHANOL; ORGANIC SOLVENTS; PHENOL; PROBES; REACTION KINETICS; SILICA; SILICA GEL; THERMODYNAMIC ACTIVITY; liquid-solid equilibrium; integral isotherm equations; Gibbs equation; free energy of the surface; reversed-phase liquid chromatography; adsorption isotherms; measured isotherms; frontal analysis; minor disturbance method; methanol-water liquid phase","The extension of the {Psi} function developed by Toth from equilibria taking place at gas-solid interfaces to those taking place at liquid-solid interfaces was investigated. The results were applied to conventional liquid-solid systems used in reversed-phase liquid chromatography (RPLC). The adsorbents in these systems are made of porous silica having a hydrophobic solid surface obtained by chemically bonding C{sub 18} alkyl chains to a porous silica gel then endcapping the surface with trimethylsilyl groups. The liquid is an aqueous solution of an organic solvent, most often methanol or acetonitrile. The probe compound used here is phenol. Adsorption data of phenol were measured using the dynamic frontal analysis (FA) method. The excess adsorption of the organic solvent was measured using the minor disturbance (MD) method. Activity coefficients in the bulk were estimated through the UNIFAC group contributions. The results show that the {Psi} function predicts 90% of the total free energy of immersion, {Delta}F, of the solid when the concentration of phenol is moderate (typically less than 10 g/L). At higher concentrations, the nonideal behavior of the bulk liquid phase becomes significant and it may contribute up to about 30% of {Delta}F. The high concentration of adsorbed molecules of phenol at the interface decreases the interfacial tension, {sigma}, by about 18 mN/m, independently of the structure of the adsorbed phase and of the nature of the organic solvent.","","","Oak Ridge National Lab.

Emphasis was placed on examination of excitation conditions in which the droplet was situated (1) at or near a velocity antinode (pressure node), where the droplet experienced the greatest effects of velocity perturbations, or (2) at a velocity node (pressure antinode), where the droplet was exposed to minimal velocity fluctuations. Acoustic excitation had a significantly greater influence on droplet-burning rates and flame structures in microgravity than in normal gravity. In normal gravity, acoustic excitation of droplets situated near a pressure node produced only very moderate increases in burning rate (about 11-15% higher than for nonacoustically excited, burning droplets) and produced no significant change in burning rate near a pressure antinode. In microgravity, for the same range in sound pressure level, droplet burning rates increased by over 75 and 200% for droplets situated at or near pressure antinode and pressure node locations, respectively. Observed flame deformation for droplets situated near pressure nodes or antinodes were generally consistent with the notion of acoustic radiation forces arising in connection with acoustic streaming, yet both velocity and pressure perturbations were seen to affect flame behavior, even when the droplet was situated precisely at or extremely close to node or antinode locations. Displacements of the droplet with respect to node or antinode locations were observed to have a measureable effect on droplet burning rates, yet acoustic accelerations associated with such displacements, as an analogy to gravitational acceleration, did not completely explain the significant increases in burning rate resulting from the excitation.","","Available from doi: http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.combustflame.2005.07.013","","","","United States","2006-01-01T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: Combustion and Flame; Journal Volume: 144; Journal Issue: 1-2; Other Information: Elsevier Ltd.

Gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC-MS) analyses using a five-component volatiles mixture in methanol injected directly into a capture pad indicated that compound release could be detected initially and three days after time of collection. Additionally, fifteen compounds of a 39-component toxic organics gaseous mixture (10-1,000 ppbv) were trapped, released, and detected in the headspace of a volatiles capture pad after being exposed to this mixture using the STU-100 with analysis via GC-MS. Component release efficiencies at ambient temperature varied with the analyte; however, typical values of approximately 10 percent were obtained. Desorption at elevated temperatures of reported human odor/scent chemicals and colognes trapped by the STU-100 pads was measured and indicated that the STU-100 has a significant trapping efficiency at ambient temperature.

SF films were prepared from aqueous solutions of the fibroin protein polymer and crystallinity was induced and controlled by methanol treatment. Dextrans of different molecular weights, as well as proteins, were physically entrapped into the drug delivery device during processing into films. Drug release kinetics were evaluated as a function of dextran molecular weight, and film crystallinity. Treatment with methanol resulted in an increase in {beta}-sheet structure, an increase in crystallinity and an increase in film surface hydrophobicity determined by FTIR, X-ray and contact angle techniques, respectively. The increase in crystallinity resulted in the sustained release of dextrans of molecular weights ranging from 4 to 40 kDa, whereas for less crystalline films sustained release was confined to the 40 kDa dextran. Protein release from the films was studied with horseradish peroxidase (HRP) and lysozyme (Lys) as model compounds. Enzyme release from the less crystalline films resulted in a biphasic release pattern, characterized by an initial release within the first 36 h, followed by a lag phase and continuous release between days 3 and 11. No initial burst was observed for films with higher crystallinity and subsequent release patterns followed linear kinetics for HRP, or no substantial release for Lys. In conclusion, SF is an interesting polymer for drug delivery of polysaccharides and bioactive proteins due to the controllable level of crystallinity and the ability to process the biomaterial in biocompatible fashion under ambient conditions to avoid damage to labile compounds to be delivered.","","","Brookhaven National Lab.

The methanol behavior was examined as a function of the Ce oxidation state, methanol exposure, and Rh particle size and coverage. When Rh nanoparticles were deposited on the ceria films, methanol decomposed on Rh to CO and H below 200 K. H atoms recombined and desorbed between 200 and 300 K. CO evolved from Rh deposited on fully oxidized ceria between 400 and 500 K. However, on reduced ceria films, the CO on Rh further decomposed to atomic C. Methanol adsorbed on the ceria films deprotonated to form methoxy as the only intermediate on the surface. This methoxy decomposed and desorbed as CO and H2 at higher temperatures regardless of the ceria oxidation state. Compared with the methanol reaction on Rh-free ceria thin films, formaldehyde formation from methoxy was completely suppressed after Rh deposition. Our results indicate that Rh can promote the decomposition of methoxy adsorbed on the ceria and that decomposition of methoxy intermediates occurred at the metal/oxide interfaces. On the other hand, the reduced ceria can promote total methanol decomposition on Rh.","","","Brookhaven National Lab. (BNL), Upton, NY (United States).

The activation enthalpy and entropy in methanol are 10.0 kcal mol{sup -1} and -18 cal mol{sup -1} K{sup -1}, respectively. The reaction enthalpy and entropy are -10.3 kcal mol{sup -1} and -19 cal mol{sup -1} K{sup -1}, respectively. Similar values were obtained in acetone. Surprisingly, the volumes of activation for dihydride formation (-15 and -16 cm{sup 3} mol{sup -1} in methanol and acetone, respectively) are very close to the overall reaction volumes (-15 cm3 mol-1 in both solvents). Thus, the volumes of activation for the reverse reaction, elimination of dihydrogen from the dihydrido complex, are approximately zero. B3LYP hybrid DFT calculations of the transition-state complex in methanol and similar MP2 calculations in the gas phase suggest that the dihydrogen has a short H-H bond (0.823 and 0.810 Angstroms, respectively) and forms only a weak Rh-H bond (1.866 and 1.915 Angstroms, respectively). Equal partial molar volumes of the dihydrogenrhodium(I) transition state and dihydridorhodium(III) can account for the experimental volume profile found for the overall process.","","","Brookhaven National Lab.

The activity of Pd monolayers supported on Ru(0001), Rh(111), Ir(111), Pt(111), and Au(111) increased in the following order: Pd/Ru(0001) &lt; Pd/Ir(111) &lt; Pd/Rh(111) &lt; Pd/Au(111) &lt; Pd/Pt(111). Their activity was correlated with their d-band centers, which were calculated using density functional theory (DFT). We found a volcano-type dependence of activity on the energy of the d-band center of Pd monolayers, with Pd/Pt(111) at the top of the curve. The activity of the non-Pt Pd{sub 2}Co/C alloy electrocatalyst nanoparticles that we synthesized was comparable to that of commercial Pt-containing catalysts. The kinetics of the ORR on this electrocatalyst predominantly involves a four-electron step reduction with the first electron transfer being the rate-determining step. The downshift of the d-band center of the Pd 'skin', which constitutes the alloy surface due to the strong surface segregation of Pd at elevated temperatures, determined its high ORR activity. Additionally, it showed very high methanol tolerance, retaining very high catalytic activity for the ORR at high concentrations of methanol. Provided its stability is satisfactory, this catalyst might possibly replace Pt in fuel-cell cathodes, especially those of direct methanol oxidation fuel cells (DMFCs).","","","Brookhaven National Lab.

The control of the pore diameter of mesoporous MCM-41 at the sub-nanometer scale may be accomplished by adjusting the pH and TMA fraction. pH may be used to control the surface free silanol group density and nickel reduction degree as well, and this is useful in the design of a specific catalyst for particular reactions, such as CO methanation, which requires highly dispersed, stable metallic clusters with controllable size.","","","Brookhaven National Lab.

The adsorption isotherms of the same four chemicals were measured by FA and the results confirmed by the independent calculation of the adsorption energy distribution (AED), using the expectation-maximization (EM) method. The effect of the length of the bonded alkyl chain was investigated. Shorter alkyl-bonded-chains (C{sub 18} versus C{sub 30}) and the end-capping of the silica surface contribute to decrease the surface heterogeneity under the same experimental conditions (30% methanol, 25 mM NaCl). The AEDs of phenol and caffeine are bimodal with the C{sub 18}-bonded columns while they are trimodal and quadrimodal, respectively, with a non-endcapped C{sub 30}-bonded column. The 'supersites' (adsorption energy &gt;20 kJ/mol) found on the C{sub 30}-Prontosil column and attributed to a cation exchange mechanism completely disappear on the C{sub 18}-Gemini and C{sub 18}-Sunfire, probably because the end-capping of the silica surface eliminates most if not all the ionic interactions.","","","Oak Ridge National Lab.

These data are acquired by frontal analysis (FA), modeled, and used for the calculation of the adsorption energy distribution (AED). Four compounds were used, two neutral compounds of different molecular sizes (caffeine and phenol) and two ionizable compounds of opposite charges, 2-naphthalene sulfonate, an anion, and propranololium, a cation. This work was done on a C{sub 30}-bonded silica stationary phase (Prontosil-C{sub 30}), using the same aqueous mobile phase (30% methanol, v/v) for all compounds, except that sodium chloride (25 mM) was added to elute the ionizable compounds. All four adsorption isotherms have Langmuirian behavior. The AEDs are tri-modal for phenol, quadri-modal for caffeine. The total saturation capacity of the stationary phase is four-fold lower for caffeine than for phenol, due in part to its larger molecular size. The equilibrium constants on the low-energy sites of types 1 and 2 are eight-fold larger. These two types of sites characterize the heterogeneity of the bonded layer itself. The density of the high-energy sites of types 3 and 4 is higher for caffeine, suggesting that caffeine molecules can be accommodated in some hydrophobic cages into which smaller molecules like phenol cannot. These high-energy types of sites characterize the heterogeneity of the whole stationary phase (silica support included). The ionizable compounds have larger molecules than the neutral ones and, accordingly, a lower relative density of sites of type 2 to sites of type 1. A tri-modal and a quadri-modal energy distributions were observed for the 2-naphthalene sulfonate anion and the propranololium cation, respectively. The fourth types of sites measured and its unusually high equilibrium constant are most probably due to ion-exchange interactions between the non-endcapped ionized silanols and the propranololium ion. No such strong interactions are observed with the anionic compound.","","","Oak Ridge National Lab.

The liquid density as a function of pressure agreed quite well with experiment, and a combination of radial and angular distribution functions were used to analyze molecular structure. From these distribution functions, it was observed that hydrogen bond strength increased with increasing pressure. This observation coincided with an increase in the molecular dipole as a function of pressure, which would definitely have a significant effect on the observed increased hydrogen bond strength. Also, methanol molecules were shown to more strongly favor exactly two hydrogen bonds at higher pressures, while fewer methanols with either zero, one, or three hydrogen bonds were observed at higher pressures. Furthermore, a majority of the compression with increased pressure was found to occur in regions perpendicular to the methanol oxygen-hydrogen bond vector. The methanol translational diffusion decreased significantly with increased pressure, while the rotational diffusion decreased at a similar magnitude around the oxygen-hydrogen and oxygen-carbon bond vectors, despite having very different overall diffusion. Finally, the hydrogen bond lifetime increased significantly with pressure, owing to the increased hydrogen bond strength.","","","Pacific Northwest National Lab.

Fluxes of olefins, methanol, acetone, toluene and C2-benzenes were measured and compared with the local gridded emission inventory. VOC fluxes exhibited a clear diurnal pattern with a strong relationship to vehicular traffic. Recent photochemical modeling results suggest that VOC emissions are significantly underestimated in Mexico City1, but the measured VOC fluxes described here indicate that the official emission inventory2 is essentially correct.

"Influence of microwave irradiation on the mass-transfer kinetics of propylbenzene in reversed-phase liquid chromatography","Galinada, Wilmer; Kaczmarski, Krzysztof; Guiochon, Georges A","10 SYNTHETIC FUELS; 36 MATERIALS SCIENCE; AQUEOUS SOLUTIONS; CHROMATOGRAPHY; DIELECTRIC MATERIALS; DIFFUSION; EXCITATION; IRRADIATION; KINETICS; MASS TRANSFER; METHANOL; MICROWAVE OVENS; SOLUTES","The effect of microwave irradiation on the kinetics of mass transfer in reversed-phase liquid chromatography (RPLC) was studied by measuring its influence on the band profile of propylbenzene in a C{sub 18}-silica column eluted with an aqueous solution of methanol and placed inside a microwave oven. The elution peaks were measured by the pulse-response method, under linear conditions. The amount of microwave energy induced into the column was varied based on the microwave input power. The experimental data were analyzed using the conventional method of moment analysis and the lumped pore diffusion model. With input powers of 15 and 30 W, the effluent temperatures were 25 {+-} 1 and 30 {+-} 1 C, respectively. The effect of microwave irradiation on the mass transfer of the studied solute was determined by comparing the band profiles obtained under the same experimental conditions, at the same temperature, with and without irradiation. The values of the intraparticle diffusion coefficient, D{sub e}, measured with microwave irradiation were ca. 20% higher than those obtained without irradiation. Derived from the method of moments, the values of D{sub e} at 15 W (25 {+-} 1 C) and 0 W (25 {+-} 1 C) were 8.408 x 10{sup -6} cm{sup 2} s{sup -1} and 6.947 x 10{sup -6} cm{sup 2} s{sup -1}, respectively, while these values at 30 W (30 {+-} 1 C) and 0 W (30 {+-} 1 C) were 9.389 x 10{sup -6} cm{sup 2} s{sup -1} and 7.848 x 10{sup -6} cm{sup 2} s{sup -1}, respectively. The values of the surface diffusivity, D{sub S}, also increased with increasing power of the microwave irradiation. It is assumed that the increase in intraparticle diffusion for propylbenzene was caused by the molecular excitation of the organic modifier that has a higher dielectric loss than the solute. The values of D{sub e} were also analyzed and determined using the POR model. There was an excellent agreement between the results of the two independent methods. These preliminary results suggest that microwave irradiation may have a considerable influence on the mass transfer kinetics in RPLC.","","","Oak Ridge National Lab.

The adsorption isotherms were measured by frontal analysis (FA), using as the mobile phase mixtures of methanol or acetonitrile and water of various compositions. The isotherm data were modeled and the adsorption energy distributions calculated. The surface heterogeneity increases faster with decreasing methanol concentration on the non-endcapped than on the endcapped adsorbent. For instance, for methanol concentrations exceeding 30% (v/v), the adsorption of caffeine is accounted for by assuming three and two different types of adsorption sites on Resolve-C{sub 18} and Symmetry-C{sub 18}, respectively. This is explained by the effect of the mobile phase composition on the structure of the C{sub 18}-bonded layer. The bare surface of bonded silica appears more accessible to solute molecules at high water contents in the mobile phase. On the other hand, replacing methanol by a stronger organic modifier like acetonitrile dampens the differences between non-endcapped and endcapped stationary phase and decreases the degree of surface heterogeneity of the adsorbent. For instance, at acetonitrile concentrations exceeding 20%, the surface appears nearly homogeneous for the adsorption of caffeine.","","","Oak Ridge National Lab.

"Reduced methanol kinetic mechanisms for combustion applications","Yalamanchili, S; Sirignano, W A; Seiser, R; Seshadri, K","10 SYNTHETIC FUELS; COMBUSTION KINETICS; METHANOL; IGNITION; FINITE DIFFERENCE METHOD; TIME DEPENDENCE","Reduced chemical kinetic mechanisms for methanol combustion were investigated by evaluating ignition delay magnitudes and combustion in a continuously stirred reactor. Unsteady computations were made to study the characteristics of the kinetic mechanisms proposed in the literature and to compare the dependence of various parameters on methanol combustion. All computations were done under isobaric conditions, and, to capture the influence of all the reactions involved in the mechanism, a very small time step was used. Finite-difference methods were used to solve the coupled differential equations. The five-step mechanism developed by C.M. Mueller and N. Peters [in: N. Peters, B. Rogg (Eds.), Reduced Kinetic Mechanisms for Applications in Combustion Systems, Springer-Verlag, New York, 1993, pp. 143-155] for premixed flames and both the five-step mechanism and the four-step mechanisms developed by C.M. Mueller, K. Seshadri, J.Y. Chen [ibid, pp. 284-307] for non-premixed flames were considered. It was found that the Mueller et al. five-step mechanism, with some modifications, best supported the spontaneous ignition and continuous stirred reactor combustion. The results were validated by comparing calculated ignition delays with available experimental data of C.T. Bowman [Combust. Flame 25 (1975) 343-354], and calculated final steady-state concentrations with chemical equilibrium calculations [J.-Y. Chen, Combust. Sci. Technol. 78 (1991) 127]. Initial temperature and concentration and the operating pressure of the system have a major effect on the delay of methanol ignition. The residence time of the continuous stirred reactor affects ignition delay and also changes the transient characteristic of chemical composition of the fuel-vapor mixture. The computations are intended to guide and explain many combustion studies that require a methanol kinetic mechanism.","","Available from doi: http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.combustflame.2005.01.018","","","","United States","2005-08-01T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: Combustion and Flame; Journal Volume: 142; Journal Issue: 3; Other Information: Elsevier Ltd.

At all the mobile phase compositions considered, the effluent temperature increased with increasing microwave energy. At 70% methanol, the mobile phase flow rate was set at 1.2, 2.0, and 2.8 mL/min. At 1.2 mL/min, the effluent temperatures at the lowest (15 W) and highest (200 W) microwave energy inputs were 25 {+-} 1 C and 41 {+-} 1 C for pure methanol, 25 {+-} 1 C and 48 {+-} 1 C for 70% methanol, 25 {+-} 1 C and 50 {+-} 1 C for 50% methanol, and, 25 {+-} 1 C and 52 {+-} 1 C for 10% methanol, respectively.

Chromatograms of propylbenzene and phenol were recorded under the same experimental conditions, on the same column, successively irradiated and not. The effect of microwave irradiation on the mass transfer kinetics was determined by measuring the second moment of small pulses of propylbenzene in a 70:30 (v/v) solution of methanol in water and microwave outputs of 15 and 30 W. The effect of microwave irradiation on the equilibrium thermodynamics was determined by measuring the elution time of breakthrough curves of phenol at high concentrations in a 20:80 (v/v) solution of methanol and water and microwave outputs of 15, 50, and 150 W. A qualitative comparison of the profiles of the propylbenzene peaks obtained with and without irradiation suggests that this irradiation affects significantly the peak shapes. However, a qualitative comparison of the profiles of the breakthrough curves of phenol obtained with and without irradiation suggests that this irradiation has no significant effect on their shapes. The peak sharpening observed may be due to an increase in the diffusivity, resulting from the dielectric polarization under microwave irradiation. This effect is directly related to an increase of the rate of mass transfers in the column. In contrast, the similarity of the overloaded band profiles at high concentrations suggests that the equilibrium thermodynamics is unaffected by microwave irradiation. This may be explained by the transparence of the stationary phase to microwaves at 2.45 GHz. The column temperature was measured at the column outlet under irradiation powers of 15, 30, 50, and 150 W. It increases with increasing power, the corresponding effluent temperatures being 25 {+-} 1, 30 {+-} 1, 35 {+-} 1, and 45 {+-} 1 C, respectively.","","","Oak Ridge National Lab.

The structure of the catalysts has been characterized with transmission electron micrograph (TEM) and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS). TEM images show that platinum particles size is in the range of 5-10nm. XPS analysis indicates the presence of zero-valence platinum. The Pt-CNT exhibited high catalytic activity both for methanol oxidation and oxygen reduction reaction. The higher catalytic activity has been attributed to the large surface area of carbon nanotubes and the decrease in the overpotential for methanol oxidation and oxygen reduction reaction. Cyclic voltammetric measurements at different scan rates showed that the oxygen reduction reaction at the Pt-CNT electrode is a diffusion-controlled process. Analysis of the electrode kinetics using Tafel plot suggests that Pt-CNT from scCO2 provides a strong electrocatalytic activity for oxygen reduction reaction. For the methanol oxidation reaction, a high ratio of forward anodic peak current to reverse anodic peak current was observed at room temperature, which implies good oxidation of methanol to carbon dioxide on the Pt-CNT electrode.

The destabilised interface results in a complex mixing of the two fluids in a pattern that resembles fingers. The conditions that enhance this type of flow instability can be found in coupled chromatographic separation systems, even when the solvents used in each of the separation stages have seemingly similar chemical and physical properties (other than viscosity). For example, the viscosities of acetonitrile and methanol are sufficiently different that instability at the interface between these two solvents can be established and viscous fingering results. In coupled chromatographic systems, the volume of solvent transported from one separation dimension to the second often exceeds the injection volume by two or more orders of magnitude. As a consequence, viscous fingering may occur, when otherwise following the injection of normal analytical size injection plugs viscous fingering would not occur. The findings in this study illustrate the onset of viscous fingering in emulated coupled chromatographic systems and show the importance of correct solvent selection for optimum separation performance.","","","Oak Ridge National Lab.

The adsorption isotherms are always strictly convex upward in methanol/water solutions. The calculations of the adsorption energy distribution confirm that the adsorption data for phenol are best modeled with the bi-Langmuir and the tri-Langmuir isotherm models for Kromasil-C{sub 18} and Discovery-C{sub 18}, respectively. Because its molecule is larger and excluded from the deepest sites buried in the bonded layer, the adsorption data of caffeine follow bi-Langmuir isotherm model behavior on both adsorbents. In contrast, with acetonitrile/water solutions, the adsorption data of both phenol and caffeine deviate far less from linear behavior. They were best modeled by the sum of a Langmuir and a BET isotherm models. The Langmuir term represents the adsorption of the analyte on the high-energy sites located within the C{sub 18} layers and the BET term its adsorption on the low-energy sites and its accumulation in an adsorbed multilayer system of acetonitrile on the bonded alkyl chains. The formation of a complex adsorbed phase containing up to four layers of acetonitrile (with a thickness of 3.4 {angstrom} each) was confirmed by the excess adsorption isotherm data measured for acetonitrile on Discovery-C{sub 18}. A simple interpretation of this change in the isotherm curvature at high concentrations when methanol is replaced with acetonitrile as the organic modifier is proposed, based on the structure of the interface between the C{sub 18} chains and the bulk mobile phase. This new model accounts for all the experimental observations.","","","Oak Ridge National Lab.

The dual path mechanism for methanol decomposition on well-defined low Miller index platinum single crystal planes, Pt(111), Pt(110), and Pt(100), was studied using a combination of chronoamperometry, fast scan cyclic voltammetry, and theoretical methods. The main focus was on the electrode potential range when the adsorbed intermediate, COad, is stable. At such “CO stability” potentials, the decomposition proceeds through a pure dehydrogenation reaction, and the dual path mechanism is then independent of the electrodesubstrate surface structure. However, the threshold potential where the decomposition of methanol proceeds via parallel pathways, forming other than COad products, depends on the surface structure. This is rationalized theoretically. To gain insights into the controlling surface chemistry, density functional theory calculations for the energy of dehydrogenation were used to approximate the potential-dependent methanol dehydrogenation pathways over aqueous-solvated platinum interfaces.","","","Pacific Northwest National Lab.

Five different methanol-water mixtures (20, 40, 60, 80 and 100% methanol, v/v) were used. Once corrected for the compressibility of the mobile phase, the data show that the elution volume of thiourea increases between 3 and 7% on the C{sub 18}-bonded columns when the ACP increases from 50 to 350 bar, depending on the methanol content of the eluent. No such increase is observed on the underivatized Resolve silica column. This increase is too large to be ascribed to the compressibility of the stationary phase (silica + C{sub 18} bonded chains) which accounts for less than 5% of the variation of the retention factor. It is shown that the reason for this effect is of thermodynamic origin, the difference between the partial molar volume of the solute in the stationary and the mobile phase, {Delta}V, controlling the retention volume of thiourea. While {Delta}V is nearly constant for all mobile phase compositions on Resolve silica (with {Delta}V {approx_equal} -4 mL/mol), on RPLC phases, it significantly increases with increasing methanol content, particularly above 60% methanol. It varies between - 5 mL/mol and - 17 mL/mol on Resolve-C{sub 18} and between - 9 mL/mol and - 25 mL/mol on Symmetry-C{sub 18}.

Calculations based upon the elasticity of the solids involved (column wall and packing material) and the compressibility of the liquid phase show that the increase of the column hold-up volume with increasing pressure that is observed is correlated with (in order of decreasing importance): (1) the compressibility of the mobile phase (+1 to 5%); (2) in RPLC, the compressibility of the C{sub 18}-bonded layer on the surface of the silica (+0.5 to 1%); and (3) the expansion of the column tube (&lt; 0.001%). These predictions agree well with the results of experimental measurements that were performed on columns packed with the pure Resolve silica (0% carbon), the derivatized Resolve-C{sub 18} (10% carbon) and the Symmetry-C{sub 18} (20% carbon) adsorbents, using water, methanol, or n-pentane as the mobile phase. These solvents have different compressibilities. However, 1% of the relative increase of the column hold-up volume that was observed when the pressure was raised is not accounted for by the compressibilities of either the solvent or the C{sub 18}-bonded phase. It is due to the influence of the pressure on the retention behavior of thiourea, the compound used as tracer to measure the hold-up volume.","","","Oak Ridge National Lab.

The elution volumes of thiourea samples (2 {micro} L) in these solutions were measured at different average column pressures, adjusted by placing suitable capillary restrictors on-line, after the detector. The reproducibility of the measurements was better than 0.2%. In the range of average pressures studied (10-350 bar), the maximum change in elution volume of thiourea is 1.3% (in pure water) and 4.0% (in pure methanol). This difference is due to the different compressibilities of these pure solvents. For mixtures, the plots of the elution volume of thiourea versus the pressure are convex downward, which is inconsistent with the opposite curvature predicted by the classical Tait model of liquid compressibility. This difference is explained by the variation of the amount of thiourea adsorbed with the pressure. The deconvolution of the two effects, adsorption of thiourea and solvent compressibility, allows a fair and consistent determination of the compressibilities of the methanol-water mixtures. A column packed with non-porous silica particles was also used to determine the compressibility of methanol-water and acetonitrile-water mixtures.

The methanol molecule shows preferred orientation near the interface with the methyl group pointing into the vapor phase. The methanol in the mixture is found to have larger dipole moments than that of pure liquid methanol. The strong local field induced by the surrounding water molecules is partly the reason for this difference.

The reactor was operated in conjunction with a hybrid catalyst system consisting of methanol synthesis and dehydration catalysts, and the influence of reaction parameters on syngas conversion was investigated. The activities of different dehydration catalysts were compared under DME synthesis conditions. Reaction temperature and pressure exhibited similar positive effects on DME formation. A catalytic stability test of the hybrid catalyst system was performed for 880 hours, during which CO conversion only decreased from 88% to 81%. In the microchannel reactor, the catalyst deactivation rate appeared to be much slower than in a tubular fixed-bed reactor tested for comparison. Test results also indicated that the dehydration reaction rate and the water depletion rate via a water-gas-shift reaction should be compatible in order to achieve high selectivity to DME. Using the microchannel reactor, it was possible to achieve a space time yield almost three times higher than commercially demonstrated performance results. A side-by-side comparison indicated that the heat removal capability of the microchannel reactor was at least six times greater than that of a commercial slurry reactor under similar reaction conditions.","","","Pacific Northwest National Lab., Richland, WA (US), Environmental Molecular Sciences Laboratory (US)","US Department of Energy (US)","","United States","2005-03-01T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: Industrial and Engineering Chemistry Research; Journal Volume: 44; Journal Issue: 6; Other Information: PBD: 1 Mar 2005","","Medium: X; Size: page(s) 1722-1727","","PNNL-SA-42358","AC05-76RL01830","Journal ID: ISSN 0888-5885; IECRED; 1573; BM0101010; TRN: US0502194","10.1021/ie0492707","","2009-12-17T00:00:00Z","15016310","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/15016310","","Industrial and Engineering Chemistry Research","6","44"

The elution volumes of thiourea samples (2 {micro} L) in these solutions were measured at different average column pressures, adjusted by placing suitable capillary restrictors on-line, after the detector. The reproducibility of the measurements was better than 0.2%. In the range of average pressures studied (10-350 bar), the maximum change in elution volume of thiourea is 1.3% (in pure water) and 4.0% (in pure methanol). This difference is due to the different compressibilities of these pure solvents. For mixtures, the plots of the elution volume of thiourea versus the pressure are convex downward, which is inconsistent with the opposite curvature predicted by the classical Tait model of liquid compressibility. This difference is explained by the variation of the amount of thiourea adsorbed with the pressure. The deconvolution of the two effects, adsorption of thiourea and solvent compressibility, allows a fair and consistent determination of the compressibilities of the methanol-water mixtures. A column packed with non-porous silica particles was also used to determine the compressibility of methanol-water and acetonitrile-water mixtures. A negative deviation by respect to ideal behavior was observed.","","","Oak Ridge National Lab.

Calculations based upon the elasticity of the solids involved (column wall and packing material) and the compressibility of the liquid phase show that the increase of the column hold-up volume with increasing pressure that is observed is correlated with (in order of decreasing importance): (1) the compressibility of the mobile phase (+1 to 5%); (2) in RPLC, the compressibility of the C{sub 18}-bonded layer on the surface of the silica (+0.5 to 1%); and (3) the expansion of the column tube (&lt; 0.001%). These predictions agree well with the results of experimental measurements that were performed on columns packed with the pure Resolve silica (0% carbon), the derivatized Resolve-C{sub 18} (10% carbon) and the Symmetry-C{sub 18} (20% carbon) adsorbents, using water, methanol, or n-pentane as the mobile phase. These solvents have different compressibilities. However, 1% of the relative increase of the column hold-up volume that was observed when the pressure was raised is not accounted for by the compressibilities of either the solvent or the C{sub 18}-bonded phase. It is due to the influence of the pressure on the retention behavior of thiourea, the compound used as tracer to measure the hold-up volume.","","","Oak Ridge National Lab.

To optimize the binding performance of MIPs, different types of polar modifiers are frequently used. Previous studies have shown that the hydrogen-bonding donor parameter (HBD) of the modifier has a large influence on the binding performance of MIPs in chiral separations. This possibility is addressed in a detailed thermodynamic study of a Fmoc-l-tryptophan (Fmoc-l-Trp) imprinted polymer, eluted with four different polar modifiers, i.e., THF, propan-2-ol, methanol, and acetic acid, which have different HBDs (0.00, 0.33, 0.43, and 0.61, respectively). Adsorption isotherm data for each enantiomer in each of these organic modifiers were acquired by frontal analysis over a 20000 dynamic concentration range. Nonlinear regression of the isotherm data, along with independent calculation of the affinity energy distributions, identified four different types of binding sites coexisting for the enantiomers on the MIP. The exception was acetic acid, which has the highest HBD. In this case, three types of binding sites only coexist on the MIP. The isotherm parameters obtained from these data show the following: (1) The association energies of the two enantiomers with a given type of sites have a similar magnitude; however, the density of the sites is higher for the template than for its antipode. (2) The nature of the organic modifier has a larger influence on the density of high-energy sites than on the association constant of these sites. (3) The molecular size of the organic modifier has a larger influence on the site density (especially for Fmoc-d-Trp) than does HBD. (4) Using an organic modifier with a higher HBD reduces the enantioselectivity on each site. (5) High-energy sites are more enantioselective than low-energy ones. (6) Using an organic modifier with a high HBD causes a larger reduction in the density of high-energy sites approached by the template molecules.","","","Oak Ridge National Lab.

The exact flow rates F{sub v} were measured by collecting the mobile phase in volumetric glasses ({delta}F{sub v}/F{sub v} {le} 0.2%). The extra-column volumes and the column hold-up volume were accurately measured at each flow rate by tracer injections. The detailed effect of the flow rate on the value of the amount adsorbed was investigated. The best isotherm model accounting for the adsorption data was the same BET isotherm model at all three flow rates. Only slight differences (always less than 5%) were found between the three different sets of isotherm parameters (saturation capacity, q{sub S}, equilibrium constant on the adsorbent, b{sub S} and equilibrium constant on successive layers of propyl benzoate, b{sub L}). The reproducibility of the same isotherm parameters measured by the inverse method (IM) is less satisfactory, leading to R.S.D.s of up to 10%. A flow rate increase is systematically accompanied by a slight increase of the amount adsorbed. This phenomenon is consistent with the influence of the pressure on the equilibrium constant of adsorption due to the difference between the partial molar volumes of the solute and the adsorbate. The larger average pressure along the column that is required to achieve a larger flow rate causes a larger amount of solute to be adsorbed on the column at equilibrium. This result comforts the high sensitivity and versatility of the FA method for isotherm determination under any kind of situation.","","","Oak Ridge National Lab.

"Catalytic Links Among the Water-Gas shift, Water-Assisted Formic Acid Decomposition, and Methanol Steam Reforming Reactions over Pt PromotedTthoria","Jacobs, G; Patterson, P; Graham, U; Crawford, A; Dozier, A; Davis, B","10 SYNTHETIC FUELS; CARBON MONOXIDE; FORMIC ACID; ISOTOPE EFFECTS; METHANOL; SECONDARY REACTIONS; STEADY-STATE CONDITIONS; STEAM; national synchrotron light source","Implied in the proposed water-gas shift (WGS) mechanisms for Pt/ceria and Pt/thoria catalysts is the presumption that reduced defect centers are formed on the surface. This X-ray absorption near-edge spectroscopy study provides direct results indicating that Pt facilitates reduction in the surface shell of thoria. Mechanistic arguments from in situ diffuse reflectance infrared Fourier transform spectroscopy (DRIFTS) are provided suggesting that the active sites for WGS, water-assisted formic acid decomposition, and methanol steam reforming are associated with oxygen-deficient centers. In all cases, a high H{sub 2}O/reactant (i.e., carbon monoxide, formic acid, or methanol) ratio was used. For WGS, CO reacted with type II bridging OH groups at reduced centers to generate surface formate intermediates, the decomposition of which is suggested to be the rate-limiting step by the observation of a normal kinetic isotope effect (NKIE) associated with the formate coverage as monitored by DRIFTS under steady-state conditions using CO + H{sub 2}O and CO + D{sub 2}O feeds. The same NKIE was observed in steady-state reaction tests. Formic acid dissociated on the surface of thoria to yield the same surface formate species as observed when CO adsorbs. An identical NKIE associated with formate decomposition was observed when switching from a feed containing HCOOH + H{sub 2}O and DCOOH + H{sub 2}O, establishing two important commonalities: (1) similarity in the mechanistic pathway and (2) importance of the role of type II bridging OH groups at reduced centers in the catalysis. Methanol steam reforming likely proceeded through a mechanism involving adsorption at reduced centers to generate type II methoxy species, with subsequent conversion to formate, unidentate carbonate, and finally CO{sub 2}. The higher NKIE when switching between H-labeled and D-labeled feeds suggests that conversion of methoxy species to formate may be the rate-limiting step. The methanol steam reforming reaction was selective to CO{sub 2} at low conversion, but CO selectivity increased at higher conversions, suggesting competition with the secondary reaction of reverse WGS at higher temperature. Pt/thoria was more selective at higher conversion for CO{sub 2} than a similarly loaded Pt/ceria catalyst. These results suggest that from a mechanistic standpoint, the two materials are virtually analogs of one another.","","","Brookhaven National Lab. (BNL), Upton, NY (United States).

Different preparation procedures are described in the literature. The molecular order and the inclination of the alkyl chains, however, are often deduced from indirect experimental evidence such as the wettability and the film thickness. In the present study we employed near edge X-ray absorption fine structure spectroscopy (NEXAFS) to determine directly the order of the molecules adsorbed from different solvents (water, methanol, water/methanol 1:1, cyclohexanol, and chloroform). It was found that films prepared from different solvents are displaying large differences in the established surface coverage and orientation.

This transition is manifested by nonlinear behavior in the temperature dependence of the average atomic mean-square displacement which increases at high temperature. Here, we present results of a dynamic neutron scattering analysis of the transition for a simple enzyme: xylanase in water : methanol solutions of varying methanol concentrations. In order to investigate motions on different timescales, two different instruments were used: one sensitive to {approx}100 ps timescale motions and the other to {approx}ns timescale motions. The results reveal distinctly different behavior on the two timescales examined. On the shorter timescale the dynamics are dictated by the properties of the surrounding solvent: the temperature of the dynamical transition lowers with increasing methanol concentration closely following the melting behavior of the corresponding water : methanol solution. This contrasts with the longer (ns) timescale results in which the dynamical transition appears at temperatures lower than the corresponding melting point of the cryosolvent. These results are suggested to arise from a collaborative effect between the protein surface and the solvent which lowers the effective melting temperature of the protein hydration layer. Taken together, the results suggest that the protein solvation shell may play a major role in the temperature dependence of protein solution dynamics.","","","Oak Ridge National Lab.

Furthermore, it is feasible that exposure to certain polar solvents, e.g., those found in clinical adhesives, can induce dehydration. In the present study, in vitro deformation and fracture experiments, the latter involving a resistance-curve (R-curve) approach (i.e., toughness evolution with crack extension), were conducted in order to assess changes in the constitutive and fracture behavior induced by three common solvents - acetone, ethanol and methanol. In addition, nanoindentation-based experiments to evaluate the deformation behavior at the level of individual collagen fibers and ultraviolet Raman spectroscopy to evaluate changes in bonding were performed. The results indicate a reversible effect of chemical dehydration, with increased fracture resistance, strength, and stiffness associated with lower hydrogen bonding ability of the solvent. These results are analyzed both in terms of intrinsic and extrinsic toughening phenomena to further understand the micromechanisms of fracture in dentin and the specific role of water hydration.","","","Lawrence Livermore National Lab.

Polarizable potential models were used to describe interactions among species. The results indicated that the iodide anions were found at the interface more often than sodium cations. The computed potential of mean force showed a relatively small minimum well depth (i.e., -0.60 kcal/mol) locates inside the Gibbs dividing surface.

Solutions of 5 molal NaNO3 were found to migrate downward 24-62% faster than pure water, in an unstable, fingered manner. This behavior was attributed primarily to surface tension induced, non-zero apparent contact angle between the imbibing and the resident fluids. For saline solutions of similar surface tension to that of pure water (achieved by the addition of 2% methanol), the migration rates and plume shapes were comparable to that of water, demonstrating that density was not the primary source of the observed differences in migration patterns. At depths where resident saturation increased above residual, the migration process appeared to occur via film flow with slight changes in saturation (&lt;4%), rather than in a series of abrupt jumps, as observed at shallower depths. A method for contact angle scaling was used to illustrate the effects of non-zero contact angles on capillary pressure-saturation curves.","","","Pacific Northwest National Lab.

Each design was operated over a range of feed flow rates. Thermal efficiencies up to 33% were demonstrated with the optimized processor, likely as a result of the low operating temperature, high methanol concentration ({approx}60 wt%) in the feed, and the high hydrogen production. Up to 3.55 sccm hydrogen was produced with relatively low carbon monoxide.

The extent of promotional effect on catalysis due to In-doping depends both on the speciation of hydrocarbon used as a reducing agent in addition to reaction temperature. In/g-alumina catalysts were tested with eight hydrocarbons (propane, propene, methanol, ethanol, 1-propanol, 2-propanol, acetaldehyde, isooctane) at a C1:N ratio of 12 to investigate the effect of hydrocarbon structure and chemistry on activity for plasma-enhanced catalysis. The degree of saturation, functionality, the location of the functional group, as well as the molecular size all proved to have an impact on the ability of the hydrocarbon to participate in NOx reduction chemistry. Plasma assist provided benefits at moderate temperature, but NOx reduction was dominated by thermal activity (no plasma required) at high temperature. The effect of aging on catalyst performance was also examined, and the most negative impact on thermal activity was observed at moderate temperatures. Plasma assist resulted in recovery of nearly all activity for most of the oxygenated hydrocarbons examined. At high temperature, aging had negligible impact on catalyst performance with the exception of catalytic reduction with methanol.","","","Pacific Northwest National Lab.

Supports influence turnover rates and the ability of RuO2 domains to undergo redox cycles required for oxidation turnovers. Oxidative dehydrogenation turnover rates and rates of stoichiometric reduction of RuO2 in H2 increased in parallel when RuO2 domains were dispersed on more reducible supports. These support effects, the kinetic effects of CH3OH and O2 on reaction rates, and the observed kinetic isotope effects with CH3OD and CD3OD reactants are consistent with a sequence of elementary steps involving kinetically relevant H-abstraction from adsorbed methoxide species using lattice oxygen atoms and with methoxide formation in quasi-equilibrated CH3OH dissociation on nearly stoichiometric RuO2 surfaces. Anaerobic transient experiments confirmed that CH3OH oxidation to HCHO requires lattice oxygen atoms and that selectivities are not influenced by the presence of O2. Residence time effects on selectivity indicate that secondary HCHO-CH3OH acetalization reactions lead to hemiacetal or methoxymethanol intermediates that convert to dimethoxymethane in reactions with CH3OH on support acid sites or dehydrogenate to form methylformate on RuO2 and support redox sites. These conclusions are consistent with the tendency of Al2O3 and SiO2 supports to favor dimethoxymethane formation, while SnO2, ZrO2, and TiO2 preferentially form methylformate. These support effects on secondary reactions were confirmed by measured CH3OH oxidation rates and selectivities on physical mixtures of supported RuO2 catalysts and pure supports. Ethanol also reacts on supported RuO2 domains to form predominately acetaldehyde and diethoxyethane at 300-400 K. The bifunctional nature of these reaction pathways and the remarkable ability of RuO2-based catalysts to oxidize CH3OH to HCHO at unprecedented low temperatures introduce significant opportunities for new routes to complex oxygenates, including some containing C-C bonds, using methanol or ethanol as intermediates derived from natural gas or biomass.","","OSTI as DE00837401","Lawrence Berkeley National Lab.

The {sup 14}C from the labeled DBM was then detected in engine-out particulate matter (PM), in-cylinder deposits, and CO{sub 2} emissions using accelerator mass spectrometry (AMS).

Rates and selectivities and the structure of supported clusters depend on the surface properties of the oxide supports. Raman spectroscopy showed that Keggin structures remained essentially intact on ZrO2, TiO2, and SiO2 after treatment in air at 553 K, but decomposed to MoOx and VOx oligomers on Al2O3. Accessible protons per Keggin unit (KU) were measured during CH3OH oxidation by titration with 2,6-di-tert-butyl pyridine. For similar KU surface densities (0.28 0.37 KU/nm2), the number of accessible protons was larger on SiO2 than on ZrO2 and TiO2 and much smaller on Al2O3 supports, even though residual dimethyl ether (DME) synthesis rates after titrant saturation indicated that the fractional dispersion of KU was similar on the first three supports. These effects of support on structure and on H+ accessibility reflect varying extents of interaction between polyoxometallate clusters and supports. Rates of CH3OH oxidative dehydrogenation per KU were higher on ZrO2 and TiO2 than on SiO2 at similar KU surface densities (0.28 0.37 KU/nm2) and dispersion, indicating that redox properties of Keggin clusters depend on the identity of the support used to disperse them. ZrO2 and TiO2 supports appear to enhance the reducibility of anchored polyoxometallate clusters. Rates were much lower on Al2O3, because structural degradation led to less reactive MoOx and VOx domains. CH3OH reactions involve primary oxidation to form HCHO and subsequent secondary reactions to form DMM and MF. These reactions involve HCHO CH3OH acetalization steps leading to methoxymethanol (CH3OCH2OH) or hemiacetal intermediates, which condense with CH3OH on acid sites to form DMM or dehydrogenate to form MF. COx formation rates are much lower than those of other reactions, and DME forms in parallel pathways catalyzed by acid sites. Secondary reactions leading to DMM and MF are strongly influenced by the chemical properties of support surfaces. Acidic SiO2 surfaces favored DMM formation, while amphoteric or dehydrogenating surfaces on ZrO2 and TiO2 led to MF formation, as a result of the varying role of each support in directing the reactions of HCHO and CH3OH and of the CH3OCH2OH intermediates toward DMM or MF, which was confirmed using physical catalyst pure support mixtures. These support effects reflect the bifunctional pathways of CH3OH reactions. These pathways are consistent with the effects of residence time and of the partial removal of H+ sites by titration using 2,6-di-tert-butyl pyridine.","","","Lawrence Berkeley National Lab.

The molecular dynamics (MD), coupled to electron scattering simulations of the Ca2+ and Sr2+ X-ray absorption fine structure spectroscopy (EXAFS) spectra are in good agreement with the corresponding experimental measurements. This work demonstrated that the combination of MD-EXAFS and the corresponding experiment measurement provides a power tool in the analysis of the solvation structure of the aqueous ionic solutions.

The methanol molecule carries a molecular polarizability to account for induction energies and forces. The computed dipole moment for the methanol molecule changed from 1.7 D to 2.8 D, respectively from the vapor to the liquid phases. This result indicated that, there is significant many-body interactions in this complex molecular system. The computed average molecular dipole moment in liquid methanol at room temperature is in good agreement with experimental measurements. The computed average dipole moments of methanol molecules near the interface are close to their gas phase values, while methanol molecules far from the interface have dipole moments corresponding to their bulk values. The structural and thermodynamic properties of the liquid methanol as well as the surface tension of its liquid/vapor interface are in good agreement with the experiments, demonstrated high quality of our potential model and approaches.","","","Pacific Northwest National Lab., Richland, WA (US)","US Department of Energy (US)","","United States","2003-11-08T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: Journal of Chemical Physics; Journal Volume: 119; Journal Issue: 18; Other Information: PBD: 8 Nov 2003","","Medium: X; Size: page(s) 9851-9857","","PNNL-SA-38946","AC06-76RL01830","Journal ID: ISSN 0021-9606; JCPSA6; KC0301020; TRN: US200413%%208","10.1063/1.1615957","","2009-12-17T00:00:00Z","15007023","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/15007023","","Journal of Chemical Physics","18","119"

For water, three desorption states were observed in the TPD spectra at 160 K, 190 K, and 250 K. The three desorption peaks were assigned to multilayer water, water adsorbed to 2-fold coordinated O, and water adsorbed to 5-fold coordinated Ti, respectively. The TPD spectra for methanol were more complicated. For methanol five desorption peaks were observed in the TPD spectra at 135 K, 170 K, 260 K, 410 K, and 610 K. The five desorption peaks were assigned to multilayer methanol, methanol adsorbed to 2-fold coordinated O, methanol adsorbed to 5-fold coordinated Ti, methoxy adsorbed to 5-fold coordinated Ti, and methoxy adsorbed to Ti at step edges, respectively. The XPS results indicated that the adsorbed water and methanol were predominantly bound to the surface in a molecular state, with no evidence for dissociation. Furthermore, the O 1s core-level binding energy for water and methanol were found to shift to {approx}0.75 eV lower binding energy, for coverages before multilayer desorption is observed in the TPD spectra. The O 1s core-level binding energy shift appears to be linear in this region, and corresponds to water and methanol bonding to Ti cation and O anion sites on the surface. The C 1s core-level binding energy for methanol was found to remain approximately constant in the same coverage regime.","","","Pacific Northwest National Lab., Richland, WA (US), Environmental Molecular Sciences Laboratory (US)","US Department of Energy (US)","","United States","2003-03-06T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: Journal of Physical Chemistry B: Materials, Surfaces, Interfaces, amp Biophysical; Journal Volume: 107; Other Information: PBD: 6 Mar 2003","","Medium: X; Size: page(s) 2788-2795","","PNNL-SA-38685","AC06-76RL01830","Journal ID: ISSN 1089-5647; 6500; KP1301030; TRN: US200412%%183","10.1021/jp0275544","","2009-12-17T00:00:00Z","15006817","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/15006817","","Journal of Physical Chemistry B: Materials, Surfaces, Interfaces, amp Biophysical","","107"

The goal is to determine the surface reconstitution of the nanostructured catalysts upon electrochemical activation for the electrocatalytic oxidation of methanol. The decanethiolate-capped gold nanoparticles of 2-5 nm core sizes were assembled as catalyst thin films on electrode surfaces using 1,9-nonanedithiol and 11-mercaptoundecanoic acid as molecular linkers. The XPS results have provided two important insights into the surface reconstitution of the activated nanostructure. First, the capping/linking thiolates or dithiolates are partially removed to produce the catalytic access, with the degree of removal being dependent on the nature of the molecular linker. Second, oxygenated species are detected on the activated gold nanocrystals, demonstrating the formation of surface gold oxide and its participation in the electrocatalytic oxidation of methanol. The findings are also correlated with results from studies of surface microscopic morphology and interfacial mass flux, and provide further insights into issues related to the design and preparation of highly active nanostructured gold catalysts.","","","Pacific Northwest National Laboratory (PNNL), Richland, WA (US), Environmental Molecular Sciences Laboratory (EMSL)","USDOE","","United States","2003-01-29T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: Langmuir, 19(1):125-131","","Medium: X","","PNNL-SA-37050","AC05-76RL01830","2235; KP1301030","10.1021/la0264116","","2016-04-25T00:00:00Z","15010092","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/15010092","","Langmuir, 19(1):125-131","",""

The catalytically active site was modeled as an isolated VO{sub 4} unit attached to the support. The calculated geometry and vibrational frequencies of the active site are in good agreement with experimental measurements both for model compounds and oxide-supported vanadia. Methanol adsorption is found to occur preferentially with the rupture of a V-O-M bond (M = Si, Ti, Zr) and with preferential attachment of a methoxy group to V. The vibrational frequencies of the methoxy group are in good agreement with those observed experimentally as are the calculated isobars. The formation of formaldehyde is assumed to occur via the transfer of an H atom of a methoxy group to the O atom of the V=O group. The activation energy for this process is found to be in the range of 199-214 kJ/mol and apparent activation energies for the overall oxidation of methanol to formaldehyde are predicted to lie in the range of 112-123 kJ/mol, which is significantly higher than that found experimentally. Moreover, the predicted turnover frequency (TOF) for methanol oxidation is found to be essentially independent of support composition, whereas experiments show that the TOF is 10{sup 3} greater for titania- and zirconia-supported vanadia than for silica-supported vanadia.

Methanol and water are selected as model fluid molecules because water represents a strongly polar molecule while methanol is intermediate between nonpolar and strongly polar molecules. Surface hydrophobicity is adjusted by varying the terminal group of -CH{sub 3} (hydrophobic) or -OH (hydrophilic) of SAMs. The authors observed for the first time from simulations the convex and concave interfaces of fluids transporting across the slit pores. Results show that the characteristics of the interfaces are determined by the interactions between fluid molecules and surfaces. The objective of this work is to provide a fundamental understanding of how these interactions affect transport diffusion.","","","Department of Chemical Engineering, Kansas State University, Manhattan, KS (US); Department of Chemical Engineering, University of Washington, Seattle, WA (US); Computational Biology and Materials Technology Department, Sandia National Laboratories, Albuquerque, NM (US)","USDOE Office of Energy Research (ER) (US)","","United States","2002-07-08T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: Journal of Chemical Physics; Journal Volume: 117; Journal Issue: 2; Other Information: PBD: 8 Jul 2002","","Medium: X; Size: page(s) 11","","","FG02-99ER45752","Journal ID: ISSN 0021-9606; TRN: US200307%%402","10.1063/1.1483297","","2016-05-09T00:00:00Z","809157","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/809157","","Journal of Chemical Physics","2","117"

The R-cut hematite surface, also referred to as the alpha-Fe2O3(012) surface has two stable surface structure in UHV. The (1x1) surface is obtained after oxidation with O2 at 750K, and has a bulk terminated structure possessing undercoordinated Fe3+ and O2- surface sites. The phonon and electronic spectra of this surface are consistent with those of hematite. In contrast, the (2x1) reconstructed surface, obtained by annealing the (1x1) surface at 950 K, possesses Fe2+ surface sites based on the electronic spectrum, but is essential hematite in structure based on the phonon spectrum. Although the atomic arrangements of the (2x1) surface are not known, the reconstruction modifies every other row of cation and anion sites that run parallel to the surface along the[1 2 1] direction.","","","Pacific Northwest National Lab.

As a first phase of this project, a methanol steam reformer system was developed and demonstrated. The reformer system included a combustor, two vaporizers, and a steam-reforming reactor. The device was demonstrated as a thermally independent unit over the range of 14 to 80 Wt output. Assuming a 14-day mission life and an ultimate 1-kg fuel processor/fuel cell assembly, a base case was chosen to illustrate the expected system performance. Operating at 13 We, the system yielded a fuel processor efficiency of 45% (LHV of H2 out/LHV of fuel in) and an estimated net efficiency of 22% (assuming a fuel cell efficiency of 48%). The resulting energy density of 720 W-hr/kg is several times the energy density of the best lithium-ion batteries. Some immediate areas of improvement in thermal management also have been identified and an integrated fuel processor is under development. The final system will be a hybrid, containing a fuel reformer, fuel cell, and rechargeable battery. The battery will provide power for startup and added capacity for times of peak power demand.","","","Pacific Northwest National Lab.

TiO{sub 2} sols were prepared by the controlled hydrolysis of titanium tetrachloride. ARG-modified TiO{sub 2} was placed in water and purged anoxically with an inert gas. Suspensions were spiked with elevated mercury concentrations (from mercuric chloride) and equilibrated for 10 min in darkness (with continuous stirring). Suspensions were either illuminated with 253.7 nm light or kept in darkness while mixing continuously. Samples were periodically withdrawn from the reactor via syringe and filtered anoxically. Precipitate collected on the filters was tested for elemental mercury; filtrate was analyzed for mercury using cold vapor atomic absorption spectrometry. Results showed that in the absence of light, approximately 60% of initial mercury could be sorbed onto the ARG-modified TiO{sub 2} [ARG (1.67x10{sup -3} M), TiO{sub 2}(5.00x10{sup -3} M)]. ARG-modified TiO2 removed greater than 99.9% of the initial mercury (150 ppm) present in solution within 128 min of illumination through sorption and reduction processes. This removal time was reduced to 32 min when methanol was added as a hole scavenger. These sorption and reduction processes were catalytic in nature. The presence of 30 ppm iron(III) greatly inhibits both the sorption and the reduction of mercury on ARG-modified TiO{sub 2}.","","","Argonne National Lab.

The catalytic reactions were performed at temperatures of 150-400 C and atmospheric pressure. The most efficient catalyst was the Cu/Al LDH, which became active at {approx}230 C, with concomitant H{sub 2} production. The Ni/Al and Co/Al LDHs were also active in SRM, however, the activation temperature was significantly higher (315-320 C). No catalytic activity was observed for the Mg/Al LDH. Significant LDH decomposition occurred during the catalytic reactions. The reducibility of the divalent cations present in the LDH was a crucial parameter in determining the steam reforming activity of the catalysts. Pre-activation of the Cu/Al LDH by calcination in air (400 C), followed by reduction in dilute H2, did not significantly change the catalytic activity. The onset of H2 production was slightly lower for the pre-activated versus as-prepared Cu/Al LDH ({approx}218 C), also the CH{sub 3}OH conversion was 5-10% lower.","","","Argonne National Lab.

Accurate quantification of PM-associated organic compounds requires validation of the laboratory procedures for recovery over a wide volatility and polarity range. To meet these challenges, solutions of n-alkanes (nC{sub 12} to nC{sub 40}) and polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons PAHs (naphthalene to benzo[ghi]perylene) were reduced in volume from a solvent mixture (equal volumes of hexane, dichloromethane and methanol), to examine recovery after reduction in volume. When the extract solution volume reached 0.5 mL the solvent was entirely methanol, and the recovery averaged 60% for n-alkanes nC{sub 12} to nC{sub 25} and PAHs from naphthalene to chrysene. Recovery of higher MW compounds decreased with MW, because of their insolubility in methanol. When the walls of the flasks were washed with 1 mL of equal parts hexane and dichloromethane (to reconstruct the original solvent composition), the recovery of nC{sub 18} and higher MW compounds increased dramatically, up to 100% for nC{sub 22}-nC{sub 32} and then slowly decreasing with MW due to insolubility. To examine recovery during extraction of the components of the High Capacity Integrated Gas and Particle Sampler, the same standards were used to spike its denuders and filters. For XAD-4 coated denuders and filters, normalized recovery was &gt; 95% after two extractions. Recovery from spiked quartz filters matched the recovery from the coated surfaces for alkanes nC{sub 18} and larger, and for fluoranthene and larger PAHs. Lower MW compounds evaporated from the quartz filter with the spiking solvent. This careful approach allowed quantification of organics by correcting for volatility- and solubility-related sample preparation losses. This method is illustrated for an ambient sample collected with this sampler during the Texas Air Quality Study 2000.","","OSTI as DE00836366","Lawrence Berkeley National Lab.

In current distribution systems for liquid fuels used in the transportation sector, commodity methanol can occasionally become contaminated with the sulfur in diesel fuel or gasoline. This sulfur would poison the catalytic materials used in fuel reformers for fuel cells. We tested the removal of this sulfur by means of ten activated carbons (AC) that are commercially available. Tests were conducted with methanol doped with 1 vol.% grade D-2 diesel fuel containing 0.29% sulfur, which was present essentially as 33-35 wt.% benzothiophenes (BTs) and 65-67 wt.% dibenzothiophenes (DBT). In general, coconut shell-based carbons activated by high-temperature steam were more effective at sulfur removal than coal-based carbons. Equilibrium sorption data showed linear increase in sulfur capture with the increase of sulfur concentration in methanol. Both types of carbons had similar breakthrough characteristics, with the dynamic sorption capacity of each being about one-third of its equilibrium sorption capacity. Results of this study suggest that a fixed-bed sorber of granular AC can be used, such as in refueling stations, for the removal of sulfur in diesel fuel-contaminated methanol.","","","Argonne National Lab.

To determine the effects of zirconia phase, a pair of Cu/ZrO2 catalysts were prepared on tetragonal (t-) and monoclinic (m-) zirconia. The zirconia surface area and the Cu dispersion were essentially identical for these two catalysts. At 548 K, 0.65 MPa, and H 2/COx (x=1,2)=3, the catalysts prepared on m-ZrO2 was 4.5 times more active for methanol synthesis from CO2/H2 than that prepared on t-ZrO2, and 7.5 times more active when CO/H2 was used as the feed. Increasing the surface area of m-ZrO2 and the ration of Cu to ZrO2 surface areas further increased the methanol synthesis activity. In situ infrared spectroscopy and transient-response experiments indicate that the higher rate of methanol synthesis from Co2/H2 over Cu/m-ZrO2 is due solely to the higher concentration of active intermediates. By contrast, the higher rate of methanol synthesis from Co/H2 is due to both a higher concentration of surface intermediates and the more rapid dynamics of their transformation over Cu/ZrO2.","","","Lawrence Berkeley National Lab.

"Methanol toxicity and formate oxidation in NEUT2 mice.","Cook, R J; Champion, K M; Giometti, C S; Biosciences Division; Vanderbilt Univ.","10 SYNTHETIC FUELS; CATALASE; FORMATES; METHANOL; MICE; OXIDATION; OXIDOREDUCTASES; PRIMATES; RODENTS; TOXICITY","NEUT2 mice are deficient in cytosolic 10-formyltetrahydrofolate dehydrogenase (FDH; EC 1.5.1.6) which catalyzes the oxidation of excess folate-linked one-carbon units in the form of 10-formyltetrahydrofolate to CO{sub 2} and tetrahydrofolate. The absence of FDH should impair the oxidation of formate via the folate-dependent pathway and as a consequence render homozygous NEUT2 mice more susceptible to methanol toxicity. Normal (CB6-F1) and NEUT2 heterozygous and homozygous mice had essentially identical LD50 values for methanol, 6.08, 6.00, and 6.03 g/kg, respectively. Normal mice oxidized low doses of [{sup 14}C]sodium formate (ip 5 mg/kg) to {sup 14}CO{sub 2} at approximately twice the rate of homozygous NEUT2 mice, indicating the presence of another formate-oxidizing system in addition to FDH. Treatment of mice with the catalase inhibitor, 3-aminotriazole (1 g/kg ip) had no effect on the rate of formate oxidation, indicating that at low concentrations formate was not oxidized peroxidatively by catalase. High doses of [{sup 14}C]sodium formate (ip 100 mg/kg) were oxidized to {sup 14}CO{sub 2} at identical rates in normal and NEUT2 homozygous mice. Pretreatment with 3-aminotriazole (1 g/kg ip) in this instance resulted in a 40 and 50% decrease in formate oxidation to CO2 in both normal and homozygous NEUT2 mice, respectively. These results indicate that mice are able to oxidize formate to CO{sub 2} by at least three different routes: (1) folate-dependent via FDH at low levels of formate; (2) peroxidation by catalase at high levels of formate; and (3) by an unknown route(s) which appears to function at both low and high levels of formate. The implications of these observations are discussed in terms of the current hypotheses concerning methanol and formate toxicity in rodents and primates.","","","Argonne National Lab.

While similar species were observed for both phases, the dynamics of the elementary processes were different. The dissociative adsorption of methanol to form methoxide species was approximately twice as fast on m-ZrO2 as on t-ZrO2. CO2 insertion to form monomethyl carbonate, an intermediate in the synthesis of DMC, occurred more than order of magnitude more rapidly over m-ZrO2. By contrast, the transfer of a methyl group from adsorbed methanol to monomethyl carbonate and the resulting formation of DMC proceeded roughly twice as fast over m-ZrO2. The observed patterns are attributed to the higher Bronsted basicity of hydrolyl groups and cus-Zr4+o2- Lewis acid/base pairs present on the surface of zirconia.","","","Lawrence Berkeley National Lab.

At higher temperatures the dielectric response along the threefold crystal axis is of the quasi-one-dimensional Ising type. At lower temperatures the higher concentrated samples order antiferroelectrically whereas the lower concentrated ones freeze into dipole glasses. The behavior is interpreted in terms of the methanol dipole moments coupled by the electric dipole-dipole interaction which is highly frustrated because of the rhombohedral symmetry of the lattice.

Measurements using the rapid-scan method revealed that the final products, HCO2 Fe and H2O, emerge with a rise time of 4 seconds (250 K) by decomposition of the 2-electron transfer intermediate, HO2CH2OH. Intermediacy of hydroxymethylhydroperoxide was established by direct detection by step-scan FT-IR spectroscopy on the 500 microsecond time scale, and by monitoring of its photodissociation products HCO2H + H2O on the millisecond and second time scale. Formaldehyde was observed as minor 2-electron oxidation product. The fast rise of the HO2CH2OH intermediate strongly suggests that it is formed by direct coupling of HOO and CH2OH radicals. This constitutes the most conclusive evidence yet for the formation of hydroperoxy radical and hydroxymethyl radical as the primary one-electron transfer products of the reaction of CH3OH and O2 at LMCT-excited framework Fe centers.","","","Lawrence Berkeley National Lab.

The dissociative adsorption of methanol occurs more slowly than the adsorption of carbon dioxide, but the species formed from methanol are bound more strongly. Upon adsorption, the oxygen atom of methanol binds to coordinately unsaturated Zr4+ cations present at the catalyst surface. Rapid dissociation of the adsorbed methanol leads to the formation of a methoxide group (Zr-OCH3) and the release of a proton, which reacts with a surface hydroxyl group to produce water. Carbon dioxide inserts in the Zr-O bond of the methoxide to form a mondentate methyl carbonate group (Zr-OC(O)OCH3). This process is facilitated by the interactions of C and O atoms in CO2 with Lewis acid-base pairs of sites (Zr4+O2-) on the surface of the catalyst. Methyl carbonate species can also be produced via the reaction of methanol with carbon dioxide adsorbed in the form of bicarbonate species with methanol, a process that results in the transfer of a methyl group to the carbonate and restores a hydroxyl group to the zirconia surface. The decomposition of DMC on monoclinic zirconia has also been investigated and has been observed to occur via the reverse of the processes described for the synthesis of DMC.","","","Lawrence Berkeley National Lab.

The adsorption isotherms are obtained for a pore of width 2 nm at a temperature of 298 K from grand canonical ensemble Monte Carlo simulations. The water molecules are modeled using the four point transferable intermolecular potential functions (TIP4P) and methanol by the optimized potentials for liquid simulations (OPLS). Carboxyl (COOH) groups are used as active sites on a structured carbon surface. The effect of the relative contributions from dispersion and hydrogen bonding interactions of adsorbates, and of the chemical activation of adsorbents on adsorption behavior is investigated. The adsorption of the mixture components in activated carbon pores occurs by continuous filling, without the sharp capillary condensation observed in graphite pores. Water is preferentially adsorbed over methanol in activated carbon pores for a wide range of pressures, except at lower pressures. The hydrophilic nature of activated carbon pores results in the complexation of both water and methanol molecules with the active sites on the surfaces, leading to bulklike water behavior over the entire pore width. Solvation forces are also calculated as a function of pore size. The negative values found for the solvation force for all pore sizes reflect the hydrophilic interactions of the mixtures with the activated carbon surfaces. {copyright} 2000 American Institute of Physics [S0021-9606(00)51339-7]","","Paper copy available at OSTI: phone, 865-576-8401, or email, reports@adonis.osti.gov","Department of Chemical Engineering, Kansas State University, Manhattan, KS (US); Department of Chemical Engineering, University of Washington, Seattle, WA (US); Department of Chemical Engineering, North Carolina State University, Raleigh, NC (US)","USDOE Office of Energy Research (ER) (US)","","United States","2000-10-22T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: Journal of Chemical Physics; Journal Volume: 113; Journal Issue: 16; Other Information: PBD: 22 Oct 2000","","Medium: X; Size: page(s) 6933-6942","","","FG02-99ER45752","Journal ID: ISSN 0021-9606; TRN: US200305%%1252","10.1063/1.1309012","","2009-12-16T00:00:00Z","807903","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/807903","","Journal of Chemical Physics","16","113"

A practical application of this work is the separation of Fischer-Tropsch waxes from reactor catalyst via supercritical extraction.

Temperature-programmed reduction and methanol oxidation were employed as chemical probe reactions to examine the reducibility and reactivity properties of these catalysts. The spectroscopic results revealed that the surface vanadium oxide species on the Al{sub 2}O{sub 3}/SiO{sub 2} supports are predominantly isolated VO{sub 4} units [O = V(O-Support){sub 3}] in the dehydrated state. The surface vanadium oxide species preferentially interact with the aluminum oxide species on the silica surface. Consequently, the reduction behavior of the surface vanadium oxide species is closer to that of V{sub 2}O{sub 5}/Al{sub 2}O{sub 3} at higher alumina loading. Furthermore, the turnover frequency of the surface VO{sub 4} species on Al{sub 2}O{sub 3}/SiO{sub 2} for methanol oxidation to redox products (formaldehyde, methyl formate, and dimethoxy methane) increases by an order of magnitude relative to the V{sub 2}O{sub 5}/SiO{sub 2} catalysts and is comparable to that of the V{sub 2}O{sub 5}/Al{sub 2}O{sub 3} catalysts. It is concluded that the substitution of the Si(IV)-O{sup {minus}} by the less electronegative Al(III)-O{sup {minus}} ligands for the isolated VO{sub 4} units is responsible for the enhanced reactivity of the surface V cations.","","","Lehigh Univ., Bethlehem, PA (US)","National Science Foundation (NSF); USDOE","","United States","2000-05-15T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: Journal of Catalysis; Journal Volume: 192; Journal Issue: 1; Other Information: PBD: 15 May 2000","","Medium: X; Size: page(s) 18-28","","","FG02-93ER14350","Journal ID: ISSN 0021-9517; JCTLA5; TRN: IM200031%%220","10.1006/jcat.2000.2822","","2010-06-03T00:00:00Z","20076091","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/20076091","","Journal of Catalysis","1","192"

CH{sub 3}CH{sub 2}CH{sub 3} and CH{sub 3}CD{sub 2}CH{sub 3} reactants led to normal KIEs for dehydrogenation (2.7) and combustion (1.8) of propane, but to a very small KIE (1.1) for propene combustion. These results show that the methylene C-H bond is activated in the rate-determining steps for propane dehydrogenation and combustion reactions. The rate-determining step in secondary propene combustion involves the allylic C-H bond. In each reaction, the weakest C-H bond in the reactant is cleaved in the initial C-H bond activation step. The measured propane oxidative dehydrogenation KIEs are in agreement with theoretical estimates using a sequence of elementary steps, reaction rate expression, and transition state theory. The much smaller KIE for propane oxidative dehydrogenation (2.8) than the maximum KIE (6) expected for propane thermal dehydrogenation indicates the participation of lattice oxygen. The different KIE values for propane primary dehydrogenation and combustion suggest that these two reactions involve different lattice oxygen sites.","","","Lawrence Berkeley National Lab., CA (US); Univ. of California, Berkeley, CA (US)","USDOE","","United States","2000-05-15T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: Journal of Catalysis; Journal Volume: 192; Journal Issue: 1; Other Information: PBD: 15 May 2000","","Medium: X; Size: page(s) 197-203","","","AC03-76SF00098","Journal ID: ISSN 0021-9517; JCTLA5; TRN: IM200031%%232","10.1006/jcat.2000.2832","","2010-06-03T00:00:00Z","20076103","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/20076103","","Journal of Catalysis","1","192"

At low temperature (230 C), the addition of low copper content prevents the loss of the active surface by sintering without inhibiting the rate of CO hydrogenation too much. At high temperatures (450 C), high copper content is necessary to limit the accumulation of poisonous carbon products, but at the expense of CO conversion. On the basis of the various kinetic and morphologic effects of copper addition, an advanced description of the CO hydrogenation mechanism is also provided, assuming an active site formed by 2--3 adjacent Ni atoms, whatever the temperature or the copper content may be.","","","Inst. de Recherches sur la Catalyse, Villeurbanne (FR)","","","United States","2000-05-15T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: Journal of Catalysis; Journal Volume: 192; Journal Issue: 1; Other Information: PBD: 15 May 2000","","Medium: X; Size: page(s) 204-214","","","","Journal ID: ISSN 0021-9517; JCTLA5; TRN: IM200031%%233","10.1006/jcat.2000.2828","","2010-06-03T00:00:00Z","20076104","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/20076104","","Journal of Catalysis","1","192"

On both types of catalysts, the rate of ethane production goes through a maximum at high temperatures. For the NiCu/SiO{sub 2} catalysts, this behavior correlates with the onset of secondary hydrogenolysis of ethane, but not for the sulfur-modified Ni/MgAl{sub 2}O{sub 4} catalysts. The selectivity for ethane formation on Ni/MgAl{sub 2}O{sub 4} catalysts was higher with sulfur than without, but a decreasing function of sulfur at high coverage. The selectivity on NiCu/SiO{sub 2} catalysts was found to increase monotonically with the copper content. Comparisons with a previous propane hydrogenolysis study on nickel-copper catalysts with very different surface properties reveal surprising agreements. The NiCu/SiO{sub 2} catalysts have been shown to be strongly enriched in copper in the surface of the alloy particles after reduction. This is similar to previous results for unsupported NiCu catalysts but in contrast to the NiCu/SiO{sub 2} catalysts used by Dalmon and Martin reported to have bulk composition also in the surface after reduction. The hydrogenolysis results of the two NiCu/SiO{sub 2} catalyst studies are, nevertheless, in close agreement, but deviate strongly from the hydrogenolysis results for the unsupported NiCu particles. It is difficult to reconcile the various hydrogenolysis results with simple ensemble models.

Gas-phase CH{sub 3} radicals were produced by pyrolysis of azomethane and dosed on O/Mo(100) at a surface temperature of 320 K. In TPD, O/Mo(100) with {theta}{sub o} = 1.4 monolayer (ML) produces exclusively CH{sub 4} and CO, but O/Mo(100) with {theta}{sub o} = 0.9 and 0.4 ML produce significant amounts of C{sub 2+} alkenes in addition to CH{sub 4} and CO.

On 0.9 ML-O and 0.4 ML-O, some CH{sub 3} groups decompose to methylene groups, which react with intact CH{sub 3} groups to form surface alkyl groups. The surface species at 320 K appear to be controlled by the preadsorbed oxygen coverage, depending on whether {theta}{sub o} &lt; 1 ML or {theta}{sub o} &gt; 1 ML. CH{sub 4} is formed via hydrogenation of CH{sub 3} groups by surface hydrogen that is a product of CH{sub 3} decomposition. C{sub 2+} alkene products are formed by {beta}-hydrogen elimination of surface alkyl groups. When atomic iodine is coadsorbed on O/Mo(100), the alkene yield in TPD is significantly reduced.","","","Northwestern Univ., Evanston, IL (US)","","","United States","2000-04-13T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: Journal of Physical Chemistry B: Materials, Surfaces, Interfaces, amp Biophysical; Journal Volume: 104; Journal Issue: 14; Other Information: PBD: 13 Apr 2000","","Medium: X; Size: page(s) 3035-3043","","","","Journal ID: ISSN 1089-5647; JPCBFK; TRN: IM200023%%357","10.1021/jp9927193","","2010-06-03T00:00:00Z","20034429","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/20034429","","Journal of Physical Chemistry B: Materials, Surfaces, Interfaces, amp Biophysical","14","104"

Rearrangement of second layer ethylene molecules has been observed between 82 and 120 K. This is a competing process with molecular desorption, interpreted as a result of migration of second layer molecules toward the surface. The results are consistent with and support previous studies that suggested the formation of a surface intermediate ({eta}{sup 2}(C,C)CHCH{sub 2}) during ethylene dehydrogenation to ethylidine. Employing a derivative mode with respect to temperature {minus}d({Delta}{Phi})/dT, the authors find an early onset for ethylidine decomposition near 265 K. {Delta}{Phi}-TPR measurements in the range 560--720 K reveal three distinct CH decomposition peaks, reflecting different activation energies for the decomposition reaction sites. The dipole moment of an adsorbed CH has been determined to be {mu} = 0.43 D, suggesting a rather polarized Ru-CH complex; its structure is independent of the adsorption site. Finally, carbide polymerization to form graphite has been detected above T{sub s} = 560 K for the first time using work function change measurements. Good agreement was found between the contribution to {Delta}{Phi} by the graphite layer formed on the Ru(001) surface and ab initio calculations performed previously on this system.","","","Hebrew Univ., Jerusalem (IL)","","","United States","2000-04-13T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: Journal of Physical Chemistry B: Materials, Surfaces, Interfaces, amp Biophysical; Journal Volume: 104; Journal Issue: 14; Other Information: PBD: 13 Apr 2000","","Medium: X; Size: page(s) 3355-3363","","","","Journal ID: ISSN 1089-5647; JPCBFK; TRN: IM200023%%378","10.1021/jp000272o","","2010-06-03T00:00:00Z","20034450","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/20034450","","Journal of Physical Chemistry B: Materials, Surfaces, Interfaces, amp Biophysical","14","104"

The purpose of the work is to make a quantitative assessment of the extent to which homogeneous gas-phase reactions contribute to the overall conversion of the ethane. In making the analysis, extensive use is made of kinetic information obtained and compiled by A.M. Dean and associates for elementary homogeneous reaction steps and by L.D. Schmidt and associates for elementary surface reactions. A critical part of the analysis is concerned with accounting for the heat effects and for the reactor temperature gradient resulting therefrom. This is absolutely essential for meeting the objective of this investigation. The rise in temperature as the gases proceed through the reactor is responsible for a very substantial contribution of homogeneous gas-phase reactions in the chemical transformation occurring. one can view the process as a sequential one in which ethane is first oxidized on the platinum surface to CO, CO{sub 2} and H{sub 2}O in the front region of the monolith. The formation of these products causes a substantial temperature increase that drives the dehydrogenation of ethane to ethylene (and acetylene) in the gas phase. The heat required to sustain these endothermic reactions in the tail end of the reaction zone is supplied by exothermic gas-phase oxidation reactions that form additional H{sub 2}O and CO. Overall, the system can be viewed as one in which the catalyst initiates gas-phase chemistry through the acceleration of exothermic reactions at the front of the reactor which increase the downstream temperature to the point where gas-phase reactions occur readily.","","","Univ. of Delaware, Newark, DE (US)","","","United States","2000-04-01T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: Journal of Catalysis; Journal Volume: 119; Journal Issue: 1; Other Information: PBD: 1 Apr 2000","","Medium: X; Size: page(s) 46-54","","","","Journal ID: ISSN 0021-9517; JCTLA5; TRN: IM200022%%135","10.1006/jcat.1999.2798","","2010-06-03T00:00:00Z","20030509","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/20030509","","Journal of Catalysis","1","119"

The authors propose that the reaction pathway for the direct methane-methanol conversion is partitioned into the H atom abstraction via a four-centered transition state and the methyl migration via a three-centered transition state. It is demonstrated that both the H atom abstraction and the methyl migration occur in a concerted manner in a time scale of 100 fs. The concerted H atom abstraction and the direct H atom abstraction via a transition state with a linear C-H-O(Fe) array are compared. The direct H atom abstraction of methane is predicted to occur in a time scale of 50 fs. Isotope effects on the concerted and the direct H(D) atom abstractions are also computed and analyzed in the FeO{sup +}/methane system. Predicted values of the kinetic isotope effect (K{sub H}/k{sub D}) for the H(D) atom abstraction of methane are 9 in the concerted mechanism and 16 in the direct abstraction mechanism at 300 K. Dynamics calculations are also carried out on the benzene-phenol conversion by the FeO{sup +} complex. The general profile of the electronic process of the benzene-phenol conversion is identical to that of the methane-methanol conversion with respect to essential bonding characters. It is demonstrated that the concerted H atom abstraction and the phenyl migration require 200 and 100 fs to be completed, respectively, in the FeO{sup +}/benzene system.","","","Kyoto Univ.

Two forms of gallium, adsorbed dihydride gallium ion GaH{sub 2}+Z{sup {minus}} and adsorbed gallyl ion [Ga=O]{sup +}Z{sup {minus}}, were considered. It was found that GaH{sub 2}{sup +}Z{sup {minus}} is the likely active catalyst. On the contrary, [Ga=O]{sup +}Z{sup {minus}} cannot be a working catalyst in nonoxidative conditions, because regeneration of this form is very difficult. Activation of ethane by GaH{sub 2}{sup +}Z{sup {minus}} occurs via an alkyl mechanism and the gallium atom acts as an acceptor of the ethyl group. The carbenium activation of ethane, with gallium abstracting a hydride ion, is much (ca. 51 kcal/mol) more difficult. The catalytic cycle for the alkyl activation consists of three elementary steps: (1) rupture of the ethane C-H bond; (2) formation of dihydrogen from the Bronsted proton and hydrogen bound to Ga; and (3) formation of ethene from the ethyl group bound to Ga. The best estimates (MP2/6--311++G(2df,p)//B3LYP/6--31G*) for the activation energies of these three steps are 36.9, ca. 0, and 57.9 kcal/mol, respectively.","","","Eindhoven Univ. of Technology (NL)","","","United States","2000-03-23T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: Journal of Physical Chemistry A: Molecules, Spectroscopy, Kinetics, Environment, amp General Theory; Journal Volume: 104; Journal Issue: 11; Other Information: PBD: 23 Mar 2000","","Medium: X; Size: page(s) 2468-2475","","","","Journal ID: ISSN 1089-5639; JPCAFH; TRN: IM200021%%278","10.1021/jp993414r","","2010-06-03T00:00:00Z","20026898","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/20026898","","Journal of Physical Chemistry A: Molecules, Spectroscopy, Kinetics, Environment, amp General Theory","11","104"

The quantum chemical models reproduce reliably the X-ray crystallographic coordinates of the active site for the oxidized diiron(III) and reduced diiron(II) states to a high degree of structural precision. The results inspired a reexamination of the X-ray structure of reduced MMOH and revealed previously unassigned electron density now attributed to a key structural water molecule. The quantum chemical calculations required construction of a model containing about 100 atoms, which preserved key hydrogen bonding patterns necessary for structural integrity. Smaller models were unstable for the reduced form of the enzyme, an observation with significant mechanistic implications. The large model was then used to investigate the catalytic intermediates Hperoxo, formed upon the addition of dioxygen, and Q, the active species that reacts with methane. The structures, which differ significantly from alternatives proposed in the literature, are consistent with the experimentally available information concerning the spin states, geometries, and thermodynamics of formation of these intermediates. Other models that have been proposed, particularly in the case of Q, are ruled out in our calculations by energetic considerations, which have a simple physical interpretation.

Three different catalytic properties of the product selectivity were observed, aldehyde formation, oxidative dehydrogenation (ODH), and combustion, depending upon the vanadium loading amount and the presence or the absence of cesium. A very low loading of vanadium (V:Si = 0.02--0.1 at.%) and the addition of Cs (Cs:Si = 1 at.%) on silica were found to be important for the formation of aldehyde. Not only acetaldehyde but also acrolein were observed in the aldehyde formation from ethane. On the other hand, catalysts with medium and high vanadium loadings (V:Si = 0.5--20 at.%) gave a dehydrogenated product, ethene, when Cs was not added to the catalysts. The addition of cesium to the catalysts with medium and high vanadium loadings changed the catalytic property from ODH to combustion. The different types of vanadyl species were identified by UV-visible and IR measurements in samples with different vanadium loadings. It was estimated that isolated vanadyl species with tetrahedral coordination, which were found mainly on the catalysts with vanadium loading lower than 0.5 at.%, became the active site for the aldehyde formation through the interaction with Cs. As a plausible reaction path giving acrolein from ethane, cesium-catalyzed cross-condensation between acetaldehyde and formaldehyde, formed in the reaction, was proposed. Polymeric vanadyl species with octahedral coordination were detected in the samples with medium (0.5--5.0 at.%) and high (10 and 20 at.%) vanadium loadings, respectively. Both species show the ODH catalytic property without cesium, but they bring about a deep oxidation of ethane if cesium is added to the catalysts.","","","Osaka National Research Inst., Ikeda (JP)","","","United States","2000-03-10T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: Journal of Catalysis; Journal Volume: 190; Journal Issue: 2; Other Information: PBD: 10 Mar 2000","","Medium: X; Size: page(s) 215-227","","","","Journal ID: ISSN 0021-9517; JCTLA5; TRN: IM200019%%284","10.1006/jcat.1999.2740","","2010-06-03T00:00:00Z","20020859","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/20020859","","Journal of Catalysis","2","190"

It was found that C{sub 2} hydrocarbons and aromatic compounds such as benzene and naphthalene were catalytically obtained with a considerable evolution of hydrogen. High methane conversion (8--12%) and rates of benzene formation obtained on the Re/HZSM-5 catalyst were similar, under the experimental conditions used, to that on Mo/HZSM-5, which has been thought to be a unique catalyst for the reaction. In contrast to the molybdenum carbide (Mo{sub 2}C) as the active phase for the reaction on Mo/HZSM-5, EXAFS and TG/DTA/mass studies suggest that the metallic Re on HZSM-5 is responsible for the catalytic dehydrocondensation of methane toward C{sub 2} hydrocarbons, benzene, and naphthalene. High and stable conversion of methane and high selectivities (70--87% based on carbon) of C{sub 2} hydrocarbons and benzene have been attained in the catalytic dehydrocondensation of methane on Re/HZSM-5 with CO/CO{sub 2} added in methane feed.","","","Hokkaido Univ., Sapporo (JP)","","","United States","2000-03-10T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: Journal of Catalysis; Journal Volume: 190; Journal Issue: 2; Other Information: PBD: 10 Mar 2000","","Medium: X; Size: page(s) 276-283","","","","Journal ID: ISSN 0021-9517; JCTLA5; TRN: IM200019%%289","10.1006/jcat.1999.2748","","2010-06-03T00:00:00Z","20020864","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/20020864","","Journal of Catalysis","2","190"

These reactions occur through the formation and the thermal decomposition of hydridocarbonyl Rh clusters. Molecular aspects of stoichiometric reactions are compared with those produced under stationary conditions with flows of premixed CH{sub 4} and O{sub 2} at very short residence time. Comparisons show that collisions between hydridocarbonyl clusters and gaseous O{sub 2} produce CO{sub 2} and H{sub 2}O.

The reaction has been found to proceed on these systems through a bifunctional mechanism, in which the activation on methane takes place on the rhodium phase while carbon dioxide is activated on the support surface via formate intermediates. The addition of a metal, such as copper, inactive for methane activation, has allowed the authors to evaluate the role of the interfacial Rh-Al{sub 2}O{sub 3} sites in the reaction. The presence of copper reduces the stability of the catalysts, though it does not have any effect on the initial activity per surface exposed site.

Two different oxidation procedures were used and the oxygen uptake has been measured. Alternating pulse experiments with oxygen and methane with various pulse intervals have revealed mechanistic information about the platinum catalyzed partial oxidation. It has been shown that carbon monoxide and hydrogen can be produced directly from methane and solid oxidized platinum. In the absence of gas phase oxygen, the maximum selectivities to carbon monoxide and hydrogen were 97 and 96%, respectively, at a methane conversion of 25%. At low surface oxygen concentrations, oxygen that is incorporated in the platinum bulk diffuses back to the surface to react with surface carbon to carbon monoxide. In that case the surface lifetimes of carbon monoxide and hydrogen are much shorter than the oxygen diffusion time and no consecutive oxidation reactions occur. The results of this study show that production of synthesis gas with high yields is possible by a direct route.","","","Norwegian Univ. of Science and Technology, Trondheim (NO)","","","United States","2000-03-10T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: Journal of Catalysis; Journal Volume: 190; Journal Issue: 2; Other Information: PBD: 10 Mar 2000","","Medium: X; Size: page(s) 439-445","","","","Journal ID: ISSN 0021-9517; JCTLA5; TRN: IM200019%%294","10.1006/jcat.1999.2770","","2010-06-03T00:00:00Z","20020869","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/20020869","","Journal of Catalysis","2","190"

An aluminosilicate cluster model containing five tetrahedral (Si,Al) atoms (5T) was used to locate all of the stationary points along a reaction path for ethane cracking at the HG/6-31G(d), B3LYP/6-31G(d), and MP2(FC)/6-31G(d) levels of theory. The cracking reaction occurs via a protonated structure that is a carbonium-like ion and is a transition state on the potential energy surface. The activation barrier for cracking calculated at each level of theory was refined by including (1) vibrational energies at the experimental reaction temperature of 773 K, (2) electron correlation and/or an extended basis set at the B3LYP/6-311+G(3df,2p) or MP2(FC)/6-311+G(3df,2p) levels, and (3) the influence of the surrounding zeolite lattice from a 58T cluster model of the zeolite H-ZAM-5. The barrier is especially sensitive to the long-range electrostatic effect of the lattice, which reduces it by 14.5 kcal/mol from the value obtained with the 5T cluster. The final calculated barrier of 54.1 kcal/mol at the MP2(FC)/6-311+G(3df,2p)//MP2-(FC)/6-31G(d) level, including corrections, is significantly smaller than values obtained by previous theoretical studies and is in reasonable agreement with typical experimental values for short alkanes.

"Homogeneous conversion of methane to methanol. 2. Catalytic activation of methane by cis- and trans-platin: A density functional study of the Shilov type reaction","Mylvaganam, K; Bacskay, G B; Hush, N S","03 NATURAL GAS; 10 SYNTHETIC FUELS; PARTIAL OXIDATION PROCESSES; METHANE; METHANOL; CHEMICAL REACTION KINETICS; CHEMICAL ACTIVATION","The C-H activation of methane catalyzed by cis- and trans-platin in aqueous solution has been studied by density functional based computational methods. By analogy with the Shilov reaction, the initial step is the replacement of an ammonia ligand by methane, followed by the formation of a methyl complex and the elimination o a proton. The computations utilize the B3LYP hybrid functionals, effective core potentials, and double-{zeta} to polarized double-{zeta} basis sets and include solvation effects by a dielectric continuum method. In contrast with the Shilov reaction studied by Seigbahn and Crabtree (J.Am.Chem.Soc. 1996, 118, 4443), in the platins the replacement of an ammonia ligand by methane is found to be effectively rate determining, in that the energy barriers to C-H activation are comparable with those of the initial substitution reaction, viz. {approximately} 34 and 44 kcal/mol for cis- and trans-platin, respectively. Several reaction pathways for C-H activation and subsequent proton elimination were identified. For cis-platin the energy barriers associated with the oxidative addition and {sigma}-bond metathesis type mechanisms were found to be comparable, while for trans-platin oxidative addition is predicted to be strongly preferred over {sigma}-bond metathesis, which, interestingly, also proceeds through a Pt(IV) methyl hydrido complex as reaction intermediate. In line with accepted ideas on trans influence, the methyl and hydride ligands in the Pt(IV) complexes that arise in the oxidative addition reactions were always found to be cis to each other. On the basis of the population analyses on the Pt(IV) complexes it is suggested that the Pt-H and Pt-CH{sub 3} bonds are best described as covalent bonds and, further, that the preference of the hydride and methyl anions to be cis to each other is a consequence of such covalent bonding. In light of these findings, the energies of several methyl Pt(IV) hydrido bisulfate complexes were also recalculated, with CH{sub 3} and H places cis to each other. The revised results provide evidence for the thermodynamic feasibility of oxidative addition of methane to catalysts such as [Pt(NH{sub 3}){sub 2}(OSO{sub 3}H){sub 2}] or [Pt(NH{sub 3}){sub 2}(OSO{sub 3}H)(H{sub 2}SO{sub 4})]{sup +}.","","","Univ. of Sydney, New South Wales (AU)","","","United States","2000-03-08T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: Journal of the American Chemical Society; Journal Volume: 122; Journal Issue: 9; Other Information: PBD: 8 Mar 2000","","Medium: X; Size: page(s) 2041-2052","","","","Journal ID: ISSN 0002-7863; JACSAT; TRN: IM200017%%92","10.1021/ja993015+","","2010-06-03T00:00:00Z","20017370","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/20017370","","Journal of the American Chemical Society","9","122"

On clean Cu(100) surface, calculations show that five successive hydrogenations are involved in the hydrogenation of adsorbed CO{sub 2} to methanol, and the intermediates are formate, dioxomethylene, formaldehyde, and methoxy. The rate-limiting step is the hydrogenation of formate to formaldehyde, and the Cu-Cu site is responsible for the reaction on Cu(100). The roles of Zn on Zn/Cu(100) catalyst are to modify the rate-limiting step of the reaction: to lower the activation energies of this step and to stabilize the dioxomethylene intermediate at the Cu-Zn site. The present comparative results indicate that the Cu-Zn site is the active site, which cooperates with the Cu-Cu site to catalyze methanol synthesis on a Cu-based catalyst. Electron transfer from surface to adsorbates is the most important factor in affecting the reactivity of these surface catalysts.","","","Kyoto Univ.

Linear chains of formate molecules were imaged by the hydrogenation of CO{sub 2} by STM at low formate coverage with the distance to the nearest neighbor of the formate species estimated to be 5.0 {+-} 0.2{angstrom}, twice that of the nearest Cu--Cu neighbor. The adsorption phase of formate thus grows linearly at the initial stage by an anisotropic attractive interaction between the formate species. The ordered structure of the formate species changed in the order of p(2 x 4), c(2 x 8), (7 x 7), p(2 x 3), (5 x 5), and c(2 x 4) with increasing formate coverage, indicating that various ordered structures appeared corresponding to the small change in the formate coverage. All the formate structures, except for (7 x 7) and (5 x 5), consisted of the same chain as observed at low coverage, with the distance between the formate chains, resulting in a lowering of the adsorption energy of the formate species as reported in the literature. On the other hand, (4 x 4) and (3 x 7/2) structures were observed upon exposing the Cu(111) surface to formic acid at 2 and 15 L, respectively, showing no chain structure of the formate species. At low formate coverage, no molecular image was observed, indicating that the formate species diffuses more rapidly than the scanning of the STM tip. Thus, the adsorption structure of formate on Cu(111) was found to be different depending on the preparation method. It is suggested that the difference in the adsorption structure strongly influences the rate constant of the previously reported formate decomposition.","","","National Inst. for Resources and Environment, Tsukuba, Ibaraki (JP)","","","United States","2000-02-17T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: Journal of Physical Chemistry B: Materials, Surfaces, Interfaces, amp Biophysical; Journal Volume: 104; Journal Issue: 6; Other Information: PBD: 17 Feb 2000","","Medium: X; Size: page(s) 1235-1240","","","","Journal ID: ISSN 1089-5647; JPCBFK; TRN: IM200017%%263","10.1021/jp9920242","","2010-06-03T00:00:00Z","20017541","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/20017541","","Journal of Physical Chemistry B: Materials, Surfaces, Interfaces, amp Biophysical","6","104"

The similar kinetic rate expressions obtained on MoO{sub x} and VO{sub x} catalysts confirmed that oxidative dehydrogenation of propane occurs via similar pathways, which involve rate-determining C-H bond activation steps using lattice oxygen atoms. The activation energies for propane dehydrogenation and for propene combustion increase in the sequence VO{sub x}/ZrO{sub 2} &lt; MoO{sub x}/ZrO{sub 2} &lt; WO{sub x}/ZrO{sub 2}; the corresponding reaction rates decrease in this sequence, suggesting that turnover rates reflect C-H bond cleavage activation energies, which are in turn influenced by the reducibility of these metal oxides. Propane ODH activation energies are higher than for propene combustion. This leads to an increase in maximum alkene yields and in the ratio of rate constants for propane ODH and propene combustion as temperature increases. This difference in activation energy (48--61 kJ/mol) between propane ODH and propene combustion is larger than between bond dissociation enthalpies for the weakest C-H bond in propane and propene (40 kJ/mol) and it increases in the sequence VO{sub x}/ZrO{sub 2} &lt; MoO{sub x}/ZrO{sub 2} &lt; WO{sub x}/ZrO{sub 2}. These results suggest that relative propane ODH and propene combustion rates depend not only on C-H bond energy differences but also on the absorption enthalpies for propene and propane, which reflect the Lewis acidity of cations involved in {pi} bonding of alkenes on oxide surfaces.

The adsorption energy for these fragments was computed using a methodology based on the atomic superposition and electron delocalization molecular orbital theory. The electronic structure was analyzed by the local density of states concept. A detailed picture of the bonding between fragments and the surface is given by examining the overlap population. In the homolytic mechanism each C-H bond breakage occurs before the corresponding hydrocarbon fragment reaches the energy barrier and the O-H is formed after surmounting this barrier. A strong C-O chemical bond is established as a consequence of the last H abstraction. On the other hand, in the heterolytic mechanism the C-H breaking is accompanied by a temporarily weakening of a second C-H bond and the formation of an increasingly strong C-Mo bond. In the last H abstraction of methane decomposition the C-H bond is broken only in the final step. while on the layer of MoO{sub 3} exposing mainly O atoms, the interactions between the CH{sub 3} or the CH{sub 2} fragment and the surface O atom are negligible; on the layer of MoO{sub 3} exposing Mo atoms, the molecular orbitals of these fragments show an important hybridization due to the significant C-Mo chemical interaction.","","","Univ.

"Temperature-programmed reduction and XRD studies of the interactions in supported rhodium catalysts and their effect on partial oxidation of methane to synthesis gas","Ruckenstein, E; Wang, H Y","03 NATURAL GAS; 10 SYNTHETIC FUELS; METHANE; PARTIAL OXIDATION PROCESSES; RHODIUM OXIDES; CATALYTIC EFFECTS; CATALYST SUPPORTS; MAGNESIUM OXIDES; LANTHANUM OXIDES; YTTRIUM OXIDES; TANTALUM OXIDES; DEACTIVATION; CATALYSIS","In the present paper, comprehensive temperature-programmed reduction and X-ray diffraction studies were conducted, with particular emphasis on the effect of calcination temperature on the interactions between rhodium oxide and support. The formation of a compound between rhodium and support oxide is strongly dependent on the nature of the support and the calcination temperature. No such compounds were formed over {gamma}-Al{sub 2}O{sub 3} and SiO{sub 2} supported Rh catalysts even after a calcination at a temperature as high as 950 C. However, LaRhO{sub 3}, MgRh{sub 2}O{sub 4}, YRhO{sub 3}, and RhTaO{sub 4} could be formed over La{sub 2}O{sub 3}, MgO, Y{sub 2}O{sub 3}, and Ta{sub 2}O{sub 5} supported catalysts after their calcination at suitable temperatures. The ease of formation of these compounds decreased in the sequence MgO &gt; La{sub 2}O{sub 3} {much{underscore}gt} Y{sub 2}O{sub 3} {ge} Ta{sub 2}O{sub 5}. The lower reducibilities of these compounds compared to that of Rh{sub 2}O{sub 3} brought evidence of increased Rh-O bond strength. In other words, the formation of these compounds after calcination is an indication of strong interactions between rhodium and support. At a reaction temperature of 750 C, La{sub 2}O{sub 3} and MgO provided stable catalytic activities and selectivities during 100 h of reaction, whereas deactivation was observed over the Y{sub 2}O{sub 3} and Ta{sub 2}O{sub 5} supported catalysts. However, because compounds between the latter two supports and Rh{sub 2}O{sub 3} could be formed at higher temperatures, reactions at higher temperatures have also been carried out. It was found that the stability of the 1 wt% Rh/Ta{sub 2}O{sub 5} could be notably improved at a reaction temperature of 900 C, and that the stability of the 1 wt% Th/Y{sub 2}O{sub 3} could be improved at a reaction temperature of 850 C.","","","State Univ. of New York at Buffalo, Amherst, NY (US)","","","United States","2000-02-15T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: Journal of Catalysis; Journal Volume: 190; Journal Issue: 1; Other Information: PBD: 15 Feb 2000","","Medium: X; Size: page(s) 32-38","","","","Journal ID: ISSN 0021-9517; JCTLA5; TRN: IM200017%%174","10.1006/jcat.1999.2736","","2010-06-03T00:00:00Z","20017452","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/20017452","","Journal of Catalysis","1","190"

Detailed analysis of both the gaseous products and the amount of solid carbon deposited have revealed that co-adsorption of the two carbon-containing gases produces major modifications in the behavior of the bimetallic surfaces. It was evident that the addition of CO to a C{sub 2}H{sub 4}/H{sub 2} feed resulted in a substantial increase in the decomposition of the olefin over all the bimetallic powders with this effect being most pronounced on the iron-rich systems. The major product from this series of Fe-Ni catalysts was found to be solid carbon in the form of various filamentous structures. The possibility that adsorption of CO was responsible for inducing perturbations in the electronic properties of the bimetallic surfaces is considered to be a contributory factor to the change in the catalytic action. A reversible deactivation/reactivation phenomena was shown to exist for iron-rich bimetallic catalysts that was observed when either CO or C{sub 2}H{sub 4} was removed and subsequently re-introduced into the reactant feed. It was interesting to find that under the same conditions this behavior did not prevail with nickel-rich bimetallic catalysts, which merely exhibited the traditional irreversible deactivation.","","","Northeastern Univ., Boston, MA (US)","USDOE","","United States","2000-02-15T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: Journal of Catalysis; Journal Volume: 190; Journal Issue: 1; Other Information: PBD: 15 Feb 2000","","Medium: X; Size: page(s) 104-117","","","FG02-93ER14358","Journal ID: ISSN 0021-9517; JCTLA5; TRN: IM200017%%176","10.1006/jcat.1999.2735","","2010-06-03T00:00:00Z","20017454","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/20017454","","Journal of Catalysis","1","190"

The reaction was carried out at 873 K using gases consisting of oxygen, methane, and water vapor. The selectivity of oxygenates was found to be a strong function of water vapor, and increased as the fraction of water vapor in a feed gas increased. Inversely, the selectivity of CO and CO{sub 2} in the products decreased as the fraction of water vapor increased. This is ascribed to the formation of silicomolybdic acid (SMA:H{sub 4}SiMo{sub 12}O{sub 40}) over the silica surface during the reaction, partially evidenced by IR measurements. Accordingly, silica-supported SMA catalysts were prepared and applied to the partial oxidation of methane under the same conditions as described above to see if SMA works as the active species for the reaction. Although SMA easily decomposed into SiO{sub 2} and MoO{sub 3} at 873 K without water vapor, it worked well for the production of oxygenates when the fraction of water vapor was more than 50% in the feed gas. The yield of oxygenates increased up to 20% of methane as the fraction of water vapor was around 60%; methane conversion was about 25% and the selectivity of oxygenates was 90%. In this paper, the authors will emphasize that SMA formed on the silica surface are the active species of silica-supported MoO{sub 3} catalysts for the partial oxidation of methane in an excess amount of water vapor.","","","Shiziuoka Univ., Hamamatsu (JP)","","","United States","2000-02-15T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: Journal of Catalysis; Journal Volume: 190; Journal Issue: 1; Other Information: PBD: 15 Feb 2000","","Medium: X; Size: page(s) 118-127","","","","Journal ID: ISSN 0021-9517; JCTLA5; TRN: IM200017%%177","10.1006/jcat.1999.2732","","2010-06-03T00:00:00Z","20017455","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/20017455","","Journal of Catalysis","1","190"

First, a bond energy analysis was performed on the silica cluster with isolated 3-and 4-coordinated Si surface atoms. Calculated bond dissociation energies for Si-H, SiO-H, and Si-OH were comparable to H-CH{sub 3}, H-OH, and O-O. In the second phase, elementary reactions around the bridge structure were studied. The facile ring-opening reaction with water, which reconstitutes a pair of vicinal hydroxyls, was found both thermodynamically and kinetically favored, in good agreement with the experiment and other theoretical methods. Activation of methane by the lattice bridge oxygen was thermodynamically unfavorable with high activation energy. On the other hand, the computational results also confirmed the important role adsorbed or activated oxygen plays in an MPO reaction, and indicated the likely formation of methanol as an intermediate in formaldehyde production.","","","Univ. of California, Los Angeles, CA (US)","","","United States","2000-02-01T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: Industrial and Engineering Chemistry Research; Journal Volume: 39; Journal Issue: 2; Other Information: PBD: Feb 2000","","Medium: X; Size: page(s) 250-258","","","","Journal ID: ISSN 0888-5885; IECRED; TRN: IM200015%%298","10.1021/ie990252c","","2010-06-03T00:00:00Z","20015479","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/20015479","","Industrial and Engineering Chemistry Research","2","39"

In this work the authors have used 1,4-dicyanobutane (DCB) as a potential solvent for this separation. Liquid-liquid equilibrium results for mixtures of an alkane + an aromatic hydrocarbon + 1,4-dicyanobutane at 298.15 K are reported, where the alkane is hexane or nonane or dodecane or hexadecane and the aromatic hydrocarbon is benzene or methylbenzene or 1,2-dimethylbenzene, or 1,3-dimethylbenzene, or 1,4-dimethylbenzene or 1,3,5-trimethylbenzene or ethylbenzene. The results show that there is a small increase in the two-phase region as the chain length of the alkane is increased. The type of aromatic hydrocarbon present in the mixture has a noticeable effect on the slopes of the tie lines. There is also an increase in the area of the two phase-region with increasing substitution of methyl groups on the benzene ring. NRTL and UNIQUAC models were correlated to the data.

Four different EPR signals, denoted as signals A, B, D, and E, respectively, have been recorded on the Mo/HZSM-5 sample during its stepwise reduction by methane. Different Mo species were identified on the basis of their reducibility and the nature of the signal concerned. There are two kinds of Mo species on the Mo/HZSM-5 sample, which are located at different positions on/in the HZSM-5 zeolite. The first kind of the Mo species is polynuclear and located on the external surface. They are either in the octahedral-coordinated MoO{sub 3} crystallite form (denoted as MoO{sub 3}oct) or in the MoO{sub x} form with a square-pyramidal coordination (denoted as MoO{sub x}squ). The second kind of the Mo species is associated with the Al atom in the lattice channels of the zeolite. The Mo species associated with Al are mononuclear species, which migrate or diffuse into the channels of the HZSM-5 during calcination. The EPR signals of migrating Mo ion (signals D and E) have hyperfine structures which are caused by the interaction between the Mo species and the lattice Al atom. And the corresponding Mo species are located at two different positions close to the Bronsted Al atoms: Al(I){hor{underscore}ellipsis}MoO{sub x} and Al(II){hor{underscore}ellipsis}MoO{sub x}. The order of reducibility of these four kinds of species is as follows: MoO{sub 3}oct {approx} MoO{sub x}squ &gt; Al(I){hor{underscore}ellipsis}MoO{sub x} &gt; Al(II){hor{underscore}ellipsis}MoO{sub x}. It was found that the O{sub 2}{sup {minus}} species might exist on the surface of the Mo/HZSM-5 catalyst during the induction period of the reaction. The variation of the different Mo species in a 6%Mo/HZSM-5 sample during the reaction course is illustrated, and the relationship between the catalytic performance and the intensity of the EPR spectra is discussed. It is proposed that Mo{sub 2}C is located at the external surface, while partial reduced Mo species associated with the Al atom is inside the channel during the reaction. Both of these Mo species play a key role in methane dehydro-aromatization.","","","Chinese Academy of Sciences, Dalian (CN)","","","United States","2000-01-25T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: Journal of Catalysis; Journal Volume: 189; Journal Issue: 2; Other Information: PBD: 25 Jan 2000","","Medium: X; Size: page(s) 314-325","","","","Journal ID: ISSN 0021-9517; JCTLA5; TRN: IM200012%%459","10.1006/jcat.1999.2704","","2010-06-03T00:00:00Z","20014531","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/20014531","","Journal of Catalysis","2","189"

The reactions were carried out using a Y-type reactor with metal rods as the inner electrodes inside quartz tubes and aluminum foil wrapped around quartz tubes as the outer electrodes. The waveforms, input voltages, and currents of the reactions were monitored with an oscilloscope. Interactions between excited methane and excited carbon dioxide as well as those between one excited species and the other unexcited species were observed. The products of the reactions include carbon monoxide, hydrogen, ethane, ethylene, propane, and acetylene. The effects of many reaction parameters, including input voltage, total flow rate, mole ratio of methane to carbon dioxide, selective excitation of either reactant, and micro-arc formation, on product distribution and energy efficiency have been investigated. With an increase in the carbon dioxide-to-methane ratio the selectivity to carbon monoxide increased, and less coke formed. Micro-arc formation between excited methane and excited carbon dioxide increased the conversions of both methane and carbon dioxide and favored the production of carbon monoxide. The energy efficiency of the reaction reached a maximum at CH{sub 4}/CO{sub 2} = 1 with micro-arc formation, but it was minimized at CH{sub 4}/CO{sub 2} = 1 when no micro-arc formed during the reaction.

The structure of the ZrO{sub 2} support and of the dispersed MoO{sub x} species was characterized by X-ray diffraction and by Raman and UV-visible spectroscopies. The structure of dispersed molybdena depends on the Mo surface density and on the temperature at which catalyst precursors are treated in air. Polymolybdate domains were detected by Raman at Mo surface densities below 5 Mo/nm{sup 2}. At higher surface densities, MoO{sub 3} and ZrMo{sub 2}O{sub 8} are present; their relative concentrations depend on the pretreatment temperature. Below 773 K, MoO{sub 3} is the predominant structure at high surface densities, but ZrMo{sub 2}O{sub 8} forms above 773 K. UV-visible edge energies decrease with increasing surface density for samples containing polymolybdate species, suggesting that MoO{sub x} domains become larger as the Mo surface density increases. ODH turnover rates decrease with increasing Mo surface density on samples containing polymolybdate species and MoO{sub 3}. This trend is accompanied by an increase in the initial propene selectivity and in the vibrational frequency of Mo=O bonds. Higher Mo{double{underscore}bond}O vibrational frequencies reflect stronger Mo=O bonds, which show lower ODH reactivity; therefore, the lower ODH reaction rates (per Mo atom) at higher Mo surface densities arise from the lower reactivity of Mo=O bonds, while higher initial propene selectivities arise either from the decrease of exposed Mo-O-Zr bonds or the lower reactivity of Mo=O bonds as the size of MoO{sub x} domains increases with increasing Mo surface density. At similar Mo surface densities, samples containing predominantly ZrMo{sub 2}O{sub 8}/ZrO{sub 2} show higher turnover rates and lower initial propene selectivities than those containing MoO{sub 3} species because the vibrational frequency of the Mo=O bond for ZrMo{sub 2}O{sub 8}/ZrO{sub 2} also decreased with increasing Mo surface density, ultimately due to the increase of the particle size which leads to lower propane accessibility.","","","Lawrence Berkeley National Lab., CA (US); Univ. of California, Berkeley, CA (US)","USDOE","","United States","2000-01-25T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: Journal of Catalysis; Journal Volume: 189; Journal Issue: 2; Other Information: PBD: 25 Jan 2000","","Medium: X; Size: page(s) 421-430","","","AC03-76SF00098","Journal ID: ISSN 0021-9517; JCTLA5; TRN: IM200012%%467","10.1006/jcat.1999.2720","","2010-06-03T00:00:00Z","20014539","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/20014539","","Journal of Catalysis","2","189"

On the nonreduced catalyst, CO adsorption spectra showed the presence of bands, indicating various CO forms on Ru sites in a sulfur-rich environment. When sulfur was progressively removed from the ruthenium sulfide phase, the number of coordinatively unsaturated Ru sites increased with the simultaneous formation of metallic Ru microdomains. A comparison of measurements of adsorption and catalytic activity showed that a rich sulfur environment was needed for the condensation of CH{sub 3}SH to CH{sub 3}SCH{sub 3}, a reaction that required acidic sites, while butene hydrogenation required highly depleted Ru sites.

When adsorption is carried out at 223 K, upon temperature programming some of the butyl-hydroxyl species recombine resulting in butane desorption at 260 K. However, when adsorption is carried out at 423 K, the hydroxyl species of the butyl-hydroxyl pair migrate away from the butyl species during the adsorption, forming water which is detected in the gas phase. Butane therefore is not observed to desorb at 260 K after the authors lowered the temperature to 223 K under the butane/helium from the adsorption temperature of 423 K prior to temperature programming from that temperature to 1100 K under a helium stream. Anaerobic temperature-programmed oxidation of n-butane produces butene and butadiene at a peak maximum temperature of 1000 K; this is exactly the temperature at which, upon temperature programming, oxygen evolves from the lattice and desorbs as O{sub 2}. This, and the fact that the amount of oxygen desorbing from the (VO){sub 2}P{sub 2}O{sub 7} at {approximately}1000 K is the same as that required for the oxidation of the n-butane to butene and butadiene, strongly suggests (1) that lattice oxygen as it emerges at the surface is the selective oxidant and (2) that its appearance at the surface is the rate-determining step in the selective oxidation of n-butane. The surface of the (VO){sub 2}P{sub 2}O{sub 7} catalyst on which this selective oxidation takes place has had approximately two monolayers of oxygen removed from it by unselective oxidation of the n-butane to CO, CO{sub 2}, and H{sub 2}O between 550 and 950 K and has had approximately one monolayer of carbon deposited on it at {approximately}1000 K. It is apparent, therefore, that the original crystallography of the (VO){sub 2}P{sub 2}O{sub 7} catalyst will not exist during this selective oxidation and that theories that relate selectivity in partial oxidation to the (100) face of the (VO){sub 2}P{sub 2}O{sub 7} catalyst cannot apply in this case.","","","UMIST, Manchester (GB)","","","United States","2000-01-25T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: Journal of Catalysis; Journal Volume: 189; Journal Issue: 2; Other Information: PBD: 25 Jan 2000","","Medium: X; Size: page(s) 253-262","","","","Journal ID: ISSN 0021-9517; JCTLA5; TRN: IM200012%%457","10.1006/jcat.1999.2513","","2010-06-03T00:00:00Z","20014529","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/20014529","","Journal of Catalysis","2","189"

Fuel/engine efficiency, energy use, pollutant discharges, and greenhouse gas emissions are estimated for spark and compression ignited, direct injected (DI), and indirect injected (II) engines fueled by conventional and reformulated gasoline, reformulated diesel, compressed natural gas (CNG), and alcohols. Since comparisons of fuels and technologies in dissimilar vehicles are misleading, the authors hold emissions level, range, vehicle size class, and style constant. At present, CNG vehicles have the best exhaust emissions performance while DI diesels have the worst. Compared to a conventional gasoline fueled II automobile, greenhouse gases could be reduced by 40% by a DI CNG automobile and by 25% by a DI diesel. Gasoline- and diesel-fueled automobiles are able to attain long ranges with little weight or fuel economy penalty. CNG vehicles have the highest penalty for increasing range, due to their heavy fuel storage systems, but are the most attractive for a 160-km range. DI engines, particularly diesels, may not be able to meet strict emissions standards, at least not without lowering efficiency.","","","Carnegie Mellon Univ., Pittsburgh, PA (US)","","","United States","2000-01-15T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: Environmental Science and Technology; Journal Volume: 34; Journal Issue: 2; Other Information: PBD: 15 Jan 2000","","Medium: X; Size: page(s) 225-231","","","","Journal ID: ISSN 0013-936X; ESTHAG; TRN: US0001149","10.1021/es9905290","","2010-06-03T00:00:00Z","20014591","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/20014591","","Environmental Science and Technology","2","34"

Different combinations of the reaction rate equation were evaluated with the aid of a nonlinear regression procedure.

The materials represented in the space of the residue curve map are partitioned into lumped materials bounded by the thermodynamic boundaries and pinches. Subsequently, the operating units are identified on the basis of these lumped materials. The efficacy of the method has been amply illustrated by generating some feasible flowsheets with a set of relatively simple heuristics for the process of producing pure ethanol from its aqueous solution via azeotropic distillation, which is a typical complex process involving thermodynamic pinches, such as azeotropes, phase transition, and/or phase separation. The method is applicable to other complex processes, e.g., crystallization, extraction, reactive distillation, and their combinations. It is highly likely that the method can be an integral part of any conventional heuristic or algorithmic flowsheeting procedure because selecting plausible or candidate operating units is essential for synthesizing a flowsheet by any procedure.","","","Kansas State Univ., Manhattan, KS (US)","","","United States","2000-01-01T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: Industrial and Engineering Chemistry Research; Journal Volume: 39; Journal Issue: 1; Other Information: PBD: Jan 2000","","Medium: X; Size: page(s) 175-184","","","","Journal ID: ISSN 0888-5885; IECRED; TRN: IM200012%%443","10.1021/ie990098u","","2010-06-03T00:00:00Z","20014515","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/20014515","","Industrial and Engineering Chemistry Research","1","39"

The aim was to clarify (1) the nature of the catalyst in the working state, (2) the redox behavior of copper in various oxidation states, and (3) the formation and transformation of precursor species in methanol synthesis. The effects of reaction pressure, temperature, and space velocity on the catalytic performance were also investigated. The optimum reaction conditions were pressure = 3.0 MPa, space velocity = 3600 h{sup {minus}1}, and temperature = 240 C. After H{sub 2} reduction at 250 C, the YBa{sub 2}Cu{sub 3}O{sub 7} transformed from an orthorhombic to a tetragonal structure, a phase which is active for methanol synthesis. In a H{sub 2}-reduced YBa{sub 2}Cu{sub 3}O{sub 7} sample, there were Cu{sup +} and oxygen vacancies and electrons trapped at the oxygen vacancies. The authors observed that CO{sub 2} adsorption would consume the trapped electrons, resulting in the reoxidation of Cu{sup +} to Cu{sup 2+}. Intermediate species such as formate, methylenebisoxy, formyl, formaldehyde, and methoxide were observed in in situ-FTIR and FT-Raman studies; they were also captured by CD{sub 3}I during methanol synthesis. Based on these experimental results, a reaction mechanism for CO{sub 2} hydrogenation to methanol over YBa{sub 2}Cu{sub 3}O{sub 7} was proposed. In this mechanism, hydrogen adsorbs dissociatively at the Cu{sup +} sites of the CuO{sub x} planes, whereas CO{sub 2} adsorbs at the oxygen vacancies. The spillover of hydrogen atoms from Cu{sup +} to the oxygen atoms and/or carbon atom of adsorbed CO{sub 2} leads to the formation of COOH, COHOH, HCOHOH, and H{sub 2}COHOH species; subsequently, one of the C-O bonds is weakened. Other intermediate species such as formate, methylenebisoxy, formyl, formaldehyde, and methoxide could be formed, and the final products are methanol, bimethyl ether, and CO.","","","Hong Kong Baptist Univ., Kowloon (HK)","","","United States","2000-01-01T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: Journal of Catalysis; Journal Volume: 189; Journal Issue: 1; Other Information: PBD: 1 Jan 2000","","Medium: X; Size: page(s) 1-15","","","","Journal ID: ISSN 0021-9517; JCTLA5; TRN: IM200012%%446","10.1006/jcat.1999.2682","","2010-06-03T00:00:00Z","20014518","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/20014518","","Journal of Catalysis","1","189"

The potential energy diagram is presented for the overall reaction of surface carbon with dihydrogen to methane or, equivalently, the conversion of methane to surface carbon, including all adsorbed intermediates and transition states. All CH{sub x} intermediates prefer threefold sites. The transition states involve the formation of C-H bonds on top of a Ni atom, with the reaction coordinate being primarily a C-H stretch. The calculated activation energies to form the C-H bond are near 70--85 kJ/mol for different CH{sub x} species. To illustrate the new possibilities offered by detailed potential energy diagrams, the results from the quantum chemical calculations are combined with experimental results in the literature to make initial estimates of kinetic parameters involved in the methanation of CO over nickel. Sensitivity analyses in this region of parameter space are used to assess the effects of these kinetic parameters on the overall rate of methanation. A good description of the experimental methanation reaction kinetics is achieved by adjusting the sensitive kinetic parameters within reasonable ranges. The kinetic analyses shows that adsorbed CO and CH are the most abundant species on the surface, and the energies of the transition states to form methyl species from methylene species and to form methane from methyl species appear to control the rate of the overall reaction.","","","Univ. of Wisconsin, Madison, WI (US)","","","United States","2000-01-01T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: Journal of Catalysis; Journal Volume: 189; Journal Issue: 1; Other Information: PBD: 1 Jan 2000","","Medium: X; Size: page(s) 16-30","","","","Journal ID: ISSN 0021-9517; JCTLA5; TRN: IM200012%%447","10.1006/jcat.1999.2699","","2010-06-03T00:00:00Z","20014519","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/20014519","","Journal of Catalysis","1","189"

For oil producers, this is problematic for a number of reasons. What do you do with associated gas when environmental regulations worldwide are banning flaring due to concerns over greenhouse gas emissions? Reinjection is costly and may not be the best solution in every reservoir. While many producers have enormous gas reserves, they are of no value if that gas is just sitting in the ground with no potential markets at hand. How can you monetize these reserves? A potential solution to the problem of stranded gas reserves is GTL processing. This process takes methane and converts it to synthesis gas, uses the Fischer-Tropsch (FT) process to convert the synthesis gas to syncrude, and upgrades the syncrude to various hydrocarbon chains to produce a variety of refined products. Three recent developments favor commercial GTL development: environmental regulations are creating a premium for ultraclean fuels; new technology is lowering the capital costs and operating costs of GTL development; and world oil prices have risen above $20/bbl.

One of the most significant technological developments in decades, commercial GTL creates new options for solving multiple existing problems, and much more. It enables the monetization of vast deposits of shut-in gas reserves, allowing industry to book billions of dollars of assets that would otherwise remain virtually worthless. As a result, GTL has the potential to add immensely to the world's supply of clean liquid fuels. It also opens up myriad new opportunities, not just upstream but downstream and beyond. In fact, ultraclean synthetic fuels, free of sulfur and aromatics, could be the enablers of new engine and emissions-control technologies that will transform the automotive industry as well. As powerful as the upstream incentives are, even more compelling market forces downstream may drive construction of the first plants. The convergence of these forces and events points inevitably to the commercialization and growth of this new industry.","","","Syntroleum Corp., Tulsa, OK (US)","","","United States","2000-01-01T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: Hart's E&P; Journal Volume: 73; Journal Issue: 1; Other Information: PBD: Jan 2000","","Medium: X; Size: page(s) 79-80","","","","Journal ID: ISSN 1527-8322; TRN: IM200033%%28","","","2010-06-03T00:00:00Z","20082181","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/20082181","","Hart's E&P","1","73"

The catalytic data indicate that the higher the acid character of catalysts the lower is both the selectivity to C{sub 4}-olefins from n-butane and the selectivity to butadiene from both 1-butene or trans-2-butene. Thus, OXDH reactions are mainly observed from n-butane and butenes on basic catalysts. The different catalytic performance of both types of catalysts is a consequence of the isomerization of olefins on acid sites, which appears to be a competitive reaction with the selective way, i.e., the oxydehydrogenation process by a redox mechanism. Infrared spectroscopy data of 1-butene adsorbed on supported vanadium oxide catalysts suggest the presence of different adsorbed species. O-containing species (carbonyl and alkoxide species) are observed on catalysts with acid sites while adsorbed butadiene species are observed on catalysts with basic sites. According to these results a reaction network for the oxydehydrogenation of n-butane is proposed with parallel and consecutive reactions.","","","Inst. de Techologia Quimica, Valencia (ES)","","","United States","2000-01-01T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: Journal of Catalysis; Journal Volume: 189; Journal Issue: 1; Other Information: PBD: 1 Jan 2000","","Medium: X; Size: page(s) 147-157","","","","Journal ID: ISSN 0021-9517; JCTLA5; TRN: IM200012%%452","10.1006/jcat.1999.2689","","2010-06-03T00:00:00Z","20014524","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/20014524","","Journal of Catalysis","1","189"

The inert liquid medium used in this investigation is a white mineral oil, Witco-40. This multiphase reaction is conducted in a mechanically agitated slurry reactor. In this process, syngas conversion can be significantly improved by coproduction of dimethyl ether along with methanol. The coproduction strategy improves the thermodynamic and kinetic environment of the reaction system. The effects of catalyst loadings in the slurry and the roles played by carbon dioxide in dimethyl ether synthesis were studied by conducting kinetic experiments. The liquid-phase dimethyl ether synthesis process exhibits higher carbon dioxide tolerance as compared to the liquid-phase methanol synthesis process, whose optimal carbon dioxide concentration in the unbalanced syngas feed is around 8%. These results have been experimentally confirmed.","","","Univ. of Missouri, Columbia, MO (US)","","","United States","2000-01-01T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: Energy Sources; Journal Volume: 22; Journal Issue: 1; Other Information: PBD: Jan 2000","","Medium: X; Size: page(s) 77-82","","","","Journal ID: ISSN 0090-8312; EGYSAO; TRN: IM200011%%341","10.1080/00908310050014234","","2010-06-03T00:00:00Z","20014036","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/20014036","","Energy Sources","1","22"

The authors report that Pt(IV) dialkyl hydride complex reacts cleanly with dioxygen to produce a dialkyl Pt(IV) hydroperoxide species. Of potential relevance to the development of alkane oxidation systems is that the Pt(IV) dialkyl hydride reactant is analogous to compounds formed by intermolecular oxidative addition of alkane C-H bonds to Pt(II).

All catalysts are highly selective to propene under nonoxidative conditions at 823 K. In both series of catalysts, the initial activity increases with the chromium content, but generally CrZrP-Xb catalysts are more active than those of series CrZrP-Xa, which is in good agreement with their higher chromium contents and greater dispersions. In all cases, deactivation was detected due to coke formed from undesired reactions. When the reactions were carried out under oxidative conditions at 673 K, the activities were enhanced and the observed deactivation was minimum. The activities found vary between 0.47 and 1.31 {micro}mol of propene g{sup {minus}1} s{sup {minus}1} and are maintained after 200 min of reaction. These activity values were also related to the chromium content, being slightly higher for CrZrP-Xb materials. A parallel study to evaluate the influence of acidity in the obtained results has been carried out. The activities found of these catalysts seem to be related to the presence of Cr(III) centers with vacancies in their coordination sphere. These vacancies, in nonoxidative conditions, can activate the reactive molecules originating propene and hydrogen. On the other hand, in an oxidative atmosphere, Cr(III) species can activate oxygen molecules, through an electronic transference process, yielding propene and water.","","","Univ. de Malaga (ES)","","","United States","1999-11-23T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: Langmuir; Journal Volume: 15; Journal Issue: 24; Other Information: PBD: 23 Nov 1999","","Medium: X; Size: page(s) 8421-8428","","","","Journal ID: ISSN 0743-7463; LANGD5; TRN: IM200008%%8","10.1021/la990504e","","2010-06-03T00:00:00Z","20006401","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/20006401","","Langmuir","24","15"

First, we deposit a surfactant-templated silica (STS) intermediate layer on top of a commercial {gamma}-alumina support both to improve its ''surface finish'' and to prevent a subsequently deposited microporous overlayer from penetrating into the support. Second, membranes are processed under clean room conditions to avoid dust contamination and, third, membranes are vacuum-calcined to promote further pore shrinkage and impart surface hydrophobicity. The resulting asymmetric membrane exhibits a gradual change in pore diameter from 50{angstrom} ({gamma}-alumina support layer) to 10-12{angstrom} (STS intermediate layer), and then to 3-4{angstrom} (30nm thick, ultramicroporous silica top-layer). Compared to a single-layer process using only the microporous overlayer, the dual-layer process improves both flux and selectivity. For the industrially important problem of natural gas purification, the combined CO{sub 2} flux [(3{approx} 0.5) x 10{sup {minus}4} cm{sup 3}(STP)/(s{center_dot}cm{sup 2}{center_dot}cm-Hg)] and CO{sub 2}/CH{sub 4} separation factors [200{approx}600] are superior to all previously reported values for separation of a 50/50 (v/v) CO{sub 2}/CH{sub 4} gas mixture.

Catalytic performances at atmospheric pressure and 493 K were evaluated after low temperature reduction (LTR, 533--573 K) and after high temperature reduction (HTR, 773 K). Temperature-programmed reduction characterization revealed that the reduction temperature of the dominant Co phase on calcined catalysts, Co{sub 3}O{sub 4}, strongly decreased as the Rh/Co bulk atomic ratio increased, while the reduction temperature of the RH{sub 2}O{sub 3} phase (363 to 419 K) was not strongly influenced by the presence of Co{sub 3}O{sub 4}. It was observed that the activity decay effect caused by metal-support interaction was remarkably inhibited on the bimetallics with respect to the monometallics by comparing reaction rate after LTR and after HTR. The addition of Rh to the Co monometallic catalyst significantly altered the product distribution. An unusual promotion of the selectivity to long chain hydrocarbons were observed. This promotion was more intense after HTR on the bimetallic catalysts, reaching {approximately}56% in the diesel fraction on the bimetallic catalyst with higher Rh concentration. Alcohol selectivity was enhanced up to 3.5 and 5.4% for ethanol and propanol, respectively, on the bimetallic catalyst with lower Rh concentration. The total CO hydrogenation reaction rate and the selectivity for methane were approximately constant as the Rh concentration on the bimetallics increased, suggesting that the metal surface area did not vary considerably on these catalysts. This agrees with hydrogen adsorption measurements on the bimetallic catalysts and with the XPS surface structural characterization of the calcined CO-Rh/Nb{sub 2}O{sub 5} catalysts, which revealed that the specific surface area of active metal (Rh + Co) precursor oxide did not vary considerably as the Rh concentration increased.","","","Univ.

Minimum PM concentrations are emitted at a global fuel/air ratio within 10% of stoichiometric, with the exact value depending on the particular fuel. Concentrations can increase by more than 3 orders of magnitude when the fuel/air ratio is either increased or decreased 30% from stoichiometric.

"The role of subsurface oxygen in the silver-catalyzed, oxidative coupling of methane","Nagy, A J; Mestl, G; Schloegl, R","03 NATURAL GAS; 10 SYNTHETIC FUELS; METHANE; REFORMER PROCESSES; OXIDATION; SILVER; CATALYTIC EFFECTS; ACTIVATION ENERGY; CHEMICAL REACTION KINETICS","The silver-catalyzed, oxidative coupling of methane to C{sub 2} hydrocarbons (OCM) is shown to be an extremely structure-sensitive reaction. Reaction-induced changes in the silver morphology lead to changes in the nature and extent of formation of various bulk and surface-terminating crystal structures. This, in turn, impacts the adsorption properties and diffusivity of oxygen in silver which is necessary to the formation of subsurface oxygen. A strongly bound, Lewis basic, oxygen species which is intercalated in the silver crystal structure is formed as a which a intercalated in the silver crystal structure is formed as a result of these diffusion processes. This species is referred to as O{sub {gamma}} and acts as a catalytically active crystal structure is formed as a result of these diffusion process. This species is referred to as O{gamma} and acts a catalytically active site for the direct dehydrogenation of a variety of organic reactants. It is found that the activation energy for methane coupling over silver of 138 kJ/mol is nearly energy for methane coupling over silver of 138 kJ/mol is nearly identical to the value of 140 kJ/mol for oxygen diffusion in silver measured under similar conditions. This correlation between the diffusion kinetics of bulk-dissolved oxygen and the reaction kinetics of the oxidative coupling of methane to C{sub 2} hydrocarbons suggests that the reaction is limited by the formation of P{gamma} via surface segregation of bulk dissolved oxygen. Catalysis over fresh silver catalysts indicates an initially preferential oxidation of CH{sub 4} to complete oxidation projects. This is result of the reaction of methane with surface bound atomic oxygen which forms preferentially on high-index terminating crystalline planes. Reaction-induced facetting of the silver results in a restructuring of the catalysts from one which initially catalyzes the complete oxidation of methane to CO{sub x} and water to a catalyst which preferentially catalyzes the formation of coupling products. This represents an extremely dynamic situation in which a solid-state restructuring of the catalyst results in the formation of a Lewis-basic, silver-oxygen species which preferentially catalyzes the dehydrogenation of organic molecules.","","","Dept. of Inorganic Chemistry, Berlin (DE)","","","United States","1999-11-15T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: Journal of Catalysis; Journal Volume: 188; Journal Issue: 1; Other Information: PBD: 15 Nov 1999","","Medium: X; Size: page(s) 58-68","","","","Journal ID: ISSN 0021-9517; JCTLA5; TRN: IM200004%%73","10.1006/jcat.1999.2651","","2010-06-03T00:00:00Z","20003851","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/20003851","","Journal of Catalysis","1","188"

The specific rate of methane synthesis, which is a direct measure of the catalyst activity toward the Fischer-Tropsch synthesis, measured at 460 Torr and temperatures from 400 to 500 K, varied from 0.01 x 10{sup {minus}3} to 3 x 10{sup {minus}3}S{sup {minus}1}. As little as 3% Ag reduced the methanation rate of Ru by 80%. The temperature dependence of the turnover frequency showed that the apparent activation energy for methanation dropped from 24 kcal/mol for the monometallic ruthenium case to 18 kcal/mol for the bimetallic case. Since silver does not adsorb or react with either hydrogen or carbon monoxide, these results show that silver does not act merely as a dilutant in the bimetallic system. These observations are elucidated in terms of a new model for surface-sensitive hydrogen adsorption, termed portal site mediated adsorption, where low-coordination edge and corner sites on the catalyst surface act as sinks for rapid, dissociative adsorption of weakly bound, highly mobile surface hydrogen. In situ {sup 1}H-NMR measurements of surface hydrogen coverages during reaction were used to confirm the kinetic model treatment of the reaction data.","","","Iowa State Univ., Ames, IA (US)","USDOE; National Science Foundation (NSF)","","United States","1999-11-15T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: Journal of Catalysis; Journal Volume: 188; Journal Issue: 1; Other Information: PBD: 15 Nov 1999","","Medium: X; Size: page(s) 186-202","","","W-7405-ENG-82","Journal ID: ISSN 0021-9517; JCTLA5; TRN: IM200004%%79","10.1006/jcat.1999.2646","","2010-06-03T00:00:00Z","20003857","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/20003857","","Journal of Catalysis","1","188"

The effects of adsorption and diffusion of the reactants on methanol to olefins (MTO) and propene conversion over SAPO-34 have been studied in an oscillating microbalance reactor. The adsorption parameters of methanol and propene at reaction conditions (698 K) were determined by a pulse method, and the results were identical to the values obtained by extrapolation from low temperatures (323--398 K). Inverse uptake diffusion times were calculated form adsorption data at low temperatures, and these results were dependent on the temperature and the adsorbed amount. The inverse steady-state diffusion times calculated form the inverse uptake diffusion times were independent of the temperature and the adsorbed amount. The influence of diffusion on the reaction rates was estimated on the basis of the inverse steady-state diffusion times, using the Weisz-Prater criterion. The methanol conversion over SAPO-34 was influenced by diffusion of the reactant, while the propene conversion was not. A kinetic study revealed that both the rate constant and the site coverage of propene were much lower than that of methanol at 698 K. The deactivation behavior during the MTO reaction over SAPO-34 was studied by measuring both the adsorbed amount of methanol and the conversion at different coke contents. Catalyst deactivation was proposed to be due to a decreasing number of sites available for adsorption at high coke contents and a lower diffusivity, hence a lower effectiveness factor due to coke deposition.","","","Norwegian Univ. of Science and Technology, Trondheim (NO)","","","United States","1999-11-01T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: Industrial and Engineering Chemistry Research; Journal Volume: 38; Journal Issue: 11; Other Information: PBD: Nov 1999","","Medium: X; Size: page(s) 4241-4249","","","","Journal ID: ISSN 0888-5885; IECRED; TRN: IM200004%%104","10.1021/ie9807046","","2010-06-03T00:00:00Z","20003882","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/20003882","","Industrial and Engineering Chemistry Research","11","38"

The observed oscillatory molar product distribution in dependence on the number of C atoms can exactly be described by means of a numerical model.","","","Univ. of Erlangen-Nuernberg, Erlangen (DE)","","","United States","1999-10-25T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: Journal of Catalysis; Journal Volume: 187; Journal Issue: 2; Other Information: PBD: 25 Oct 1999","","Medium: X; Size: page(s) 348-357","","","","Journal ID: ISSN 0021-9517; JCTLA5; TRN: IM200004%%60","10.1006/jcat.1999.2623","","2010-06-03T00:00:00Z","20003838","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/20003838","","Journal of Catalysis","2","187"

The crystallochemical model of solid surfaces, CMSS, has been used to calculate the oxygen cation's bond energies in the spinels. For the NiMgAl spinels the activity and selectivity to propene increase with the increase in the Ni content. The Ni ions surrounded by oxygen in the spinel structure are proposed as active centers for oxidative dehydrogenation to propene. The NiCr spinel is more active but less selective than the NiMgAl spinels; the difference in catalytic behavior has been ascribed to different coordination of Ni ions in the two groups of the spinels and to the lower oxygen cation's bond energy in the NiCr spinel.","","","Polish Academy of Sciences, Krakow (PL)","","","United States","1999-10-25T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: Journal of Catalysis; Journal Volume: 187; Journal Issue: 2; Other Information: PBD: 25 Oct 1999","","Medium: X; Size: page(s) 410-418","","","","Journal ID: ISSN 0021-9517; JCTLA5; TRN: IM200004%%63","10.1006/jcat.1999.2626","","2010-06-03T00:00:00Z","20003841","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/20003841","","Journal of Catalysis","2","187"

However, little is known about the active sites at which the catalytic reactions take place. It may be possible to obtain a significant increase in the catalytic efficiency if the effects of certain material properties on the surface reactions could be quantified and optimized through the use of appropriate preparation techniques. Given that surface reactivity is often dependent upon surface structure and that the atomic level structure of the active sites in these catalysts is virtually unknown, we desire thin film samples consisting of a single magnesium vanadate phase and a well defined crystallographic orientation in order to reduce complexity and simplify the study of active sites. We report on the use of reactive RF sputter deposition to fabricate very highly oriented, stoichiometric Mg{sub 3}(VO{sub 4}){sub 2} thin films for use in these surface analysis studies. Deposition of samples onto amorphous substrates resulted in very poor crystallinity. However, deposition of Mg{sub 3}(VO{sub 4}){sub 2} onto well-oriented, lattice-matched thin film ''seed'' layers such as Ti(0001), Au(111), or Pt(111) resulted in very strong preferential (042) crystallographic orientation (pseudo-hexagonal oxygen planes parallel to the substrate). This strong preferential growth of the Mg{sub 3}VO{sub 4}{sub 2} suggests epitaxial (single-crystal) growth of this mixed metal oxide on the underlying metal seed layer. The effects of the seed layer material, deposition temperature, and post-deposition reactive treatments on thin film properties such as stoichiometry, crystallographic orientation, and chemical interactions will be discussed.","","OSTI as DE00014006","Sandia National Lab.

The geometric and electronic structures for all the present molecules have been calculated by means of the MP2 (frozen core)/6-311++G(2d,p) level of theory. On the basis of the optimized structures, the single point calculations of the energies are carried out at the CCSD(T) level with the same basis sets. Through the theoretical analysis of the simplified CH{sub 4}-NO{sub x} system instead of the experimental CH{sub 4}-O{sub 2}-NO system, the authors found the possible reaction path leading to C{sub 1}-oxygenates within all the barriers of less than 40 kcal/mol via CH{sub 3}O at 800 K. No{sub 2} has a higher activity for the hydrogen abstraction from methane than NO and O{sub 2}, though the calculated rate constants at 800 K indicate that this reaction is the rate-determining step in the conversion of methane to C{sub 1}-oxygenates.

The relative importance of homogeneous chemistry in the reactions is still a subject of active debate, and, in this paper, the gas-phase partial oxidation of methane was simulated using detailed chemical reaction mechanisms. The sensitivity of homogeneous chemistry to the addition of trace amounts of radical and molecular species was analyzed to evaluate both the possibility of heterogeneous assistance to gas-phase reactions and the effectiveness of different species which might be added as promoters of particular product selectivities. Seeding of reaction mixtures with 2% of radicals reduced the homogeneous ignition delay time by only 50% at 1,400 K. The delay was fairly insensitive to particular radical seeds because the radical pool adjusts rapidly.

Over the Ni/Al{sub 2}O{sub 3} catalyst, much smaller quantities of reversibly adsorbed CH{sub 4} and active carbon-containing species, originated from the CH{sub 4} molecule, which lead to CO formation were detected.

It is concluded that La{sub 2}O{sub 2}CO{sub 3}, which form by the interaction of La{sub 2}O{sub 3} and CO{sub 2}, may decompose to produce CO or provide oxygen species which react with carbon accumulated on Ni crystallites due to CH{sub 2} cracking to produce CO.

An explanation for this surprising inhibition has been sought by performing large-scale density functional theory calculations of the dissociative chemisorption of methane on Ni(100) and Ni(111) surfaces with and without preadsorbed potassium. The calculations show that the barrier for dissociation of methane is increased by about 0.2 eV when 0.125 ML potassium is preadsorbed on both nickel surfaces. In the transition state of the dissociating methane molecule a dipole moment is induced. It is shown that the increase of the barrier is largely given by the interaction between the induced dipole moment in the transition state and the electrostatic field induced by the potassium adatoms.","","","Technical Univ. of Denmark, Lyngby (DK)","","","United States","1999-10-01T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: Journal of Catalysis; Journal Volume: 187; Journal Issue: 1; Other Information: PBD: 1 Oct 1999","","Medium: X; Size: page 238-244","","","","Journal ID: ISSN 0021-9517; JCTLA5","10.1006/jcat.1999.2612","","2010-06-03T00:00:00Z","20000970","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/20000970","","Journal of Catalysis","1","187"

Experiments have been carried out at differential and finite conversions in order to compare deactivation under the pure feed to that in the presence of products. Under differential conversion, it was found that the degree of deactivation was related to the CO concentration, being particularly acute under CO/H{sub 2}. Under CO/H{sub 2}, there was a close correlation between activity loss and loss of Cu surface area, suggesting that an important cause of deactivation is sintering, which may be promoted by over-reduction of Cu. At finite conversion with CO/H{sub 2} feed the deactivation was less severe. This lower rate of deactivation is most likely due to exposure of the catalyst to products that can stabilize oxidized Cu species. Interestingly, under CO{sub 2}/H{sub 2}, the deactivation was apparent at finite conversion. The exposure of the catalyst to the products, CO and water, at finite conversion can explain these results.","","","Imperial Coll. of Science, London (GB)","","","United States","1999-10-01T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: Industrial and Engineering Chemistry Research; Journal Volume: 38; Journal Issue: 10; Other Information: PBD: Oct 1999","","Medium: X; Size: page 3868-3872","","","","Journal ID: ISSN 0888-5885; IECRED","10.1021/ie990078s","","2010-06-03T00:00:00Z","20000993","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/20000993","","Industrial and Engineering Chemistry Research","10","38"

Methods used were Fourier-transform infrared spectroscopy and temperature-programmed desorption and reaction (TPD and TPR). The decomposition of ethane and its reaction with CO{sub 2} have been studied in a fixed-bed continuous-flow reactor. IR measurements showed that ethane interacted strongly with the highly dispersed Rh above 206 K and gave rise to the formation of ethylidyne surface species very likely through the transient formation of ethylene. At 523--573 K, the decomposition of ethane produces hydrogen, methane, and propane. Above 623 K ethylene became the main product, but benzene and toluene were also detected. Independent of the temperature, the rate of the decomposition decayed after 5--10 min to a very low level (1--2% conversion), but it did not cease completely even after several hours (673 K). The reactivities of surface carbon formed at different temperatures toward H{sub 2}, O{sub 2}, and CO{sub 2} have been examined. Carbon exhibited the highest reactivity with O{sub 2} and less reactivity with CO{sub 2}. The peak temperatures of its reaction in TPR shifted to a higher temperature with the temperature of its production in all the three cases. Carbon formed at 773 K in the ethane decomposition reacted with CO{sub 2} at maximum rate at 973 K. The reaction between C{sub 2}H{sub 6} and CO{sub 2} occurred rapidly above 700 K to give mainly H{sub 2} and CO with a ratio of 0.3--0.6. In contrast with the CH{sub 4} + CO{sub 2} reaction on the same catalyst, a significant deactivation of the catalyst occurred at the stoichiometric CO{sub 2}/C{sup 2}H{sub 6} ratio. This feature is attributed to the low reactivity of hydrocarbon fragments formed by the decomposition of ethane compared to those produced by CH{sub 4} dissociation.

"Isotopic tracer and kinetic studies of oxidative dehydrogenation pathways on vanadium oxide catalysts","Chen, K; Khodakov, A; Yang, J; Bell, A T; Iglesia, E; ","03 NATURAL GAS; 10 SYNTHETIC FUELS; VANADIUM OXIDES; CATALYTIC EFFECTS; PROPANE; DEHYDROGENATION; OXIDATION; PROPYLENE; CHEMICAL REACTION KINETICS","Kinetic analysis and isotopic tracer studies were used to identify elementary steps and their reversibility in the oxidative dehydrogenation of propane on VO{sub x}/ZrO{sub 2} catalysts with VO{sub x} surface densities between 1.6 and 6 VO{sub x}/nm{sup 2}. Competitive reactions of C{sub 2}H{sub 6} and CH{sub 3}{sup 13}CH{sub 2}CH{sub 3} showed that CO forms via secondary combustion of propene intermediates. CO{sub 2} formed via this reaction and also via the direct combustion of propane. Reactions of {sup 18}O{sub 2}/C{sub 3}H{sub 8} mixtures on supported V{sub 2}{sup 16}O{sub 5} led to the preferential initial appearance of lattice {sup 16}O atoms in all oxygen-containing products, as expected if lattice oxygens were required for the activation of C-H bonds. Isotopically mixed O{sub 2} species were not detected during reactions of C{sub 3}H{sub 8}-{sup 18}O{sub 2}-{sup 16}O{sub 2} reactant mixtures. Therefore, dissociative O{sub 2} chemisorption steps are irreversible. Similarly, C{sub 2}H{sub 8}-C{sub 3}D{sub 8}-O{sub 2} reactants undergo oxidative dehydrogenation without forming C{sub 3}H{sub 8{minus}x}D{sub x} mixed isotopomers, suggesting that C-H bond activation steps are also irreversible. Normal kinetic isotopic effects (k{sub C-H}/k{sub C-D} = 2.5) were measured for primary oxidative dehydrogenation reactions. Kinetic isotope effects were slightly lower for propane and propene combustion steps (1.7 and 2.2, respectively). These data are consistent with kinetically relevant steps involving the dissociation of C-H bonds in propane and propene. C{sub 3}H{sub 6}-D{sub 2}O and C{sub 3}D{sub 6}-GH{sub 2}O cross exchange reactions occur readily during reaction; therefore, OH recombination steps are reversible and nearly equilibrated. These isotopic tracer results are consistent with a Mars-van Krevelen redox mechanism involving two lattice oxygens in irreversible C-H bond activation steps. The resulting alkyl species desorb as propene and the remaining O-H group recombines with neighboring OH groups to form water and reduced V centers. These reduced V centers reoxidize by irreversible dissociative chemisorption of O{sub 2} The application of pseudo-steady-state and reversibility assumptions leads to a complex kinetic rate expression that describes accurately the observed water inhibition effects and the kinetic orders in propane and oxygen when surface oxygen and OH groups are assumed to be the most abundant surface intermediates.","","","","USDOE, Washington, DC (United States)","","United States","1999-09-10T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: Journal of Catalysis; Journal Volume: 186; Journal Issue: 2; Other Information: PBD: 10 Sep 1999","","Medium: X; Size: pp. 325-333","","","AC03-76SF00098","Journal ID: JCTLA5; ISSN 0021-9517; TRN: IM9944%%408","10.1006/jcat.1999.2510","","2009-12-16T00:00:00Z","687743","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/687743","","Journal of Catalysis","2","186"
"Transient response of catalyst bed temperature in the pulsed reaction of partial oxidation of methane to synthesis gas over supported rhodium and iridium catalysts","Nakagawa, Kiyoharu; Ikenaga, Naoki; Suzuki, Toshimitsu; Teng, Yonghong; Kobayashi, Tetsuhiko","03 NATURAL GAS; 10 SYNTHETIC FUELS; METHANE; PARTIAL OXIDATION PROCESSES; SYNTHESIS GAS; RHODIUM; IRIDIUM; CATALYTIC EFFECTS; CHEMICAL REACTION KINETICS; CATALYSTS; TEMPERATURE MEASUREMENT; CATALYST SUPPORTS","Mechanisms of partial oxidation of methane were studied using a pulsed reaction technique and temperature jump measurement. Catalyst bed temperatures were directly measured by introducing a pulse of a mixture of methane and oxygen (2/1). With Ir/TiO{sub 2} catalyst, a sudden temperature increase at the front edge of the catalyst bed was observed upon introduction of the pulse, but the temperature of the rear end of the catalyst bed increased only slightly. The synthesis gas production basically proceeded via a two-step path consisting of highly exothermic methane complete oxidation to give H{sub 2}O and CO{sub 2}, followed by the endothermic reforming of methane with H{sub 2}O and CO{sub 2} over Ir/TiO{sub 2} catalyst. However, with Rh/TiO{sub 2} and Rh/Al{sub 2}O{sub 3} catalysts, the temperature at the front edge of the catalyst bed decreased upon introduction of the CH{sub 4}/O{sub 2} (2/1) pulse, and a small increase in the temperature at the rear end was observed. At first, endothermic decomposition of CH{sub 4} to H{sub 2} and deposited carbon or CH{sub x} probably took place at the front edge of the catalyst bed and then deposited carbon or generated CH{sub x} species would be oxidized into CO{sub x}. However, on Rh/SiO{sub 2}, synthesis gas was produced via a two-step path similar to the case of Ir/TiO{sub 2} catalyst. The reaction pathway of partial oxidation of methane with Rh-loaded catalysts depended strongly on the support materials.","","","","","","United States","1999-09-10T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: Journal of Catalysis; Journal Volume: 186; Journal Issue: 2; Other Information: PBD: 10 Sep 1999","","Medium: X; Size: pp. 405-413","","","","Journal ID: JCTLA5; ISSN 0021-9517; TRN: IM9944%%413","10.1006/jcat.1999.2576","","2009-12-16T00:00:00Z","687748","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/687748","","Journal of Catalysis","2","186"

The geometric and electronic structures for all the molecules along the four reaction channels have been calculated by means of the MP2/6-311 + G(2d, p) level of theory. On the basis of the optimized geometries in the gas phase, the single-point calculations of the energies on the point-charge model are carried out. The results indicate that the energetically favorable reaction paths to yield methanol and formaldehyde on the reduced SnO{sub 2} surface are via the reactant complex CH{sub 3}O-H{sub 2}O and via the secondary production of methanol oxidation, respectively. It is also found that CH{sub 3}O{sup {minus}} is a stable anion on the surface due to having the high barriers of about 70 kcal/mol in both hydrogen abstraction with O{sup {minus}} and thermal decomposition, which is favorable to yield methanol and also is consistent with X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) experiments.","","","Kansai Research Inst., Kyoto (JP)","","","United States","1999-09-05T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: International Journal of Quantum Chemistry; Journal Volume: 74; Journal Issue: 4; Other Information: PBD: 5 Sep 1999","","Medium: X; Size: page 423-433","","","","Journal ID: ISSN 0020-7608; IJQCB2","10.1002/(SICI)1097-461X(1999)74:4<423::AID-QUA6>3.0.CO;2-R","","2010-06-03T00:00:00Z","20000405","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/20000405","","International Journal of Quantum Chemistry","4","74"

The chemical state of surface and bulk vanadium was investigated as a function of the calcination temperature, V{sub 2}O{sub 5} loading, and the nature and content of alkali-metal additives. It is found that on the surface vanadium is present in the form of isolated vanadyl species or oligomeric vanadates, or as nanocrystalline V{sub 2}O{sub 5} and that V{sup 5+} and V{sup 4+} ions coexist in octahedral and tetrahedral coordination, while within the bulk of zirconia matrix, V{sup 4+} ions are stabilized in a V{sub x}Zr{sub 1{minus}x}O{sub 2} solid solution. Presence of the alkali-metal additives and water changes the dispersion of surface vanadium species favoring, in both cases, formation of mononuclear vanadyl surface complexes. Surface heterogeneity plays a vital role for the catalytic performance of V{sub 2}O{sub 5}/ZrO{sub 2} catalysts in oxidative dehydrogenation of propane. Catalytic properties are related to the nature of VO{sub x} surface species and correlates well with their reducibility. The maximum of catalytic activity was observed for catalysts with vanadia content between 3 and 5 mol %, for which octahedral polyvanadate surface species are dominant. It is proposed that the catalytic activity is affected by the nucleophilicity of bridging oxygen in V-O-V entities, modified by the adjacent alkali cations.","","","Jagiellonia Univ., Cracow (PL)","","","United States","1999-08-31T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: Langmuir; Journal Volume: 15; Journal Issue: 18; Conference: Third international symposium on effects of surface heterogeneity in adsorption and catalysis on solids, Torun (PL), 08/09/1998--08/16/1998; Other Information: PBD: 31 Aug 1999","","Medium: X; Size: page 5733-5741","","CONF-9808111-","","Journal ID: ISSN 0743-7463; LANGD5","10.1021/la981431m","","2010-06-03T00:00:00Z","20000515","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/20000515","","Langmuir","18","15"

"Partial oxidation of methane to synthesis gas over MgO- and SiO{sub 2}-supported rhodium catalysts","Wang, H Y; Ruckenstein, E","03 NATURAL GAS; 10 SYNTHETIC FUELS; METHANE; PARTIAL OXIDATION PROCESSES; SYNTHESIS GAS; MAGNESIUM OXIDES; SILICON OXIDES; CATALYTIC EFFECTS; RHODIUM; DEACTIVATION","The partial oxidation of methane over MgO- and SiO{sub 2}-supported rhodium catalysts was investigated, using a CH{sub 4}/O{sub 2} mixture with a molar ratio of 2.1/1 as feed gas. At 750 C and atmospheric pressure, the 1% Rh/MgO catalyst exhibited a very high stability at the high gas hourly space velocity of 720,000 ml/g h, its catalytic activity and selectivity remaining constant and high after an induction time up to 100 h of reaction. In contrast, the 1% Rh/SiO{sub 2} catalyst deactivated rapidly. To explain the above results, the reaction behaviors of CH{sub 4} and CH{sub 4}/O{sub 2} (2/1) over the oxidized catalysts 1% Rh(O)/MgO and 1% Rh(O)/SiO{sub 2} were studied in a pulse microreactor. No carbon deposition occurred during the reaction of CH{sub 4} with the MgO-supported rhodium catalyst, even after the catalyst was almost completely reduced. In contrast, a notable amount of surface carbon was generated during the reaction of CH{sub 4} with the SiO{sub 2}-supported rhodium catalyst, even after the catalyst was almost completely reduced. In contrast, a notable amount of surface carbon was generated during the reaction of CH{sub 4} with the SiO-supported rhodium catalyst. During the reaction of CH{sub 4}/O{sub 2} (2/1) over the oxidized catalysts, the rhodium oxide supported on SiO{sub 2} was easily reduced by CH{sub 4}, while the reduction of rhodium oxide supported on MgO occurred with some difficulty. This implies much stronger interactions between rhodium oxide and MgO than between the former and SiO{sub 2}. Temperature-programmed reduction experiments also revealed much stronger interactions between rhodium and magnesium oxide and that two kinds of rhodium compounds were present in the oxidized MgO-supported rhodium catalyst. X-ray powder diffraction enabled the authors to identify Rh{sub 2}O{sub 3} and MgRh{sub 2}O{sub 4} in precalcined 10% Rh(O)/SiO{sub 2} and 10% Rh(O)/MgO, respectively. It is suggested that the strong interactions between rhodium and magnesium oxide (especially the formation of MgRh{sub 2}O{sub 4}) are responsible for the high stability of the MgO-supported rhodium catalysts.","","","","","","United States","1999-08-15T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: Journal of Catalysis; Journal Volume: 186; Journal Issue: 1; Other Information: PBD: 15 Aug 1999","","Medium: X; Size: pp. 181-187","","","","Journal ID: JCTLA5; ISSN 0021-9517; TRN: IM9944%%399","10.1006/jcat.1999.2535","","2009-12-16T00:00:00Z","687734","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/687734","","Journal of Catalysis","1","186"
"Carbon dioxide as oxidant for the conversion of methane to ethane and ethylene using modified CeO{sub 2} catalysts","Wang, Y; Takahashi, Yoshimoto; Ohtsuka, Yasuo","03 NATURAL GAS; 10 SYNTHETIC FUELS; METHANE; REFORMER PROCESSES; CALCIUM OXIDES; CERIUM OXIDES; CATALYTIC EFFECTS; ETHYLENE; SYNTHESIS; CARBON DIOXIDE; OXIDIZERS","CaO-CeO{sub 2} is the most effective catalyst for the conversion at 850 C of CH{sub 4} to C{sub 2}H{sub 6} and C{sub 2}H{sub 4} by CO{sub 2} among a series of CeO{sub 2} catalysts modified with alkali and alkaline earth metal oxides. When the CaO-CeO{sub 2} catalyst is prepared in the range of Ca/Ce ratio 0.1--0.5 by impregnation method, there exist synergistic effects between the two components for the formation of C{sub 2} hydrocarbons, and the catalyst forms solid solution. It is thus suggested that the formation of solid solution is responsible for synergistic effects. The lattice oxygen of the CaO-CeO{sub 2} catalyst converts CH{sub 4} mainly to H{sub 2} and CO, and the presence of CO{sub 2} is indispensable for C{sub 2} formation. Both C{sub 2} selectivity and C{sub 2} yield increase remarkably with increasing partial pressure of CO{sub 2}, these values at 850 C reaching 75 and 4% at 70 kPa, respectively. Correlation of the results of kinetic analyses and CO{sub 2} TPD measurements indicates that the existence of the pool of the CO{sub 2} chemisorbed on the CaO-CeO{sub 2} catalyst accounts for high C{sub 2} selectivity and yield. The characterization of the binary catalyst show that bulk carbonates are not detectable during reaction and Ce{sup 3+} sites are formed at the outermost layer. It is speculated that these sites activate the chemisorbed CO{sub 2} to generate active oxygen species, which work for the conversion of CH{sub 4} to C{sub 2} hydrocarbons.","","","","","","United States","1999-08-15T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: Journal of Catalysis; Journal Volume: 186; Journal Issue: 1; Other Information: PBD: 15 Aug 1999","","Medium: X; Size: pp. 160-168","","","","Journal ID: JCTLA5; ISSN 0021-9517; TRN: IM9944%%397","10.1006/jcat.1999.2538","","2009-12-16T00:00:00Z","687732","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/687732","","Journal of Catalysis","1","186"

These fuels were: ortho-xylene-d{sub 0} and ortho-xylene=d{sub 10} (1:1); para-xylene-d{sub 0} and para-xylene-d{sub 10} (1:1); and meta-xylene-2,4,5,6-d{sub 4}. Isotopic distributions within the exhausted hydrocarbons establish the postflame chemistry involved. There is an isotope effect in the consumption of residual fuel in the postflame region. The residual fuel from each experiment exhibits minimal H-D exchange. Toluene is an intermediate in the formation of ethylbenzene, and is produced through X{sup {sm_bullet}} atom (X{sup {sm_bullet}} = H or D) displacement of methyl radicals from the xylene fuel. Benzene is formed by direct demethylation, but there are other routes. Styrene from o- and p-xylene fuels is formed intramolecularly, probably involving xylylene and methylcycloheptatetraene intermediates. Ethyltoluene is formed by combination of methyl and methylbenzyl radicals.","","","","","","United States","1999-08-01T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: Combustion and Flame; Journal Volume: 118; Journal Issue: 3; Other Information: PBD: Aug 1999","","Medium: X; Size: pp. 459-468","","","","Journal ID: CBFMAO; ISSN 0010-2180; TRN: IM9931%%257","10.1016/S0010-2180(99)00005-X","","2009-12-16T00:00:00Z","355736","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/355736","","Combustion and Flame","3","118"

The aim of the study is to establish the influences of material property variation and finite rate chemistry on the rate of spread and also to obtain the dependence of the chemistry factor on the oxygen mass fraction in the oxidizer flow. To this end, flame spread rates over samples inclined at various angles from the vertical direction are first measured in an oxygen environment and the results used to establish the sole influence of streamwise gravity on the spread process. A second set of flame spread tests are then performed using composites of various compositions within an oxidizer flow diluted with nitrogen. Finally, the results of both sets of experiments are incorporated into an existing flame spread rate formula to deduce the influences of material property variation and finite rate chemistry on the spread rate. The results show a good qualitative agreement with previous studies and produce new insights into the nature of the chemistry factor that can aid further development of the underlying theory.","","","","","","United States","1999-08-01T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: Combustion and Flame; Journal Volume: 118; Journal Issue: 3; Other Information: PBD: Aug 1999","","Medium: X; Size: pp. 317-326","","","","Journal ID: CBFMAO; ISSN 0010-2180; TRN: IM9931%%251","10.1016/S0010-2180(99)00007-3","","2009-12-16T00:00:00Z","355730","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/355730","","Combustion and Flame","3","118"
"Methane dehydrogenation and aromatization over Mo/HZSM-5: In situ FT-IR characterization of its acidity and the interaction between Mo species and HZSM-5","Liu, W; Xu, Y","03 NATURAL GAS; 10 SYNTHETIC FUELS; METHANE; DEHYDROGENATION; AROMATIZATION; MOLYBDENUM; ZEOLITES; CATALYTIC EFFECTS; CONFIGURATION INTERACTION; CATALYSTS; CATALYST SUPPORTS","The acid sites of Mo/HZSM-5 and the interaction between Mo species and HZSM-5 have been characterized by in situ FT-IR spectroscopy using pyridine as the probe molecule. The results reveal that Mo species are mainly located on OH groups associated with silanol groups and bridged hydroxyl groups, Si(OH)Al. This is shown by the decrease in the intensities of their stretching modes at 3,740 and 3,618 cm{sup {minus}1}. On a 6 wt% Mo/HZSM-5 sample, the relative intensity of the band at 3,618 cm{sup {minus}1} decreases about 80%, and the band at 3,740 cm{sup {minus}1} decreases about 65%. Thus, the Mo species preferably locate on the Broensted acid sites after calcination at 773 K. FT-IR characterization of adsorbed pyridine shows that both Broensted and Lewis acid sites are present in all Mo/HZSM-5 samples. The relative integrated intensities of the bands of pyridine adsorbed on the Broensted and Lewis acid sites, as well as the ratio of the Broensted and Lewis acid sites concentration, [L]/[B], are estimated as a function of Mo loading. The strength distribution, investigated with stepwise evacuation under different desorption temperatures, is broader on Lewis acid sites than on Broensted acid sites. An increase in the intensity of the band at 1,549 cm{sup {minus}1} is observed with the 15 wt% Mo/HZSM-5 sample, suggesting that new Lewis and Broensted acid sites are generated. Combining the FT-IR study with previous catalytic evaluation, it is concluded that Mo/HZSM-5 is a bifunctional catalyst and that a certain amount (about 60%) of the original Broensted acid sites on HZSM-5 kept free on the surface may be necessary for its good catalytic performance in methane dehydrogenation and aromatization.","","","","","","United States","1999-07-25T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: Journal of Catalysis; Journal Volume: 185; Journal Issue: 2; Other Information: PBD: 25 Jul 1999","","Medium: X; Size: pp. 386-392","","","","Journal ID: JCTLA5; ISSN 0021-9517; TRN: IM9943%%274","10.1006/jcat.1999.2515","","2009-12-16T00:00:00Z","684583","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/684583","","Journal of Catalysis","2","185"

MCM-22 has been synthesized and dealuminated by hydrothermal treatments. The resulting solids were characterized by different techniques in order to know how the acid properties of the dealuminated solids were modified. It appears that the number of acid sites was decreased by hydrothermal treatments but the acid strength was not modified. Nondealuminated and dealuminated solids were used in the n-octane hydroconversion. Results suggested that for both types of solids the hydroisomerization is mainly occurring in the 10-membered ring (MR) channels whereas the hydrocracking is mainly coming from acid sites located in 12-membered ring channels. According to the observed distribution of monobranched isomers, MCM-22 shows some ``shape-selective`` character typical of the pentasil family, whereas, according to the absolute yield of isopentane in the hydrocracked products at low hydrocracking conversions, MCM-22 behaves more like a 12 MR zeolite.","","","","","","United States","1999-07-25T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: Journal of Catalysis; Journal Volume: 185; Journal Issue: 2; Other Information: PBD: 25 Jul 1999","","Medium: X; Size: pp. 378-385","","","","Journal ID: JCTLA5; ISSN 0021-9517; TRN: IM9943%%273","10.1006/jcat.1999.2475","","2009-12-16T00:00:00Z","684582","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/684582","","Journal of Catalysis","2","185"

X-ray diffraction and elemental analysis of physical mixtures treated in air indicate that MoO{sub x} species migrate onto the external ZSM5 surface at about 623 K. Between 773 and 973 K, MoO{sub x} species migrate inside zeolite channels via surface and gas phase transport, exchange at acid sites, and react to form H{sub 2}O. The amount of H{sub 2}O evolved during exchange and the amount of residual OH groups detected by isotopic equilibration with D{sub 2} showed that each Mo atom replaces one H{sup +} during exchange. This stoichiometry and the requirement for charge compensation suggest that exchanged species consist of (Mo{sub 2}O{sub 5}){sup 2+} ditetrahedral structures interacting with two cation exchange sites. The proposed mechanism may provide a general framework to describe the exchange of multivalent cations onto Al sites in zeolites. As the Mo concentration exceeds that required to form a MoO{sub x} monolayer on the external zeolite surface ({approximately}4 wt % Mo for the H-ZSM5 used), Mo species sublime as (MoO{sub 3}){sub n} oligomers or extract Al from the zeolite framework to form inactive Al{sub 2}(MoO{sub 4}){sub 3} domains detectable by {sup 27}Al NMR. These (Mo{sub 2}O{sub 5}){sup 2+} species reduce to form the active MoC{sub x} species during the initial stages of CH{sub 4} conversion reactions. Optimum CH{sub 4} aromatization rates were obtained on catalysts with intermediate MO contents ({approximately}0.4 Mo/Al), because both MoC{sub x} and acid sites are required to active CH{sub 4} and to convert the initial C{sub 2}H{sub 4} products into C{sub 6+} aromatics favored by thermodynamics.","","","","USDOE, Washington, DC (United States); National Science Foundation, Washington, DC (United States); Korea Science and Engineering Foundation (Korea, Republic of)","","United States","1999-07-15T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: Journal of Physical Chemistry B: Materials, Surfaces, Interfaces, amp Biophysical; Journal Volume: 103; Journal Issue: 28; Other Information: PBD: 15 Jul 1999","","Medium: X; Size: pp. 5785-5796","","","AC03-76SF00098","Journal ID: JPCBFK; ISSN 1089-5647; TRN: IM9942%%99","10.1021/jp990866v","","2016-05-25T00:00:00Z","682114","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/682114","","Journal of Physical Chemistry B: Materials, Surfaces, Interfaces, amp Biophysical","28","103"

There are two initiation steps involved in the combustion of DME, one involving C-O bond fission and the other involving hydrogen abstraction by molecular oxygen. The kinetics and thermodynamics of C-O bond fission were explored computationally in a previous paper. The present paper addresses the competing process--hydrogen abstraction by molecular oxygen. Ab initio molecular orbital calculations are used to study the structures and energetics of the reactants, products, and the transition state for the CH{sub 3}OCH{sub 3} + O{sub 2} reaction. The calculations predict a barrier for hydrogen abstraction from CH{sub 3}OCH{sub 3} by O{sub 2} of 47.4 kcal/mol. This is lower than the barrier height for C-O bond fission previously calculated to be 81.1 kcal/mol. The results support values used in current models for the combustion of DME. Moreover, an examination of rates for C-O bond fission versus hydrogen abstraction by O{sub 2} suggests that the bimolecular process is the dominant pathway.","","","","","","United States","1999-07-01T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: Combustion and Flame; Journal Volume: 118; Journal Issue: 1-2; Other Information: PBD: Jul 1999","","Medium: X; Size: pp. 312-316","","","","Journal ID: CBFMAO; ISSN 0010-2180; TRN: IM9931%%250","10.1016/S0010-2180(99)00009-7","","2009-12-16T00:00:00Z","355729","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/355729","","Combustion and Flame","1-2","118"

Effects of reaction parameters on catalytic activity and carbon deposition over Ni/{gamma}-Al{sub 2}O{sub 3} catalysts were investigated. It is found that reduced NiAl{sub 2}O{sub 4}, metal nickel, and active species of carbon deposited were the active sites for this reaction. Carbon deposition on Ni/{gamma}-Al{sub 2}O{sub 3} varied depending on the nickel loading and reaction temperature and is the major cause of catalyst deactivation. Higher nickel loading produced more coke on the catalysts, resulting in rapid deactivation and plugging of the reactor. At 5 wt % Ni/{gamma}-Al{sub 2}O{sub 3} catalyst exhibited high activity and much lesser magnitude of deactivation in 140 h. Characterization of carbon deposits on the catalyst surface revealed that there are two kinds of carbon species (oxidized and -C-C-) formed during the reaction and they showed different reactivities toward hydrogenation and oxidation. Kinetic studies showed that the activation energy for CO production in this reaction amounted to 80 kJ/mol and the rate of CO production could be described by a Langmuir-Hinshelwood model.","","","","","","United States","1999-07-01T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: Industrial and Engineering Chemistry Research; Journal Volume: 38; Journal Issue: 7; Other Information: PBD: Jul 1999","","Medium: X; Size: pp. 2615-2625","","","","Journal ID: IECRED; ISSN 0888-5885; TRN: IM9941%%118","10.1021/ie980489t","","2009-12-16T00:00:00Z","680077","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/680077","","Industrial and Engineering Chemistry Research","7","38"

With increasing zirconium content the strong interaction between silica and cobalt is reduced and a somewhat weaker cobalt-zirconium interaction is observed. Therefore the degree of reduction of catalysts, which were reduced at 400 C for 16 h, increases strongly. The cobalt crystallite size increases with increasing zirconium content, leading to smaller cobalt metal surface areas for the freshly reduced catalyst. Cobalt particles can be found in clusters on the silica support. The size of cobalt clusters decreases and thus the number of cobalt particles within a cluster decreases with increasing zirconium content. At steady-state conditions the CO-conversion of the promoted catalyst in the Fischer-Tropsch synthesis increases with increasing zirconium content. The C{sub 5+}-selectivity and the secondary hydrogenation activity pass a maximum with increasing zirconium content. The observed changes in activity and selectivity are explained in terms of an increase in the amount of metallic cobalt available under reaction conditions, leading to an increased activity, and a decrease in the cobalt cluster size, which diminishes the probability for secondary reactions. Furthermore, it was concluded that secondary double bond isomerization can be catalyzed to some extent by zirconia.","","","","","","United States","1999-07-01T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: Journal of Catalysis; Journal Volume: 185; Journal Issue: 1; Other Information: PBD: 1 Jul 1999","","Medium: X; Size: pp. 120-130","","","","Journal ID: JCTLA5; ISSN 0021-9517; TRN: IM9943%%261","10.1006/jcat.1999.2497","","2009-12-16T00:00:00Z","684570","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/684570","","Journal of Catalysis","1","185"

In the presence of adsorbed oxygen, oxygen at metal on-top sites promotes methane dehydrogenation; oxygen at hollow sites promotes methane dehydrogenation on Pt, Cu, Ag, and Au, but shows no such effect on the other transition metals. The difference in the H{sub 2} selectivities can be associated with the difference in the stabilities of OH on the metals. For CH{sub x} couplings, the trend in the calculated combination energies is in agreement with experimental observation.","","","","","","United States","1999-07-01T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: Journal of Catalysis; Journal Volume: 185; Journal Issue: 1; Other Information: PBD: 1 Jul 1999","","Medium: X; Size: pp. 12-22","","","","Journal ID: JCTLA5; ISSN 0021-9517; TRN: IM9943%%255","10.1006/jcat.1999.2498","","2009-12-16T00:00:00Z","684564","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/684564","","Journal of Catalysis","1","185"

We analyzed the full-fuel-cycle GHG effects of corn-based ethanol using updated information on corn operations in the upper Midwest and existing ethanol production technologies. Information was obtained from representatives of the U.S. Department of Agriculture, faculty of midwestern universities with expertise in corn production and animal feed, and acknowledged authorities in the field of ethanol plant engineering, design, and operations. Cases examined included use of E85 (85% ethanol and 15% gasoline by volume) and E10 (10% ethanol and 90% gasoline). Among key findings is that Midwest-produced ethanol outperforms conventional (current) and reformulated (future) gasoline with respect to energy use and GHG emissions (on a mass emission per travel mile basis). The superiority of the energy and GHG results is well outside the range of model noise. An important facet of this work has been conducting sensitivity analyses. These analyses let us rank the factors in the corn-to-ethanol cycle that are most important for limiting GHG generation. These rankings could help ensure that efforts to reduce that generation are targeted more effectively.","","","Argonne National Lab.

It is found that the chemical behavior of Ru depends strongly on the material on which it is supported. Over Al{sub 2}O{sub 3}, ruthenium is incompletely reduced by treatment with hydrogen at 573 and 823 K, while oxidized Ru species are also detected following exposure of the catalyst to a methane-oxygen mixture at 773 and 973 K. In contrast, over TiO{sub 2}, ruthenium is more easily reduced and is stabilized in its reduced state following hydrogen treatment at 823 K. During treatment with the methane-oxygen mixture, no reoxidation of Ru occurs. The interaction between Ru and TiO{sub 2}, which inhibits the oxidation of ruthenium under conditions of partial oxidation of methane, is related to the unique ability of the Ru/TiO{sub 2} catalyst to promote the direct route of synthesis gas formation.","","","","","","United States","1999-06-24T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: Journal of Physical Chemistry B: Materials, Surfaces, Interfaces, amp Biophysical; Journal Volume: 103; Journal Issue: 25; Other Information: PBD: 24 Jun 1999","","Medium: X; Size: pp. 5227-5239","","","","Journal ID: JPCBFK; ISSN 1089-5647; TRN: IM9942%%83","10.1021/jp9842291","","2009-12-16T00:00:00Z","682098","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/682098","","Journal of Physical Chemistry B: Materials, Surfaces, Interfaces, amp Biophysical","25","103"

Process parameters such as temperature, feed composition of 1-butene and oxygen, and feed flow rates were varied to study their effect on the activity and selectivity toward the oxidative dehydrogenation process. In addition to process parameters, modifications in the catalyst such as the ion-exchange of tunnel cations and framework substitution of manganese cations were also implemented in order to observe their effects on catalytic activity and the selectivity of 1,3-butadiene production. The ion-exchanged OMS and OL materials showed rapid deactivation with time when subjected to reaction mixtures of 1% 1-butene/0.7% oxygen/Ar and 1% 1-butene/1.1% oxygen/Ar at reaction temperatures greater than 400 C. Their selectivity toward 1,3-butadiene were typically from 15--20% (yield of 4--6%). The other products were cis and trans 2-butene and carbon dioxide and water (40--60% selectivity). Much of the oxidation was therefore nonselective. XRD data have shown that there is a phase change of the original precursor to a mixture of Mn{sub 3}O{sub 4}/MnO or plain MnO, in some cases after exposing the catalyst to reaction conditions for about 1--2 h. Framework substitution of some of the manganese with copper (OMS and OL), however, has led to higher yields and selectivities toward 1,3-butadiene. [Cu] OL-1 showed a yield of 11.8% and a maximum selectivity of 26% toward 1,3-butadiene. [Cu] OMS-1 shows a dramatically high selectivity of 36% and a yield of 11% toward 1,3-butadiene. The effect of framework substitution seems to also impede the phase change to Mn{sub 3}O{sub 4} (Hausmannite). The TPR spectra also show an increase in the lattice oxygen peak by about 40 C, in comparison with ion-exchanged OMS. This is sufficient indication that framework substitution of manganese by copper, partially, has enhanced the stability of the catalyst and improved its capacity for selective oxidation.","","","","","","United States","1999-06-10T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: Journal of Catalysis; Journal Volume: 184; Journal Issue: 2; Other Information: PBD: 10 Jun 1999","","Medium: X; Size: pp. 305-315","","","","Journal ID: JCTLA5; ISSN 0021-9517; TRN: IM9933%%441","10.1006/jcat.1999.2460","","2009-12-16T00:00:00Z","362057","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/362057","","Journal of Catalysis","2","184"

In the case of Cu/SiO{sub 2}, methanol exposure results in the formation of methoxide species on Cu and SiO{sub 2} at 323 K. In the absence of methanol in the gas phase, methoxide species on Cu are dehydrogenated to give formaldehyde starting at {approximately}340 K and are oxidized to formate species at {approximately} 373 K, which then decomposed to CO{sub 2} and H{sub 2} at {approximately}390 K. When methanol is present in the gas phase, methyl formate, CO, and H{sub 2}. resulting from the decomposition of methyl formate, are formed in addition to the above reactions. When ZrO{sub 2}/SiO{sub 2} or Cu/ZrO{sub 2}/SiO{sub 2} is exposed to methanol, the majority of the surface species observed are associated with zirconia. Methanol adsorption on either ZrO{sub 2}/SiO{sub 2} or Cu/ZrO{sub 2}/SiO{sub 2} leads to methoxide formation on zirconia and SiO{sub 2} at 323 K. In the presence of Cu, methoxide species on zirconia are dehydrogenated to give formaldehyde starting at {approximately}325 K, which is oxidized to formate species on zirconia at {approximately}373 K, which decompose to CO, CO{sub 2}, and H{sub 2} at {approximately}400 K. Methyl formate and dimethyl ether are also observed to form above 460 K. In the absence of Cu, methoxide species on zirconia decompose only very slowly at 523 K. Metallic Cu is proposed to provide sites on which hydrogen atoms formed during the dehydrogenation of species located on zirconia can recombine efficiently and desorb as H{sub 2}. Thus, methanol decomposition over Cu/ZrO{sub 2}/SiO{sub 2} is envisioned to occur primarily on ZrO{sub 2}, with the primary function of Cu being the removal of hydrogen.","","","","USDOE, Washington, DC (United States)","","United States","1999-06-10T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: Journal of Catalysis; Journal Volume: 184; Journal Issue: 2; Other Information: PBD: 10 Jun 1999","","Medium: X; Size: pp. 357-376","","","AC03-76SF00098","Journal ID: JCTLA5; ISSN 0021-9517; TRN: IM9933%%443","10.1006/jcat.1999.2420","","2009-12-16T00:00:00Z","362059","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/362059","","Journal of Catalysis","2","184"

Many catalysts were tested in this reaction. Nickel powder, iron powder, and activated carbon were the most active and efficient catalysts for the production of higher hydrocarbons. When helium was used as a diluent gas and the applied power was optimized, the selectivities were controlled to the most desired products. Iron powder was active only at high power (1130 W). At these conditions acetylene was avoided and ethylene and ethane were produced in the same proportion. At low power (378 W) with nickel powder as catalyst and no diluent, ethane was the major C{sub 2} hydrocarbon. The amount of acetylene increased when arcing was observed. The proportion of C{sub 2} products changed from ethane > ethylene > acetylene to ethylene > acetylene > ethane when the power was increased from 378 to 1130 W. The major product was CO when high power (2230 W) was used. Selectivities toward C{sub 3s} and C{sub 4s} were enhanced to 16 and 18%, respectively, and the major products were propane and methylpropane when He was used as a diluent gas. Activated carbon catalysts and helium diluent led to a product distribution of C{sub 2s} of ethylene > acetylene > ethane at low applied power (378 W). At medium power (754 W) as time increases, the selectivities to C{sub 2s} decrease and the selectivity to benzene increases to 33%. Some manganese oxides such as OMS-1, OMS-2, and MnO{sub 2} (dielectric constant, {epsilon} {approx} 10{sup 4}) were not active in these reactions. These data suggest that the dielectric constant is not the most important factor in the oligomerization of methane via microwave heating. Conversion and activities of these materials are not proportionally related to the surface area of the catalysts.","","","","","","United States","1999-06-03T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: Journal of Physical Chemistry A: Molecules, Spectroscopy, Kinetics, Environment, amp General Theory; Journal Volume: 103; Journal Issue: 22; Other Information: PBD: 3 Jun 1999","","Medium: X; Size: pp. 4332-4340","","","","Journal ID: JPCAFH; ISSN 1089-5639; TRN: IM9927%%107","10.1021/jp984671j","","2009-12-16T00:00:00Z","351582","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/351582","","Journal of Physical Chemistry A: Molecules, Spectroscopy, Kinetics, Environment, amp General Theory","22","103"

The effect of varying the temperature of cooling water on HC emissions was also investigated under three fuel/air equivalence ratios (lean, stoichiometric, and rich). Results show that retarding ignition timing with respect to maximum break torque (MBT) has a great effect on HC emissions reduction, where for lean mixture, {Phi} = 0.85, retarding ignition timing by 6 degrees from MBT reduces the exhaust HC emissions by 12%. The level of HC emissions is also reduced by 30% at MBT, as the cooling water temperature increase from 55 to 90 C. It is noticed that as the engine speed increases, the level of HC emissions decrease.","","","","","","United States","1999-06-01T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: Energy Sources; Journal Volume: 21; Journal Issue: 5; Other Information: PBD: Jun 1999","","Medium: X; Size: pp. 379-394","","","","Journal ID: EGYSAO; ISSN 0090-8312; TRN: IM9926%%107","10.1080/00908319950014704","","2009-12-16T00:00:00Z","350298","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/350298","","Energy Sources","5","21"

Experiments are conducted at a nominal methanol feed concentration of 0.88 mol % (1.53 wt %) using H{sub 2}O{sub 2} as an initial oxidant. In some experiments, the O{sub 2}/MeOH molar ratios are varied from 1.5 to 3.0 and show that the rate of methanol oxidation is independent of the oxygen initial feed concentration.

The identified reaction products are mainly CO and CO{sub 2}. The temporal variation of the CO yield exhibits a maximum at temperatures of 723 and 748 K, whereas the CO{sub 2} yield increases monotonically over the experimental range of residence time (3--50 s).

"Homogenous conversion of methane to methanol. 1: Catalytic activation and functionalization of methane by cis-platin in sulfuric acid -- a density functional study of the thermochemistry","Mylvaganam, K; Bacskay, G B; Hush, N S","03 NATURAL GAS; 10 SYNTHETIC FUELS; HOMOGENEOUS CATALYSIS; HETEROCYCLIC COMPOUNDS; CHEMICAL ACTIVATION; PRESSURE DEPENDENCE; MOLECULAR STRUCTURE; METHANE; METHANOL; OXIDATION; REFORMER PROCESSES; PLATINUM COMPOUNDS; CATALYTIC EFFECTS","The selective oxidation of methane to methanol or other efficiently transportable material represents one of the outstanding challenges of the chemical industry. Methane, being the dominant component of natural gas, is an abundant resource, yet in comparison with petroleum products it is currently underutilized, mainly because the transportation of a gas with a very low boiling point is expensive. The situation could change drastically if a simple, efficient, and economical method were found to convert methane to a readily transportable material such as methanol. The recent announcement by Periana et al. (Science, 1998, 280, 560) of 70% one-pass homogeneous catalysis of methane-to-methanol conversion with high selectivity in sulfuric acid solution under moderate conditions represents an important advance in the selective oxidation of alkanes, an area of considerable current interest and activity. The conversion is catalyzed by bis(2,2{prime}-bipyrimidine)Pt(II)Cl{sub 2}. In this work, the thermodynamics of the activation and functionalization steps of the related cis-platin-catalyzed process in H{sub 2}SO{sub 4} are calculated using density functional techniques, including the calculation of solvation free energies by a dielectric continuum method. It is concluded that electrophilic attack by CH{sub 4} on an intermediate which may be regarded as a tetracoordinate solvated analogue of a gas-phase, T-shaped, three-coordinate Pt(II) species, followed by oxidation of the resulting methyl complex to a methyl bisulfate ester, is thermodynamically feasible. This is in general accord with the mechanism proposed by Periana et al., but now, on the basis of the computational predictions, the nature of the active catalyst, as well as that of the intermediates, can be more precisely defined. While the alternative mechanism of oxidative addition does not appear to be thermodynamically feasible when using Pt(II) catalysts, catalysis by a Pt(IV) species is predicted to be, on thermodynamic grounds, a viable alternative pathway.","","","","","","United States","1999-05-19T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: Journal of the American Chemical Society; Journal Volume: 121; Journal Issue: 19; Other Information: PBD: 19 May 1999","","Medium: X; Size: pp. 4633-4639","","","","Journal ID: JACSAT; ISSN 0002-7863; TRN: IM9942%%43","10.1021/ja983753i","","2009-12-16T00:00:00Z","682058","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/682058","","Journal of the American Chemical Society","19","121"

While ZrO{sub 2} and TiO{sub 2} individually enhance the methanol synthesis activity of Cu/SiO{sub 2}, a significantly greater enhancement is achieved by addition of both oxides simultaneously. In the absence of oxide addition, infrared spectra taken under reaction conditions suggest that methanol synthesis from CO{sub 2} takes place on the surface of Cu exclusively. When ZrO{sub 2} is added to the catalyst, there is strong evidence for methanol synthesis on the surface of both Cu and ZrO{sub 2}. Catalysis on the surface of ZrO{sub 2} occurs as a consequence of CO{sub 2} adsorption to form b-HCO{sub 3}-Zr, which then undergoes progressive hydrogenation to form methanol. The required atomic hydrogen is supplied from the surface of Cu particles by spillover. When TiO{sub 2} is added there is no evidence for catalysis occurring on the oxide surface, but strong evidence for an enhancement in the level of reaction occurring on the surface of Cu. The observed increase in the rate of methanol synthesis is attributed to a reconstruction of the Cu particles to expose the (100) surface, which have been demonstrated to be significantly more active than the (110) or (111) surfaces. The infrared spectra observed when a mixture of ZrO{sub 2} and TiO{sub 2} is added to Cu/SiO{sub 2} resembles a composite of the spectra observed upon addition of the individual oxides, and hence, the enhanced rate of methanol synthesis is ascribed to the combined effects of ZrO{sub 2} and TiO{sub 2}.","","","","USDOE, Washington, DC (United States)","","United States","1999-05-15T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: Journal of Catalysis; Journal Volume: 184; Journal Issue: 1; Other Information: PBD: 15 May 1999","","Medium: X; Size: pp. 144-156","","","AC03-76SF00098","Journal ID: JCTLA5; ISSN 0021-9517; TRN: IM9930%%126","10.1006/jcat.1999.2434","","2009-12-16T00:00:00Z","354385","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/354385","","Journal of Catalysis","1","184"

Mo existed as a dispersed phase over the alumina support, which, following reduction, was present as exposed isolated Mo{sup 2+} ions and as a surface layer on Rh particles which reduced the latter`s propensity to adsorb CO. Methane underwent decomposition at 673 K to generate C{sub x}H and other hydrocarbonaceous species which blocked surface sites on Rh/Mo/Al{sub 2}O{sub 3} in the order bridging sites on Rh, Rh gem-dicarbonyl, Mo{sup 2+}, and Rh on-top sites. A further proportion of the coke generated was located on the alumina support surface. Subsequent hydrogenation of the coked Rh/Mo/Al{sub 2}O{sub 3} catalyst showed two maxima in product formation, the first between room temperature and 350 K and the second between 375 and 475 K, whereas methane was detected only at ca. 473 K for Rh/Al{sub 2}O{sub 3} in the absence of Mo. The presence of Mo in the Rh/Al{sub 2}O{sub 3} catalyst enhances the extent to which coke removal takes place in hydrogen at low temperatures, possibly by restricting the mobility, and thus the ageing, of the residues. Restructuring of the carbonaceous residues occurs in the presence of CO for Rh/Al{sub 2}O{sub 3} but is less significant for Rh/Mo/Al{sub 2}O{sub 3}.","","","","","","United States","1999-05-15T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: Journal of Catalysis; Journal Volume: 184; Journal Issue: 1; Other Information: PBD: 15 May 1999","","Medium: X; Size: pp. 213-223","","","","Journal ID: JCTLA5; ISSN 0021-9517; TRN: IM9930%%130","10.1006/jcat.1999.2432","","2009-12-16T00:00:00Z","354389","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/354389","","Journal of Catalysis","1","184"

Transient kinetic analysis and temporal analysis of products were used to unravel the reaction mechanism and point out the specificity of each support. Over silica support, the most inert material, the whole reforming process occurs on the ruthenium phase and the fast ageing of the catalyst is related to a large residence time of surface carbon intermediates favoring polymerization and graphitization. Over graphite the support acts as a collector of CH{sub x} species which reduces the residence time of carbon species on the Ru phase and therefore leads to a very stable catalyst. Over alumina support the dry reforming of methane involves a complex reaction network in which the alumina hydroxyl groups feed continuously the active Ru phase in H and O adspecies, which also limits the catalyst ageing. Accumulation of CO{sub x} adspecies on alumina also occurs during the reaction.","","","","","","United States","1999-05-15T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: Journal of Catalysis; Journal Volume: 184; Journal Issue: 1; Other Information: PBD: 15 May 1999","","Medium: X; Size: pp. 202-212","","","","Journal ID: JCTLA5; ISSN 0021-9517; TRN: IM9930%%129","10.1006/jcat.1999.2439","","2009-12-16T00:00:00Z","354388","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/354388","","Journal of Catalysis","1","184"

The major reaction products are two conformers of methoxymethanol (5). IR absorptions of the products were assigned by isotopic labeling ({sup 18}O and D) and DFT calculations at the B3LYP/6-311++G(d,p) level of theory. The mechanism of the formation of 5, in particular H abstraction from 1 by atomic oxygen (O{sup 3}P and O{sup 1}D), was investigated using UMP, UCCSD(T), and UDFT. In both the H abstraction and the O({sup 1}D) insertion reaction, the out-of-plane C-H bonds of 1 are preferentially attacked since the in-plane C-H bonds are about 10 kcal/mol stronger. In the case of a reaction with O({sup 3}P), an Arrhenius activation energy of 3.5 kcal/mol is calculated at 298 K, which compares well with an experimental value of 2.85 kcal/mol. In the exit channel of the reaction, a radical-radical complex between CH{sub 3}CH{sub 2}{center_dot} and {center_dot}OH ({minus}2.7 kcal/mol relative to separated products) is found.

The experiments were performed at 800 C by applying a methane to oxygen ratio of 2:1. The contact times in the draft tube ({much_lt} 0.1 g {center_dot} s/mL) were sufficient to obtain nearly thermodynamic equilibrium values for the methane conversion (X{sub CH{sub 4}eq} = 92%) and selectivities to hydrogen (S{sub H{sub 2},eq} = 97%) and carbon dioxide (S{sub CO,eq} = 97%). The achieved results indicate the general suitability of an ICFB reactor for the partial oxidation of methane to synthesis gas. However, stable and controllable reactor operation with sufficient solids circulation through the draft tube was possible only over a narrow range of gas velocities (0.75--1.50 m/s). Furthermore, the conversion and selectivities were strongly influenced by the temperature distribution in the ICFB reactor. Especially, the decrease of temperature in the top of the draft tube and in the fountain region promoted backreactions reducing the conversion of methane. Furthermore, catalyst deactivation due to carbon depositions occurred in the ICFB reactor. This effect caused for the 1 wt % Ni catalyst a significant drop of the activity during 150 h of time on stream. The methane conversion decreased in the range of 12% for a catalyst particle fraction of 71--160 {micro}m. It was shown by TEM that two different types of carbon (encapsulating and whisker carbon) were deposited on the surface. The first species resulted in a reversible deactivation (activation of the catalyst by carbon dioxide in the reverse Boudouard reaction was partially possible), whereas the second species resulted in an irreversible deactivation due to a Ni loss by removing the carbon fibers which had Ni sites on top of the filament.","","","","","","United States","1999-05-01T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: Industrial and Engineering Chemistry Research; Journal Volume: 38; Journal Issue: 5; Other Information: PBD: May 1999","","Medium: X; Size: pp. 1813-1821","","","","Journal ID: IECRED; ISSN 0888-5885; TRN: IM9928%%255","10.1021/ie9806646","","2009-12-16T00:00:00Z","352661","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/352661","","Industrial and Engineering Chemistry Research","5","38"

The surface structures of these catalysts in hydrated and dehydrated states were characterized by in situ Raman and UV-vis-near-infrared diffuse reflectance spectroscopies. Temperature-programmed reduction and methanol oxidation were employed as chemical probe reactions to examine the reducibility and reactivity/selectivity properties of these catalysts. These characterization techniques demonstrate that both zirconium oxide and vanadium oxide species are highly dispersed as two-dimensional metal oxide overlayers on the silica support. The spectroscopic results revealed that the surface vanadium oxide species on the highly dispersed ZrO{sub 2}/SiO{sub 2} supports are predominantly isolated VO{sub 4} units [O{double_bond}V(O-Support){sub 3}] in the dehydrated state and become polymerized vanadium oxide species upon hydration. The surface vanadium oxide species preferentially interact with the zirconium oxide species on the silica surface. The substitution of Si{sup IV}-O{sup {minus}} by Zr{sup IV}-O{sup {minus}} ligands significantly affects the chemical properties of the isolated VO{sub 4} units: the reducibility of the surface vanadium oxide species increases, and the methanol oxidation turnover frequency (TOF) increases by 1--2 orders of magnitude relative to V{sub 2}O{sub 5}/SiO{sub 2}.

Temperature-programmed oxidation (TPO) experiments performed after hydrogenation steps of various durations show that the hydrogenation of a carbonaceous deposit obtained at 300 C on the reference Pt/SiO{sub 2} catalyst EUROPt-1 is not a fast process. Two groups of surface carbonaceous species have been characterized through their different reactivities toward oxygen, but at 300 C their reactivities toward hydrogen are similar. Among alkanes up to C{sub 5}, methane is the main product of hydrogenation, corresponding to one-half of the surface carbon reactive toward hydrogen; linear and branched alkanes are produced from the other half of the reactive carbonaceous species. On EUROPt-1, mainly ethane and n-pentane are produced during the first minutes of reaction, while on a sintered catalyst the initial production in n-pentane is negligible. The release of n-pentane during an intermediate purge with inert gas on EUROPt-1 shows that C-C bonds can form already during methane adsorption, leading to C{sub 5} precursors on specific active sites of this catalyst. A model of formation of C{sub 5} precursors is proposed by analogy with the organometallic chemistry of molecular hydrocarbon platinacycles. The subsequent production of alkanes (C{sub 2} > C{sub 3} > C{sub 4} > C{sub 5}) could be described through a statistical model of dynamic coupling between carbonaceous species involving hydrogen, rather than by hydrogenolysis of heavier carbonaceous species. However, this latter mechanism is likely to predominate for the production of C{sub 6}-C{sub 8} compounds.","","","","","","United States","1999-04-25T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: Journal of Catalysis; Journal Volume: 183; Journal Issue: 2; Other Information: PBD: 25 Apr 1999","","Medium: X; Size: pp. 384-395","","","","Journal ID: JCTLA5; ISSN 0021-9517; TRN: IM9926%%74","10.1006/jcat.1999.2400","","2009-12-16T00:00:00Z","350265","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/350265","","Journal of Catalysis","2","183"

Methods of physicochemical characterization such as X-ray absorption spectroscopy and hydrogen chemisorption suggest that carbon formation (most likely from methane) rather than sintering is the main cause of catalyst deactivation. The rate of carbon formation decreased in the order Pt/{gamma}-Al{sub 2}O{sub 3} {much_gt} Pt/TiO{sub 2} > Pt/ZrO{sub 2}. Carbon was formed on the support and on Pt. Using the stability of that carbon toward oxidation it was estimated for Pt/{gamma}-Al{sub 2}O{sub 3} that 90% of the carbon was located on the oxidic support. However, even for this catalyst the amount of carbon formed is sufficient to cover only 30% of the total specific surface area of the catalyst. Although carbon can be formed on the metal and the support, evidence is presented that deactivation is caused by carbon formed on the metal and is associated with overgrowth of the catalytically active perimeter between the support and the metal. The reason for the deactivation is the imbalance between the carbon-forming methane dissociation and the oxidation by chemisorbed CO{sub 2}. Active carbidic carbon seems to be transformed to a less reactive form. Catalysts having larger Pt particles (>1 nm) tend to deactivate more quickly than catalysts with smaller Pt particles.","","","","","","United States","1999-04-25T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: Journal of Catalysis; Journal Volume: 183; Journal Issue: 2; Other Information: PBD: 25 Apr 1999","","Medium: X; Size: pp. 336-343","","","","Journal ID: JCTLA5; ISSN 0021-9517; TRN: IM9926%%70","10.1006/jcat.1999.2402","","2009-12-16T00:00:00Z","350261","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/350261","","Journal of Catalysis","2","183"

The model includes both homogeneous and heterogeneous reactions. Focusing on the use of detailed reaction networks, previously validated experimentally, and the critical role of oxygen in both methane activation and product degradation, this work systematically explores the use of controlled oxygen addition and product removal schemes that improve OCM performance. Based on a plug flow reactor that is divided into N{sub p} stages, within which oxygen is added and/or products are removed, a rigorous optimization algorithm is developed that simultaneously maximizes C{sub 2} yields and minimizes O{sub 2} consumption. In the absence of catalyst and product removal, the C{sub 2} yield is maximized at a fixed O{sub 2}/CH{sub 4} ratio, but this maximum yield is independent of the form in which the oxygen is added (cofeed or staged). When a catalyst is added, the optimal C{sub 2} yields show only gradual improvements with oxygen distribution because the benefits of the lower oxygen reaction order on the catalyst are adversely affected by concomitant surface degradation reactions. The largest yield improvements are obtained when the C{sub 2} hydrocarbons are removed at each stage before they undergo oxidation reactions. Thus, when staged oxygen addition is combined with product removal in the presence of a catalyst, C{sub 2} yields as high as 87% are achieved in about 20 stages. Such yield values are consistent with experiments in which continuous product separation schemes have been used.","","","","","","United States","1999-04-01T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: AIChE Journal; Journal Volume: 45; Journal Issue: 4; Other Information: PBD: Apr 1999","","Medium: X; Size: pp. 860-868","","","","Journal ID: AICEAC; ISSN 0001-1541; TRN: IM9922%%241","10.1002/aic.690450417","","2009-12-16T00:00:00Z","345308","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/345308","","AIChE Journal","4","45"

In this process, high selectivity (33 wt %) toward the total C{sub 4} hydrocarbons was achieved when the second reactor was operated at 423 K, with a catalyst ratio of 1:1:5 and at a WHSV of 15 h{sup {minus}1}. This selectivity is much higher compared to a maximum selectivity of 14 wt % obtained using a single reactor with a Co-Ni/ZrO{sub 2} catalyst. Catalyst characterization using temperature-programmed desorption of NH{sub 3} and {sup 1}H MAS NMR showed that this high selectivity toward total C{sub 4} hydrocarbons was due to the strong acidity of the SO{sub 4}{sup 2{minus}}/ZrO{sub 2} catalyst. However, this catalyst deactivated rapidly which was due to coke deposition on the SO{sub 4}{sup 2{minus}} catalyst. However, this catalyst deactivated rapidly which was due to coke deposition on the SO{sub 4}{sup 2{minus}}/ZrO{sub 2} catalyst. Under these experimental conditions, external and intraparticle mass transfer effects were found to be negligible. On the basis of the product distribution in a dual-reaction system, a reaction pathway has been proposed.","","","","","","United States","1999-04-01T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: Industrial and Engineering Chemistry Research; Journal Volume: 38; Journal Issue: 4; Other Information: PBD: Apr 1999","","Medium: X; Size: pp. 1323-1334","","","","Journal ID: IECRED; ISSN 0888-5885; TRN: IM9922%%272","10.1021/ie9804881","","2009-12-16T00:00:00Z","345339","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/345339","","Industrial and Engineering Chemistry Research","4","38"

The process was found to involve the Meerwein-Ponndorf-Verley reaction, aldol condensations, dehydrations, and hydrogenations. The presence of basic sites is indispensable for the reaction to develop; however, acid sites also play an active role. The selectivity for each reaction product depends on the particular catalyst used. The total conversion is maximal with the catalysts containing the largest populations of acid and basic sites. Also, catalysts with large numbers of acid sites exhibit an increased selectivity towards the corresponding alkenes. The use of dimethyl carbonate instead of methanol alters the reaction selectivity to an extent dependent on the particular catalyst and operating conditions. However, this also results in markedly decreased total conversion in some instances.","","","","","","United States","1999-04-01T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: Journal of Catalysis; Journal Volume: 183; Journal Issue: 1; Other Information: PBD: 1 Apr 1999","","Medium: X; Size: pp. 119-127","","","","Journal ID: JCTLA5; ISSN 0021-9517; TRN: IM9926%%61","10.1006/jcat.1998.2360","","2009-12-16T00:00:00Z","350252","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/350252","","Journal of Catalysis","1","183"

One configuration of particular interest is the multivessel column, which can be viewed as a generalization of all previously studied batch column configurations. A detailed dynamic model was used for comparing various optimal operating policies for a batch distillation column with two intermediate vessels. A wide variety of degrees of freedom including reflux ratios, product withdrawal rates, heat input to the reboiler, and initial feed distribution were considered. A mixture consisting of methanol, ethanol, n-propanol and n-butanol was studied using an objective function relating to the economics of the column operation. Optimizing the initial distribution of the feed among the vessels improved column performance significantly. For some separations, withdrawing product from the vessels into accumulators was better than total reflux operation in terms of energy consumption. Open-loop optimal operation was also compared to a recently proposed feedback control strategy where the controller parameters are optimized. The energy consumption of a regular column was about twice that of a multivessel column having the same number of stages.","","","","","","United States","1999-04-01T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: AIChE Journal; Journal Volume: 45; Journal Issue: 4; Other Information: PBD: Apr 1999","","Medium: X; Size: pp. 781-801","","","","Journal ID: AICEAC; ISSN 0001-1541; TRN: IM9922%%239","10.1002/aic.690450413","","2009-12-16T00:00:00Z","345306","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/345306","","AIChE Journal","4","45"

Experimental conditions were varied as follows: reactor pressure of 0.8--3.2 MPa, H{sub 2}/CO feed ratio = 0.5--2.0, and a space velocity of 0.5--2.0 {times} 10{sup {minus}3} Nm{sup 3}/kg{sub cat} s at a constant temperature of 523 K. A new product distribution model for linear hydrocarbons is proposed. Deviations from conventional Anderson-Schulz-Flory distribution can be quantitatively described with an {alpha}-olefin readsorption product distribution model. The experimentally observed relatively high yield of methane, relatively low yield of ethene, and both the exponential decrease of the olefin-to-paraffin ratio and the change of the chain growth parameter with chain length can all be predicted from this new model. It combines a mechanistic model of olefin readsorption with kinetics of chain growth and termination on the same catalytic sites. The hydrocarbon formation is based on the surface carbide mechanism by CH{sub 2} insertion. The olefin readsorption rate depends on the chain length because of increasing physisorption strength on the catalyst surface and increasing solubility in FT wax with increasing chain length. Interfacial concentrations of reactive olefins near the gas-wax and wax-catalyst surface are used in the kinetic model. With optimization of three parameters per experimental product distribution, the olefin readsorption product distribution model proved to predict product selectivities accurately over the entire range of experimental conditions. The relative deviations are 10.1% and 9.1% for the selectivity to paraffins and olefins with n < 11, respectively.","","","","USDOE","","United States","1999-04-01T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: Industrial and Engineering Chemistry Research; Journal Volume: 38; Journal Issue: 4; Other Information: PBD: Apr 1999","","Medium: X; Size: pp. 1277-1290","","","","Journal ID: IECRED; ISSN 0888-5885; TRN: IM9922%%268","10.1021/ie980561n","","2016-05-16T00:00:00Z","345335","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/345335","","Industrial and Engineering Chemistry Research","4","38"

The hydrostatic pressure head method and the dynamic gas disengagement technique were employed to obtain the gas holdup profile and the values corresponding to different gas bubble sizes in the reactor. The experimental data showed that the gas holdup consists mainly of two classes of gas bubbles, small and large. The gas holdup data for the gases used were found to increase with pressure and superficial gas velocity due to the increase of the volume fraction of the small and large gas bubbles, respectively. The increase of catalyst loading, however, appeared to decrease the gas holdup values, due to the decrease of the volume fraction of the small gas bubbles.

The reaction-induced spreading kinetics were accelerated by reaction of gaseous components with metal oxides to form mobile complex compounds and found to depend on temperature, gaseous component, metal oxide, and oxide support. Increasing the reaction temperature increases the metal oxide spreading rate. The efficiencies of converting three-dimensional bulk metal oxides into two-dimensional surface metal oxide species by different gaseous components are methanol {much_gt} ethanol > 2-butanol, water {much_gt} oxygen. The high reaction-induced spreading efficiency of methanol is related to the high volatility and stability of its metal-methoxy complexes. Reaction-induced spreading of CrO{sub 3}, MoO{sub 3}, V{sub 2}O{sub 5}, Re{sub 2}O{sub 7}, and Cr{sub 2}O{sub 3} during alcohol oxidation readily occurs on TiO{sub 2} and SnO{sub 2} supports but does not take place on SiO{sub 2} because of the low interaction energy between SiO{sub 2} and surface metal oxide species. Furthermore, reaction-induced spreading does not appear to be influenced by the oxidation state of the spreading metal oxides. The mechanism of reaction-induced spreading proceeds iva the reaction of an alcohol with metal cations to form surface mobile and volatile metal-alkoxy complexes and their subsequent transport through surface diffusion and volatilization/readsorption. The reaction-induced spreading of metal oxides is directly reflected in the catalytic properties of such mixed metal oxide materials since the surface metal oxide species are significantly more active than bulk metal oxides for alcohol oxidation reactions. These new findings have important fundamental implications for synergetic effects of metal oxide catalysts composed of physical mixtures and for commercial applications.","","","","USDOE, Washington, DC (United States)","","United States","1999-02-16T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: Langmuir; Journal Volume: 15; Journal Issue: 4; Other Information: PBD: 16 Feb 1999","","Medium: X; Size: pp. 1223-1235","","","FG02-95ER14550","Journal ID: LANGD5; ISSN 0743-7463; TRN: IM9914%%29","10.1021/la9807210","","2009-12-16T00:00:00Z","328222","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/328222","","Langmuir","4","15"

These routes aim at incorporating Lewis base groups into good film-forming polymers with different structures. The Lewis base groups showed a high affinity to alcohols in screening tests, thus imparting high pervaporation selectivity to the polymer materials. They led to several membranes able to extract pure ethanol out of the azeotropic mixture, but with very low permeation rates. Further modifications of the polymer structure allowed the authors to synthesize materials with greatly enhanced transfer rates and with acceptable selectivity for industrial applications. Structure-property relationships were derived from sorption and pervaporation data for a qualitative prediction of the effect of polymer structure on the flux and selectivity. For these solvent-polymer systems the diffusion phenomenon appears to further improve the pervaporation selectivity for alcohol compared with that given by the sorption process at the membrane face.","","","","","","United States","1999-02-01T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: Separation Science and Technology; Journal Volume: 34; Journal Issue: 3; Other Information: PBD: Feb 1999","","Medium: X; Size: pp. 369-390","","","","Journal ID: SSTEDS; ISSN 0149-6395; TRN: IM9912%%319","10.1081/SS-100100656","","2009-12-16T00:00:00Z","324001","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/324001","","Separation Science and Technology","3","34"

Significant results were obtained when silica-alumina and HZSM-5 were used in a weight ratio of 9:1 as upper and lower catalysts, respectively, in a flow reactor. The reverse sequence of catalysts showed no advantage. It was suggested that large pores and moderate acidity of the silica-alumina loaded in the upper layer operated favorably to catalyze the degradation of polyethylene into liquid hydrocarbons.

For the clean Cu(100) surface it is found that admission of CO to a reaction mixture containing CO{sub 2} and H{sub 2} does not lead to an increase in the rate of methanol formation, which indirectly suggests that the role of CO in the industrial methanol process relates to the change in reduction potential of the synthesis gas.

In opposition, admission of CO to the reaction mixture leads to a significant increase in the rate of methanol formation with a turnover frequency/Ni site {approximately}60 {times} the turnover frequency/Cu site at Ni coverages below 0.1 ML making it a rather substantial promoting effect.

The aim of this work is to investigate the effect of SnO{sub 2} addition to Li/MgO catalysts by using several characterization methods such as XPS, IR, and XRD. Activity measurements were carried out at 923 K, where the C{sub 2} yield over Li/MgO catalyst was rather low.

The quartz phase of FePO{sub 4}, as well as silica supported FePO{sub 4} prepared by impregnation (5 wt%), were examined in a continuous flow reactor. Experiments carried out over FePO{sub 4} show high selectivity to formaldehyde at low conversion and suggest that formaldehyde is the primary reaction product, but selectivity decreased rapidly as conversion was increased. The highest space-time yield of formaldehyde observed for this catalyst was 59 g/kg{sub cat}-h. Above 5% methane conversion, carbon oxides were the only products. For silica-supported FePO{sub 4}, formaldehyde selectivity did not fall off rapidly, exhibiting a formaldehyde selectivity of 12% at about 10% conversion (STY = 285 g/kg{sub cat}-h). Quantifiable yields of methanol were observed at very low conversion levels, i.e., below 3% (STY = 11 g/kg{sub cat}-h). Addition of steam (up to 0.1 atm partial pressure) into the feed stream increased the selectivity to methanol ({approximately}25 g/kg cat/h with up to 3% selectivity) and formaldehyde ({approximately}487 g/kg cat/h with up to 94% selectivity) for the silica-supported FePO{sub 4} catalyst. Steam addition had little effect on catalyst activity. Characterization results indicate the presence of FePO{sub 4}, as well as fivefold coordinate Fe{sup 3+} in silica supported catalyst samples, and this species is proposed to be responsible for methane activation. After catalysis in the presence of steam, the fivefold coordinate iron is present, but a significant fraction of the FePO{sub 4} has been reduced to Fe{sub 2}P{sub 2}O{sub 7}. Enhanced selectivity in the presence of steam is attributed in part to the ease of the reversible formation of surface hydroxyl groups (P-OH) from pyrophosphate (P-O-P) groups.","","","","USDOE, Washington, DC (United States)","","United States","1999-01-01T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: Journal of Catalysis; Journal Volume: 181; Journal Issue: 1; Other Information: PBD: 1 Jan 1999","","Medium: X; Size: pp. 104-112","","","AC22-92PC92110","Journal ID: JCTLA5; ISSN 0021-9517; TRN: IM9908%%398","10.1006/jcat.1998.2297","","2009-12-16T00:00:00Z","316317","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/316317","","Journal of Catalysis","1","181"

Lower alcohols produced in the low temperature top bed are supplied as oxygenated precursors to the higher temperature bottom bed to react further in the chain growth process leading to the formation of higher alcohols. In this configuration, a high space time yield of 202 g/kg of catalyst/h of 2-methyl-1-propanol (isobutanol) was obtained. This presently observed yield of isobutanol in a double bed configuration with the copper-based catalyst in both beds represents a very significant enhancement over the earlier reported isobutanol yields in a double bed configuration with a copper-free catalyst in the second bed . A kinetic reaction network was modified to model this double bed catalyst configuration. This model was then used to obtain kinetic parameters and predict product yields for the reaction system in the current study. It was also demonstrated that the kinetic model could be used as a predictive tool to optimize experimental parameters. In particular, the model was used to predict the optimum mass ratio of the two catalyst beds to produce the maximum yield of isobutanol.","","","","USDOE, Washington, DC (United States)","","United States","1998-12-01T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: Industrial and Engineering Chemistry Research; Journal Volume: 37; Journal Issue: 12; Other Information: PBD: Dec 1998","","Medium: X; Size: pp. 4657-4668","","","","Journal ID: IECRED; ISSN 0888-5885; TRN: IM9910%%269","10.1021/ie9705620","","2009-12-16T00:00:00Z","321078","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/321078","","Industrial and Engineering Chemistry Research","12","37"

A wide range of synthesis gas conversions have been obtained by varying space velocities over catalysts with various potassium loadings. Differing trends in catalyst activity with potassium loading were observed depending on the space velocity of synthesis gas conversion. As potassium loading increased, the catalyst activity either decreased (low conversion), passed through a maximum (intermediate conversion), or increased (high conversion). This is shown to be a result of the increasing dependency of the Fischer-Tropsch synthesis on the hydrogen formed by the water-gas shift reaction with increasing synthesis gas conversions. Both the rate constant and the adsorption parameter in a common two-parameter Fischer-Tropsch rate expression decreased with potassium loading; therefore, observed maxima in Fischer-Tropsch rate with potassium loading can be due to the opposing influences of these parameters. The effect of potassium on alkene selectivity was dependent on the number of carbon atoms of the hydrocarbons as well as the carbon monoxide conversion level. The extent of isomerization of 1-alkene product decreased with potassium loading, while the selectivity to methane decreased only slightly with increasing potassium content at CO conversions about 50% and higher.","","","","USDOE, Washington, DC (United States)","","United States","1998-11-15T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: Journal of Catalysis; Journal Volume: 180; Journal Issue: 1; Other Information: DN: Paper presented at the Fischer-Tropsch conversion of gas to liquid symposium, March 10--13, 1997, Houston, TX (US); PBD: 15 Nov 1998","","Medium: X; Size: pp. 36-43","","","AC22-94PC94055","Journal ID: JCTLA5; ISSN 0021-9517; TRN: IM9908%%383","10.1006/jcat.1998.2259","","2009-12-16T00:00:00Z","316302","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/316302","","Journal of Catalysis","1","180"

The activities of the carbides were found to be comparable to those of elemental iridium and ruthenium (well known to be active noble metal catalysts for the reforming of methane), and the conversion and product distribution were in accord with those calculated from the thermodynamic equilibria. At ambient pressure the carbides deactivated, in all the processes, due to the oxidation of the catalyst to MO{sub 2}, while operation at elevated pressure (8 bar) resulted in stabilization of the carbide and no catalyst deactivation for the duration of the experiments (72 h). HRTEM analysis showed that no macroscopic carbon was deposited on the catalysts during the catalyst reactions. The deactivation rate of the carbides reflected the strength of the oxidant used:oxygen > water {approx_equal} carbon dioxide. A deactivation mechanism, via the insertion of O{sup *} resulting in oxide terraces is discussed, and two possible mechanisms for the production of synthesis gas by the methane dry reforming reaction over metal carbides are proposed: noble metal type and redox type.","","","","","","United States","1998-11-15T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: Journal of Catalysis; Journal Volume: 180; Journal Issue: 1; Other Information: PBD: 15 Nov 1998","","Medium: X; Size: pp. 85-100","","","","Journal ID: JCTLA5; ISSN 0021-9517; TRN: IM9908%%384","10.1006/jcat.1998.2260","","2009-12-16T00:00:00Z","316303","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/316303","","Journal of Catalysis","1","180"

"Reduced variational space analysis of methane adducts","Cundari, T R; Klinckman, T R","03 NATURAL GAS; 10 SYNTHETIC FUELS; METHANE; METHANOL; SYNTHESIS; CHEMICAL ACTIVATION; CHEMICAL BONDS; REACTION INTERMEDIATES","Methane is the major component of natural gas, and hence its catalytic conversion to functionalized products (e.g., methanol) is of great interest. A variety of transition metal complexes have been investigated experimentally for the selective activation of methane. Recent experiments and computations suggest that weakly bound methane adducts play a pivotal role in metal-mediated methane activation. Calculation of the intrinsic reaction coordinates for methane activation by d{sup 0} imidos indicates that the adduct lies along the pathway for methane activation. Isolation of a stable methane adduct, suitable for experimental characterization, would be aided by a greater understanding of their chemistry. Given the short-lived nature of these adducts and the limited direct experimental information, computational chemistry is a useful tool for understanding the bonding and structure of these catalytic intermediates. This research investigated the bonding forces in methane adducts of transition metal (TM) complexes. The calculations reported here employed effective core potential (ECP) methods within the Hartree-Fock approximation using the GAMESS quantum chemistry program. The reduced variational space self-consistent field (RVS-SCF) method developed by Stevens and Fink was employed. This technique was used to analyze the Coulomb and exchange energy (CEX), polarization energy (POL), and charge transfer energy (CT) contributions to the binding energy ({Delta}E{sub add}) of methane to a TM complex. Adducts of high-valent (d{sup 0}) transition metal complexes were studied. The role of metal, ligand, and charge on the different contributions to the binding energy were analyzed.","","","","USDOE, Washington, DC (United States)","","United States","1998-10-05T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: Inorganic Chemistry; Journal Volume: 37; Journal Issue: 20; Other Information: PBD: 5 Oct 1998","","Medium: X; Size: pp. 5399-5401","","","FG02-97ER14811","Journal ID: INOCAJ; ISSN 0020-1669; TRN: IM9910%%303","10.1021/ic980639s","","2009-12-16T00:00:00Z","321111","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/321111","","Inorganic Chemistry","20","37"
"Dehydrogenative coupling of methane catalyzed by platinum-added sulfated zirconia and characterization of the catalyst surface","Kurosaka, Tadahiro; Matuhashi, Hiromi; Arata, Kazushi","03 NATURAL GAS; 10 SYNTHETIC FUELS; METHANE; REFORMER PROCESSES; DEHYDROGENATION; PLATINUM; CATALYTIC EFFECTS; ZIRCONIUM OXIDES; CATALYSTS; CHEMICAL PREPARATION; DEACTIVATION","An active and stable catalyst of 3 wt% Pt-added sulfated-zirconia for the dehydrogenative coupling of methane without oxidant was obtained by sulfating zirconia gel with 0.5 M H{sub 2}SO{sub 4}, followed by drying, impregnating the sulfated gel with a solution of H{sub 2}PtCl{sub 6}, calcining in air at 600 C, and finally reducing in H{sub 2} at 500 C. The catalyst gave conversion of 0.23%, ca 40% of the equilibrium value, at 500 C and was steady during the run of 5 h in a flow reactor (0.5 g catalyst, 10 ml/min methane). The products were ethane and ethylene in a ratio of 9:1; CO{sub 2} was negligible. A remarkable loss of activity was observed with the catalysts sulfated with ammonium sulfate instead of sulfuric acid. XRD analysis showed that the sulfation of zirconia gel with sulfuric acid led to high dispersion of the Pt matter onto the support; the observations were confirmed by the amount of CO chemisorbed on the surface Pt atom. The adsorption measurement of CO showed the ratio of CO/Pt to be 0.09. Using TG-DTA the sulfur quantity on the catalyst was estimated from a weight loss at 600--1000 C, caused by decomposition of the sulfate species, and the ratio of Pt to S was determined to be 1. XPS showed SO{sub 4}{sup 2{minus}} for the S state and 10% of the platinate to be in the metallic state. Measurements of TG-DTA and XPS, in addition to the CO chemisorption, showed an active site (in the steady state) to be Pt{sup 0}-SO{sub 4}/ZrO{sub 2} surrounded by 10 times platinate-SO{sub 4}/ZrO{sub 2} with various oxidation numbers of Pt except 0, whose species protect the active one from aggregation. The turnover frequencies were estimated to be 0.18 min{sup {minus}1}.","","","","","","United States","1998-10-01T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: Journal of Catalysis; Journal Volume: 179; Journal Issue: 1; Other Information: PBD: 1 Oct 1998","","Medium: X; Size: pp. 28-35","","","","Journal ID: JCTLA5; ISSN 0021-9517; TRN: IM9832%%39","10.1006/jcat.1998.2209","","2009-12-16T00:00:00Z","672458","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/672458","","Journal of Catalysis","1","179"

The authors consider the effect of the following parameters on selectivities and conversions: adding a washcoat, varying pore size, ceramic support material, and loading of noble metal. In oxidation of methane on rhodium-coated monoliths, maximum hydrogen selectivity improves from 89 to 95% on the addition of a washcoat. It is also a strong function of the catalyst pore size, changing from 83% on a catalyst with 20 ppi (pores per inch) to 93% on a catalyst with 80 ppi. It varies from 86 to 91% on adding a washcoat and changes from 70 to 95% on changing the pore size. In the oxidation of ethane on platinum-coated monoliths, the addition of a washcoat reduces ethylene selectivity from 63 to 35%, while changing the pore size results in minor variations. On different ceramic supports, the ethylene selectivity varies from 60 to 64% with mullite giving the best results. The authors find that washcoat addition, decreasing pore size, and replacement of zirconia for alumina as the support material increase syngas selectivity and reduce olefin selectivity irrespective of the fuel, catalyst, or amount of diluent used. Most of these results can be explained on the basis of differences in mass transfer rates to the catalytic site between catalysts of different support geometries. It is argued that homogeneous reactions play a minor role in these short contact time processes.","","","","National Science Foundation, Washington, DC (United States)","","United States","1998-10-01T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: Journal of Catalysis; Journal Volume: 179; Journal Issue: 1; Other Information: PBD: 1 Oct 1998","","Medium: X; Size: pp. 138-149","","","","Journal ID: JCTLA5; ISSN 0021-9517; TRN: IM9832%%45","10.1006/jcat.1998.2224","","2009-12-16T00:00:00Z","672464","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/672464","","Journal of Catalysis","1","179"

Similarly, the SiO{sub 2{minus}} and MgO-based catalysts are less active in the formation of CH{sub 3{minus}} radicals that emanate into the gas phase and in the secondary reaction of these radicals with the catalysts. During the OCM reaction, ethane is the primary product; ethylene is produced only in small amounts at short contact times. As a secondary product, however, ethylene competes with methane in the formation of carbon dioxide. The conversion of C{sub 2}H{sub 4} to CO{sub 2} at 800 C is largely a result of a heterogeneous reaction, due to the inhibiting effect of CH{sub 4} on the gas phase oxidation reaction. Pulse experiments demonstrated that the presence of gas phase O{sub 2} is essential for obtaining an active catalyst. Presumably, an endothermic equilibrium reaction involving O{sub 2} results in a form of surface oxygen that is capable of abstracting a hydrogen from CH{sub 4}. The unusually large activation energy of ca. 63 kcal/mol for both catalysts may result, in part, from this oxygen equilibrium.","","","","","","United States","1998-10-01T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: Journal of Catalysis; Journal Volume: 179; Journal Issue: 1; Other Information: PBD: 1 Oct 1998","","Medium: X; Size: pp. 222-230","","","","Journal ID: JCTLA5; ISSN 0021-9517; TRN: IM9832%%50","10.1006/jcat.1998.2228","","2009-12-16T00:00:00Z","672469","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/672469","","Journal of Catalysis","1","179"

Each of these catalysts were tested at four different reactor operating conditions (T of 400 or 440 C and P of 1000 or 1500 psig) for higher alcohol synthesis (HAS) using a syngas feedstream (1:1 CO:H{sub 2}) after reductive pretreatment. High isobutanol production rates in conjunction with low methanol-to-isobutanol mole ratios ({le}1.0) and low hydrocarbon byproduct rates are desired. For the K-promoted catalysts the highest isobutanol production rates are obtained at the higher pressure and temperature settings of 1500 psig and 440 C, and methanol-to-isobutanol mole ratios below the ideal value of 1.0, which is required for downstream methyl tertiary-butyl ether (MTBE) synthesis, are obtained. The Cs-promoted catalysts generally yield higher isobutanol production rates than the K-promoted catalysts. The highest isobutanol production rate of 170 g/kg-h is obtained using the 3 wt% Cs-promoted catalyst at 1000 psig and 440 C. The lower pressure is economically advantageous with regard to process costs. Most importantly, this isobutanol production rate is quite high compared to others presented in the literature and demonstrates that Pd does enhance the synthesis of isobutanol. The catalytic activity remained stable over a 5-day test period for each catalyst. X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) and ion scattering spectroscopy (ISS) were used to characterize these catalysts. The results obtained from these techniques indicate that pretreating the catalysts in 1 {times} 10{sup {minus}7} Torr of H{sub 2} at 300 C for 4 h causes an enrichment of the near-surface alkali-promotor concentration.","","","","National Science Foundation, Washington, DC (United States); USDOE, Washington, DC (United States)","","United States","1998-10-01T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: Journal of Catalysis; Journal Volume: 179; Journal Issue: 1; Other Information: PBD: 1 Oct 1998","","Medium: X; Size: pp. 241-257","","","AC22-91PC90046","Journal ID: JCTLA5; ISSN 0021-9517; TRN: IM9832%%51","10.1006/jcat.1998.2194","","2009-12-16T00:00:00Z","672470","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/672470","","Journal of Catalysis","1","179"

Kinetic results indicate that the reaction over the Ni/La{sub 2}O{sub 3} catalyst follows mainly the sequence of total oxidation to CO{sub 2} and H{sub 2}O, followed by reforming reactions to synthesis gas, while CO formation via the direct route is observed at very low oxygen partial pressures. Chemisorption and FTIR studies show that the enhanced stability of the Ni/La{sub 2}O{sub 3} catalyst is related to decoration of the Ni crystallites with lanthanum species, primarily oxycarbonates, which favor removal of excess carbon deposition and impart the catalyst its stability characteristics.","","","","","","United States","1998-10-01T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: Journal of Catalysis; Journal Volume: 179; Journal Issue: 1; Other Information: PBD: 1 Oct 1998","","Medium: X; Size: pp. 283-291","","","","Journal ID: JCTLA5; ISSN 0021-9517; TRN: IM9832%%52","10.1006/jcat.1998.2182","","2009-12-16T00:00:00Z","672471","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/672471","","Journal of Catalysis","1","179"

In this paper, the production of acetylene via plasma catalytic conversion of methane over NaY zeolite is discussed. Hydrogen is produced as a by-product during this plasma catalytic methane conversion. A methane/hydrogen feed with oxygen as an additive and helium as a diluent has been studied in this investigation. The CH{sub 4}/H{sub 2}/O{sub 2} system is found to be more selective for the production of C{sub 2} hydrocarbons, compared to the CH{sub 4}/O{sub 2}, CH{sub 4}H{sub 2}O, and CH{sub 4}/CO{sub 2} systems reported previously. A higher hydrogen concentration feed is more favorable for acetylene formation. The selectivity and yield of C{sub 2} hydrocarbons are related to the hydrogen feed rate, gas temperature, concentration of oxygen additive, and flowrate. The highest yield of C{sub 2} hydrocarbons (32%) is obtained at the lowest flowrate used (10 cm{sup 3}/s; residence time {approximately}2.3 s).

The effects of the catalyst preparation parameters (Mo precursor, Mo loading, doping levels of K and Co, and calcination) and of the reaction conditions (temperature and space velocity) were studied. The screening procedure consisted of ramping the temperature steadily from 200 to 400 C and back again. Adding K results in a maximum in the space-time yield (STY) of total alcohols and the ratio of higher alcohols to methanol. Increasing the reaction temperature results in a monotonic increase in the STY of hydrocarbons, a monotonic decrease in the selectivity toward alcohols, and a maximum in the STY of alcohols. Increasing the space velocity increases the STY and selectivity to alcohols while decreasing the STY of hydrocarbons.

A dielectric barrier discharge reactor generates a nonequilibrium plasma when a sufficiently high voltage is applied across the reactor`s electrodes. Methane molecules are activated at this temperature and coupled to form C{sub 2} hydrocarbons, higher hydrocarbons, and hydrogen. The study on the effect of voltage, residence time and third bodies on methane conversion and product selectivity shows that methane conversion initially increases with increasing voltage and residence time above the breakdown voltage, and product selectivities are essentially independent of the voltage. Production of hydrogen during the reaction limits olefin production. Methane conversion also increases when helium and ethane are in the feed stream. Helium and ethane both appear to be more easily activated than methane and enhance methane activation and conversion.","","","","USDOE, Washington, DC (United States)","","United States","1998-10-01T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: AIChE Journal; Journal Volume: 44; Journal Issue: 10; Other Information: PBD: Oct 1998","","Medium: X; Size: pp. 2252-2257","","","FG21-94MC31170","Journal ID: AICEAC; ISSN 0001-1541; TRN: IM9831%%261","10.1002/aic.690441014","","2009-12-16T00:00:00Z","669999","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/669999","","AIChE Journal","10","44"

H abstraction by OH radicals is expected to become effective in competing with the previously proposed four-center methanol elimination initiation pathway above 973 K. This is based on the nine equivalent C-H abstraction sites on the t-butyl group coupled with OH being nonselective towards the abstraction sites at these temperatures. In addition to the formation of isobutene and methanol as primary organic byproducts, gas chromatographic-mass spectrometric analysis indicated the facile formation of benzene and other aromatic compounds at 1273 K.

Oxygen defects facilitate the oxygen incorporation into the lattice of SrO(1 at%)Nd{sub 2}O{sub 3} as indicated by the lower CPD changes due to oxygen adsorption and the higher extent of oxygen exchange for SrO-doped Nd{sub 2}O{sub 3} compared with pure Nd{sub 2}O{sub 3}.

The effect of composition on structure and surface and catalytic properties was studied by combining several characterization methods with ethanol conversion reactions. The nature, density, and strength of surface basic sites depended on the Al content. The catalyst activity and selectivity of Mg-Al mixed oxides in ethanol conversion reactions depended on composition. The dehydrogenation of ethanol to acetaldehyde and the aldol condensation to n-butanol both involved the initial surface ethoxide formation on a Lewis acid-strong base pair. The dehydration of ethanol to ethylene, and the coupling and dehydration to diethyl ether increased with Al content, probably reflecting the density increase of both Al{sup 3+}-O{sup 2{minus}} pairs and low- and medium-strength basic sites.

Cu on very pure silica produces hardly any methanol, while the addition of basic oxides and the use of {gamma}-alumina as support improve the catalyst performance. The strong promoting effect of Ca and La oxide on the silica-supported Cu and the weak promoting effect for alumina-supported Cu suggest that the basic oxide additives must be close to or in contact with the Cu particles to be effective in methanol synthesis.

Temperature-programmed reduction of these catalysts and NiO-MgO with different Ni/Mg ratios by H{sub 2} from 100 C to 900 C has also been thoroughly investigated. The NiO-CaO, NiO-MgO-CaO, and NiO-MgO catalysts show increasingly superior performance in the oxidative conversion of methane to CO and H{sub 2} at a very low contact time (1 ms). However, the presence of higher alkaline earth oxide (SrO and/or BaO) causes a large decrease or almost complete deactivation of the NiO-containing alkaline earth oxide(s) catalyst for the reaction.

However, the separation of the reactor catalyst from the wax product is an issue that has yet to be satisfactorily resolved. Vapor and liquid equilibrium compositions have been measured for the hexane + hexadecane and the hexane + 1-hexadecanol systems at temperatures from 472.0 K to 623.0 K and pressures from 6.2 bar to 46.4 bar. A continuous-flow apparatus was used both to minimize possible thermal degradation and to accurately measure the lower hexadecanol concentrations in the vapor phase.

The results of XRD, XPS, and TG-MS show the presence of incompletely decomposed nickel nitrates and NiO for catalysts calcined at 225--250 C, and the presence of NiO for catalysts calcined at 300--500 C. NiTiO{sub 3} becomes the dominant nickel species in the catalyst calcined at 600 C. Reducibility of nickel to nickel metal depends on the chemical states of nickel in the calcined catalysts. For catalysts calcined below 600 C, where NiO is the main nickel species, 100% reducibility can be obtained at a reduction temperature of 400 C. However, for catalysts calcined at 600 C, where NiTiO{sub 3} is the dominant nickel species, complete reduction of nickel species can be achieved at 600 C. Lower turnover frequencies (TOF(H{sub 2})) for CO hydrogenation were observed for the catalysts with unreduced nickel phase. When nickel is completely reduced, TOF(H{sub 2}) is independent of the chemical states of nickel in the calcined catalysts or reduction temperature. The TOF(H{sub 2})`s are an order of magnitude higher than that reported for unsupported nickel indicating the promotion effect of titania on CO hydrogenation even after high reduction temperature. However, an increase in ethene formation rate, methane and C2-C4 percentages, and the olefin to paraffin ratio (C2-C4) was observed, along with a significant decrease in the H/O adsorption ratio as reduction temperature was increased to 600 C for all catalysts. This suggests further interaction of TiO{sub x} moieties with nickel surface in addition to blocking.","","","","","","United States","1998-08-15T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: Journal of Catalysis; Journal Volume: 178; Journal Issue: 1; Other Information: PBD: 15 Aug 1998","","Medium: X; Size: pp. 34-48","","","","Journal ID: JCTLA5; ISSN 0021-9517; TRN: IM9829%%102","10.1006/jcat.1998.2102","","2009-12-16T00:00:00Z","659070","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/659070","","Journal of Catalysis","1","178"

Cu also significantly promotes the reductive elimination of methoxide species as methanol. Thus, methanol synthesis over Cu/ZrO{sub 2}/SiO{sub 2} is envisioned to occur on ZrO{sub 2}, with the primary role of Cu being the dissociative adsorption of H{sub 2}. The spillover of atomic H onto ZrO{sub 2} provides the source of hydrogen needed to hydrogenate the carbon-containing species. Spillover of absorbed CO from Cu to zirconia facilitates formate formation on zirconia at lower temperatures than in the absence of Cu. The reductive elimination of methoxide species appears to be the slow step in methanol formation by CO hydrogenation. The lower rate of methanol synthesis over Cu/ZrO{sub 2}/SiO{sub 2} from CO as compared to CO{sub 2} hydrogenation is attributed to the lack of water formation in the former reaction, preventing facile release of methoxide by hydrolysis. The enhanced rate of methanol synthesis from CO over Cu/ZrO{sub 2}/SiO{sub 2} as compared to Cu/SiO{sub 2} is attributed to the lower energy-barrier (formate) pathway available on Cu/ZrO{sub 2}/SiO{sub 2}.","","","","USDOE, Washington, DC (United States)","","United States","1998-08-15T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: Journal of Catalysis; Journal Volume: 178; Journal Issue: 1; Other Information: PBD: 15 Aug 1998","","Medium: X; Size: pp. 153-173","","","AC03-76SF00098","Journal ID: JCTLA5; ISSN 0021-9517; TRN: IM9829%%109","10.1006/jcat.1998.2134","","2009-12-16T00:00:00Z","659077","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/659077","","Journal of Catalysis","1","178"

The structural and textural characteristics of the supports and catalysts are systematically examined by N{sub 2} adsorption/desorption and X-ray diffraction (XRD) techniques. It is found that the pore structures and surface properties of supports greatly affect the catalytic activities of the catalysts prepared. The catalysts supported on the mesoporous clays or pillared clays are obviously superior to those on microporous supports because the mesoporous supports are highly thermal stable compared to the microporous ones. It is found that introducing lanthanum to the supports can improve the catalyst basicity and thus enhance the catalytic activities of these catalysts.

For fixed feed rates of syngas (H{sub 2}/CO = 0.5; 50 std. cm{sup 3}/g catalyst) and n-hexane (1 mL/min), syngas conversion attains a steady state at all pressures, increasing roughly threefold in this pressure range. Effective rate constants, estimated assuming a first-order dependence of syngas conversion on hydrogen, reveal that the catalyst effectiveness increases with pressure implying the alleviation of pore-diffusion limitations. Pore accessibilities increase at higher pressures because the extraction of heavier hydrocarbons from the catalyst pores is enhanced by the liquid-like densities, yet better-than-liquid transport properties, of n-hexane. This explanation is consistent with the single {alpha} (= 0.78) Anderson-Schulz-Flory product distribution, the constant chain termination probability, and the higher primary product (1-olefin) selectivities ({approximately}80%) observed at the higher pressures. Results indicate that the pressure tunability of the density and transport properties of near-critical reaction media offers a powerful tool to optimize catalyst activity and product selectivity during FT reactions on supported catalysts.","","","","USDOE, Washington, DC (United States)","","United States","1998-08-01T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: AIChE Journal; Journal Volume: 44; Journal Issue: 8; Other Information: PBD: Aug 1998","","Medium: X; Size: pp. 1889-1896","","","FG22-92PC92532","Journal ID: AICEAC; ISSN 0001-1541; TRN: IM9828%%176","10.1002/aic.690440818","","2009-12-16T00:00:00Z","655506","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/655506","","AIChE Journal","8","44"

High selectivities to CO{sub x} products at low surface densities and on bulk ZrV{sub 2}O{sub 7} appear to be associated with exposed unselective V-O-Zr and Zr-O-Zr sites. Propane oxidative dehydrogenation rates increase initially as the size of polyvanadate domains increases with increasing VO{sub x} surface density. Oxidative dehydrogenation rates decreases eventually as the formation of V{sub 2}O{sub 5} clusters at high surface densities leads to a decrease in the fraction of VO{sub x} exposed at cluster surfaces. The ratio of rate constants for propane oxidative dehydrogenation and propene combustion to CO{sub x} remains constant throughout the entire range of VO{sub x} surface density (0.4--100 VO{sub x}/nm{sup 2}), suggesting that primary oxidative dehydrogenation steps and secondary oxidation reactions of desired propene products require identical polyvanadate structures.","","","","USDOE, Washington, DC (United States)","","United States","1998-07-25T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: Journal of Catalysis; Journal Volume: 177; Journal Issue: 2; Other Information: PBD: 25 Jul 1998","","Medium: X; Size: pp. 343-351","","","AC03-76SF00098","Journal ID: JCTLA5; ISSN 0021-9517; TRN: IM9827%%218","10.1006/jcat.1998.2143","","2009-12-16T00:00:00Z","653324","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/653324","","Journal of Catalysis","2","177"

The authors find a clear correlation between catalyst performance and support structure in the final calcined material. Amorphous silica yields active but very unselective catalysts. Crystalline SiO{sub 2} ({alpha}-cristobalite) generates active and highly selective catalysts--especially with respect to the formation of ethylene. The authors demonstrate that the presence of Na is essential for the anomalous low temperature silica {r_arrow} cristobalite support phase transition to occur. The structural, catalytic, and spectroscopic results indicate that Na plays a dual role as both structural and chemical promoter.","","","","","","United States","1998-07-25T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: Journal of Catalysis; Journal Volume: 177; Journal Issue: 2; Other Information: PBD: 25 Jul 1998","","Medium: X; Size: pp. 259-266","","","","Journal ID: JCTLA5; ISSN 0021-9517; TRN: IM9827%%215","10.1006/jcat.1998.2109","","2009-12-16T00:00:00Z","653321","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/653321","","Journal of Catalysis","2","177"

T{sub CH{sub 4}} did not exceed 320 C. Different sets were effected, corresponding to different values of T{sub H{sub 2}} (from room temperature to 200 C). If T{sub H{sub 2}} {le} 120 C hydrogenolysis was negligible, so that the variations of the production were only due to the changes affecting the adlayer. On both catalysts and at every value of T{sub H{sub 2}}, the production displayed a maximum versus T{sub CH{sub 4}}. On Pt, the selectivity to ethane and propane at a given T{sub H{sub 2}} monotonically decreased when T{sub CH{sub 4}} increased while that corresponding to the heavier products (C{sub 6}-C{sub 8}) increased. In contrast, on Ru, the selectivities to ethane and propane exhibited a minimum versus T{sub CH{sub 4}} while those to heptanes and octanes exhibited a maximum. The results are interpreted by assuming that, during the chemisorption of CH{sub 4}, several families of hydrocarbon precursors of different weights and shapes are formed on the metal surfaces. It must be assumed that, on Pt, the average weight of the precursors was an increasing function of T{sub CH{sub 4}}, whereas on Ru it displayed an optimum in the upper part of the explored range of T{sub CH{sub 4}}. No appreciable amount of unreactive carbon was formed under the conditions of the described experiments.","","","","","","United States","1998-07-01T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: Journal of Catalysis; Journal Volume: 177; Journal Issue: 1; Other Information: PBD: 1 Jul 1998","","Medium: X; Size: pp. 121-128","","","","Journal ID: JCTLA5; ISSN 0021-9517; TRN: IM9827%%210","10.1006/jcat.1998.2083","","2009-12-16T00:00:00Z","653316","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/653316","","Journal of Catalysis","1","177"

Distillation of different binary mixtures, namely ethanol-water, ethanol-benzene, and acetone-ethanol systems, of different compositions was experimentally studied in a continuous distillation column equipped with four, five, or six porous sintered stainless steel fractionating plates of 13.5 {micro}m pore diameter as well as six normal sieve plates. The results showed that the main factors affecting the separation efficiency in a given porous plate are the polarization of the pure liquids and the polarization difference between the mixture components. For the ethanol-water system, the results showed that while no separation was achieved in a distillation column with conventional stages, the zeotropic point of this system was broken in the distillation column with porous plates. A distillate of about 94 mol% ethanol was obtained for a feed of the zeotropic composition, i.e., 89.7 mol% ethanol. For the ethanol-benzene system, the azeotropic point was shifted from 40 mol% ethanol to about 30 mol% ethanol. For the acetone-ethanol system, there was no significant difference between the results obtained with normal stages and those with the porous plates. These results are in agreement with the developed theory.","","","","USDOE","","United States","1998-07-01T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: Separation Science and Technology; Journal Volume: 33; Journal Issue: 10; Other Information: PBD: Jul 1998","","Medium: X; Size: pp. 1529-1550","","","","Journal ID: SSTEDS; ISSN 0149-6395; TRN: IM9827%%295","10.1080/01496399808545064","","2016-05-04T00:00:00Z","653401","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/653401","","Separation Science and Technology","10","33"

The fuel-jet velocity is varied to investigate the Damkoehler number effects on gas emissions, localized extinction (LE) in the neck zone, and the structure of the recirculation zone dependency on the flow field. Simultaneous, single-point measurements of temperature, major species, OH, and NO are made using the Raman/Rayleigh/Laser induced fluorescence (LIF) technique. The data are collected at different axial and radial locations along the full length of most flames and are presented in the form of ensemble means, root-mean-square (rms) fluctuations, scatter plots, and probability density functions (PDF). It is found that up to three mixing layers may exist in the recirculation zone, one on the air side of the outer vortex, one between the inner and the outer vortices, and one between the fuel jet and the inner vortex. With increasing jet momentum flux, the average mixture in the outer vortex loses its strength and the stoichiometric contour shifts closer to the fuel jet. The decay rate of the mixture fraction on the centerline exhibits similar trends to the ordinary jet flame downstream of the recirculation zone whereas different trends are found inside the recirculation zone. The laminar flame computations with constant mass diffusivities and Lewis number (Le) = 1 are found to better guides for the measured temperature and stable species mass fraction in the turbulent flames. The measured peak mass fractions of CO and H{sub 2} are similar to those reported earlier for pilot-stabilized flames of similar fuels. Hydroxyl radical and H{sub 2} are found not to be in superflamelet levels contrary to earlier findings in piloted flames.","","","","","","United States","1998-07-01T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: Combustion and Flame; Journal Volume: 114; Journal Issue: 1-2; Other Information: PBD: Jul 1998","","Medium: X; Size: pp. 119-148","","","","Journal ID: CBFMAO; ISSN 0010-2180; TRN: IM9819%%236","10.1016/S0010-2180(97)00280-0","","2009-12-16T00:00:00Z","619646","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/619646","","Combustion and Flame","1-2","114"

The methanol (CH{sub 3}OH)-air triple flame is found to burn with an asymmetric shape due to the different chemical and transport processes characterizing the mixture. The excess fuel, CH{sub 3}OH, on the rich premixed flame branch is replaced by more stable fuels CO and H{sub 2} which burn at the diffusion flame. The general lean premixed flame side, a higher concentration of O{sub 2} leaks through to the diffusion flame. The general structure of the triple point features the contribution of both differential diffusion of radicals and heat. A mixture fraction-temperature phase plane description of the triple flame structure is proposed to highlight some interesting features in partially premixed combustion. The effects of differential diffusion at the triple point add to the contribution of hydrodynamic effects in the propagation of the triple flame. Differential diffusion effects are measured using two methods: a direct computation using diffusion velocities and an indirect computation based on the difference between the normalized mixture fractions of C and H. The mixture fraction approach does not clearly identify the effects of differential diffusion, in particular at the curved triple point, because of ambiguities in the contribution of carbon and hydrogen atoms` carrying species.","","","","","","United States","1998-07-01T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: Combustion and Flame; Journal Volume: 114; Journal Issue: 1-2; Other Information: PBD: Jul 1998","","Medium: X; Size: pp. 231-245","","","","Journal ID: CBFMAO; ISSN 0010-2180; TRN: IM9819%%241","10.1016/S0010-2180(97)00287-3","","2009-12-16T00:00:00Z","619651","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/619651","","Combustion and Flame","1-2","114"

A mixture of nonmethane hydrocarbons (NMHCs) and oxygenated hydrocarbons (OxHCs) was emitted from the surface at rates exhibiting large seasonal and year-to-year variations. The average emission rate (and standard error) of the total NMOCs around noontime on sunny days during the growing seasons for the 2-year period was 1,300 {+-} 170 {micro}g m-2 h-1 (mass of the total NMOCs per area of enclosed soil surface per hour) or 5.5 {+-} 0.9 {micro}g g-1 h-1 (mass of the total NMOCs per mass of dry plant biomass in an enclosure per hour), with about 10% and 70% of the emissions being composed of tentatively identified NMHCs and OxHCs, respectively. Methanol was apparently derived from both the soil and vegetation and exhibited an average emission rate of 460 {+-} 73 {micro}g m-2 h-1 (1.4 {+-} 0.2 {micro}g g-1 h-1), which was the largest emission among the NMOCs. The year-to-year variation in the precipitation pattern greatly affected the NMOC emission rates. Emission rates normalized to biomass density exhibited a linear decrease as the growing season progressed. The emission rates of some NMOCs, particularly the OxHCs, from vegetation subjected to hypoxia, frost, and physical stresses were significantly greater than the average values observed at the site. Emissions of monoterpenes (a- and {beta}-pinene, limonene, and myrcene) and cis-3-hexen-1-ol were accelerated during the flowering of the plants and were much greater than those predicted by algorithms that correlated emission rates with temperature. Herbaceous vegetation is estimated to contribute about 40% and 50% of the total NMOC and monoterpene emissions, respectively, in grasslands; the remaining contributions are from woody species within grasslands. Contributions of isoprene emissions from herbaceous vegetation in grasslands are negligible. Grasslands are estimated to contribute about 10% of the total biogenic NMOC emissions in the United States.","","","Argonne National Lab.

The alkali-promoted, C-supported Co-Mo sulfide catalyst that was employed in this study is well known for its sulfur resistance. The reaction was carried out in a gradientless Berty-type recycle reactor. A two-level fractional-factorial set consisting of 16 experiments was performed. Five independent variables were selected for this study, namely, temperature, partial pressure of carbon monoxide, partial pressure of hydrogen, partial pressure of inerts, and methanol concentration in the feed. The major oxygenated products were linear alcohols up to n-butanol, but alcohols of higher carbon number were also detected, and analysis of the liquid product revealed the presence of trace amounts of ethers also. Yields of hydrocarbons were non-negligible. The alcohol product followed an Anderson-Schultz-Flory distribution. From the results of the factorial experiments, a preliminary power-law model was developed, and the statistically significant variables in the rate expression for the production of each alcohol were found. Based on the results of the power-law models, rate expressions of the Langmuir-Hinshelwood type were fitted. The observed kinetics are consistent with the rate-limiting step for the production of each higher alcohol being a surface reaction of the alcohol of next-lower carbon number. All other steps, including CO-insertion, H{sub 2}-cleavage, and hydrogenation steps, do not appear to affect the rate correlations.","","","","","","United States","1998-06-01T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: Industrial and Engineering Chemistry Research; Journal Volume: 37; Journal Issue: 6; Other Information: PBD: Jun 1998","","Medium: X; Size: pp. 2107-2115","","","","Journal ID: IECRED; ISSN 0888-5885; TRN: IM9826%%135","10.1021/ie970391z","","2009-12-16T00:00:00Z","651179","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/651179","","Industrial and Engineering Chemistry Research","6","37"

This movement causes the oscillation of the catalyst temperature and is probably due to the reduction and oxidation of the catalyst by the reactants.","","","","","","United States","1998-06-01T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: Industrial and Engineering Chemistry Research; Journal Volume: 37; Journal Issue: 6; Other Information: PBD: Jun 1998","","Medium: X; Size: pp. 2333-2335","","","","Journal ID: IECRED; ISSN 0888-5885; TRN: IM9826%%146","10.1021/ie980027f","","2009-12-16T00:00:00Z","651190","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/651190","","Industrial and Engineering Chemistry Research","6","37"
"Combination of CO{sub 2} reforming and partial oxidation of methane over NiO/MgO solid solution catalysts","Ruckenstein, E; Hu, Y H","03 NATURAL GAS; 10 SYNTHETIC FUELS; METHANE; REFORMER PROCESSES; CARBON DIOXIDE; OXIDATION; NICKEL OXIDES; MAGNESIUM OXIDES; SYNTHESIS GAS; CHEMICAL REACTION YIELD; SILICON OXIDES; ALUMINIUM OXIDES; CATALYST SUPPORTS","To overcome the explosions that can occur during the partial oxidation of methane, the latter exothermic reaction is coupled with an endothermic one, namely, the CO{sub 2} reforming of CH{sub 4}. These combined reactions have been carried out over NiO/MgO solid solution, NiO/Al{sub 2}O{sub 3}, and NiO/SiO{sub 2} catalysts. About 90% conversion of CH{sub 4} and about 98% selectivities to CO and H{sub 2} were obtained at 790 C and a GHSV (gas hourly space velocity) of 90,000 cm{sup 3}/g h (O{sub 2}/CO{sub 2}/CH{sub 4} = 14.5/26.9/58.6), over a reduced NiO/MgO solid solution catalyst. Almost no change in activity and selectivity occurred during 50 h of reaction. Compared to the reduced NiO/MgO, the reduced NiO/SiO{sub 2} and NiO/Al{sub 2}O{sub 3} catalysts provided lower activities and stabilities. The effects of the reaction temperature, space velocity, and feed gas composition for a ratio CH{sub 4}/(CO{sub 2} + 2O{sub 2}) = 1 were investigated. The increase in O{sub 2} in the feed gas resulted in a higher conversion of CH{sub 4}, but the apparent conversion of CO{sub 2} passed through a maximum. The CH{sub 4} conversion decreased with increasing space velocity, while during the partial oxidation, because of the hot spots, it would have increased. This means that the coupling can, indeed, control the thermal behavior of the reactor.","","","","","","United States","1998-05-01T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: Industrial and Engineering Chemistry Research; Journal Volume: 37; Journal Issue: 5; Other Information: PBD: May 1998","","Medium: X; Size: pp. 1744-1747","","","","Journal ID: IECRED; ISSN 0888-5885; TRN: IM9820%%313","10.1021/ie9707883","","2009-12-16T00:00:00Z","624343","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/624343","","Industrial and Engineering Chemistry Research","5","37"

The ammonia adsorption over the catalysts was studied using temperature program desorption (TPD). The ethanol decomposition was studied over these catalysts, which has shown that the decomposition activity was higher for the catalyst calcined at 500 C than for the catalyst calcined at 800 C. However, the activity for ethanol decomposition was low over a K-Mo-unsupported sample. The activity and selectivity of the catalysts increased in the order of K-MoO{sub 3}/{gamma}-Al{sub 2}O{sub 3} < K-MoO{sub 3}/SiO{sub 2} < unsupported K-Mo. If the oxidized supported catalysts were recalcined at 800 C, the yields of CO{sub 2} and hydrocarbons were suppressed and the yields of mixed alcohols were remarkably enhanced.

The concentration of H{sub 2}O{sub 2} is measured as a function of reaction time in an optically accessible, high-pressure flow reactor by monitoring the intensity of a strong resonance in the Raman spectrum at 874 cm{sup {minus}1} that is characteristic of the O-O vibrational stretch. Transient concentrations of H{sub 2}O{sub 2} as high as 0.0065 mol/L (0.1% mole fraction) are measured during the oxidation of ethanol at feed mole fractions of 0.4% at 430 C and 24.5 MPa. Significantly lower transient concentrations of H{sub 2}O{sub 2} are observed during methanol oxidation. The experimentally observed transient H{sub 2}O{sub 2} concentration during methanol oxidation is compared to that predicted by two similar elementary reaction mechanisms and found to be distinctly lower than the models predict.","","","","","","United States","1998-05-01T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: Industrial and Engineering Chemistry Research; Journal Volume: 37; Journal Issue: 5; Other Information: PBD: May 1998","","Medium: X; Size: pp. 1755-1760","","","","Journal ID: IECRED; ISSN 0888-5885; TRN: IM9820%%314","10.1021/ie970711e","","2009-12-16T00:00:00Z","624344","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/624344","","Industrial and Engineering Chemistry Research","5","37"

Refining is assumed necessary, possibly overlooking the exception fuel qualities of syncrude for more direct utilization as a compression-ignition (CI) fuel. This paper evaluates cetane number, viscosity, cloud-point, and pour-point properties of syncrude and blends of syncrude with blend stocks such as ethanol and diethyl ether. The results show that blends comprised primarily of syncrude are potentially good CI fuels, with pour-point temperature depression being the largest development obstacle. The resulting blends may provide a much-needed and affordable alternative CI fuel. Particularly good market opportunities exist with Environmental Policy Act (EPACT) applications.","","","","","","United States","1998-05-01T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: Industrial and Engineering Chemistry Research; Journal Volume: 37; Journal Issue: 5; Other Information: PBD: May 1998","","Medium: X; Size: pp. 2029-2038","","","","Journal ID: IECRED; ISSN 0888-5885; TRN: IM9820%%321","10.1021/ie970746e","","2009-12-16T00:00:00Z","624351","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/624351","","Industrial and Engineering Chemistry Research","5","37"

The DFT methods (BLYP, BP86, BPW91, B3LYP, B3P86, B3PW91) give results in good agreement with second-order perturbation theory (MP2). The results in this paper provide evidence of the suitability of DFT methods for studying hydrogen-bonded adsorption complexes in zeolites. Generally, the hybrid DFT methods are in closer agreement with experiment and MP2 than the pure DFT methods for geometrical parameters. The only exception is the Z- geometry, perhaps due to its anionic character. All DFT methods give results in good overall agreement with MP2 for intramolecular geometrical parameters of the adsorption complexes, intramolecular vibrational frequencies, and adsorption energies. The B3LYP method gives intermolecular geometries and intermolecular vibrational frequencies which are closest to those obtained from the MP2 method. Thus, the B3LYP method seems to be the best choice for a density functional treatment of molecular adsorption in zeolite systems.","","","Argonne National Lab.

Alternative measures, which convert the natural gas to liquid fuel, include the Fischer-Tropsch conversion, methanol synthesis, and dimethyl ether (DME) synthesis. Comparisons are evaluated based on both transportation cost and feed-gas cost. The analysis will show that DME, one alternative to LNG as transportation fuel, will be more economical for longer distances between the natural-gas source and the consumer. LNG requires a costly tanker and receiving terminal. The break-even distance will be around 5,000--7,000 km and vary depending on the transported volume. There will be risk, however, since there has never been a DME plant the size of an LNG-equivalent plant [6 million metric tons/year (mty)].","","","","","","United States","1998-04-06T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: Oil and Gas Journal; Journal Volume: 96; Journal Issue: 14; Other Information: PBD: 6 Apr 1998","","Medium: X; Size: pp. 55-59","","","","Journal ID: OIGJAV; ISSN 0030-1388; TRN: IM9810%%184","","","2009-12-16T00:00:00Z","586088","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/586088","","Oil and Gas Journal","14","96"

Fischer-Tropsch synthesis was studied in a fixed-bed reactor over single-metal and bimetallic alloy catalysts, selected from Co, Ni, and Fe, supported on TiO{sub 2} at a total metal loading of 10 wt%. The catalysts, prepared by incipient wetness impregnation using nitrate precursors, were tested as is and in combination with a HZSM-5 zeolite. The test conditions were 1 MPa, 250 C, H{sub 2}/CO = 1, and weight hourly space velocity (WHSV) = 0.77 h{sup {minus}1}. Alloying of metals resulted in a significant enhancement in CO conversion without an increase in methane selectivity. A 50:50 weight ratio Co-Ni catalyst physically mixed with HZSM-5 (5% Co-5% Ni/TiO{sub 2} + HZSM-5) gave the highest CO conversion (45.2%) at the conditions tested. This compares to conversion of 8.9% and 10.5% with Co-only and Ni-only catalysts, respectively. Mixing the Co-Ni catalyst with HZSM-5 resulted in a significant reduction in methane selectivity and a significant increase in C{sub 4}{sup +} selectivity. The aromatic fraction increased from 1.5 to 8.1 wt%, the C{sub 2}{sup +} olefins were nearly eliminated, and i-C{sub 4}H{sub 10} increased from 2.3 to 58.5 wt % in the C{sub 4} fraction.","","","","","","United States","1998-04-01T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: Industrial and Engineering Chemistry Research; Journal Volume: 37; Journal Issue: 4; Other Information: PBD: Apr 1998","","Medium: X; Size: pp. 1181-1188","","","","Journal ID: IECRED; ISSN 0888-5885; TRN: IM9820%%284","10.1021/ie970680n","","2009-12-16T00:00:00Z","624314","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/624314","","Industrial and Engineering Chemistry Research","4","37"

Stoichiometric constraints are formulated in terms of three parameters characterizing the steam, partial oxidation, and carbon dioxide reforming reactions of methane. The equilibrium analysis is conducted using the methanol balance ratio {mu} and methane slip fraction {chi} as explicit design parameters. General results are derived for the feasibility of each ternary feed combination as a function of pressure and temperature in the range 1 < {mu} < 3 under carbon-free conditions. Numerical calculations indicate that CH{sub 4}/O{sub 2}/CO{sub 2} feeds can be used in single-stage adiabatic reformers at low values of {mu}, but the produced syngas requires further treatment. Reforming based on CH{sub 4}/O{sub 2}/H{sub 2}O feeds is endothermic at {mu} {ge} 2 under typical reaction conditions, thus requiring the application of a two-stage process involving primary and secondary reformers. Utilization of CH{sub 4}/O{sub 2}/H{sub 2}O feeds in single-stage adiabatic reactors is feasible for {mu} = 1.7--1.9, yielding syngas which can be upgraded by partial CO{sub 2} removal.

Once a steady-state oxygen-defect gradient is established (15--20 h), these membranes are found to be very stable under air/nitrogen gradients at temperatures up to 960 C and they respond instantaneously to temperature changes with an apparent activation energy of 159 kJ/mol. However, serious near-surface etching occurs when one side of the membrane is exposed to 100% CH{sub 4} at 850 C and atmospheric pressure, which resulted in dramatic increases in oxygen flux (a factor of 5). While this also caused an increase in the OCM reaction rate, the selectivity of C{sub 2+} hydrocarbons fell from 40 to 10%. It is also shown that stable operation under OCM conditions is possible if CH{sub 4} pressures are reduced to 0.1 atm but at a cost of C{sub 2+} production rate.","","","","","","United States","1998-04-01T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: Industrial and Engineering Chemistry Research; Journal Volume: 37; Journal Issue: 4; Other Information: PBD: Apr 1998","","Medium: X; Size: pp. 1290-1299","","","","Journal ID: IECRED; ISSN 0888-5885; TRN: IM9820%%291","10.1021/ie970761j","","2009-12-16T00:00:00Z","624321","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/624321","","Industrial and Engineering Chemistry Research","4","37"

Oxygen continuously transported from the air side appeared to stabilize the membrane interior, and the reactor was operated for up to 850 h.","","","","","","United States","1997-12-31T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: AIChE Journal; Journal Volume: 43; Journal Issue: 11A; Other Information: PBD: 1997","","Medium: X; Size: pp. 2741-2750","","","","Journal ID: AICEAC; ISSN 0001-1541; TRN: IM9803%%193","10.1002/aic.690431320","","2009-12-16T00:00:00Z","562246","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/562246","","AIChE Journal","11A","43"

A-site cations consisting of La{sub 0.4}Sr{sub 0.6} and La{sub 0.2}Ba{sub 0.8} produce materials with the highest oxygen fluxes and result in C{sub 2+} selectivities of 50% at 1,098 K, which are significantly higher than those achieved with a powdered catalyst in a packed-bed reactor configuration. Selectivities in these materials appear to be limited by high oxygen ion recombination rates that compete for oxygen with the desired coupling reaction(s). The results also indicate that oxygen fluxes are not limited by diffusion, but by surface exchange rates at the oxygen-lean side of the membrane. The study on stability of these materials showed that all three perovskites could be reduced in a pure methane or ethane stream at 1,023 K, but they were totally stable under reaction conditions where oxygen is present.","","","","","","United States","1997-12-31T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: AIChE Journal; Journal Volume: 43; Journal Issue: 11A; Other Information: PBD: 1997","","Medium: X; Size: pp. 2731-2740","","","","Journal ID: AICEAC; ISSN 0001-1541; TRN: IM9803%%192","10.1002/aic.690431319","","2009-12-16T00:00:00Z","562244","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/562244","","AIChE Journal","11A","43"

In this reactor that consists of two interconnected fluidized beds, i.e., reformer and combustor, heat that is needed for the highly endothermic CO{sub 2} reforming is generated by catalytic combustion of methane over a reforming catalyst. The heat generated in the combustor is supplied to the reformer with circulating solid particles. Circulation of solids is used not only for heat transport but also for catalyst regeneration. The experimental studies of CO{sub 2} reforming as well as of catalytic combustion of methane over a Ni (1 wt %)/{alpha}-Al{sub 2}O{sub 3} catalyst that were performed in a laboratory-scale fluidized-bed reactor (i.d. = 5 cm) confirmed the feasibility of this reactor concept.","","","","","","United States","1997-11-01T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: Industrial and Engineering Chemistry Research; Journal Volume: 36; Journal Issue: 11; Other Information: PBD: Nov 1997","","Medium: X; Size: pp. 4459-4465","","","","Journal ID: IECRED; ISSN 0888-5885; TRN: IM9804%%179","10.1021/ie970245t","","2009-12-16T00:00:00Z","564123","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/564123","","Industrial and Engineering Chemistry Research","11","36"

There are considerable reactor design and scale-up problems associated with synthesis gas conversion technologies which arise due to the special characteristics of these processes. Bubble columns and slurry bubble column reactors (SBCRs), due to their superior heat transfer characteristics, are the contactors of choice for conversion of syngas to fuels and chemicals. The multiphase fluid dynamics in these systems determines the mass and heat transfer and greatly affects reactor volumetric productivity and selectivity. Here the authors show how the recently collected data for liquid velocity, turbulence parameters, and holdup profiles can be used in guiding model development for liquid backmixing and in providing the needed model parameters. Predictions of the two-compartment convective-diffusion model for the residence time distribution of a nonvolatile tracer, which are based on measured liquid recirculation driven by the gas holdup profile and turbulence caused by the rising gas bubbles, are shown to be in good agreement with tracer data. The adaptation of model parameters needed to achieve predictability for industrial tracer data is discussed. The ability of the model to predict the liquid tracer responses at various locations in a SBCR during methanol synthesis is illustrated.","","","","USDOE, Washington, DC (United States)","","United States","1997-11-01T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: Industrial and Engineering Chemistry Research; Journal Volume: 36; Journal Issue: 11; Other Information: PBD: Nov 1997","","Medium: X; Size: pp. 4670-4680","","","FC22-95PC95051","Journal ID: IECRED; ISSN 0888-5885; TRN: IM9804%%193","","","2009-12-16T00:00:00Z","564150","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/564150","","Industrial and Engineering Chemistry Research","11","36"

The rationale of an integrated one-stage concept has been confirmed. High yields of C{sub 2}H{sub 4} and coproducts were obtained. An additivity of the yields of oxidative coupling and pyrolysis was observed under experimental conditions. The increase in C{sub 2}H{sub 4} yield, as compared with pyrolysis of naphtha, was proportional to the contribution of the coupling component. The C{sub 2}H{sub 4}/C{sub 2}H{sub 6} mole ratio was found to be as high as 4--5 for oxidative coupling with partial pyrolysis of C{sub 2}H{sub 6} and about 10 for the integrated process. Both air and oxygen can be used as oxidants in the coupling step. Depending on relative contributions of the coupling and pyrolysis components to the integrated process, an overall balance of CH{sub 4} could be negative (consumption) or positive (production). In the latter case, the integrated process could be based only on a liquid feedstock, with a recycle of CH{sub 4}.","","","","","","United States","1997-10-01T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: Industrial and Engineering Chemistry Research; Journal Volume: 36; Journal Issue: 10; Other Information: PBD: Oct 1997","","Medium: X; Size: pp. 4193-4197","","","","Journal ID: IECRED; ISSN 0888-5885; TRN: IM9803%%124","10.1021/ie960711z","","2009-12-16T00:00:00Z","562121","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/562121","","Industrial and Engineering Chemistry Research","10","36"

These results are used in a physical equation of state, the statistical associating fluid theory (SAFT), in order to model the phase behavior of these hydrogen-bonding compounds. A procedure has been developed to relate the calculated enthalpy and entropy changes to the association parameters in SAFT using only low-pressure data, as well as to relate molar volumes from molecular orbital calculations to the segment size and chain length parameters in SAFT. By doing so, the SAFT model is reduced to a three-parameter equation of state for associating fluids.

These fuel applications require significant reductions in manufacturing cost, particularly in plant investment. The present study evaluates the savings in investment that could be achieved by applying various emerging manufacturing technologies. The most advanced technologies are based on the intermediate production of synthesis gas. They are based on new re-forming technologies or various once-through methanol synthesis schemes. The newest manufacturing technologies either proceed via methyl chloride or methyl bisulfate or apply direct partial oxidation.

The validity of OCM kinetic equations employed in the modeling is confirmed by excellent agreement between the simulation and experimental data for OCM on FBR. For FBR, a high methane to oxygen feed ratio favors the OCM reaction, with a low C{sub 2} yield because of insufficient oxygen supply. The highest C{sub 2} yield achieved with a feed mixture consisting of 70% methane and 30% oxygen is 20.7% at a selectivity of 53% and operating temperature of 750 C. The C{sub 2} yield and selectivity increase slightly at a higher operating temperature. The optimal feed ratio does not change with temperature. DMR is made of a mixed-conducting ceramic membrane tube packed with an OCM catalyst. The membrane tube separates the methane and oxygen feed. The oxygen concentration in the DMR is much lower and more uniform than that in the FBR because of the different reactant feeding mode and logarithmic dependence of oxygen flux on oxygen partial pressures of the dense ceramic membrane. This results in a significantly increased C{sub 2} selectivity and yield for the DMR as compared to the FBR.","","","","","","United States","1997-09-01T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: Industrial and Engineering Chemistry Research; Journal Volume: 36; Journal Issue: 9; Other Information: PBD: Sep 1997","","Medium: X; Size: pp. 3583-3593","","","","Journal ID: IECRED; ISSN 0888-5885; TRN: IM9746%%150","10.1021/ie9606698","","2009-12-16T00:00:00Z","538224","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/538224","","Industrial and Engineering Chemistry Research","9","36"

The first step was to study the reaction kinetics and chemical equilibrium, using a polymeric acid catalyst (Amberlyst-15). Acetone was identified as a suitable medium to enable single liquid phase operation and also to enhance the reaction rate. It was found that the intraparticle mass-transfer resistance is negligible at temperatures below 70 C. A kinetic expression, based on Langmuir-Hinshelwood formalism, is proposed. The forward and reverse reactions show first-order dependence on isoamylenes and TAA, respectively, while water is essentially an inhibitor of the reaction in both directions.

The catalyst dilution has beneficial effects for achieving a higher C{sub 2}H{sub 4}/C{sub 2}H{sub 6} ratio and also for reducing the hazardous nature of the OCM process because of the coupling of the exothermic oxidative conversion reactions and the endothermic thermal cracking reactions and also due to the increased heat transfer area.","","","","","","United States","1997-09-01T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: Industrial and Engineering Chemistry Research; Journal Volume: 36; Journal Issue: 9; Other Information: PBD: Sep 1997","","Medium: X; Size: pp. 3594-3601","","","","Journal ID: IECRED; ISSN 0888-5885; TRN: IM9746%%151","10.1021/ie960676w","","2009-12-16T00:00:00Z","538225","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/538225","","Industrial and Engineering Chemistry Research","9","36"

Because of this, the process is operated in the most energy-efficient and safe manner. The influence of various process variables (viz. temperature, NG/O{sub 2} and steam/NG ratios in feed, and space velocity) on the conversion of carbon and also of the individual hydrocarbons in natural gas, the selectivity for C{sub 2}-C{sub 4} olefins, and also on the net heat of reactions in the process has been thoroughly investigated. By carrying out the process at 800--850 C in the presence of steam (H{sub 2}O/NG {le} 0.2) and using limited O{sub 2} in the feed (NG/O{sub 2} = 12--18), high selectivity for ethylene (about 60%) or C{sub 2}-C{sub 4} olefins (above 80%) at the carbon conversion (>15%) of practical interest could be achieved at high space velocity ({ge}34,000 cm{sup 3}/g (catalyst) h), requiring no external energy and also without forming coke or tar-like products. The net heat of reactions can be controlled and the process can be made mildly exothermic or even close to thermoneutral by manipulating the O{sub 2} concentration in the feed.","","","","","","United States","1997-09-01T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: Industrial and Engineering Chemistry Research; Journal Volume: 36; Journal Issue: 9; Other Information: PBD: Sep 1997","","Medium: X; Size: pp. 3520-3527","","","","Journal ID: IECRED; ISSN 0888-5885; TRN: IM9746%%146","10.1021/ie9607964","","2009-12-16T00:00:00Z","538220","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/538220","","Industrial and Engineering Chemistry Research","9","36"

New hydrocarbon fuels with high-energy density content can substantially advance high-thrust, high-temperature, an reduced-size combustion technology. The present work investigates the phase change dynamics of the PCU alkene dimer, a newly synthesized high-energy density hydrocarbon fuel, in turbulent reacting flows. The shape, location, and velocity of the propellant-gas interface is treated explicitly. A Lagrangian moving grid technique in conjunction with an established body-fitted field equation solver is developed. Owing to the complex flow structure and uneven heat flux distribution along the propellant surface, the interface experiences nonuniform regression between the front and the rear ends. Consistent with experimental observations, the thermal characteristics near the solid-gas interface vary in space and time. The present computational capacity can advance ones understanding of phase change, thermal decomposition, and subsequent mixing and burning dynamics of the energetic fuel.","","","","USDOE","","United States","1997-08-08T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: Numerical Heat Transfer.

These materials, when promoted with alkali, have been found to have a high activity for the production of alcohols from synthesis gas. The effects of the catalyst preparation temperature (i.e., decomposition temperature) and reaction conditions (temperature, flow rate) have been studied, as well as the effect of the type and concentration of the alkali promoter. In all cases, the alcohols formed are primarily straight-chain, terminal {single_bond}OH compounds. The variations in preparation procedure have only small effects on the conversion and the selectivity to higher alcohols. Increasing the reactant flow rate increases the selectivity to methanol at the expense of the hydrocarbons and the higher-molecular-weight alcohols. Increasing the reaction temperature changes the selectivity toward higher alcohols but also changes the selectivity toward hydrocarbons. A maximum in selectivity to higher alcohols with the reaction temperature is observed for all catalysts tested.","","","","USDOE, Washington, DC (United States)","","United States","1997-08-01T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: Industrial and Engineering Chemistry Research; Journal Volume: 36; Journal Issue: 8; Other Information: PBD: Aug 1997","","Medium: X; Size: pp. 3085-3093","","","AC22-91PC91034","Journal ID: IECRED; ISSN 0888-5885; TRN: IM9745%%253","10.1021/ie960648d","","2009-12-16T00:00:00Z","536414","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/536414","","Industrial and Engineering Chemistry Research","8","36"

In any case, gasification products include synthesis gas, carbon monoxide, hydrogen, steam, carbon dioxide, and power. The more a gasification facility is integrated with utilities and other non-core operations of a production complex, the more economical the products are for all consumers. The paper discusses gasification of natural gas, light hydrocarbons (ethane, propanes, and butanes), and heavy hydrocarbons (distillates, heavy residues, asphalts, coals, petroleum coke).

The controlled sinusoidal acoustic field in the combustor had a sound pressure level of 155 dB and a frequency of 80 Hz. Experiments were performed to study the effect of oscillations on Sauter-mean and arithmetic-mean diameters, droplet velocity, and droplet number density for the present operating conditions of the Rijke-tube combustor. Similar measurements were also performed on a water spray in the propane-fired reactor to study the effect of the acoustic field on the atomization process for the nozzle type used. Spectral analysis of the droplet axial velocity component for the oscillating conditions revealed a dominant frequency equal to the frequency of the sinusoidal acoustic wave in the combustor. The Sauter-mean diameter of the ethanol spray decreased by 15%, on average, in the presence of the acoustic field because of enhanced evaporation, while the droplet arrival rate at the probe volume increased due to changes in the flame structure. Analysis of the measured size distributions indicated that under an oscillating flow there was a larger population of droplets in the diameter range of 3--20 {micro}m. Experiments conducted with the water spray indicated that the oscillations did affect droplet size distributions in the ethanol spray due to enhanced evaporation caused by the relocation of the flame front inside and around the spray cone.","","","","National Science Foundation, Washington, DC (United States); Conselho Nacional de Desenvolvimento Cientifico e Tecnologico (CNPq), Sao Paulo, SP (Brazil); USDOE, Washington, DC (United States)","","United States","1997-07-01T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: Combustion and Flame; Journal Volume: 110; Journal Issue: 1-2; Other Information: PBD: Jul 1997","","Medium: X; Size: pp. 25-38","","","","Journal ID: CBFMAO; ISSN 0010-2180; TRN: IM9748%%37","10.1016/S0010-2180(97)00061-8","","2009-12-16T00:00:00Z","543427","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/543427","","Combustion and Flame","1-2","110"

The modified electrode exhibits significant electrocatalytic activity for the oxidation of methanol. The catalytic activities were found to be dependent on Pt loading and the thickness of the PPy film. The linearly adsorbed CO species is the only intermediate of electrochemical oxidation of methanol and can be readily oxidized at the modified electrodes. The enhanced electrocatalytic activities may be due to the uniform dispersion of Pt microparticles in the PPy film and the synergistic effects of the highly dispersed Pt microparticles and the PPy film.

And, compared to the conventional approach, catalytic distillation may also improve other factors, such as reactant conversion, selectivity, mass transfer, operating pressure, oligomer formation and catalyst fouling. The constant washing of the catalyst by liquid flowing down the column and the distillation of high-boiling foulants results in extended catalyst life.

The methanol oxidation products on platinum black and platinum-ruthenium catalyst surfaces were determined as a function of the fuel cell operating temperature, current density, and methanol/water mole ratio. Neither formaldehyde nor formic acid was detected in anode exhaust gas at all cell operating conditions. The product distributions of methanol oxidation obtained by on-line FTIRS are consistent with previous results obtained by on-line mass spectroscopy under similar conditions. With pure methanol in anode feed, methanaldimethylacetal was found to be the main product, methyl formate and CO{sub 2} were also found. However, when water was present in the anode feed, the main product was CO{sub 2}, and the formation of methanal-dimethylacetal and methyl formate decreased significantly with increase of the water/methanol mole ratio. Increase of cell operating temperature enhanced the formation of CO{sub 2} and decreased the formation of methanaldimethylacetal and methyl formate. Pt/Ru catalyst is more active for methanol oxidation and has a higher selectivity toward CO{sub 2} formation than Pt-black. Nearly complete methanol oxidation, i.e., the product was almost exclusively CO{sub 2}, was achieved using a Pt/Ru catalyst and a water/methanol mole ratio of 2 or higher in the anode feed at a temperature of 185 C or above.","","","","Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency, Arlington, VA (United States)","","United States","1997-06-01T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: Journal of the Electrochemical Society; Journal Volume: 144; Journal Issue: 6; Other Information: PBD: Jun 1997","","Medium: X; Size: pp. 1917-1922","","","","Journal ID: JESOAN; ISSN 0013-4651; TRN: IM9738%%202","10.1149/1.1837721","","2016-05-25T00:00:00Z","516892","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/516892","","Journal of the Electrochemical Society","6","144"

The model is based on surface science measurements and it includes the dynamic changes in particle shape and active surface area which have recently been observed by in situ EXAFS measurements to take place upon change in the redox potential of the reaction gas. It is suggested that the change in particle morphology is related to a change in the number of oxygen vacancies at the Zn-O-Cu interface. Furthermore, the structure sensitivity of the methanol synthesis reaction is also taken into account. The dynamic microkinetic model is seen to give a much better description of the kinetic measurements over a working methanol catalyst compared to a static microkinetic model.

Simulation of reactors with parallel-flow and counterflow configuration has been performed to study the methane steam re-forming reaction in a packed-bed inert membrane reactor (PBIMR).

In the model a dense Pd membrane was simulated, assuming an infinite permselectivity to hydrogen. Membrane reactor performance was compared to that of a conventional fixed-bed reactor. The effect on the degree of conversion was analyzed for different parameters such as temperature, reactor pressure, feed and sweep flow rate, feed molar ratio, membrane thickness, and space velocity. Comparison with experimental data of Shu et al. (1994) showed a good agreement. An analysis of the results indicated that the choice of operating conditions requires a complex process strategy.","","","","","","United States","1997-06-01T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: Industrial and Engineering Chemistry Research; Journal Volume: 36; Journal Issue: 6; Other Information: PBD: Jun 1997","","Medium: X; Size: pp. 2121-2127","","","","Journal ID: IECRED; ISSN 0888-5885; TRN: IM9737%%117","10.1021/ie9601615","","2009-12-16T00:00:00Z","514624","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/514624","","Industrial and Engineering Chemistry Research","6","36"

Comparisons are made with literature data for congealing point, density, specific heat, viscosity, thermal conductivity, and surface tension. Mixture property predictions are based on appropriate average carbon numbers and on a general property mixing rule. Both ideal and nonideal solution behavior are exhibited. For the nonideal properties, viscosity and surface tension, mixing rules are proposed and parameters regressed to obtain reasonable agreement with mixture data. Property estimates based on the appropriate average carbon number are probably sufficient for most engineering applications. Methods are outlined for estimating different carbon-number averages based on congealing- and melting-point, density, and the Anderson-Schulz-Flory distribution when the carbon number distribution of the mixture is not available. The presence of other Fischer-Tropsch byproducts appears to have little effect on the accuracy of predictions made for high molecular weight mixtures.","","","","USDOE Pittsburgh Energy Technology Center, PA (United States)","","United States","1997-06-01T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: Industrial and Engineering Chemistry Research; Journal Volume: 36; Journal Issue: 6; Other Information: PBD: Jun 1997","","Medium: X; Size: pp. 2409-2420","","","","Journal ID: IECRED; ISSN 0888-5885; TRN: IM9737%%134","10.1021/ie9605140","","2009-12-16T00:00:00Z","514641","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/514641","","Industrial and Engineering Chemistry Research","6","36"

The decrease in the strong basicity and catalytic activity/selectivity or yield is mostly due to strong chemical interactions between the active catalyst component (viz., MgO and La{sub 2}O{sub 3}) and the reactive components of the catalyst support (viz., Al{sub 2}O{sub 3} and SiO{sub 2}), resulting in the formation of catalytically inactive binary metal oxides on the support surface. However, the influence of support on the activity/selectivity of La{sub 2}O{sub 3} is relatively very small, and also the chemical interactions of La{sub 2}O{sub 3} with the supports (except that containing a high concentration of SiO{sub 2}) are almost absent. The catalyst-support interactions are thus found to be strongly dependent upon the nature (chemical composition) of both catalyst and support. For developing better supported catalysts for the oxidative coupling of methane, supported La{sub 2}O{sub 3} with some promoters shows high promise.","","","","","","United States","1997-06-01T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: Industrial and Engineering Chemistry Research; Journal Volume: 36; Journal Issue: 6; Other Information: PBD: Jun 1997","","Medium: X; Size: pp. 2096-2100","","","","Journal ID: IECRED; ISSN 0888-5885; TRN: IM9737%%116","10.1021/ie960318t","","2009-12-16T00:00:00Z","514623","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/514623","","Industrial and Engineering Chemistry Research","6","36"

The data were measured with a flow reactor at low conversions (<0.005) such that reaction of ethane took place in the near absence of alkenes. Catalysis was demonstrated for ethane conversion in the presence of FMSZ at 450{degrees}C and 0.2 atm ethane partial pressure, but the reactions were not shown to be catalytic for the other solid acids and other conditions. FMSZ was active for converting ethane into methane, ethene, and butane at an ethane partial pressure of 0.2 atm and at temperatures of 200-300{degrees}C; the other solid acids had no detectable activities under these conditions. At higher temperatures, each of the solid acids was active for conversion of ethane into ethene; butane and methane were also formed in the presence of FMSZ, HZSM-5, and USY zeolite, whereas methane was the only other hydrocarbon observed in the presence of SZ. The initial (5 min on stream) selectivities to ethene at approximately 0.1 % conversion, ethane partial pressure of 0.2 atm, and 450{degrees}C were approximately 98, 94, 97, and 99%, for SZ, FMSZ, HZSM-5, and USY zeolite, respectively. Under the same reaction conditions, the initial rates of ethane conversion were 0. 1 5 x 10{sup -8}, 3.5 x 10{sup -8} 3.9 x 10{sup -8}, and 0.56 x 10{sup -8} mol/(s {circ} g) for SZ, FMSZ, HZSM-5, and USY zeolite, respectively.

The reaction was carried out in a quartz lined tubular reactor at 643--703 K, 30--50 bar and residence times of 30--100 s. Air was used as the oxidizing agent and the CH{sub 4}/O{sub 2} ratio in the feed was varied from 8 to 16. Kinetic modeling studies were also carried out by using a free radical scheme consisting of a set of 46 elementary reactions. The results predicted by the model are in fair agreement with the experimental data. Increasing CO{sub 2} levels in the feed (3--15%) did not have an adverse effect on methane conversion and methanol selectivity but increased HCHO selectivity to a small extent. Increasing O{sub 2} concentrations in the feed was found to increase the HCHO/CH{sub 3}OH ratio as well as temperature required for high conversions. The need for higher temperatures is probably due to the increase in N{sub 2} levels in the feed. The methane conversion of 7% and a methanol selectivity of 54% at 703 K and 34 bar obtained in this study compare well with the values reported in the literature. The model predicts that increasing H{sub 2} levels in the feed at high oxygen conversions decreases methanol selectivity without affecting methane conversion.","","","","","","United States","1997-05-01T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: Industrial and Engineering Chemistry Research; Journal Volume: 36; Journal Issue: 5; Other Information: PBD: May 1997","","Medium: X; Size: pp. 1401-1409","","","","Journal ID: IECRED; ISSN 0888-5885; TRN: IM9735%%214","10.1021/ie960666v","","2009-12-16T00:00:00Z","509341","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/509341","","Industrial and Engineering Chemistry Research","5","36"

Since molybdenum contains overlapping contribution of the first and the second shells, EXAFS of these two shells and the first shell of platinum was analyzed for the bimetallic catalysts. EXAFS showed equivocally the formation of bimetallic bonds between Mo and Pt for all bimetallic catalysts. For all bimetallic catalysts, molybdenum seemed to segregate to the surface irrespective of the sequence of the impregnation. Strong interaction of Mo atoms with the support was also identified with EXAFS and XANES for both monometallic Mo catalysts and bimetallic catalysts. Regarding the activities of CO hydrogenation, it was concluded that reduced Mo sites were responsible for the high activity and that Pt helped Mo sites become more reduced. 28 refs., 6 figs., 5 tabs.","","","","","","United States","1997-04-15T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: Journal of Catalysis; Journal Volume: 167; Journal Issue: 2; Other Information: PBD: 15 Apr 1997","","Medium: X; Size: pp. 364-371","","","","Journal ID: JCTLA5; ISSN 0021-9517; TRN: 97:003377-0006","10.1006/jcat.1997.1578","","2009-12-16T00:00:00Z","563476","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/563476","","Journal of Catalysis","2","167"

Nevertheless, for the energetic use of methanol to be competitive with existing fuels, it requires a considerably lower production cost. The discovery of more active catalysts that can function at very low temperatures (*60--150 C) could lead to attractive alternatives to current processes. These investigations into the catalytic systems revealed that the synthesis of methanol consists of two steps: methanol carbonylation to methyl formate and the successive hydrogenolysis (removal of a substituent using hydrogen) of methyl formate to methanol, leading to a net gain of one molecule of methanol. The reactions can be carried out concurrently, in a single reactor (single-stage process), or in two separate reactors (two-step process); here the authors discuss both processes and describe some of the major obstacles to overcome in order to develop a radically improved process.","","","","","","United States","1997-04-01T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: CHEMTECH; Journal Volume: 27; Journal Issue: 4; Other Information: PBD: Apr 1997","","Medium: X; Size: pp. 27-31","","","","Journal ID: CHTEDD; ISSN 0009-2703; TRN: IM9726%%234","","","2009-12-16T00:00:00Z","483841","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/483841","","CHEMTECH","4","27"

For example, does a catalyst particle show any tendency to thermal oscillations in the form of a limit cycle? The root to such cycles is found in the eigenvalues of the Jacobian matrix to the reaction rate vector, applying the concept of reaction invariance, a direct consequence of Avogadro`s stoichiometric principle for homogeneous stirred tank reactors. However, this concept does not generally apply to heterogeneous reactor dynamics, because it is found in the heterogeneous transports of heat, reactants and products. The transport is an irreversible phenomenon that usually contributes to shifting the eigenvalues to the left and hence increases the stability. Still, effects of transport mechanisms, both internally and externally, on the catalyst particle are important to assess in such industrial analyses. A practical industrial reactor for methanol production was the subject for stability studies, which concluded that thermal oscillations are not likely to occur. During this study, a number of interesting details were examined such as rank deficiency of the reaction matrix and root loci for the temperature dependence of the Jacobian matrix eigenvalues. A practical consequence of eventual thermal cycling of the catalyst particles is a long-term degradation of the catalyst efficiency, as seen in the ammonia synthesis.","","","","","","United States","1997-04-01T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: AIChE Journal; Journal Volume: 43; Journal Issue: 4; Other Information: PBD: Apr 1997","","Medium: X; Size: pp. 1082-1090","","","","Journal ID: AICEAC; ISSN 0001-1541; TRN: IM9726%%240","10.1002/aic.690430421","","2009-12-16T00:00:00Z","483847","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/483847","","AIChE Journal","4","43"

Series of four or eight columns were used. The experiments were carried out with low concentration mixtures, that is, under linear conditions. Band profiles of both compounds eluted from one of the columns during successive periods after steady state had been reached were recorded, as were the concentration histories at the extract and raffinate ports. These experimental results are compared to those predicted by two models: the linear ideal and the linear equilibrium-dispersive models of chromatography, applied to the SMB separator. These two models give excellent agreement between the experimental profiles and those calculated with the model. As expected, the profiles predicted by the ideal and the equilibrium-dispersive models differ only by the lack of dispersion in the profiles given by the former. The latter model is demonstrated to be a solid, reliable tool for further studies of the SMB design and optimization.","","","","National Science Foundation, Washington, DC (United States); Tennessee Univ., Knoxville, TN (United States); Oak Ridge National Lab., TN (United States)","","United States","1997-04-01T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: AIChE Journal; Journal Volume: 43; Journal Issue: 4; Other Information: PBD: Apr 1997","","Medium: X; Size: pp. 935-945","","","","Journal ID: AICEAC; ISSN 0001-1541; TRN: IM9726%%238","10.1002/aic.690430409","","2009-12-16T00:00:00Z","483845","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/483845","","AIChE Journal","4","43"

In agreement with X-ray diffraction results, electrical conductivity has shown that heat treatment of vanadyl pyrophosphates between 450 and 800{degrees}C results in a less conducting state corresponding to a very crystalline form. Such a stabilized form can already be reached at a temperature between 600 and 700{degrees}C. For V-P-O catalysts, electrical conductivity decreased as a function of the activation time, tact, under the reaction mixture, reaching a steady value for tact > 84 h. Both types of solids were found to be p- type semiconductors with positive holes as the main charge carriers. During subsequent exposures to n-butane and to oxygen at reaction temperature (400{degrees}C), it was confirmed that vanadyl pyrophosphate constitutes the main phase of efficient V-P-O catalysts working with some excess of surface oxygen probably in relation with the presence of V{sup 5+} species. The recorded changes in conductivity upon exposure to reactants provide illustrative evidence of a redox (Mars and van Krevelen) mechanism. The long activation period necessary to produce a high yield of maleic anhydride corresponds to structural and chemical changes of the surface which accommodates the reaction mixture and gives rise to active and selective sites able to convert n-butane to maleic anhydride. 45 refs., 10 figs., 3 tabs.","","","","","","United States","1997-04-01T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: Journal of Catalysis; Journal Volume: 167; Journal Issue: 1; Other Information: PBD: 1 Apr 1997","","Medium: X; Size: pp. 106-117","","","","Journal ID: JCTLA5; ISSN 0021-9517; TRN: 97:003365-0008","10.1006/jcat.1997.1537","","2009-12-16T00:00:00Z","563503","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/563503","","Journal of Catalysis","1","167"

The addition of potassium produces a strong decrease of the BET area and of the amounts of the adsorbed molecules. At the same time the spectrum of the sample reduced with H{sub 2} at 573-773 K shows, under anhydrous conditions, the presence of small patches of reduced Fe{sup 0}, not easily formed on Fe/ZrO{sub 2} under the same thermal and reducing conditions. The formation of new phases containing iron and potassium in close combination, such as mixed iron-potassium oxalates and potassium ferrites that fully cover the zirconia surface, was inferred from FTIR data. CO adsorption favors the partial surface reduction of these phases producing small Fe-carbonyl clusters in tight contact with potassium and Fe,K-carboxylate surface species. The adsorption of NO, producing nitrosyl species on the reduced iron particles and nitrite groups on the potassium phase is in good agreement with the results of adsorbed CO. These results are confirmed by quantitative determinations of adsorbed gases and by TPR experiments. 37 refs., 9 figs., 2 tabs.","","","","","","United States","1997-04-01T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: Journal of Catalysis; Journal Volume: 167; Journal Issue: 1; Other Information: PBD: 1 Apr 1997","","Medium: X; Size: pp. 153-163","","","","Journal ID: JCTLA5; ISSN 0021-9517; TRN: 97:003365-0011","10.1006/jcat.1997.1524","","2009-12-16T00:00:00Z","563506","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/563506","","Journal of Catalysis","1","167"

At reaction temperatures of T = 373 K and T = 393 K a propan-2-ol conversion of 50 and 100%, respectively, and the formation of propene, diisopropyl. ether, and small amounts of acetone was determined by GC. Applying in situ {sup 1}H and {sup 13}C MAS NMR spectroscopy, the initial step of the reaction was found to be the physisorption of propan-2-ol on Bronsted acid sites. A formation of isopropoxy species could be excluded by {sup 13}C MAS NMR spectroscopy. {sup 1}H MAS NMR spectroscopy indicated that the Bronsted acid sites of the zeolites LaNaY and HY were hydrated by water molecules in the first part of the induction period. These water molecules were formed in result of the propan-2-ol dehydration. The strong low-field shift of the {sup 1}H MAS NMR signals of the hydrated Bronsted acid sites is due to a partial protonation of adsorbed water molecules. At T = 393 K, a significant {sup 13}C MAS NMR signal of strongly bonded acetone molecules appeared at 220 ppm in the spectra of zeolites LaNaY and HY. As demonstrated by propan-2-ol conversion on a partially dealuminated zeolite HY, this by-reaction is promoted by extra-framework aluminium species. The formation of coke precursors which caused {sup 13}C MAS NMR signals at 10-50 ppm is explained by an oligomerization of propene. In situ {sup 13}C MAS NMR experiments carried out under a continuous flow of propene showed that the above-mentioned coke precursors are also formed on partially rehydrated zeolite HY. 25 refs., 14 figs., 1 tab.","","","","","","United States","1997-04-01T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: Journal of Catalysis; Journal Volume: 167; Journal Issue: 1; Other Information: PBD: 1 Apr 1997","","Medium: X; Size: pp. 187-197","","","","Journal ID: JCTLA5; ISSN 0021-9517; TRN: 97:003365-0015","10.1006/jcat.1997.1562","","2009-12-16T00:00:00Z","563510","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/563510","","Journal of Catalysis","1","167"

All the perovskite precursors were prereduced in situ, producing cobalt metal finely dispersed over the rare earth sesquioxide support described here as Ln-Co-O. Of the catalyst tested, the system Gd-Co-O showed exceptionally better performance for CO and H{sub 2} production (with methane conversion of 73% and selectivities of 79 and 81% for CO and H{sub 2}, respectively, at 1009 K). The production of synthesis gas over the other catalysts decreased in the following order: Sm-Co-O {much_gt} Nd-Co-O > Pr-Co-O. The catalyst La-Co-O was active for methane combustion and only traces of CO and H{sub 2} were observed under the reaction conditions. Based on results obtained here, it is proposed that the deactivation of the catalysts Ln-Co-O by reoxidation of cobalt metal is related to the thermodynamic stability of the parent perovskite structure. The authors also present evidence that hydroxyl groups on the rare earth oxide, specially in the La-Co-O system, might make some contribution to the reoxidation of cobalt metal during the reaction via a reverse spillover process. 48 refs., 12 figs., 2 tabs.","","","","","","United States","1997-04-01T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: Journal of Catalysis; Journal Volume: 167; Journal Issue: 1; Other Information: PBD: 1 Apr 1997","","Medium: X; Size: pp. 198-209","","","","Journal ID: JCTLA5; ISSN 0021-9517; CNN: Contract MAT95-0894; TRN: 97:003365-0016","10.1006/jcat.1997.1580","","2009-12-16T00:00:00Z","563511","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/563511","","Journal of Catalysis","1","167"

The results showed that isomorphous substitution took place between copper and zinc in the precipitates. The addition of Al to the binary system made the copper and zinc in the catalyst exist in much smaller crystallites and exhibit an amorphous-like structure. The effects of composition, structure, and surface property of the catalysts as well as the reaction condition on the activity and selectivity to methanol for methanol synthesis from CO{sub 2} + H{sub 2} were investigated. The activity was found to increase with the in- crease of surface area of metallic copper in the range of 10-60% of copper content, but it decreased as the copper content exceeded 60%, although the metallic copper surface area was higher. This was explained by the strong synergy between copper and zinc oxide. The effect of contact time on the relative selectivity ({gamma} = S{sub CH3OH}/S{sub CO}) and selectivity of methanol was also investigated. The results indicated that methanol was formed directly from hydrogenation of CO{sub 2}.","","","","","","United States","1997-04-01T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: Journal of Catalysis; Journal Volume: 167; Journal Issue: 1; Other Information: PBD: 1 Apr 1997","","Medium: X; Size: pp. 92-105","","","","Journal ID: JCTLA5; ISSN 0021-9517; TRN: 97:003365-0007","10.1006/jcat.1997.1554","","2009-12-16T00:00:00Z","563502","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/563502","","Journal of Catalysis","1","167"

The open-circuit voltage was reduced by 100 mV and polarization at 400 mA/cm{sup 2} was reduced by 180 mV. A Pt/Ru (5:2) catalyst with the same Pt content lowered the open-circuit voltage 70 mV.

A possible mechanism for the reaction of methane is discussed. 37 refs., 7 figs., 3 tabs.","","","","USDOE","","United States","1997-03-01T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: Journal of Catalysis; Journal Volume: 166; Journal Issue: 2; Other Information: PBD: Mar 1997","","Medium: X; Size: pp. 244-253","","","","Journal ID: JCTLA5; ISSN 0021-9517; CNN: Contract T 014921; TRN: 97:002241-0012","10.1006/jcat.1997.1519","","2016-05-02T00:00:00Z","478764","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/478764","","Journal of Catalysis","2","166"

The activity of a Dawson-type tungstophosphoric acid, H{sub 6}P{sub 2}W{sub 18}O{sub 62}/SiO{sub 2}, was comparable to that of a sulfonated polymer resin, Amberlyst 15, and the selectivity was higher than that of Amberlyst 15. A Keggin-type heteropoly-acid, H{sub 3}PW{sub 12}O{sub 40}/SiO{sub 2}, was also efficient for this reaction, while unsupported H{sub 3}PW{sub 12}O{sub 40} was much less active than unsupported H{sub 6}P{sub 2}W{sub 18}O{sub 62}. Calorimetry of NH{sub 3} absorption revealed that the difference in acid strength between H{sub 6}P{sub 2}W{sub 18}O{sub 62} and H{sub 3}PW{sub 12}O{sub 40} was large, but the difference between the two became smaller when they were supported. This partly explains the similar activities of the two supported heteropolyacids. By supporting H{sub 6}P{sub 2}W{sub 18}O{sub 62} on SiO{sub 2}, the MTBE selectivity on the basis of methanol increased, but the selectivity on the basis of isobutylene decreased, which was reasonably explained by the decrease of the relative contribution of pseudoliquid phase reaction to the surface reaction by supporting.

The high aromatization activity of this catalyst is attributed to its high dehydrogenation activity due to the presence of high dispersed nonframework Ga-oxide species (which are formed during hydrothermal synthesis and/or pretreatments to the zeolite) along with the zeolitic acid sites (or framework Ga), resulting in a bifunctional catalyst. However, this zeolite undergoes fast catalyst deactivation in the propane aromatization. The catalyst deactivation is attributed mainly to the coke formation on the zeolite. Earlier, a few studies have been reported on the deactivation of H-GaMFI zeolite in the propane aromatization. The catalyst deactivation is attributed mainly to the coke formation on the zeolite. Earlier, a few studies have been reported on the deactivation of H-GaMFI zeolite in the propane aromatization at 500-550{degrees}C for a short time-on-stream (10 h). It is interesting to know the effect of catalyst deactivation due to coking in the propane aromatization for much longer periods both at low (at 400{degrees}C) and high (at 550{degrees}C) temperatures on the product selectivity and also on the surface (viz., sorption capacity, acidity/acid strength distribution) and catalytic properties of the zeolite.

The catalytic activity in n-butane isomerization of these samples (at 300 {degrees}C, 1 atm, and WHSV = 2.5 h{sup -1}), previously activated in air at 620{degrees}C is not well correlated with their textural properties or the SO{sub 4}{sup 2-} concentration.

The catalytic activity decreases with the calcination temperature in a similar way as the OH groups (determined by chlorination) are eliminated, forming less reactive surface groups. When the crystalline samples are sulfated with H{sub 2}SO{sub 4} vapors, catalytically active materials are produced, irrespective of the crystalline state. The drastic sulfation overcomes the inertness of the crystalline surface and catalytic active sites for n-butane isomerization are produced.

For each of the reactor configurations considered, the overall methane to oxygen feed ratio was optimized such that the C{sub 2} yield at the reactor outlet was maximized. Modeling results showed that distributed feed oxygen could give rise to much higher C{sub 2} yields than the cofeed reactor, as long at the ratio of catalyst loading to initial methane flow rate was sufficiently high. Although reactors with optimally distributed oxygen feed give higher C{sub 2} yields than evenly distributed ones, the improvement is not significant. In the case of a two-membrane reactor, where one membrane is used for oxygen feed and the other for C{sub 2} product removal, higher C{sub 2} yields could be obtained than in a single membrane reactor with distributed oxygen feed. However, if the membrane for C{sub 2} product removal is also permeable to other species as well as to C{sub 2} products, low permeability of methane is critical to the achievement of high C{sub 2} yield.","","","","USDOE, Washington, DC (United States)","","United States","1997-03-01T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: Industrial and Engineering Chemistry Research; Journal Volume: 36; Journal Issue: 3; Other Information: PBD: Mar 1997","","Medium: X; Size: pp. 559-567","","","AC22-92PC92113","Journal ID: IECRED; ISSN 0888-5885; TRN: IM9717%%229","10.1021/ie9605185","","2009-12-16T00:00:00Z","458443","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/458443","","Industrial and Engineering Chemistry Research","3","36"

A two-step reaction sequence operated at two different temperatures was adopted to pass around the thermodynamic barrier of low-temperature methane conversion. Methane was first activated as a result of the dissociative deposition over a Ru catalyst, followed by rehydrogenation to form higher hydrocarbons. The use of the Pd-Ag membrane reactor significantly enhanced the methane conversion into hydrogen and carbonaceous species in the first step and the yield of higher hydrocarbons upon rehydrogenation in the second step. The repartition of different carbonaceous species was monitored by temperature-programmed surface reaction (TPSR). The effective methane conversion at low temperatures in the membrane reactor favored the formation of C{sub {alpha}} species which were selective to produce higher hydrocarbons. A C{sub 2+} yield of about 16% was obtained by conducting methane decomposition at 300 C and rehydrogenation at 100--120 C in the Pd-Ag membrane reactor.","","","","Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of Canada, Ottawa, ON (Canada)","","United States","1997-03-01T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: Industrial and Engineering Chemistry Research; Journal Volume: 36; Journal Issue: 3; Other Information: PBD: Mar 1997","","Medium: X; Size: pp. 553-558","","","","Journal ID: IECRED; ISSN 0888-5885; TRN: IM9717%%228","10.1021/ie960547f","","2009-12-16T00:00:00Z","458442","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/458442","","Industrial and Engineering Chemistry Research","3","36"

The present study on conversion of methane in dc corona discharge packed bed reactors may significantly improve the process economics. Experimental investigations have been conducted in which all the reactive gases pass through a catalyst bed which is situated within the corona-induced plasma zone. In this study, a typical OCM catalyst, Sr/La{sub 2}O{sub 3}, was used to investigate experimentally the corona discharge OCM reactions. Experiments were conducted over a wide range of temperatures (823--1,023 K) and input powers (0--6 W) with both positive and negative corona processes. Compared to the catalytic process in the absence of corona discharge, the corona discharge results in higher methane conversion and larger yield of C{sub 2} products even at temperatures at which there is no C{sub 2} activity for the catalyst alone. The methane conversion and C{sub 2} yield increase with O{sub 2} partial pressure during the corona-enhanced catalytic reactions, while the selectivity decreases slightly with increasing O{sub 2} partial pressure. Compared to results obtained in the absence of corona discharges, methane conversion in the presence of the dc corona was nearly five times larger and the selectivity for C{sub 2} over eight times higher at 853 K. A great enhancement in catalytic activity has also been achieved at a temperature at which the catalyst alone shows no C{sub 2} activity. The conversion at higher temperature (more than 953 K) is limited by the poor corona performance and the availability of active oxygen species.","","","","USDOE, Washington, DC (United States)","","United States","1997-03-01T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: Industrial and Engineering Chemistry Research; Journal Volume: 36; Journal Issue: 3; Other Information: PBD: Mar 1997","","Medium: X; Size: pp. 632-637","","","FG21-94MC31170","Journal ID: IECRED; ISSN 0888-5885; TRN: IM9717%%234","10.1021/ie960139b","","2009-12-16T00:00:00Z","458448","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/458448","","Industrial and Engineering Chemistry Research","3","36"

They showed that the predictions of multiple steady states for such infinite columns have relevant implications for columns of finite length operated at finite reflux. In this article, experiments are described for the ternary homogeneous system methanol-methyl butyrate-toluene which demonstrate the existence of multiple steady states (output multiplicities) caused by the vapor-liquid-equilibrium. The experiments on an industrial pilot column show two stable steady states for the same feed flow rate and composition and the same set of operating parameters. The measurements are in excellent agreement with the predictions obtained for infinite columns using the {infinity}/{infinity} analysis tool as well as with stage-by-stage simulation results.

The initial rates of isomerization of 2-methyl-1-butene to 2-methyl-2-butene and the etherification of 2-methyl-1-butene to TAME were measured in the absence of 2-methyl-2-butene in the feed. The initial rate of etherification was found to be 2.3--2.7 times that of isomerization. The experimental results were best described by kinetic equations, which were based on a mechanism where the alcohol and the ether adsorbed on the catalyst surface and the isoamylenes reacted from the bulk liquid phase. The kinetic equations were written in terms of activities, using the UNIQUAC method for activity coefficient calculation. The activation energy was determined to be 81.6 kJ/mol for the isomerization and 72.6 kJ/mol for the etherification of 2M1B to TAME and 94.1 kJ/mol for the etherification of 2M2B.

This was on a plant that was already running well above design capacity due to previously made process changes. A single controller was developed to cover an isobutane dehydrogenation (ID) unit and an MTBE reaction and fractionation plant with the intermediate isobutylene surge drum. The overall benefit is realized by a comprehensive constrained multivariable predictive controller that properly handles all sets of limits experienced by the complex, whether limited by the front-end ID or back-end MTBE units. The controller has 20 manipulated, 6 disturbance and 44 controlled variables, and covers widely varying dynamics with settling times ranging from twenty minutes to six hours. The controller executes each minute with a six hour time horizon. A unique achievement is intelligent surge drum level handling by the controller for higher average daily complex capacity as a whole. The ID unit often operates at simultaneous limits on reactor effluent compressor capacity, cold box temperature and hydrogen/hydrocarbon ratio, and the MTBE unit at impurity in butene column overhead as well as impurity in MTBE product.

In the gas phase considerable catalyst sintering occurs only in the presence of oxygen at 773 K due to extensive carbon burn-off, whereas in an aqueous phase platinum particle growth is limited upon oxidative treatment. A hydrogen treatment in aqueous phase at 363 K causes platinum particle growth, aggregate formation, and covering of metal sites. These phenomena become more important with increasing pH. Platinum particle growth and aggregate formation are attributed to platinum particle rather than platinum adatom mobility and is caused by the destruction of the oxygen-containing surface groups on the graphite support, which serve as anchorage sites for the platinum particles. Site covering is caused by products originating from the graphite support, which are formed as a result of the reductive treatments. When performing the aqueous phase oxidation of methyl {alpha}-D-glucopyranoside at 323 K and a pH of 9, catalyst modifications are small under oxidative conditions. Exposure of the catalyst for several hours to methyl {alpha}-D-glucopyranoside under the same conditions but in the absence of oxygen causes site covering. 50 refs., 9 figs., 1 tab.","","","","","","United States","1997-03-01T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: Journal of Catalysis; Journal Volume: 166; Journal Issue: 2; Other Information: PBD: Mar 1997","","Medium: X; Size: pp. 148-159","","","","Journal ID: JCTLA5; ISSN 0021-9517; CNN: Project 70103; TRN: 97:002241-0003","10.1006/jcat.1997.1489","","2009-12-16T00:00:00Z","478755","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/478755","","Journal of Catalysis","2","166"

The dissociation of carbon dioxide acts as an oxygen supplier, while the decomposition products of methane scavenge the oxygen from the catalyst. When an abundance of oxygen is present, pulsing of methane leads to the production of carbon dioxide.

The measured reaction rates were fitted to three kinetic models; homogeneous, Eley-Rideal type, and Langmuir-Hinshelwood type. Of these, the Langmuir-Hinshelwood type model described the experimental results best. This model is based on single-site adsorption of every component, with the surface reaction being the rate-limiting step. The activation energies for the formation of tert-amyl ethyl ether from 2-methyl-1-butene were 90 and from 2-methyl-2-butene 108 kJ/mol.

It is clear that a higher temperature operation (>100 C) is advantageous for the enhancement of methanol oxidation and a maximum enhancement by Ru adatoms at each operating temperature is obtained at Pt/Ru = 1/1. These results are quite similar to those obtained at low temperatures in 0.5 M H{sub 2}SO{sub 4}.

On the other hand, the reduction temperature had only a negligible effect on the overall and intrinsic activities. The decrease in rate at high calcination temperatures was caused by a decrease in the number of surface active sites due to a decrease in the reducibility of the catalyst.

The activity of the catalyst is consistent with its reduction performance, both of which have similar regularity change to phase composition ratios in the precursor. The easier the catalyst is reduced, the higher the activity.

It is found that there are four hydrogen consumption peaks representing four nickel species on Al{sub 2}O{sub 3}; the peak temperatures for three of them are below 673 K when the reduction temperature does not exceed to 973 K. For the methanation of both CO and CO{sub 2}, three distinct active phases are discovered, the activation temperatures of which coincide with the peak temperatures of the first three TPR peaks, respectively. This indicates that different oxidized nickel species exist on Al{sub 2}O{sub 3} prior to reduction and form different active phases for the methanation of both CO and CO{sub 2} after reduction. The methanation activities on each phase for both CO and CO{sub 2} in terms of CH{sub 4} yield or initial methanation temperature and turnover number differ significantly. Each phase also exhibits different activity for CO and CO{sub 2} methanation. It is suggested that the mechanism of methanation for CO or CO{sub 2} on different phases may vary, and that the mechanism for CO and CO{sub 2} on the same phase may also vary. CSRM is convenient for separating different active phases for the methanation of both CO and CO{sub 2} on Ni/Al{sub 2}O{sub 3} catalyst. 23 refs., 5 figs., 2 tabs.","","","","","","United States","1997-02-01T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: Journal of Catalysis; Journal Volume: 166; Journal Issue: 1; Other Information: PBD: Feb 1997","","Medium: X; Size: pp. 1-7","","","","Journal ID: JCTLA5; ISSN 0021-9517; TRN: 97:002649-0001","10.1006/jcat.1997.1449","","2009-12-16T00:00:00Z","518335","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/518335","","Journal of Catalysis","1","166"

To study the influence of particle concentration on the hydrodynamics of bubble-column slurry reactors operating in the heterogeneous flow regime, experiments were carried out in 0.10, 0.19, and 0.38-m-dia. columns using paraffinic oil as the liquid phase and slurry concentrations of up to 36 vol. %. To interpret experimental results a generalization of the two-phase model for gas-solid fluid beds was used to describe bubble hydrodynamics. The two phases identified are: a dilute phase consisting of fast-rising large bubbles that traverse the column virtually in plug flow and a dense phase that is identified with the liquid phase along with solid particles and entrained small bubbles. The dense phase suffers backmixing considerably. Dynamic gas disengagement was experimented in the heterogeneous flow regime to determine the gas voidage in dilute and dense phases. Experimental data show that increasing the solid concentration decreases the total gas holdup significantly, but the influence on the dilute-phase gas holdup is small. The dense-phase gas voidage significantly decreases gas holdup due to enhanced coalescence of small bubbles resulting from introduction of particles. The dense-phase gas voidage is practically independent of the column diameter. The dilute-phase gas holdup, on the other hand, decreases with increasing column diameter, and this dependence could be described adequately with a slight modification of the correlation of Krishna and Ellenberger developed for gas-liquid systems.","","","","","","United States","1997-02-01T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: AIChE Journal; Journal Volume: 43; Journal Issue: 2; Other Information: PBD: Feb 1997","","Medium: X; Size: pp. 311-316","","","","Journal ID: AICEAC; ISSN 0001-1541; TRN: IM9736%%97","10.1002/aic.690430204","","2009-12-16T00:00:00Z","511971","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/511971","","AIChE Journal","2","43"

Multiparameter optimization of reaction conditions using a Box-Benkhen experimental design shows that the highest yield and selectivity to 2,3-pentanedione are achieved at low temperature, elevated pressure, and long contact time, while yield and selectivity to acrylic acid are most favorable at high temperature, low pressure, and short contact time. Post-reaction Fourier transform infrared spectroscopic analyses of the catalyst indicate that sodium nitrate as the initial catalyst material is transformed to sodium lactate at the onset of reaction via proton transfer from lactic acid to nitrate.

Among many cathode electrocatalysts tested, H{sub 2}PtCl{sub 6} showed the highest selectivity and high activity for the formation of C{sub 2}H{sub 5}CHO. However, H{sub 2}PtCl{sub 6} did not catalyze the reaction at all under a gas mixture of C{sub 2}H{sub 4}, CO, and H{sub 2}. H{sub 2}PtCl{sub 6} was specifically active for the electrocatalytic hydroformylation by separating H{sub 2} from C{sub 2}H{sub 4} and CO with a H{sub 3}PO{sub 4}-electrolyte membrane. The addition of Na{sub 3}PO{sub 4} to the cathode enhanced the rate of C{sub 2}H{sub 5}CHO formation as well as the selectivity. The cell reaction does not require electrical energy input but takes place spontaneously and most efficiently under short-circuit conditions. The results from kinetic and electrochemical studies have suggested that the catalytic active species is the Pt{sup 2+}-chloride supported on the host graphite. A stronger coordination of CO compared to those of C{sub 2}H{sub 4} and hydride reduces both the hydrogenation and hydroformylation of C{sub 2}H{sub 4}. Therefore, a low partial pressure of CO and higher partial pressures of C{sub 2}H{sub 4} and H{sub 2} are recommended for the conversion of C{sub 2}H{sub 4}. The optimum temperature for the hydroformylation was 373 K. The results of transition response experiments have suggested a rapid reversible coordination of C{sub 2}H{sub 4} but a slow conversion of the precursor of C{sub 2}H{sub 5}CHO on Pt{sup 2+} the sites. A tentative reaction mechanism assuming the formations of ethyl-carbonyl, ethyl-carbonyl hydride and acyl-carbonyl Pt complexes has been proposed on the bases of the results in this work. 15 refs., 13 figs., 2 tabs.","","","","","","United States","1997-01-15T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: Journal of Catalysis; Journal Volume: 165; Journal Issue: 2; Other Information: PBD: 15 Jan 1997","","Medium: X; Size: pp. 221-230","","","","Journal ID: JCTLA5; ISSN 0021-9517; TRN: 97:001302-0010","10.1006/jcat.1997.1472","","2009-12-16T00:00:00Z","476806","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/476806","","Journal of Catalysis","2","165"

To investigate water adsorption and dissociation, the reaction between H{sub 2}O and D{sub 2} was studied. To investigate the formation and cleavage of C-O bonds on the nickel surface, transient CO methanation experiments were performed. Rate constants of surface elementary reactions were extracted from the data by fitting the measured response curves to microkinetic models. An overall model that describes the reactions of methane with steam and CO{sub 2} in microkinetic terms was constructed based on these rate constants and on previously published steam reforming and CO{sub 2} methanation data. The model suggests that there is no single rate-determining step in methane reforming with either steam or CO{sub 2}, and that under some conditions the availability of surface oxygen may play a key role in determining the rate. 63 refs., 10 figs., 3 tabs.","","","","","","United States","1997-01-15T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: Journal of Catalysis; Journal Volume: 165; Journal Issue: 2; Other Information: PBD: 15 Jan 1997","","Medium: X; Size: pp. 262-274","","","","Journal ID: JCTLA5; ISSN 0021-9517; TRN: 97:001302-0014","10.1006/jcat.1997.1468","","2009-12-16T00:00:00Z","476810","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/476810","","Journal of Catalysis","2","165"

It has been shown that selectivity to ethanol of up to 50% can be achieved with an alumina-supported Rh catalyst containing 2 wt% Rh and promoted by 10 wt% Fe. Characterization of the Fe-promoted Al{sub 2}O{sub 3}-supported Rh catalysts with increasing promoter loadings by selective chemisorption and temperature-programmed reduction (TPR) has provided evidence of a close interaction between the active metal and the promoter oxide especially at higher promoter loadings. The results obtained are consistent with the buildup of a close packed monolayer of the promoter oxide on the support surface which is possible due to the presence of a high surface density of hydroxyl groups on alumina. The influence of the metal precursor and the drying rate on the final metal salt distribution through the pore structure of a preshaped alumina support has also been investigated. It has been shown that impregnation of 1/16{close_quotes} {gamma}-alumina extrudates with an aqueous solution of iron nitrate causes the iron salt to be deposited at the outer edge of the pore structure. A more uniform distribution can be obtained if a methanolic solution of Fe(NO{sub 3}){sub 3} or an aqueous solution of an organometallic complex is used as the deposited metal precursor. 80 refs., 13 figs., 3 tabs.","","","","","","United States","1997-01-15T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: Journal of Catalysis; Journal Volume: 165; Journal Issue: 2; Other Information: PBD: 15 Jan 1997","","Medium: X; Size: pp. 249-261","","","","Journal ID: JCTLA5; ISSN 0021-9517; TRN: 97:001302-0013","10.1006/jcat.1997.1482","","2009-12-16T00:00:00Z","476809","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/476809","","Journal of Catalysis","2","165"

ZSM-5 was used as a support. Reaction products were analyzed using gas chromatography. Changes in the composition of catalyst samples were followed by X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy. Molybdenum metal and oxides interacted strongly with methane at 973 K to give H{sub 2} (MO) and H{sub 2}O and CO{sub 2} (oxides), but only a trace amount of ethane. When these compounds were contacted with ZSM-5, the reaction pathway of methane initially was the same. Afterward, however, a dramatic change occurred in the product distribution: the formation of ethane, ethylene, and benzene came into prominence. This was particularly the case when these compounds were highly dispersed on ZSM-5. The selectivity to benzene was 80-85%. XPS analysis of Mo-containing catalysts demonstrated the formation of MO carbides during the catalytic reaction. Unsupported MO carbides behaved like metallic MO; the dominant process was the decomposition of methane to hydrogen and carbon. The deposition of Mo{sub 2}C on ZSM-5 in a well-dispersed state, however, produced a very active and selective catalyst for the conversion of methane into benzene. The results suggest that Mo{sub 2}C is the active surface species in the Mo-containing catalysts, which converts methane into ethylene, the primary compound for the production of benzene on the zeolite surface. 28 refs., 9 figs., 2 tabs.","","","","","","United States","1997-01-15T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: Journal of Catalysis; Journal Volume: 165; Journal Issue: 2; Other Information: PBD: 15 Jan 1997","","Medium: X; Size: pp. 150-161","","","","Journal ID: JCTLA5; ISSN 0021-9517; TRN: 97:001302-0004","10.1006/jcat.1997.1478","","2009-12-16T00:00:00Z","476800","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/476800","","Journal of Catalysis","2","165"

The variables are the combustion temperature and pressure, fuel type, combustion zone residence time, mixture inlet temperature, reactor surface-to-volume ratio, and inlet jet size. The effects of these variables are examined by using jet-stirred reactors and chemical reactor modeling. The atmospheric pressure experiments have been completed and are fully reported. The results cover the combustion temperature range (measured) of 1,500 to 1,850 K, and include the following four fuels: methane, ethylene, propane, and carbon monoxide/hydrogen mixtures. The reactor residence time is varied from 1.7 to 7.4 ms, with most of the work done at 3.5 ms. The mixture inlet temperature is taken as 300 and 600 K, and two inlet jet sizes are used. Elevated pressure experiments are reported for pressures up to 7.1 atm for methane combustion at 4.0 ms with a mixture inlet temperature of 300 K. Experimental results are compared to chemical reactor modeling. This is accomplished by using a detailed chemical kinetic mechanism in a chemical reactor model, consisting of a perfectly stirred reactor (PSR) followed by a plug flow reactor (PFR). The methane results are also compared to several laboratory-scale and industrial-scale burners operated at simulated gas turbine engine conditions.","","","","USDOE","","United States","1997-01-01T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: Journal of Engineering for Gas Turbines and Power; Journal Volume: 119; Journal Issue: 1; Conference: 40.

On the basis of a kinetic analysis of limited results at 250 C, an earlier paper concluded that tert-butyl alcohol dissociates as an Arrhenius acid at 250 C and thereby catalyzes its own dehydration to isobutylene. Kinetic analyses of the data sets contained in this paper do not corroborate the alleged ability of tert-butyl alcohol to protonate water. Instead, the authors find that hydronium ions formed by the ordinary dissociation of water are the primary catalytic agents for the dehydration reaction. In agreement with the earlier work, all three data sets are consistent with a heterolytic reaction mechanism involving protonated alcohol, carbocation, di-tert-butyl ether, and protonated ether as intermediates. The kinetics still suggest that tert-butyl alcohol weakly dissociated as a Bronsted acid at these conditions. Values of K{sub w} determined by the kinetic model enjoy good agreement with electrochemical values available in the literature. Values of the other parameters (rate constants) which compose the kinetic model are evaluated with less precision, and a novel method is proposed to estimate the uncertainty associated with each parameter.","","","","National Science Foundation, Washington, DC (United States)","","United States","1997-01-01T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: Industrial and Engineering Chemistry Research; Journal Volume: 36; Journal Issue: 1; Other Information: PBD: Jan 1997","","Medium: X; Size: pp. 23-41","","","","Journal ID: IECRED; ISSN 0888-5885; TRN: IM9711%%401","10.1021/ie960349o","","2009-12-16T00:00:00Z","438937","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/438937","","Industrial and Engineering Chemistry Research","1","36"

Coke H/C ratio greatly affects its reactivity during combustion; consequently, a severe thermal equilibration treatment is recommended for reproducibility of results. Combustion kinetics of equilibrated coke, when it is released from the catalyst, has been proven to be similar to that of the coke deposited on other catalysts for several processes. Lower coke reactivity for aging and combustion, on being deposited within the HZSM5 zeolite, must be attributed to air-coke contact restrictions due to the location of the coke, which partially impedes the flow of air into the crystals.","","","","","","United States","1997-01-01T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: Industrial and Engineering Chemistry Research; Journal Volume: 36; Journal Issue: 1; Other Information: PBD: Jan 1997","","Medium: X; Size: pp. 60-66","","","","Journal ID: IECRED; ISSN 0888-5885; TRN: IM9711%%403","10.1021/ie9507336","","2009-12-16T00:00:00Z","438939","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/438939","","Industrial and Engineering Chemistry Research","1","36"
"The interaction of liquid reacting droplets with the pulsating flow in a Rijke-tube combustor","Carvalho, J A; Gotac, P R; McQuay, M Q","40 CHEMISTRY; 10 SYNTHETIC FUELS; COMBUSTORS; ALCOHOLS; FLUID MECHANICS; MATHEMATICAL MODELS; DROPLETS; EVAPORATION; LIQUID FUELS; PULSE TECHNIQUES","This paper presents the results of a theoretical investigation on the characteristics of a reacting liquid droplet in the self-generated oscillatory flow of a Rijke-pulse combustor. The droplet motion equation, accounting for droplet evaporation due to combustion, was solved using a fourth-order, Runge-Kutta method. The model was applied to a Rijke-type, alcohol-fired combustor for which experimental data exist to be used as entrance parameters. The main conclusions derived from this study are (1) for a range of droplet initial velocity, pulsating flames of liquid fuels are shorter than the corresponding steady flames because of a reduction in lifetime of droplets with the same initial diameter in the pulsating flow, (2) for a range of droplet initial diameter, time-resolved heat generation rates from pulsating sprays exhibit a preferred frequency equal to twice the frequency of the pulsating flow, and (3) droplet initial diameter, droplet initial velocity, and location of the spray in the tube influence the excitation and maintenance of acoustic oscillations in a Rijke-type combustor based on evaluation of the Rayleigh integral over time and volume in the combustor. The theoretical results presented and discussed herein are supported by experimental observations.","","","","","","United States","1997-01-01T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: Combustion and Flame; Journal Volume: 108; Journal Issue: 1-2; Other Information: PBD: Jan 1997","","Medium: X; Size: pp. 87-103","","","","Journal ID: CBFMAO; ISSN 0010-2180; TRN: IM9713%%346","10.1016/S0010-2180(96)00106-X","","2009-12-16T00:00:00Z","445609","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/445609","","Combustion and Flame","1-2","108"
"Analysis of fuel decay routes in the high-temperature oxidation of 1-methylnaphthalene","Shaddix, C R; Brezinsky, K; Glassman, I","40 CHEMISTRY; 10 SYNTHETIC FUELS; CONDENSED AROMATICS; COMBUSTION KINETICS; OXIDATION; DECOMPOSITION; REACTION INTERMEDIATES; FUEL-AIR RATIO","1-Methylnaphthalene exhibits first-order decay during early extents of oxidation in a flow reactor at approximately 1,200 K. Using temporal profiles of measured stable intermediate species and reaction path analysis, estimates are made of the radical species mole fractions that necessarily exist near steady state under these conditions. The radical estimates are found to be similar to previous estimations and computations of radical mole fractions in the flow reactor oxidation of toluene, the monocyclic aromatic analog of 1-methylnaphthalene. Computation of overall fuel decay rates using the estimated radical concentrations shows good agreement with the measured 1-methylnaphthalene consumption for all of the experimentally investigated stoichiometries, giving convincing evidence for the validity of the proposed consumption routes. Computed fuel decay path fluxes reveal that under flow reactor conditions abstraction of a benzylic hydrogen from the methyl side chain dominates consumption of 1-methylnaphthalene, although O atom addition to the aromatic ring, displacement of the side chain by H atom, and homolytic decay also contribute significantly. Changes in the 1-methylnaphthalene decay mechanism under higher temperature combustion environments and the oxidation mechanisms of even larger polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons are postulated.","","","","","","United States","1997-01-01T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: Combustion and Flame; Journal Volume: 108; Journal Issue: 1-2; Other Information: PBD: Jan 1997","","Medium: X; Size: pp. 139-157","","","","Journal ID: CBFMAO; ISSN 0010-2180; TRN: IM9713%%349","10.1016/S0010-2180(96)00054-5","","2009-12-16T00:00:00Z","445612","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/445612","","Combustion and Flame","1-2","108"

Infrared results confirm the presence of methoxide ions, and ESR spectra demonstrate that the reaction involves the reduction of V{sup 5+} to V{sup 4+}. The methoxide ions may either decompose to formaldehyde or react with water or surface protons to form methanol. In temperature-programmed reaction experiments, both methanol and formaldehyde reached a maximum concentration in the gas phase at 200- 250{degrees}C over V{sub 2}O{sub 5}, but over V{sub 2}O{sub 5}/SiO{sub 2}, the methanol and formaldehyde maxima were shifted to ca. 300 and 400{degrees}C, respectively. The production of CH{sub 3}OH at the lower temperature over V{sub 2}O{sub 5}/SiO{sub 2} suggests that methoxide ions may react with water or surface protons to form methanol more quickly than they decompose to formaldehyde. Nevertheless, in continuous flow experiments at 300 and 500{degrees}C, formaldehyde was the principal oxygenated product because of the rapid oxidation of CH{sub 3}OH at this temperature, and, in the case of pure V{sub 2}O{sub 5}, the direct conversion of methoxide ions to formaldehyde appears to compete favorably with their reaction with water. 20 refs., 5 figs., 5 tabs.","","","","","","United States","1997-01-01T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: Journal of Catalysis; Journal Volume: 165; Journal Issue: 1; Other Information: PBD: 1 Jan 1997","","Medium: X; Size: pp. 73-79","","","","Journal ID: JCTLA5; ISSN 0021-9517; TRN: 97:001303-0006","10.1006/jcat.1997.1448","","2009-12-16T00:00:00Z","476839","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/476839","","Journal of Catalysis","1","165"

Partial oxidation of methane by oxygen formed formaldehyde most selectively over the V{sub 2}O{sub 5}/SiO{sub 2} catalyst, but catalytic performance strongly dependent on vanadia coverage and autocatalytic behavior was observed. At very low conversions, the formaldehyde activity increased linearly with vanadia coverage, indicating that isolated V{sub 5}, species were responsible for the active sites. No significant structural changes were revealed by in situ Raman spectroscopy for the V{sub 2}O{sub 5}/SiO{sub 2} catalyst, which indicated that the fully oxidized surface sites were related to the high formaldehyde selectivity. This selectivity exhibited a maximum at 1 wt% V{sub 2}O{sub 5} content, and the lower selectivities at higher loadings appeared to be due to the increasing Lewis acidity of the catalysts. Space-time yields of 0.1-1.4 kg CH{sub 2}O/kg cat/hr and selectivities of 2-78% are reported herein for the V{sub 2}O{sub 5}/SiO{sub 2} catalysts. Deep oxidation products, CO and CO{sub 2}, were principally produced over the V{sub 2}O{sub 5}/TiO{sub 2} and V{sub 2}O{sub 5}/SnO{sub 2} catalysts. For the first time, in situ Raman analysis clearly showed that for these latter catalysts the surface vanadium(V) oxide species were partially reduced under the steady-state reaction conditions. The performance of the V{sub 2}O{sub 5}/TiO{sub 2}/SiO{sub 2} catalyst was similar to that of the V{sub 2}O{sub 5}/TiO{sub 2} catalyst, consistent with the earlier observation that vanadia was largely bound to the titania overlayer. It appears that formaldehyde selectivity decreased with increasing catalyst reducibility, but no direct correlation of catalyst activity with reducibility was observed. 36 refs., 12 figs., 2 tabs.","","","","","","United States","1997-01-01T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: Journal of Catalysis; Journal Volume: 165; Journal Issue: 1; Other Information: PBD: 1 Jan 1997","","Medium: X; Size: pp. 91-101","","","FG21-92MC29228","Journal ID: JCTLA5; ISSN 0021-9517; CNN: Grant CTS-9417981; TRN: 97:001303-0007","10.1006/jcat.1997.1446","","2009-12-16T00:00:00Z","476840","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/476840","","Journal of Catalysis","1","165"

Two Holocene resins originating from Santander, Colombia and Mombasa, Kenya were analyzed. Soluble polymers were isolated by extraction with a 1:1 (v/v) methylene chloride-methanol mixture following sequential extractions with methylene chloride and methanol. The molecular weight of polymer extracts was shown by GPC analyses to exceed that of non-polymeric occluded terpenoids. Py-GC-MS, solid-state {sup 13}C CP/MAS and {sup 13}C cross-polarization/depolarization NMR spectroscopy results indicated that chemical compositions of soluble polymers isolated from immature resins are highly representative of the structure of corresponding insoluble polymers, i.e. polylabdatrienes. These data provide evidence for cross-linking or cyclization of side-chain olefinic carbons during or shortly after polymerization. Generally, the characterization of soluble resin polymers by liquid-state NMR spectroscopy has proven to be an excellent means for investigating the maturation mechanism of polylabdanoid resinites, and has potential for furthering the application of Class I resinites as geothermal indicators.","","","Argonne National Lab.

Compared to those under normal gravity (1-g) conditions, the elimination of buoyancy-induced flows is expected to significantly change the flow field in microgravity (0 g) flames, resulting in taller and wider flames with longer particle residence times. Work by Bahadori and Edelman demonstrate many previously unreported qualitative and semi-quantitative results, including flame shape and radiation, for sooting laminar gas jet diffusion flames. Work by Ku et al. report soot aggregate size and morphology analyses, and data and model predictions of soot volume fraction maps for various gas jet diffusion flames.

Economic initiatives and policies include creating sustainable economic development regions through the use of tax incentives and tax penalties. The technologies and economies are brought together by social concepts such as Technopolis and the theory of self-organizing and self-energizing social systems, i.e. creating wealth where there was none through sweat equity. Existing organizational structures such as credit unions, kibbutz`s and agricultural and marketing cooperatives provide methods by which global marco-projects can be implemented on a local level.

While methanol synthesis from syngas is a well established process, the work on higher alcohol synthesis has been less successful. The demand for MTBE (Methyl-tert-butylether) is shifting the interest from higher linear alcohols towards the branched members, mainly isobutanol. The application of slurry reactors for exothermic reactions has gained considerable interest in the industrial and academic world. For synthesis gas conversions the LPMeOH process by Air Products is a well known example. This prompted us to apply this technology to isobutanol synthesis which runs under more extreme reaction conditions. Because of much easier and faster handling and the necessity to compare results from slurry reactions with the fixed bed reactions cited in literature fixed bed reactor systems are preferred for catalyst development and optimization. The main differences e.g. temperature gradients, backmixing and particle sizes will obviously have major influence on a reaction which mechanistically consists of a network from parallel and consecutive steps. Due to this objective, a fixed bed reactor study has been performed running a typical isobutanol catalyst with different particle sizes and linear velocities. The catalyst developed by us consists of a potassium promoted ZrO{sub 2}/ZnO/MnO possessing high activity for isobutanol and methanol. These tests provide data to study the behaviour of residence time and temperature on reaction products. Furthermore mass transfer limitations which affect activity and selectivity can be determined.","","","","","","United States","1996-12-31T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: Preprints of Papers, American Chemical Society, Division of Fuel Chemistry; Journal Volume: 41; Journal Issue: 3; Conference: 212. national meeting of the American Chemical Society (ACS), Orlando, FL (United States), 25-30 Aug 1996; Other Information: PBD: 1996","","Medium: X; Size: pp. 875-879","","CONF-960807-","","Journal ID: ACFPAI; ISSN 0569-3772; TRN: 97:000002-0024","","","2009-12-16T00:00:00Z","420523","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/420523","","Preprints of Papers, American Chemical Society, Division of Fuel Chemistry","3","41"

With proper MO{sub x} modification enhanced reducibility of vanadia could be attained, which in turn makes the partial oxidation more facile.","","","","","","United States","1996-12-31T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: Preprints of Papers, American Chemical Society, Division of Fuel Chemistry; Journal Volume: 41; Journal Issue: 4; Conference: 212. national meeting of the American Chemical Society (ACS), Orlando, FL (United States), 25-30 Aug 1996; Other Information: PBD: 1996","","Medium: X; Size: pp. 1170-1173","","CONF-960807-","","Journal ID: ACFPAI; ISSN 0569-3772; TRN: 97:000003-0008","","","2009-12-16T00:00:00Z","430329","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/430329","","Preprints of Papers, American Chemical Society, Division of Fuel Chemistry","4","41"

Catalytic hydrogenation of CO{sub 2} to produce various kinds of chemicals and fuels has received much attention as one of the most promising mitigation options. In particular, methanol synthesis by CO{sub 2} hydrogenation has been considered to play an important role in the transportation of hydrogen energy produced from natural energy such as solar energy, hydropower and so on. According to some estimations, an electric power of 300 MWh could be obtained from a methanol fired power plant in Japan, if methanol synthesized from CO{sub 2} and H{sub 2} produced by a electrolysis of water using an electric power of 1000 MWh is transported to Japan through the system. A practical methanol synthesis process greatly requires a high performance catalyst, which must be highly active and selective for methanol synthesis and also stable for a long period in a continuous operation. NIRE and RITE have been doing a joint research on methanol synthesis by catalytic hydrogenation of carbon dioxide. The authors have elucidated the role of metal oxides contained in Cu/ZnO-based ternary catalysts, and then developed Cu/ZnO-based multicomponent catalysts containing two or three metal oxides. Furthermore, we have examined the change in the activity of the multicomponent catalysts during a long term methanol synthesis test, and investigated the methanol synthesis over the multicomponcnt catalysts by using a reactor with a recycling equipment for unreacted gases.","","","","","","United States","1996-12-31T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: Preprints of Papers, American Chemical Society, Division of Fuel Chemistry; Journal Volume: 41; Journal Issue: 4; Conference: 212. national meeting of the American Chemical Society (ACS), Orlando, FL (United States), 25-30 Aug 1996; Other Information: PBD: 1996","","Medium: X; Size: pp. 1407-1410","","CONF-960807-","","Journal ID: ACFPAI; ISSN 0569-3772; TRN: 97:000003-0051","","","2009-12-16T00:00:00Z","430372","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/430372","","Preprints of Papers, American Chemical Society, Division of Fuel Chemistry","4","41"

In spite of this the industrial use of carbon dioxide as a source of chemical carbon is presently limited to preparation of urea and certain carboxylic acids as well as organic carbonates and polycarbonates. However, the situation is expected to change in the future, if effective catalytic systems allowing to activate carbon dioxide will become available. In this connection, the electrochemical reduction of CO{sub 2}, requiring only an additional input of water and electrical energy, appears as an attractive possibility. For more than 100 years formic acid and formates of alkali metals were considered as the only significant products of the electroreduction of carbon dioxide in aqueous solutions. The highest current efficiencies, exceeding 90 %, were obtained either with mercury or with amalgam electrodes. The only comprehensive study regarding kinetics of CO{sub 2} reduction in aqueous solution has been performed by Eyring et al. using a mercury cathode. This paper describes electrolysis studies.","","","","","","United States","1996-12-31T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: Preprints of Papers, American Chemical Society, Division of Fuel Chemistry; Journal Volume: 41; Journal Issue: 4; Conference: 212. national meeting of the American Chemical Society (ACS), Orlando, FL (United States), 25-30 Aug 1996; Other Information: PBD: 1996","","Medium: X; Size: pp. 1420-1424","","CONF-960807-","","Journal ID: ACFPAI; ISSN 0569-3772; TRN: 97:000003-0054","","","2009-12-16T00:00:00Z","430375","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/430375","","Preprints of Papers, American Chemical Society, Division of Fuel Chemistry","4","41"

Gas discharge (glow, corona, arc and silence discharges) is an abundant resource of free radicals. The potential to develop a technique, in which oxidative synthesize of high-valued hydrocarbons together with removal of CO{sub 2}, NO{sub x} and SO{sub x} is very economically attractive. The by-product of such a technique is carbon monoxide, which can be also applied for organic synthesis, e.g., F-T synthesis.

Likewise, there are numerous types of bacteria that are capable of extremely efficient CO{sub 2} fixation, including those that use light-driven processes, as well as several species that are capable of using the energy obtained from chemical oxidations to fuel CO{sub 2} reduction in the dark. However, nowhere in nature can an organism be found that has coupled CO{sub 2} fixation to significant ethanol production. With the realization that fully one-third of the corn starch used for biological ethanol formation is lost through the production of CO{sub 2} gas, it would be desirable to discover some way to use this CO{sub 2} for the production of value-added chemicals or other products of interest.

F-T (Fischer-Tropsch) reaction is a representative example. It is well known that the Schulz-Anderson-Flory law determines the distribution of hydrocarbons in F-T reaction. To overcome this limitation, the composite catalysts comprised of Fe-based catalyst and zeolite have been examined. Although these composite catalysts produced branched hydrocarbons and improved the selectivity of hydrocarbons, the distribution was essentially restricted by the Schulz-Anderson-Flory law in almost cases. We have already reported that hydrocarbons were obtained efficiently from carbon dioxide and hydrogen over another type of the composite catalysts which are prepared by the physical mixing of Cu-based catalysts and zeolite. This catalytic system combining methanol synthesis and MTG (Methanol-to-Gasoline) reaction presents a novel method for hydrocarbon synthesis which is free from the Schulz-Anderson-Flory law. We recently found that, in the hydrogenation of carbon dioxide, Fe-ZnO/HY composite catalyst produced hydrocarbons with a similar distribution to the composite catalysts comprised of Cu-Zn-chromate and zeolite, while Fe-ZnO catalyst acted as a typical F-T catalyst to afford hydrocarbons with the Schulz-Anderson-Flory distribution.

Special emphasis was devoted to the influence of the isotope exchange (scrambling) of reactants and products, especially O{sub 2} and CO{sub 2}, with the catalyst on the quantity of {sup 18}O-containing reaction products. Substantial amounts of H{sub 2}{sup 18}O and C{sup 18}O{sup 16}O were detected during pulses of a reactant mixture consisting of methane and {sup 16}O{sub 2} in a ratio 1:4 at 300 and 500{degree}C. The effect of the oxygen exchange of molecular oxygen with the solid phase proved to be negligible due to its low extent. At 300{degree}C, at least 20% of the CO{sub 2} formed originated from the redox mechanism involving lattice oxygen. At 500{degree}C, oxygen exchange of CO{sub 2} with the catalyst became predominant and precluded determining reliably the proportion of CO{sub 2} formed by the redox process. The results indicate that a substantial part of methane is oxidized via a redox process. Consequently, this reaction has to be taken into account when interpreting the catalytic behavior of palladium-based catalysts and explaining the structure-activity relations previously observed. 66 refs., 9 figs., 2 tabs.","","","","","","United States","1996-12-19T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: Journal of Physical Chemistry; Journal Volume: 100; Journal Issue: 51; Other Information: PBD: 19 Dec 1996","","Medium: X; Size: pp. 20006-20014","","","","Journal ID: JPCHAX; ISSN 0022-3654; TRN: 97:002377-009","10.1021/jp961903a","","2009-12-16T00:00:00Z","458663","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/458663","","Journal of Physical Chemistry","51","100"

Infrared spectroelectrochemistry allowed the identification of the carbon dioxide reduction products and provided information about the mechanism(s) of the reduction. Biocarbonate and formate were identified as the electrocatalytic carbon dioxide reaction products by comparing the infrared bands observed by spectroelectrochemistry with authentic samples of tetrabutylammonium oxalate, and tetrabutylammonium bicarbonate. Formate arises from a net two-electron reduction of carbon dioxide that produces free formate and a formate complex of [Ir{sub 2}(dimen){sub 4}]{sup 2+}.

"Prediction of vapor-liquid equilibria of associating mixtures with UNIFAC models that include association","Fu, Y H; Orbey, H; Sandler, S I","10 SYNTHETIC FUELS; 40 CHEMISTRY; MIXTURES; THERMODYNAMIC PROPERTIES; ALCOHOLS; ALKANES; EQUILIBRIUM; MATHEMATICAL MODELS; U CODES","Two UNIFAC association models are developed using Wertheim`s theory of association rather than a chemical theory. In both models the activity coefficient is the sum of combinatorial, residual, and association contributions. The UNIFAC group-contribution model is used for the combinatorial and residual terms, and two different types of association models are considered. The UNIFAC-AG model uses functional-group-based association, while the UNIFAC-AM model considers association to occur between molecules. For associating mixtures containing acids, alcohols, or water, both activity coefficient models provide better predictions of binary vapor-liquid equilibria than the original UNIFAC model. Of those models, the UNIFAC-AM model led to the best predictions. The association term was also added to the more recent, modified UNIFAC model and briefly tested with vapor-liquid equilibrium data for the acetic acid + heptane and acetic acid + butanol mixtures. It was found that, for vapor-liquid equilibria, the modified UNIFAC + association model is only slightly better than the UNIFAC-AM model. However, the modified UNIFAC + association model has four more adjustable parameters than the UNIFAC-AM model. Therefore, use of the UNIFAC-AG or UNIFAC-AM models is recommended.","","","","USDOE, Washington, DC (United States); National Science Foundation, Washington, DC (United States)","","United States","1996-12-01T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: Industrial and Engineering Chemistry Research; Journal Volume: 35; Journal Issue: 12; Other Information: PBD: Dec 1996","","Medium: X; Size: pp. 4656-4666","","","FG02-85ER13436","Journal ID: IECRED; ISSN 0888-5885; TRN: IM9706%%399","10.1021/ie950545f","","2009-12-16T00:00:00Z","419855","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/419855","","Industrial and Engineering Chemistry Research","12","35"

Multicomponent solubility data in the reacting system are therefore needed to ascertain whether it is due to condensation of the reactants, oxygen and cyclohexane, or the products, cyclohexanone, cyclohexanol, and water. In the present work, solubility measurements have been made for cyclohexanone and cyclohexanol in supercritical CO{sub 2} at 410, 423, and 433 K and in N{sub 2} at 423 K (N{sub 2} is taken as a homomorph for oxygen to avoid reaction). Solubility data have been measured in SC CO{sub 2} at 423 K for each of the three binary mixtures, (i) cyclohexane-cyclohexanone, (ii) cyclohexane-cyclohexanol, and (iii) cyclohexanone-cyclohexanol, at 170 and 205 bar. These data have been utilized to regress for each binary pair two adjustable parameters in the Peng-Robinson (P-R) EOS for predicting the multicomponent solubility data in a SC mixture of CO{sub 2} and O{sub 2} in the proportion of 8:1. It was concluded that the solubility of water is suppressed in the presence of other organic products and would be the first to condense out of the reaction mixture.","","","","","","United States","1996-12-01T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: Industrial and Engineering Chemistry Research; Journal Volume: 35; Journal Issue: 12; Other Information: PBD: Dec 1996","","Medium: X; Size: pp. 4713-4717","","","","Journal ID: IECRED; ISSN 0888-5885; TRN: IM9706%%401","10.1021/ie9601155","","2009-12-16T00:00:00Z","419857","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/419857","","Industrial and Engineering Chemistry Research","12","35"

The influence of electrostatic forces due to the dipole moment has been investigated, and a simple treatment of the polarizability has been tested. It is shown by comparison with some sample calculations based on the renormalized perturbation theory that this approach is reasonable.

Non-steady-state and steady-state isotopic transient experiments combined with in situ DRIFT spectroscopy investigations were used to quantify the amount of the various adspecies present on the working catalyst surface. It was found that as soon as the catalyst is contacted with the reacting mixture, dehydrogenated carbon adspecies originating from the initial adsorption of methane and carbon dioxide are deposited on the nickel particles. Under steady-state reaction conditions, a permanent pool of adspecies equivalent to one monolayer of carbide-like species is continuously fed by the dissociative activation of gaseous methane. This initial activation step of methane is shown to be reversible, since it allows a fast CH{sub 4}/CD{sub 4} exchange characterised by a marked isotopic effect. This pool of adspecies constitutes a reservoir of active carbon able to be oxidised into CO by oxygen atoms arising from the simultaneous carbon dioxide dissociation. This oxidation step which does not involve any C-H bond activation is assumed to be rate limiting since no kinetic isotopic effect is found for the formation of CO under the stoichiometric reforming conditions. Gaseous CO is also directly produced from the latter CO{sub 2} dissociation. Adsorption/desorption equilibria ensure a fast interconversion between gaseous CO{sub 2} and CO, as attested by their isotopic scrambling. A similar adsorption/desorption equilibrium is proposed for H{sub 2}O which, combined with the reversible activation of CO{sub 2} and CO, leads to the achieved water-gas-shift equilibrium. A particular configuration of active sites is proposed on the basis of the main mechanistic statements. 22 refs., 8 figs., 6 tabs.","","","","","","United States","1996-12-01T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: Journal of Catalysis; Journal Volume: 164; Journal Issue: 2; Other Information: PBD: Dec 1996","","Medium: X; Size: pp. 387-398","","","","Journal ID: JCTLA5; ISSN 0021-9517; TRN: 97:000965-0013","10.1006/jcat.1996.0395","","2009-12-16T00:00:00Z","468690","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/468690","","Journal of Catalysis","2","164"

The reactions proceed without application of pressurized conditions, just upon coadsorption of CO and alcohols or CO, H{sub 2}O, and olefins on zeolite. The observed Koch reaction under mild conditions provides strong evidence for the formation of alkyl carbenium ions from alcohols and olefins on the zeolites as crucial reaction intermediates. Of the family of carbenium ions, CO reacts selectively with tertiary cations to produce tertiary carboxylic acids, unless the carbonylated molecule is too large for more bulky tertiary moieties to be accommodated and carbonylated in the narrow pores of H-ZSM05. Thus, t-BuOH, i-BuOH, and isobutene produce trimethylacetic acid with high selectivity and conversion, while ethene transforms selectively into 2-methyl-2-ethyl butyric acid. Reaction of octene-1 molecules with CO and H{sub 2}O results in acids of the C{sub 8}H{sub 17}COOH and C{sub 16}H{sub 33}COOH families with predominantly linear hydrocarbon chains. The data obtained may open up new possibilities in using solid acids in organic synthesis as carbonylation catalysts under mild conditions i.e., low temperature and normal atmospheric pressure. 55 refs., 8 figs.","","","","","","United States","1996-12-01T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: Journal of Catalysis; Journal Volume: 164; Journal Issue: 2; Other Information: PBD: Dec 1996","","Medium: X; Size: pp. 411-421","","","","Journal ID: JCTLA5; ISSN 0021-9517; CNN: Grant RB 8000;Grant RB 8300;Grant 95-03-08780; TRN: 97:000965-0015","10.1006/jcat.1996.0397","","2009-12-16T00:00:00Z","468692","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/468692","","Journal of Catalysis","2","164"

The salts with a cation content of 2.5 {le}x{le}3, and that of Cs{sup +} with x=2, showed a much higher surface area than the parent acid, which is partially due to the formation of micropores. The micropores presented a fairly homogeneous distribution, with an average diameter in the range of 6-11 {Angstrom}, depending on the type of cation and cation content. The activity of the heteropoly acid and their monovalent type B salts for isobutane alkylation could be correlated with the surface acidity of the solids.

Two different types of developmental membranes were investigated: microporous silica-based membranes and a palladium thin film supported by a porous ceramic substrate. The membrane reactors were operated at liquid hourly space velocities (LHSVs) similar to those used in commercial reactors for propane dehydrogenation. Although the initial hydrogen permselectivity of the palladium membrane was substantially higher than that of the silica-based membranes, this membrane deactivated and eventually failed after several hours of exposure to reaction conditions. Moderate improvements in propylene yield were obtained with the silica-based membrane reactors. A propylene yield of 39.6% was obtained at an LHSV of 3 and a temperature of 823 K compared to a yield of 29.6% in a conventional packed-bed reactor operated with the same flow rate. The reaction selectivity for propylene was generally above 97 mol% in both the conventional and membrane reactors, however, catalyst deactivation rates were generally higher in the membrane reactors.","","","Sandia National Laboratories (SNL), Albuquerque, NM, and Livermore, CA (United States)","","","United States","1996-12-01T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: Industrial and Engineering Chemistry Research; Journal Volume: 35; Journal Issue: 12; Other Information: PBD: Dec 1996","","Medium: X; Size: pp. 4398-4405","","","AC04-94AL85000","Journal ID: IECRED; ISSN 0888-5885; TRN: IM9706%%380","10.1021/ie960133m","","2010-02-18T00:00:00Z","419836","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/419836","","Industrial and Engineering Chemistry Research","12","35"

Reaction parameters for these elementary steps were obtained from surface science and catalysis literature or fit to previously reported experimental data. The model agrees with the experimental data remarkably well, mimicking the selectivity and conversion trends observed experimentally with changing operating conditions. The model shows that a purely heterogeneous mechanism can be used to simulate the experimental results collected near atmospheric pressure accurately, suggesting that the mechanism the authors propose is sufficiently accurate to capture the main features of this reaction system. This model can also be used to examine this reaction system under conditions experimentally inaccessible. Application of this predictive ability to operation of this type of reactor under probable industrial conditions suggests that excellent ethylene yields are possible.","","","","National Science Foundation, Washington, DC (United States)","","United States","1996-12-01T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: AIChE Journal; Journal Volume: 42; Journal Issue: 12; Other Information: PBD: Dec 1996","","Medium: X; Size: pp. 3484-3489","","","","Journal ID: AICEAC; ISSN 0001-1541; TRN: IM9706%%432","10.1002/aic.690421218","","2009-12-16T00:00:00Z","419888","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/419888","","AIChE Journal","12","42"

In adsorption kinetics and adsorption equilibrium studies, the effects of particle size, temperature and, amount of zeolite on the uptake rate have been investigated. The breakthrough curves for four different flow rates of ethanol and three different bed heights were determined in dynamic column studies. The results of the experiments show that intraparticle diffusion is the main resistance. The local clinoptilolite is a promising adsorbent for water adsorption from aqueous ethanol.","","","","USDOE","","United States","1996-12-01T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: Separation Science and Technology; Journal Volume: 31; Journal Issue: 20; Other Information: PBD: Dec 1996","","Medium: X; Size: pp. 2855-2865","","","","Journal ID: SSTEDS; ISSN 0149-6395; TRN: 97:000805-0004","10.1080/01496399608000832","","2016-04-26T00:00:00Z","494260","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/494260","","Separation Science and Technology","20","31"

Phase 2 of the retrofit was the addition of a reforming exchanger system to reform natural gas feed. This unit uses process heat to eliminate the fired, primary reformer. The combination of the two technologies increases energy efficiency by recovering heat at a much higher temperature.

At temperatures in excess of 553 K, the conversion of cyclohexane over {gamma}-alumina supported and unsupported MOVS catalysts and a commercial MoO{sub 3}/Al{sub 2}O{sub 3} sample yielded cyclohexene, benzene, carbon monoxide, and carbon dioxide as the only detected products. The unsupported MOVS sample behaves as an active heterogeneous catalyst but the specific activities are increased by a factor of up to 8 upon supporting the precursor on alumina. The supported MOVS system also exhibits appreciable higher activity than the commercial catalyst and this is attributed to the unique dual dioxo-molybdenum sites present in the active MOVS catalyst. The oxidative dehydrogenation of cyclohexane is viewed as occurring in a stepwise fashion with cyclohexene appearing in the product mixture and the generation of carbon oxides occurring principally from the direct combustion of cyclohexane. Oxygen consumption, specific activities, and molar selectivities for the conversion of both reactants in the overall temperature range 488 K {le}T{le}673 K over the three molybdena systems are provided.

Therefore, separate vapor-liquid-liquid equilibrium measurements were performed on this system to more precisely determine the miscibility limits and the composition of the vapor phase in equilibrium with the two liquid phases.","","","","","","United States","1996-11-01T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: Journal of Chemical and Engineering Data; Journal Volume: 41; Journal Issue: 6; Other Information: PBD: Nov-Dec 1996","","Medium: X; Size: pp. 1239-1251","","","FC22-83FE60149","Journal ID: JCEAAX; ISSN 0021-9568; TRN: IM9653%%111","10.1021/je9601624","","2009-12-16T00:00:00Z","404509","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/404509","","Journal of Chemical and Engineering Data","6","41"

The active sites were located inside the gel phase of the resin, represented by microspheres, and on the macropores walls. The overall efficiency of such heterogeneous catalyst particles was defined by the macroeffectiveness and microeffectiveness factors accounting for the process behavior on the macropores and inside the microspheres. The synthesis of methyl tert-butyl ether, MTBE, a liquid-phase reversible exothermic reaction between methanol and isobutene, was considered as a reference case. This system was studied in the temperature range of 313--338 K, and the effect of the thermodynamic equilibrium conditions was examined. The results predicted by the complete heterogeneous model were compared with those obtained with the simple pseudohomogeneous model, which revealed higher hot spots. Moreover, a comparison between bidimensional and unidimensional models was also performed. The orthogonal collocation method was used for the discretization of the differential equations inside the catalyst particles, which were reduced from three (corresponding to the three mass balances for the three compounds, isobutene, methanol, and MTBE) to only one differential equation, by using the concept of the generalized variable.","","","","","","United States","1996-11-01T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: Industrial and Engineering Chemistry Research; Journal Volume: 35; Journal Issue: 11; Other Information: PBD: Nov 1996","","Medium: X; Size: pp. 3827-3841","","","","Journal ID: IECRED; ISSN 0888-5885; TRN: IM9653%%139","10.1021/ie9602421","","2016-04-08T00:00:00Z","404537","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/404537","","Industrial and Engineering Chemistry Research","11","35"

It is well-known that this reaction is accompanied by a rapid deactivation of the catalyst. The objective of this study is to elucidate the route to catalyst deactivation so that the means of mitigating this problem can be identified. Using the initial reaction rate data, evidence has been found for a Broensted acid mechanism. Under liquid-phase conditions, the reaction has been found to be severely diffusion limited. Using a kinetic model that accounts for the effect of diffusion, it was found that alkylation over this catalyst suffers from slow hydride transfer relative to olefin addition. This gives rise to a rapid formation of C{sub 12}{sup +} carbocations. The formation of these cations has been tied to catalyst deactivation, using a mathematical model for the reaction. On the basis of the insight gained from the experiments and modeling work, optimal reactor and catalyst design issues are examined. It is inferred from the reaction mechanism and confirmed experimentally that alkylation under pulsed flow conditions yields higher trimethylpentane/dimethylhexane ratios and slower rates of deactivation. It is suggested that the cause of the slow rate of hydride transfer is steric hindrance. Strategies for relieving this steric hindrance are proposed.","","","","","","United States","1996-11-01T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: Industrial and Engineering Chemistry Research; Journal Volume: 35; Journal Issue: 11; Other Information: PBD: Nov 1996","","Medium: X; Size: pp. 3861-3873","","","","Journal ID: IECRED; ISSN 0888-5885; TRN: IM9653%%143","10.1021/ie960172y","","2009-12-16T00:00:00Z","404541","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/404541","","Industrial and Engineering Chemistry Research","11","35"

The catalyst is characterized by XRD, XPS, and temperature-programmed reduction (TPR). The catalyst showed high activity/selectivity in both the steam and CO{sub 2} reforming reactions and the simultaneous steam and CO{sub 2} reforming. In the CO{sup 2} reforming, the coke deposition on the catalyst is found to be very fast. However, when the CO{sub 2} reforming is carried out simultaneously with the steam reforming, the coke deposition on the catalyst is drastically reduced. By the simultaneous CO{sub 2} and steam reforming (at {ge} 800 C and space velocity of about 20,000--30,000 cm{sup 3}/g{center_dot}h)m methane can be converted almost completely to syngas with 100% selectivity for both CO and H{sub 2}. The H{sub 2}/CO ratio in products can be varied between 1.5 and 2.5 quite conveniently by manipulating the relative concentration of steam and CO{sub 2} in the feed.","","","","","","United States","1996-11-01T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: Industrial and Engineering Chemistry Research; Journal Volume: 35; Journal Issue: 11; Other Information: PBD: Nov 1996","","Medium: X; Size: pp. 3934-3939","","","","Journal ID: IECRED; ISSN 0888-5885; TRN: IM9653%%150","10.1021/ie960002l","","2009-12-16T00:00:00Z","404548","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/404548","","Industrial and Engineering Chemistry Research","11","35"

The radiant flux can be significantly attenuated by core hydrocarbon gases that have absorption features in the infrared. The spectral absorptance of the {upsilon}{sub 3} (centered at approximately 3020 cm{sup -1}) and {upsilon}{sub 4} (centered at approximately 1306 cm{sup -1}) fundamental bands of methane were measured at elevated temperatures. The measurements were made using a FTIR spectrometer coupled to a gas cell that was maintained at a constant temperature in a furnace. The partial pressure of the methane was varied between 5 and 95 percent, yielding pressure path lengths between 1.14 and 21.74 atm-cm. The total pressure was maintained at 1 atm. Measurements were made at temperatures between 296 and 900 K. The effect of spectral resolution on the measurements and derived parameters was examined. Spectral resolutions between 4 and 32 cm{sup -1} were used. The spectral mean parameters of line strength and line shape were determined for the Elsasser narrow band radiation model using the data taken at a resolution of 4 cm{sup -1}. The band model parameters were incorporated into RADCAL, a narrow band model used to predict spectral intensity and transmittance. 13 refs., 10 figs., 1 tab.","","","","USDOE","","United States","1996-11-01T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: Journal of Heat Transfer; Journal Volume: 118; Journal Issue: 4; Other Information: PBD: Nov 1996","","Medium: X; Size: pp. 918-923","","","","Journal ID: JHTRAO; ISSN 0022-1481; CNN: Grant NIST 60NANB3D1436; TRN: 97:001726-036","10.1115/1.2822589","","2016-04-28T00:00:00Z","447245","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/447245","","Journal of Heat Transfer","4","118"

On cathodic polarization, the ring structures of PAn transformed from quinoid to benzenoid states. It was confirmed that the metal complex [1,8-dihydroxynaphthalene-3,6-disulfonato iron (II)] once doped onto the conducting polymer is not undoped in cathodic processes, and the charge balance of the polymer is kept by taking an electrolyte cation in or out. The onset potential where CO{sub 2} was accumulated with the modified electrode was 0 V vs. Ag/AgCl, and the amount of CO{sub 2} on the electrode became largest at {minus}0.2 V. The accumulation of CO{sub 2} with the electrode mediator was caused by the bonding between the mediated PAn and CO{sub 2} through a linkage of the electrophilic carbon atom of CO{sub 2} with the nitrogen atom of the benzenoid ring. The prolonged electrolysis of CO{sub 2} at potentials more negative than {minus}0.3 V led to the generation of C{sub 1} {approximately} C{sub 3} species involving lactic and formic acids, and the scheme of the initial reduction process was disclosed.","","","","USDOE","","United States","1996-11-01T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: Journal of the Electrochemical Society; Journal Volume: 143; Journal Issue: 11; Other Information: PBD: Nov 1996","","Medium: X; Size: pp. 3606-3615","","","","Journal ID: JESOAN; ISSN 0013-4651; TRN: IM9708%%497","10.1149/1.1837260","","2016-05-16T00:00:00Z","428168","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/428168","","Journal of the Electrochemical Society","11","143"

The highest distribution coefficient for butyric acid is shown by solvents with tertiary amines. A ternary solvent with amine extractant, n-alkanes as diluent, and higher alcohol as modifier can be advantageous in this procedure. Amines enable the extraction of acid at a pH above the pK{sub a} value up to about pH 5.6. With an increase of the molecular weight of alcohol, the value of the distribution coefficient decreases. Its value for pure alcohols is independent of the concentration of acid in the aqueous phase.

This model features 10 catalytic reactions coupled to 39 gas-phase chain reactions and accounts for irreducible mass-transport limitations for reactive intermediates. The observed conversions and selectivities are adequately described up to 200 kPa total pressure. the observed strong increase of the conversions between 200 and 1,000 kPa is described qualitatively. The catalyst not only produces radicals but also acts as an important radical quencher. Regeneration of the active sites through water desorption was found to be a kinetically significant step in the catalytic sequence producing methyl radicals. At atmospheric pressure approximately 90% of the methane and oxygen is converted on the surface of Sn/Li/MgO, the balance being converted through branched-chain reactions in the pores of the catalyst and in the interstitial phase. For Li/MgO only one-third of the methane is converted on the catalyst surface. For Sn/Li/MgO the catalytic oxidation of methyl radicals, rather than gas-phase reactions, limits the selectivity toward c{sub 2} products.","","","","","","United States","1996-11-01T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: Industrial and Engineering Chemistry Research; Journal Volume: 35; Journal Issue: 11; Other Information: PBD: Nov 1996","","Medium: X; Size: pp. 3999-4011","","","","Journal ID: IECRED; ISSN 0888-5885; TRN: IM9653%%156","10.1021/ie9504617","","2009-12-16T00:00:00Z","404554","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/404554","","Industrial and Engineering Chemistry Research","11","35"

Separately, Syntroleum-a private company started up in 1986 to commercialize the technology-says it has signed a licensing agreement with Texaco and is negotiating similar deals with several other oil companies. Syntroleum says its process relies on modified Fischer-Tropsch (FT) technology but is able to convert natural gas at lower costs than traditional FT processes. It uses air rather than oxygen to make synthesis gas (snygas)-the initial step in the process; a proprietary FT catalyst is then used to convert the syngas into a narrow molecular range of synthetic fuels. Syntroleum says its deal with Texaco grants the oil company nonexclusive rights to the technology and calls for the two companies to jointly improve the process. Texaco, however, has not decided whether it will build a plant using the Syntroleum technology.","","","","","","United States","1996-10-30T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: Chemical Week; Journal Volume: 158; Journal Issue: 41; Other Information: PBD: 30 Oct 1996","","Medium: X; Size: pp. 40","","","","Journal ID: CHWKA9; ISSN 0009-272X; TRN: 97:000436-0004","","","2009-12-16T00:00:00Z","508320","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/508320","","Chemical Week","41","158"

The acid catalyzed, substitution or bimolecular dehydration of the alcohol to the dibutyl ether was observed under certain catalytic conditions. These catalysts appeared to act as acid/base. Therefore this reaction to produce the ether is of special importance. A correlation between the electronic, structural and catalytic properties has been made to understand molecular processes` role in catalytic phenomena. 44 refs., 6 figs., 5 tabs.","","","","","","United States","1996-10-01T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: Journal of Catalysis; Journal Volume: 163; Journal Issue: 2; Other Information: PBD: Oct 1996","","Medium: X; Size: pp. 262-270","","","","Journal ID: JCTLA5; ISSN 0021-9517; TRN: 97:000667-0004","10.1006/jcat.1996.0327","","2009-12-16T00:00:00Z","501836","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/501836","","Journal of Catalysis","2","163"

As revealed by TPR and XPS, the reduction of copper is inhibited by incorporation of Cs promoter. Under typical reaction conditions, detectable copper phases are reduced to metallic copper. The crystal size of copper particles tends to increase with increasing reduction temperature and simultaneously Cs is segregated to the catalyst surface. Activity results in CO hydrogenation, with and without cofeeding methanol, ethanol, or 1-propanol, showed that methanol of C{sub 2+}OH yield increased upon Cs-doping of the catalysts. By feeding a given C{sub n}OH alcohol, the C{sub n+}OH yield was enhanced, with the most difficult chain growth being for the reaction CH{sub 3}OH{r_arrow}CH{sub 3}CH{sub 2}OH. While a large surface area of the catalysts, with ill-defined crystalline phases, is the key parameter for an enhancement in the productivity and a low increase in the selectivity to higher alcohols, cesium incorporation leads to substantial improvement in C{sub 2+} OH selectivity. 51 refs., 8 figs., 6 tabs.","","","","USDOE","","United States","1996-10-01T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: Journal of Catalysis; Journal Volume: 163; Journal Issue: 2; Other Information: PBD: Oct 1996","","Medium: X; Size: pp. 418-428","","","","Journal ID: JCTLA5; ISSN 0021-9517; TRN: 97:000667-0020","10.1006/jcat.1996.0343","","2016-05-09T00:00:00Z","501852","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/501852","","Journal of Catalysis","2","163"

At a given weight hourly space velocity, a large variation in axial Peclet number (Pe{sub ax}) can be achieved by varying length of duct and gas superficial velocity in proportion, with no substantial effect upon gas-solid contacting efficiency. Herein, the authors report data for the methanol-to-olefin reaction conducted in three ducts at lengths affording Pe{sub ax}-values from {approximately}2 to {approximately}20.

Numerical solution of the equations of mass, species, and energy conservation are performed using a chemical kinetic mechanism recently developed at the National Institute of Standards and Technology. The calculated burning velocities are compared with a set of previously published experimental measurements performed by another laboratory which encompass a range of equivalence ratios and argon, hydrogen, and inhibitor mole fractions with corresponding burning velocities of 21 to 199 cm/s. The effects of the inhibitor on the species profiles for the major products, radials, and fluorinated compounds are determined, and the major reaction pathways for consumption of the inhibitor are discussed. The previously published experimental burning velocities are in good agreement with the results of the present calculations for most of the conditions tested. For those conditions (high fluorine-to-hydrogen ratio in the reactants) where the disagreement is largest, the rate expressions which most influence the burning velocity have been identified. The modeling results indicate that in CO flames (in contrast to hydrocarbon flames) oxygen atom reaction with the inhibitor and inhibitor fragments is a major decomposition pathway, especially when there is a high fluorine-to-hydrogen ratio in the reactants.","","","","","","United States","1996-10-01T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: Combustion and Flame; Journal Volume: 107; Journal Issue: 1-2; Other Information: PBD: Oct 1996","","Medium: X; Size: pp. 72-84","","","","Journal ID: CBFMAO; ISSN 0010-2180; TRN: IM9702%%250","10.1016/0010-2180(96)00009-0","","2009-12-16T00:00:00Z","413475","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/413475","","Combustion and Flame","1-2","107"
"Thermodynamic models to predict gas-liquid solubilities in the methanol synthesis, the methanol-higher alcohol synthesis, and the Fischer-Tropsch synthesis via gas-slurry processes","Breman, B B; Beenackers, A A","01 COAL, LIGNITE, AND PEAT; 10 SYNTHETIC FUELS; FISCHER-TROPSCH SYNTHESIS; THERMODYNAMIC MODEL; SOLUBILITY; EQUATIONS OF STATE; COMPARATIVE EVALUATIONS","Various thermodynamic models were tested concerning their applicability to predict gas-liquid solubilities, relevant for synthesis gas conversion to methanol, higher alcohols, and hydrocarbons via gas-slurry processes. Without any parameter optimization the group contribution equation of state (GCEOS) turns out to be the best model with an average, relative deviation of 19.0%. If a single binary interaction parameter is optimized for each binary system, the Peng-Robinson equation of state, the regular solutions theory, and the Flory-Staverman model all give good predictions with average, relative deviations 4.0, 10.4, and 10.0%, respectively. As expected, the predictions from these models improve further and agree excellently with the experimental values by optimizing two binary interaction parameters for each binary system (average relative deviations <2% for all models). The gas-liquid solubilities could also be correlated accurately to the temperature (average relative deviation = 2.1%) by assuming a constant enthalpy of solution (CEOS) models. For particular binary systems the Flory-Staverman model and the CEOS model give also reasonably accurate predictions of the gas-liquid solubilities by calculating the binary interaction parameters from pure component properties. Such an approach is promising for predicting as yet unknown gas-liquid solubilities without the need for experimental data.","","","","","","United States","1996-10-01T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: Industrial and Engineering Chemistry Research; Journal Volume: 35; Journal Issue: 10; Other Information: PBD: Oct 1996","","Medium: X; Size: pp. 3763-3775","","","","Journal ID: IECRED; ISSN 0888-5885; TRN: IM9702%%228","10.1021/ie9600755","","2009-12-16T00:00:00Z","413453","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/413453","","Industrial and Engineering Chemistry Research","10","35"

The present study concentrated on the oxidative conversion of methane in an atmospheric pressure, nonthermal plasma formed by ac or dc corona discharges. Methyl radicals are formed by reaction with negatively-charged oxygen species created in the corona discharge. The selectivity to products ethane and ethylene is affected by electrode polarity, frequency, and oxygen partial pressure in the feed. Higher C{sub 2} yields were obtained with the ac corona. All the ac corona discharges are initiated at room temperature (i.e., no oven or other heat source is used), and the temperature increases to 300--500 C due to the exothermic reactions and the discharge itself. The largest C{sub 2} yield is 21% with 43.3% methane conversion and 48.3% C{sub 2} selectivity at a flowrate of 100 cm{sup 3}/min when the ac corona is at 30 Hz, 5 kV (rms) input power was used. The methane conversion may be improved to more than 50% by increasing the residence time, but the C{sub 2} selectivity decreases. A reaction mechanism including the oxidative dehydrogenation (OXD) of ethane to ethylene is presented to explain the observed phenomena. The results suggest that ac and/or dc gas discharge techniques have significant promise for improving the economics of OCM processes.","","","","","","United States","1996-10-01T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: Industrial and Engineering Chemistry Research; Journal Volume: 35; Journal Issue: 10; Other Information: PBD: Oct 1996","","Medium: X; Size: pp. 3295-3301","","","FG21-94MC31170","Journal ID: IECRED; ISSN 0888-5885; TRN: IM9702%%200","10.1021/ie960138j","","2009-12-16T00:00:00Z","414110","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/414110","","Industrial and Engineering Chemistry Research","10","35"

Characterization of the catalysts were performed with electron microscopy combined with element analysis (HR-TEM/EDAX), X-ray diffraction (XRD), temperature-programmed reduction (TPR), and thermomagnetic analysis. A homogeneous distribution of the iron containing phase can be obtained by using the metal complexes ammonium iron (III) citrate or ammonium (III) iron EDTA. A simple salt, such as iron nitrate, proved to be less suitable for this purpose. By HR-TEM/EDAX, it was shown that coverage of the zirconia support had been accomplished. XRL showed that crystalline Fe{sub 2}O{sub 3} particles were formed at loadings {ge} 3 wt% Fe. TPR studies point to a bi-modal particle size distribution for the catalysts with 3 wt% Fe.

Magnetization measurements confirmed the results obtained by TPR. Catalysts prepared by coimpregnation of iron and potassium were also studied.

These effects are consistent with the Scatchard equation which relates the rate constant to the dielectric constant of the reaction medium.","","","","","","United States","1996-09-01T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: Industrial and Engineering Chemistry Research; Journal Volume: 35; Journal Issue: 9; Other Information: PBD: Sep 1996","","Medium: X; Size: pp. 3044-3054","","","","Journal ID: IECRED; ISSN 0888-5885; TRN: IM9642%%331","10.1021/ie950755s","","2009-12-16T00:00:00Z","376242","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/376242","","Industrial and Engineering Chemistry Research","9","35"
"Expanded scope of supported aqueous phase catalysis: Efficient rhodium-catalyzed hydroformylation of {alpha},{beta}-unsaturated esters","Fremy, G; Carpentier, J F; Mortreux, A","40 CHEMISTRY; 10 SYNTHETIC FUELS; RHODIUM; CATALYTIC EFFECTS; ESTERS; CARBONYLATION; SILICA; CATALYST SUPPORTS; HETEROGENEOUS CATALYSIS","The use of supported aqueous-phase (SAP) catalysts for the rhodium-based hydroformylation of methyl acrylate leads under optimal conditions to much higher activities than those observed under comparable homogeneous and biphasic conditions. The results obtained with a series of acrylic esters are found to be dependent on the water content of the solid support and on the solubility of the functionalized olefin in water. For soluble organic reactants, like methyl acrylate, optimal activities are obtained for fully filled pore volume materials. For less soluble organic reactants, like butyl acrylate, hydroformylations are best achieved with a lower degree of pore filling, strictly dependent on the nature of the functionalized olefin. It is assumed that the reaction of hydrophilic olefins occurs mainly in the homogeneous water film dispersed over the solid support, whilst that of lipophilic olefins takes place at the interface between the organic phase and the aqueous film. The effects of temperature and the nature of the solid support are reported. Experiments are described that indicate that the surface area and the chemical nature of the solid play a major role on the activity of the SAP catalyst, whilst the pore diameter has almost no influence. However, a decrease in the activity of methyl acrylate hydroformylation was observed upon recycling of the SAPC materials, which was attributed to the leaching of rhodium into the organic phase and the gradual dehydration of silica. 24 refs., 8 figs., 3 tabs.","","","","","","United States","1996-09-01T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: Journal of Catalysis; Journal Volume: 162; Journal Issue: 2; Other Information: PBD: 1 Sep 1996","","Medium: X; Size: pp. 339-348","","","","Journal ID: JCTLA5; ISSN 0021-9517; TRN: 97:000357-0019","10.1006/jcat.1996.0291","","2009-12-16T00:00:00Z","494285","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/494285","","Journal of Catalysis","2","162"
"Promoting effect of Pt on Co mordenite upon the reducibility and catalytic behavior of CO{sub 2} hydrogenation","Boix, A V; Ulla, M A; Petunchi, J O","01 COAL, LIGNITE, AND PEAT; 10 SYNTHETIC FUELS; 40 CHEMISTRY; PLATINUM; CATALYTIC EFFECTS; MORDENITE; CARBON DIOXIDE; HYDROGENATION; COBALT; CATALYST SUPPORTS; HETEROGENEOUS CATALYSIS","The reducibility of Co and Pt mordenite monometallic and bimetallic samples with different Co/Pt ratios was studied by temperature-programmed reduction. The species formed after reduction were characterized by X-ray diffraction (XRD) and XPS. Co mordenite samples presented a very low reducibility in the 273-823 K range, whereas the Pt monometallic samples were totally reduced in that range with a H{sub 2}/Pt ratio = 1. Two well-differentiated reduction zones in the 273-573 K and 573-823 K ranges were observed in these samples, suggesting a Pt{sup 2+} ions distribution at the exchange sites of the mordenites. A proportion of 70: 30% for the two zones resulted, independent of the Pt loading. The incorporation of platinum notably increased the Co reducibility. The type and stability of the species formed during the reduction depended on the Co/Pt ratio. In the sample with a lower content of Pt, a catalytic action of the latter prevailed, leading to reduced species formed by a fine dispersion of metallic Co and Pt particles. When the Pt content increased, the formation of PtCo{sub x}O{sub y} species during calcination seemed to be the precursor of the promoting effect. For high contents of Pt (5%), Co/Pt = 0.6, XPS results revealed an important Co-Pt interaction. After sinterization, Pt{sub 3}Co particles were clearly observed by XRD. The Pt-Co interaction modified the specific activity and selectivity to CH{sub 4} of the monometallic species in the CO{sub 2} hydrogenation reaction. The samples with a Co/Pt ratio = 5.9 presented a maximum in the methanating activity, thus resulting in a turnover frequency for CH{sub 4} production, N{sub CH4} = 0.20 (s{sup -1}) at 623 K and 1 atm. This turnover frequency dropped to 0.015 for Co/Pt=0.6. 37 refs., 4 figs., 5 tabs.","","","","","","United States","1996-09-01T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: Journal of Catalysis; Journal Volume: 162; Journal Issue: 2; Other Information: PBD: 1 Sep 1996","","Medium: X; Size: pp. 239-249","","","","Journal ID: JCTLA5; ISSN 0021-9517; TRN: 97:000357-0009","10.1006/jcat.1996.0281","","2009-12-16T00:00:00Z","494275","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/494275","","Journal of Catalysis","2","162"

Elementary events such as adsorption, diffusion, and desorption of the species involved (hydrogen, ethylene, and ethane) and reaction on the surface were considered. Based on comparison between experimental and calculated data no distinction has to be made between competitive and non-competitive hydrogen adsorption sites nor has adsorbed hydrogen activation to be taken into consideration. However, steric hindrance caused by adsorbed ethylene and ethane has been included in the model. Not only was the basic physical and chemical behavior reproduced by this very simple model, but also important experimental findings such as the trend of the turnover frequency versus hydrogen pressure (ph{sub 2}) and the magnitudes of reaction orders for hydrogen and ethylene. In addition this model can predict some aspects of hydrocarbon hydrogenation not investigated experimentally so far. 23 refs., 6 tabs., 2 tabs.","","","","","","United States","1996-09-01T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: Journal of Catalysis; Journal Volume: 162; Journal Issue: 2; Other Information: PBD: 1 Sep 1996","","Medium: X; Size: pp. 260-267","","","","Journal ID: JCTLA5; ISSN 0021-9517; TRN: 97:000357-0011","10.1006/jcat.1996.0283","","2009-12-16T00:00:00Z","494277","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/494277","","Journal of Catalysis","2","162"

The alumina-supported zirconia (ZrO{sub 2}/Al{sub 2}O{sub 3}. China Patent CN1065026A) is an excellent catalyst for the selective synthesis of ethylene from CO and H{sub 2} (CO:H{sub 2} = 1:4, CO conversion:30%). Both the selectivity to ethylene (70%) and the stability under the reaction conditions based on a 400-h testing offers intriguing prospects for commercialization of this catalyst. Four forms of crystalline zirconia have been reported, but only the monoclinic and tetragonal phases are often found in catalysts. The study on the structure of amorphous zirconia on the surface of metal oxides is still rare. Extended X-ray absorption fine structure (EXAFS) opens the possibility of structure and coordination geometry determination not possible by diffraction techniques and makes possible the observation at atomic level for such aperiodic systems with the same ease as crystals. In this paper, a combination of X-ray diffraction (XRD) and EXAFS techniques is applied to characterize zirconium oxide on the surface of ZrO{sub 2}/Al{sub 2}O{sub 3} in an attempt to gain a comprehensive understanding of the EXAFS- and XRD-derived results and to gain a fundamental understanding of the active sites on the catalyst. 34 refs., 2 figs., 1 tab.","","","","","","United States","1996-09-01T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: Journal of Catalysis; Journal Volume: 162; Journal Issue: 2; Other Information: PBD: 1 Sep 1996","","Medium: X; Size: pp. 361-364","","","","Journal ID: JCTLA5; ISSN 0021-9517; TRN: 97:000357-0022","","","2009-12-16T00:00:00Z","494288","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/494288","","Journal of Catalysis","2","162"

Performance data are compared on the basis of a simplified kinetic model for n-butane oxidation involving a series-consecutive reaction scheme of pseudo first-order reactions (where C{sub 4}H{sub 2}O{sub 3} signifies maleic anhydride). Using this simplified kinetic scheme it is possible to calculate three factors: (a) the rate constants for butane conversion corrected for surface area (k{sub 1} + k{sub 2})/sa which is a measure of the specific activity; (b) the primary selectivity S{sub 0} (selectivity extrapolated to zero conversion); and (c) the relative rates of oxidation of n-butane and maleic anhydride k{sub 3}/(k{sub 1} + k{sub 2}), the latter two factors being a measure of the selectivity of the catalyst. It is proposed that these can be used to determine the relative catalytic performance of promoted catalysts. Hence an improved catalyst would require high specific activity (i.e., a high value of (k{sub 1} + k{sub 2})/sa) together with high maleic anhydride selectivity (i.e., a high value of S{sub 0} and a low value of k{sub 3}/[k{sub 1} + k{sub 2}]). For catalysts prepared by the isobutanol/HCl method the addition of Co is found to promote the specific activity while Mo is found to promote both the specific activity is observed although certain additives are found to act as poisons (Ag, Cs) while others promote the oxidation of maleic anhydride (Cs, Pd, Ru, Zn).","","","","","","United States","1996-09-01T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: Journal of Catalysis; Journal Volume: 162; Journal Issue: 2; Other Information: PBD: 1 Sep 1996","","Medium: X; Size: pp. 153-168","","","","Journal ID: JCTLA5; ISSN 0021-9517; TRN: 97:000357-0001","10.1006/jcat.1996.0273","","2009-12-16T00:00:00Z","494267","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/494267","","Journal of Catalysis","2","162"

The reducibility of the catalysts by hydrogen, ethane, and ethylene and their reoxidation by oxygen were determined by thermogravimetry linked to differential scanning calorimetry and by a pulse catalytic test linked to a microcalorimeter. Ammonia and sulphur dioxide microcalorimetry adsorptions were carried out on all catalysts to characterize their acid-base properties. In ethane ODH reaction at the steady state at 823 K, 60% ethylene selectivity was obtained at 28% ethane conversion. The improved catalytic properties for such reaction on vanadia/{gamma}-alumina catalysts compared to vanadia/silica and bulk vanadium pentoxide catalysts appear to be related in the first place to the dispersion and coordination degree of the vanadium cations of the active sites, and in the second to the development of their acidic properties. The active sites are suggested to be oxidized vanadate dimers composed of tetrahedrally coordinated and oxygen-bridged vanadium cations operations according to a redox mechanism involving very probably transient radicals generated via one-electron transfer. Such dimers undergo a relatively high rate of reduction by ethane. The population of vanadate dimers was estimated in the case of the sample with 20 wt% V{sub 2}O{sub 5} loading. The number and strength of active sites are described.

The chemical kinetics are represented using a three-step reduced mechanism, and the transport equation is solved by a Monte Carlo method. A detailed analysis of computational performance and a comparison between the neural network approach and other methods used to represent the chemistry, namely the look-up table, or the direct integration procedures, are presented. A multilayer perceptron architecture is chosen for the neural network. The training algorithm is based on a back-propagation supervised learning procedure with individual momentum terms and adaptive learning rate adjustment for the weights matrix. A new procedure for the selection of training samples using dynamic randomization is developed and is aimed at reducing the possibility of the network being trapped in a local minimum. This algorithm achieved an impressive acceleration in convergence compared with the use of a fixed set of selected training samples. The optimization process of the neural network is discussed in detail. The feasibility of using neural network models to represent highly nonlinear chemical reactions is successfully illustrated. The prediction of the flow field and flame characteristics using the neural network approach is in good agreement with those obtained using other methods, and is also in reasonable agreement with the experimental data. The computational benefits of the neural network approach over the look-up table and the direct integration methods, both in CPU time and RAM storage requirements are not great for a chemical mechanisms of less than three reactions. The neural network approach becomes superior, however, for more complex reaction schemes.","","","","","","United States","1996-09-01T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: Combustion and Flame; Journal Volume: 106; Journal Issue: 4; Other Information: PBD: Sep 1996","","Medium: X; Size: pp. 406-427","","","","Journal ID: CBFMAO; ISSN 0010-2180; TRN: IM9702%%237","10.1016/0010-2180(95)00250-2","","2009-12-16T00:00:00Z","413462","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/413462","","Combustion and Flame","4","106"

Two types are reviewed in this paper, namely, mixtures resulting from addition of certain metallic or nonmetallic elements to conventional hydrocarbon fuels, and newly synthesized hydrocarbon fuels with strained molecular conformations or more densely packed molecular structures. Despite the favorable effects of high-energy content, these materials often exhibit low reactivity and their ability to improve the performance of practical combustion systems relies strongly on their interaction with the dynamics of the surrounding fluid flow. The intensity of the combustion processes of these materials is dictated, in general, by the melting, evaporation, pyrolysis, mixing, and exothermic reactions processes. Unlike other conventional hydrocarbon fuels, all these process time scales are often comparable with each other, causing difficulties to devise simpler theoretical models to predict the combustion characteristics. Both the advances made in recent years and the needs for future research and development in the field of energetic fuels are discussed.","","","","USDOE","","United States","1996-09-01T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: Journal of Energy Resources Technology; Journal Volume: 118; Journal Issue: 3; Other Information: PBD: Sep 1996","","Medium: X; Size: pp. 180-186","","","","Journal ID: JERTD2; ISSN 0195-0738; TRN: IM9643%%156","10.1115/1.2793860","","2016-04-22T00:00:00Z","377883","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/377883","","Journal of Energy Resources Technology","3","118"

Three different PEGs whose molecular weights are 200, 1000, and 20,000 were employed, and their mass fractions in the liquid phase were up to 0.35. The volatility of water was reduced by the addition of PEG, and the azeotropic point of the 2-propanol + water system was changed to a higher mole fraction of 2-propanol. Activity coefficients of solvent were calculated by assuming the monodispersity of PEG. It was found that the activity coefficients of water were selectively decreased by the addition of PEG. These phenomena did not depend on the molecular weight of PEG.","","","","","","United States","1996-09-01T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: Journal of Chemical and Engineering Data; Journal Volume: 41; Journal Issue: 5; Other Information: PBD: Sep-Oct 1996","","Medium: X; Size: pp. 956-960","","","","Journal ID: JCEAAX; ISSN 0021-9568; TRN: IM9643%%285","10.1021/je960040b","","2009-12-16T00:00:00Z","378011","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/378011","","Journal of Chemical and Engineering Data","5","41"

The catalyst was prepared by impregnation of commercial {alpha}-alumina pellets (1.3 m{sup 2}/g) in a Ag{sub 2}O/lactic acid solution and contained 13.87 wt% Ag and 420 ppm Cs by weight. The fresh and used catalysts have been characterized using scanning electron microscopy (SEM), ion scattering spectroscopy, Auger electron spectroscopy, and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy. With aging, the fresh catalyst becomes more active (percentage of conversion to ethylene oxide increases), and then the activity drops with increasing reaction time. Large changes are observed in the spectra obtained from these surfaces which are due primarily to morphological changes caused by sintering as observed in the SEM micrographs. The surface Cl content is increased at the support surface by adsorption of ethyl chloride, added in small amounts to the feed gas as a moderator, from the gas phase. The surface also becomes enriched in Na due to migration of the Na binder material to the surface where it associates with the Cl to from NaCl. The SEM micrographs indicate that both the Ag and alumina crystallites grow with age and that the large Ag crystallites do not interact with the aged alumina surface suggesting that the formation of NaCl plays a role in the sintering process. 12 refs., 5 figs.","","","","","","United States","1996-08-01T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: Journal of Catalysis; Journal Volume: 162; Journal Issue: 1; Other Information: PBD: Aug 1996","","Medium: X; Size: pp. 48-53","","","","Journal ID: JCTLA5; ISSN 0021-9517; CNN: Grant CTS-9122575; TRN: 97:000067-0005","10.1006/jcat.1996.0258","","2009-12-16T00:00:00Z","508440","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/508440","","Journal of Catalysis","1","162"

In situ infrared spectroscopy was used to characterize the surface of the catalyst. Exposure of the catalyst to CO or CO{sub 2} produced very similar infrared spectra in which the principal features are those for linearly and bridge-bonded CO. In the case of CO{sub 2} adsorption, a band for weakly adsorbed CO{sub 2} could also be observed. For identical reaction conditions the rate of CO{sub 2} could also be observed. For identical reaction conditions the rate of CO{sub 2} hydrogenation to methane is higher than that for CO hydrogenation. The activation energy for CO hydrogenation is 23.2 kcal/mol and that for CO{sub 2} hydrogenation is 16.6 kcal/mol. The partial pressure dependances on H{sub 2} and CO{sub z} (z = 1, 2) are 0.67 and -0.80, respectively, for CO hydrogenation, and 0.53 and -0.46, respectively, for CO{sub 2} hydrogenation. Infrared spectroscopy reveals that under reaction conditions the catalyst surface is nearly saturated by absorbed CO. The spectra observed during CO and CO{sub 2} hydrogenation are similar, the principal difference being that the CO coverage during CO hydrogenation is somewhat higher than that during CO{sub 2} hydrogenation. The CO coverage is insensitive to H{sub 2} partial pressure, but increases slightly with increasing CO{sub z} partial pressure. Transient-response experiments demonstrate that the adsorbed CO is a critical intermediate in both reaction systems. It is proposed that the rate determining step in the formation of methane is the dissociation of H{sub 2}CO, produced by the stepwise hydrogenation of adsorbed CO. A rate expression derived from the proposed mechanism properly describes the experimentally observed reaction kinetics both under steady-state and transient-response conditions. 88 refs., 17 figs., 3 tabs.","","","","","","United States","1996-08-01T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: Journal of Catalysis; Journal Volume: 162; Journal Issue: 1; Other Information: PBD: Aug 1996","","Medium: X; Size: pp. 54-65","","","AC03-76SF00098","Journal ID: JCTLA5; ISSN 0021-9517; TRN: 97:000067-0006","10.1006/jcat.1996.0259","","2009-12-16T00:00:00Z","508441","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/508441","","Journal of Catalysis","1","162"

The process of solid transformation and the properties of prepared materials were compared with those of nitride and carbide made from MoO{sub 3}. Product phases were produced at much lower temperature from HPA, and smaller crystallite sizes were obtained. Yet, HPA-derived materials showed lower surface areas and CO chemisorption probably because phosphorus remaining in the products blocked their pores and adsorption sites. Since the involved solid transformations were topotactic, two precursors yielded products with completely different morphology of the particles. The distribution of phosphorus in HPA-derived Mo{sub 2}N was highly uniform. 26 refs., 10 figs., 3 tabs.","","","","","","United States","1996-08-01T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: Journal of Catalysis; Journal Volume: 162; Journal Issue: 1; Other Information: PBD: Aug 1996","","Medium: X; Size: pp. 76-87","","","","Journal ID: JCTLA5; ISSN 0021-9517; TRN: 97:000067-0008","10.1006/jcat.1996.0261","","2009-12-16T00:00:00Z","508443","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/508443","","Journal of Catalysis","1","162"
"UK group plans major methanol project","","10 SYNTHETIC FUELS; METHANOL; PRODUCTION; CHEMICAL PLANTS; CAPACITY","International Offshore Chemicals (IOC; Aberdeen, UK), a project development and management company, has formed a consortium to seek permission to build a 2,500-m.t./day methanol plant near the St. Fergus terminal in northeast Scotland. Robert Spiers, technical adviser to IOC, tells CW that the $255-million plant, based on the ICI process, would begin production in second-quarter 1999. The key market would be Europe. Jacobs Engineering and Davy are negotiating for the construction contract. Spiers says Europe imports 3 million m.t./year of methanol, and-even with Statoil`s plant under construction in Norway-there is room for more. ICI is the UK`s only producer of methanol. Another company, reportedly Kemira, may build a 360,000-m.t./year ammonia plant nearby if the methanol scheme goes ahead.","","","","","","United States","1996-07-31T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: Chemical Week; Journal Volume: 159; Journal Issue: 29; Other Information: PBD: 31 Jul 1996","","Medium: X; Size: pp. 24","","","","Journal ID: CHWKA9; ISSN 0009-272X; TRN: 96:006324-0001","","","2009-12-16T00:00:00Z","450732","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/450732","","Chemical Week","29","159"

However, the first step of the reaction, involving methanol adsorption on the zeolite catalyst, is still not well understood. This paper describes first-principles calculations performed on periodic zeolite models to investigate the nature of methanol adsorption. We have examined a number of possible geometries for this adsorption and found that the nature of the adsorbed species can depend on the particular zeolites structure. In more open ring structures, as found in chabazite, the stable form of methanol is found to be protonated, in contrast to results of previous calculations on cluster models. However, in the sodalite structure methanol is found to be simply physisorbed. The vibrational spectra of the adsorbed species have been studied and compared to experimental results. It is found that both chemisorbed methanol and physisorbed methanol give strongly red-shifted O-H stretching frequencies, but the former can be distinguished by the H-O-H bending mode. 50 refs., 13 figs., 3 tabs.","","","","","","United States","1996-07-11T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: Journal of Physical Chemistry; Journal Volume: 100; Journal Issue: 28; Other Information: PBD: 11 Jul 1996","","Medium: X; Size: pp. 11688-11697","","","","Journal ID: JPCHAX; ISSN 0022-3654; TRN: 96:004839-006","10.1021/jp960365z","","2009-12-16T00:00:00Z","374443","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/374443","","Journal of Physical Chemistry","28","100"

Numerical analyses were performed using an isobaric, plug-flow reactor model coupled with the Chemkin Real-Gas software package to handle real-gas thermodynamic effects and elementary kinetics. In the present work, select unimolecular reactions that involve thermal decomposition have been corrected for the high-pressure conditions found in supercritical reactors. Predictions of fuel destruction rates obtained using an elementary reaction mechanism for hydrogen oxidation under isobaric, isothermal supercritical conditions (P > 22.1 MPa, and T > 374 C) were verified by comparison with previous experimental results obtained in a laboratory-scale supercritical water reactor. The H{sub 2}-O{sub 2} model is a subset of a proposed elementary reaction mechanism for methanol oxidation which was also verified by comparing the present model predictions of the kinetic rate calculations with previous measurements. The mechanism was validated over a temperature range of 726 to 873 K, a fuel concentration range of 0.001 to 0.004 mole/L, and at a pressure of 246 bar. To facilitate future computational fluid dynamic (CFD) modeling efforts in SCWO, a two-step reduced reaction mechanism was constructed to simulate the oxidation process of methanol in supercritical water and H{sub 2}O. The reduced model reflects the sequential oxidation of methanol into carbon monoxide, and eventually into final products consisting primarily of carbon dioxide and H{sub 2}O. The calculations of the two-step reduced mechanism matched the elementary reaction model well with respect to major species concentration profiles.","","","","","","United States","1996-07-01T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: Combustion and Flame; Journal Volume: 106; Journal Issue: 1-2; Other Information: PBD: Jul 1996","","Medium: X; Size: pp. 110-130","","","","Journal ID: CBFMAO; ISSN 0010-2180; TRN: IM9633%%334","10.1016/0010-2180(95)00247-2","","2009-12-16T00:00:00Z","264397","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/264397","","Combustion and Flame","1-2","106"

By simulating the addition of selected reaction intermediates to the CO/H{sub 2} feed stream and comparing predicted and measured effects on the product distribution, novel pieces of evidence are gained concerning the mechanistic consistency of the model. The adequacy of the kinetic scheme is confirmed. However, inaccuracies due to the lack of previous information and to the numerical complexity of the model have been identified. In particular, an overestimation of the contribution of ketones in the chain-growth process of aldehydes and primary alcohols has been detected.

Experiments were conducted in supercritical water over temperatures ranging from 440 to 500 C at 24.1 MPa and at a nominal feed concentration of 0.05 mol/L (1.5 wt %). Effluent samples were also examined using gas chromatography. In these experiments, feed concentrations ranging from 0.011 to 1.2 wt % and temperatures from 430 to 500 C were examined and showed that the effective first-order reaction rate for the oxidation of methanol is dependent on the initial feed concentration. Raman measurements reveal a temperature-dependent induction period of less than 1 s over the range of conditions investigated. In addition, quantitative measurements of the production of formaldehyde indicate it is a key metastable intermediate. An elementary reaction mechanism, which reproduces accurately the quantitative features of methanol oxidation and formaldehyde production, is used to identify key rate controlling reactions during the induction period and the transition to the primary oxidation path.","","","","","","United States","1996-07-01T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: Industrial and Engineering Chemistry Research; Journal Volume: 35; Journal Issue: 7; Other Information: PBD: Jul 1996","","Medium: X; Size: pp. 2161-2171","","","","Journal ID: IECRED; ISSN 0888-5885; TRN: IM9636%%441","10.1021/ie950510f","","2009-12-16T00:00:00Z","276737","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/276737","","Industrial and Engineering Chemistry Research","7","35"

Without CO, {approximately}8 x 10{sup -3} methanol molecules per second per Cu surface atom were produced at 530 K, with an activation energy of 67 {+-} 17 kJ/mol; and {approximately}5 CO molecules per second per Cu surface atom were produced, with an activation energy of 78 {+-} 14 kJ/mol. The rates, compared to previous rates on Cu(100) and polycrystalline copper foil, were higher in both methanol synthesis and CO production, indicating structural sensitivity. The activation energy for methanol synthesis was similar on all three planes, but smaller for reverse water-gas shift on Cu(110) than on polycrystalline Cu. The surface after reaction was covered by almost a full monolayer of adsorbed formate, but no other species like carbon or oxygen in measureable amounts. The addition of CO to the feed caused the rate to increase, and no buildup of tenacious carbon was observed following reaction. Postreaction TPD shows an interesting influence of CO on the nature of the adlayer. These results support a model where the active site for methanol synthesis on real Cu/ZnO catalysts in metallic Cu and suggest that the role of ZnO may be to maintain more of the metallic Cu in ultrathin islands that have (110)-like behavior. 79 refs., 3 figs.","","","","","","United States","1996-07-01T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: Journal of Catalysis; Journal Volume: 161; Journal Issue: 2; Other Information: PBD: Jul 1996","","Medium: X; Size: pp. 776-782","","","","Journal ID: JCTLA5; ISSN 0021-9517; TRN: 96:005122-0031","10.1006/jcat.1996.0240","","2009-12-16T00:00:00Z","447121","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/447121","","Journal of Catalysis","2","161"

But reactions that use O{sub 2} as the primary oxidant often produce large amounts of unwanted byproducts. One major reason that selectivities are low is that the desired products (such as alcohols or carbonyls) are more easily oxidized by O{sub 2} than the parent hydrocarbon. The authors recently discovered a simple method that gives partial oxidation of small alkenes, alkanes, and alkyl-substituted benzenes by O{sub 2} at unprecedented selectivity, even at high conversion of the hydrocarbon. The approach is based on visible light-induced chemistry of hydrocarbon-O{sub 2} collisional pairs in the cages of large-pore zeolites. Reactions are conducted at ambient temperature in the absence of solvent or photosensitizer. Here the authors describe the most interesting reactions established thus far and define issues that pertain to scale-up of the method.","","","","","","United States","1996-06-01T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: CHEMTECH; Journal Volume: 26; Journal Issue: 6; Other Information: PBD: Jun 1996","","Medium: X; Size: pp. 24-30","","","AC03-76SF00098","Journal ID: CHTEDD; ISSN 0009-2703; TRN: IM9632%%285","","","2009-12-16T00:00:00Z","260715","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/260715","","CHEMTECH","6","26"

This not only enhances the efficiency of the process by maintaining an uninterrupted supply of thermal energy, but it reduces the flame length and NO{sub x} emissions. The effects of changes in the jet nozzle geometry, i.e., nozzle shape and lip thickness, on the blowout limits of jet diffusion flames in a co-flowing air stream were experimentally investigated for a range of co-flow air stream velocities. Circular and elongated nozzles of different axes ratios were employed. Preliminary results showed that nozzles with low major-to-minor axes ratios improved, while high ratios reduced the blowout limit of attached flames compared with that for an equivalent circular nozzle. The nozzle shape had no apparent influence on the blowout limits lifted flames and the limiting stream velocity. The experimental blowout limits of lifted flames were found to be a function of the co-flowing stream velocity and jet discharge area. On the other hand, the stability of attached flames was a function of the co-flowing stream velocity, jet discharge area as well as the nozzle shape. The effect of premixing a fuel with the surrounding air was also studied. Generally, the introduction of auxiliary fuel into the surrounding stream either increased or decreased the blowout limit depending on the type of flame stabilization mechanism prior to blowout. The stability mechanism of the flame was found to be a function of the co-flow stream velocity and the auxiliary fuel employed. Methane was employed as the jet fuel, while methane, propane, ethylene, and hydrogen were used as auxiliary fuels in the co-flowing stream.","","","","USDOE","","United States","1996-06-01T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: Journal of Energy Resources Technology; Journal Volume: 118; Journal Issue: 2; Other Information: DN: Presented at eighteenth annual energy-sources technology conference and exhibition, January 29--February 1, 1995, Houston, TX (US); PBD: Jun 1996","","Medium: X; Size: pp. 134-139","","","","Journal ID: JERTD2; ISSN 0195-0738; TRN: IM9630%%145","10.1115/1.2792704","","2016-04-21T00:00:00Z","253694","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/253694","","Journal of Energy Resources Technology","2","118"

Temperatures were measured by thermocouple and by OH laser-induced fluorescence. Stable species profiles were determined from mass spectrometer measurements using a quartz microprobe, and OH and CH concentrations were determined using LIF. The experiments were analyzed with the aid of a chemical kinetic model. The most noteworthy result of the experiments is that significant quantities of benzene appear in the flame with allene, whereas there is no detectable benzene in the pure acetylene flame. This result lends support to the theory that the reaction between two propargyl radicals is an important ``cyclization step`` in flames. Various aspects of the flame chemistry are discussed in depth.","","","","","","United States","1996-06-01T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: Combustion and Flame; Journal Volume: 105; Journal Issue: 4; Other Information: PBD: Jun 1996","","Medium: X; Size: pp. 451-461","","","","Journal ID: CBFMAO; ISSN 0010-2180; TRN: IM9629%%396","10.1016/0010-2180(95)00227-8","","2009-12-16T00:00:00Z","251083","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/251083","","Combustion and Flame","4","105"

The conditions examined involve laminar flames operating above and below their smoke point. In-flame diagnostics are employed to discern the interaction between the soot matrix and additive combustion products. The data presented in a previous study, as produced by thermophoretic sampling, transmission electron microscopy and high-resolution microanalysis techniques, are supplemented by soot volume fraction, temperature, and soot primary size measurements to unravel the mechanisms through which ferrocene combustion products influence soot formation processes. Furthermore, Z-contrast scanning/transmission electron microscopy is used to examine the over-fire aerosol and, in turn, provide insight on the fine-scale dispersion of iron fragments within the carbonaceous soot matrix. It is shown that ferrocene seeding of the fuel stream accelerates the particular inception mechanisms, but does not influence soot loadings when soot growth is dominant. Ferrocene is also found to enhance soot oxidation rates near the flame terminus. It is concluded that the fine-scale incorporation of iron compounds within the soot matrix is a primary factor for the soot suppressing role of ferrocene in nonpremixed flames.","","","","","","United States","1996-06-01T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: Combustion and Flame; Journal Volume: 105; Journal Issue: 4; Other Information: PBD: Jun 1996","","Medium: X; Size: pp. 528-540","","","","Journal ID: CBFMAO; ISSN 0010-2180; TRN: IM9629%%402","10.1016/0010-2180(95)00209-X","","2009-12-16T00:00:00Z","251089","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/251089","","Combustion and Flame","4","105"

The following results have been obtained: In the 20 wt% Ni/La{sub 2}O{sub 3} prepared using Ni(NO{sub 3}){sub 2} as precursor, LaNiO{sub 3} and La(OH){sub 3} were the only compounds identified by XRD in the sample calcined in O{sub 2} and La{sub 2}NiO{sub 4} and La(OH){sub 3} were the only compounds identified in the sample calcined in He. At lower Ni contents, the La{sub 2}O{sub 3} phase was additionally identified. For the 20 wt% Ni/La{sub 2}O{sub 3} prepared using Ni chloride as precursor, LaOCl was the only compound detected by XRD; no phase containing Ni was identified by XRD in the samples calcined in O{sub 2} or He. At lower Ni chloride contents, LaNiO{sub 3} was additionally detected in the sample calcined in O{sub 2} and La{sub 2}NiO{sub 4} in that calcined in He. A comparison between the XRD spectra and the TPR curves suggested the presence of amorphous NiO in the samples based on Ni chloride. It is also shown that the Ni precursor employed in the preparation of the catalyst plays a role in the CO{sub 2} reforming of CH{sub 4}. During the CO{sub 2} reforming of methane, the unreduced Ni/La{sub 2}O{sub 3} catalysts, based on Ni nitrate, had a high initial CO yield but a low time stability; in contrast, the unreduced Ni/La{sub 2}O{sub 3} catalysts, based on chloride, had a high stability. A possible explanation of this behavior, based on ESCA analysis and on the reaction between CH{sub 4} and catalysts, is provided.","","","","","","United States","1996-06-01T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: Journal of Catalysis; Journal Volume: 161; Journal Issue: 1; Other Information: PBD: Jun 1996","","Medium: X; Size: pp. 55-61","","","","Journal ID: JCTLA5; ISSN 0021-9517; TRN: 97:000028-0006","10.1006/jcat.1996.0161","","2009-12-16T00:00:00Z","471604","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/471604","","Journal of Catalysis","1","161"

At the temperatures used ({ge}80{degrees}C), H{sub 2} desorption parallels CH{sub 4} chemisorption but no C{sub 2}H{sub 6} is observed. During the following temperature programmed desorption under flowing argon, CH{sub 4} is removed through a wide range of temperature (from room temperature to 300{degrees}C) with a first contribution peaking at less than 100{degrees}C. Very small amounts of CH{sub 4} are desorbed after an adsorption carried out at T{ge} 180{degrees}C, due to strong dehydrogenation of the adspecies. Subsequent temperature programmed surface reaction of the remaining adspecies with hydrogen displays upto four CH{sub 4} peaks at well defined temperatures (ranging from {approx} 60 to {approx} 340{degrees}C), accompanied by a negligible formation of ethane. No C{sub {gamma}} was formed. The total amount of adsorbed CH{sub 4} and the average H/C ratio of the corresponding adspecies can be derived from these experiments. In a separate set of experiments, CH{sub 4} is switched to H{sub 2} at the end of the exposure step, the temperature being fixed. An immediate formation of alkanes ranging from C{sub 1} to C{sub 6} is then evidenced. A sizeable fraction of the chemisorbed layer can so be homologated to higher alkanes. The influences of the various operating factors are reported. In particular a neat maximum of the C{sub 2+} production versus temperature (at 160{degrees}C) is evidenced and is clearly due to the adverse hydrogenolysis reactions, efficiently catalyzed by Ru. All the results can be interpreted in complete similarity with the Pt case. 5 refs., 16 figs., 3 tabs.","","","","","","United States","1996-06-01T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: Journal of Catalysis; Journal Volume: 161; Journal Issue: 1; Other Information: PBD: Jun 1996","","Medium: X; Size: pp. 282-291","","","","Journal ID: JCTLA5; ISSN 0021-9517; TRN: 97:000028-0028","10.1006/jcat.1996.0186","","2009-12-16T00:00:00Z","471625","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/471625","","Journal of Catalysis","1","161"

The feed was equimolar in {sup 13}C and {sup 12}C atoms. The products were analyzed by gas chromatography-mass spectrometry, allowing determination of the isotopic composition. While the methanol was completely or almost completely converted to hydrocarbons, the larger part of the propene emerged unreacted. The products ethen and butenes were mostly formed from methanol and contained a large excess of {sup 13}C atoms. The propene effluent consisted mainly of all- {sup 12}C or all-{sup 13}C molecules and, only to a small extent, isotopically mixed molecules. The tendency for propene to emerge unreacted and all new hydrocarbons to be formed from methanol became more pronounced with progressing catalyst deactivation. The results show that the higher hydrocarbons are, over this catalyst, not formed by successive methylations of bulk gas-phase propene. A previously proposed {open_quotes}carbon pool{close_quotes} mechanism can explain the gross effects seen in the product and isotopic distribution, but it is pointed out that the nonreactivity of propene in SAPO-34 may be caused by slow diffusion of propene in the pores. 16 refs., 5 figs., 4 tabs.","","","","","","United States","1996-06-01T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: Journal of Catalysis; Journal Volume: 161; Journal Issue: 1; Other Information: PBD: Jun 1996","","Medium: X; Size: pp. 304-309","","","","Journal ID: JCTLA5; ISSN 0021-9517; TRN: 97:000028-0030","10.1006/jcat.1996.0188","","2009-12-16T00:00:00Z","471627","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/471627","","Journal of Catalysis","1","161"

To show this, the influence of the nature of solvent on the reactivity and selectivity features of the large pore Ti-beta catalyst has been studied during the oxidation of 1-hexene and cyclohexanol, as representative substrates, using aqueous hydrogen peroxide as oxidant and under single liquid phase conditions. It has been shown that the reactivity of the medium pore TS-1 for 1-hexene oxidation was seen to be much higher in methanol (protic) than in acetonitrile (aprotic) solvent. These differences have been related to the hydrophilic character of Ti-beta, in contrast to the hydrophobic character of TS-1. The selectivities to the epoxide and to the ketone during 1-hexene and cyclohexanol oxidations, respectively, on Ti-beta were also highest in acetonitrile. This was associated to the poisoning of the Bronsted acid sites associated with framework aluminum by the basic acetonitrile molecules, thus avoiding acid-catalyzed secondary reactions. The different effects that solvents have on the catalytic properties of Ti-beta and TS-1 are of prime importance from the point of view of the application of these catalysts, since, as can be seen from this work, the optimum operating conditions would be quite different for both the Ti-beta and the TS-1 materials. 21 refs., 7 figs., 5 tabs.","","","","","","United States","1996-06-01T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: Journal of Catalysis; Journal Volume: 161; Journal Issue: 1; Other Information: PBD: Jun 1996","","Medium: X; Size: pp. 11-19","","","","Journal ID: JCTLA5; ISSN 0021-9517; CNN: Project MAT94-0359-C02-01; TRN: 97:000028-0002","10.1006/jcat.1996.0157","","2009-12-16T00:00:00Z","471600","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/471600","","Journal of Catalysis","1","161"

Oxidation of these carbon species to CO{sub 2} proceeds with an intrinsic activation energy of 63 kJ mol{sup {minus}1}, while hydrogenation of CH{sub 4} with an intrinsic activation energy of the order of 240 kJ mol{sup {minus}1}. On the other hand, dissociation of CO{sub 2} results in the formation of much lower quantities of carbon species under the same reaction conditions. In this case, two kinds of carbon species were identified. Hydrogenation of the main carbon species were identified species proceeds with an activation energy of 96 kJ mol{sup {minus}1}, while its oxidation proceeds with significantly different kinetics than the carbon derived from CH{sub 4} dissociation. Characterization of carbon accumulated on the catalyst surface during reforming reaction of CH{sub 4} with CO{sub 2} has also been performed. It was found that this carbon mostly originates from the CO{sub 2} molecule and it is significantly more reactive than the carbon derived from CH{sub 4} decomposition, but of similar reactivity as the carbon derived from CO{sub 2} dissociation. Temperature-programmed hydrogenation (TPH) experiments of the carbonaceous species formed during reforming reaction at 650{degrees}C revealed three different kinds of carbon species.

Aqueous impregnation (the mean of adding La{sup 3+}) of Co/SiO{sub 2} led to a significant decrease in the number of intermediates leading to methane during CO hydrogenation, but it did not alter the nature of the active sites. In a previous characterization paper (19)La{sup 3+} promotion of Co/SiO{sub 2} was shown to moderate the strong Co-support interactions brought about by aqueous impregnation of the Co/SiO{sub 2} and to enhance the reducibility of the Co oxide. La{sup 3+} addition to the Co/SiO{sub 2} catalyst was found to lead to a significant increase in the activity for Fischer-Tropsch synthesis (on a per gram Co basis). The SSITKA results showed that the concentration of active intermediates leading to methane increased with increase in La/Co ratio. However, the TOF, the pseudo-first-order rate constant, the reactivity distribution function, and the activation energy were not affected by La{sup 3+} addition. Thus, it can be concluded that La{sup 3+} did not change the nature of the active sites, just their concentration. This increase in the concentration of active sites follows exactly the increase in surface Co{sup 0}. La{sup 3+} promotion (La/Co{ge}0.1) also caused the chain growth probability and the olefin/paraffin ratio to increase significantly at 220{degrees}C and for H{sub 2}/CO=2. 34 refs., 5 figs., 3 tabs.","","","","","","United States","1996-06-01T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: Journal of Catalysis; Journal Volume: 161; Journal Issue: 1; Other Information: PBD: Jun 1996","","Medium: X; Size: pp. 274-281","","","AC22-92PC92108","Journal ID: JCTLA5; ISSN 0021-9517; TRN: 97:000028-0027","10.1006/jcat.1996.0185","","2009-12-16T00:00:00Z","471624","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/471624","","Journal of Catalysis","1","161"

The variation of the LII signal with gravimetrically measured soot volume fractions ranging from 0.078 to 1.1 ppm established the linearly of the calibration. With the high spatial and temporal resolution capabilities of LII, the spatial and temporal fluctuations of the soot field within a gravimetric chimney were characterized. Radial uniformity of the soot volume fraction, f{sub v}, was demonstrated with sufficient averaging of the single laser-shot LII images of the soot field thus confirming the validity of the calibration method for imaging applications.

Two types of adsorption isotherms are found for AlPO{sub 4}. The presence of vertical parts on the isotherms which are shifted to high pressures with increasing temperatures corresponds to the formation of adsorption complexes with Al atoms.","","","","","","United States","1996-05-10T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: Journal of Colloid and Interface Science; Journal Volume: 179; Journal Issue: 2; Other Information: PBD: 10 May 1996","","Medium: X; Size: pp. 374-379","","","","Journal ID: JCISA5; ISSN 0021-9797; TRN: IM9630%%186","10.1006/jcis.1996.0228","","2009-12-16T00:00:00Z","253735","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/253735","","Journal of Colloid and Interface Science","2","179"

While the conversion of CO to C{sub 2+} oxygenates over the double-bed configuration was comparable to that observed over the single Cu-based catalyst, major changes in the product distribution occurred by the coupling to the zinc chromite catalyst; i.e., the productivity of the C{sub 1}-C{sub 3} alcohols decreased dramatically and 2-methyl-branched alcohols were selectively formed. The desirable methanol/2-methyl oxygenates molar ratios close to 1 were obtained in the present double-bed system that provide the feedstock for the synthesis of high octane and high cetane ethers.","","","","","","United States","1996-05-01T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: Industrial and Engineering Chemistry Research; Journal Volume: 35; Journal Issue: 5; Other Information: PBD: May 1996","","Medium: X; Size: pp. 1534-1542","","","","Journal ID: IECRED; ISSN 0888-5885; TRN: IM9630%%203","10.1021/ie9505219","","2009-12-16T00:00:00Z","253752","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/253752","","Industrial and Engineering Chemistry Research","5","35"

The HCN reaction system was found to be highly sensitive to the catalyst microstructure because the authors observed activation and differences in performance on catalysts with different support materials. For CH{sub 4} ammoxidation on Pt monoliths they observe HCN yields >63% based on CH{sub 4} and NH{sub 3} fed which is comparable to yields obtained on commercially used Pt-10% Rh gauzes ({approximately}65%). With C{sub 2}H{sub 6} rather than CH{sub 4}, the authors achieve HCN yields of {approximately}42% (carbon and nitrogen basis). They also examined CH{sub 4}/C{sub 2}H{sub 6} mixtures (at fixed C/N and (C + N)/O{sub 2}) for HCN synthesis. HCN yields were found to decrease by 5--7% with increasing C{sub 2}H{sub 6} in the feed hydrocarbon mixture (up to 14%). Results for experiments with Pt-10%Rh gauzes used commercially are shown in all cases to allow comparisons with Pt monoliths. C{sub 2}H{sub 6} ammoxidation on Pt monoliths and gauzes at acetonitrile synthesis stoichiometries yields negligible amounts of higher nitriles (<0.01%), although HCN is produced on both. C{sub 2}H{sub 4} is the dominant product on the monoliths while CO is the dominant product on the gauze.","","","","","","United States","1996-05-01T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: Industrial and Engineering Chemistry Research; Journal Volume: 35; Journal Issue: 5; Other Information: PBD: May 1996","","Medium: X; Size: pp. 1524-1533","","","","Journal ID: IECRED; ISSN 0888-5885; TRN: IM9630%%202","10.1021/ie950520g","","2009-12-16T00:00:00Z","253751","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/253751","","Industrial and Engineering Chemistry Research","5","35"

Experiments were carried out using a Pd/{alpha}-Al{sub 2}O{sub 3} commercial catalyst and a simulated cracker gas mixture (H{sub 2}/C{sub 2}H{sub 2} = 50; 60% C{sub 2}H{sub 4}; 30% H{sub 2}, and traces of CO), at varying temperature (293--393 K) and pressure (2--35 atm). Competing mechanisms for acetylene and ethylene hydrogenation were formulated and the corresponding kinetic equations derived by rate-determining step methods. A criterion based upon statistical analysis was used to discriminate between rival kinetic models. The selected equations are consistent with the adsorption of C{sub 2}H{sub 2} and C{sub 2}H{sub 4} in the same active sites followed by reaction with adsorbed hydrogen atoms to form C{sub 2}H{sub 4} and C{sub 2}H{sub 6} in a one-step process. Good agreement between computed and experimental results was obtained using a nonisothermal reactor model that takes into account the existence of external temperature and concentration gradients.

The use of a reactor filled with molten metal has been proven for dissociating a wide range of organic, organometallic, metallic and inorganic wastes into their constituent elements. Such reactors allow users to manipulate the solution chemistry and operating conditions inside, to reconfigure the dissociated elements into useful products, such as synthesis gas (hydrogen and carbon monoxide), HCl, metal alloys and ceramics, while ensuring high levels of environmental performance. A commercial-scale, molten metal processing unit is being constructed at Hoechst Celanese Corp.`s Bay City, Tex., chemical manufacturing plant. The unit with an estimated capital cost of $25 million, will be constructed, owned and operated by Molten Metal Technology, Inc., and will use MMT`s Catalytic Extraction processing. Once online, the facility will process wastes from Hoechst Celanese`s Gulf Coast plants and from other nearby chemical manufacturers. In addition to processing wastes, the facility will generate a syngas product that will be used onsite as a raw material during chemical manufacturing.

The virial equation of state truncated after the second coefficient was used to calculate the vapor-phase fugacity coefficients. The Tsonopoulos correlation equation was applied to determine the second virial coefficients. Various activity coefficient models of the Wilson, the NRTL, and the UNIQUAC equations were used to correlate the binary experimental vapor-liquid equilibrium results. Optimally-fitted binary parameters of the activity coefficient models were obtained and those parameters of the NRTL model were employed to predict the ternary vapor-liquid equilibria. Satisfactory results were presented for the correlation and prediction of the vapor-liquid equilibrium data on binary and ternary mixtures.","","","","","","United States","1996-05-01T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: Journal of Chemical and Engineering Data; Journal Volume: 41; Journal Issue: 3; Other Information: PBD: May-Jun 1996","","Medium: X; Size: pp. 557-561","","","","Journal ID: JCEAAX; ISSN 0021-9568; TRN: IM9631%%108","10.1021/je950264e","","2009-12-16T00:00:00Z","256902","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/256902","","Journal of Chemical and Engineering Data","3","41"

The solubility of carbon monoxide in liquid methanol was measured by the decrease in pressure due to absorption at pressures up to 1,500 kPa and temperatures up to 140 C. The mole fraction solubility was between 4.2 {times} 10{sup {minus}4} and 11 {times} 10{sup {minus}3}, and the Henry`s law constants were about 250 MPa at temperatures lower than 80C and pressures up to 1,000 kPa. The diffusivity of CO gas in methanol was determined by measuring the diameter and solution time of a single CO bubble in methanol over the temperature range from 25C to 90 C at a pressure of 500 kPa. The diffusion coefficients ranged between 5 {times} 10{sup {minus}9} m{sup 2}/s and 9.5 {times} 10{sup {minus}9} m{sup 2}/s for the temperature range from 25 C to 90 C and increased as temperature increased.

Laser Doppler anemometry was used to measure radial and axial components of velocity in the flaming zones of a 31-cm-diameter methanol pool fire. Mean and rms values, correlation coefficients, turbulence scales, and autospectra of both components of velocity and compensated temperature are presented. Turbulent energy production, turbulent Reynolds and Prandtl numbers and other quantities of interest are given. Through the results, a consistent quantitative description of the fire flow field is developed, with much new information contained in the correlations and turbulence quantities. The temporal coupling between the formation and shedding of the characteristic large-scale structures in the fire, the air entrainment and the flapping flame fronts at the base of the fire is described through interpretation of the distributions of mean velocity, turbulence correlations and autospectra/ of velocity which are based on time averaged statistics. The flow is found to develop in a manner similar to a buoyant shear flow, but approaches classical shear flow behavior only in strongly entraining regions and in the thermal plume far above the fuel surface. High negative values of flux Richardson number suggest similarity to some aspects of large-scale environmental flows, while low values of turbulent Reynolds and Prandtl numbers are consistent with the notion of a rapidly developing, buoyancy-drive turbulent flow field.","","","","","","United States","1996-05-01T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: Combustion and Flame; Journal Volume: 105; Journal Issue: 3; Other Information: PBD: May 1996","","Medium: X; Size: pp. 245-266","","","","Journal ID: CBFMAO; ISSN 0010-2180; TRN: IM9629%%382","10.1016/0010-2180(95)00103-4","","2009-12-16T00:00:00Z","251069","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/251069","","Combustion and Flame","3","105"

Starting with a short mechanism involving 14 steps, five of which are reversible, sequentially reduced overall descriptions of four, three, and two steps are obtained by investigating the character of the departure of the H atom and its associated radicals from steady states and by demonstrating in agreement with earlier work that, contrary to hydrocarbon flames, water-gas equilibrium is an excellent approximation in the reaction zones of these methanol flames. The maximum temperature, that of the fuel-consumption zone, is calculated as a function of the rate of scalar dissipation at the stoichiometric mixture fraction, and extinction conditions are identified from the maximum of this scalar dissipation on the resulting C-shaped curve. Extinction diameters are calculated explicitly from these results for methanol droplets burning in oxygen-nitrogen mixtures initially at 300 K and at normal atmospheric and subatmospheric pressures. Absorption of water in the liquid methanol is verified to exert a large effect on extinction and is included in the analysis by treating the two limiting cases of time-dependent liquid-phase diffusion and perfect liquid-phase mixing, along with the quasisteady gas phase. It is found that the second of these limits is in better correspondence with existing experiments and that, for burning in air, typically between about 40% and 80% of the droplet mass is water at extinction. Reasonable agreement with previously reported extinction diameters, obtained from detailed time-dependent computations and from microgravity droplet-combustion experiments, is thereby achieved.","","","","","","United States","1996-05-01T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: Combustion and Flame; Journal Volume: 105; Journal Issue: 3; Other Information: PBD: May 1996","","Medium: X; Size: pp. 267-290","","","","Journal ID: CBFMAO; ISSN 0010-2180; TRN: IM9629%%383","10.1016/0010-2180(95)00207-3","","2009-12-16T00:00:00Z","251070","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/251070","","Combustion and Flame","3","105"

Heteropolyoxometalates are unique among metal-oxygen compounds in that they possess a molecular-type structure of discrete and thus well-defined composition; heteropolyoxometalates can, therefore, be rationally designed, synthesized, and characterized for use in catalysis. Their reactivity and selectivity can, in turn, be fine tuned, for example, by modifying their composition by incorporating alkali or transition metal ions.

"Spot market runup over; buyers anticipate soft summer","Morris, G D.L.","09 BIOMASS FUELS; 10 SYNTHETIC FUELS; METHANOL; PRICES; SUPPLY AND DEMAND","Spot methanol markets spiked to 38 cts/gal late last month as a result of planned and unplanned outages. Gulf Coast markets have already retreated from those highs, however, as traders and consumers anticipate more plentiful supply and lower prices by midsummer. May postings are likely to roll over at April levels of 37 cts-39 cts/gal, and late April notices that producers would no longer honor off-list discounts are being disregarded. The trigger for the price runup was a production snag a week before the recent fire at Hoechst Celanese`s Clear Lake, TX acetic acid plant. The company reports methanol is back on-line. In addition, Cytec`s Fortier, LA methanol plant is in a two-month turnaround, and Texaco`s Delaware City, DE plant has been shut. Methanex (Vancouver) was taking output from those two units and was said to be in the spot market along with Hoechst Celanese`s partner, Valero, which exacerbated the spike. Lyondell is just restarting methanol after a maintenance outage. Although Texaco says the Delaware City plant is off-line for six months, market watchers do not expect it to restart soon, based on its cost structure at current prices. Quantum was planning a two-month maintenance and expansion project at its Deer Park, TX methanol and acetic acid plant, but in light of the Hoechst Celanese acetic outage Quantum may delay that project. Midyear is the startup target for the new BP Sterling plant at Texas City, TX.","","","","","","United States","1996-05-01T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: Chemical Week; Journal Volume: 158; Journal Issue: 17; Other Information: PBD: 1 May 1996","","Medium: X; Size: pp. 24","","","","Journal ID: CHWKA9; ISSN 0009-272X; TRN: 97:000644-0001","","","2009-12-16T00:00:00Z","508304","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/508304","","Chemical Week","17","158"

The computations consider multi-component molecular transport and detailed chemical kinetics (19 species, 89 forward reactions) in the gas phase; semiempirically formulated vapor-liquid equilibrium with water vaporization/condensation at the liquid surface; and liquid species mass transfer and energy conservation in the liquid phase. The results are compared with previously reported data from microgravity drop tower, freely falling isolated droplet, and suspended droplet combustion experiments, all of which show significant departure from d{sup 2}-law burning behavior and/or substantial water accumulation in the liquid phase. The liquid mass Peclet number (defined as the ratio of the droplet surface regression velocity to the effective diffusion velocity of water within the liquid droplet) is greater than 20 for methanol burning in air. The numerical model predicts little or no water accumulation for such circumstances. However, numerical results are consistent with experiments when it is speculated that sufficient internal liquid phase motion is present to reduce the effect liquid mass Peclet number to the order of one. Such internal motion has been noted in droplet combustion experiments and most likely arises from droplet generation/deployment techniques and/or surface tension gradients. Calculations show that the droplet combustion characteristics of methanol/water mixtures of 0--50% initial water content are extremely sensitive to the liquid mass transport effects and might be used to better determine the magnitude of liquid mass transport present in microgravity experiments.","","","","","","United States","1996-04-01T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: Combustion and Flame; Journal Volume: 105; Journal Issue: 1-2; Other Information: PBD: Apr 1996","","Medium: X; Size: pp. 104-122","","","","Journal ID: CBFMAO; ISSN 0010-2180; TRN: IM9618%%356","10.1016/0010-2180(95)00179-4","","2009-12-16T00:00:00Z","215672","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/215672","","Combustion and Flame","1-2","105"

A kinetic model taking into account both the deactivation of the main and the secondary reactions and the influence of the intracrystalline diffusion has been developed. The best fit of the experimental data has been obtained assuming that gaseous hydrocarbons, formed mainly by ethylene, are the coke precursors. The secondary reactions of p-xylene dealkylation, toluene disproportionation, and external p-xylene isomerization deactivate faster than the main reaction, probably due to differences in the strength of the acid sites over which they take place. The paraselectivity corresponding to the primary product decreases with the time on stream as a consequence of the pore blockage by coke, which attenuates the diffusional control of the internal xylene isomerization. Methanol dehydration is the reaction least affected by coke.","","","","","","United States","1996-04-01T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: Industrial and Engineering Chemistry Research; Journal Volume: 35; Journal Issue: 4; Other Information: PBD: Apr 1996","","Medium: X; Size: pp. 1300-1306","","","","Journal ID: IECRED; ISSN 0888-5885; TRN: IM9625%%373","10.1021/ie9500836","","2009-12-16T00:00:00Z","238048","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/238048","","Industrial and Engineering Chemistry Research","4","35"

This material has a high ionic conductivity at low temperatures. On applying a direct current to the reaction cell, acrylaldehyde was formed at the gold anode, and the formation rate of acrylaldehyde increased linearly with increasing current density. The addition of oxygen to the propene-mixed gas at the anode space did not affect the acrylaldehyde production. Hence, it is likely that partial oxidation of propene was carried out by the oxygen species produced electrochemically through the electrolyte, and appearing at the gold-electrolyte gas-phase triple-phase boundary. From the dependence of the acrylaldehyde selectivity on the amount and the type of dopants, it was found that the complete oxidation of propene with lattice oxygen from the rare-earth-doped CeO{sub 2} surface was significant, and that the reactivity of lattice oxygen in CeO{sub 2} with hydrocarbons decreased with increasing ionic conduction of the oxide.","","","","USDOE","","United States","1996-04-01T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: Journal of the Electrochemical Society; Journal Volume: 143; Journal Issue: 4; Other Information: PBD: Apr 1996","","Medium: X; Size: pp. 1264-1268","","","","Journal ID: JESOAN; ISSN 0013-4651; TRN: IM9629%%371","10.1149/1.1836627","","2016-05-24T00:00:00Z","251058","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/251058","","Journal of the Electrochemical Society","4","143"

"Microsecond catalytic partial oxidation of alkanes","Goetsch, D A; Schmidt, L D","40 CHEMISTRY; 10 SYNTHETIC FUELS; ALKANES; OXIDATION","A single layer of woven platinum-10 percent rhodium gauze was used as a catalyst for the partial oxidation of ethane, propane, n-butane, and isobutane. This configuration produced oxygen conversions of equal to or greater than 90 percent and had high selectivity to olefins and oxygenated hydrocarbons at contact times as short as 10 microseconds at atmospheric pressure. This reactor operates by rapid chemical heating ({approximately}5 microseconds) followed by rapid quenching to avoid homogeneous reactions, which decompose products. Mixing of the cold unreacted gas passing between the gauze wires with the hot product gas results in rapid quenching ({approximately}200 microseconds) of the products from {approximately}800{degrees} to {approximately}400{degrees}C. The rapid quenching avoids successive homogeneous decomposition reactions of unstable products such as olefins and aldehydes but still allows homogeneous chain reactions that produce these species. The strong variations in products with the feed alkane showed that the reaction pathways operating at {approximately}10{sup {minus}5} seconds are quite different than those operating at longer residence times. These results could have a significant effect on the direct conversion of alkanes to oxygenates such as formaldehyde. 9 refs., 3 figs.","","","","USDOE","","United States","1996-03-15T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: Science; Journal Volume: 271; Journal Issue: 5255; Other Information: PBD: 15 Mar 1996","","Medium: X; Size: pp. 1560-1562","","","","Journal ID: SCIEAS; ISSN 0036-8075; TRN: 96:002048-0003","10.1126/science.271.5255.1560","","2016-05-23T00:00:00Z","285018","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/285018","","Science","5255","271"

The authors show that the extensive broadening of peaks where the h or l indices are odd is due to extended defects. These defects can be modeled as stacking faults perpendicular to the a and c axes. The proposed defects also explain the streaking effects observed by single crystal X-ray diffraction and by electron diffraction. One of the proposed defects can explain the presence of some V{sup 5+} in this phase. The amount of V{sup 5+} found both by titration and by {sup 31}P NMR spin echo mapping correlates well with defect concentration. The NMR studies also confirm that the V{sup 5+} present is associated with (VO){sub 2}P{sub 2}O{sub 7} rather than a second phase. The defects are most prominent in samples prepared to be optimum catalysts for the oxidation of n-butane to maleic anhydride.

The reactivity for methanol oxidation over the conventional bismuth-metal oxide catalysts was found to be primarily related to the surface area of the oxide catalysts and was essentially independent of the near surface composition and the bulk structure. The selectivity for methanol oxidation over the conventional bismuth-metal oxide catalysts was essentially found not to be a function of the surface area, the near surface composition, and the bulk structure. A series of model bismuth-metal oxide catalysts was synthesized by depositing metal oxides on the surface of a bismuth oxide support. The model studies demonstrated that two-dimensional metal oxide overlayers are not stable on the bismuth oxide support and readily react to form bulk bismuth-metal oxide compounds upon heating. Furthermore, the model studies revealed that these bulk bismuth-metal oxide compounds are related to the active sites for the partial oxidation reaction. In situ Raman spectroscopy in methanol/oxygen, methanol, and oxygen reaction environments with helium as the diluent revealed no additional information regarding the nature of the active site. It was found that only highly crystalline bismuth-metal oxide phases are selective for the partial oxidation of methanol to formaldehyde. Thus, selective bismuth-metal oxide catalysts will always possess highly crystalline metal oxide phases containing extremely low surface areas which make it difficult to obtain fundamental surface information about the outermost layers. 48 refs., 11 figs., 9 tabs.","","","","","","United States","1996-03-01T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: Journal of Catalysis; Journal Volume: 159; Journal Issue: 1; Other Information: PBD: Mar 1996","","Medium: X; Size: pp. 1-13","","","","Journal ID: JCTLA5; ISSN 0021-9517; TRN: 96:003197-0001","10.1006/jcat.1996.0058","","2009-12-16T00:00:00Z","264065","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/264065","","Journal of Catalysis","1","159"

The initial (5 min on stream) rates of propane conversion in the presence of iron- and manganese-promoted sulfated zirconia, sulfated zirconia, and USY zeolite at 450{degrees}C and 0.01 atm propane partial pressure were 3.3 X 10{sup -8}, 0.3 X 10{sup -8}, and 0.03 x 10{sup -8} mol/(s {sm_bullet} g), respectively.

"Silver-cluster formation on AgZr{sub 2}(PO{sub 4}){sub 3} and catalytic decomposition of butan-2-ol","Arsalane, S; Ziyad, M","40 CHEMISTRY; 10 SYNTHETIC FUELS; SILVER PHOSPHATES; CATALYTIC EFFECTS; ZIRCONIUM PHOSPHATES; BUTANOLS; DECOMPOSITION; KETONES; X-RAY DIFFRACTION; ABSORPTION SPECTROSCOPY; CATALYST SUPPORTS; DEHYDROGENATION; ATOMIC CLUSTERS; NUCLEAR MAGNETIC RESONANCE","A Nasicon-type AgZr{sub 2}(PO{sub 4}){sub 3} material was synthesized and its catalytic properties were characterized by butan-2-ol conversion in the presence and absence of oxygen. The catalytic activity was mainly oriented toward the production of methyl ethyl ketone and butenes. Activity was shown to depend on the reducibility of the Ag{sup +} ions and on the oxygen concentration in the reactants. Hydrogen, butan-2-ol, and butan-2-ol/O{sub 2} were able to reduce the Ag{sup +} cations located in the three-dimensional channels of the phosphate network. Silver clusters appeared on the surface and protons replaced the Ag{sup +} ions in the structure to form (HPO{sub 4}) acidic groups, without any modification in the framework of the phosphate. Evidence for this phenomenon was provided by (1) XRD peaks corresponding to (111) and (200) metallic silver diffractions, (2) UV-visible spectroscopy which showed conduction bands at 372 and 410 nm attributed to Ag{sup 0} crystallites and a shoulder in the 250-270 nm region due probably to (Ag{sub n}){sup {delta}+} charged clusters, (3) TEM analysis which revealed that the exposure of the phosphate to the electron beam produced a spontaneous appearance of silver particles, (4) IR spectroscopy which demonstrated the protonation of the sample by the appearance of three new hydroxyl bands in the 3000-3500 cm{sup -1} region, a result supported by {sup 1}HNMR spectroscopy, and (5) TPO experiments performed after the reduction of the sample which showed that silver clusters adsorb oxygen in at least two specific ways which are active in the oxidative dehydrogenation of the butan-2-ol. It was also shown that the formation of silver particles was reversible upon reoxidation at 773 K to give the starting material AgZr{sub 2}(PO{sub 4}){sub 3}. 26 refs., 10 figs., 1 tab.","","","","","","United States","1996-03-01T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: Journal of Catalysis; Journal Volume: 159; Journal Issue: 1; Other Information: PBD: Mar 1996","","Medium: X; Size: pp. 162-169","","","","Journal ID: JCTLA5; ISSN 0021-9517; TRN: 96:003197-0018","10.1006/jcat.1996.0075","","2009-12-16T00:00:00Z","263782","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/263782","","Journal of Catalysis","1","159"

The increase in the rate of C{sub 2}H{sub 4} oxidation is up to 20 times higher that the open-circuit (unpromoted) catalytic rate and at least a factor of 5000 higher than the rate of O{sup 2-} supply through the mixed conducting TiO{sub 2} support. The latter is and remains catalytically inert during electrical bias. This electrochemically induced Schwab effect of the second kind has all the same qualitative features with the effect of non-Faradaic electrochemical modification of catalytic activity (NEMCA effect) when using pure O{sup 2-} conductors. Work function measurements and X-ray photo-electron spectroscopic (XPS) investigation of the Pt catalyst surface under UHV conditions has also provided evidence consistent with the electrochemically controlled promoting oxide ion backspillover mechanism which is operative with NEMCA when using pure O{sup 2-} conductors. Under reaction conditions in atmospheric pressure or oxidizing environments in UHV the TiO{sub 2} support exhibits mixed electronic (n-type)-ionic conductivity and thus the catalyst work function and catalytic activity can be controlled by the applied potential. In reducing environments the electronic conductivity of TiO{sub 2} dominates and the catalyst work function remains constant upon application of potential. 44 refs., 18 figs.","","","","","","United States","1996-03-01T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: Journal of Catalysis; Journal Volume: 159; Journal Issue: 1; Other Information: PBD: Mar 1996","","Medium: X; Size: pp. 189-203","","","","Journal ID: JCTLA5; ISSN 0021-9517; TRN: 96:003197-0021","","","2009-12-16T00:00:00Z","263785","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/263785","","Journal of Catalysis","1","159"

A chlorine-catalyzed oxidative pyrolysis mechanism is used in the calculations, in which two mechanistic pathways to the C{sub 2} products were examined. One involves CH{sub 3}Cl and/or CH{sub 2}Cl, and the other involves C{sub 2}H{sub 6} and/or C{sub 2}H{sub 5} as reaction intermediates. Optimal control designs were performed with respect to the final mass fractions of ethylene and acetylene in a plug flow reactor using heat, oxygen, and chlorinate fluxes as controls. The simulation results show that for the temperatures (1,200 K < T < 1,900 K) and pressure (P = 1 atm) considered, C{sub 2}H{sub 4} is formed initially, which is subsequently converted to C{sub 2}H{sub 2}. Because of the abundant supply of H{sub 2} formed during the reaction, it is possible to reform C{sub 2}H{sub 4} from C{sub 2}H{sub 2} by controlled extraction of energy. The heat flux plays the most important role in determining the final concentration of the desired C{sub 2} products by controlling the temperature and the rate of H-atom radical generation, and thus, the interconversion between C{sub 2}H{sub 2} and C{sub 2}H{sub 4} through the C{sub 2}H{sub 3} radical. The solutions obtained, although not proven to be globally optimal, are of very high quality. More than 40% yield of the desired C{sub 2} products, either ethylene or acetylene, can be obtained in all cases.","","","","","","United States","1996-03-01T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: Industrial and Engineering Chemistry Research; Journal Volume: 35; Journal Issue: 3; Other Information: PBD: Mar 1996","","Medium: X; Size: pp. 683-696","","","","Journal ID: IECRED; ISSN 0888-5885; TRN: IM9621%%384","10.1021/ie940542n","","2009-12-16T00:00:00Z","225454","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/225454","","Industrial and Engineering Chemistry Research","3","35"

The visualization of formaldehyde distribution above a platinum plate in methanol premixed gas flows was carried out by a LIF (laser-induced fluorescence) method. Formaldehyde (CH{sub 2}O) has fluorescence spectra in the 340.6--493.3-nm range when it is excited by the third harmonic wavelength of Nd:YAG laser (355 nm). In this study, formaldehyde was excited by a pulse laser shot and the fluorescence at wavelength of 412.2 nm was selected for investigation. By this laser technique, the time resolved instantaneous distribution of formaldehyde on the platinum plate was successfully observed. The results show that the distribution of formaldehyde fluorescence is affected by gas velocity, catalyst temperature, and especially excess air ratio. The results correspond well with the results of a mathematical modeling for formaldehyde formation over Pt, and it confirms that this method is useful for analyzing the mechanism of catalytic combustion.","","","","USDOE","","United States","1996-03-01T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: Journal of Energy Resources Technology; Journal Volume: 118; Journal Issue: 1; Other Information: DN: Paper presented at the Thirteenth Annual Energy-Sources Technology Conference and Exhibition, New Orleans, LA (US), January 29--February 1, 1995; PBD: Mar 1996","","Medium: X; Size: pp. 82-87","","","","Journal ID: JERTD2; ISSN 0195-0738; TRN: IM9615%%341","10.1115/1.2792698","","2016-05-09T00:00:00Z","205561","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/205561","","Journal of Energy Resources Technology","1","118"

Individual spherical poly(styrene) particles, 47--355 {micro}m in diameter, burned in air at 1,050--1,400 K gas temperatures, surrounded by sooting, diffusion envelope flames. The pyrometric results were interpreted in view of two models for soot radiation: (a) a conventional model, which assumes that the flame is optically thin and isothermal and thus, the spectral emissivity is inversely proportional to the wavelength; (b) an alterative model, in which the envelope flames are assumed to be again optically thin but nonisothermal in the radial direction. For nonisothermal flames the spectral emissivity was shown to be nearly independent of the wavelength. This model in conjunction with 3-color pyrometry may provide a way of estimating the highest temperature of soot in the flame, as well as the temperature gradient across the flame. Temperatures calculated this way were higher by 200--230 K than those calculated using the conventional model. Experimental results suggest that the agreement among the three individual temperatures obtained from 3-color pyrometry depends on which of the above models for soot radiation is used. Based on the agreement between temperatures, the degree of isothermality of the flame may be determined and thus, indications about the controlling processes during combustion may be obtained.","","","","","","United States","1996-02-01T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: Combustion and Flame; Journal Volume: 104; Journal Issue: 3; Other Information: PBD: Feb 1996","","Medium: X; Size: pp. 272-287","","","","Journal ID: CBFMAO; ISSN 0010-2180; TRN: IM9618%%335","10.1016/0010-2180(95)00119-0","","2009-12-16T00:00:00Z","215651","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/215651","","Combustion and Flame","3","104"

The CS{sub 2} molecules are {eta}` bonded to Ru sites through one of the sulfur atoms and decompose to the constituent elements on thermal activation. Each S atom may deactivate 3 to 10 metal sites even at low coverages, the effect being more pronounced on the chemisorption of hydrogen. The deposited sulfur (and possibly carbon also) sterically hinders the formation of certain multicarbonyl and monocarbonyl species (vCO in 2055-2140 cm{sup -1} region), which otherwise transform to methane via surface methylene groups in the presence of chemisorbed hydrogen and are found to play an important role in the low-temperature methanation activity of the studied catalyst. The Ru-CO species giving rise to lower frequency vibrational bands are affected to a lesser extent. The presence of sulfur also results in the development of some new CO binding states which are weak and are identified with the CO and S coadsorbed at Ru sites of different oxidation states or of varying crystallographic nature.

The abundances, coverages, and lifetimes of surface intermediates of the reaction were measured under reaction conditions using isotopic transient kinetic analysis. The effects of temperature and partial pressure of H{sub 2} on these surface reaction parameters were also investigated. Activity distribution analysis showed that there were primarily two kinds of active methanation sites/intermediates (related to pools {alpha} and {beta}) as has previously been noted by a number of researchers. Cu preferentially blocked {alpha}-type sites. The surface abundance for pool {alpha} monotonically decreased with Cu loading while that for pool {beta} only decreased for Cu/Ru>0.1. Some additional low activity sites for methanation may have been generated with Cu addition due to (a) the spillover of H and CH{sub x} from Ru to Cu permitting reaction to occur on the Cu, or (b) the creation of {beta}-type sites at the Ru-Cu interfaces. The surface abundance of CO measured during the reaction suggests that (a) there was significant spillover of CO from Ru to Cu, and (b) Cu not only blocked the Ru surface but may have possibly caused some reconstruction of it. The surface abundance of intermediates was independent of H{sub 2} partial pressure in the range 18-55 kPa for all the catalysts. 30 refs., 15 figs., 9 tabs.","","","","","","United States","1996-02-01T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: Journal of Catalysis; Journal Volume: 158; Journal Issue: 2; Other Information: PBD: Feb 1996","","Medium: X; Size: pp. 511-520","","","","Journal ID: JCTLA5; ISSN 0021-9517; CNN: Grant CTS-9102960; TRN: 96:003799-0013","10.1006/jcat.1996.0050","","2009-12-16T00:00:00Z","263704","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/263704","","Journal of Catalysis","2","158"

Several factors motivated this extension. First, the measurements of Ref. 1 were limited to soot processes along the axes of laminar jet diffusion flames, where soot nucleates near the cool core of the flow and moves directly toward the flame sheet; therefore, it was of interest to consider other soot paths in order to investigate the generality of these results, especially for paths where soot nucleates near the flame sheet and initially moves toward more fuel-rich regions of the flow, which account for most of the soot production in buoyant diffusion flames. In particular, nucleation near the cool core of the flames generally is accompanied by observations of translucent objects but whether these objects are still observed for soot paths beginning at higher temperatures in the vicinity of the flame sheet must still be resolved. Secondly, measurements of hydrocarbons in Ref. 1 were limited to acetylene; therefore, information about the concentrations of other hydrocarbons is needed in order to establish their potential role in processes of soot formation within acetylene/air diffusion flames. Additionally, although several test flames were considered in Ref. 1, the available range of characteristic flame residence times (taken as the time for a fluid parcel to convect along the axis from the burner exit to the flame sheet) was rather narrow (17--23 ms); therefore, consideration of a broader range of flame conditions was of interest. Finally, a problem concerning measurements of O{sub 2} concentrations at fuel-rich conditions was discovered, motivating reconsideration of effects of soot oxidation rates on measurements of soot growth rates.","","","","","","United States","1996-02-01T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: Combustion and Flame; Journal Volume: 104; Journal Issue: 3; Other Information: PBD: Feb 1996","","Medium: X; Size: pp. 369-375","","","","Journal ID: CBFMAO; ISSN 0010-2180; TRN: IM9618%%340","10.1016/0010-2180(95)00225-1","","2009-12-16T00:00:00Z","215656","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/215656","","Combustion and Flame","3","104"

The catalyst produces radicals which react further through gas-phase reactions in the pores of the catalyst and in the interstitial phase. The reactor model accounts for the irreducible mass-transport limitations for the reactive radicals, which occur even at conditions where no mass-transport limitations occur for the molecules, both reactants and reaction products. The effects of these irreducible mass-transport limitations on the conversion and selectivity of the process were investigated and were found to be essential for an adequate description of experimental data.","","","","","","United States","1996-02-01T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: Industrial and Engineering Chemistry Research; Journal Volume: 35; Journal Issue: 2; Other Information: PBD: Feb 1996","","Medium: X; Size: pp. 415-421","","","","Journal ID: IECRED; ISSN 0888-5885; TRN: IM9617%%523","10.1021/ie9502852","","2009-12-16T00:00:00Z","212207","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/212207","","Industrial and Engineering Chemistry Research","2","35"

However, a selective catalyst is needed for this process to avoid the undesired complete oxidation reactions. Recently the authors developed a new catalyst that shows an overall olefin yield of more than 50 wt% once-through yields. This catalytic process shows some inherent advantages over steam cracking and direct catalytic processes. In the work discussed here, three catalytic systems considered to be most effective for oxidative dehydrogenation (ODH) of C{sub 2}-C{sub 4} paraffins were tested with an LPG mixture (25 wt% n-butane, 25 wt% isobutane, 50 wt% propane). The new catalyst (IV) containing RE-alkali-halogen-promoter (where RE is rare earth metal) was developed to achieve a similar olefin yield at higher weight-hourly space velocity (WHSV) and use steam as a diluent. Kinetic measurements and reactor modeling under adiabatic conditions were performed for this catalyst. Preliminary process design illustrates the potential of this catalyst for application to produce olefins by oxidative dehydrogenation.","","","","","","United States","1996-02-01T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: CHEMTECH; Journal Volume: 26; Journal Issue: 2; Other Information: PBD: Feb 1996","","Medium: X; Size: pp. 24-29","","","","Journal ID: CHTEDD; ISSN 0009-2703; TRN: IM9617%%536","","","2009-12-16T00:00:00Z","212220","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/212220","","CHEMTECH","2","26"

Activated carbon was impregnated with a metal halide, and adsorption and desorption characteristics of CO on the carbon were measured by fixed-bed runs. It was found that the impregnation of PdCl{sub 2} or CuCl effectively increases CO absorption. PdCl{sub 2}/CuCl-impregnated carbons were characterized by N{sub 2} adsorption, SEM, EPMA, and XPS. Adsorption isotherms of CO were also measured on these carbons, and the influence of the loading of impregnant on CO adsorption was experimentally elucidated. A selection procedure of impregnant was proposed based on the frontier orbital theory. The perturbation energy for molecular orbital mixing was estimated by the HOMO-LUMO interaction. CO adsorption on impregnated carbons was qualitatively interpreted using the perturbation energy, and the energy was regarded as an index of impregnant selection.","","","","","","United States","1996-02-01T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: AIChE Journal; Journal Volume: 42; Journal Issue: 2; Other Information: PBD: Feb 1996","","Medium: X; Size: pp. 422-430","","","","Journal ID: AICEAC; ISSN 0001-1541; TRN: IM9617%%512","10.1002/aic.690420212","","2009-12-16T00:00:00Z","212196","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/212196","","AIChE Journal","2","42"

The steady-state kinetic results for carbon formation can be explained by a model previously used for carbon formation in pure CO gas, but modified to take into account the influence of hydrogen. Comparisons between the results for Ni/SiO{sub 2}, Ni{sub 0.99}Cu{sub 0.01}/SiO{sub 2}, and Ni{sub 0.75}Cu{sub 0.25}/SiO{sub 2} show that the specific rate of carbon formation is increased when 1 at.% of Cu is added to a nickel catalyst, but that the rate decreases when the Cu content is increased to 10 at.%, and that no carbon formation is seen for the Ni{sub 0.75}Cu{sub 0.25}/SiO{sub 2} catalyst. The addition of a small amount of Cu, on the other hand, decreases the methanation rate while at higher Cu contents the rate goes up again and a maximum is observed at about 7 at.% Cu. Thus a simple ensemble model cannot explain the influence of copper on the rate of carbon formation or methanation. Comparison of carbon formation and methanation rates for the Ni/SiO{sub 2} and the Ni{sub 0.99}Cu{sub 0.01}/SiO{sub 2} catalysts indicates that the two reactions have different rate-controlling steps and that the carbon formation influences the methanation rate mainly through poisoning of the catalysts. 27 refs., 9 figs., 5 tabs.","","","","","","United States","1996-02-01T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: Journal of Catalysis; Journal Volume: 158; Journal Issue: 2; Other Information: PBD: Feb 1996","","Medium: X; Size: pp. 402-410","","","","Journal ID: JCTLA5; ISSN 0021-9517; TRN: 96:003799-0004","10.1006/jcat.1996.0041","","2009-12-16T00:00:00Z","263695","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/263695","","Journal of Catalysis","2","158"

The reactions are independent of the solvents used: benzene, toluene, dichloromethane, chloroform, acetone, and in the alcohols themselves. Aromatic alcohols gave better yields than aliphatic. Reactions between two different alcohols could also be used to prepare unsymmetric ethers, the best yields being obtained when one of the alcohols is aromatic alcohols proceeding in better yield. When primary (secondary) amines were used as the limiting reagent, direct amination of alcohols catalyzed by MTO gave good yields of the expected secondary (tertiary) amines at room temperature. Disproportionation of alcohols to alkanes and carbonyl compounds was also observed for aromatic alcohols in the presence of MTO. On the basis of the results of this investigation and a comparison with the interaction between MTO and water, a concerted process and a mechanism involving carbocation intermediates have been suggested. 5 tabs.","","","","","","United States","1996-01-12T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: Journal of Organic Chemistry; Journal Volume: 61; Journal Issue: 1; Other Information: PBD: 12 Jan 1996","","Medium: X; Size: pp. 324-328","","","","Journal ID: JOCEAH; ISSN 0022-3263; TRN: 96:001904-0005","10.1021/jo951613a","","2009-12-16T00:00:00Z","427057","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/427057","","Journal of Organic Chemistry","1","61"

Soot induction times and rates of soot formation were measured at 632.8 and 1,152.0 nm by a laser beam attenuation method and these showed an Arrhenius dependence on shock temperature. Soot yields and soot amounts were also measured. The soot yield and amount were found to decrease with the addition of methanol and ethanol to toluene, with more pronounced effects for the methanol addition. The addition of oxygen to toluene strongly suppressed soot with a shift of the soot yield to lower temperatures. This laser effect was not found during alcohol addition to the toluene and therefore an alternative route to the soot formation at lower temperatures is suggested. A kinetic model was used to interpret the experimental trends and reasonably reproduced the experimental observations. However, the lack of good quantitative agreement emphasized the urgent need in establishing reliable kinetic data and reaction pathways on the oxidation of the benzyl radical and PAH species.","","","","","","United States","1996-01-01T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: Combustion and Flame; Journal Volume: 104; Journal Issue: 1-2; Other Information: PBD: Jan 1996","","Medium: X; Size: pp. 51-65","","","","Journal ID: CBFMAO; ISSN 0010-2180; TRN: IM9618%%375","10.1016/0010-2180(95)00004-6","","2009-12-16T00:00:00Z","215691","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/215691","","Combustion and Flame","1-2","104"

In organic electrosynthesis, a key property, having implications for the economics of all membrane-divided cell processes, is the resistance of the membrane to the transport of neutral organic molecules. Moreover, an analogous problem is recognized in methanol fuel cells where diffusion of the fuel through the ionic polymer adversely influences performance. The transport of formaldehyde and ethylene glycol through modern fluorinated membranes is discussed. For a cell configuration proposed for the electrosynthesis of ethylene glycol from formaldehyde, both reactant and product pass through the membranes investigated at a rate of 1 to 2 mol/m h; this is clearly unacceptable and highlights the need for the development of alternative membranes or design of undivided cell processes for organic electrosynthesis. The paper reports the influence of temperature, current density, and type of membrane on the rate of transport, and it is concluded that the direction and magnitude of the flux of water through the membrane has a strong effect on the transport of the organics.","","","","USDOE","","United States","1996-01-01T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: Journal of the Electrochemical Society; Journal Volume: 143; Journal Issue: 1; Other Information: PBD: Jan 1996","","Medium: X; Size: pp. 175-178","","","","Journal ID: JESOAN; ISSN 0013-4651; TRN: IM9613%%379","10.1149/1.1836404","","2016-05-27T00:00:00Z","201402","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/201402","","Journal of the Electrochemical Society","1","143"

It was found that the surface coverage of active carbon-containing species, which are found in the reaction pathway to CO formation, is of the order of 0.2 over the Rh/Al{sub 2}O{sub 3} catalyst, while it is very small ({theta}{sub c}, < 0.02) over Rh/YSZ. The surface coverage of active oxygen-containing species which lead to the formation of CO is found to be very small over both Rh/Al{sub 2}O{sub 3} and Rh/YSZ catalysts. However, over the Rh/YSZ catalyst it was found that there exists a large reservoir of lattice oxygen species of the carrier which interact reversibly with gaseous CO{sub 2} under reforming reaction conditions. A spillover of these lattice oxygen species onto the Rh surface seems to occur, contributing to the formation of CO and H{sub 2}O.

Such a distribution is unselective toward middle distillates for all possible chain growth probabilities. Chain-length-dependent secondary reactions, however, cause deviations from the ASF-type distribution and can thus be used to improve the selectivity to the desired product range. To investigate secondary reactions the authors set out to study FT synthesis on flat model catalysts, a cobalt foil and cobalt particles on a SiO{sub 2} wafer, allowing a much better definition of the experiments than porous ones. On a Co foil olefin hydrogenation is the main chain-length-dependent secondary reaction, causing an exponential increase in the paraffin-to-olefin ratio with carbon number, but not resulting in a deviation from the ASF distribution. On Co/SiO{sub 2} model catalysts chain-length-dependent reinsertion of {alpha}-olefins into the chain growth process is the main secondary reaction, causing an increase of the growth probability with chain length. To a lesser extent, hydrogenolysis also plays a role, shortening long hydrocarbons by successive demethylation. On Co/SiO{sub 2} the interplay of chain-length-dependent reinsertion and hydrogenolysis results in sigmoid product distributions with a high selectivity to middle distillates. These product distributions can be fitted with a simple model in which a chain growth reaction is combined with chain-length-dependent secondary hydrogenation, reinsertion, and hydrogenolysis. 95 refs., 6 figs., 1 tab.","","","","","","United States","1996-01-01T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: Journal of Catalysis; Journal Volume: 158; Journal Issue: 1; Other Information: PBD: Jan 1996","","Medium: X; Size: pp. 288-300","","","","Journal ID: JCTLA5; ISSN 0021-9517; TRN: 96:001881-0028","10.1006/jcat.1996.0028","","2009-12-16T00:00:00Z","223990","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/223990","","Journal of Catalysis","1","158"

It has been reported that oxygenates were formed in the oxidation of pentane over VPO, 12-molybdophosphoric acid, vanadomolybdophosphates, and vanadium-substituted molybdophosphoric acid. In particular, both maleic anhydride and phthalic anhydride were formed with high selectivities on VPO, whereas maleic anhydride was formed on the heteropoly acids.

The initial intrinsic activity and rate of deactivation of Rh were also found to be sensitive to the metal particle size, in the range 1 - 6 nm. Both activity and rate of deactivation were found to decrease with increasing metal particle size. However, the degree of these dependences was found to be largely affected by the nature of the carrier, suggesting that the dependence of activity and rate of deactivation on metal particle size is likely to be related to metal-support interactions. While relatively high deactivation rates were observed over Rh supported on TiO{sub 2} and MgO, lower deactivation rates were observed over Rh supported on YSZ, Al{sub 2}O{sub 3}, La{sub 2}O{sub 3}, and SiO{sub 2}. Evidence was found that at least three kinds of factors contribute to catalyst deactivation, namely, carbon deposition, metal sintering, and poisoning of surface Rh sites by species originating from the carrier. The importance of each of these factors was found to be determined by the nature of the carrier. 36 refs., 9 figs., 3 tabs.","","","","","","United States","1996-01-01T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: Journal of Catalysis; Journal Volume: 158; Journal Issue: 1; Other Information: PBD: Jan 1996","","Medium: X; Size: pp. 51-63","","","","Journal ID: JCTLA5; ISSN 0021-9517; CNN: Contract JOU2-CT92-0073; TRN: 96:001881-0005","10.1006/jcat.1996.0005","","2009-12-16T00:00:00Z","223967","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/223967","","Journal of Catalysis","1","158"

The fresh and used catalysts have been characterized through a battery of instrumental techniques aiming at finding the relationship among the operating conditions, activity, and stability of the reacting system. The fresh catalysts are made up of a mixture of crystalline MgO and MgMO{sub 2} (M = Ni or Co) while the used ones also contain NiO and CoO. This explains the on-stream activation of the solid in terms of an in situ reduction of the oxides to generate the metallic centers needed to catalyze the reforming reaction. Under some of the experimental conditions employed, the SEM micrographs of the used solids show coke formation in whiskers. These will be burnt in the oxidizing zone of the fluidized bed, thus releasing Ni particles, which may be deposited on the freeboard walls. These metallic particles can catalyze back reactions, decreasing the overall yield to the desired reaction products, CO and H{sub 2}. 21 refs., 7 figs., 3 tabs.","","","","","","United States","1996-01-01T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: Journal of Catalysis; Journal Volume: 158; Journal Issue: 1; Other Information: PBD: Jan 1996","","Medium: X; Size: pp. 83-91","","","","Journal ID: JCTLA5; ISSN 0021-9517; CNN: Project PB93-0311; TRN: 96:001881-0008","10.1006/jcat.1996.0008","","2009-12-16T00:00:00Z","223970","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/223970","","Journal of Catalysis","1","158"

The SEM micrographs indicate that the {alpha}-alumina is crystalline with a well-defined plane exposed and that the Ag covers the support surface uniformly as a thin film. The EDS data also support the assertion that both surfaces are fairly uniform with regard to composition. ISS data exhibit features due to many contaminants such as C, N, Ca, and Ni on the {alpha}-alumina, as well as Na and Si binder materials which are also observed with AES and XPS. The XPS chemical-state data for the O, Al, Na, C, and Ag are complex, indicating that multiple chemical states of each element are present. Apparently, Ag is present predominantly as AgO, but Ag{sub 2}O and Ag metal are also present. 20 refs., 8 figs., 1 tab.","","","","","","United States","1996-01-01T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: Journal of Catalysis; Journal Volume: 158; Journal Issue: 1; Other Information: PBD: Jan 1996","","Medium: X; Size: pp. 109-115","","","","Journal ID: JCTLA5; ISSN 0021-9517; CNN: Grant CTS-9122575; TRN: 96:001881-0012","10.1006/jcat.1996.0012","","2009-12-16T00:00:00Z","223974","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/223974","","Journal of Catalysis","1","158"
"A microkinetic analysis of the water-gas shift reaction under industrial conditions","Ovesen, C V; Clausen, B S; Steffensen, G","40 CHEMISTRY; 01 COAL, LIGNITE, AND PEAT; 10 SYNTHETIC FUELS; WATER GAS PROCESSES; CHEMICAL REACTION KINETICS; COPPER; CATALYTIC EFFECTS; ALUMINIUM OXIDES; SILICA; ZINC OXIDES; CATALYST SUPPORTS; CHEMICAL PREPARATION; HYDROGENATION; TEMPERATURE DEPENDENCE; X-RAY SPECTROSCOPY","To form the basis for a microkinetic understanding of the low-temperature water-gas shift reaction over Cu-based catalysts as operated industrially, the kinetics have been measured under a wide range of reaction conditions. To elucidate possible support effects the reaction was studied over catalysts of Cu supported on Al{sub 2}O{sub 3}, SiO{sub 2}, or mixed ZnO/Al{sub 2}O{sub 3}. The proposed microkinetic model is based on a {open_quotes}surface redox{close_quotes} mechanism deduced from Cu single-crystal studies. All the input data for the elementary steps were taken from available Cu single-crystal studies and the total number of sites was the only free parameter in the microkinetic analysis. It was found to be important especially at high pressure to include in the mechanism the synthesis and hydrogenation of formate. The different dependencies of the overall kinetics have also been evaluated by a power law kinetic model, which was found to give an excellent representation of the kinetic data. It is seen that in spite of the severe constraints placed on the microkinetic model it could account for many of the important kinetic dependencies of the industrial water-gas shift reaction over the different Cu-based catalysts. Furthermore, the deduced number of active sites agrees well with the initial Cu surface area of the reduced catalysts determined separately by H{sub 2}-TPD suggesting that the model is also satisfactory for describing quantitatively the magnitude of the rates. Thus, a good starting point in interpreting the water-gas shift kinetics is to consider the catalysis occurring solely on the metallic Cu particles in the catalysts. The nature of the support may, however, have important secondary roles. For example, dynamic restructuring of the Cu particles may take place by changing the synthesis conditions and may depend on the nature of the support, as recently evidenced in separate EXAFS experiments. 32 refs., 9 figs., 8 tabs.","","","","","","United States","1996-01-01T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: Journal of Catalysis; Journal Volume: 158; Journal Issue: 1; Other Information: PBD: Jan 1996","","Medium: X; Size: pp. 170-180","","","","Journal ID: JCTLA5; ISSN 0021-9517; TRN: 96:001881-0016","10.1006/jcat.1996.0016","","2009-12-16T00:00:00Z","223978","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/223978","","Journal of Catalysis","1","158"

Chromia supported on the mixed oxide (Si:Ti mole ratio = 0.36) prepared from TEOS intercalated crystalline titanate is the most active among these chromia supported mixed oxide catalysts. The isobutylene yield of this catalyst was about 60% of girdler G-41 catalyst, comparable to that of the in-house chromia/{gamma}-alumina catalyst, 2 times as much as that of the chromia/titania catalyst, and 6 times as much as that of the chromia/silica catalyst.","","","","","","United States","1996-01-01T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: Industrial and Engineering Chemistry Research; Journal Volume: 35; Journal Issue: 1; Other Information: PBD: Jan 1996","","Medium: X; Size: pp. 47-53","","","","Journal ID: IECRED; ISSN 0888-5885; TRN: IM9608%%392","10.1021/ie950205u","","2009-12-16T00:00:00Z","183023","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/183023","","Industrial and Engineering Chemistry Research","1","35"

Two different plant sizes were considered, and the effect of 30% lower feedback prices on profitability was studied. It was found that the raw materials cost is a dominant component, composing about 55% of the total production cost. An internal rate of return of 19% could be realized for 500,000 tons per annum MTBE complex based on economic data in mid-1993.

The catalyst was mechanically and catalytically stable, but its fluidizability was limited; agglomeration and channeling occurred. The highest C{sub 2+} yield amounted to 18.0% (X{sub CH{sub 4}} = 36.5%, S{sub C{sub 2+}} = 49.4%) and 17.2% (X{sub CH{sub 4}} = 36.6%, S{sub C{sub 2+}} = 46.9%) for the diluted and undiluted feed, respectively. These yields are among the highest ones reported in the open literature for oxidative coupling of methane in fluidized beds. In the whole investigated temperature range higher selectivities and yields were obtained upon reducing partial pressures of methane and oxygen but keeping their ratio constant (p{sub CH{sub 4}}/p{sub O{sub 2}} = 2.5). An increased gas velocity or bed height resulted in a drop of C{sub 2+} selectivity.","","","","","","United States","1996-01-01T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: Industrial and Engineering Chemistry Research; Journal Volume: 35; Journal Issue: 1; Other Information: PBD: Jan 1996","","Medium: X; Size: pp. 54-61","","","","Journal ID: IECRED; ISSN 0888-5885; TRN: IM9608%%393","10.1021/ie950145s","","2009-12-16T00:00:00Z","183024","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/183024","","Industrial and Engineering Chemistry Research","1","35"
