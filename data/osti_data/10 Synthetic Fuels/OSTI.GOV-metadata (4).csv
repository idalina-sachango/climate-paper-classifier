The interaction of methanol and its oxidation products (i.e., formaldehyde, dimethoxymethane, formic acid, and methyl formate) is studied by FR-IR spectroscopy and compares with the results of flow reactor measurements performed at different temperatures, contact times, and methanol/oxygen molar feed ratios. The data are interpreted on the basis of a reaction mechanism which involved the following steps: (i) condensation of methanol with surface VOH groups; (ii) H abstraction from methoxy groups leading to coordinated formaldehyde; (iii) formation of dioxymethylene species by interaction of adsorbed formaldehyde with nucelophilic sites; (iv) reaction of dioxymethylene species with methanol to give dimethoxymethane; (v) successive oxidation of dioxymethylene groups to formate ions; (vi) reaction of these ions either with methanol to produce methyl formate or with water to give formic acid; (vii) decomposition of formate species to produce carbon monoxide; (viii) parallel oxidation of methanol to carbon dioxide. The behaviors of the surface species are compared with those monitored on other systems and the catalyst requirements for the title reaction are discussed.","","","Universita Fiera del Mare, Genova, Italy","","","United States","1987-09-24T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: J.

C/sub 3//C/sub 4/ olefin sources, fluid catalytic cracking (FCC), steam crackers, and dehydrogenation of C/sub 3//C/sub 4/ paraffins, all contain these undesirable polyunsaturated compounds. Hydrogenation of these compounds in alkylation unit feeds can also improve the economics of the alkylation process. Production of high-purity mono-olefins for downstream polyolefins production requires a feedstock that is essentially free of dienes and acetylenes to minimize undesirable side reactions. Although alkylation units can tolerate some diolefins in the feed, economics dictate that these diolefins should be minimized. The selective hydrogenation process (SHP) developed by others at its Marl, West Germany, plant, has undergone additional development work since commercialization of the process in 1980. The unit was designed to feed 160,000 metric tons/year of clean C/sub 4/ raffinate from a steam cracker, with a maximum polyunsaturated content of 0.8 wt%.","","","","","","United States","1988-12-05T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: Oil Gas J.; (United States); Journal Volume: 86:49","","Medium: X; Size: Pages: 40-43","","","","Journal ID: CODEN: OIGJA","","","2009-12-17T00:00:00Z","6467372","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/6467372","","Oil Gas J.; (United States)","","86:49"

Variations in the acidity were achieved by doping of the alumina with sodium and were measured by temperature-programmed desorption (TPD) of ammonia. An active catalytic coke was formed on the alumina during reaction. In order to determine the degree of condensation, crystallinity, and characteristics of the functional groups responsible for the catalytic activity of the active coke, analyses were conducted by oxidation at programmed temperature (TPO), X-ray transmission, and electronic paramagnetic resonance (EPR). Changes in the C/H/O ratio of the coke, estimated by quantitative organic analysis, produce changes in the catalytic activity and in the styrene yield. The evidence of the presence of oxygenated species in the coke and the participation of this oxygen in oxidative dehydrogenation suggested a redox-type reaction mechanism.","","","Instituto de Investigaciones en Tecnologia Quimica, INTEQUI, San Luis (AR)","","","United States","1988-12-01T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: Ind.

The discharges occurred between tungsten electrodes spaced 2.4-8.2 mm apart and were produced by a microsecond high-voltage trigger to cause breakdown, delivering energies on the order of 1 mJ, followed by a low-voltage sustainer of duration variable up to 2 ms, delivering energies up to 500 mJ. Of the nine phenomena identified as potential contributors to the droplet impulse, when there was no perceptible gap between the droplet surface and the initial spark the most important was the pressure imposed on one side of the droplet by the initial shock. When a perceptible gap between the initial spark and the droplet surface was evident, in addition to this pressure effect, the most important contributors to the droplet impulse were the drag caused by the flow behind the initial shock and by the flow of the cold gas ahead of the expanding spark kernel. From the simplified theoretical models that were developed and the measurements that were made, these phenomena were found to produce droplet velocity increments of orders of magnitude ranging from 10/sup -3/ to 10/sup 2/ mm/s. The impulses were established to be due predominantly to the trigger. Electrostatic phenomena were found to produce comparable velocity increments if the prebreakdown field durations were sufficiently long or if breakdown did not occur. The results are of use for reducing spark-induced droplet perturbations in design of experiments on droplet combustion.","","","","","","United States","1988-12-01T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: Combust.

Methanol products are primarily aliphatic hydrocarbon gases and C{sub 1} to C{sub 4} aliphatic substituents on the aromatic ring. Methylation of benzene to produce toluene increases as the feed ratio of methanol/benzene decreases. Mild conditions minimize aromatic ring production from methanol. Molar distribution of the methylene group (-CH{sub 2}-) in the product, is tabulated according to carbon number. Methane plus methyl substituents on the aromatic ring measure C{sub 1}; ethane, ethylene, and ethyl ring substituents measure C{sub 2}, etc. At temperatures up to 325 C, methylene distribution in the product is methyl = ethyl > propyl {much gt} butyl. Above 350 C, methyl {much gt} ethyl > propyl. This distribution of the methylene group, under mild conditions, may be a measure of the early production of light olefins, from methanol, within the zeolite pores.","","","","","","United States","1988-12-01T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: Journal of Catalysis; (USA); Journal Volume: 114:2","","Medium: X; Size: Pages: 271-276","","","","Journal ID: ISSN 0021-9517; CODEN: JCTLA","10.1016/0021-9517(88)90030-9","","2016-05-24T00:00:00Z","6960432","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/6960432","","Journal of Catalysis; (USA)","","114:2"

In particular Ertl and co-workers have demonstrated the strongly anisotropic nature of nitrogen adsorption on well-defined Fe single-crystal surfaces. Thus the (111) plane is by far the most active for such dissociation, a property thought to be due to the presence of exposed seven-coordinated Fe atoms in this surface. The trend in the efficiency of nitrogen dissociation on these planes has been shown by Spencer et al. to parallel their activity for ammonia synthesis under kinetically limited conditions; thus the (111) plane shows 400 times the activity of the relatively smooth (110) surface. Ertl et al. have also investigated the effects of the presence of alkali metal on the nitrogen adsorption kinetics and have found that the main effect on the energetics is an increase in the heat of adsorption of molecular nitrogen, and a consequent reduction in the energy barrier to dissociation at the surfaces. They then postulate that the effect of promotion in industrial ammonia synthesis is to bring all planes to a similar activity (1b), with the (111) plane being least affected and the (110) being the most affected. The purpose of the present paper is to present data from the kinetic modeling of ammonia synthesis using the data derived by Ertl et al. and to examine whether the thesis described above regarding promoter action is correct.","","","","","","United States","1988-12-01T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: Journal of Catalysis; (USA); Journal Volume: 114:2","","Medium: X; Size: Pages: 457-459","","","","Journal ID: ISSN 0021-9517; CODEN: JCTLA","10.1016/0021-9517(88)90049-8","","2016-05-20T00:00:00Z","6956767","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/6956767","","Journal of Catalysis; (USA)","","114:2"
"Droplet size and equivalence ratio effects on spark ignition of monodisperse n-heptane and methanol sprays","Danis, A M; Namer, I; Cernansky, N P","10 SYNTHETIC FUELS; 37 INORGANIC, ORGANIC, PHYSICAL AND ANALYTICAL CHEMISTRY; DROPLETS; SIZE; HEPTANE; COMBUSTION PROPERTIES; METHANOL; EQUIVALENCE PRINCIPLE; IGNITION SYSTEMS; SPARK IGNITION ENGINES; ALCOHOLS; ALKANES; ENGINES; HEAT ENGINES; HYDROCARBONS; HYDROXY COMPOUNDS; INTERNAL COMBUSTION ENGINES; ORGANIC COMPOUNDS; PARTICLES; 090210* - Alcohol Fuels- Properties- (1976-1989); 400800 - Combustion, Pyrolysis, & High-Temperature Chemistry","The effects of the droplet size and the equivalence ratio on the ignition of monodisperse n-heptane and methanol sprays at atmospheric pressure were investigated using a capacitive discharge spark ignition system. The minimum ignition energy E/sub min/ of the sprays was measured over a range of droplet diameters, D = 30-57 m, and equivalence ratios, phi = 0.44-1.8. As expected, results showed that E/sub min/ decreased with decreasing droplet size, with increasing equivalence ratio, and with increasing fuel volatility. While the same trends have been observed previously for polydisperse sprays, this is the first study to quantify these effects for monodisperse sprays in this size range. The minimum ignition energy was also measured for fully prevaporized n-heptane and methanol. An optimum gas phase equivalence ratio for prevaporized n-heptane ignition was found between 1.5 < phi < 2.0. No corresponding optimum was obtained for prevaporized methanol due to difficulties in generating fuel-rich methanol mixtures. Comparison of the spray and prevaporized ignition results indicated the existence of an optimum droplet size, D < 30 m, for the ignition of fuel-lean sprays for both fuels. Extension of the lean prevaporized ignition limit phi = 0.55, was also observed for all sprays. Experimental ignition results were compared to the predictions of two existing ignition models for quiescent sprays: the characteristic time model for ignition, and the general ignition model. Both models, using a characteristic time approach, predicted the experimentally determined ignition energies accurately for most conditions. Model performance deteriorated, however, for leaner ratios, phi < 0.7, and for smaller droplet size, D < 35 m, with both models increasingly underpredicting E/sub min/.","","","","","","United States","1988-12-01T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: Combust.

For each data point, five different values of reactedness are calculated from the measured temperature and the mass fractions of CH/sub 4/, O/sub 2/, H/sub 2/O and CO/sub 2/. These data are then sampled with respect to five ranges of mixture fraction and the conditional single and joint probability density functions (PDFs) of reactedness calculated from the various reactive scalars are presented for each range. Conditional means and root mean squares (rms) of fluctuations of reactedness, temperature, and species mass fractions are also presented. It is found that for mixture fraction ranges lying below the rich reaction limit, xi < xi/sub R/ (xi/sub R/ = 0.087 for methane) combustion is generally bimodal and fluid samples are either fully burned or unburned. For ranges with xi > xi/sub R/, the majority of mixtures are partially reacted and the conditional PDFs have centered distributions. The correlation between the conditional PDFs of various reactive scalars indicate that more than a single-step reaction mechanism is required to adequately describe the chemistry. Close to extinction, the flame was kept alight by fully burned pockets of fluid that provide a source of reignition for mixtures with slower mixing rates. The flame blows off when the frequency of occurrence of these pockets becomes small.","","","","","","United States","1988-12-01T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: Combust.

The selectivity for hydrocarbon products also increases with CO conversion. The product alcohols do not undergo a significant degree of secondary reaction at the concentrations formed under these conditions. The overall results are consistent with a mechanism for higher alcohol synthesis that involves chain growth of a common surface alkyl intermediate, followed by a chain termination step which determines whether the final product desorbs as an alcohol or hydrocarbon.

Of the dispersed semiconductor suspensions, n-SrTiO/sub 3/ has appeared to be the most active photocatalyst with adsorbed energy conversion efficiencies of approx. =6% being reported. Furthermore, both CO/sub 2/ and HCHO have been shown photoreduced to CH/sub 4/ in the presence of illuminated n-SrTiO/sub 3/ suspensions. On dispersed illuminated SiC both CO and CO/sub 2/ have been shown reducible to hydrocarbon products. Reduction of CO/sub 2/ on illuminated SiC particles leads to HCOOH, HCHO, CH/sub 3/OH, and EtOH formation whereas CO reduction has been shown to give CH/sub 4/, C/sub 2/H/sub 4/, C/sub 3/H/sub 6/, and C/sub 3/H/sub 8//sup 6/ as reaction products with no alcohols being observed. In recent years copper has been shown to be the most active electrocatalyst for the electrochemical reduction of CO/sub 2/ or CO in aqueous KHCO/sub 3/. Major reduction products were found to be CH/sub 4/ and C/sub 2/H/sub 4/ with minor products being HCOOH and HCHO. Furthermore, the authors have recently found that formaldehyde can be reduced in aqueous electrolyte to give methane. For in situ electrochemically deposited copper electrodes, cumulative CO/sub 2/ reduction to CH/sub 4/ and C/sub 2/H/sub 4/, at current densities of 8 mA/cm/sup 2/ was found to be nearly faradaic.

The effect of addition of N{sub 2}O, as well as of the complete replacement of oxygen by N{sub 2}O, on the oxidative dehydrogenation of methanol on a silver catalyst has also been studied. It was found that the interaction of silver with N{sub 2}O was much slower than that of O{sub 2}; no atomic surface oxygen species were observed, probably because the formation of subsurface species was not complete; selective adsorption appears to take place on the surface defects and grain boundaries involved in the formation of the subsurface species. Addition of small amounts of N{sub 2}O to the reaction mixture (CH{sub 3}OH + O{sub 2}) for the oxidative dehydrogenation of methanol had almost no influence on the conversion or on the product distribution measured. However, the conversions were considerably lower when oxygen was totally replaced by N{sub 2}O; only above 600 C was the N{sub 2}O exhausted. At the same level of conversion of the methanol, the amount of CO{sub 2} produced was lowered compared to the case of O{sub 2}. This is in agreement with the suggestion that CO{sub 2} is formed via weakly bound surface oxygen.","","","","","","United States","1988-12-01T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: Journal of Catalysis; (USA); Journal Volume: 114:2","","Medium: X; Size: Pages: 303-312","","","","Journal ID: ISSN 0021-9517; CODEN: JCTLA","10.1016/0021-9517(88)90034-6","","2016-04-20T00:00:00Z","7127275","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/7127275","","Journal of Catalysis; (USA)","","114:2"

These complexes may be viewed as two square-planar d/sup 8/ iridium centers held together by two bridging pyrazolyl ligands to form a six-membered Ir-(N-N)/sub 2/-Ir ring. The ring is in a boat conformation with the iridium atoms positioned at the bow and stern such that interaction is possible between the filled d/sub z/sup 2// orbitals from each metal center. The 3,5-dimethylpyrazolyl complex is active as a hydrogenation catalysts while the other related complexes are not. It is found here that there is substantial interaction between the d/sub z/sup 2// atomic orbitals of the two iridium centers, and the ionization corresponding to the Ir-Ir antibonding d/sub z/sup 2//-d/sub z/sup 2// interaction is the lowest energy ionization band of these complexes. This ionization is cleanly separated from the other ionizations of the complexes. Of particular interest is the broad and unusual asymmetry found in the band profile of the initial ionization. The energy of the first ionization band is very sensitive to the methyl substitutions on the pyrazolyl groups. The sensitivity of this ionization to methyl substitution (and in turn the change in reaction chemistry between these complexes) is due more to the electronic inductive effects of the methyl group substitutions than to changes in geometry and splitting of the bonding and antibonding combinations of the metal d/sub z/sup 2// orbitals. 28 refs., 7 figs., 7 tabs.","","","Univ. of Arizona, Tucson (USA)","","","United States","1988-11-30T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: Inorg.

Remaining features are assigned as combinations involving an LM overtone and lower frequency motions of molecules. In contrast to C-H and N-H overtones of molecules with comparable sizes, the O-H overtones are considerably narrower and show both rotational and conformational structures. This implies a more isolated nature of the O-H stretching vibration, which leads to possible slower intramolecular vibrational relaxation than other C-H or N-H oscillators.

The purpose of this work was to determine whether experimental support could be obtained for any of the various mechanisms proposed in the literature for the synthesis of ethanol over methanol catalysts. The methanol was added at six partial pressures so that the ratio of methanol to CO ranged from 1 : 34 to 1 : 250. For each feed ratio the isotopic composition of the reaction products was determined at various contact times from 0.5 to 10 s, and the composition at zero contact time was determined by extrapolation. All four isotopic species possible for ethanol, {sup 12}CH{sub 3}{sup 12}CH{sub 2}OH, {sup 12}CH{sub 3}{sup 13}C{sub 2}OH, {sup 13}CH{sub 3}{sup 12}CH{sub 2}OH, and {sup 13}CH{sub 3}{sup 13}CH{sub 2}OH, were observed; there was no scrambling of the carbon atoms of ethanol. Contrary to what is expected for the formation of ethanol either by condensation or by homologation of methanol, the fraction of carbon-13 in the ethanol at zero contact time was a function of the partial pressure of {sup 13}C methanol in the feed. Also, at low contact times a large fraction of the product ethanol was doubly labeled which is incompatible with the formation of ethanol by carbonylation of formaldehyde, methoxide, or other C{sub 1} species. The isotopic distribution of the ethanolic carbon was consistent with a mechanism that involves a C{sub 1} species that is an intermediate in the formation of both ethanol and methanol.","","","","","","United States","1988-11-01T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: Journal of Catalysis; (USA); Journal Volume: 114:1","","Medium: X; Size: Pages: 90-99","","","","Journal ID: ISSN 0021-9517; CODEN: JCTLA","10.1016/0021-9517(88)90011-5","","2016-05-20T00:00:00Z","6845244","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/6845244","","Journal of Catalysis; (USA)","","114:1"

The mass fraction images were derived from CH/sub 4/ concentrations obtained by simultaneously recording Raman-scattered light with two cameras oriented perpendicular to a thin sheet of laser light passed through the axis of the jet. Using two cameras enhanced the dynamic range by a factor of ten over a single-camera system and allowed concentration measurements down to a mass fraction of 0.003. Axial and radial components of the scalar dissipation were determined and, by assuming isotropy in the radial and azimuthal directions, total dissipation statistics were obtained. The results were used to evaluate modeling assumptions. The radial and axial dissipation components were found to be strongly nonisotropic in the mixing layer at x/d less than or equal to 13, but isotropic further downstream. At all locations along the centerline the dissipation was isotropic. The scalar and dissipation were found to be highly correlated in the mixing layer but uncorrelated on the jet axis. The PDF of dissipation on the axis, off axis, and at the stoichiometric surface were all found to be lognormally distributed. This property was used to collapse all of the PDFs onto one plot. The parameters that define the single plot, lognormal PDF mean, and standard deviation are reported. Instantaneous dissipation levels measured at the expected flame liftoff height were found to be consistent with flame extinction limits extrapolated from laminar opposed jet data. For the single condition measured, this data supports the hypothesis that excessive dissipation can extinguish flames in the developing region of jets.","","","","","","United States","1988-11-01T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: Combust.

The mass spectrometer was calibrated for mass by seeding flames with isotopes of several metals and by using deuterated acetylene, which also allowed us to measure the number of hydrogen atoms in each hydrocarbon ion. The ion concentration sensitivity of the mass spectrometer was calibrated by comparing the individual ion currents with the ion current obtained in operation as a high-pass mass filter (that is, transmitting only those ions whose masses were greater than a specific mass) and by relating these currents to the total ion concentrations determined using a Langmuir probe. Ion-molecule reactions, including those with large ions, were demonstrated to be rapid under these flame conditions. The question of whether the large ions are produced by reactions of small ions with large neutral molecules or by reactions of large ions with small molecules was resolved in favor of the latter reactions. From the sequential changes in the number of carbon and hydrogen atoms and the carbon-to-hydrogen ratio in ions of increasing mass, the authors deduced that the types of ion-molecule reactions occurring included not only acetylene addition to growing ions, but also polyacetylene addition (with or without acetylene elimination) and the addition of allene and propyne. From reaction rate considerations, using literature values for neutral species concentrations in the same flame, the authors concluded that many of the small hydrocarbon molecules observed in this flame, up to and including benzene, could add to large ions to increase the ion mass. This accounts for the extremely rapid growth observed from small ions to very large ions, that is, from 39 amu to about 4500 amu (3 to about 370 carbon atoms) in 1 ms.","","","","","","United States","1988-11-01T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: Combust.

The rate expression is first order in 1-butanol, zero order in O/sub 2/, and negative order in 1-butanol. The photoassisted reaction produces 1-butanal and 1-butene with 89% and 11% selectivity, respectively. The selectivity ratio of the photoassisted reaction is not affected by any of the variations in feed composition or temperature. The dark reaction becomes significant above 473 K and produces larger butene/butanal ratios as well as larger amounts of combustion products. They propose a mechanism for the overall reaction mechanism that is consistent with the observed kinetic and spectroscopic results and develop the rate expression for this mechanism along with a simplified version that applies under the present reaction conditions. Possible mechanistic implications of the selectivity of the alkoxide decomposition elementary step are discussed.","","","Univ. of Minnesota, Minneapolis (USA)","","","United States","1988-10-06T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: J.

This large capacity addition and smaller expansions in other parts of the world will exceed demand growth during 1988 and 1989, easing the squeeze on supplies. As the result of increased supplies, methanol prices could slip slightly in the fourth quarter. They are more likely to decline next year, however. The two plants, which started up in August, are owned and operated by Tenneco Oil Co. Processing and Marketing and by Cape Horn Methanol (CHM). The Tenneco plant, located in Pasadena, Tex., was restarted after a shutdown in 1982 when prices for methanol were low. It now is running at full capacity of 125 million gal per year. The plant uses the low-pressure process technology of Lurgi, reportedly requiring for feedstock and energy between 100,000 and 125,000 cu ft of methane per gallon. Global trade in methanol smooths out the supply and demand inconsistencies. Surging methanol demand in the U.S. and in Western Europe has been met by imports from areas where methanol production is most economical - that is, where natural gas is readily available and has no other application as high in value. Canada, Chile, and Trinidad are examples of those areas.","","","","","","United States","1988-10-03T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: Chem. Eng.

The catalytic properties of this material for methanol oxidation to formaldehyde were investigated in the temperature range 300 to 520 K. At 520 K the initial activity of the amorphous V{sub 2}O{sub 5} was very low. However, during in situ activation at this temperature the activity increased steadily and reached a steady-state value which was about 30 times higher than the initial activity of the amorphous V{sub 2}O{sub 5} and also considerably higher than the activity of crystalline V{sub 2}O{sub 5}. X-ray diffraction indicated that upon exposure to methanol oxidation conditions the amorphous vanadia crystallized slowly and was partly reduced. These changes were accompanied by drastic alterations of the bulk and surface structure of the amorphous precursor as evidence by electron microscopy. The final catalysts exhibiting steady-state activity consisted of crystalline V{sub 2}O{sub 5} and V{sub 3}O{sub 7}. Partial reduction of the bulk was not observed with crystalline vanadia catalysts and appears to be characteristic for the amorphous vanadia. The results indicate that amorphous vanadia undergoes structural changes more easily than its crystalline counterpart and may thus be an interesting catalyst precursor.","","","","","","United States","1988-10-01T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: Journal of Catalysis; (USA); Journal Volume: 112:2","","Medium: X; Size: Pages: 325-333","","","","Journal ID: ISSN 0021-9517; CODEN: JCTLA","10.1016/0021-9517(88)90261-8","","2016-05-10T00:00:00Z","6580128","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/6580128","","Journal of Catalysis; (USA)","","112:2"

Ethylene plants have the process characteristics for which the application of advanced process control (APC) will lead to significant economic benefits. The characteristics include complex reactors, high-purity distillation columns, and rigid composition specifications, plus highly interactive process components and complex levels of utilities. Combined with the high-volume throughput of an ethylene plant, these characteristics create substantial opportunities for APC applications.","","","M.W.

The maximum yield and selectivity obtained for the formation of C{sub 2} hydrocarbons (C{sub 2}H{sub 6} + C{sub 2}H{sub 4}) from CH{sub 4} and O{sub 2} were 22.4% (1073 K) and 57% (1023 K), respectively, over 2 g of 15 mol% Na{sup +}-MgO catalyst. Physical factors of the promoted MgO catalysts were investigated with BET, SEM, and XRD techniques and were compared with the activities. Alkali metal ions, the promoters, caused structural changes in MgO. Those changes, which are related to the activity of C{sub 2} hydrocarbon formation, are classified in two categories: (1) surface activation through the lattice distortion, and (2) specific surface area reduction. When catalysts with the same specific surface areas were compared, alkali ion-doped MgO in which extensive line broadening is observed by XRD was more active than pure MgO. On the other hand, a sintered pure MgO with low specific surface area showed higher C{sub 2} hydrocarbon yield than unsintered pure MgO.

Measurements and predictions are reported of the mean concentrations of major gas species and mean soot volume fractions. Predictions were based on the conserved-scalar formalism in conjunction with the laminar flamelet approximation. The comparison between predictions and measurements was encouraging, suggesting that state relationships for major gas species, found in laminar diffusion flames, were preserved in the overfire region of the turbulent flames. Measurements also indicated nearly constant soot generation efficiencies from point to point in the overfire region for sufficiently long characteristic residence times to yield nearly universal soot volume fraction state relationships at the same conditions. However, effects attributed to finite-rate chemistry were observed at shorter characteristic residence times, causing spatial variations of soot generation efficiencies in the overfire region, with associated loss of universal soot volume fraction state relationships.","","","","","","United States","1988-09-01T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: Combust.

Although the metal carbonyl is not absorbed into the pores of the molecular sieve, it is readily absorbed into the pores and supercages of the Na-Y zeolite. Slow, temperature-programmed heating of the Ru/sub 3/(CO)/sub 12/ in Na-Y to 350/degree/C under a flow of hydrogen results in decarbonylation and formation of a CO hydrogenation catalyst that produces a very atypical (for ruthenium) hydrocarbon distribution truncated at about C/sub 10/. The unusual product distribution presumably arises because the catalyst sites are situated within the zeolite supercages. Thus the metal is highly dispersed and/or the growing hydrocarbon chains are subject to geometrical limitations on their growth. Consistent with this hypothesis, ruthenium carbonyl clusters immobilized on the external surfaces of Na-Y zeolite, Linde 5A molecular sieve, and /gamma/-alumina all exhibit typical, nonselective hydrocarbon product distributions. The same supported ruthenium carbonyl clusters are also extremely active catalysts for the selective hydrogenation of CO/sub 2/(H/sub 2/:CO/sub 2/ = 4:1) to methane. At a lower H/sub 2/:CO/sub 2/ ratio (1:1), however, Na-Y supported Ru/sub 3/(CO)/sub 12/ catalyzes the hydrogenation of CO/sub 2/ to higher hydrocarbons as well (up to C/sub 16/).

Maximum C{sub 2} yields of approximately 15% have been attained and are comparable with those previously observed over Li-doped MgO catalysts. Initial methane activation is believed to be via hydrogen atom abstraction by (Li{sup +}O{sup {minus}}) centers on the catalyst surface, and this results in the formation of surface-generated gas-phase methyl radicals. Gas-phase radical reactions provide the primary pathway for the formation of selective C{sub 2} products. Nonselective C{sub 1} product formation is most likely promoted on the pure ZnO surface. Zinc oxide is a nonbasic semiconductor, whereas MgO is a basic insulator. However, these differences in electronic and basic properties tend to disappear when the oxides are doped with lithium, and the similarities are reflected in the catalytic properties.","","","","","","United States","1988-08-01T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: Journal of Catalysis; (USA); Journal Volume: 112:2","","Medium: X; Size: Pages: 366-374","","","","Journal ID: ISSN 0021-9517; CODEN: JCTLA","","","2009-12-17T00:00:00Z","6555167","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/6555167","","Journal of Catalysis; (USA)","","112:2"

Therefore, the enzymes that catalyze the hydrolysis of cellulose to sugar do not break down the sugars. Thus, enzymatic processes are capable of yields approaching 100%. Enzymatic hydrolysis processes have been under development for only 10 years. Although improvements have been made in enzymatic technology, more are both possible and necessary. The important research issues include understanding the processes necessary to render the crystalline cellulose easily digestible, understanding and improving the basic mechanisms in the hydrolysis step, and developing better and less expensive enzymes. The hemicellulose fraction (25%) is primarily composed of xylan, which is simple to convert to the simple sugar xylose, but the xylose is difficult to ferment to ethanol. There were no practical systems for xylose fermentation 10 years ago. Today, methods have been identified using new yeasts, fungi, bacteria, and processes combining enzymes and yeasts. Although none of the fermentations is yet ready for commercial use, considerable progress has been made. The following sections describe current research efforts in each of the major areas (cellulose hydrolysis, xylose fermentation, and lignin conversion), with an emphasis on enzymatic hydrolysis using fungal enzymes.","","","Solar Energy Research Institute, Golden, CO (US)","","","United States","1988-08-01T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: Chem.

A detailed structural characterization of both the bulk and the surface is also reported. Studies have shown that the optimum reduction temperature, based on thermogravimetric and reactivity studies, is ca. 400/sup 0/C. In addition, the temperature at which the catalysts are initially stabilized with CO/H/sub 2/ was also found to be important, and catalysts stabilized more rapidly at 220/sup 0/C and gave final catalysts with low methane yields and high conversion. The optimum Co/(Co + Mn) ratio for unpromoted catalysts was determined to be in the range 0.15-0.25, and with these catalysts low methane selectivities (3-4% by mass) could be obtained with high C/sub 3/ hydrocarbon selectivities at CO conversions of ca. 40% when operated at 220/sup 0/C. The notable feature of cobalt manganese matrix catalysts is that under most reaction conditions the catalysts give high propene yields together with low methane; in addition, it is demonstrated that the C/sub 3/ hydrocarbon selectivity is linearly dependent on CO conversion.","","","Catalysis Research Programme, Dept. of Chemistry, Univ. of the Witwatersrand, Johannesburg (ZA); Dept. of Inorganic, Physical and Industrial Chemistry, Univ. of Liverpool, Liverpool (GB)","","","United States","1988-08-01T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: Ind.

Both heavy- and light-oil steamflood situations were considered. A one-eighth of a five-spot model representing the two types of reservoirs was used to study the effects of shutting in the injector for up to 8 months on the oil production performance during the shut-in period and following the resumption of steam injection. The simulation results show that temporarily shutting in injectors is not detrimental to overall oil recovery. For each type of reservoir (heavy or light oil), the cumulative oil production at a limiting instantaneous steam/oil ratio (SOR) of 10 was essentially the same regardless of the length of injector shut-in. The cumulative SOR at the end of the project life also remains the same, regardless of the length of injector shut-in. The cumulative SOR at the end of the project life also remains the same, regardless of the length of shut-in. Shutting in the injector, however, prolongs the project life, increasing it by about the length of shut-in for the heavy oil and by more than the length of shut-in for the light-oil case. This paper compares oil production performances for steamflood projects operating under different shut-in scenarios and recommends strategies to cope with the changing economic environment.","","","Chevron Oil Field Research Co.

The turnover frequency (TOF) at 588 K ranges from 10{sup {minus}6} to 10{sup {minus}2} and depends on the Al/Ru ratio and the microcrystal size of Ru. The highest TOFs are obtained over samples leached at 373 K from alloys having an atomic percent of Ru from 6 to 33. These samples have a smaller average Ru crystal size and a lower Al content, ranging from 8 to 18 mol% as measured by X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS). The authors also suggest that the high activity is related to strongly adsorbed nitrogen, the uptake of which exceeds hydrogen adsorption. Almost no XPS chemical shift is observed for any leached Raney Ru, whereas the Ru 3d binding energy in Al-Ru alloys is about 1 eV lower than that in Ru metal powder. In spite of the pronounced chemical shift, the TOF on Al-Ru alloy is quite low. Results suggest that structural factors are mot important in this system, rather than the electronic factor that has been emphasized for supported Ru catalysts.","","","","","","United States","1988-08-01T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: Journal of Catalysis; (USA); Journal Volume: 112:2","","Medium: X; Size: Pages: 469-477","","","","Journal ID: ISSN 0021-9517; CODEN: JCTLA","10.1016/0021-9517(88)90162-5","","2016-05-26T00:00:00Z","6551961","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/6551961","","Journal of Catalysis; (USA)","","112:2"

Also, solvent/oil phase behavior predictions at reservoir pressures - i.e., the accurate construction of the gas/liquid two-phase envelopes in pseudoternary diagrams - closely matched the multicomponent data. The mixing rule proportioning factor was found to be insensitive to pressure.

When ambient air is used as the oxidizer, the results show that the minimum operating temperatures required for stable combustion were 1680 and 1510 K for pure methane and pure ethane, respectively. It was found that the minimum stable operating temperature for methane combustion could be reduced by nearly 80 K by adding ethane as approximately 20% of the total fuel flow.

One site is Ni metal and has the higher activity for CO hydrogenation. The less-reactive CO is on the Al/sub 2/O/sub 3/ support. Only the Ni metal is occupied at 300 K, and transfer for CO between the two sites occurs at higher temperatures. In the presence of adsorbed H/sub 2/, CO that was adsorbed on the Ni metal moved to the Al/sub 2/O/sub 3/ support. This is an activated process, and the only pathway to occupy the Al/sub 2/O/sub 3/ sites is by adsorption on the Ni. The reverse transfer from Al/sub 2/O/sub 3/ to Ni occurs if some of the H/sub 2/ is desorbed; surface hydrogen inhibits this reverse process. These results show that during a typical TPR experiment, transfer between sites competes with reaction.","","","Univ. of Colorado, Boulder (USA)","","","United States","1988-07-28T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: J.

This situation demands a careful evaluation of yield objectives and unit operating constraints. A review of the fundamentals of FCC catalyst design, and how they relate to selection of grades that will achieve optimum performance, can simplify the selection of the optimum FCC catalyst for a particular operation and unit. Specifically, performance parameters such as zeolite type, anticipated equilibrium unit cell size, and the balance between zeolite and matrix cracking selectivity are considered. With a means to rank the selectivities of the various commercial FCC catalysts available, refiners can select catalysts that move the FCC operation nearer to process objectives, while accommodating the mechanical limitations imposed by FCC hardware. The North American refining situation is also reviewed to put the selection process into perspective with current operating practices. These practices include the increased use of octane catalysts, no appreciable increase in resid cracking, and the formulation for more catalysts for specific operations.","","","Davison Chemical Div., W.R.

To deal with the problem of identifying the hydrodynamic parameters of a reactor model, a cellular model was proposed.

The program also will provide an alternative means for possible future production of distillate motor fuels. Most ethylene consumed today is derived from dehydrogenation of ethane or propane. These sources are becoming increasingly tight, and alternatives are being sought by most polyethylene producers. Alternative sources have been on Carbide's research agenda at least since 1969, when the possibilities of converting methane were first examined.

Lean to stoichiometric methane-air flames are considered. The computations are based on both a mechanism of elementary reactions and, alternatively, a mechanism consisting of four global reactions. Comparisons of results as obtained from both mechanisms are presented through the paper. First, attention is focused on an asymmetrical configuration, where one of the counterflowing supply streams carries a cold, reactive mixture of methane and air, and the other the respective mixture of hot equilibrium combustion products. Second, a symmetrical twin-flame configuration is studied that can be produced by directing two identical reactant streams toward each other. Third, the limiting case of low strain rates is considered. Attention is focused on the asymmetrical flow configuration which is particularly relevant for flamelet-models of premixed turbulent combustion. In view of incorporation into such models, computed profiles of the thermochemical variables are plotted versus a reactive-scalar progress variable. For all flow geometries extinction limits are determined and differences in corresponding results are discussed.","","","Cambridge Univ., Univ.

This paper compares the performance of ketones and alcohols that are miscible with base oils at room temperature. The results indicate that the flocculating action of polar solvents in waste oils is, basically, an antisolvent effect exerted on some nonpolar macromolecules. In this context, it has been shown that the difference vertical bardelta/sub 1/ - delta/sub 2/vertical bar between the solubility parameters of the solvent and of a typical polyolefin (polyisobutylene) may be correlated with sludge removal from waste oils and thus be used as a preliminary criterion to select the components of composite solvents. In some cases the polar event induces the formation of an electrically stabilized dispersion. The addition of potassium hydroxide in alcoholic solution easily destabilizes the dispersion and increases sludge removal from waste oils.","","","","","","United States","1988-07-01T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: Ind.

In this paper, the transient Raman studies of the photodynamics of four- and six-coordinate complexes of nickel hydrocorphinoid related to F/sub 430/ are reported. Results of previously reported studies of the transient photoligation behavior of nickel porphyrins are coupled with data from the Raman studies. Photochemical results for the nickel hydrocorphinoids were found to be quite different from that of nickel porphyrin analogues. These results led to a suggestion that nickel hydrocorphinoids may form a functionally distinct class of prosthetic groups with dynamic and electronic characteristics. 28 references, 5 figures, 1 table.","","","Univ. of New Mexico, Albuquerque (USA)","","","United States","1988-06-01T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: Inorg.

This makes it possible to minimize the fraction of fuel used for heat release in any high-temperature partial oxidation, pyrolysis, or other reaction in which the remainder of the fuel is to be processed. Thus, combustion of methane/oxygen/nitrogen mixtures at equivalence ratios of up to 2.34 is shown to yield large proportions of hydrogen and carbon monoxide, as well as appreciable amounts of higher hydrocarbons. In view of the ability of spouted beds to handle solid and heavy liquid fuels, a wide range of potential applications of the method is envisaged, ranging from less polluting combustion systems to processing inexpensive fuels to more desirable products.","","","Imperial College, London (GB)","","","United States","1988-06-01T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: Combust.

The selectivity to higher alcohols can be promoted by alkalinization of the catalyst, but methanol is always the principal reaction product. It is desirable, in order to develop greater selectivity toward higher alcohols, to know the relationship, if any, between methanol formation and higher alcohol formation. In early mechanistic studies it was proposed that over methanol catalysts higher alcohols are formed either by stepwise condensation of methanol or by successive carbonylation of lower alcohols, starting with methanol. Analogous mechanisms were also proposed for other C/sub 1/ intermediates (formaldehyde, surface methoxide. More recently, several schemes based on the addition of various intermediates to a growing alcohol chain have been proposed. None of these mechanistic studies have addressed the question of whether the same sites are active for both methanol and higher alcohol formation. In fact, the nature of the active sites for the synthesis of the higher alcohols has received little attention, and that for the synthesis of methanol, although the subject of numerous studies, remains uncertain. The objective of the work reported here is to establish whether the activity of CuO/ZnO catalysts for the methanol synthesis can be correlated with that for the synthesis of higher alcohols, and, if a relation exists between the two syntheses, to determine its nature. 17 references.","","","Phillips Petroleum Co., Bartlesville, OK (USA)","","","United States","1988-06-01T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: J.

With these precautions, the oxygen-to-carbon selectivity is 10/sup 3/. This is the best oxygen selectivity reported in the literature to date for a microwave-induced plasma detector system.

Evidence has been collected in support the following points: (1) Reaction of basic carbonates of Zn and Mn with a solution of K/sub 2/CrO/sub 4/ at about 70-80/sup 0/C (final pH 8.5) occurs through a redox mechanism; drying at approx. = 100/sup 0/C of the resulting mass provides a catalyst precursor made of a core formed by a phase with a spinel structure and basic zinc carbonate covered by a shell of ..cap alpha..-K/sub 2/CrO/sub 4/ and possibly KHCO/sub 3/. (2) Basic Zn carbonate and KHCO/sub 3/ are decomposed upon activation at 400/sup 0/C. (3) The spinel-like phase is stable under N/sub 2/ upon activation at 400/sup 0/C, whereas it is transformed into a phase with a rock salt-type structure, with related ZnO segregation, upon activation at 400/sup 0/C in H/sub 2/; reoxidation in air induces the reverse transformation. (4) Calcination at 1000/sup 0/C always gives rise to a phase with a tetragonal symmetry typical of Zn/sup II/Mn/sub 2//sup III/O/sub 4/. A lumped kinetic treatment of the catalytic activity data indicates that this catalyst behaves similarly to a commercial ZnCrO catalyst impregnated with K/sub 2/O, but for an overall reduction of activity due to a lower surface area. Characterization of the catalyst after the activity runs provides data very similar to those obtained from the characterization of catalyst samples activated under a reducing atmosphere.","","","Ingegneria Chimica G.

Since the correlation does not require experimental vapor pressures or densities as input data, it is useful for heavy fossil fuels where vapor pressures and densities are difficult or impossible to measure. For fossil-fuel fractions, equation-of-state parameters are found from approximate molecular-structure (characterization) data coupled with a calibration based on pure-component (model-compound) data. Interaction parameters are given for mixtures of fossil fuels with methane, ethane, carbon dioxide, hydrogen, and hydrogen sulfide. While the correlation presented here is useful for calculating vapor-liquid equilibria, it is not intended for conventional fossil fuels, where other correlations are satisfactory. Instead, it is intended for heavy fossil fuels where conventional correlations are often not reliable and where the usual input data are often unavailable.","","","","","","United States","1988-05-01T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: Ind.

All reactions were observed to be fast and can be understood in terms of Si/sup +/ insertion into N-H and C-N bonds to form ions of the type SiNR/sub 1/R/sub 2//sup +/ (r/sub 1/, R/sub 2/ = H, CH/sub 3/) proceeding in competition (in the case of the amines) with hydride ion transfer to form immonium ions of the type CH/sub 2/NR/sub 1/R/sub 2//sup +/ (R/sub 1/, R/sub 2/ = H, CH/sub 3/). C-N bond insertion appears more efficient than N-H bond insertion. The contribution of hydride ion transfer increases with increasing stability of the immonium ion. The latter reaction leads directly to SiH as a neutral product. Other minor reaction channels were seen which lead directly or indirectly to SiCH and SiCH/sub 3/. Rapid secondary proton transfer reactions were observed for SiNH/sub 2//sup +/ and SiNHCH/sub 3//sup +/ to produce gas-phase SiNH and SiNCH/sub 3/ molecules. With methylamine SiNH/sub 2//sup +/ also appears to produce H/sub 2/SiNH/sub 2//sup +/ which may deprotonate to form the simplest silanimine, H/sub 2/SiNH, or aminosilylene, HSiNH/sub 2/.

The thickness of a Cu unit layer was changed in the range 3-10 nm, while that of the oxide support was kept at 10 nm with the total number of accumulated layers being 45. The periodic modulations of as-deposited and heat-treated composites were characterized by means of small-angle X-ray diffraction, Auger electron spectroscopy, secondary ion mass spectrometry, X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy, and scanning electron microscope observations. It was shown that the artificial layer structures were stable upon heat treatment in vacuo and in a H/sub 2/ atmosphere at high temperatures.

A number of these correlations have involved heterogeneous catalysis. Dautzenberg and Knoezinger reported that the 1-alkene selectivity from the dehydration of 2-ols, with the general formula RCH/sub 2/CHOHCH/sub 3/, where R varied from methyl to tert-butyl, fit a LFER when correlated with Taft's inductive constant. Davis found that isomerization of the primary alkene products from 2-butanol and 2-pentanol could make a significant contribution in determining the slope of the LFER plot for an alumina catalyst. Davis contended that the inductive effect had little, if any, impact in determining the selectivity for terminal alkene. In view of the results with the alumina catalysts, it appeared desirable to extend the alcohol dehydration study to include other catalysts. Davis found that 2-octanol, because of its higher boiling point, provided a higher relative pressure and, as a consequence, a higher surface coverage than 2-butanol; thus, at low (less than ca. 20%) conversion 2-octanol effectively retarded secondary reactions of the primary butene and pentene products. Consequently, 2-butanol and 2-pentanol were converted in the presence of 2-octanol in these studies. Data are given for the following catalysts: aluminum oxide, thorium oxide, tungsten oxide, gallium oxide, indium oxide, and titanium oxide. 14 references.","","","Kentucky Energy Cabinet Lab., Lexington (USA)","","","United States","1988-04-01T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: J.

The calculations have predicted that a bent rhodium carbonyl hydride species is much more stable than a rhodium formyl species. They have also predicted that the Rh-H stretching frequency should be more than 300 cm/sup -1/ lower than the C-O stretching frequency for the rhodium carbonyl hydride species. This prediction is at odds with assigned Rh-H stretching frequencies for Rh organometallic complexes which place Rh-H and C-O stretching frequencies in the same region of the spectrum (2000-2200 cm/sup -1/). The experimental data are not conclusive on this point. The calculations do satisfactorily rationalize the enhanced dissociation of the C-O bond for the rhodium carbonyl hydride species caused by the presence of the hydride moiety.","","","Auburn Univ., AL (USA)","","","United States","1988-03-10T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: J.

Quantum chemical studies on this may be useful in elucidating CO-transition metal interactions. We considered carbonyl structures M-C=O and isocarbonyl ones M-O=C, (M = Co, Co/sup +/, Co/sup 2+/) in states with various spin multiplicities. Our self-consistent procedure in the unrestricted Hartree-Fock method means that the central atom electron configuration cannot be specified ab initio, and only the overall spin in specified explicitly, i.e, the numbers of /alpha/ and /beta/ electrons in the molecule. At the end of the iteration, one can determine what electron configuration in the central atom is associated with a given state. The results show that carbon monoxide coordinates to cobalt atoms and to singly and doubly charged cobalt ions to give isocarbonyls as well as carbonyls. It is found that the reactivity of CO increases when a coordination bond is formed on the oxygen atom. An increase in charge on the metal atom also raises the stability in the carbonyl and isocarbonyl complexes.","","","Zhdanov Irkutsk Univ.

No reference to measurements of catalytic reaction rates is used in the determination of the input parameters. The model predicts reaction rates in agreement with experiments using the industrial catalyst over large intervals of reaction conditions. This strongly suggests that the model reproduces the essential features of the kinetics of ammonia synthesis. From the model it is found that the largest contribution to the activation enthalpy for the catalytic synthesis of NH/sub 3/ at high pressures is the energetic cost of creating two free sites on the surface of the working catalyst. The calculated activation enthalpy under typical high-pressure reaction conditions is almost but not completely constant. The predicted values are in good agreement with experiment. It is shown that the reaction orders for N/sub 2/, H/sub 2/, and NH/sub 3/ are directly related to the surface coverages by reaction intermediates. The calculated reaction orders at high pressures are in good agreement with those observed in many previous investigations. The coverages by adsorbed NH, NH/sub 2/, NH/sub 3/, and H species are found to be larger than the coverage by free sites, i.e., the fraction of unoccupied sites. The authors suggest that this is the reason why the kinetics of ammonia synthesis cannot be well described by a Langmuir-Hinshelwood expression with only one surface intermediate. It is further shown that the observed high-pressure kinetics may be explained without the assumption of surface heterogeneity used in the usual derivation of the Temkin-Pyzhev or Ozaki-Taylor-Boudart kinetics. 65 references.","","","Haldor Topsoe Research Labs., Lyngby (Denmark)","","","United States","1988-03-01T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: J.

The assessment of catalytic selectivity is of major importance to refiners because it determines the preferred selective formation of desired products, with the suppression of unwanted by-products. Recent developments in FCC catalysts have resulted in a wide range of product types designed to address specific customer requirements such as coke selectivity and octane enhancement. This means that a careful evaluation of the various types of catalysts has become increasingly important. Using MAT equipment, it is possible to generate detailed information on catalytic selectivity. Measurement of full yield curves using hte variation of reactor severity (catalyst/oil ratio) procedure requires only small quantities of catalyst and feed, and is relatively quick and simple to perform. The application of the MAT test to catalyst selectivity is detailed in this article.","","","Grace GmbH, Worms (DE)","","","United States","1988-02-08T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: Oil Gas J.; (United States); Journal Volume: 86:6","","Medium: X; Size: Pages: 35-37","","","","Journal ID: CODEN: OIGJA","","","2009-12-16T00:00:00Z","5431993","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/5431993","","Oil Gas J.; (United States)","","86:6"

It is shown that there is a dependence of the formation of formaldehyde and methyl formate, the principal products, on the molybdenum content for grated catalysts with a higher selectivity for methyl formate. In contrast, the dependence is not clear for the impregnated catalysts, and this appears to be due to the lack of reproducibility in their preparation, and to their Mo dispersion being lower than that of the grated Mo/SiO/sub 2/ catalysts. The study of the formation of methyl formate using different reactive mixtures and kinetic calculations led the authors to propose a mechanism which involves the formation of formaldehyde from methanol on Mo sites, followed by its migration on silica, where it further reacts with methoxy groups to form methyl formate via a hemiacetal intermediate.","","","Universite P. et M.

The complete statistical description of the thermochemistry is obtained from a one point probability density function (pdf) and detailed chemical kinetic laminar flame structure. The pdf is approximated by a beta function for a dimensionless reaction progress variable based on temperature rise. The laminar flame structures for lean CH/sub 4/-air and C/sub 3/H/sub 8/-air mixtures have been obtained from the researches of Dixon-Lewis and Westbrook, respectively. Mean heat release rate and the covariance of heat release rate and temperature are derived from the computed pdf and heat release rate for the laminar flame. Measured temperatures and species concentrations are compared with model predictions. Particular emphasis is placed on the concentrations of intermediate species, such as CO, C/sub 2/H/sub 4/ and C/sub 2/H/sub 6/, as a test of the model. Agreement between the model and experiment is good except in regions of high turbulent straining. The research suggests that the model shows promise for further developments. In the engineering context future work should focus on both the oxidation kinetics of higher hydrocarbons in laminar flames and the effects of flame straining.","","","Dept. of Mechanical Engineering, Univ. of Leeds, Leeds (GB)","","","United States","1988-02-01T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: Combust.

Also studied were the mixing of the two flows without combustion (..cap alpha.. = 0) and a configuration where the combustion was stabilized by a recirculation zone in a downward facing step. In part I, previous experimental results (visualizations, LDV, averaged concentrations) are recalled. Through some characteristic data (turbulence intensity, and profiles of velocity and CH/sub 4/ and CO concentrations), the structure of the flame and its scales and the increase of turbulence within the flame zone are discussed and compared to other works in turbulent combustion. In Part II, instantaneous measurements of fluctuating temperatures are presented. These measurements have been performed using broadband CARS on N/sub 2/. The CARS system, the choice of the optical arrangement (BOXCARS, parallel polarizations of laser beams), and the data reduction are described. Temperature pdfs were obtained at various locations in the stabilization region of the flame. The comparison between pdfs with and without combustion, the bimodal shape of the pdf in the mean flame zone, and the position of the hot and cold peaks as a function of the location within the flow show that the characteristic chemical time is not infinitely small. This observation confirms that the flame is not purely wrinkled. In the case of the recirculation zone, this zone cannot be considered as a well stirred reactor; the fluctuations of the temperature are bimodal in the mixing layer between the recirculation zone and the external flow.","","","Office National d'Etudes et de Recherches Aerospatiales, Chatillon (FR)","","","United States","1988-02-01T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: Combust.

"Photodynamics of nickel porphyrins in noncoordinating solvents: characterization of d-d excited states using transient raman spectroscopy","Findsen, E W; Shelnutt, J A; Ondrias, M R","37 INORGANIC, ORGANIC, PHYSICAL AND ANALYTICAL CHEMISTRY; 10 SYNTHETIC FUELS; NICKEL COMPOUNDS; EXCITED STATES; PHOTOCHEMISTRY; PORPHYRINS; EXPERIMENTAL DATA; LIFETIME; NEODYMIUM LASERS; PHOTOCHEMICAL REACTIONS; RAMAN SPECTROSCOPY; CARBOXYLIC ACIDS; CHEMICAL REACTIONS; CHEMISTRY; DATA; ENERGY LEVELS; HETEROCYCLIC ACIDS; HETEROCYCLIC COMPOUNDS; INFORMATION; LASER SPECTROSCOPY; LASERS; NUMERICAL DATA; ORGANIC ACIDS; ORGANIC COMPOUNDS; ORGANIC NITROGEN COMPOUNDS; SOLID STATE LASERS; SPECTROSCOPY; TRANSITION ELEMENT COMPOUNDS; 400500* - Photochemistry; 090120 - Hydrocarbon Fuels- Preparation- (1976-1989)","The photodynamic behavior of several nickel porphyrins in noncoordinating solvents was investigated with absorption and transient Raman spectroscopies. A recent transient absorption study of nickel porphyrins, in noncoordinating solvents proposed that, upon photoexcitation from the ground 4-coordinate state (/sup 1/A/sub 1g/), the excited-state decay path traverses a state in which the metal is in an electronic state (designated here as *B/sub 1g/) similar to that observed for the metal in coordinating solvent systems (/sup 3/B/sub 1g/). This excited state involves the net promotion of one of the two nickel electrons in the d/sub z2/ orbital into the empty d/sub x2-y2/ orbital. While the lifetime of the *B/sub 1g/ state has been estimated to be approx. 250 ps, it can be observed by using approx. 10-ns-wide laser pulses under appropriate experimental conditions. Simple calculations demonstrate the effect of state lifetimes upon the population of the excited-sate species within the nanosecond laser pulse. The *B/sub 1g/ state is reversibly formed for several nickel porphyrins in all noncoordinating solvents used. This state is identified in transient Raman spectra by shifts in several lines. Three of these lines are sensitive to changes in the core size of the porphyrin and indicate expansion of the porphyrin core to accommodate the increased in-plane electron density caused by the electron promotion on the metal. Detailed examination of one nickel porphyrin, NiPPDME, indicates a dependence of the *B/sub 1g/ state's vibrational characteristics upon the solvent environment and implies that the porphyrin a/sub 2u/ orbital is very sensitive to solvent environment. Absorption studies indicate that while both the a/sub 1u/ and a/sub 2u/ orbitals can be influenced by the solvent environment, the a/sub 2u/ orbital is the most affected.","","","Univ., of New Mexico, Albuquerque","","","United States","1988-01-28T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: J.

These results are accounted for in terms of the concentration-based solute partition coefficients KAPPA/sub R/. Thus, taking water-methanol mobile phases as an example, the injection of a small amount of either compound is to alter its partition coefficient due, if nothing else, to the resultant change of the composition of the bulk mobile phase. Further, the respective partition coefficients of the mobile-phase components (hence their retentions) will in all likelihood not be identical. Moreover, for liquid-liquid and reverse-phase LC systems at least, while the magnitude of the change of each of the component KAPPA/sub R/ is difficult to forecast, the direction is to be predicated on the finite concentration activity coefficients of the solutes in the blended solvent. For example, because water gives substantially larger negative deviations from Raoult's law with methanol-rich solvents than does methanol, the former is expected to be retained relative to the latter when such blends are employed as LC mobile phases; the converse should then obtain for water-rich carriers. Both situations have been verified experimentally.","","","Dept. of Chemistry, Brigham Young Univ., Provo, UT (US)","","","United States","1988-01-01T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: J.

Under these conditions, no more than 0.15 monolayers (ML) of potassium can be stabilized on the iron surfaces. The Fe(110) surface shows no activity for ammonia synthesis in this study with or without adsorbed potassium. The presence of potassium on the Fe(111) and Fe(100) surfaces increases the rate of ammonia synthesis markedly. At a low reaction conversion of 0.3% the rate over Fe(111) and Fe(100) is enhanced by a factor of two in the presence of potassium. The effect of potassium on Fe(111) and Fe(100) is enhanced as higher reaction conversions (i.e., increasing ammonia partial pressures) are achieved because potassium induces changes in the reaction orders for both ammonia and hydrogen. No change in the activation energy for the reaction is observed with potassium, suggesting that the reaction mechanism has not been altered. Temperature-programmed desorption shows that the adsorption energy of ammonia is significantly reduced when coadsorbed with potassium. A model is proposed in which the decrease of ammonia adsorption energy, induced by potassium, reduces the concentration of ammonia on the iron surface. This effect decreases the number of active sites blocked by the ammonia product, thereby increasing the rate of ammonia synthesis. The model also suggests that an additional effect of potassium is to increase the rate of nitrogen dissociative chemisorption by about 30% over Fe(111) and Fe(100) under ammonia synthesis conditions. 26 references.","","","Lawrence Berkeley National Lab.

The temperature was varied from 582 to 763 K, the total pressure from 3 to 21 bar, and the hydrogen partial pressure from 2 to 20 bar. The bifunctional reforming reactions were best described by Hougen-Watson rate equations corresponding to a single-site surface reaction on the acid function as the rate-determining step. Electrobalance experiments showed that the isomerization rate, the dehydrogenation rate, and the coking rate exponentially decrease with coke content. The coking rate equations were derived from the regression of the ascending coke content profiles obtained in the tubular reactor after experiments under deactivating conditions. Coke deposition mainly originates from highly unsaturated C/sub 7/ naphthenes, such as cyclopentadienes and methylcyclohexadienes.","","","Laboratorium voor Petrochemische Techniek, Rijksuniversiteit Gent, B-9000 Gent (BE)","","","United States","1988-01-01T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: Ind.

The authors have employed semiempirical quantum-mechanical calculations (INDO) to study the electronic properties of ZnO, CuO, and CuO/sub 2/ clusters (less than or equal to 26 atoms), of Cu absorbed on or substituted in these ZnO clusters, and of CO chemisorbed on ZnO(0001) and Cu/ZnO clusters. The results are discussed in light of models previously proposed to explain the unique properties of Cu/ZnO catalysts, which often involve Cu/sup +/ impurities in (on) the ZnO lattice. They use mainly the calculated charge on the Cu atom and its interaction with CO to address the electronic properties of Cu substituted in and adsorbed on ZnO clusters. Their results for neutral clusters indicate that, with respect to atomic charge, this Cu is quite similar in nature to the Cu atoms of bulk CuO or the Zn atoms of ZnO, where the metal has a formal oxidation state of +2. The Cu site in these ZnO clusters shows unique electron affinity properties, accepting a major fraction of the added electron density for anionic clusters. The mechanisms of CO chemisorptive bond formation on Cu(100), ZnO(0001), and Cu-doped ZnO are compared and contrasted based on the present results and those in the literature.","","","Indiana Univ., Bloomington (USA)","","","United States","1987-12-31T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: J.

The structure and function of molybdenum in the MoFe protein of this system has been the subject of a number of investigations, including the use of X-ray absorption spectroscopy. This paper reports the results of the authors recent studies on several states of the MoFe protein and its FeMo cofactor (which is extruded by treatment with N-methylformamide). Mo K-edge (XANES) and extended fine structure (EXAFS) spectra have been recorded to high energies above the absorption edge with excellent signal-to-nose on the semireduced form of the MoFe protein from both Clostridium pasteurianum and Azotobacter vinelandii and on the as isolated FeMo-co and FeMo-co treated with benzenethiol and with benzeneselenol. In all of the states studied, EXAFS results reveal that the Mo is in an environment that contains two or three oxygen (or nitrogen) atoms at 2.10-2.12 A, three to five S atoms at 2.37 A, and three to four Fe atoms at 2.68-2.70 A.

Propionaldehyde is the principal product formed when NaOH is used as the base. The rate of reaction is found to increase with ethylene concentration and is second order with respect to Fe(CO)/sub 5/. The reaction is inhibited by CO. The increase in reaction rate with temperature corresponds to an activation energy of 31 kcal/mol. Infrared spectra indicate that HFe(CO)/sub 4/-and Fe(CO)/sub 5/ are present in the solution phase under reaction conditions. The experimental results are shown to be consistent with a mechanism in which the rate-determining step involves a binuclear iron carbonyl derivative. The substitution of (C/sub 2/H/sub 5/)/sub 3/N for NaOH facilitates the reduction of propionaldehyde to form 1-propanol but results in a slower rate for the overall reaction.","","","Univ. of Georgia, Athens","","","United States","1987-11-25T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: J.

The Pd surface area was measured before and after kinetic runs at 0.1 MPa (1 atm) and 1.5 MPa with these Pd/REO catalysts. Methanation activation energies were 30.4 +/- 1.1 kcal/mole. The turnover frequency (TOF) at 548 K for methane ranged from 1.2 x 10/sup -3/ to 4.8 x 10/sup -3/ s/sup -1/, which is up to 40 times that on Pd powder. The average activation energy for methanol synthesis was 19.6 +/- 0.8 kcal/mole, and TOFs varied from 1.6 x 10/sup -3/ to 6.1 x 10/sup -3/ s/sup -1/. When these results are combined, the patterns for methanation at 0.1 MPa and CH/sub 3/OH synthesis at 1.5 MPa are established as a function of the position of the REO in the periodic table. There is a clear influence of the support on catalytic properties. No trend occurs between methanation activity and the acidity of the support, but a correlation exists between the CH/sub 4/ TOF and the activation energy for electrical conductivity. The TOF for CH/sub 3/OH synthesis shows a strong correlation with the basicity of the REO, which varies with the lanthanide contraction. This behavior also indicated that the support participates directly in the reaction sequence, and this trend strongly supports a mechanism involving formate species on the REO surface, which are formed most readily on the most basic oxides, such as La/sub 2/O/sub 3/. The possibility of a heterogeneous analog of the Cannizzaro reaction is pointed out, and this route may also influence methanol formation.","","","Pennsylvania State Univ., University Park (USA)","","","United States","1987-11-01T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: J.

The behavior of the liquid volume fraction along these isochores is found to be similar to that for pure fluids. Rectilinear diameters for varying overall densities (fixed composition) are seen to be nearly coincident. Straight-line diameters and the critical liquid volume fraction method are utilized to predict critical densities using data near and removed from the critical point. Both methods give acceptable results but the critical liquid volume fraction method is more accurate. A critical literature review of the need for binary mixture critical densities is presented and a proposed experimental procedure is given for the determination of mixture critical densities.","","","Calvin College, Grand Rapids, MI","","","United States","1987-11-01T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: Int.

After acetic acid monomer adsorbs molecularly at 170 K, the acid hydrogen is irreversibly lost at 240 K and a bridge-bonded acetate is formed. The bridge-bonded acetate then undergoes a reversible transformation to a monodentate acetate above 320 K which eventually decomposes to CO/sub 2/, C(ad), and H/sub 2/ at 435 K. Acetic acid dimer adsorbs molecularly at 170 K with the hydrogen-bonded ring approximately parallel to the surface. The dimer decomposes by dehydration at 255 K to adsorbed CO, a bridge-bonded acetate, and an adsorbed methyl group. The acetate decomposes to CO/sub 2/, C(ad), and H/sub 2/ at 440 K. The key step in the acetate decompositions is the C-C bond scission.

The ethanol-water azeotrope is destroyed if the content of mono- or triethylene glycol is 25 mass % or more. With water contents from 0 to 60 mole % in ethanol the presence of separating agents increases the distribution ratio of water between the liquid and the vapor, while with water contents from 70 to 100 mole % the distribution ratio is lowered.","","","","","","United States","1987-10-20T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: J.

The second cation (Cr/sup 3 +/, Al/sup 3 +/) is primarily a stabilizer of a defect spinel oxide phase. Since hydrogen reservoir capacity plays an important role in the hydrogenation of dienes, the variation of the occluded hydrogen concentration was studied as a function of the calcination temperature of the oxide precursor as well as a function of the second cation.

In the second system, illumination of an aqueous solution under CO/sub 2/ that includes Ru(II) tris(bipyrazine) as sensitizer, TEOA as electron donor, and the Ru colloids leads to the formation of methane, ethylene, and ethane, and no H/sub 2/-evolution occurs. The reduction process of CO/sub 2/ proceeds via electron transfer of metal-activated CO/sub 2/ rather than through a hydrogenation route. Detailed studies show that the H/sub 2/-evolution process can be inhibited by the addition of bipyrazine, while CO/sub 2/ reduction is inhibited in the presence of added thiols. Methanation of CO/sub 2/ by hydrogen proceeds in the dark in the presence of Pt and Ru or Os colloids and in the presence of MQ/sup 2 +/ (1).

For temperatures above 750 K, the reaction rate approaches first order in ammonia pressure, and the apparent activation energy is 5.0 +/- 0.3 kcal x mol/sup -1/. A kinetic isotope effect is observed at these high temperatures, and the activation energy for the decomposition of deuteriated ammonia is 6.6 +/- 0.3 kcal x mol/sup -1/. This apparent activation energy is associated with the difference in activation energies between that of the cleavage of a nitrogen-hydrogen (nitrogen-deuterium) bond in chemisorbed ammonia and that of the desorption of molecularly chemisorbed ammonia. At lower temperatures, the reaction rate is independent of ammonia pressure, and the apparent activation energy is 43 +/- 3 kcal x mol/sup -1/, which is associated with the recombinative desorption of nitrogen. From transient thermal desorption mass spectrometric measurements, the activation energy of the recombinative desorption of nitrogen on Ru(001) is 44.0 +/- 0.5 kcal x mol/sup -1/, and the preexponential factor of the desorption rate coefficient is (1.3 +/- 0.6) x 10/sup -3/ cm/sup 2/ x s/sup -1/. On the basis of thermal desorption measurements during the steady-state decomposition of ammonia at 2 x 10/sup -6/ Torr, nitrogen adatoms are shown to be the dominant surface species under these experimental conditions.

Certain heteropoly acids, like H/sub 3/PW/sup 12/O/sub 40/ and H/sub 3/PMo/sub 12/O/sub 40/, easily absorb a large amount of water, alchols, and ethers in the solid state, although their surface areas are very low. This is not adsorption in micropores; rather molecules are absorbed between the lattice polyanions, sometimes expanding the lattice. The expansion can be seen visually as well as by x-ray diffraction. The authors showed that in some cases catalytic reactions take place in this novel bulk phase. Presumably due to this behavior, very high catalytic activity and unique selectivity as well as unusual reactivity order have been observed. They called this state the pseudoliquid phase. However, in only one case was the amount of absorbed reactant measured under the working conditions. They report here unusual pressure dependencies of the rate and selectivity of ethanol dehydration over heteropoly compounds. The dependency can only be explained by the formation of a pseudoliquid phase, i.e., a phase where the amount of absorbed ethanol has changed as a function of ethanol pressure.","","","Univ. of Tokyo, Japan","","","United States","1987-09-02T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: J.

On ionic oxides at about 250 K dioxymethylene is always observed, generally together with variable amounts of the linear polymer that has been isolated on magnesia at 170 K. Heating up to or above room temperature results in the disproportionation of dioxymethylene into formate and methoxide groups, probably via a Cannizzaro-type mechanism.

The equivalence ratios of the flames were 0.89 (1), 0.36 (2), and 0.21 (3). Flame 3 seemed to be the flame with the highest experimental accuracy. A time-dependent flame code with an implicit description for both chemistry and transport allowed extensive computations. Two kinetic mechanisms for methanol combustion were used to compute the species profiles. The first was based on the mechanism compiled by Westbrook, Dryer, and Schugh (WDS), but with 5 times the rate constant for the reaction HCO + M. The second mechanism was compiled by Dove and Warnatz (DW). Strikingly, the experimental CH/sub 2/OH maxima were much smaller than the corresponding computational maxima. The smallest differences were found in flame 3. In this flame the experimental CH/sub 2/OH maxima were about 70 and 20 times smaller than computational maxima found by using the WDS and DW mechanisms, respectively. The sensitivity analysis gave analogous results for the three flames. It was found that the CH/sub 2/OH profiles in the three flames were dominated by the reaction CH/sub 2/OH + O/sub 2/. An increase in the rate constant of reaction CH/sub 2/OH + O/sub 2/ decreased the CH/sub 2/OH maxima nearly linearly, leaving other species profiles almost unchanged. For this reaction a rate constant (WDS) of about 1.0 x 10/sup 14/ exp(-3019/T) cm/sup 3/ mol/sup 1/ s/sup -1/ gave good agreement between the experimental and computational maxima for CH/sub 2/OH in flame 3.","","","Chalmers Univ. of Technology, Gothenburg, Sweden","","","United States","1987-07-16T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: J.

The coke oven gas is processed into an acceptable fuel. The final step in the processing of this gas is the stripping of ammonia from methylethylamine by steam distillation at about 270/sup 0/F. The original ammonia stripping column was fabricated in 1978 with the shell, bottom and internals of Type 316L stainless steel. The top portion was made of a high nickel (Ni) wrought alloy containing about 15.5% chromium (Cr), 16% molybdenum (Mo), 4% tungsten, 5.5 % iron and less than 0.01% carbon. The alloy offers outstanding resistance to localized corrosion by both oxidizing and reducing media including ferric and cupric chlorides, formic and acetic acids, acetic anhydride and brine solutions. It is also resistant to pitting and stress corrosion cracking by sulfur compounds and chloride ions, and to oxidizing atmospheres up to 1900/sup 0/F. Severe corrosion of the stainless steel components caused the stripper to fail after only 16 days of operation. The high nickel top of the column, however, was in excellent condition without any evidence of chemical attack. The new column was constructed entirely of the Ni-Cr-Mo alloy, based on the superior corrosion resistance exhibited in the original column. The shell of the 20'' diameter, 54' tall column was made from 1/4'' thick sheet. The ammonia stripping column of high nickel alloy has been operating since October 1984 and periodic inspection reveals no signs of pitting or other damage by the hot aggressive media. Consequently, the plant projects a long service life without any maintenance requirements.","","","Armco, Inc., Middletown, OH","","","United States","1987-07-01T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: Chem.

Significant conversions of CO to CO2 in the TPD of CO and of CO2 to CO in the TPD of CO2 were observed. The interconversion of CO and CO2 was significantly affected by pretreatment with O2 or H2 at elevated temperatures. Hydrogen treatment at 773 K completely suppressed CO2 formation from CO but enhanced the formation of CO from CO2. Oxidation of the sample increased the conversion of CO to CO2 to almost 80% but suppressed the conversion of CO2 to CO. A number of mechanisms are considered to explain the interconversion. The reversible reaction of CO adsorbed on Pt with a lattice oxygen (or, conversely, CO2, with an oxygen vacancy) in the environs of the Pt crystals is proposed. The abundance of lattice oxygen and lattice oxygen vacancies at the Pt/CeO2 interface determines the CO/CO2 TPD profiles. The mechanism is consistent with two experiments in which isotopes were employed, a C YO TPD experiment and an experiment in which the surface was oxidized with YO2.","","","Univ. of Texas, Austin","","","United States","1987-06-04T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: J.

From the values of the equilibrium potentials of these steps it follows that in the absence of an overvoltage each of them would possess an appreciable rate in acid and neutral solutions. However, the overvoltage of the reduction of CO/sub 2/ and H/sub 2/CO exceeds 1 V, while for H/sub 2/CO/sub 2/ and CH/sub 3/OH it is even greater. The cause of the overvoltage is the formation of intermediate energy-rich particles, but the equilibrium potentials of the one-electron reactions producing these radicals do not explain the great difficulties in the reduction of H/sub 2/CO/sub 2/ and CH/sub 3/OH. It was suggested that in the reduction of simple organic radicals R, carbanions R/sup -/ are formed, followed by their conversion to stable RH molecules. This hypothesis agrees with data on the significantly higher activation energy of the reactions of electron-proton transfer with the formation of a CH bond in comparison with the formation of an O-H bond.

Experimental results were analyzed by using the mixture fraction (conserved scalar) as the independent variable. Results show that for a diffusion flame burning heptane the approximation that the Lewis numbers for all species are approximately equal to unity is valid.

"Role of O/sup -/ surface radicals for methane CH bond activation and subsequent reactions on MoO/sub 3/: molecular orbital theory","Mehandru, S P; Anderson, A B; Brazdil, J F; Grasselli, R K","37 INORGANIC, ORGANIC, PHYSICAL AND ANALYTICAL CHEMISTRY; 10 SYNTHETIC FUELS; METHANE; OXIDATION; MOLYBDENUM OXIDES; CATALYTIC EFFECTS; ELECTRONIC STRUCTURE; FORMALDEHYDE; METHANOL; MOLECULAR MODELS; MOLECULAR ORBITAL METHOD; MOLECULAR STRUCTURE; THEORETICAL DATA; ALCOHOLS; ALDEHYDES; ALKANES; CHALCOGENIDES; CHEMICAL REACTIONS; DATA; HYDROCARBONS; HYDROXY COMPOUNDS; INFORMATION; MATHEMATICAL MODELS; MOLYBDENUM COMPOUNDS; NUMERICAL DATA; ORGANIC COMPOUNDS; OXIDES; OXYGEN COMPOUNDS; REFRACTORY METAL COMPOUNDS; TRANSITION ELEMENT COMPOUNDS; 400201* - Chemical & Physicochemical Properties; 090221 - Alcohol Fuels- Chemical Synthesis- (1976-1989)","A molecular orbital study is made of the reaction of methane with O/sup -/ hole centers on the surface of MoO/sub 3/. The following predictions are made. When the O/sup -/ is created by a UV O 2p ..cap alpha.. Mo 4d charge-transfer excitation, heterolytic products, OH/sup -/ and Mo/sub V/ x CH/sub 3/, form readily at the edges of the crystals where unsaturated molybdenum sites are present. Deexcitation to OH/sup -/ and Mo/sup VI/:CH/sub 3//sup -/ is expected to proceed rapidly and a side reaction to slightly less stale homolytic products, OH/sup -/, 2Mo/sup V/, and OCH/sub 3//sup -/, may also take place, preventing deexcitation so that Mo/sup V/ is not oxidized to Mo/sup VI/, so that the excitation energy may be said to be chemically stored. The CH bond activation barrier is calculated to be 0.7 eV. Activation is a consequence of a stabilizing 3-centered CH-O/sup -/ sigma-donation interaction, the antibonding counterpart of which takes the hole and is occupied by only one electron in the transition state. If a second electron-hole pair is formed, the methyl radical can shift to the O/sup -/ center with a slight loss in stability, and the surface is reduced by two electrons. The methyl cation which is formed can be viewed as a methyl radical which has promoted an electron to a nearby Mo/sup VI/. Once the methyl radical moves to a basal plane of the crystal, which is covered entirely by oxygen anions, it diffuses with a low approx.0.4-eV barrier.","","","Case Western Reserve Univ., Cleveland, OH","","","United States","1987-05-21T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: J.

A new experimental technique for measuring fluid densities is presented, which is based on the well-known Taylor dispersion experiment for measuring mutual diffusion coefficients. The equipment and working equation are both simple, yet experimental results show that the method is accurate to at least 0.1%. An analysis of errors indicates that the accuracy could be improved to 0.01%. This new technique is of particular virtue since it can be used to obtain simultaneous measurements of the fluid density and diffusion coefficient of a solute in the fluid, using data from a single experiment.","","","Texas A and M Univ., College Station","","","United States","1987-05-01T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: Int.

The investigation covered the gases H/sub 2/, He, Ne, CH/sub 4/, N/sub 2/, air, Ar, and Kr. For gases whose conductivity is better than that of air (H/sub 2/, He) the measured values are too small, and for gases of poorer conductivity they are too high. Corrections for the effect of impurity have been applied to the measurements presented. These impurity corrections are considerably larger than the precision of the measurements, but they are of the order of the estimated overall uncertainty of the measurements.

Experiments were conducted on samples prepared by depositing copper on the (001) plane, i.e., the basal plane, of a ruthenium single crystal and on the surface of a ruthenium powder as well. When the amount of copper present on the surface was approximately one-third to one-half of a monolayer, the xenon photoemission spectrum obtained with the ruthenium powder differed significantly from that obtained with a well annealed, smooth (001) surface plane. The copper appears to form islands on the smooth (001) plane but on the surface of the ruthenium powder it is not present in this form. Consequently, copper deposited on a smooth (001) plane of ruthenium would not seem to be a good model of a ruthenium-copper catalyst. Introduction of defects into the (001) plane prior to copper deposition yields a surface which corresponds more closely to that of typical catalysts. These findings provide a reasonable way of rationalizing differences observed when studies of the effect of copper on the ethane of copper on the ethane hydrogenolysis activity of a ruthenium single crystal are compared with studies of the influence of copper on hydrogenolysis activity in actual ruthenium-copper catalysts.","","","Exxon Research and Engineering Co., Annandale, NJ","","","United States","1987-04-23T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: J.

Its general chemistry and applications have been described elsewhere. Presently, there are two gas chromatographic methods reported for the determination of hydroxylamine in aqueous media. The first involves reacting the hydroxylamine to form acetone oxime and subsequently injecting the aqueous solution directly into a gas chromatograph equipped with nitrogen and flame ionization detectors. The second involves oxidizing hydroxylamine to nitrous oxide and trapping the gas for determination in an electron capture equipped gas chromatograph. Limits of detection are in the micromolar range for the former and the nanomolar range for the latter. Here, an alternate gas chromatographic procedure for determining hydroxylamine as the acetone oxime is described. Neither direct aqueous injection nor elaborate instrumentation is required. Extraction of the oxime into an ether phase allows for concentrating the analyte ad facilitates the use of an internal standard. The limitations and inconveniences of direct aqueous injection are avoided included column degradation and filament burnout in mass spectrometry detectors.","","","Univ. of Wisconsin, Madison","","","United States","1987-04-15T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: Anal.

The aim of the work was to model spectral shifts caused by hydrogen bonding and excited-state intermolecular interactions. If the excitation is located primarily on the proton acceptor then the complex is dissociative in the excited state; in the alternative case the complex becomes more tightly bound. Complexes between excited planar ammonia as proton donor and a water molecule as acceptor represent the global minimum on the excited-state surface. An alternate relaxed excited-state structure conforms to a loosely bound complex between planar ammonia and a water molecule, the nitrogen and oxygen atoms as nearest neighbors (binding energy -13.0 kJ/mol). Hydrogen atom transfer along the hydrogen bond from water to ammonia leads to a structure mimicked as a complex between an ammonium and a hydroxyl radical.","","","Univ. of Vienna, Austria","","","United States","1987-04-09T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: J.

Catalysts which did not contain ZnO, namely, CuO/TiO/sub 2/ and CuO/ThO/sub 2/, were relatively inactive. The CuO/ZnO/ThO/sub 2/ and commercial catalysts lost activity and surface area at 325/sup 0/C, while the activity and surface area of the CuO/ZnO/Cr/sub 2/O/sub 3/ catalyst remained constant during 60 h onstream at the same temperature.

The C/sub 4/ alcohol selectivities of the catalysts containing ThO/sub 2/ at 325/sup 0/C were significantly larger than those of the other catalysts.

The most effective among these are the dicationic Ni/sup II/(cyclam)/sup 2 +/ and its unsaturated analogues Ni/sup II/(Me/sub 4/(14)tetraeneN/sub 4/)/sup 2 +/ and Ni/sup II/ (CR)/sup 2 +/ as well as the Schiff base derivatives Ni/sup II/(Tfaced) and Ni/sup II/(Aceted). All of the nickel(II) complexes efficiently convert iodosylbenzene as the terminal oxidant to iodobenzene. However, despite extensive efforts to optimize the solvent, counterions, added donor ligands, and terminal oxidants, the conversions of olefins are restricted to modest yields of epoxides owing to competition from the oxidative attack on the solvent and the ligands. The catalytic activity is tentatively ascribed to an active oxo-nickel(IV) intermediate that is rather indiscriminate in oxygen atom transfer and in homolytic attack on solvent as well as ligand. A spectral transient is assigned to a (..mu..-oxo)nickel(III) dimer arising from the facile association of the putative oxo-nickel(IV) intermediate with the nickel(II) precursor. In these regards, the nickel(II) precursor. In these regards, the nickel catalysis of olefin epoxidation is strongly reminiscent of the behavior of cationic manganese(III) complexes under similar conditions. 48 references, 1 figure, 6 tables.","","","Univ. of Houston, University Park, TX","","","United States","1987-03-25T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: Inorg.

However, it has not been possible to study the catalytic oxidations at high concentrations of both primary alcohols and aldehydes. Cyclohexanol is oxidized to cyclohexanone. All the species in the degradation sequence are closely related.

The surface appears completely metallic and relatively free of adsorbed species in postreaction analysis, even when heavily preoxidized. The kinetics compare favorably with data for high-surface-area Cu/ZnO or Cu-based catalysts, indicating that metallic Cu is the active ingredient in these. The rate is limited by dissociative adsorption of water under their conditions.

As for the composition dependence of the viscosity, a distinct maximum appears near 0.3-0.4 mole fraction of alcohol on all isobars at each temperature. The viscosity maximum shifts gradually to a higher alcohol concentration with increasing temperature and pressure. The isobars of aqueous 2-propanol and 2-methyl-2-propanol solutions have another shallow minimum near 0.9 mole fraction of alcohol below 323 K.

Calculated structures for hydrated electrons are in good agreement with experiment. Structures are predicted for ammonia-, methylamine-, ethylamine-, dimethylamine-, dimethyl ether-, and propane-solvated electrons. Solvation energies for the localized electron correlate moderately well with experimental lambda/sub max/ values and an e/sup -/(H/sub 2/O)/sub 6/ cluster is calculated to be bound relative to a free electron and six water molecules. Spin densities and Fermi contact terms are discussed. The bonding in solvated electrons is found to involve some donation to OH or NH antibonding orbitals, but bond and atom spin polarization play a major role in electron solvation.","","","Friedrich-Alexander-Universitaet Erlangen-Nuernberg, West Germany","","","United States","1987-02-18T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: J.

At the time, the electric utility, Southern California Edison Co was offering attractive long-term prices for power. The sanitation districts in California have extensive experience in collecting and flaring landfill gas to meet the requirements of the Air Quality Management District. Such gas is also frequently sold to be processed into a marketable gas or used to generate electricity with internal combustion engines or gas turbines.

The first considers a direct surface suppression of active catalytic centers by the deposition of carbon. The second proposes a change in a rate constant for one of the steps in the model for the mechanism. Neither proposal has been confirmed experimentally. A variation of the multiple-cycle transient analysis (MCTA) technique has been employed to determine which model is valid. In this study the temperature of the catalyst bed is modulated in the form of a sinusoidal wave. The time-dependent methane signal becomes asymmetric at the transition temperature, 473 K. Comparison between experimental and predicted results demonstrates that the surface suppression model due to carbon deposition does not provide adequate agreement. The hydrogenation of carbon monoxide over Ni/SiO/sub 2/ catalysts at a high H/sub 2//CO ratio has revealed a reversible change in the rate of methane formation at 473 K.","","","Dept. of Chemical Engineering and Materials Science, Syracuse Univ., Syracuse, NY 13244","","","United States","1987-02-01T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: Ind.

A restructuring of the Fe(110) and Fe(100) surfaces, induced by the presence of aluminum oxide and 20 Torr of water vapor, takes place making the restructured surfaces almost as active as the clean Fe(111) plane in the ammonia synthesis reaction (20 atm reactant pressure of hydrogen and nitrogen). The high activity of the restructured surfaces is maintained for over 4 hr of ammonia synthesis. Without the presence of aluminum oxide, treatment of the Fe(110) and Fe(100) surfaces with 20 Torr of water vapor again produces restructured surfaces which are almost as active as the Fe(111) plane for a short period. However, in this case deactivation of the restructured surfaces into the respective clean, unrestructured surfaces occurs within 1 hr of ammonia synthesis. Restructuring of the Fe(111) with 20 Torr of water vapor produces only a slight decrease in ammonia synthesis activity. The enhancement in rate of the restructured Fe(110) and Fe(100) surfaces, with or without aluminum oxide, might be explained by the formation of active surface orientations for ammonia synthesis (i.e., Fe(111) and Fe(211)), which contain C/sub 7/ sites (iron atoms with seven nearest neighbors), during the water vapor treatments. These restructured surfaces are only stable in the ammonia synthesis conditions when aluminum oxide is present. Potassium adsorbed alone or with coadsorbed aluminum oxide exhibits no promotional effects under the water vapor pretreatment conditions used in this study.","","","Lawrence Berkeley National Lab.

Determining parameters are the nature of the promoter and the pressure. The homologation process is believed to proceed (at least partially) via an olefinic intermediate which is subsequently hydroformylated. The exact role of the mixed catalyst (which introduces a synergism in the production of propanol) is still unclear.","","","ENSCS, Strasbourg, France","","","United States","1987-01-01T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: J.

It was found that the relative order of activity for ammonia formation was Fe(111) > Fe(100) > Fe(110). High pressure kinetic results presented here of ammonia synthesis over Fe(210) and Fe(211) surfaces in addition to the Fe(111), Fe(100), and Fe(110) surfaces show that the presence of highly coordinated sites is more important than surface roughness for high catalytic activity. 11 references.","","","Lawrence Berkeley Lab., CA","","","United States","1987-01-01T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: J.

The reaction was demonstrated to involve the reversible metalation of the dimethylamide ligand. Since this observation led to the development of an unprecedented type of catalytic C-C bond-forming process, they wished to explore the generality of such H-D exchange reactions and in particular whether alcohols might be similarly activated. Catalytic H-D exchange in alcohols required elevated temperatures (180-220 /sup 0/C). Nevertheless, heating ethanol-d in the presence of 1 mol % of the ethoxides of Nb, Ta, or Zr did result in exchange as indicated by the appearance of the OH resonance in the /sup 1/H NMR spectrum.

By applying a voltage drop across an underlying solid electrolyte, one should be able to actively alter the oxygen activity on the catalyst surface to sufficiently low values that the adsorbed CO becomes thermodynamically unstable and readily dissociates. 12 references.","","","Stanford Univ., CA","","","United States","1986-12-01T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: J.

For temperatures below 475 K the apparent activation energy is 24 +/- 4 kcal/mol, and the reaction rate approaches zero order in ammonia pressure. At higher temperatures the activation energy decreases, becoming 1 +/- 1 kcal/mol for temperatures above 550 K. Under these conditions the rate of decomposition is linearly dependent on ammonia pressure. The surface composition at 2 x 10/sup -6/ Torr and temperatures between 350 and 600 K was measured by thermal desorption experiments conducted during the steady-state decomposition of ammonia. The results indicate that nitrogen adatoms are the predominant surface species and that the activation energy for nitrogen desorption is 24-26 kcal/mol, independent of the nitrogen coverage. A mechanistic model that had been developed previously was found to describe accurately the pressure and temperature dependence of both the decomposition kinetics and the measured steady-state coverage of nitrogen adatoms. Both the experimental measurements and the mechanistic model indicate that molecular nitrogen is produced by the recombinative desorption of nitrogen adatoms on the platinum surface.","","","California Institute of Technology, Pasadena","","","United States","1986-11-20T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: J.

Energy consumption is high, and improvement in energy efficiency is very important. From the first commercial methanol plant in 1923, the specific energy in methanol plants has been reduced by one-third in the last two decades. Despite the high level of energy integration in modern methanol plants, they remain very large energy consumers. We believe that the high energy consumption for this type of equilibrium process is largely due to the equilibrium itself. After reaction, the nonconverted reactants must be separated from the product, the product is removed by condensation and the reactants are recirculated by a compressor to the reactor. Due to the presence of non-condensable gases, heat transfer coefficients are low in the condensers, and consequently the cooling areas are large. The recycle of the reactants affects the energy consumption unfavorably.","","","Twente Univ. of Technology, Enschede","","","United States","1986-11-01T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: Hydrocarbon Process.; (United States); Journal Volume: 65:11","","Medium: X; Size: Pages: 80-83","","","","Journal ID: CODEN: HYPRA","","","2009-12-17T00:00:00Z","7050086","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/7050086","","Hydrocarbon Process.; (United States)","","65:11"

The thermally controlled reaction is faster and slightly less selective to CH/sub 2/O on the vanadia/TiO/sub 2/ catalyst. In contrast, the incremental photoassisted reaction rate is much lower on the vanadia catalyst than on the molybdena catalyst, which in turn is less photoactive than pure TiO/sub 2/.

Because of their role in this catalytic process, the formation and thermal stability of these centers have been studied in more detail. The (Li/sup +/O/sup -/) centers are present in the Li/MgO powders at temperatures as low as 673 K. They have a positive heat of formation (..delta..H = 3kcal mol/sup -1/); thus, the concentration of the centers increases with increasing temperatures. Upon quenching the powder in liquid O/sub 2/ to 77K, the (Li/sup +/O/sup -/) centers are frozen in and can be detected by EPR spectroscopy. In addition to the (Li/sup +/O/sup -/) centers, the paramagnetic O/sub 2//sup -/ and O/sub 3//sup -/ ions also are present. The latter species is formed by the reaction of O/sup -/ with O/sub 2/ in the solid or on the surface, depending upon the treatment of samples. The (Li/sup +/O/sup -/) centers also may be formed by irradiation of the Li/MgO powders at 77 K with 254-nm light. Both methods of preparation (quenching and irradiation) result in (Li/sup +/O/sup -/) centers which are thermally unstable at temperatures above 200K. This indicates that the centers are formed at isolated substitutional Li/sup +/ ions. By contrast, previous work by Abraham and co-workers has demonstrated that when Li-doped single crystals are quenched from higher temperatures the resulting (Li/sup +/O/sup -/) centers are stable up to 750 K. This remarkably greater stability has been attributed to the presence of substitutional Li/sup +/ in clusters termed microgalaxies.","","","Texas A and M Univ., College Station","","","United States","1986-10-23T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: J.

Synthesis of alcohols on molybdenum-based catalysts, however, was not reported until the authors discovery that mixed alcohols were efficiently produced from CO and H/sub 2/ on alkali-promoted molybdenum catalysts. Other interesting features of Mo catalysts were that they operated well in a CO-rich gas and are resistant to sulfur poisoning. In the initial study in this laboratory, catalysts were prepared by coimpregnation of SiO/sub 2/ with KCl and Mo salts. As the Mo loading was decreased, however, the authors encountered a difficulty in preparing the catalyst with good reproducibility. Hence they have employed different preparations for the Mo-K/SiO/sub 2/ catalysts. In this note they report that sequence of impregnation greatly affects the activity and selectivity. A sequence in which the K is added first, followed by impregnation with (NH/sub 4/)/sub 6/Mo/sub 7/O/sub 24/, gives rise to reproducible preparation of catalysts for alcohol production. 26 references.","","","Univ. of Tokyo, Japan","","","United States","1986-10-01T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: J.

However, the preadsorbed potassium dramatically affected the adsorption behavior of CO/sub 2/ on Pd(100) and it caused significant changes in the electron energy loss spectrum of adsorbed CO/sub 2/. It increased (i) the amount of weakly adsorbed CO/sub 2/, (ii) the rate of CO/sub 2/ adsorption, and (iii) the binding energy of CO/sub 2/, and (iv) it induced the formation of new adsorption states and lowered the activation barrier for dissociation.

The peak temperatures for CO desorption were 624 and 693 K, which are significantly higher than those measured for the clean Pd(100) surface.

This indicates a substantial charge transfer from the potassium-dosed metal to an empty CO/sub 2..pi../* orbital; as a result the bonding and the structure of adsorbed CO/sub 2/ are basically changed.

Turnover frequencies (TOF) were determined based on hydrogen chemisorption data. The TOF's for a particular type of silica increased with decreasing metal dispersion, but for equivalent dispersions the silicas had a marked effect, with TOF's following the sequence Pd/SiO/sub 2/(59) > Pd/SiO/sub 2/(57) > Pd/SiO/sub 2/(01,03). Preliminary results on unsupported Pd show that the activity was less than expected on the basis of particle size. Thus, the silica promotes the activity of the Pd, even though the supported metal particles are relatively large and the TOF increases with particle size. Chloride ions enhance activity by stabilizing higher dispersions and by increasing TOF's. Lithium ions effect extensive sintering of the silica support and promote activity by increasing the TOF. The latter increase may, in part, be the result of more efficient use of Pd surface which occurs via the exclusion of small pores. The more active Pd/SiO/sub 2/ catalysts were found to be comparable in activity to a commercial methanol synthesis catalyst. 14 references.","","","Texas A and M Univ., College Station","","","United States","1986-10-01T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: J.

(5) Both for anions and cations, stepwise replacement of H/sub 2/O by CH/sub 3/OH is exoergic for every step from neat water methanol.

High dispersions were achieved as indicated by chemisorption and XRD measurements. Because of their zero-valent state and the absence of oxygen functional groups on the carbon surface, these catalysts required no high-temperature reduction for activation. The Co/sub 2/(CO)/sub 8//C catalyst was particularly active, produced only paraffins, and exhibited very good activity maintenance, whereas the C-supported Fe/sub 3/(CO)/sub 12/ clusters had the low turnover frequencies and higher olefin/paraffin ratios associated with small Fe crystallites. The mixed-metal cluster catalysts showed intermediate behavior. Addition of one K atom to the clusters markedly decreased specific activity but greatly enhanced selectivity to olefins along with increasing the rate of Co disproportionation. Co, which is known to produce essentially all paraffins, was modified by the K so that it produced only olefins and CH/sub 4/. The K significantly increased activation energies for CO hydrogenation, increased the pressure dependence on H/sub 2/, and made the CO pressure dependency more negative. The variation observed in specific activities indicated that some surface enrichment in Fe may have occurred in the mixed-metal catalysts.","","","Pennsylvania State Univ., University Park","","","United States","1986-09-25T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: J.

It was also found that the yield of C/sub 2/ hydrocarbons on the Bi/sub 2/O/sub 3/ catalysts strongly depended on the support: alumina was most efficient, followed by magnesia, while Bi/sub 2/O/sub 3/ supported on silica and titanium oxide was inactive under the present conditions. When supported on alumina and promoted by potassium, Bi/sub 2/O/sub 3/ was most active and selective followed by SnO/sub 2/ and PbO in that order but Ga/sub 2/O/sub 3/, In/sub 2/O/sub 3/, Tl/sub 2/O/sub 3/, GeO/sub 2/, and Sb/sub 2/O/sub 4/ gave practically no C/sub 2/ hydrocarbons at 640/sup 0/C. The results of the present study and of the hydrogen-exchange reaction between CH/sub 4/ and CD/sub 4/ suggest that the Bi/sub 2/O/sub 3/-K/sub 2/CO/sub 3/-Al/sub 2/O/sub 3/ catalysts catalyze the oxidative coupling reaction as bifunctional catalysts.","","","National Research Council of Canada, Ottawa, Ontario","","","United States","1986-09-25T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: J.

The reaction rate, selectivity, and rate of deactivation for the CO/H/sub 2/ reaction are similar to those for the Fe/Al/sub 2/O/sub 3/ system, but the iron in Fe/C carburizes and decarburizes (in H/sub 2/) much less rapidly than the iron in Fe/Al/sub 2/O/sub 3/. The behavior may be associated with the lack of an active carbide surface species, observed for Fe/Al/sub 2/O/sub 3/ but absent for Fe/C. The reactive intermediate that leads to Fischer-Tropsch products, CH/sub x/ (x = 1 for Fe/Al/sub 2/O/sub 3/), is present in comparable quantities (50 ..mu..mol/g) for both supports, in accord with the similar kinetics observed for the two catalysts.","","","Univ. of Connecticut, Storrs","","","United States","1986-09-25T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: J.

The observations indicate that ruthenium exhibits a stronger interaction with graphite and silica than with titanium oxide. However, when the latter system was preheated in hydrogen at temperatures in excess of 500/sup 0/C, complete suppression of catalytic carbon formation was achieved during subsequent reaction in acetylene.

Ruthenium exhibits an unusual activity pattern for the graphite-oxygen reaction which is associated with the existence of an oxide state at temperatures below 1000/sup 0/C and the metal at higher temperatures. In this regard it resembles iridium and rhodium, but differs from platinum and palladium, which remain in the metallic state throughout the gasification sequence.

Elemental potassium does not remain on a Fe(100) surface under reaction conditions but a small amount of potassium can be stabilized by coadsorption with oxygen. The presence of the stabilized K + O has no effect on the rate of ammonia synthesis. Substantially more potassium can be stabilized at higher temperatures on Fe(100), Fe(111), and Fe(110) surfaces by coadsorption with aluminum oxide.

Paul used thermo sagaciously in his research, and when reliable values were not available, he determined the required data. The energetics for producing a vast array of organic molecules by hydrogenating oxides of carbon are favorable. However, if the possible products are assumed to be in equilibrium, the predominant and nearly only product is methane. Thus, to make higher paraffins, olefins, alcohols, etc. the catalyst must be selective. Part of this selectivity arises from selective poisoning of the catalyst by CO. Similarly, equilibrium is usually not attained in the water gas shift, except for some conditions with catalysts containing Fe, Mo, and W. Hence, the distribution of product should be of great diagnostic value for interpreting the mechanisms of the Fischer-Tropsch and higher alcohol syntheses.","","","McMaster Univ., Hamilton, Ontario","","","United States","1986-09-25T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: J.

Emmett's pioneering work, much research was focused on the mechanisms of Fischer-Tropsch catalysis, and it has been discovered that certain base metal ions promote the activity and selectivity of Rh metal to catalyze the conversions of CO + H/sub 2/ to aldehydes and alcohols. Recent IR, Moessbauer, and EXAFS evidence in conjunction with catalytic tests suggests that the highly oxophilic ions Mn, Ti, Zr, and Nb, when located at the Rh surface, enhance CO dissociation, possibly through direct interaction with the oxygen atom of tilted adsorbed CO. A different mechanism emerges for Fe and Zn ions. These seem to block sites, thus inhibiting the formation of bridging CO and its dissociation to C + O. These steps are characterized by large ensemble requirements. Remarkably, the rate of CO insertion on Rh appears enhanced but the rate of hydrogenation is markedly suppressed by Zn. Consequently, the hydroformylation of olefins and the synthesis of methanol are efficiently catalyzed. This result suggests that the latter reactions require only very small Rh ensembles; possibly they are catalyzed by single Rh atoms.","","","Northwestern Univ., Evanston, IL","","","United States","1986-09-25T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: J.

From measurements of activity and selectivity for CO hydrogenation at 1 atm, H/sub 2//CO = 2 and 450-530 K, it is evident that initial and steady-state specific activities and the olefin/paraffin ratio decrease with decreasing metal crystallite size. The activity of well-dispersed Fe/C decreases very significantly with time at a H/sub 2//CO ratio of 2. Moessbauer spectroscopy data provide evidence that small superparamagnetic clusters of iron metal are the predominant iron phases of 1% and 3% Fe/carbon.

Over a range of Si/Al ratios from 4.7 to 255 the cracking activity increased in a linear manner with respect to the number of lattice Al ions per unit cell. Thus, a constant turnover frequency is obtained, which is taken as evidence that the acid strength does not vary over this range of Si/Al ratios. By contrast, a zeolite prepared by deamination of NH/sub 4/-Y was very much less active than expected on the basis of the number of protonic sites. The acidity of the protons in this material is clearly less than in the dealuminated zeolite. These results support a model of strong Broensted acidity in which a structural aluminum atom has no next-nearest aluminum neighbors in a common 4-ring of the zeolite.","","","Texas A and M Univ., College Station","","","United States","1986-09-25T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: J.

Experimental results described in this paper were carried out in the framework of a more general study undertaken in order to develop an industrial process for the abatement of NO/sub x/ emissions from nitric acid plants. The catalyst used was NiO-CuO/..gamma..lt. slash-Al/sub 2/O/sub 3/ and the reactions studied were NO reduction with NH/sub 3/ (in the presence and absence of oxygen) and NH/sub 3/ oxidation with oxygen, both at atmospheric pressure and in the temperature range between 200 and 300/sup 0/C. A kinetic equation was developed by using three different reaction models. This equation fits the experimental results in the above-mentioned temperature range very well, but at high temperatures experimental values clearly deviate from the model predictions. The paper ends by discussing current data in the literature and the experimental evidence obtained in this work in order to postulate a more complex mechanism for the NO reduction with NH/sub 3/ on oxide-supported catalysts. This discussion pointed out possible new lines of research in order to clarify the physical chemistry of the oxidation-reduction system involved in detail.","","","CSIC, Madrid, Spain","","","United States","1986-09-25T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: J.

The reductions proceed via the nitrosyl complex (Fe/sup II/(NO/sup +/)(TPPS))/sup 3 -/ as an intermediate. The nitrosyl complex forms at pH < 3.0 by a reaction between the Fe(III) porphyrin and NO arising from disproportionation of HONO or, at 4.0 < pH > 7.0, following reduction of Fe(III) to Fe(II) (E/sub 1/2/ = -0.23 V vs. SSCE) via an acid-base reaction. Reduction of the nitrosyl complex occurs by sequential 1-electron steps at E/sub 1/2/ = +0.35 and -0.63 V vs. SSCE, the second of which is pH-dependent at pH < 2.6. Evidence for a third 1-electron step has been found by differential pulse polarography at pH 2.1. The first two reductions are followed by a multiple-electron wave which is greatly enhanced as the pH is decreased from 4 to 2.6. Although NH/sub 3/ is the ultimate reduction product at -0.9 V, NH/sub 2/OH appears to be an intermediate stage in the reduction and electrolysis to the 2-electron stage at -0.63 V gives increasing yields of N/sub 2/O.

The reaction between trans-PtHCl(PMe/sub 3/)/sub 2/ (where Me = CH/sub 3/) and sodium hydroxide in a one-to-one mixture of water and 1-hexene yields a species that, at 60/sup 0/C and in the presence of the phase-transfer catalyst benzyltriethylammonium chloride, catalyzes selective hydration of 1-hexene to n-hexanol at a rate of 6.9 +/- 0.2 turnovers per hour. Hydration of 1-dodecene to n-dodecanol occurs at a rate of 8.3 +/- 0.4 turnovers per hour at 100/sup 0/C. Deuterium labeling experiments with trans-PtDCl(PMe/sub 3/)/sub 2/ show that hydration involves reductive elimination of a C-H bond. At low hydroxide concentrations (<8 equivalents), hydration of the water-soluble olefin 3-butene-1-ol to 1,4-butanediol exhibited a first-order dependence on hydroxide concentration for loss of catalytic activity. This suggest that hydroxide attacks the coordinated alkene slowly. At high hydroxide concentrations, the rate of catalysis was hydroxide-independent and first-order in alkene. Substitution of coordinated water (k/sub 1/ = 9.3 +/- 0.5 x 10/sup -3/ liters per mol per second) appears to be limiting under these conditions.","","","Univ. of California at San Diego, La Jolla","","","United States","1986-09-05T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: Science (Washington, D.C.); (United States); Journal Volume: 233","","Medium: X; Size: Pages: 1069-1070","","","","Journal ID: CODEN: SCIEA","10.1126/science.233.4768.1069","","2016-04-26T00:00:00Z","6928205","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/6928205","","Science (Washington, D.C.); (United States)","","233"

Hydrido alkylidene complexes, generated by a 1,2-hydrogen shift from metal alkyls, have been postulated to play an important role in the metathesis and polymerization of olefins, while surface-bound vinyldene species have been detected and recently proposed to account for linear/branched hydrocarbon distributions in Fischer-Tropsch synthesis. The third member of the class described here, L/sub n/M(H)(=O), is of fundamental importance in reactions involving H/sub 2/O, O/sub 2/, or peroxides. Although an example of an oxo hydride has not previously been reported, several oxo alkyl species have been characterized recently. The authors have described the preparation of a number of permethyltantalocene derivatives and commented on the remarkable stability conferred by two pentamethylcyclopentadienyl ligands. This important facet and a general reluctance for permethyl-metallocene derivatives to undergo oligomerization processes have allowed us to prepare and investigate the reaction chemistry of a number of monomeric hydrido derivatives of general formula Cp*/sub 2/ Ta(H)(=X) (Cp* = eta/sup 5/-C/sub 5/Me/sub 5/; X = CH/sub 2/ (1), C = CH/sub 2/.

In the former case they provide the covalent stabilization of the Zn/sup 2 +/-H/sup ./ bond and in the latter case they are reduced, allowing a strong O/sup 2 -/-H/sup +/ bond to form. Because of this, H/sub 2/ adsorbs heterolytically, yielding Zn/sup 2 +/-H/sup -/ and O/sup 2 -/-H/sup +/ as the products of dissociative chemisorption. The findings, which are based on calculations on a Zn/sub 14/O/sub 14/ cluster model, including surface relaxation, of the (10-10) surface are used to discuss the conductivities of the polar (0001) and (000-1) cleavage surfaces, the former consisting of Zn/sup 2 +/ and the latter of O/sup 2 -/.

Independent cost estimates for a plant using the new process are considerably lower than those for a corresponding plant based on present technology. The group at Brookhaven believes it has overcome most of the objections to steam reforming and the high capital investment in partial oxidation processes. The key factor is a new methanol synthesis catalyst. The researchers declined to identify the catalyst other than to say that it is a liquid solution that provides synthesis gas conversion of more than 90%, is active at low temperatures (around the normal boiling point of water), and permits removal of heat to be decoupled from the process kinetics. The new BNL catalyst, which is being developed with funding from the Department of Energy, makes it possible to take advantage of the unique natural gas requirements for partial oxidation because the high conversion rates eliminate the need for recycle. That permits the use of air and eliminates concerns about inert gas buildup. Atmospheric nitrogen, in the oxidation air, leaves the process at elevated pressure and can be expanded to extract compressor power. What that suggests to the BNL group is the possibility of being able to use methanol, rather than LNG, to transport natural gas energy to the marketplace.","","","","","","United States","1986-08-04T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: Chem.

Under flow reaction conditions two forms of adsorbed methyl formate exist. One has a carbonyl absorption at 1726 cm/sup -1/ and is bound to the support by the hydrogen bonding with a heat of adsorption of 65 kJ mol/sup -1/. The second absorbs at 1666 cm/sup -1/ and is bound to copper with an approximate heat of adsorption of 140 kJ mol/sup -1/. At 457 K the hydrogenolysis rate is directly proportional to the band intensity of the latter and hence it, or another species in equilibrium with it, is involved in the rate-determining step. Adsorption of CO from CO/H/sub 2/ mixtures gives rise to a single infrared band at 2117 cm/sup -1/, the corresponding heat of adsorption being 60 kJ mol/sup -1/. Competitive measurements under hydrogenolysis conditions show that methyl formate will partially displace adsorbed CO and not vice versa. Nonetheless CO does reversibly inhibit the rate and this is attributed to its adsorption displacing hydrogen from the surface. The lower concentration of surface hydrogen also reduces the rate of hydrogenation of a formaldehyde intermediate leading to its deposition as a polymer as revealed by infrared bands at 1483 and 1375 cm/sup -1/. The same polymer accretes more rapidly during the reverse methanol to methyl formate reaction for which CO is a substantial by-product and hydrogen pressures are much lower than used for hydrogenolysis. Continuous deactivation of the catalyst is then observed.","","","Macquarie Univ., North Ryde, Australia","","","United States","1986-07-01T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: J.

Unlabeled and labeled methyl formates (CH/sub 3/OCDO and CD/sub 3/OCHO) react with hydrogen and deuterium at identical rates. The product distribution is that expected for successive simple additions without exchange at methyl or aldehyde positions (e.g., the initial products of the reaction between CH/sub 3/OCHO and D/sub 2/ are CH/sub 3/OD and CHD/sub 2/OD). The only complication is a rapid transesterification equilibrium (e.g., CH/sub 3/OCHO + CHD/sub 2/OD in equilibrium CHD/sub 2/ + CH/sub 3/OD. Control experiments show that this process, and a similarly rapid CH/sub 3/OH + D/sub 2/ in equilibrium CH/sub 3/OD + HD equilibration, are catalyzed by copper and not the silica support. The mechanism suggested for hydrogenolysis involves formation of a surface hemiacetal species which, on cleavage of the C-O bond, gives surface methoxy groups and formaldehyde. It is unclear if the slow step is this bond cleavage or the addition step which forms the intermediate. During reaction between CH/sub 3/OCHO and H/sub 2//D/sub 2/ mixtures equilibration to HD is 10 to 30 times faster than hydrogenolysis. Added CO inhibits both hydrogenolysis and equilibration but the latter is inhibited to a greater extent. Both effects can be explained in terms of the displacement of adsorbed hydrogen by adsorbed CO with equilibration being affected more because of its higher kinetic order in adsorbed hydrogen. The lower concentration of surface hydrogen concentration in the presence of CO also reduces the rate of hydrogenation of the formaldehyde intermediate causing its diversion into a polymeric by-product which poisons the catalyst.","","","Macquarie Univ., North Ryde, Australia","","","United States","1986-07-01T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: J.

The relations obtained may be used to calculate the concentration of nitrogen oxides and nitrogen-containing components in the combustion products of enriched mixtures with bound nitrogen and give a correct qualitative description of experimental laws.","","","","","","United States","1986-07-01T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: Combust., Explos.

It has been established that, in the course of irradiation, a photocatalytic process develops with the participation of coordination compounds of titanium(IV) and (III), resulting in oxidation and breakdown of the ethanol to form acetaldehyde, methane, ethane, ethyl chloride, and molecular hydrogen. In the presence of small amounts of added water (up to 0.5 M), the efficiency of CH/sub 4/ and C/sub 2/H/sub 6/ formation is much lower but the yield of H/sub 2/ is higher, in comparison with the yields of these products in absolute ethanol. With further increases in the water concentration, the rates of formation of methane, ethane, and acetaldehyde increase. The maximum quantum yields (..sigma..) are as follows: ..sigma..(CH/sub 4/) = 1.8 x 10/sup -4/ and ..sigma..(C/sub 2/H/sub 6/) = 1 x 10/sup -3/ in absolute ethanol; ..sigma..(CH/sub 3/CHO) = 1.6 x 10/sup -2/ in ethanol with the addition of 6.0 M H/sub 2/O; ..sigma..(H/sub 2/) = 6.7 x 10/sup -3/ in solutions containing 0.5 M H/sub 2/O. The observed differences in the product yields are explained by a change in the composition and structure of the titanium compounds that act as the photocatalyst, a change that takes place when the water concentration is varied. A mechanism is proposed for these reactions.","","","L. V.

The extent (theta) of NH/sub 3/ adsorption on clean Ni and Pd films at 193 K was greater by 20 to 30% than that attained on films which had been covered with hydrogen at 300 K. Extensive NH/sub 3/ adsorption also occurred at 193 K on surfaces of Ni, Pd, and Al which had been saturated with oxygen at 300 K.

The activation energies (E/sub a/) of NH/sub 3/ adsorption increased rapidly over a small range of theta values ultimately attaining a constant value at saturation. From the values of E/sub a/ and by use of the appropriate rates and temperatures of adsorption, the values of the preexponential factor (A) of the rate equation were determined. A linear relationship existed between log A and E/sub a/, suggesting the operation of a compensation effect in the interaction of NH/sub 3/ with different surfaces.

Investigations of early metal hydride reactivity have resulted in reagents useful in organic synthesis and modeling studies relevant to the Fischer-Tropsch process. A variety of group 5 hydrides have been described; the majority contain ancillary phosphine and/or cyclopentadienyl ligands that tend to electronically and sterically saturate the early metal center. By introducing an ancillary ligand system with electronic properties dissimilar to the a atforementioned strong sigma-donors, the reactivity and structural properties common to these metal hydrides may be altered. Reported herein are syntheses and selected reactions of group 5 hydrides ligated by tri-tert-butylsiloxide (t-Bu/sub 3/SiO/sup -/, silox), which has been shown to sterically saturate metal centers while leaving them electron deficient.","","","Cornell Univ., Ithaca, NY","","","United States","1986-06-11T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: J.

Introduction of the promoter following the preparation of the Pd/SiO/sub 2/ catalyst results in a partial coverage of the Pd particles by the oxide promoter. Upon reduction of the promoted catalysts, portions of the promoter in contact with Pd undergo reduction. The partially reduced rare earth oxide species covering the Pd particles reduce the amounts of H/sub 2/ and CO that can be adsorbed on the metal. The rare earth oxide moieties have a slight influence on the distribution of H/sub 2/ adstates but cause a significant change in the distribution of CO adstates. Decoration of Pd by rare earth oxide moieties also aids the dissociation of CO, and raises thereby the activity for CH/sub 4/ synthesis relative to that for Pd/SiO/sub 2/.

In particular, metals supported on TiO/sub 2/ have attracted attention due to the observation that activity and selectivity for Fischer-Tropsch synthesis can be altered, depending on the temperature at which the metal-TiO/sub 2/ composite is reduced.

Commissioned in August 1985, the 1200 ton/day plant uses new, energy-efficient technology developed by C-I-L and its British-based parent, ICI. The plant is controlled by a combination of Honeywell TDC 2000 and a C-I-L developed Cygnus supervisory control system. The simulator contains computer-based models of the actual ammonia plant units and control systems. Similar to systems used in the airline and aerospace industries, it enables trainees to practice operating the plant, in normal as well as critical operating conditions, without risk. Commissioning manager Bill Taylor says that significant contribution to the success of the start-up was made by the extensive pretraining of operating personnel using the simulator, which exactly duplicated the operation of the plant in real-time response. Training involving more than 100 simulated trip situations eased operators' transition from pneumatic to Cygnus and the TDC 2000 video display control system.

Two possible mechanisms for the formation of this alkenyldiazenido complex are proposed. (1) Ligating dinitrogen is first protonated by acetylacetone to form the diazenido complex (W(acac)(NNH)(PMe/sub 2/Ph)/sub 3/). The nucleophilic addition of the diazenido ligand to one of the carbonyl groups in acetylacetone followed by elimination of water results in the formation of the alkenyldiazenido complex. (2) The dinitrogen complex is converted into the hydrazido(2-) complex (W(acac)(NNH/sub 2/)(PMe/sub 2/Ph)/sub 3/)(acac) via the diazenido complex by protonation with acetylacetone. The condensation of this hydrazido(2-) complex with acetylacetone gives the diazoalkane complex (W(acac)(NN=CMeCH/sub 2/COMe)(PMe/sub 2/Ph)/sub 3/)(acac), which is readily transformed into the alkenyldiazenido complex by abstraction of the active methylene proton with the acetylacetonate anion in the outer coordination sphere.","","","Univ. of Tokyo, Japan","","","United States","1986-04-02T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: J.

Ethanol is a proven gasoline extender and octane improver, and the ENSOL process enables ethanol to be produced at a very attractive price (65-90 cents/U.S. gallon) using natural gas as a feedstock. The basic arrangement of an ENSOL ethanol plant is given, from which it may be seen that the flowsheet divides conveniently into two parts: the methanol production unit and the main ethanol units. The methanol unit has the usual sections except that there is no need to produce AA grade and hence no need for the second distillation column, which is normally employed to remove ethanol from methanol.

Experiments were performed on diffusion flames stabilized between the vaporizing surface of a liquid fuel and an oxidizing gas mixture. Liquid fuels tested were heptane, toluene, methanol, ethanol, and butanol, and a number of homogeneous solutions of these fuels in different proportions. Experimental results were interpreted by use of an asymptotic theory in the limit for a large value for the activation energy characterizing the gas-phase chemical reaction between each component of the fuel in the fuel solution and the oxidizer when compared with the thermal energy in the flame. The theory was used to compare the relative reactivities of pure fuels and fuel mixtures. The influence of alcohols (methanol, ethanol, and butanol) on the reactivities of hydrocarbon fuel solutions was evaluted by this method. Results show that methanol is more reactive than ethanol or butanol. Results on pure fuels show that toluene is less reactive than heptane, ethanol, butanol, and methanol. It was observed that the reactivity of a fuel solution containing heptane and toluene increased with increasing proportion of methanol.","","","Department of Applied Mechanics and Engineering Science/Chemical Engineering, University of California at San Diego, La Jolla, CA 92093","","","United States","1986-04-01T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: Combust.

The metals included ruthenium, rhodium, palladium, rhenium, osmium, iridium, platinum, and gold. Ammonia and methane were observed as products on all of the metals investigated. Dimethylamine was formed in significant amounts over all the metals except rhodium. Various other products were also observed on certain metals. With regard to the kinds of products formed, the results of the present work are in excellent agreement with previously published results on catalysts in the form of metal films. In addition to extending the earlier work on metal films to supported metals, the present work includes data on several additional metals as well. When the present results are combined with their earlier reported results on ethane hydrogenolysis, the authors are able, for a common series of metals, to compare patterns of variation of catalytic activity for the hydrogenolysis of carbon-carbon and carbon-nitrogen bonds. Such a comparison is of interest in the general question of the catalytic specificity of metals.","","","Exxon Research and Engineering Co., Annandale, NJ (USA)","","","United States","1986-04-01T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: J.

Stepwise transfer of hydrogens to coordinated CO and chain growth by CO insertion provide the primary pathway for the construction of higher alcohols over metal oxide catalysts. The insertion of a carbon monoxide into a surface-bound aldehyde is proposed as the primary carbon-carbon bond forming step in the chain growth. A competing carbon-carbon bond-forming step is the reaction of a surface n/sup 3/-enolate with a surface alkoxide. This condensation reaction is critical for providing product distributions deviating from those predicted by simple polymerization schemes. A novel rationale is proposed to explain the selectivity to branched products. The relative stabilities of the enolate precursors to the various alcohols and the relative rates of the 1,2-shift reactions of methyl and hydrogen are the rate-controlling mechanistic features which regulate selective formation of branched higher alcohol products. The mechanism is related to the dehydration of secondary alcohols to 1-olefins catalyzed by basic metal oxides.","","","Standard Oil Co., Independence, OH (USA)","","","United States","1986-03-01T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: J.

Oxidative regenerations did not succeed in returning the catalyst to its initial synthesis activity. X-ray diffraction analysis of the used and regenerated catalyst samples suggested that sintering of the cobalt occurred.

The various species formed after activation at various temperatures, rehydration, and adsorption of various molecules are characterized by electron spin resonance (ESR) and electron spin echo modulation (ESEM) experiments. Two dominant species, termed A and C, are studied in detail. Species A is generated at lower activation temperature than is species C. At intermediate activation temperatures the total Rh spin concentration decreases which is attributed to Rh dimer formation. At higher activation temperatures the total Rh spin concentration increase is consistent with dimer decomposition. Species A is suggested to be located in the ..beta..-cage and species C in the hexagonal prisms of the zeolite X structure based on interaction distances with adsorbates and on the effect of O/sub 2/ on broadening the ESR lines. Rather large distances to water, methanol, and other adsorbates are obtained from the ESEM measurements which suggest that these Rh species are not directly coordinated to the adsorbates. Complete rehydration generates other Rh species which show shorter distances to water characteristic of direct coordination. 33 references, 8 figures, 4 tables.","","","Univ. of Houston, TX","","","United States","1986-01-16T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: J.

The experimental results show that good separation of the impurities is achieved in the capillary column where the impurities were separated. The relative retention volumes of the components are given. The best separation is achieved at 50 mm pressure. At this pressure the content of higher alcohols in ethyl alcohol is lowered by rectification from 1.5.10/sup -1/ to 5.10/sup -4/ vol. %.

Cobalt, supported on titania, was rather easy to oxidize and subsequently hard to reduce. Because of this ease of oxidation, during passivation a considerable amount of cobalt was oxidized. The reduction of Co/sub 3/O/sub 4/ supported on TiO/sub 2/ proceeded in two stages, namely a primary reduction of Co/sub 3/O/sub 4/ to CoO and a subsequent reduction of CoO to Co. The addition of rhodium to cobalt caused the resulting bimetallic catalyst to be more difficult to oxidize, while the reducibility of the catalyst depended on the oxidation temperature. When oxidized below 800 K, the reduction proceeded at low temperatures, indicating that Rh/sub 2/O/sub 3/ was present in the surface of the bimetallic particles. To complete the oxidation, however, higher temperatures were needed and under these circumstances cobalt rhodate, CoRh/sub 2/O/sub 4/, was formed.

TPR of the coimpregnated Co-Rh/..gamma..-Al/sub 2/O/sub 3/ catalyst shows a reduction peak at a much lower temperature than that of Co/Al/sub 2/O/sub 3/. This and the slight shift relative to the peak of Rh/Al/sub 2/O/sub 3/ indicates that cobalt and rhodium ions are not far apart after coimpregnation, which explains the easy formation of bimetallic particles during reduction. Passivation (oxidation at room temperature) of the reduced bimetallic catalyst leaves the structure the bimetallic particles largely intact, but cobalt is oxidized to a great extent while rhodium remains metallic. Passivated Co-Rh particles thus consist of a rhodium kernel covered by cobalt oxide. TPR of passivated catalysts also suggests that already in the reduced state the bimetallic particles are surface-enriched in cobalt. A thorough oxidation of the bimetallic catalysts, on the other hand, leads to a restructuring, i.e., the formation of metal oxide particles which are in close proximity.","","","Eindhoven Univ. of Technology (Netherlands)","","","United States","1986-01-01T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: J.

Nevertheless, H/sub 2/ is often a by-product in plants producing CO-rich syngas. The production of excess H/sub 2/ results from keeping the process conditions away from the potential for carbon formation. The excess hydrogen is burned as fuel, resulting in an overall lower energy efficiency of the unit.

There has been much discussion recently about the mechanism of synthesis on these catalysts and it is clearly not yet fully understood. Indeed there is still controversy about the nature of the active sites and more specifically about the chemical state of the copper component during methanol synthesis. It seems that more than one mechanism may lead to methanol but that under the conditions usually employed industrially, i.e., with synthesis gases containing both CO and CO/sub 2/, the hydrogenation of CO/sub 2/ predominates (7,8) and copper is the active component. In this report N/sub 2/O chemisorption data are presented from in situ studies on a commercial CuO/ZnO/Al/sub 2/O/sub 3/ (60:30:10) methanol synthesis catalyst which has been operating in microreactor systems at pressures up to 100 atm.

This reactor can be used to measure the rate of heat generation, study the thermal behavior, and obtain kinetic data over a range of operating conditions for slurry-phase hydroprocessing reactions. The thermal behavior of the synthesis gas conversion was used as a case study using a supported ruthenium catalyst. Effects of reaction temperature, pressure, feed composition, and intensity of mixing on the thermal behavior and steady-state multiplicity of a three-phase semicontinuous synthesis gas conversion are examined. Increase in slurry temperature, gas space velocity, and H/sub 2//CO ratio and decrease in stirrer speed and operating pressure resulted in higher methane production and rate of heat generation. Steady-state multiplicity in terms of product distribution and rate of heat generation was found. The cause of multiplicity is believed to be a shift in reaction mechanism on the catalyst particle. Temperatures above 560 K may switch the reactor from synthesis mode to methanation mode (high H/sub 2//CO ratio) or to deactivation mode (low H/sub 2//CO ratio). Higher space velocity shrinks the region of multiplicity, and higher operating pressure eliminates it. On the basis of the results, some important control problems for a commercial synthesis gas conversion slurry reactor are discussed.","","","Dept. of Chemical and Petroleum Eng., Univ. of Pittsburgh, PA 15261","","","United States","1986-01-01T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: Ind.

Some of them have focused on the nature of the active Cu site(s) but the subject is still rather controversial. All researchers find metallic Cu as the predominant Cu species on Cu/ZnO/Al/sub 2/O/sub 3/ and Cu/ZnO/Cr/sub 2/O/sub 3/ catalysts during methanol synthesis; however, the amount and catalytic importance of the small concentrations of Cu/sup +/ accompanying Cu is at the center of a controversy. The amount of Cu/sup +/ ions present during methanol synthesis can depend, among other things, on catalyst composition, gas composition (e.g., presence of CO/sub 2/H/sub 2/O), and reaction conditions. The authors discuss the results of their previous studies. The authors believe that there is sufficient evidence in the literature that completely reduced Cu-based catalysts are very good methanol synthesis catalysts. Thus, metallic copper sites must be active sites for this reaction. On the other hand, there is also evidence of incomplete copper reduction under certain reaction conditions leading to a mixture of mainly Cu and some Cu/sup +/. The question of whether Cu/sup +/ is another or even a much more active site for methanol formation than Cu has not yet been answered. It would have been interesting if Chinchen and Waugh had shown a correlation between the performance of their catalysts and the amount of surface oxidized copper. In their own work, attempts to correlate methanol synthesis rates with relative amounts of Cu and Cu/sup +/ were not successful because the reduction of CuO to Cu was completed at the onset of measurable CO conversion at about 130/sup 0/C. The authors did, however, observe Cu/sup +/ as intermediate in the reduction of Cu/sup 2 +/ to Cu and, as already mentioned, after only minute air exposure of used catalysts. 17 references.","","","Amoco Corp., Naperville, IL (USA)","","","United States","1986-01-01T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: J.

Small but significant reductions in product cost can be made by increasing the conversion per pass and heat recovery from the synthesis reactor. However, the overall performance of the process is limited by the high cost and thermal inefficiencies associated with the steam reforming step used to produce the synthesis gas. Catalytic partial oxidation (CPO) of methane directly to methanol has a potential advantage over the conventional process in that it eliminates the need for steam reforming.

Between about 400 and 550 K highly dispersed Cu metal clusters appear, while metal clusters with metal-oxygen bonding exist below 400 K. Since this catalyst is used industrially around 550 K, the former should be regarded as the carrier of catalytic activity for the system. However, once this catalyst is heated above its active region, the Cu clusters coalesce into large crystalline particles and the change with heating/cooling cycles ceases to be reversible. This provides a rationale for a well-known loss of activity when this catalyst is operated at high temperatures.

Inhibition of the decomposition is observed at relatively high total pressures (0.2-0.6 torr) for all temperatures studied. The reaction orders with respect to hydrogen and ammonia are -1.5 and 1.0, respectively, with an apparent activation energy of 38 kcal/mol. For relatively low total pressures (10 T-5 x 10 T torr), inhibition is only observed at temperatures below 650 K, where the activation energy varies from 33 to 55 kcal/mol and the reaction order with respect to hydrogen approaches -1.5 at low temperatures. The decomposition becomes uninhibited at high temperatures and the activation energy is 4.5 kcal/mol. The kinetics of this reaction as well as previous results for the NH3 + D2 exchange reaction are described quantitatively by a mechanistic model employing independently measured adsorption-desorption parameters of NH3, N2 and H2, where the rate coefficient for hydrogen desorption is a function of the fractional surface coverage of nitrogen adatoms.

Experiments distilling methanol-water mixtures have verified those predictions for periodic cycling with a single plate. The extension of the theory to multiple-plate columns fails in usual distillation apparatus due to liquid mixing during the liquid flow period. To overcome this problem a new tray design consisting of a sieve plate and inclined surfaces has introduced an effective liquid time delay. Although the predicted efficiencies of 200% were not realized due to vapor movement hindering the tray action, a wide range of operating conditions provided good overall column efficiencies of 140%.","","","Department of Chemical Engineering, University of Sydney, NSW","","","United States","1985-10-01T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: A.E.Ch.E.

The procedure has been applied to combustion at constant volume varying over a wide range of air-fuel ratios, percentage of alcohol, and combustion temperature. The results obtained, of particular interest for reciprocating internal combustion engines, indicate that as far as energy and emissions are concerned, the effects of alcohol on combustion depend strongly on the hypothesis adopted for fueling the alcohol.","","","Department of energetics, University of L'Aquila","","","United States","1985-10-01T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: J.

The ZnO surfaces are poor donors and function primarily as acceptors of electron density from CO.

It was found that a reinterpretation of the reduction process is necessary. The most striking result was the detection of open circuit (dark) reduction of carbon dioxide to methanol. This occurred at the rate of 0.1 ..mu..mol/(h cm/sup 2/) on the As face of the heavily doped p-type GaAs. A slightly higher rate (50%) was observed for moderately doped n-type crystal. Some formaldehyde production was also seen but at a much smaller rate (1/5). It was determined that this rate is constant with surface area and time. A measurement on the opposite face (Ga) showed very little methanol production. It was also determined that damaging the surface greatly reduced methanol production while increasing the amount of formaldehyde. Closed circuit measurements under cathodic bias showed reduction of carbon dioxide as indicated by the disappearance of hydrogen bubbles when the carbon dioxide gas was introduced. The product was almost certainly formic acid as no additional methanol or formaldehyde (over the open circuit results) was detected at either high current (10 mA) or low current (0.2 mA). 25 references, 5 figures, 1 table.","","","Simon Fraser Univ., Burnaby, British Columbia","","","United States","1985-07-18T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: J.

A disadvantage is that methanol containing gasolines tend to separate into layers at low temperatures, particularly if water is present. The problem can be overcome by the addition of aliphatic alcohols such as isobutanol but this is expensive and must therefore be done sparingly. This article presents a simple method of determining the phase stability of various methanol containing gasolines. Phase stability varies with synthetic component content and with the hydrocarbon content of the base naphtha. A mathematical model based on cloud point data for various mixtures produces a set of diagrams from which phase stabilities can be readily obtained.","","","Blagonravov State Scientific Research Institute of Mechanical Engineering, Moscow, USSR","","","United States","1985-07-01T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: Chem.

About the only point of agreement of all these studies are that the amount of these fuels are finite, that they are unequally distributed, and that their impact on the world's financial markets are creating extreme hardships in many countries. For these reasons, the production of synthetic fuels, where possible, for domestic consumption appears to be only the question of when and in what form. Nearly all estimates show that synthetic fuels are going to cost more than conventional fuels on a cost-per-unit energy basis. In addition, the most viable source of feedstock for synthetic gases or liquids is another unequally distributed fossil product-coal. The high capital requirements, high cost and low availability of money, and long construction times for most synthetic fuel plants make them an unsatisfactory solution to countries with existing, overwhelming debts and import/export problems. Underground coal gasification, at its current state of development, shows promise of meeting nearly all the desired characteristics except for definition of the risks that accompany large scale operation.

To optimize the selectivity, the catalyst series contains various proportions of molybdenum oxide and sulfide, promoters such as alkali carbonate,and group VIII sulfides. By manipulating catalyst and process variables, the methanol to higher alcohols ratio in the product can be varied from 90:10 to 0:100. Less than 2% water is formed, which can be removed economically using conventional drying technology. Fixed bed and fluid bed reactors have been operated. Fixed bed conversions of 20-25% per pass have been demonstrated, with 85% of CO/sub 2/-free carbon recovered as alcohols. Maximum selectivity occurs at lower conversion. Pressure range is from 1000-3000 psi at temperatures of 480-570/sup 0/F. The catalysts are highly productive, resistant to coking, sulfur tolerant, and mechanically durable. Catalyst regeneration was determined to be unnecessary. Heat transfer characteristics, stability criteria, mass transfer analysis at the gas-catalyst interface, and kinetic models were formulated to develop a complete scale-up package for the fixed bed. Synthesis gas for the reaction may be obtained by partial oxidation of natural gas, high sulfur residuals, or coal.","","","","","","United States","1985-04-01T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: Chem.

Because of poor product selectivity and low production rates, direct syngas mechanisms are not commercially viable. Specific examples of indirect methanol-based routes and also routes from formaldehyde are given. These include the production of ethanol by reductive carbonylation of methanol and the production of vinyl acetate, although more work needs to be done on the methanol-syngas route to vinyl acetate. The chemistry of ethylene glycol from formaldehyde is discussed. It is concluded that the success of syngas-based technologies will be linked to the economics of ethylene production and new methanol-based processes will contribute to this success. 35 references.","","","","","","United States","1985-04-01T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: CHEMTECH; (United States); Journal Volume: 15:4","","Medium: X; Size: Pages: 244-251","","","","Journal ID: CODEN: CHTED","","","2009-12-17T00:00:00Z","6158782","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/6158782","","CHEMTECH; (United States)","","15:4"

Storage tests were undertaken to obtain data on optimal storage requirements and general stability characteristics. Samples were kept at three temperature levels (20 C, 30C and fluctuating around 50 C) for a 90-day period and were removed at regular intervals for chemical and physical analysis. The influence of air, temperature, light, TBHQ and contact with mild steel was evaluated by comparing the free fatty acid, peroxide, anisidine, ultraviolet absorption, viscosity and inducation periods. A statistical model was used to evaluate the data and to reduce the data points to comparable curves. Storage of esters in contact with air, especially at a temperature above 30 C, resulted in significant increases in peroxide, ultraviolet absorption, free fatty acid, viscosity and anisidine values. Exclusion of air retarded oxidation at all temperature levels. A direct relationship between viscosity increases and oxidation parameters was evident. Exposure to light caused a small increase in the oxidation parameters of esters stored at the highest temperature level. Addition of TBHQ prevented oxidation of samples stored under moderate conditions. Under unfavorable storage conditions the anti-oxidant was no longer effective. Mild steel had very little effect on the oxidation parameters. The anisidine values of samples stored at the highest temperature level were slightly increased. Methyl esters performed slightly better than ethyl esters during the storage test. The recommended guidelines for storage of fatty acid ester fuels are: (1) airtight containers should be used, (2) the storage temperature should be less than 30 C, (3) mild steel (rust free) containers may be used, and (4) TBHQ has a beneficial effect on oxidation stability. 13 references.","","","National Food Research Institute, Pretoria, South Africa","","","United States","1985-04-01T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: J.

Gasohol is a mixture of 10 vol % ethanol, derived from agricultural products, and 90 vol % unleaded gasoline. Experimental results from both a simulated 3-stage countercurrent extraction scheme and a bench-scale continuous extraction column show that gasohol can be produced by extracting ethanol from a 90 wt % ethanol aqueous solution. The extractions were conducted at temperatures from ambient up to 108/sup 0/F, and four different unleaded gasoline bases were successfully used as the solvents. These results were qualitatively predicted from theoretical calculations based on phase diagrams using two different types of gasolines as the extractive solvents. Various amounts of water will be extracted along with ethanol, depending upon the aromatics content in the gasoline. In a continuous extraction column, the gasohol extracted by highly aromatic gasoline (33 vol % aromatics) could contain up to 0.7 wt % water. Even a minor amount of water in gasohol will create a phase separation in colder climates. Both molecular sieve adsorption and chemical treatment can effectively remove the minor amount of water from the product gasohol. However, the economics of these treatments need to be investigated.","","","Phillips Research Center, Phillips Petroleum Company, Bartlesville, Oklahoma","","","United States","1985-04-01T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: Ind.

It is also the first example of a new technology that may seriously challenge traditional Fischer-Tropsch chemistry as a route to synthetic fuels and organic feedstocks. The MTG plant will produce 14,000 barrels per day of gasoline with an octane number rating of 92 to 94 (according to research results). This amount is about one third of present New Zealand demand. The gasoline will be made by catalytic conversion of methanol coming from two plants, each producing about 220 metric tons per day for the single-train MTG plant.

The low manganese oxide-containing catalysts showed greater specific activity for carbon monoxide and hexene hydrogenation than iron. The high manganese catalysts exhibited significantly increased hexene hydrogenation activity, possibly due to the presence of very small iron crystallites.

X-ray diffraction patterns were obtained following each step in a sequence of processes on each catalyst. The water media-impregnated catalyst displayed the larger particle size and all characteristics remained constant following the initial reduction. The carbonyl-impregnated catalyst showed the formation of a large amount of CoO after exposure to H/CO gas of 1/1 composition at 200/sup 0/C. Once the CoO formed it would continue to return after subsequent calcining and reduction treatments. 14 refs., 10 figs., 2 tabs.","","","Univ. of Kentucky, Lexington","","","United States","1985-03-01T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: J.

Two physisorbed species are present: one is localized on the free surface hydroxyls and the other is a liquid-like physisorbed chemisorbed species. Three CO chemisorbed species are detected, characterized by different chemisorption energies, as shown from the three different ranges of CO coverage in which they arise and reach their saturation. The comparison between CO adsorption on clean and D/sub 2/-pretreated samples shows that (1) the least energetic CO chemisorption occurs on the sites involved in the irreversible D/sub 2/ chemisorption, and (2) the other two CO species involve sites interacting with the reversible D/sub 2/ species.

The extent of potassium migration at 670 K was found to be dependent on the gas-phase composition during treatment. In particular, the mobility of potassium was greater in hydrogen than in oxygen, and the mobility in either gas was increased by the addition of H/sub 2/O. The kinetics of migration are consistent with a surface-stabilized potassium species. After initial vapor-phase transport of volatile, bulk potassium species, surface diffusion controls the migration. Potassium appears to be bonded with comparable strengths to iron and alumina surfaces. 23 refs., 3 figs., 1 tab.","","","Univ. of Wisconsin, Madison","","","United States","1985-03-01T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: J.

The basis for the applicability of this approximation is that the results of onedimensional calculations and experiment for the shock-wave parameters in conical convergent channels are in good agreement. The behaviour of the reacting medium behind the DW from is described by a system of gasdynamic equations in a quasi-one-dimensional approximation, taking account of the shift in chemical equilibrium of the PD, the loss due to friction, and heat transfer with the tube wall. Results of the calculations are shown.

The vinyl-oxo ligand has normal structure characteristics, and the C=C bond does not interact with the metal. Reaction of isocyanates (ArNCO) with complexes (I-III) led to the formation of an imido ligand bonding the metal in a bidentate fashion. Analogous results have been obtained by reacting complexes I-III with p-tolylcarbodiimide. Insertion of the CO/sub 2/-like molecule into the Zr-R bond occurs according to the following sequence: Me >Ph >> PhCH/sub 2/. Moreover, the occurrence of the reaction does strongly depend on the nature of the heterocumulene in the order Ph/sub 2/C=C=C > PhN=C=O > p-MeC/sub 6/H/sub 4/N-C-CNC/sub 6/H/sub 4/Me-p >> CO/sub 2/.

By using pressures up to 4 atm, we have been able to extend the concentration range of N2 and D2 in our investigations beyond that used in previous studies. The pN2 dependence of HD formation with constant pD2 ideally shows no HD formation under zero pN2, reaches a peak which depends on the pD2, and then decreases to zero at very high pN2. K. pneumoniae and C. pasteurianum nitrogenases differ in their Ki(D2) for nitrogen fixation. C. pasteurianum nitrogenase had the lower activity for formation of HD. With K. pneumoniae nitrogenase, D2 enhanced H2 evolution from 31% of the electron flux partitioned to H2 in the absence of D2 to 51% of the electron flux partitioned to H2 at 400 kPa of D2. With C. pasteurianum nitrogenase, the equivalent values were 33% and 48% of the total electron flux.

These catalysts were characterized by chemisorption of CO and H/sub 2/ at 195 and 300 K and their kinetic properties in the CO hydrogenation reaction were determined. If not exposed to air, only a low-temperature pretreatment at 473 K was required to reduce essentially all the Fe in the Fe/sub 3/(CO)/sub 12/ catalyst to activate it. In contrast, air exposure did not affect the reduction behavior of the Ru-containing catalysts. Both chemisorption and kinetic behavior indicated that surface enrichment in Fe occurred in these small crystallites after reduction, which is consistent with studies of bulk Fe-Ru systems. Turnover/frequencies (TOF) for CH/sub 4/ and total hydrocarbon formation increased in parellel with the increase in surface Ru concentration whereas the TOF for CO/sub 2/ smoothly decreased. Distinct differences in catalytic behavior were observed for a coimpregnated Fe/sub 3/(CO)/sub 12/ plus Ru/sub 3/(CO)/sub 12/ catalyst, compared to the mixed-metal cluster catalysts, indicating a lack of homogeneity when using this procedure. Scanning transmission electron microscope micrographs showed a raft-like structure for the metal crystallites in the small-pore structure of carbon, and this morphology may be partially responsible for the differences in catalytic behavior and the activity stability which exists between these carbon-supported metals and the same metals on other supports. 45 refs., 3 figs., 9 tabs.","","","Pennsylvannia State Univ., University Park","","","United States","1985-02-01T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: J.

Reactions were investigated at 250/sup 0/C and 1, 7.8, and 14 atm in a differential conversion range of less than 6%. Significant differences exist in the behavior of these supported catalysts in comparison to prior studies of fused or precipitated materials. It was found that an unpromoted Fe-carbide catalyst was more active at lower pressures and less active at higher pressures than the nitrided catalyst. Moreover, it was found that potassium-promoted catalysts were less active than catalysts without potassium. Both Fe-nitride and potassium-promoted catalysts showed higher olefin selectivities, higher water-gas shift activity, lower alcohol yields, and larger proportions of higher molecular weight products than their unpromoted counterparts. The product distributed parameters are presented for all catalysts at different pressures and conversion levels. The significance of the incorporation of alcohols into the distribution plot is discussed and a mechanism for alcohol formation is proposed. The effect of nitrogen on the catalytic reaction is discussed in terms of a donor model theory in which nitrogen atoms donate electrons to the iron d band. From the product distribution of the supported Fe-nitride and potassium-promoted catalysts, it is concluded that nitrogen and potassium have similar promoting function on the Fischer-Tropsch reactions and further that an additive effect is observed for Fe-K-nitride catalysts. 31 refs.","","","Northwestern Univ., Evanston, IL","","","United States","1985-02-01T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: J.

This effect is attributed to an increase in electron deficiency of the metal crystallites owing to an electron transfer from the metal to electron-acceptor sites in the support. Hydrogen then competes more successfully with carbon monoxide for available surface sites, resulting in an increased hydrogenation activity. This conclusion is supported by the marked decrease in the selectivity to olefins which is observed. The electronic influence of the support is greater for small metal particles. 28 refs., 4 figs., 5 tabs.","","","Council for Scientific and Industrial Research, Pretoria, South Africa","","","United States","1985-02-01T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: J.

One of the reasons for the study of methanol economics is that methanol is currently considered by several government and industry groups as the optimal alternate fuel to replace gasoline. This is a recent development, because methanol is a basic industrial chemical that has never previously been available for motor fuel in significant quantities. Methanol became available for the fuels market because of an anticipated increase in industrial demand that did not materialize. This over-supply has resulted in depressed methanol prices, and methanol suppliers have been searching for ways to soak up the excess capacity. So far the only use large enough to do this has been the motor fuels market.

Significant differences in initial activity were observed, depending on whether the MgO was pretreated under vacuum or a flow of oxygen. Vacuum conditioning led to essentially no activity while oxygen conditioning resulted in substantial radical production. The oxidant of choice was also critical. Nitrous oxide resulted in a continuous decline of activity while in the presence of oxygen the formation of radicals was at a steady state. Doping of MgO with lithium, sodium, or iron was also examined. Lithium was found to greatly increase the activity up to a doping level of approximately 15.0 wt%. Two pathways are believed to be responsible for the radical formation. Over pure MgO, intrinsic cattion vacancies react with molecular oxygen to given an O/sup -/ center which can abstract a hydrogen atom from methane to produce the methyl radical. For the lithium-doped samples, substitutional Li/sup +/ ions react with molecular oxygen to form a (Li/sup +/O/sup -/) center which is also capable of abstracting a hydrogen atom from methane. 28 references, 5 figures, 3 tables.","","","Texas A and M Univ., College Station","","","United States","1985-01-09T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: J.

The ..cap alpha..-Fe particles in reduced Fe/C-1 exhibit behavior characteristic of very small (2 nm) particles. First, substantial contributions of superparamagnetic ..cap alpha..-Fe occur in the Moessbauer spectra at 295 and 77 K. Second, the magnetic hyperfine fields of the ..cap alpha..-Fe in the spectra at 4 K are enhanced by about 7 kOe, due to the influence of the demagnetizing field in the particle. Third, the effective Debye temperatures of the Fe/C-1 catalysts are much smaller than in iron bulk compounds. Exposure of reduced Fe/C-1 to air results in the oxidation of all iron to Fe/sup 3 +/.

The promising solvents are glycerin, ethylene glycol, tetraethylene glycol, and triethylene glycol. An improved extractive distillation process for producing anhydrous ethanol was conceptually developed which was based on the analysis of the experimental solvent screening data. The basic idea of this process is to add an extractive solvent only to the ethanol-rich portion of the fractionator to eliminate the ethanol-water azeotrope and to change the undesirable shape of the vapor-liquid equilibrium curve to one more favorable for distillation. With a suitable solvent, such as ethylene glycol, anhydrous ethanol could be produced from the fermentation broth in a column with only 18 theoretical trays. A low reflux ratio of 1.5 and a low solvent-to-feed ratio of 0.27 (based on fermentation broth) would be needed for the separation.","","","Phillips Research Center, Phillips Petroleum Company, Bartlesville, Oklahoma","","","United States","1985-01-01T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: Ind.

The temporal variations of the quantitative yields of 33 different products, including 12 gases, water, methanol, and 19 phenolics allowed resolution of primary and secondary pathways, description of the influence of reactor design and lignin type on product yields, and formulation of a simple kinetic lumping scheme. Products within separate guaiacol and catechol lumps attained maximal proportions at 7.5 and 15 min, respectively, during kraft lignin pyrolysis at 400/sup 0/C. Within a lump, the secondary reactions of individual species were nearly synchronous. Further, the similarity of the observed rate of the secondary decomposition of guaiacols during kraft lignin pyrolysis with that previously reported for pyrolysis of pure guaiacol suggest that the reactions of lignin's thermally liberated single-ring products are insensitive to the presence of other molecular species or poymer residuum. All of the foregoing indicates that a simple reaction network based on phenol, guaiacol, and catechol lumps could be a useful model of phenolics product evolution.","","","Department of Chemical Engineering, University of Delaware, Newark, Delaware","","","United States","1985-01-01T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: Ind.

The mean number (n) of steps taken by a diffusion coreactant before an irreversible reaction takes place at one of the catalytically active sites defining a multiplet has been calculated. This number (n) is related to the lifetime of the species and thence to the turnover number determined experimentally. Calculations are based on a lattice theory of diffusion-controlled processes proposed recently by the authors in which the theory of finite Markov processes is coupled with group theoretical arguments to yield a method for calculating exactly the mean, variance, skewness, and kurtosis of the underlying probability distribution function defining the process. Once the numerical results for (n) for different multiplet configurations have been presented, trends in the data are identified, and it is indicated how these can be understood in terms of the interplay of two factors: (1) the number and cluster configuration of the reaction centers and (2) a (discretized) correlation length k which specifies the distribution of singlets/ multiplets relative to a conveniently chosen reference point of the reaction space. In order to provide a concrete illustration of the manner in which these results may be used to interpret experiments, the presentation here focused on the work of Sinfelt and co-workers on the catalytic properties of bimetallic systems (and, in particular, on their studies of the hydrogenolysis of ethane and dehydrogenation of cyclohexane on Ni/Cu alloys.)","","","Univ. of Notre Dame, IN","","","United States","1985-01-01T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: Langmuir; (United States); Journal Volume: 1:4","","Medium: X; Size: Pages: 429-443","","","","Journal ID: CODEN: LANGD","10.1021/la00064a007","","2016-04-20T00:00:00Z","6195110","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/6195110","","Langmuir; (United States)","","1:4"

In the presence of oxygen adatoms the surface concentration of chemisorbed methanol increased, as indicated by the enhancement of the losses at 13.7-13.9 and 12.1-11 eV, and by the increased amount of decomposition products of chemisorbed species at higher temperature. It is proposed that the role of adsorbed oxygen is to promote the dissociative adsorption of CH/sub 3/OH by forming a strong O-H bond which hinders the associative desorption of CH/sub 3/OH. As a result, the surface concentration of irreversibly bonded methoxy species is increased. At the optimum oxygen coverage, Theta/sub O/ approx. = 0.15-0.2, the number of methoxy species was twice that on clean Rh(111). Chemisorbed oxygen exerted a slight stabilizing effect on the methoxy species, which was stable up to about 200 K, but then decomposed and reacted with chemisorbed oxygen to yield H/sub 2/, CO, H/sub 2/O, and CO/sub 2/.","","","Univ. of Szeged, Hungary","","","United States","1984-12-06T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: J.

The spent catalyst also must be passivated prior to offloading, in order to avoid combustion upon contact with air. In all of these cases, the need for passivation of reduced ammonia synthesis catalysts is connected with the pyrophoric character of the iron. It has been established that the pyrophoric character is eliminated after an oxide layer of a specific thickness has been applied to the surface of the iron - i.e., after passivation. To resolve the problems of recovering spent catalyst with controllable depth of oxidation, tests were carried out on low-temperature oxidation of catalysts in the 50-200/sup 0/C temperature interval. This article presents the results of a study of the oxidation of iron on a sample of reduced magnetite and on samples of various industrial ammonia synthesis catalysts (types SA-1, SA-1V and SAMV-5) at 50, 100, 150 and 200/sup 0/C with oxygen from mixtures of oxygen and helium (oxygen concentrations 0.1, 1.0 and 3.0 vol%) under dynamic conditions. 9 references, 3 figures, 4 tables.","","","","","","United States","1984-11-01T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: Sov.

Isobutyl alcohol is the predominant higher alcohol formed. Significant amounts of ethanol, propanol, butanol, 2-methylbutanol, and 2-methylpentanol are also produced. In addition to higher alcohols, a significant portion of the methanol is converted to CH/sub 4/, CO, and H/sub 2/. The overall product distribution is a function of the metal acetylide employed and the reaction conditions. /sup 13/C labeling studies have conclusively shown that the source of the carbon in the higher alcohols is the methanol, not the metal acetylide. However, studies indicate that the process is not catalytic, presumably due to the fact that under reaction conditions, the metal acetylide is converted to other species which are not catalytically active. Attempts to determine the fate of the acetylide and the catalytic activity of the resultant species are described.

These pathways are attributed to two forms of adsorbed CO. The CO site which reacts at low temperature (446 K) may be attributed to carbon monoxide adsorbed on nickel atoms that are bonded to other nickel atoms. Activation energy for methanation is 51 kJ/mol. The CO site that reacts at high temperature (546 K) pretreatment temperature, results from CO adsorbed on nickel atoms that are interacting strongly with an oxide phase of the catalyst. Interconversion of CO between the two sites occurs and is influenced by hydrogen. Neither of the pathways appears limited by direct hydrogenation of surface carbon; this step is shown to be slightly faster under TPR conditions. The ability of TPR to measure specific reaction rates and to separate reaction pathways that might be obscured in steady-state kinetic measurements is demonstrated. 30 references, 3 figures, 8 tables.","","","Univ. of Colorado, Boulder","","","United States","1984-10-01T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: J.

The injection and atomization characteristics of the vegetable oils are significantly different than those of petroleum-derived diesel fuels, mainly as a result of their high viscosities. Heating the oils, however, results in spray characteristics more like those observed with diesel fuel. The 2 engine types demonstrated different sensitivities to the composition of the various oils. The combustion characteristics and the durability of the direct-injection engine were affected by the oil composition. The indirect-injection engine, however, was not greatly affected by composition. Two different preliminary specifications have been proposed: a stringent specification including compositional requirements for direct-injection engines, and a less stringent specification for indirect-injection engines. The specifications are discussed in terms of the data and the rationale used in their development.

The major problem experienced while operating with the microemulsion was an incomplete combustion process at low-load engine operation. Significant lubricating oil dilution was observed initially, followed by an abnormal increase in the viscosity of the lubricative oil.

This test requires only half the test time of an ASTM Sequence V-D test used by many researchers, and yet provides sufficient severity to generate measurable bore wear to discriminate engine hardware changes. A portable fixture was designed to provide rapid, convenient, and accurate measurement of radial bore wear at a prescribed depth in the cylinder. The fixture can measure radial bore wear with accuracies to 0.004 mm. Its portability allows on-site measurement of engines on dynamometer test stands, or in vehicles with minimal engine disassembly. The test procedure and measurement fixture were used to quantitatively document the ring and bore wear effects of numerous variables, such as fuels, fully formulated lubricants, top ring configurations, coolant temperatures and flow patterns, intake heat addition, and fuel contamination.","","","Ford Motor Co.","","","United States","1984-10-01T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: SAE Prepr.; (United States); Journal Volume: SAE 841377","","Medium: X; Size: Pages: 11","","","","Journal ID: CODEN: SEPPA","10.4271/841377","","2016-05-09T00:00:00Z","5057605","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/5057605","","SAE Prepr.; (United States)","","SAE 841377"

When hydrocarbon product distributions were compared at constant CO conversion or at constant CH/sub 4/ formation turnover frequencies, rather than at constant temperature, differences in selectivity were small for the series of catalysts studied. The temperature-programmed desorption of CO from these catalysts showed the presence of three desorption maxima, centered at 100, 220, and 450/sup 0/C, respectively. The relative intensity of the maximum centered at 220/sup 0/C was observed to increase slightly on the catalysts modified by the addition of alkali metals. However, this slight increase in binding energy did not appear to promote the formation of surface carbon. The high-temperature maximum centered at 450/sup 0/C was assigned to Co formed by the reaction between surface carbon and H/sub 2/O from the support. An in situ infrared study of the CO surface species present on the catalyst surface during reaction showed only one band centered at 2030 cm/sup -1/ on supported Ru. This was in contrast to the two bands centered at 2020 and 1950 cm/sup -1/, which were observed for the K- and Cs-promoted catalysts. The results of this study suggest a depression in the rate of hydrogenation of the surface carbon species as a result of the addition of the alkali metal modifier. This is explained by invoking site blocking by the alkali metal adatoms rather than by an electronic effect. 31 references, 3 figures, 7 tables.","","","Univ. of Rhode Island, Kingston","","","United States","1984-10-01T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: J.

For each of the Pd/SiO/sub 2/ catalysts, the ratio of adsorbed H atoms, or adsorbed CO, to surface Pd atoms is unity. The stoichiometry for atomic adsorption stoichiometry for CO decreases linearly from 0.6 to 0 as the Pd dispersion decreased from 30 to 8%. The suppression of CO adsorption is attributed to patches of partially reduced support material, LaO/sub x/, transferred to the surface of the Pd crystallites during catalyst preparation. The fraction of the Pd crystallite surface covered by LaO/sub x/ increases with Pd dispersion, in agreement with conclusions based on earlier x-ray photoelectron spectroscopy studies. Ir studies indicate that the structures of CO adsorbed on Pd/La/sub 2/O/sub 3/ and Pd/SiO/sub 2/ are similar, but that the strength of adsorption is weaker for Pd/La/sub 2/O/sub 3/ than for Pd/SiO/sub 2/. This is attributed to a weakening in the sigma-bond component of the Pd-CO bond due to charge transfer from the LaO/sub x/ patches to the Pd crystallites. The absence of any suppression of H/sub 2/ adsorption of Pd/La/sub 2/O/sub 3/ indicates that H/sub 2/ adsorption occurs both on the exposed Pd surface atoms as well as on the LaO/sub x/ patches covering the balance of the surface Pd atoms. 53 references, 11 figures, 2 tables.","","","Univ. of California, Berkeley","","","United States","1984-10-01T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: J.

These suggest that the mechanism of the reaction employing the Fe(CO)/sub 3/(C/sub 2/H/sub 4/) is different from that employing just Fe(CO)/sub x/. In an attempt to explain the reaction mechanism, four processes considered to occur with the advent of each laser pulse were: 1) photo-ejection of CO from precatalyst with unit quantum efficiency to create active catalyst; 2) adsorption of light by catalyst remaining from previous pulses; 3) catalyst recombination with CO; and 4) catalyst-promoted hydrogenation of ethylene. From consideration of these processes, a mathematical model is developed that suggests that the recombination in the case of a substituted carbonyl, Fe(CO)/sub 3/(C/sub 2/H/sub 4/), is slowed by an activation barrier, possibly associated with a required rearrangement of the ethylene ligand.","","","Univ. of Waterloo, Ontario","","","United States","1984-08-08T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: J.

The radicals were produced by the rapid Cl + C/sub 2/H/sub 6/ reaction following the pulsed production of chlorine atoms from the infrared multiple-photon-induced decomposition of CFCl/sub 3/. Reactant and product concentrations were monitored in real-time experiments using photoionization mass spectrometry. Overall rate constants of the C/sub 2/H/sub 5/ + O/sub 2/ reaction were measured near seven temperatures between 294 and 1002 K. In addition, C/sub 2/H/sub 4/ product yields were determined at three different temperatures. Special emphasis was given to obtaining the density dependence of the overall rate constant at four temperatures. The pressure and temperature dependencies of the measured rate constants, the C/sub 2/H/sub 4/ product yields, and the results of prior studies of this reaction are discussed in terms of two mechanisms: one which proceeds by parallel uncoupled routes to C/sub 2/H/sub 5/O/sub 2/ and C/sub 2/H/sub 4/ formation and another which proceeds by coupled routes via a common C/sub 2/H/sub 5/O/sub 2/* intermediate.

Evaluations of ethanol as either a direct substitute for petroleum fuels or as an extender are underway. Although changes in gasoline prices or financial incentives could make a difference, they would continue to give large-scale producers a competitive advantage. Studies to evalute the use of oilseeds conclude that the economics do not favor private-sector development because the advantages to producers would not outweigh the negative impacts on other parts of the agricultural industry.","","","","","","United States","1984-08-01T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: Tex.

Facile methylation of olefins with methanol to produce the next higher olefinic homolog was observed. Ethylene was the major primary hydrocarbon produced from methanol at low conversion. The olefin mixtures isolated under various conditions of reaction were fitted to the chain-growth kinetics as described by the Flory equation. Good to excellent correlation coefficients were found at low and medium conversions of methanol. This is consistent with a stepwise growth in molecular weight of the olefins, starting with propylene, by alkylation of the olefins with methanol. However, since ethylene is produced by a different mechanism, it does not fit the Flory equation. At higher temperatures and conversions, the olefins undergo scrambling or thermodynamic equilibration reactions also producing olefin mixtures with good correlation coefficients. Under the latter conditions, a distinction between the stepwise growth and thermodynamic equilibration reactions cannot be made since both contribute to the product mixture.","","","Mobil Chemical Co., Edison, NJ","","","United States","1984-08-01T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: J.

The model is also used to describe the system in the presence of various other catalysts, Fe, Co, Ni, Pd, Ru, Rh, and Pt.","","","Univ. of Lund, Sweden","","","United States","1984-08-01T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: J.

The alcohols studied were 2-butanol and 2-octanol; but since a serious secondary isomerization effect present when 2-butanol is converted is eliminated when a mixture of the two alcohols is converted, the mixture was used for this study. The results indicated that two types of dehydration sites must occur on the alumina catalyst. One type designated A is more active for dehydration, and their selectivity from 1-butene and cis-2-butene in about equal amounts with only a small fraction of trans-2-butene. The other type of sites, B sites, form isomers in nearly equal amounts.","","","Univ. of Louisville, KY","","","United States","1984-08-01T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: J.

The methanol industry will continue pursuing the immense automotive fuel market with a combination of neat and blended methanol and octane enhancer products. The ultimate goal is a neat methanol fuel system, but that will involve large supply and delivery investments, and possibly government participation. The economics of methanol (at 42 cents a gallon) and gasoline blends is good, but auto makers are concerned about moisture and other technical problems, and EPA approval is needed to waive Clean Air Act regulations.

It was found that H and O atoms have their maximum concentrations in the inner flame region within 1 mm from the burner mouth, while the OH concentration slowly increases in the outer flame region to reach a maximum at about 8 mm from the burner mouth. The slow increase in OH concentration is attributed to the reaction H + O/sub 2/ ..-->.. OH + O effectuated by diffusion of O/sub 2/ from the surrounding air into the flame. Addition of H/sub 2/O reduced the O atom concentration and increased the OH radical concentration in the inner flame region. The reaction O + H/sub 2/O ..-->.. 2OH is suggested as an explanation. Addition of HBr gave additional signals from Br and was found to reduce the H, O, and OH concentrations in the flame. It also caused the flame to shrink probably as a result of H atom deficiency in the inner flame region leading to insufficient generation of O and OH in the outer flame region.

In pulse-flow experiments, the reactants were introduced both on a fresh alumina surface and on a surface covered by reaction components during steady-state operation. The results indicate that surface ethoxide is the reaction intermediate in all transformations. From the alcohol, it is formed by the substitution of the surface hydroxyl groups under liberation of water and then decomposes relatively slowly into ethylene; also 2-butanol and 2-methyl-2-propanol behaved in this way. A general scheme for reversible surface reactions of alcohols, ethers, and water with surface hydroxyl and alkoxide groups is proposed. The possibility of the participation of alkoxides in the steady-state dehydration of alcohols is discussed. The distinction between fresh and working surfaces of alumina is stressed.","","","Inst. of Chemical Process Fundamentals, Suchdol, Czechoslovakia","","","United States","1984-06-01T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: J.

On the most active metals which dissociate CO and produce a broad distribution of hydrocarbons under reaction conditions, the synthesis seems to proceed at the highest rate on large ensembles of surface atoms, pointing to structure sensitivity. However, for the less-active group 8 metals, which do not dissociate CO readily and do not produce substantial amounts of hydrocarbons heavier than methane under reaction conditions, no clear trends can be discerned. Hydrocarbon synthesis on these catalysts can be structure sensitive under some conditions, but the effects of structure are quite different from those observed for the most active catalysts. This review suggests that both the nature of the catalyst surface and the mechanism of methane synthesis vary substantially among group 8 metals, so that no general conclusion can be made about the structure sensitivity of methane synthesis.","","","Stanford Univ., CA","","","United States","1984-05-24T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: J.

At 300 K chemisorption occurs rapidly (sticking probability approx. = 0.4) with partial decomposition of the adsorbate; the overall decomposition which takes place upon subsequent heating exhibits two distinct stages. At 600 K decomposition (evolving only H/sub 2/) and desorption of NH/sub 3/ become competing processes. Preadsorbed N inhibits the decomposition very efficiently, but preadsorbed H has no such effect; D/sub 2/ and NH/sub 3/ do not appear to compete for a common adsorption site. Rapid equilibration between H (from NH/sub 3/) and coadsorbed D occurs in this regime, although exchange into the N-H bond itself is slow. The stoichiometry of this intermediate surface phase and the mechanism of its subsequent decomposition are investigated. Simultaneous evolution of N/sub 2/ and a small amount of H/sub 2/ occurs above 750 K. The principal pathway for this stage is shown to involve a small amount of NH/sub x/ species in the presence of an otherwise completely dehydrogenated layer. In contradistinction with earlier work, no evidence was found for the presence of stable uniform intermediate phases such as NH or NH/sub 2/; these apparent discrepancies are acounted for. Auger spectroscopy reveals the onset of W nitridation under reaction conditions, and experiments with N/sub 2/H/sub 4/ confirm certain aspects of the mechanism proposed here for NH/sub 3/ decomposition. 23 references, 8 figures.","","","Univ. of Cambridge, England","","","United States","1984-05-10T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: J.

The studies were made mostly at 270-285/sup 0/C and the catalyst was exposed to CO/H/sub 2/ and CO/He gas mixtures. The decarburization by H/sub 2/ was also studied. The principal carbides found are x-carbide, Fe/sub 2.5/C, epsilon'-carbide, Fe/sub 2.2/C with a tendency for a preponderance of the latter at long reaction times. The carburization by CO is promoted by the presence of H/sub 2/, even in a small concentration. The promoting action of H/sub 2/ seems to be related to the ease of carburizing a particle with a well-reduced surface. Adding water to CO/H/sub 2/ slows the carburization rate without slowing the carbon deposition rate. Similar experiments with 10% Fe/SiO/sub 2/ (Cab-O-Sil) catalyst give similar results.

Continuous observation of the process up to 1150/sup 0/C shows that the mode of catalytic action is dependent upon the temperature. In the initial stages, particles located at edges and steps on the surface wet and spread along these sites, which then undergo rapid recession. As a consequence, most of the material is utilized during the reaction, making BaO not only a very active additive, but also a very efficient one. As the temperature is raised, there is an increasing tendency for particles to reform at edges, and the catalytic mode changes to channeling. Treatment of the barium/graphite system in carbon dioxide shows parallel behavior to that observed in steam. The oxide is also an active catalyst for the graphite-oxygen reaction, but in this case its activity is similar to that of many other additives. In another series of experiments, barium nitrite/graphite specimens were treated in hydrogen. When barium was activated, it was found to be an effective hydrogenation catalyst for graphite. To achieve this condition, it is necessary to heat the system to 900/sup 0/C, and then the catalytic channels which are produced will continue to progress even as the temperature is decreased to 700/sup 0/C. In contrast to the oxidation reactions, the additive did not exhibit any wetting and spreading effects in the hydrogen environment.","","","Exxon Research and Engineering Co., Annandale, NJ","","","United States","1984-05-01T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: J.

Under the same reaction conditions higher surface area iron powders promote the formation of carbidic rather than graphitic carbon. The carbided surfaces were more stable under reaction conditions but were also susceptible to poisoning by graphite deposition at temperature above 550 K.

The reaction takes place on a partially ordered carbon covered surface, where the carbonaceous deposits have a morphology similar to that of ethylidyne.

It is found that the Pd/SiO/sub 2/ catalysts, and the Pd/TiO/sub 2/ catalyst reduced at low temperatures, exhibit normal chemisorption and catalytic properties. Pd/TiO/sub 2/ catalysts reduced at high temperatures have much lower capacity to adsorb H/sub 2/ or CO and much lower specific activities for the hydrogenolysis of ethane, which is consistent with the presence of a strong metal-support interaction (SMSI). For the CO/H/sub 2/ reaction it is found that all the Pd/TiO/sub 2/ catalysts have enhanced activity for the CO/H/sub 2/ reaction, irrespective of whether or not strong metal-support interactions are operative. It is concluded that the high activity of titania-supported catalysts in the CO/H/sub 2/ reaction is not due to SMSI. Instead it is proposed that the role of the support is to create new active sites at the interface between the metal and the support. These new sites have the capacity to adsorb, or assist in the adsorption of, CO. It is suggested that a similar model may account for the observed effects of other, irreducible, supports, where enhanced activity may also be obtained.","","","Univ. of Reading, England","","","United States","1984-04-01T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: J.

The use of these chemical probes identified different manifestation of SMSI that depend on crystallite size and reduction treatment. On the basis of these manifestations, a hierarchy consisting of five stages was developed to rank the extent of interaction in Ni/Nb/sub 2/O/sub 5/ catalysts. A mechanism of SMSI was proposed for a physical explanation of this hierarchy.","","","Carnegie-Mellon Univ., Pittsburgh, PA","","","United States","1984-04-01T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: J.

However, a recently synthesized iridium (Ir) complex successfully converts alkanes into hydridoalkylmetal complexes. This is a dihydride having the formula Cp/sup */(L)IrH/sub 2/, where Cp/sup */ = (CH/sub 3/)/sub 5/C/sub 5/ and L = (CH/sub 3/)/sub 3/P/sub 3/, respectively. Irradiation with ultraviolet light causes the dihydride to lose H/sub 2/, generating the reactive intermediate Cp/sup */IrL, which reacts rapidly with C-H bonds in every molecule so far tested (including alkanes) and leads to hydridoalkyliridium complexes Cp/sup */(L)Ir(R)(H). Evidence has been obtained that this C-H insertion, or oxidative addition, reaction proceeds through a simple three-center transition state and does not involve organic free radicals as intermediates. Thus the intermediate Cp/sup */IrL reacts most rapidly with C-H bonds having relatively high bond energies, such as those at primary carbon centers, in small organic rings, and in aromatic rings. The hydridoalkyliridium products of the insertion reactions can be converted into functionalized organic molecules - alkyl halides - by treatment with mercuric chloride followed by halogens. Expulsion (reductive elimination) of the hydrocarbon from the hydridoalkyliridium complexes can be induced by Lewis acids or heat, regenerating the reactive intermediate Cp/sup */IrL. Oxidative addition of the corresponding rhodium complexes Cp/sup */RhL to alkane C-H bonds has also been observed, although the products formed in this case are much less stable and undergo reductive elimination at -20/sup 0/C.","","","Univ. of California, Berkeley","","","United States","1984-03-02T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: Science (Washington, D.C.); (United States); Journal Volume: 223","","Medium: X; Size: Pages: 902-908","","","","Journal ID: CODEN: SCIEA","10.1126/science.223.4639.902","","2016-05-13T00:00:00Z","5939815","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/5939815","","Science (Washington, D.C.); (United States)","","223"

The decrease in catalytic activity was fast in an oxygen-rich reactant gas mixture. At a CO/O/sub 2/ ratio greater than that required for stoichiometry, partial deactivation was slow, continuing for several hours. When the rate of the oxidation reaction was decreased following 100% conversion in the diffusion-controlled kinetic regime, a significant decrease in the reaction rate was observed. This reaction rate hysteresis was considerably larger when the catalyst was exposed to an oxygen-rich reactant gas mixture. During catalyst deactivation, the absorbance of the IR doublet centered at 2130 and 2060 cm/sup -1/ was observed to increase. This IR doublet, asssigned to CO absorbed on an oxidized Ru surface species, increased very rapidly when the reactant gas mixture was either net oxidizing or close to stoichiometry. The results of a temperature-programmed desorption (TPD) and a temperature-programmed oxidation study suggest that partial deactivation occurs as the result of the formation of a more tightly bound oxygen species, perhaps lattice oxygen which reacts more slowly with adsorbed CO than oxygen in the reactant gas mixture. Multiple steady-state oscillations were observed following the attainment of steady-state reaction rates. The results of a temperature-programmed reduction study show that the CO species responsible for the CO absorption band at 2010 cm/sup -1/ reacts preferentially with H/sub 2/ to form CH/sub 4/.","","","Univ. of Rhode Island, Kingston","","","United States","1984-03-01T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: J.

The index of consumption of the original carbon-hydrogen raw material in obtaining the total hydrogen and carbon monoxide is used for a cost comparison of the commercial production from coal, oil, and gas. The high consumption of raw material in the chemical processing of coal results from the comparatively low content of carbon.

In the concentration range studied, a plot of the free energy of solution of naphthalene vs. mole fraction of ethanol present in the solvent is linear. The heat of solution of naphthalene in water is positive and becomes more positive as the ethanol concentration is increased. This heat term is more than overcome by a concomitant large increase in the entropy of solution, the net effect being to solubilize the hydrocarbon by the addition of ethanol. The addition of ethanol to the aqueous phase is much more effective in solubilizing naphthalene at high rather than low temperatures. The results may be interpreted in terms of the McMillian-Mayer second virial coefficient. It is suggested that ethanol may exert its influence upon hydrocarbon solubility by loss of water structure as hydrophobic interactions take place between the hydrocarbon and alcohol. Dispersal of an iceberg or clathrate structure probably makes a significant contribution.","","","West Virginia Univ.

The decomposition products on the (1010) and (5051) surfaces were similar, but the coverage and the amounts of products were consistently higher on the (5051) surface. Two pathways for decomposition of methanol are proposed, dissociatively adsorbed oxygen at 150/sup 0/C and oxidation of methoxide to a surface formate-like species. Formaldehyde and formic acid also decomposed via the surface formate. The competition between dehydrogenation and oxidation depended on the coverage such that dehydrogenation was more favored for higher coverages. Decomposition products were identified for the two pathways for the different compounds. Desorption of all the decomposition products wasreaction-limited except for water which was desorption-limited. The results indicated that the (0001) surface is more metallic in its behavior than the (1010) and (5051) surfaces. Comparison of the desorption temperatures of different compounds suggests that at room temperature, alcohols adsorb molecularly on the (0001) surface but dissociatively on the other two surfaces.

Although it is fair to consider them as short-term emergency fuels (or more desirably low proportion supplements to diesel fuels) they present mechanical problems in long-term use that have not yet been solved. It is preferable to use these oils blended in small proportions with diesel fuels. Indirect-injection diesel engines have had fewer problems than direct-injection engines, whether the tests were performed with pure vegetable oil fuel or with vegetable oil/diesel fuel blends. The economic prospect for these fuels is not promising. In general, they are not and have not been economical alternatives to diesel fuel. Exceptions appear to have occurred recently in Brazil and the Philippines where low local prices for vegetable oils combined with high petroleum prices encouraged officials to use low proportion vegetable oil/diesel fuel blends. Nonetheless, current and long-term trends in petroleum and oilseed prices indicate that these fuels will probably not be price competitive within the near future. Emergency disruption of petroleum supplies completely changes the economic situation. Vegetable oils would be worth much more as a fuel during disruptions than otherwise; thus incentives could be strong to include these oils in the fuel supply, diverting them from the food supply. 20 references.","","","Research Triangle Inst., Research Triangle Park, NC","","","United States","1984-02-01T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: J.

The ..cap alpha..-addition is a slow step with a large activation energy (140 kJ/mol) while ..beta..-addition is faster and has a smaller activation energy (66 kJ/mol).

The type of zeolite had pronounced effects on the activity and selectivity of the Ru. The specific activity would appear to be related to the dispersion of reduced ruthenium in the zeolite. Methane selectivity, however, seems to be strongly influenced by the type and concentration of alkali cations remaining in the ion-exchanged zeolite. These cations appear to promote chain growth much as traditional alkali promoters would, though perhaps more indirectly. Due to bifunctional properties of the zeolite-supported catalysts, a significant fraction of C/sub 4/ was in the form of isobutane. Formation of isobutane seems to be related to either the Si/Al ratio in the zeolites or the concentration of the remaining alkali cations, but not to the OH concentration. In addition, H/sub 2/ chemisorption at 25/sup 0/C was increasingly suppressed as the Se/Al ratio of the zeolite support increased. Both the formation of isobutane and the suppression of H/sub 2/ chemisorption may be related to the acid strength of the OH groups present, which is a function of the Si/Al ratio of the zeolite.","","","Univ. of Pittsburgh, PA","","","United States","1984-02-01T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: J.

Thermolysis of the diazenes at 50-80/sup 0/C in alkenes leads to alcohols. For example, 2b decomposes in 1,1-diphenylethene to afford 5-hydroxy-5,5-yield. Thermolysis of a diazene 2 in an enol ether solvent leads to an aldehyde or a ketone. Thus, 2a decomposes in 1-ethoxyethene and in 2-methoxypropene to afford, respective, 4,4,4-trifluorobutanol and 5,5,5-trifluoro-intermediates and radical chain hydroxyalkylation of alkene double bonds. In one chain-propagating step, R., generated from 2, adds to the alkene. The adduct radical so formed propagates by inducing decomposition of 2 by attack at hydroxyl oxygen. According to this mechanism, inital products from enol ethers are hemiacetals or hemiketals which do not survive the reaction conditions but decompose to the corresponding carbonyl compounds. Preliminary evidence for this mechanism is presented.","","","","","","United States","1984-01-27T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: J. Org.

The reaction is general, resulting in the oxidation of primary and secondary alcohols, with the principal products being aldehydes and ketones. The catalytic autoxidation is affected by the strength of the base used and its coordinating ability. The best results were obtained with sodium ethoxide as a base. Turnover numbers of 10-30 per day were observed in 1 atm of oxygen at ambient temperature, with larger turnover numbers at higher temperature. More than 200 turnovers were observed in the oxidation of ethanol at the ambient temperature with little or no loss of catalytic activity. The catalyzed electrochemical oxidation was carried out in an alcoholic solution containing 2,6-lutidine with a carbon electrode at 0.8-1.0 V vs. NHE. In the absence of catalyst, negligible current was observed. More than 20 catalytic cycles were completed with the current remaining at 75% of its initial value. The ruthenium III complex exhibits reversible one-electron oxidation waves in non-alcoholic solvents in the presence or absence of 2,6-lutidine. Possible pathways for the catalytic autoxidation and electrochemical oxidation are presented.","","","California Inst. of Tech., Pasadena","","","United States","1984-01-04T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: Inorg.

This effect has been studied by means of kinetic experiments and thermogravimetry. The kinetic data can be explained by simple blockage of the surface as reflected in the observed kinetic orders and activation energy. The studies of carbon formation confirm a threshold coverage of about 70% of full coverage below which the inhibition of carbon is not effective. Above this coverage, amorphous carbon structures may be formed at a very high carbon potentials. The retarding effect of sulfur on carbon formation is a dynamic phenomenon. Sulfur inhibits the rate of carbon formation more than the rate of the reforming reactions. The effects are explained by assuming that a large ensemble is involved in the nucleation of carbon, whereas the reforming reaction can proceed on the small ensembles left a high sulfur coverages. 6 figures, 6 tables.","","","Haldor Topsoe A/S, Lyngby, Denmark","","","United States","1984-01-01T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: J.

It was found that hydrogen reduction at 500/sup 0/C before or after Ni deposition on TiO/sub 2/(100) always results in an enhanced steady-state methanation activity, accompanied by a lower surface carbon level.

The bed is modeled either as a single CSTR or as multiple CSTR's connected in series. The number of CSTR's required is governed by the product of Schmidt and Reynold's number, ScRe. The model developed in this paper is used to calculate TPD spectra for the desorption of CO and H/sub 2/ from the surface of a Group VIII metal. It is established that the position and shape of the spectra are sensitive functions of catalyst particle size, catalyst bed depth, carrier flow rate, and carrier gas composition. The effects of nonuniformities in the initial distribution of adsorbate are also examined. For small particle diameters, such nonuniformities are rapidly annealed by intraparticle diffusion, and as a consequence have little effect on the shape or position of the TPD spectrum. For larger particle diameters, distortions of the spectrum due to nonuniform adsorbate distribution are expected. The theoretically generated TPD spectra are used to evaluate the applicability of a relationship developed for describing equilibrium desorption in the absence of mass transfer effects. Reasonably accurate estimates of the enthalpy of adsorption can be obtained from this relationship, but its use to determine the preexponential factor for desorption produces large errors when significant mass transfer effects are present. 12 figures, 4 tables.","","","Univ. of California, Berkeley","","","United States","1984-01-01T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: J.

The results indicate that specific activity and selectivity of cobalt vary with support, dispersion, metal loading, and preparation method. The order of decreasing CO hydrogenation activity at 1 atm and 225/sup 0/C for catalysts containing 3 wt% cobalt is Co/TiO/sub 2/, Co/SiO/sub 2/, Co/Al/sub 2/O/sub 3/, Co/C, and Co/MgO. The specific activity of cobalt decreases significantly with increasing dispersion. Product selectivity is best correlated with dispersion and extent of reduction, i.e., the molecular weight of hydrocarbon products is lower and the CO/sub 2//H/sub 2/O ratio is higher for catalysts having higher dispersions and lower extents of reduction. This effect may be due to stable oxides in the well-dispersed, poorly reduced catalysts, which catalyze the water-gas-shift reaction thereby increasing the H/sub 2//CO ratio at the surface. In the Co/Al/sub 2/O/sub 3/ system, activity and selectivity for high molecular weight hydrocarbons increase very significantly with increasing cobalt loading. A 15% Co/Al/sub 2/O/sub 3/ is 20 times more active than 3% Co/Al/sub 2/O/sub 3/; moreover, 86 wt% of its hydrocarbon fraction is in the C/sub 5/-C/sub 12/ (gasoline) range compared to 18 wt% for 3% Co/Al/sub 2/O/sub 3/. 5 figures, 5 tables.","","","Brigham Young Univ., Provo, Utah","","","United States","1984-01-01T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: J.

These catalysts were characterized by high temperature (323-423 K) hydrogen adsorption and conventional 298 K adsorptions of hydrogen and carbon monoxide. Total surface areas of unsupported cobalt catalysts were measured by BET. Metal crystallite sizes were determined independently from XRD, TEM, and hydrogen adsorption. Extents of reduction were measured by O/sub 2/ titration at 673 K. Hydrogen adsorption on cobalt is activated and reversible; extents of activation and reversibility vary with support, metal loading, and preparation. The hydrogen adsorption stoichiometry is 1.0 hydrogen atom per surface cobalt atom, if total adsorption at the temperature of maximum uptake is considered. The adsorption of CO is nonactivated and reversible; the stoichiometry for irreversible adsorption varies from 0.4 to 2.3 molecules of CO per surface cobalt atom, depending upon support, metal loading, and preparation. Cobalt dispersion and extent of reduction also vary greatly with support, metal loading, and method of preparation.

The results are interpreted in terms of the trade-off between capacity and selectivity. Among classes of solvents, Lewis acids have much more favorable combinations of capacity and selectivity than do Lewis bases. Branching is also favorable, a result which is rationalized through steric (cone angle) factors. Requirements for solvent selectivity can be ameliorated by the use of an extractive-distillation dewatering step, receiving the extract as feed. Other important solvent properties are its volatility in a distillative solvent-recovery step and the ease with which residual solvent may be removed from water by stripping or other means.","","","Department of Chemical Engineering, University of California, Berkeley, California","","","United States","1984-01-01T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: Ind.

Fossil fuel replacement, cogeneration of electricity, and production of methanol by the hybrid process were found to be the most profitable uses of wood wastes at most price configurations. The feasible limits to fossil-fuel replacement and cogeneration are set by the energy and wood requirements of the pulp and paper mills. Another factor is the current low price of natural gas that has led to several methanol projects based on natural gas.

At high temperatures and pressures of H/sub 2/ and CO, a methyl group from each cation is incorporated into methane or ethanol. In the ionizing solvent, N-methylpyrrolidinone, the reaction using iron tetracarbonyl hydride anion is first order in both the methylammonium cation and iron carbonylate anion concentrations and zero order with respect to the partial pressures of hydrogen or carbon monoxide. The enthalpy and entropy of activation, in the temperature range of 180-210/sup 0/C, are 44 kcal/mol and +17 eu, respectively. The second-order rate constants exhibit a primary kinetic salt effect, increasing with decreasing salt concentration. The rate constants also increased with decreasing dielectric constant of the solvent. The data are consistent with methyl group transfers (S/sub N/2) between ions as the rate-limiting step. At 200/sup 0/C and 245 atm (3:1 CO/H/sub 2/) the second-order rate constants, 2.0 x 10/sup -4/ M/sup -1/ s/sup -1/ for Mn(CO)/sub 5//sup -/, are a measure of the nucleophilicities of these carbonylates toward tetramethylammonium ion. In the case of the manganate system, the product selectivity (ethanol vs. methane) was found to be independent of H/sub 2/ or CO partial pressure between 61 and 184 atm but slightly dependent on the concentration of Mn(CO)/sub 5//sup -/.

For this reaction, the isosteric heat varies with surface coverage (theta) from -121 kJ-mol/sup -1/ at theta = 0.5 to -135 kJ-mol/sup -1/ at theta = 0.9. These values correspond to variations in the heat of formation of surface carbon relative to graphite from 52 kJ-mol/sup -1/ at low coverage to 35 kJ-mol/sup -1/ at high coverage. The surface carbon formed at temperatures below 600 K is highly reactive toward hydrogen as compared with a carbon deposit formed at higher temperatures. The experimental data indicate the presence of oxygen adatoms coadsorbed on the nickel surface. Their chemical potential is very low relative to bulk NiO. The heat of formation of O(a) exhibits little dependence on surface coverage. 9 figures, 2 tables.","","","SRI International, Menlo Park, CA","","","United States","1983-12-22T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: J.

Little evidence exists for Ru-Cu interaction in the H/sub 2/ chemisorption. The anions of the impregnating solution and the texture do not directly affect Cu-Ru interactions, but may do so indirectly by their effect on the dispersion of Ru. Apparently nitrate complexes of Ru undergo stronger ion exchange on silica than do chloride containing complexes. The resulting better dispersion of Ru with its accompanying segregation decreases the likelihood of Ru-Cu interaction.

The addition of copper had little influence on hydrogen chemisorption and some spillover from ruthenium to the group IB metal may occur.

The reactivity of surface carbon produced by the disproportionation of CO has been also examined. Special attention has been paid to the effect of supports (TiO/sub 2/, Al/sub 2/O/sub 3/, SiO/sub 2/, MgO) on these processes. Adsorption of CO on differently supported Rh samples at 300 K produced almost identical infrared spectra; the dominant feature was the appearance of the twin CO band. The desorption temperature of CO, T/sub max/ = 463-473 K, was practically the same for all samples. The efficiency of the supports in promoting the dissociation of CO over Rh decreased in the order TiO/sub 2/ > Al/sub 2/O/sub 3/ > SiO/sub 2/ > MgO. Temperature-programmed reaction spectroscopy revealed that different kinds of surface carbon are produced by CO dissociation. The ratios of these forms depends on the temperature of their production, as well as on their thermal treatments. The surface carbon reacted with H/sub 2/ at a lower temperature on Rh/TiO/sub 2/, but the aging of carbon was also fastest on this sample. The activation energy of the hydrogenation of the reactive surface carbon increased in the order Rh/TiO/sub 2/ < Rh/Al/sub 2/O/sub 3/ < Rh/SiO/sub 2/. 8 figures, 3 tables.","","","Univ. of Szeged, Hungary","","","United States","1983-12-01T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: J.

The acetylene and the hydrogen cyanide were coadsorbed at -110 /sup 0/C, and then the crystal was heated. Pyridine desorbed at 100/sup 0/C, the characteristic desorption temperature for Pd-NC/sub 5/H/sub 5/. Attempts to hydrogenate pyridine on this surface were unsuccessful. The following hydrogenation reactions have been demonstrated on Pd: acetylene to ethylene (50%), ethylene to ethane (25%), benzene to cyclohexane (5%), and norbornadiene to norbornane (5 to 10%) as well as olefin formation from propyne, 2-butyne, and 2-pentyne. Typical experiment consisted of adsorption of hydrogen and then adsorption of the hydrocarbon at -130/sup 0/C and the thermal desorption at 25/sup 0/C/s. Appearance of the hydrogenated product occurred at ca 0/sup 0/ to 25/sup 0/C.

Iron carbonyl, enriched in /sup 57/Fe for Moessbauer spectroscopy studies, was produced in situ and entrained with the carbon monoxide feed to a methanation reactor operating at temperatures of 620 to 650 K and H/sub 2//CO ratios near 7. This incorporation of Fe into the nickel catalyst via the decomposition of Fe(CO)/sub 5/ resulted in significant catalyst deactivation as well as changes in the parameters of a power law rate expression describing the methanation kinetics. With increasing amounts of Fe deposited on the catalyst, the kinetic parameters were shifted toward those of iron catalysts. These iron-induced phenomena are due to (1) pore-mouth blocking of the Al/sub 2/O/sub 3/ micropore structure by iron particles formed during the diffusion-limited decomposition of Fe(CH)/sub 5/, and (2) interactions between iron and nickel in the macropores of the support. Specifically, the loss of catalyst activity is primarily caused by pore-mouth blocking, while shifts in kinetic parametsrs are the consequence of both pore-mouth blocking and interactions between iron and nickel. The majority of the iron deposited under methanation reaction conditions has been identified as chi-carbide (Haegg carbide) using Moessbauer spectroscopy at liquid helium temperature. 55 references, 7 figures, 4 tables.","","","Univ. of Wisconsin, Madison","","","United States","1983-11-01T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: J.

The results of these experiments have revealed stable steady states, sustained periodic oscillations and nonperiodic states. An excess of nitrogen in the feed gas stream leads to simpler single-peaked catalyst temperature oscillations of increasing periods of time - up to 5 min. Small amounts of water vapor produced nonperiodic states at all times. These factors indicate that an interplay of heat and mass transfer, convection, and a heterogeneous mechanism is the cause of the phenomena observed during the oxidation of ammonia by air on platinum, at atmospheric pressure.

High resolution electron energy loss spectroscopy (EELS) is used for a post reaction study of the catalyst surface. An iron monocrystal (110) surface was used as a model catalyst. Fischer-Tropsch synthesis (FTS) reactions were performed in the reaction chamber, with the iron surface at 300/sup 0/C, using a total pressure of 1 atm at a fixed H/sub 2//CO ratio. After the reaction the iron sample was transferred into the UHV chamber and subsequently analyzed by EELS. Among the observed vibrational losses those at 870 and 3100 cm/sup -1/ are characteristic for surface CH and those at 1420 and 3010 cm/sup -1/ for CH/sub 2/ groups. An additional loss at 1200 cm/sup -1/ is possibly due to a C/sub 2/ species on the active surface. Experiments using a carbon pre-covered iron surface in a pure hydrogen atmosphere (1 atm 300/sup 0/C) produced similar EELS spectra. The present results add to the body of work which indicates that the methanation reaction and the FTS proceed through the hydrogenation of surface carbon. Further, the EELS spectra provide direct evidence for the presence of partially hydrogenated carbon on the active Fe(110) surface. These hydrocarbon species are CH/sub 2/ and probably a mixture of CH and CCH/sub 2/. It is possible that some or all of these species are reaction intermediates under synthesis conditions. 26 references, 3 figures.","","","Kernforschungsanlage Juelich GmbH, Germany","","","United States","1983-11-01T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: J.

However, reducing the catalyst at temperatures up to a maximum of 400/sup 0/C caused significant changes in both the supported Rh and the ZnO support. The relative intensity of the Rh 3d/sub 5/2/ peak compared with that of the Zn 3d peak decreased, and its peak shifted to lower binding energy. The buildup of intensity at higher kinetic energy is indicative of Zn/sup 2 +/ which has been reduced to Zn/sup 0/. Conclusion is that the Rh somehow stabilizes the Zn, possibly as an alloy. The results of treating the catalyst in a mixture of 400 torr of H/sub 2/ and 200 torr of CO at 200/sup 0/C for 3 h produced distinctly different results. Two Rh 3d/sub 5/2/ peaks were observed. The peak at 409 eV is similar to that of the untreated catalyst, indicating that most of the Rh must be highly dispersed, possibly as Rh carbonyls. The presence of the peak at 307.8 eV and the decrease of the Rh (3d)/Zn(3d) ratio also suggest that some agglomeration has occurred. As far as the support is concerned the Zn Auger peak did not change, indicating that the spectrum obtained was identical to that of the untreated material. These results seem to indicate that CO inhibits the absorption of H/sub 2/ on the Rh and that insufficient H/sub 2/ is present to reduce the ZnO. Even under mild conditions, metal support interactions should not be overlooked. 6 references, 2 figures, 1 table.","","","","","","United States","1983-11-01T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: J.

The standard free energies, ..delta..G, for micellization are similar in the two solvents (-9.6 kcal mol/sup -1/ for water and -7.8 kcal mol/sup -1/ for hydrazine for sodium dodecyl sulfate). The corresponding ..delta..H/sup 0/ values (-6.1 and -13.3 kcal mol/sup -1/, respectively) and ..delta..S values (11 and -18 gibbs mol/sup -1/, respectively) are very different. The differences between hydrazine and water are attributed to a large positive increment in both ..delta..H(H/sub 2/O) and ..delta..S(H/sub 2/O) accompanying the transfer of the surfactant hydrocarbon chain out of water. These increments nearly compensate each other and thus make only a small contribution to the free energy in the temperature range 25-45/sup 0/C. This interpretation is bolstered by the almost identical free energy of transfer of a methylene group from water (-0.76 kcal mol/sup -1/) and hydrazine (-0.71 kcal mol/sup -1/) to the micelle. These results suggest that the lipophobic properties of water and hydrazine are very similar and that the unique properties of water do not play a dominant role in the equilibrium properties of this liquid.

Observation of the intraligand C-O stretching mode (273 meV, 2202 cm/sup -1/) and its first overtone (539 meV, 4348 cm/sup -1/) verify that the CO molecule adsorbed at low coverages under ultrahigh-vacuum (UHV) conditions on (1010) is indeed the same '' high frequency'' CO observed on ZnO powders. In addition, observation of the Zn-C metal-ligand stretch (31 meV, 250 cm/sup -1/) enables application of a normal mode calculation which indicates that the majority of the increased CO stretching frequency is due to an increase in the CO force constant and not just due to mechanical coupling to the surface.

Raising the temperature of the CO + H layer to 295 K shows significant H-CO interactions. Preliminary NIS experiments for H/sub 2//CO gas mixtures under flow conditions indicate that the adsorbed layer present under reaction conditions, i.e., during substantial (approx. 50%) conversion of CO to hydrocarbons (450 K) is dominated by the same adsorbates which are found under non reactive (i.e., no conversion of CO to hydrocarbons) conditions (300 K). 3 figures.","","","National Bureau of Standards, Washington, DC","","","United States","1983-10-01T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: J.

XRD supplied information on relative reaction rates and direct determination of chemical structure throughout the reduction process. Reductions was performed in 2 or 5% hydrogen in nitrogen at 250 C. A flow of 70 cm/sup 3//min was maintained, thus providing a convenient time frame for analysis. The experimental apparatus was determined to be air tight because reoxidation did not occur after extended periods under reaction conditions. XRD peaks were used to monitor the course of the reaction at 15 min intervals. The intensities were converted to respective wt % by a direct comparison method. Experimental conversion factors were determined from intensity ratios of standard mixtures of Cu, Cu/sub 2/O and CuO. The reduction of CuO by hydrogen has been observed to go through an intermediate Cu/sub 2/O phase.

The rate of carbon monoxide hydrogenation was measured by temperature-programmed reaction (TPR) for comparison. The rate of carbon hydrogenation to methane was found to be independent of the support and an average activation energy of 42 kJ/mol was estimated. In contrast, the rate of carbon monoxide hydrogenation was very sensitive to the catalyst support. Nickel (Ni) supported on TiO/sub 2/ exhibited the highest specific activity, and two distinct sites for methanation were observed on Ni/TiO/sub 2/ and Ni/Al/sub 2/O/sub 3/. The lowest specific activities were observed for Ni/SiO/sub 2/ and Ni/SiO/sub 2/.Al/sub 2/O/sub 3/. For all catalysts, carbon hydrogenation occurred at a lower temperature than carbon monoxide hydrogenation. For both TPR and TPSR, small amounts of ethane were formed and at a lower temperature than methane. The amount of less-active, ..beta..-carbon observed in TPSR experiments was very small on all catalysts. These results indicate that at high coverages, carbon hydrogenation does not depend on the support, and thus it is not rate-determining for CO hydrogenation in excess hydrogen. The support is also shown to change the specific rate of carbon monoxide methanation; activity differences seen in steady-state experiments are not just due to differences in site densities. 5 figures, 5 tables.","","","Univ. of Colorado, Boulder","","","United States","1983-10-01T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: J.

The cyclopropylidene complex thus formed, then rearranges to the homologous vinylidene species. Equations which describe branched isomer distributions are derived from the theory and are used to fit observed distributions for a fused iron catalyst and a precipitated cobalt catalyst. The model has one adjustable parameter, and the fit includes the methyl and the ethyl branching characteristics of Fischer-Tropsch catalysis which were previously unaccounted for by methylene polymerization theories. 5 figures, 2 tables.","","","Exxon Research and Engineering Co., Linden, NJ","","","United States","1983-10-01T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: J.

The deactivation function giving the best fit to both the cracking and coking reaction data was an exponential one related to the coke content of the catalyst. The kinetic mechanism for coking that gave the best fit was one in which parallel and consecutive coking reactions occurred simultaneously. Apparently, more coke forms from products than reactants, especially at higher temperature.","","","Department of Chemical and Metallurgical Engineering, The University of Alabama, University, Alabama","","","United States","1983-10-01T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: Ind.

The rate constants of disappearance of adsorbed species on 0.5% Pd/Al/sub 2/O/sub 3/ under the reaction conditions were also measured from the transient responses of IR spectra. The intensities of the bands due to surface formate did not change with time, showing that the surface formate is not an intermediate. The rate constants of disappearance of adsorbed CO (linear CO and bridge CO) were essentially identical with each other and were in good agreement with the rate constant of CH/sub 4/ formation measured by PSRA (pulse surface reaction rate analysis).

It was found that a monovalent copper species was present in the surface of the catalysts with low copper contents. It was revealed that two distinct types of copper metal species, both of them being negatively charged by electron transfer from ZnO, were produced in the catalyst surface upon the reduction. In the high copper content catalysts (> 25 wt % CuO), the predominant Cu metal species is described by well-dispersed metal particles, whereas in the low copper content catalysts (< 10 wt % CuO), the major copper metal species is best characterized by a two-dimensional epitaxial copper layer over ZnO. It is concluded that both the two-dimensional copper metal and Cu/sup +/ are formed from Cu/sup 2 +/ dissolved in a ZnO lattice, while the copper metal particles are originating mainly from crystalline and amorphous copper oxide phases. The two-dimensional copper metal species was found to be preferentially reoxidized to Cu/sup +/ when exposed to air at room temperature. The two-dimensional Cu/sup 0/-Cu/sup +/ species are suggested to be catalytically active for the methanol synthesis at low temperature and pressure. The reduction of ZnO was observed only when reduced at 500/sup 0/C and in the presence of copper.

The rate-determining step was found to be the C-O bond dissociation of the adsorbed CO species. The rate constant for the C-O bond dissociation process per adsorbed CO molecule was determined at various temperatures and Arrhenius parameters of the rate constant were obtained. The rate constant in flowing deuterium (D/sub 2/)(k/sub D/) was considerably larger than that in flowing H/sub 2/(k/sub H/), indicating an inverse isotope effect. The average value of k/sub H//k/sub D/ was 0.61. The extent of the inverse isotope effect for Pd was more significant than that for nickel (Ni)(k/sub H//k/sub D/ = 0.75). The preexponential factor for k/sub H/ on Pd (1.6 x 10/sup 4/s/sup -1/) was much smaller than that on Ni (5.4 x 10/sup 6/s/sup -1/). It was concluded that adsorbed CO is not directly dissociated to surface carbon and oxygen atoms but hydrogen atoms play an important role in the C-O bond dissociation. Further details of the mechanism for the C-O bond dissociation were discussed from the observed kinetics and isotope effects. 5 figures.","","","","","","United States","1983-09-15T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: J.

Surface and bulk characterization of the fresh and oxidized alloys has been carried out by the combined use of several techniques: ion scattering spectroscopy (ISS), X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS, ESCA), electron microscopy (EM), and X-ray diffraction (XRD). The results show that the surfaces of the fresh alloys are nickel-poor compared to the bulk. Oxidation treatment further decreases the surface nickel content. However, nickel-rich alloys (Ni/sub 5/Si/sub 2/, Ni/sub 2/Si) exhibit relative surface enrichment in nickel as compared to the remaining intermetallics. Furthermore, they present, upon oxidation, evidence of partial decomposition whereas silicon-rich alloys are essentially stable.

The compounds that copolymerize with oxygen to produce polyperoxides require the least amount of oxygen to yield a mg of gum; among other pure hydrocarbons and fuels, the rates of gum formation and oxygen absorption decrease together. The most useful approach to understanding and reducing gum and deposit formation will come through understanding the effects of condensed aromatic and heterocyclic compounds on the oxidation rates of fuels. 4 figures. 4 tables.","","","SRI International, Menlo Park, CA","","","United States","1983-09-01T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: Am.

From this comparison we conclude that, in the pressure range of our work, CO on Ni(110) simply dissociates by the rupture of the CO bond. The activation energy of the process has been evaluated (23 kcal/mole) and found in excellent agreement with recent generalized valence bond calculations. Our finding, of course, does not imply that this is the dominant mechanism of carbon formation in Fischer-Tropsch synthesis (which is run at much higher CO pressures). 6 figures.","","","Universita della Calabria, Cosenza, Italy","","","United States","1983-09-01T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: J.

Crude methanol also contains a large number of trace impurities, which need to be removed with the fraction collected from the PDC distillate, with minimum loss of methanol. Therefore, the height of the rectifying section of the PDC is chosen in accordance with the height of the zone in which these impurities are concentrated.

In order to examine the role of convection, a broad range of Damkohler numbers are used which characterize the ratio between the gas-dynamic and chemical time, and the concentrational limits in the field of an external force (gravity) and when g=O are compared. A methane-air mixture is investigated. The motion of a gaseous fuel mixture in a plane vessel of quadratic cross section is described by nonsteady two-dimensional NavierStokes equations, taking account of the consumption of the reagent present in adequate amounts, in a first-order exothermal chemical reaction. The aim of the calculation of the concentration limits is to establish the dependence of the Damkohler number on a parameter which characterizes the initial mixture composition. Improvements are made in a numerical method allowing the process of combustion-source development in a closed vessel to be modeled on the basis of sufficiently complete nonsteady two-dimensional equations of motion of the reacting gas, and allowing the limits of ignition of the fuel mixture with a subcritical initial state to be calculated. It is shown that convection leads to different concentrational limits in the ignition of a fuel mixture.","","","Moscow","","","United States","1983-09-01T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: Combust., Explos.

Representative aromatic hydrocarbons have been reduced by this new reagent largely to monoalkenes. Hydrocarbons like tetralin, m- and p-xylene, and indan are reduced in excellent yields by the calcium system to a crude product containing 88% or better of a single alkene. A new technique involving oxymercuration-demercuration is used to purify two of the monoalkene isomer mixtures obtained in these reductions. Unexpectedly, durene is reduced by the calcium reagent to 1,2,4,5-tetramethyl-1,4-cyclohexadiene in excellent yield. Likewise anthracene is reduced in one step to 1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10-decahydroanthracene.

The production of alcohol fuels is discussed in terms of the two major products, ethanol and methanol. Improvements in alcohol production have come about via research and development of fermentation ethanol and methanol and thermochemical ethanol and methanol. Historically, the cost of methanol has almost always been less than that of ethanol because the selling prices of the alcohols correlate with the embedded feedstock costs. It is expected that by the late 1980s both methanol and ethanol can be made from biomass at prices competitive with petroleum-based products. 7 tables.","","","","","","United States","1983-08-01T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: Energy Top.; (United States)","","Medium: X; Size: Pages: 1-6","","","","Journal ID: CODEN: ETOPD","","","2009-12-16T00:00:00Z","5734369","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/5734369","","Energy Top.; (United States)","",""

It is particularly useful for ethanol fermentation over gel beads containing immobilized viable cells, where the beads can be ruptured by gas production and the growth of cells within the gels. This method consists of treating agar or carrageenan gel with polyacrylamide to form a rigid support which retains the high catalytic activity characteristic of the untreated biocatalysts. The size and shape of the biocatalyst is unaffected by this treatment. The method involves the diffusion of acrylamide, N,N'-methylenebisacrylamide and ..beta..-dimethylaminopropionitrile (or N,N,N',N'-tetramethylethylenediamine) into the preformed biocatalyst beads followed by the addition of an initiator to cause polymerization within the beads. Treated gels have been used for the continuous fermentation of glucose to ethanol in a packed column for over two months. During this operation, the gel beads maintained their rigidity, and the maximum productivity was as high as 50 gh/sup -1/ L/sup -1/ gel.

The relative selectivities of these two products are determined by experimental factors which affect competition between reductive elimination and carbonylation of this hydroxymethylmetal species. Ethanol and its derivatives may also be formed from a hydroxymethyl intermediate which is first transformed into a metal-methylidene complex via dehydration, and then to a metal-methyl complex via hydration. This general mechanism rationally accounts for changes in the primary product distribution which occur when certain reaction parameters are varied. 8 figures.","","","Halcon SD Group Research Center, Montvale, NJ","","","United States","1983-08-01T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: Catal.

In consequence the T-Q path of furnace gases from a superior fuel may be exactly matched with an inferior fuel if additional input enthalpy is made available. The H * concept permits quantitative formulation of RTV, relative thermal value, the value for use i furnaces of a Btu in a subject fuel compared to its value in a standard superior fuel. The concept also permits limited modeling of furnace performance of good fuels with poor ones, using a fuel-fired air preheater.

Using a copper-aluminum-calcium catalyst for low-temperature conversion of carbon monoxide as an example, we studied the influence of the tableting pressure on its pore volume, specific surface, bulk density, mechanical strength, and catalytic activity. Strengthening and compaction of the catalyst is due mainly to collapse of pores larger than 300 angstrom in radius; decrease of the contribution of pores smaller than 100 angstrom is accompanied by decrease of specific surface, while decrease of the content of pores 100-200 angstrom in radius leads to increase of diffusion resistance and to all of catalytic activity.","","","","","","United States","1983-07-10T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: J.

Unfortunately, the combustion of some of them is awkward and inconvenient for many energy end-use applications. An approach to a synthetic fuels and natural fuels program should be along the following lines: Utilize natural gas and normal petroleum, preferably as transportation fuels; maintain exploration for both; utilize heavy oils and accelerate exploration; develop utilization of oil shale; maintain exploration for shale; utilize coals where conversion is not necessary; develop coal conversion processes; and develop biomass conversion processes. A more detailed analysis could uncover fallacies or poor assumptions and possibly shift priorities.

It is accomplished on copper-containing catalysts. All low-temperature catalysts lose activity in the process of use, and the residual carbon monoxide concentration gradually rises from 0.1-0.2% to 0.5-0.6%. The lifespan of catalysts is from 1-3 years. The causes of catalyst deactivation and methods to prevent it were researched. A composition for chlorine absorption (PKh) was worked out for the low-temperature catalyst. The first experimental lot of the absorbent was used at the Cherkassy Azot PA in the ammonia production plant as a protective layer before the low-temperature catalyst in the second stage industrial converter. Data showed the absorbent was capable of adsorbing not only chlorine, but also other substance which were harmful to the catalyst. 2 tables.

The activity for methanol synthesis is linearly correlated with the amount of Pd extractable from the reduced and used catalysts as Pd-acetylacetonate. Since it is known that promoters also create a new type of ionic adsorption center for CO and NO adsorption, it is concluded that Pd ions are indeed the centers for activation of CO toward methanol whereas Pd metal supplies hydrogen atoms for hydrogenation.","","","State Univ. of Leiden, Netherlands","","","United States","1983-07-01T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: J.

Predictions of equilibrium behavior in systems containing methanol were satisfactory if the solute composition in the liquid was limited to approximately 5 mol % nitrogen or 30 mol % for the other components. Parameters evaluated, and their correlations with temperature, were used to illustrate predictions of multicomponent system behavior.

Higher pressure was found to decrease the amount of gaseous hydrocarbon produced, while increasing the space velocity had the opposite effect. An optimum temperature of 623 K was found to maximize the amount of liquid paraffins and aromatics with a corresponding minimum in gaseous hydrocarbons.

The turnover frequency (TOF) for CO hydrogenation to CH/sub 4/ was constant over this range of Pt crystallite size on a given support. However, the support utilized had a major influence on specific activity and TOF values on Pt/TiO/sub 2/ catalysts were 10 times greater than those on Pt/Al/sub 2/O/sub 3/ and Pt/SiO/sub 2/-Al/sub 2/O/sub 3/ and 100-fold higher than the TOF on Pt/SiO/sub 2/. A model for methanation invoking H-assisted CO bond rupture as the rate determining step correlated the different kinetic parameters measured over these Pt catalysts. Analysis of this model using transition state theory provided an estimate of the maximum active site density and, in agreement with in situ ir spectroscopic studies, indicated that only a small fraction (0.01 or less) of the surface Pt atoms constitute active sites on TiO/sub 2/-supported Pt. The alteration in catalytic behavior for TiO/sub 2/-supported Pt is attributed to a change in structure of the Pt crystallites caused by a strong interaction with partially reduced titania surface. The observed enhancement in activity after reduction at only 473 K implies that this effect is localized and not dependent on bulk electronic properties.","","","","","","United States","1983-07-01T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: J.

From the experimental evidence presented here, we conclude that this reaction involves the homogeneous reduction of CO to chloromethane, followed by homologation and/or hydrogenation reactions leading to the hydrocarbon products.

As has been the case for heterogeneous catalysis and catalysis by organometallic clusters, many investigators are studying the potential of homogeneous complexes to selectivity produce desired products from synthesis gas. In many cases, the homogeneous approaches appear to be a superior approach. The declining price of petroleum is an inhibiting factor in the development of these processes.

With a freshly reduced and evacuated sample of one of the catalysts. H/sub 2/ chemisorption was investigated as a function of the temperature (30 < T < 100/sup 0/C). It was found that the slope of the magnetization-volume isotherm decreased with increasing temperature, which does not agree with the theory of superparamagnetism. The smaller slope at more elevated temperatures was ascribed to a more extensive coverage of the smaller nickel particles after admission of the initial H/sub 2/ doses. Carburization of the catalysts was established by the decomposition of methane (CH/sub 4/) at temperatures from 30 to 300/sup 0/C. At low surface coverages the carbon was deposited as Ni/sub 3/C strongly affecting the magnetization. At higher surface coverages CH/sub x/-complexes without any effect on the magnetization were chemisorbed. After the decomposition of CH/sub 4/, the catalysts were evacuated at 250/sup 0/C, which was found to result in the conversion of a part of the carbonaceous deposit into methane. Also with the subsequent chemisorption of hydrogen on the carburized catalysts (T = 30/sup 0/C) the reaction between chemisorbed H-atoms and deposited carbon was apparent from the production of CH/sub 4/. From a comparison of the magnetization-volume isotherms for H/sub 2/ chemisorption before and after the deposition of small amounts of carbon it was derived that the decomposition of methane preferentially proceeds on small nickel crystallites. Finally it was found that hydrogen was adsorbed not only on bare nickel (with magnetic effect) but also on nickel carbide (without magnetic effect). 7 figures, 2 tables.","","","","","","United States","1983-06-01T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: J.

As the Pt dispersion decreased to 80% (CO/Pt = 0.70) and then 70% (CO/Pt = 0.64) as a result of pretreatment in O/sub 2/ and H/sub 2/, the fraction of CO that desorbed in the low-temperature peak decreased and the fraction of CO that desorbed in the broad desorption band increased. At Pt dispersions below 40%, only a broad desorption band was obtained, a result which is in agreement with data reported by others. The low-temperature peak is interpreted as desorption of CO from very small Pt particles (< 20 atoms, < 1.1 nm) supported on transitional Al/sub 2/O/sub 3/. The broad desorption band is interpreted as CO desorption from larger Pt particles. Results from experiments performed at different heating rates indicate that the enthalpy of CO adsorption in the state that corresponds to the low-temperature peak is 74 +- 4 kJ mol/sup -1/, an adsorption energy which is lower than energies obtained from measurements of CO desorption from Pt single crystal surfaces. 5 figures.","","","General Motors Research Labs., Warren, MI","","","United States","1983-06-01T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: J.

Therefore, quantum-chemical calculations of structure were needed to model the rearrangement of the electron density in the intermediate state. A LCAO method was used to calculate the deforming force which arises at the nuclei of the molecule during its electronic rearrangement. The analysis showed that the dehydration of ethanol is promoted by capture of an electron from the catalyst by the adsorbed molecule.

Near stoichiometric the molecular and radical species are assumed to be in partial equilibrium and the burnout of CO is controlled by the rate of recombination of the radicals in three-body reactions. The composition and reaction rates for the excess moles are expressible in terms of two variables, the mixture fraction and the excess moles. Calculations for these two variables have been carried out in laminar and turbulent jet diffusion flames and the predicted composition compared with experimental data. In broad terms the agreement is good and the prediction of CO on the lean and rich sides of both laminar and turbulent flames is particularly encouraging.

Provisions are made for sampling for mass spectrometry and for temperature measurement. Temperature profiles for the two flames show that the temperature rise for the flame with fuel introduced as a vapor begins at a greater distance from the luminous zone than the aerosolfueled flame.

In the ignition of a fuel drop in an incident shock wave, the characteristic time of occurrence of the physical processes responsible for preparation of the system for combustion correlates with the start of stripping-off of a layer of liquid from the drop. In weak shock waves (M<3.5), the ignition delay of the fuel drop is determined mainly by the induction period of the chemical reactions, and in strong shock waves by the time of occurrence of the preparatory processes; ignition of the drop in strong shock waves can take place at the start of ''stripping-off'' (or earlier) at the surface of the drop.

Alkaline earths and aluminum nitrate, which were not direct catalysts for the hydrogasification of carbon, enhanced methane formation markedly, while nitrates of potassium, chronmium, and iron and also potassium carbonate had almost no effect. Additives which are effective are believed to be in the form of an oxide. In the presence of nickel, methane is formed at two separate regions: 400 to 700/sup 0/C and above 750/sup 0/C. All the promoters increased conversion in the lower temperature reaction while only calcium salt enhanced it in the higher temperature reaction. Promoters, especially magnesium, extensively suppressed the sintering of nickel. The enhancement of methane formation at lower temperatures is ascribeed to the increased dispersion of nickel.

This information is necessary for selection of the conditions both for partial and for complete oxidation of alcohols which is important for ''afterburning'' of vapor-air mixtures containing alcohols. In this last case the use of molten oxidizing catalysts should be more effective than the use of solid-phase catalysts. For determination of the degree of saturation of the catalyst with atmospheric oxygen and of the optimal oxidation temperature, the dynamics of sorption and desorption of atmospheric oxygen by the molten catalyst was also studied. Study of the dependence of absorption of atmospheric oxygen by molten catalyst of the composition K/sub 2/O-V/sub 2/O/sub 5/ (61 mole %) on temperature showed that oxidation of the catalyst should preferably be conducted in the temperature range 540-630/sup 0/. The existence of chemisorbed oxygen in melts of this composition has been demonstrated, and the temperature at which its desorption begins (530-540/sup 0/) has been determined. It was shown that the selectivity of butanol oxidation depends on the saturation of the molten catalyst with oxygen. The presence of dissolved oxygen favors exhaustive oxidation of butanol and of the products of its conversion, whereas in absence of oxygen the selectivity of the reaction for products of partial oxidation increases.","","","Academy of Sciences of the USSR","","","United States","1983-04-20T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: J.

As a rule, AS are organic compounds of low water content that have an active functional group and are disposed to charge transfer. Water, which must be present for efficient complex formation, intensifies the activator effect only up to a definite limit. In the literature the problem of the water effect has been interpreted mainly from the viewpoint of elucidating its influence on the yield and quantity of carbamide deparaffination products without regard for the nature of the effect. It has been shown that water increases the dipole moment in the reaction system, increases the intermolecular interaction of AS with carbamide, and favors a decrease in crystal size. In the present work the effect of water on carbamide has been defined more accurately; carbamide-water systems (mainly suspensions) have been investigated by proton magnetic resonance (PMR), nuclear quadrupole resonance (NQR), x-ray diffraction, and photomicrography, In the amounts used in the deparaffination of petroleum products with carbamide, water practically does not change the crystal system of carbamide, although there is limited deformation.","","","S.M.

We present data which support a multiply coordinated C adsorption site and demonstrates a facile transformation from carbidic to graphitic carbon forms on the Rh surface under thermal annealing. This transformation is shown to manifest itself in the CO/sub 2//H/sub 2/ reaction by a low temperature deactivation of the catalyst surface.","","","Sandia National Laboratories, Albuquerque, New Mexico 87185","","","United States","1983-04-01T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: J.

A direct spray nozzle with the same construction was used in the experiments and the parameters of the counterflowing air remained approximately the same. The preliminary stage of the investigations, performed with fuel injected into the ocmoving, passing, and counterflowing air flow, showed that stable combustion of the liquid fuel was possible only in the case of counterflow fuel injection. It was demonstrated that the hitting distance and diameter of the jet of boron containing fuel turned out to be approximately two times shorter than that of the hydrocarbon fuel, and 1.5 times greater than that of hydrogen fuel. Therefore, the borohydrocarbon jet vaporized two times more rapidly in the counterflowing high-temperature air flow than a hydrocarbon jet.

Relative to reaction under homogeneous solution conditions, the intercalated catalysts exhibit a much lower tendency to isomerize the substrate to the less reactive internal olefin 2-hexene. In the case of Rh(NBD)(PPh/sub 3/)/sub 2//sup +/-hectorite, the dramatic dependence of the hexane: 2-hexene product ratio on substrate concentration and water content indicates that the intrinsic Bronsted acidity of partially hydrated Na/sup +/ ions in the clay interlayers causes the protonic equilibrium between surface intermediates responsible for the isomerization and hydrogenation pathways to be shifted in favvor of hydrogenation. Rh(NBD)(dppe)/sup +/-hectorite also favors hydrogenation over isomerization relative to homogeneous solution. In this case, however, a catalytically important protonic equilibrium is not involved in the reaction mechanism, and the reaction is insensitive to factors which influence surface acidity. The results demonstrate that surface chemical effects can dramatically alter the catalytic properties of metal complexes immobilized in clay interlayers.","","","Michigan State Univ., East Lansing","","","United States","1983-03-01T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: J.

In combustion turbine engines in a dual cycle it shows much higher efficiencies in lower cost power plants than modern coal fired steam boilers and gives low cost electric power. Always it burns with less pollutants. It can be regasified to Substitute Natural Gas cheaply and efficiently. Thus natural gas more than several thousand miles away can be converted to methanol for transport by sea or land more cheaply than piping the gas or liquifying it and shipment as LNG. Methanol may be regasified anywhere enroute or it may be used as a liquid fuel.

Some of the most important considerations that would influence a decision to choose LH/sub 2/ are discussed. The author emphasizes that advantages claimed for LH/sub 2/ are based largely on theory and analysis and explains that although experience with LH/sub 2/ in the US space program provided a good background for evolution of the aircraft designs, the aircraft application is sufficiently different that new component designs and operational procedures must be developed.

In the present work, a method is proposed for calculating the concentration of fuel and diluent at phlegmatization points. The fuel components considered are organic materials consisting of the atoms C, H, O, N, for which it is valid to assume that combustion is two-stage in character, and the diluents are N/sub 2/, CO/sub 2/, H/sub 2/O and hydrocarbon halides.

Several previous experiments were analyzed to concretize the mechanism by which the rate of reaction is changed. The experiments were performed under conditions of electric field strength and nitrogen molecule density such that highly efficient oscillatory excitation is realized. Replacement of nitrogen with argon in the original fuel mixture led to a significant decrease in the rise in combustion rate. Methane/air and methane/oxygen mixtures were tested in an electric field of frequency 6 mHz and intensity 1.67 kV/cm. Selective excitation of oscillatory levels of nitrogen molecules by electrons, with further transfer of oscillatory energy to oxygen molecules explains, in principle, the effect of an AC electric field on normal combustion rate. However, the required experimental and theoretical data for complete proof of the proposed mechanism are absent at present.","","","Balashikha","","","United States","1983-01-01T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: Combust., Explos.

The catalysts, supported on alumina, are active in the Fischer-Tropsch synthesis, producing increasing fractions of long-chain hydrocarbons and olefins with increasing alkali content. The NO chemisorption spectra on the reduced catalysts are complex, but major features include bands indicative of Fe/sup 2 +/ and Fe/sup 0/ sites. On oxidized catalysts, the band ascribed to Fe/sup 0/ disappears, while bands corresponding to more oxidized species such as nitrates or nitrites are evident. With increasing alkali loading, the major NO bands exhibit a shift to lower frequencies. With the reduced catalysts, increasing the potassium loading results in a decrease in the Fe/sup 0/ band and an increase in the more oxidized NO species. In the presence of gas-phase H/sub 2/, the NO band corresponding to Fe/sup 0/ is substantially greater with these same catalysts. The results are interpreted in terms of the electron donor properties of potassium on the iron catalyst surface. It is suggested that a delicate balance exists between associative and dissociative chemisorption of NO with these catalysts.","","","Amoco Oil Co., Naperville, IL","","","United States","1983-01-01T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: J.

The mass percentage of ethanol was varied from zero to 80% at light load and zero to 50% at full load. Digitized cylinder pressure data were cycle averaged and used to examine ignition delay and to calculate heat release patterns and NO production. It is shown that the ignition delay is increased by the thermodynamic effects of fumigation, but it can be decreased by chemical effects of alcohol reactions if the cylinder gas temperature is above approximately 900 K (1600/sup 0/R). The heat release model uses three zones; a diesel fuel-ethanol zone, an air-ethanol zone and a products zone. The mode predicts that fumigation causes a large increase in the initial burning spike even when the fumigation decreases the ignition delay. Fumigation decreases combustion duration slightly at heavy load but greatly increases the duration at light loads. Values of NO concentration computed from the product zone properties and Zeldovich kinetics predict the observed exhaust NO trends, but are about twice too high in value.","","","Department of Mechanical Engineering, University of Wisconsin-Madison, Madison, WI 53706","","","United States","1983-01-01T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: Am.

When potassium was added to the platinum surface, the carbonaceous deposits showed a higher hydrogen content, with a higher activation energy for its desorption, an increase up to 4 kcal/mol more than for the clean platinum case. The inhibition of the dehydrogenation of adsorbed hydrocarbon species in the presence of coadsorbed potassium on the platinum surface explains the changes of reactivity that are reported. 22 references, 10 figures, 2 tables.","","","Lawrence Berkeley Lab., CA","","","United States","1983-01-01T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: J.

Residence times were 0.55-1.7 s, and initial partial pressures of ethylbenzene (H/sub 2/O diluent) were 0.05-0.17 atm. The rate of appearance of toluene measures (1) the rate of the reaction C/sub 6/H/sub 5/C/sub 2/H/sub 5/ ..-->.. C/sub 6/H/sub 5/CH/sub 3/ + CH/sub 3/, with log k = 15.70 - 74.49 +/- 3.2/theta. From the activation energy, E/sub 0/ for the decomposition is estimated to be 72.2 +/- 3.2 kcal/mol. The results are compatible with those of Esteban et al. (2), for which regression analysis gives log k/sub 1/ = 14.79 - 70.76/theta. A composite, log k = 15.10 - 72.0/theta, fits both sets of data and is experimentally indistinguishable from Robaugh and Stein's (3) recent estimate by the VLPP technique or other estimates in the literature (4-6). In light of the high overall conversion of ethylbenzene studied (2-80%), the industrial-type flow equipment, and the widely differing methods of characterization and analysis, the excellent agreement with the results of (2,3,5) is worthy of note. The data are compatible with current estimates of the heat of formation of benzyl radicals (6,7).","","","Lawrence Berkeley Lab., CA","","","United States","1983-01-01T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: Int.

The extent of the suppression was increased remarkably when the sulfur content in the catalysts became high (as high as 0.3 in terms of the atomic ratio S/Pt). However, XPS and ir results showed little change both in the total amount of sulfur and in the relative amount of sulfide and sulfate through the course of the pretreatments. Furthermore, there was the close correlation between the decrease (or increase) in the amount of H/sub 2/ chemisorption and the amount of H/sub 2/ (or O/sub 2/) consumption during the pretreatments. These results indicate that the suppression cannot be explained with such a simple mechanism as poisoning via reversible redox reaction of sulfur. We propose the following reaction as a plausible redox reaction taking place during the pretreatments: Pt + Al/sub 2/O/sub 3/ Pt Al/sub 2/O/sub 2/ (or PtAl/sub 2/3 2/3(Al/sub 2/O/sub 3/) with hydrogen at 500/sup 0/C in equilibrium with 1/2 O/sub 2/ at 450/sup 0/C), where Pt Al/sub 2/O/sub 2/ represents the composition of surface species consistent with the quantity of H/sub 2/ (and O/sub 2/) consumed. This mechanism suggests the existence of a metal-support interaction in the Pt/Al/sub 2/O/sub 3/ system. The role of sulfur is presumably to catalyze (as a promoter) this reaction, although the detailed mechanism will be the subject of further investigation.","","","","","","United States","1983-01-01T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: J.

During reaction, kinetic data were obtained simultaneously with ir spectra using a special ir reactor cell. Turnover frequencies on Pt were found to vary more than 100-fold as the support material varied, and the activity ranking of these catalysts was: Pt/TiO/sub 2/ (SMSI) > Pt/TiO/sub 2/ (LT) greater than or equal to Pt/eta-Al/sub 2/O/sub 3/ approx. = Pt/SiO/sub 2/-Al/sub 2/O/sub 3/ > Pt/SiO/sub 2/. Two principal ir bands were observed on Pt - a high-frequency band between 2050 and 2080 cm/sup -1/ and a low-frequency band between 1780 and 1860 cm/sup -1/. Except for TiO/sub 2/-supported Pt, very similar behavior was observed, i.e., intense ir bands occurred which were nearly insensitive to temperature and the presence of H/sub 2/, and these catalysts exhibited strong bands under reaction conditions. In contrast, the Pt/TiO/sub 2/ (SMSI) catalyst showed almost no ir-detectable CO during reaction and, even more surprising, CO band intensities were also markedly reduced at 300 K by the presence of H/sub 2/. No obvious correlation was found between detectable CO species and specific activity; however, this study strongly infers that only a very small fraction of surface Pt atoms constitute active sites, and the higher activity occurring on the SMSI Pt/TiO/sub 2/ catalyst is attributed to a weakened CO-metal bond resulting in more competitive H/sub 2/ chemisorption and higher surface concentrations of hydrogen under reaction conditions.","","","Pennsylvania State Univ., University Park","","","United States","1983-01-01T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: J.
