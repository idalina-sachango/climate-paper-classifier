For practical applications, however, challenges such as material instability and the photocurrent hysteresis occurring in perovskite solar cells under light exposure need to be understood and addressed. While extensive investigations have suggested that ion migration is a plausible origin of these detrimental effects, detailed understanding of the ion migration pathways remains elusive. Here, we report the characterization of photo-induced ion migration in perovskites using in situ laser illumination inside a scanning electron microscope, coupled with secondary electron imaging, energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy and cathodoluminescence with varying primary electron energies. Using methylammonium lead iodide and formamidinium lead iodide as model systems, we observed photo-induced long-range migration of halide ions over hundreds of micrometers and elucidated the transport pathways of various ions both near the surface and inside the bulk of the samples, including a surprising finding of the vertical migration of lead ions. Our study provides insights into ion migration processes in perovskites that can aid perovskite material design and processing in future applications.</jats:p>","Nature Publishing Group","","Oak Ridge National Lab.

One prototypical example is hybrid magnonics in antiferromagnets with an easy-plane anisotropy that resembles a quantum-mechanically mixed two-level spin system through the coupling of acoustic and optical magnons. Generally, the coupling between these orthogonal modes is forbidden due to their opposite parity. Here we show that the Dzyaloshinskii–Moriya-Interaction (DMI), a chiral antisymmetric interaction that occurs in magnetic systems with low symmetry, can lift this restriction. We report that layered hybrid perovskite antiferromagnets with an interlayer DMI can lead to a strong intrinsic magnon-magnon coupling strength up to 0.24 GHz, which is four times greater than the dissipation rates of the acoustic/optical modes. Our work shows that the DMI in these hybrid antiferromagnets holds promise for leveraging magnon-magnon coupling by harnessing symmetry breaking in a highly tunable, solution-processable layered magnetic platform.</p>","Nature Publishing Group","","National Renewable Energy Lab.

"Determining circuit model parameters from operation data for PV system degradation analysis: $\mathrm{PVPRO}$","Li, Baojie; Karin, Todd; Meyers, Bennet E.; Chen, Xin; Jordan, Dirk C.; Hansen, Clifford W.; King, Bruce H.; Deceglie, Michael G.; Jain, Anubhav","14 SOLAR ENERGY; degradation; health monitoring; parameter estimation; photovoltaic; single-diode model","Physics-based circuit parameters like series and shunt resistance are essential to provide insights into the degradation status of photovoltaic (PV) arrays. However, calculating these parameters typically requires a full current-voltage characteristic (I-V curve), the acquisition of which involves specific measurement devices and costly methods. Thus, I-V curves of the PV system level are often not available. Here this paper proposes a methodology (PVPRO) to estimate these I-V curve parameters using only operation (string-level DC voltage and current) and weather data (irradiance and temperature). PVPRO first performs multi-stage data pre-processing to remove noisy data. Next, the time-series DC data are used to fit an equivalent circuit single-diode model (SDM) to estimate the circuit parameters by minimizing the differences between the measured and estimated values. In this way, the time evolutions of the SDM parameters are obtained. We evaluate PVPRO on synthetic datasets and find an excellent estimation of both SDM and the key I-V parameters (e.g., open-circuit voltage, short-circuit current, maximum power, etc.) with an average relative error of 0.55%. The performance, especially the extracted degradation rate of parameters, is robust to various measurement noises and the presence of faults. In addition, PVPRO is applied to a 271 kW PV field system. The relative error between the real and estimated operation voltage and current is less than 1%, suggesting that degradation trends are well captured. PVPRO represents a promising open-source tool to extract the time-series degradation trends of key PV parameters from routine operation data.","Elsevier","","National Renewable Energy Lab.

"A Gridded Solar Irradiance Ensemble Prediction System Based on WRF-Solar EPS and the Analog Ensemble","Alessandrini, Stefano; Kim, Ju-Hye; Jimenez, Pedro A.; Dudhia, Jimy; Yang, Jaemo; Sengupta, Manajit","47 OTHER INSTRUMENTATION; 14 SOLAR ENERGY; analog ensemble; ensemble calibration; rare events; solar irradiance ensemble forecasting","The WRF-Solar Ensemble Prediction System (WRF-Solar EPS) and a calibration method, the analog ensemble (AnEn), are used to generate calibrated gridded ensemble forecasts of solar irradiance over the contiguous United States (CONUS). Global horizontal irradiance (GHI) and direct normal irradiance (DNI) retrievals, based on geostationary satellites from the National Solar Radiation Database (NSRDB) are used for both calibrating and verifying the day-ahead GHI and DNI predictions (GDIP). A 10-member ensemble of WRF-Solar EPS is run in a re-forecast mode to generate day-ahead GDIP for three years. The AnEn is used to calibrate GDIP at each grid point independently using the NSRDB as the “ground truth”. Performance evaluations of deterministic and probabilistic attributes are carried out over the whole CONUS. The results demonstrate that using the AnEn calibrated ensemble forecast from WRF-Solar EPS contributes to improving the overall quality of the GHI predictions with respect to an AnEn calibrated system based only on the deterministic run of WRF-Solar. In fact, the calibrated WRF-Solar EPS’s mean exhibits a lower bias and RMSE than the calibrated deterministic WRF-Solar. Moreover, using the ensemble mean and spread as predictors for the AnEn allows a more effective calibration than using variables only from the deterministic runs. Finally, it has been shown that the recently introduced algorithm of correction for rare events is of paramount importance to obtain the lowest values of GHI from the calibrated ensemble (WRF-Solar EPS AnEn), qualitatively consistent with those observed from the NSRDB.","MDPI","","National Renewable Energy Lab.

We exercise an existing dispatch optimization model to estimate the profitability of a concentrating solar power plant by incorporating the sale of spinning reserves in the ancillary service market using the National Renewable Energy Laboratory's System Advisor Model to simulate operations within a 72-h rolling horizon framework. Assuming a price-taker approach with day-ahead energy and spinning reserve prices from both the California Independent System Operator and the Electricity Reliability Council of Texas, we find that selling spinning reserves in addition to electric energy increases plant profitability by up to 7% with perfect knowledge of day-ahead pricing and solar resource availability. Here, this finding suggests that spinning reserve markets provide significant value streams to concentrating solar power plants that can leverage thermal energy storage to offer reliable production in the short-to-medium term.","Elsevier","","National Renewable Energy Lab.

The transport properties and electrochemical activity of TIECs strongly depend on chemical composition and environmental conditions, such as operating temperature and gas environment. Here, this dependency is investigated in a large family of TIEC oxide perovskite materials via combinatorial experimental methods and multidimensional Bayesian analysis. In total, more than 2500 impedance spectra are collected at three temperatures under dry air and humid N2 atmospheres from 432 distinct Ba(Co,Fe,Zr,Y)O<sub>3-δ</sub> (BCFZY) compositions that were synthesized by pulsed laser deposition. This study provides insight on the trends governing electrochemical performance. Combinatorial experiments demonstrate that Co-rich compositions achieve the lowest overall polarization resistance under both dry air and humid N<sub>2</sub>, while Fe substitution may increase polarization resistance. Hierarchical Bayesian analysis indicates that the performance-limiting process depends on the chemical composition, measurement temperature, and atmospheric humidity. This work provides a map of electronic properties of materials in the BCFZY perovskite family under conditions that are relevant to their application as air electrodes for protonic ceramic fuel cells and electrolyzers, and demonstrates a unique approach to studying TIECs that combines combinatorial experiments and Bayesian analysis.","Royal Society of Chemistry (RSC)","","National Renewable Energy Lab.

Specifically, a faster-region-based convolutional neural network Resnet-50 feature pyramid network model was trained and validated on 862 manually labeled satellite images. Additionally, this model was used to perform object detection on satellite imagery, locating and classifying individual solar installations' mounting configuration and type. Model results showed a mean average precision score of 77.79%, with the model strongest at detecting fixed-tilt ground mount and fixed-tilt carport installations. The object detection model and its outputs have been incorporated into the panel-segmentation package's automated metadata extraction pipeline, which returns the mounting configuration and azimuth for individual solar arrays in satellite imagery.

Software tools can estimate or optimize the performance of a specific plant configuration under market and weather conditions of interest; the associated cost parameters and operating assumptions strongly influence estimates of plant performance and decisions regarding optimal sizing. We employ the National Renewable Energy Laboratory's Hybrid Optimization and Performance Platform, which incorporates optimal dispatch when evaluating plant performance, and investigate the sensitivity to weather and market conditions, operating limitations, and the presence of a capacity-based incentive. We demonstrate changes in plant performance and optimal sizing with respect to these inputs and discuss implications. Here results show that PV-with-battery designs are more profitable under our assumptions, but that designs including a concentrated solar power (CSP) system produce significantly greater annual energy; and that CSP-with-thermal energy storage designs maximizing the benefit-to-cost ratio have an input-dependent linear relationship between the CSP field solar multiple and the hours of storage as the project budget varies.","Elsevier","","National Renewable Energy Lab.

Dynamic windows reduce heating and cooling loads in buildings by passive heating in cold seasons and mitigating solar heat gain in hot seasons. Here, reduced energy consumption in highly glazed buildings in a mesoscopic building energy model is demonstrated when thermochromic windows are employed. Savings are realized across eight disparate climate zones of the United States. The model is used to determine ideal critical transition temperatures of 20-27.5 °C for thermochromic windows based on metal halide perovskite materials. Ideal transition temperatures are realized experimentally in composite metal halide perovskite films composed of perovskite crystals and an adjacent reservoir phase. The transition temperature is controlled by cointercalating methanol, instead of water, with methylammonium iodide and tailoring the hydrogen-bonding chemistry of the reservoir phase. Thermochromic windows based on metal halide perovskites represent a clear opportunity to mitigate the effects of energy-hungry buildings.","Wiley Blackwell (John Wiley & Sons)","","National Renewable Energy Lab.

"On the uncertainty of estimating photovoltaic soiling using nearby soiling data","Micheli, Leonardo; Muller, Matthew","14 SOLAR ENERGY; nearest neighbor; photovoltaic systems; soiling; spatial interpolation; solar energy","The accumulation of dust on the surface of photovoltaic modules can reduce their performance and affect the cost competitiveness of this technology. This phenomenon is known as soiling and can be mitigated through appropriate corrective and/or preventive actions. In order to maximize its effectiveness, it is important to plan the soiling mitigation strategy even before the PV system is operational. This is typically done through a nearest neighbor approach, by estimating soiling using data from the nearest operational photovoltaic system. This work focuses on understanding the uncertainty related to this practice. For this purpose, the semi-variance function is used to study the dissimilarity between the soiling losses of two locations in California depending on their distance. The results show that, when the soiling loss at a nearby system is used to estimate soiling of a site, the uncertainty can be approximated to increase linearly at a rate of 0.08-0.10%/km up to 60 or 80 km. After this distance, the use of a nearest neighbor approach is no longer justified, as it produces an uncertainty as big as the average soiling loss of the sites in the dataset used in this study. In some conditions, uncertainties > 0% are found also for sites located within 25 km, meaning that even close-by systems might soil differently.","Elsevier","","National Renewable Energy Lab.

"Design of Planarizing Growth Conditions on Unpolished and Faceted (100)-Oriented GaAs Substrates Using Hydride Vapor Phase Epitaxy","Braun, Anna K.; Schulte, Kevin L.; Simon, John; Ptak, Aaron J.; Packard, Corinne E.","36 MATERIALS SCIENCE; 14 SOLAR ENERGY; GaAs; HVPE; hydride vapor phase epitaxy; photovoltaic; planarizing overgrowth; PV; spalled surface","Here we performed a design of experiments (DoE) analysis to determine the effect of various growth parameters on in situ planarizing overgrowth of rough substrates using hydride vapor phase epitaxy (HVPE). We used two types of rough (100)-oriented GaAs substrates to compare the effect of the initial morphology on the epitaxial growth behavior: an irregular, as-cut surface resultant from cutting the wafer from a GaAs boule and a regularly faceted surface produced by controlled spalling. The DoE analysis identified trends in the overgrowth behavior with changing growth conditions, and we used these trends to design favorable planarization growth conditions for each surface type. These favorable conditions enabled full planarization of a spalled surface with >2.5 um facet height within 10.8 min of growth. The root mean squared (RMS) surface roughness of the resulting (100) surface was 24.5 nm over a 286 um x 215 um area. Our results show that planarization growth by HVPE is a promising technique to enable device growth directly on rough substrates, and the trends revealed through DoE analysis indicate a path toward further optimization of planarization growth conditions for as-cut and spalled surfaces.","American Chemical Society","","National Renewable Energy Lab.

To circumvent this outcome, we developed an ion-blocking layer consisting of single-layer graphene (SLG) deposited between the metal halide perovskite layers and demonstrated that it effectively blocks anion diffusion in a CsPbBr<sub>3</sub>/SLG/CsPbI<sub>3</sub> heterostructure. Spatially resolved elemental analysis and spectroscopic measurements demonstrate the halides do not diffuse across the interface, whereas control samples without the SLG show rapid homogenization of the halides and loss of the sharp interface. Ultraviolet photoelectron spectroscopy, DFT calculations, and transient absorbance spectroscopy indicate the SLG has little electronic impact on the individual semiconductors. In the CsPbBr<sub>3</sub>/SLG/CsPbI<sub>3</sub>, we find a type I band alignment that supports transfer of photogenerated carriers across the heterointerface. Light-emitting diodes (LEDs) show electroluminescence from both the CsPbBr<sub>3</sub> and CsPbI<sub>3</sub> layers with no evidence of ion diffusion during operation.

"A framework for comparing the energy production of photovoltaic modules using 2-, 3-, and 4-terminal tandem cells","McMahon, William E.; Geisz, John F.; Buencuerpo, Jeronimo; Warren, Emily L.","14 SOLAR ENERGY; 2T; 3T; 4T; current-matched; fixed standard spectrum; outdoor conditions; photovoltaic; PV; relative performance; tandem solar cell; voltage-matched","One of the design choices to be made when constructing photovoltaic modules from tandem solar cells is whether to use 2-, 3-, or 4-terminal tandem devices. Two-terminal (2T) cells are the simplest to interconnect, but for effective energy production the two subcells must be current-matched, which constrains the choice of materials for the component subcells. Three-terminal (3T) cells can be interconnected in voltage-matched configurations, which greatly increases the number of suitable subcell bandgap combinations, but with some additional cell interconnection complexity and losses. In principle, four-terminal (4T) cells provide the best power production, but in practice this will be mitigated by losses associated with the more complex interconnection requirements and shading losses necessitated by the need to laterally transport carriers between the cells. Many comparisons have been made between 2T and 4T configurations, mostly at the cell level. Here we provide a framework to assess the relative performance of 3T voltage-matched configurations relative to 2T and 4T approaches at the module level. We compare the energy production for both a fixed standard spectrum, and under variable outdoor conditions (accounting for spectrum, temperature, and location). The methods presented enable the comprehensive visualization and comparison of string-end losses, voltage matching ratios, and resistive and optical losses for tandems constructed out of any solar cell materials.","Royal Society of Chemistry (RSC)","","National Renewable Energy Lab.

We evaluate the use of intrinsic poly-Si for the region that isolates the p- and n-type fingers at the back side of IBC devices. To mitigate shunt across the isolation region between the doped p- and n-type fingers, we demonstrate self-aligned subtractive processing by etching the poly-Si in the isolation region using SF6 plasma followed by etching in a tetramethylammonium hydroxide (TMAH) solution. After removal of the poly-Si, the isolation region was passivated with SiN<sub>x</sub> and Al<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub>, which resulted in an 11.7% increase in the fill factor in a 19.8% efficient device. Furthermore, we evaluate the limitations of this device through Suns-V<sub>oc </sub>analysis and simulations using SunSolve and Quokka3 solar cell simulation software. Through Quokka3, we show that the most significant efficiency losses come from junction recombination current (J<sub>02</sub>) in the isolation region between doped fingers. We predict that the cell efficiency can be most improved with reduced J<sub>02</sub> through better isolation of heavily doped fingers by etching the isolation region deeper into the bulk or through enhanced surface chemical passivation in this region.","Elsevier","","National Renewable Energy Lab.

Herein, using electron paramagnetic resonance, we show that the defect responsible for light- and elevated-temperature-induced degradation (LeTID) is likely an Si dangling bond within an extended defect such as a vacancy agglomerate, with H atoms in its vicinity and likely O nearby. Our atomistic-level insights suggest that the defect responsible for LeTID can be mitigated by targeted engineering of the intrinsic defect populations by optimizing annealing routines prior to or during device fabrication and by controlling the amount of H injected in the Si bulk during cell processing. Mitigating LeTID through detailed knowledge of its atomic structure can help preserve the long-term efficiency of gigawatts of future worldwide installations of solar based on crystalline Si.","Elsevier","","National Renewable Energy Lab.

Alexander; Slette, Ingrid J.; Knapp, Alan K.","54 ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCES; 14 SOLAR ENERGY; agrivoltaic; dryland agriculture; dryland ecology; light response of photosynthesis; plant physiology","Agrivoltaic (AV) systems are designed to coproduce photovoltaic (PV) energy on lands simultaneously supporting agriculture (food/forage production). PV infrastructure in agroecosystems alters resources critical for plant growth, and water-limited agroecosystems such as grasslands are likely to be particularly sensitive to the unique spatial and temporal patterns of incident sunlight and soil water inherent within AV systems. However, the impact of resource alteration on forage production, the primary ecosystem service from managed grasslands, is poorly resolved. Here, we evaluated seasonal patterns of soil moisture (SM) and diurnal variation in incident sunlight (photosynthetic photon flux density [PPFD]) in a single-axis-tracking AV system established in a formerly managed semiarid C<sub>3</sub> grassland in Colorado. Our goals were to (1) quantify dynamic patterns of PPFD and SM within a 1.2 MW PV array in a perennial grassland, and (2) determine how aboveground net primary production (ANPP) and photosynthetic parameters responded to the resource patterns created by the PV array. We hypothesized that spatial variability in ANPP would be strongly related to SM patterns, typical of most grasslands. We measured significant reductions in ANPP directly beneath PV panels, where SM and PPFD were both low. However, in locations with significantly increased SM from the shedding and redistribution of precipitation by PV panels, ANPP was not increased. Instead, ANPP was greatest in locations where plants were shaded in the afternoon but received high levels of PPFD in the morning hours, when air temperatures and vapor pressure deficits were relatively low. Thus, contrary to expectations, we found relatively weak relationships between SM and ANPP despite significant spatial variability in both. Further, there was little evidence that light-saturated photosynthesis (A<sub>sat</sub>) and quantum yield of CO<sub>2</sub> assimilation (ΦCO<sub>2</sub>) differed for plants growing directly beneath (lowest PPFD) versus between (highest PPFD) PV panels. Overall, the AV system established in this semiarid managed grassland did not alter patterns of ANPP in ways predictable from past studies of controls of ANPP in open grasslands. However, our results suggest that the diurnal timing of low versus high periods of PPFD incident on plants is an important determinant of productivity patterns in grasslands.","Wiley Blackwell (John Wiley & Sons)","","National Renewable Energy Lab.

However, issues with Br–I phase segregation under solar cell operational conditions (such as light and heat) limit the device voltage and operational stability. This challenge is often exacerbated by the ready defect formation associated with the rapid crystallization of Br-rich perovskite chemistry with antisolvent processes. We combined the rapid Br crystallization with a gentle gas-quench method to prepare highly textured columnar 1.75–electron volt Br–I mixed WBG perovskite films with reduced defect density. Here, with this approach, we obtained 1.75–electron volt WBG PSCs with greater than 20% power conversion efficiency, approximately 1.33-volt open-circuit voltage (V<sub>oc</sub>), and excellent operational stability (less than 5% degradation over 1100 hours of operation under 1.2 sun at 65°C).

"The cost savings potential of controlling solar thermal collectors with storage for time-of-use electricity rates","Parker, Walter; Odukomaiya, Adewale; Thornton, Jeff; Woods, Jason","14 SOLAR ENERGY; control; solar thermal collectors; thermal storage; time-of-use electricity rates","Homes and commercial buildings account for roughly 40% of U.S. energy consumption. A significant portion of this energy consumption, and therefore utility cost, comes from domestic hot-water use. Solar collectors such as flat plate collectors, evacuated tubes, and combined photovoltaic/thermal panels, are renewable options that collect thermal energy and could help reduce utility costs. Hot water is generated by pumping a working fluid through the solar collector, where the fluid captures thermal energy via absorbed solar radiation incident on the collector surface. The collection of heat coincides with the availability of solar radiation, but the best time to use this thermal energy depends on the utility rate at a given time, which often changes throughout the day. In this work, we implement and simulate a control strategy using Transient System Simulation Tool (TRNSYS) that reduces utility costs by controlling when the system stores and uses thermal energy based on solar availability and time-of-use electricity rates. Our modeled results show that the control strategy can reduce utility costs associated with using hot water between 3% and 30%. Here, we also show how the on-peak utility rates, the size and type of the solar collectors, and the location's climate impact the results.","Elsevier","","National Renewable Energy Lab.

In all cases, we observed similar device performance correlations to the PbI<sub>2</sub> reagent source across the different processing recipes and architectures. We then employed a suite of analytical characterization techniques to determine the identity and concentration of impurities within the PbI<sub>2</sub> reagents that affected the device performance trends. Many impurities were observed; some remain unidentified, but it was possible to single out acetate (OAc) and potassium (K) as key species displaying the largest variation in concentrations among the as-received PbI<sub>2</sub>. Acetate was identified as a detrimental impurity, while K impurities may be advantageous as suggested by the previous literature on alkali cation additives. A simple aqueous recrystallization successfully decreased the concentration of many impurities, and the results from devices fabricated from recrystallized PbI<sub>2</sub> reagents are interpreted in terms of their new impurity profiles.

The crystallization and photoelectric properties of LD perovskite are well illustrated. The reduction in the annealing time will dramatically increase the productivity of PSCs. The PSCs based on rapidly annealed LD perovskite thin films exhibit excellent stability, with only 12% loss of PCE after 1000 h storage at 85 °C and 40-70% relative humidity.","Elsevier","","National Renewable Energy Lab.

"Improvement of aerosol optical depth data for localized solar resource assessment","Lin, Chin-An; Zhang, Yimin; Heath, Garvin; Henze, Daven K.; Sengupta, Manajit; Lu, Cheng-Hsuan","14 SOLAR ENERGY; aerosol optical depth; direct normal irradiance; solar irradiance; solar resource assessment","Solar irradiance, especially for direct normal irradiance (DNI), is sensitive to the atmospheric aerosols, which can strongly extinguish DNI over areas with elevated aerosol loadings. The National Solar Radiation Database (NSRDB), developed by the National Renewable Energy Laboratory (NREL), uses AOD from MERRA-2 reanalysis and is further downscaled from 0.5° to 2-km based on elevation. However, the elevation-based downscaling may not accurately represent AOD, especially over the areas with large AOD gradients. This study examined whether the 1-km MODIS MAIAC satellite-retrieved AOD product can better represent the AOD distribution and be used to improve solar irradiance assessment. We focused on areas with relatively high AOD over North America (California, and New York City, US, and Mexico City in Mexico, in particular). The evaluation of MAIAC AOD and MERRA-2 AOD against ground-truth AERONET AOD shows that MAIAC AOD exhibits smaller RMSE by about 0.05 and higher correlation coefficient by 0.1-0.6 than MERRA-2 AOD. In addition, MERRA-2 AOD shows larger negative bias. The simulated DNI using MAIAC AOD (DNIMAIAC) and using MERRA-2 AOD (DNINSRDB) were evaluated with DNI observations. The results show the performance of DNIMAIAC is better than that of DNINSRDB with smaller RMSE by 0.5-1.5%, smaller positive mean bias by 0.8-3.1% and comparable correlation for the 3 sites analyzed. Overall, 1-km MAIAC AOD shows higher accuracy than 2-km elevation-based MERRA-2 AOD, leading to better performance of the simulated DNI using MAIAC AOD. Therefore, 1-km MAIAC AOD can be used to improve the accuracy of solar resource assessment.","Elsevier","","National Renewable Energy Lab.

As a result, models offering precise simulation in operations often acquire individual cloud transmittance or reflectance from a lookup table precomputed for practicable scenarios. To further expedite the computation of global horizontal irradiance and to reduce the storage requirements, the Fast All-sky Radiation Model for Solar applications (FARMS) parameterized the lookup table using elementary functions with specified coefficients. This study extends FARMS direct normal irradiance (DNI) computation by utilizing hyperbolic tangent functions and various polynomial functions to parameterize the cloud transmittance for scattered solar radiation in the circumsolar region. The parameterization is implemented in FARMS with DNI (FARMS-DNI) and accounts for the circumsolar radiation when assessing or forecasting DNI. The evaluation, with long-term observations at the National Renewable Energy Laboratory's, Solar Radiation Research Laboratory, and the Atmospheric Radiation Measurement, Southern Great Plains, Central Facility, shows that the parameterized DNIs are virtually identical with those computed by coupling FARMS-DNI to a lookup table of cloud transmittance. This parameterization has diverse applications in radiative transfer models and numerical weather prediction models used to assess or forecast direct solar radiation.","American Institute of Physics (AIP)","ORNL","Oak Ridge National Lab.

Maintaining decades-long high-energy production is often an under-recognized opportunity in meeting cost goals because component lifetimes are not fully quantified at the time of manufacture. Whereas certain standardized tests minimize risk of early failure, there is little guidance to quantitatively predict degradation (or lack thereof) over decades, based on accelerated tests. In this article, we move toward bridging the understanding between indoor accelerated tests and outdoor performance data, with the goal of predicting energy yield with enough accuracy to inform financial decisions. Light- and elevated temperature-induced degradation (LETID) in p-type Si modules is analyzed in terms of impact on long-term module performance and thus LCOE. A method to predict the progression of LETID, using fixed kinetic constants and a numerical solution to the basic reaction rate equations, is detailed. Predictions are compared against both published data and that new to this study. These data include both indoor accelerated tests and fielded modules. We use the results in financial models to derive LCOE of modules in different climates with varying amounts of LETID, including uncertainty. Cost models based on the predictions indicate that LETID has a significant and climate-dependent impact on LCOE. Finally, we show that - even given the uncertainties identified in the study - these financial calculations can provide useful guidance to quantify risk based on accelerated test results. The analysis serves as an example of developing a predictive approach to PV reliability using physics of failure.","Materials Research Society","","National Renewable Energy Lab.

However, incommensurate interfaces are notoriously defective and rarely benefit from first-principles predictions, because no explicit atomic-structure models exist. Here, we adopt a bulk crystal structure prediction method to the interface geometry and apply it to SnO <sub>2</sub> /CdTe heterojunctions without and with the addition of CdCl <sub>2</sub> , a ubiquitous and beneficial, but abstruse processing step in CdTe photovoltaics. Whereas the direct SnO <sub>2</sub> /CdTe interface is highly defective, we discover a unique two-dimensional CdCl <sub>2</sub> interphase, unrelated to the respective bulk structure. It facilitates a seamless transition from the rutile to zincblende lattices and removes defect-states from the interface bandgap. Implementing the predicted interface electronic structure in device simulations, we demonstrate the theoretical feasibility of bufferless oxide-CdTe heterojunction solar cells approaching the Shockley–Queisser limit. Our results highlight the broader potential of designing atomically thin interlayers to enable defect-free incommensurate interfaces. </p>","American Institute of Physics (AIP)","","National Renewable Energy Lab.

"Fast Quasi-Static Time-Series Simulation for Accurate PV Inverter Semiconductor Fatigue Analysis with a Long-Term Solar Profile","Liu, Yunting; Tolbert, Leon M.; Kritprajun, Paychuda; Dong, Jiaojiao; Zhu, Lin; Ollis, Thomas Ben; Schneider, Kevin P.; Prabakar, Kumaraguru","24 POWER TRANSMISSION AND DISTRIBUTION; 14 SOLAR ENERGY; aging; fatigue; inverters; solar power generation; systems simulation","Power system simulations with long-term data typically have large time steps, varying from one second to a few minutes. However, for PV inverter semiconductors in grid-connected applications, the minimum thermal stress cycle occurs over the fundamental grid frequency (50 or 60 Hz). This requires the time step of the fatigue simulation to be approximately 100 μs. This small time step requires long computation times to process yearly power production profiles. In this paper, we propose a fast fatigue simulation for inverter semiconductors using the quasi-static time-series simulation concept. The proposed simulation calculates the steady state of the semiconductor junction temperature using a fast Fourier transform. The small thermal cycling during a switching period and even over the fundamental waveform is disregarded to further accelerate the simulation speed. The resulting time step of the fatigue simulation is 15 min, which is consistent with the solar dataset. The error of the proposed simulation is 0.16% compared to the fatigue simulation results using the complete thermal stress profile. The error of the proposed method is significantly less than the conventional averaged thermal profile. A PV inverter that responds to a transactive energy system is simulated to demonstrate the use of the proposed fatigue simulation. The proposed simulation has the potential to cosimulate with system-level simulation tools that also adopt the quasi-static time-series concept.","MDPI","","National Renewable Energy Lab.

Here, we characterize convective cooling in diverse PV array designs, capturing combined effects of spatial and atmospheric variation on panel temperature and production. Parameters, including row spacing, panel inclination, module height, and wind velocity, are explored through wind tunnel experiments, high-resolution numerical simulations, and operating field data. A length scale based on fractal lacunarity encapsulates all aspects of arrangement (angle, height, etc.) in a single value. When applied to the Reynolds number Re within the canonical Nusselt number heat transfer correlation, lacunarity reveals a relationship between convection and farm-specific geometry. This correlation can be applied to existing and forthcoming array designs to optimize convective cooling, ultimately increasing production and PV cell life.","American Institute of Physics (AIP)","","National Renewable Energy Lab.

WRF-Solar EPS has been developed by introducing stochastic perturbations into the most relevant physical variables for solar irradiance predictions. In this study, we comprehensively discuss the impact of the stochastic perturbations of WRF-Solar EPS on solar irradiance forecasting compared to a deterministic WRF-Solar prediction (WRF-Solar DET), a stochastic ensemble using the stochastic kinetic energy backscatter scheme (SKEBS), and a WRF-Solar multi-physics ensemble (WRF-Solar PHYS). The performances of the four forecasts are evaluated using irradiance retrievals from the National Solar Radiation Database (NSRDB) over the contiguous United States. We focus on the predictability of the day-ahead solar irradiance forecasts during the year of 2018. The results show that the ensemble forecasts improve the quality of the forecasts, compared to the deterministic prediction system, by accounting for the uncertainty derived by the ensemble members. However, the three ensemble systems are under-dispersive, producing unreliable and overconfident forecasts due to a lack of calibration. In particular, WRF-Solar EPS produces less optically thick clouds than the other forecasts, which explains the larger positive bias in WRF-Solar EPS (31.7 W/m<sup>2</sup>) than in the other models (22.7–23.6 W/m<sup>2</sup>). This study confirms that the WRF-Solar EPS reduced the forecast error by 7.5% in terms of the mean absolute error (MAE) compared to WRF-Solar DET, and provides in-depth comparisons of forecast abilities with the conventional scientific probabilistic approaches (i.e., SKEBS and a multi-physics ensemble). Guidelines for improving the performance of WRF-Solar EPS in the future are provided.","MDPI","","National Renewable Energy Lab.

However, a comprehensive understanding of where and how these window technologies can be installed to enable optimal energy savings under different climate conditions remains limited.

Quasi-Fermi level splitting (QFLS) measurements reveal V<sub>OC</sub>-limiting recombination at the electron transport layer (ETL) contact. This, we find, stems from inhomogeneous surface potential and poor perovskite-ETL energetic alignment. Common monoammonium surface treatments fail to address this; instead we introduce diammonium molecules to modify the perovskite surface states and achieve a more uniform spatial distribution of surface potential. Using 1,3-propane diammonium (PDA), QFLS increases by 90 meV, enabling 1.79 eV PSCs with a certified 1.33 V V<sub>OC</sub>, and > 19% power conversion efficiency (PCE).

"Optimal interconnection of three-terminal tandem solar cells","Schulte‐Huxel, Henning; Witteck, Robert; Blankemeyer, Susanne; Köntges, Marc","14 SOLAR ENERGY; photovoltaic; tandem solar cell; tandem solar module; three terminal","Three-terminal (3T) tandem solar cells require an adapted module integration scheme in order to explore their full efficiency potential. The three terminals allow to extract the power of the top and bottom cell separately. In a cell string, the wide bandgap top cells are interconnected in parallel to multiple bottom cells resulting in a parallel/series interconnection. This interconnection scheme affects the operation of the subcells, the resulting current path between the subcells, the layout of the cell interconnects, and the system level. Here, we analyze by simulations and experiments the aspects of the module integration of series- and reverse-connected 3T cells with their practical impact on module processes and performance as well as the effect of varying voltage ratios on the string-end losses. If the subcells are connected in series, the module integration requires insulation layers and significantly longer interconnects compared to devices with reverse-connected subcells. Tandem devices with a reverse connection and a voltage ratio between top and bottom cell of 2:1 allow a lean interconnection design and low integration losses. Here, we present an approach for the integration of bypass diodes for the protection against shading effects that allow to minimize string-end and shading losses for a system of modules featuring 3T cells.","Wiley","","National Renewable Energy Lab.

We model the flow and heat transfer of each solar farm using high-resolution large-eddy simulations.

The bandgap can be beneficially reduced using many layers of thin, strain-balanced GaInAs in a superlattice or quantum well device, but achieving excellent carrier collection without increased recombination has proven challenging. Here, we develop and demonstrate high performance, optically thick GaInAs/GaAsP strain-balanced solar cells. Excellent material quality is achieved in thick superlattices by using growth conditions that limit progressive thickness and composition fluctuations. Bandgap-voltage offsets as low as 0.31 V are shown in superlattice cells using thin, highly strained GaP barriers. Optically thick superlattice cells with over 2500 nm of total GaInAs in the depletion region are developed, enabling 3.8 mA/cm <sup>2</sup> of extra photocurrent beyond the GaAs band edge under the AM0 space spectrum. Optimized superlattice solar cells are incorporated into two-junction devices that achieve 29.2% efficiency under the AM0 space spectrum due to their improved bandgap combination and high subcell voltages. </p>","American Institute of Physics (AIP)","","National Renewable Energy Lab.

Both 0.5-Hz and 3-Hz oscillations become visible at certain conditions. The phenomenon is further explained by use of a feedback system consisting of the plant-level droop control and the effect of reactive power or var injection on voltage. The main components of the block diagram are obtained via frequency scan measurements. The analysis offers an understanding of the main contributors and other influencing factors of the 3-Hz and 0.5-Hz modes.

Herein, we show that Ga-doped Cz Si remains paramagnetic upon carrier injection. This suggests that either the shallow hole traps that are formed in B-doped Cz Si are absent in Ga-doped Cz Si, or the negative-U centers in Ga-doped Cz Si do not transform into a recombination-active configuration, because the shallow acceptor trap state is shallower than the Ga acceptor level in the forbidden gap.

We use distinct chirality s-SWCNTs to separate the site and direction of light absorption from those of power generation. Using different bandgap s-SWCNTs, we implement an energy funnel in dual-gated p-n diodes. The device captures photons from multiple regions of the solar spectrum and funnels photogenerated excitons to the smallest bandgap s-SWCNT layer, where they become free carriers. We demonstrate an increase in the photoresponse by adding more s-SWCNT layers of different bandgaps without a corresponding deleterious increase in the dark leakage current.","American Chemical Society","","National Renewable Energy Lab.

In particular, for 2D perovskites exhibiting interlayer sensitized triplet emission from their organic cations, the final molecular emission profiles are often influenced by intermolecular interactions between neighboring chromophores. Embedding these chromophores within an inert host cation is an emerging strategy for controlling the degree of intermolecular coupling and thereby influencing the formation of isolated monomer versus multimolecular states. In this work, we demonstrate tunable broadband emission from 2D perovskites containing varying amounts of a naphthalene chromophore mixed with hexylammonium cations. Across the series of perovskites, emission from free or self-trapped excitons and naphthalene triplet monomers or excimers contributes to wide color tunability from green to yellow to orange.

While there have been numerous approaches to PV temperature modeling based on both the steady-state and transient thermal assumptions, there have been few attempts to account for changing convective cooling on PV module surfaces resulting from changes in the PV system layout. Changes in system row spacing, in particular, can have a meaningful impact on module electrical efficiency and subsequent economic performance, even when considering additional costs from the changes in row spacing. Using a heat transfer approach based on the spatial definition of a PV array, technoeconomic analyses of different plant configurations are presented here that show an improved system levelized cost of energy (LCOE) for fixed-tilt PV systems when increasing system row spacing. These LCOE improvements have been found to be as high as 2.15% in climates characterized by low ambient temperatures and higher average annual wind speeds in U.S. climates. While the LCOE improvements are primarily driven by incident irradiance changes for altered row spacing, the waterfall analysis of the different components of changing system LCOE show that modifications in the heat transfer dynamics have a 0.5% contribution to the LCOE reduction for the largest LCOE, compared with a 3.3% reduction from irradiance changes.","Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers","","National Renewable Energy Lab.

These include operator situation awareness, resource risk hedging, reserves procurement, definition of contingencies, and explicit stochastic optimization. We review these approaches, and then provide a case study in which a method for using probabilistic solar forecasts to define needs for reserves is developed and evaluated. The case study has three parts. First, we describe building blocks for enhancing the Watt-Sun solar forecasting system to produce probabilistic irradiance and power forecasts. Second, relationships between Watt-Sun forecasts for multiple sites in California and the system's need for flexible ramp capability (flexiramp) are defined by machine learning and statistical methods. Third, the performance of present methods to defining flexiramp requirements, which are not conditioned on weather and renewables forecasts, is compared with that of probabilistic solar forecast-based requirements, using a multi-timescale production costing model with an 1820-bus representation of the WECC power system. Significant potential savings in fuel and flexiramp procurement costs from using solar-informed reserve requirements are found.","IEEE","","National Renewable Energy Lab.

The following fabrication methods are discussed in the article: PDBC fabrication procedures for spin-on dielectrics and commonly evaporated dielectrics to form the spacer layer; methods to selectively etch a parasitically absorbing back contact layer using metal point contacts as an etch mask; methods incorporating a dielectric etch through different process techniques such as reactive ion and wet etching.","Elsevier","","National Renewable Energy Lab.

"Evaluation of bifacial module technologies with combined–accelerated stress testing","Hacke, Peter; Kumar, Akash; Terwilliger, Kent; Ndione, Paul; Spataru, Sergiu; Pavgi, Ashwini; Choudhury, Kaushik Roy; Tamizhmani, Govindasamy","14 SOLAR ENERGY; bifacial; combined-accelerated stress testing; degradation; light-induced degradation; photovoltaic modules; potential-induced degradation; reliability; silicon solar cells","In view of the increasing interest and market share of bifacial cells and modules, suitable substrates such as glass and transparent backsheets along with ethylene vinyl acetate (EVA) and polyolefin elastomer (POE) encapsulants were examined in combined-accelerated stress testing (C-AST) to evaluate and compare degradation modes. Testing with both monofacial and bifacial cells, we found glass-glass modules with monofacial cells led to greater grid finger breakage than those with polymeric backsheets. Furthermore, this is attributed to previous X-ray topography and modeling work showing higher stress in cells and interconnections in glass-glass modules than glass-backsheet modules. Consistent with the objectives of C-AST, which stresses modules at levels corresponding to the limits seen in the natural environment, we observed the UV-fluorescence signatures of modules tested in C-AST (considering the degradation associated with developing chromophores, moisture penetration and photobleaching effects) to be like those in fielded modules, more so than other chamber stress testing implemented for comparison. We found light-induced degradation (LID) in module types with regenerated (inactive) cells with C-AST, suggesting the possibility of LID destabilization in some field conditions. We could also distinguish potential-induced degradation (PID) on the back of the bifacial passivated emitter and rear cells (PERC) in C-AST. Confirming with ex-situ tests, we found polarization-type PID most prevalent in glass-glass modules with EVA as would be anticipated considering the greater leakage current through such module encapsulation. Unlike PID tests performed in the dark, which can lead to false positive PID test results, field-representative illumination is experienced by the modules on the front and back side while –1200 V system voltage is applied in C-AST, supporting the conclusion that this module type with glass-glass construction would be susceptible to PID in the field.","Wiley","","National Renewable Energy Lab.

One challenge to success is that, to date, similar materials and devices measured in different labs or by different operators lead to quantitatively different results, due to the lack of accepted standard operating procedures and established protocols for PEC efficiency testing. With the aim of disseminating good practices within the PEC community, we provide a vetted protocol that describes how to prepare integrated components and accurately measure their solar-to-hydrogen (STH) efficiency (η<sub>STH</sub>). This protocol provides details on electrode fabrication, η<sub>STH</sub> test device assembly, light source calibration, hydrogen evolution measurement, and initial material qualification by photocurrent measurements under monochromatic and broadband illumination. Common pitfalls in translating experimental results from any lab to an accurate STH efficiency under an AM1.5G reference spectrum are discussed. A III–V tandem photocathode is used to exemplify the process, though with small modifications, the protocol can be applied to photoanodes as well. Dissemination of PEC best practices will help those approaching the field and provide guidance for comparing the results obtained at different lab sites by different groups.","Frontiers Research Foundation","","National Renewable Energy Lab.

"Future-proofing photovoltaics module reliability through a unifying predictive modeling framework","Springer, Martin; Jordan, Dirk C.; Barnes, Teresa M.","14 SOLAR ENERGY; long-term degradation; modeling framework; photovoltaics; predictive modeling; reliablity; service life","Solar energy, especially photovoltaics (PV), plays a significant role in the global energy transition required for decarbonization. Technological advancements in increasing efficiencies coupled with cost reductions through economies of scale made PV a cost-competitive energy source set to exceed the milestone of 1 TW globally deployed capacity in 2022. However, ongoing downward price pressure coupled with increasing service life expectations creates tremendous challenges for reliability engineers in ensuring the safe and reliable operation of PV modules and systems over the anticipated service life. Today's reliability research efforts aim for module lifetimes of up to 50 years. Still, our current tools fall short in accurately assessing degradation mechanisms and failure modes over such extended periods. We argue that the well-established PV reliability learning cycle needs to be accelerated to keep up with the rapid technological advancements and high expectations that are put on PV and its role in the global energy transition. In this article, we explore the evolution of the PV reliability learning cycle and highlight the significance that predictive modeling capabilities will have on future PV module reliability. We propose creating a unifying modeling framework - which once established will enable the holistic assessment of PV module reliability, accelerate the PV reliability learning cycle, and bring us closer to quantitative service life predictions of PV modules.","Wiley","","National Renewable Energy Lab.

In this work, we use electron microscopy and elemental mapping to directly measure the halide redistribution in mixed-halide perovskite solar cells with quasi-ion-impermeable contact layers under different bias polarities to find iodide and bromide accumulation at the cathode and anode, respectively. This is consistent with a mechanism based on preferential iodide oxidation at the anode, leading to unbalanced I$^{+}_{i}$, I$^{-}_{X}$, and Br$^{-}_{X}$ fluxes. Importantly, switching the anode from ""inert"" Au to ""active"" Ag prevents segregation because Ag oxidation precludes the oxidation of lattice iodide, which suggests employing redox-active additives as a general strategy to suppress halide segregation. Finally, these results show that halide perovskite devices operate as solid-state electrochemical cells when threshold voltages are exceeded, providing fresh insight to understand the impacts of voltage bias on halide perovskite devices.","American Chemical Society (ACS)","","National Renewable Energy Lab.

We compare the device performance of solar cells passivated with AlInP versus control cells passivated with GaInP, which has already enabled near-unity carrier collection in GaAs solar cells. 1J devices passivated with either AlInP or GaInP have an identical open-circuit voltage (V<sub>OC</sub>) of 1.06 V and long-wavelength current collection near 95%, indicating that both window materials provide a similar degree of passivation. Adding AlInP passivation to each solar cell structure improves the current collection by 1.3 and 1 mA/cm<sup>2</sup> for the 1J and 2J, respectively. The AlInP also results in a top cell V<sub>OC</sub> boost of ~40 mV relative to a tandem device passivated only by a thin, highly doped GaInP emitter. Secondary-ion mass spectrometry measurements indicate that although O and Si both incorporate in the AlInP window, they do not appear in the subsequently grown absorber layers and do not impact its ability to passivate the front surface. We expect that these achievements, along with continued optimization, will enable parity of hydride vapor-phase epitaxy (HVPE)-grown device efficiencies with state-of-the-art devices grown by other epitaxial methods in the near future.","Wiley","","National Renewable Energy Lab.

We provide details on the observation of this mechanism at two additional sites not described in the original article. In a second case study, we found that two different types of cell had been used, and that they could be distinguished by their back contact. Cells with uniform back contacts suffered from light and elevated temperature induced degradation (LeTID), while those with local back contacts did not.

Our results from both sites underscore that variations in BOM, even among modules of the same make and model can lead to reliability challenges.","IEEE","","National Renewable Energy Lab.

Scanning spreading resistance microscopy imaging with nanometer (nm) scale spatial resolution revealed that the number of point or small-area electrical contacts decreased substantially in a degraded cell compared to an unaffected cell, demonstrating the root cause of Rs degradation. The decrease in electrical contacts is likely caused by a structural change - the Ag particles in contact with the Si cell (or via a nm-thickness tunneling glass layer) aggregate into bulk Ag, and a highly resistive glass frit forms a belt shape at the Ag/Si interface. This resistive belt, with a thickness of ~1 um, blocks the current conduction from the cell emitter to the Ag grid. Our microscopy results help to unravel unambiguously the degradation mechanism and demonstrate an example of the multiscale characterization approach for understanding degradation in field-weathered PV module.","IEEE","","National Renewable Energy Lab.

The purpose of this paper is to systematically synthesize the potential ecosystem services of agrivoltaics and summarize how these development strategies could address several United Nations Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs). Our review will focus on four broad potential ecosystem services of agrivoltaics: (1) energy and economic benefits; (2) agricultural provisioning services of food production and animal husbandry; (3) biodiversity conservation; and (4) regulating ecosystem services such as carbon sequestration and water and soil conservation.

This unprecedented global scale-up will stress existing PV supply chains with increased material and energy demands. By 2050, 1.75 TW of PV in the US cumulatively demands 97 million metric tonnes of virgin material and creates 8 million metric tonnes of life cycle waste. This analysis leverages the PV in Circular Economy tool (PV ICE) to evaluate two circular economy approaches, lifetime extension and closed-loop recycling, on their ability to reduce virgin material demands and life cycle wastes while meeting capacity goals. Modules with 50-year lifetimes can reduce virgin material demand by 3% through reduced deployment. Modules with 15-year lifetimes require an additional 1.2 TW of replacement modules to maintain capacity, increasing virgin material demand and waste unless >90% of module mass is closed-loop recycled. Currently, no PV technology is more than 90% closed-loop recycled.

"<strong>AlScO<sub>3</sub> perovskite—An ~8 eV bandgap oxide predicted to exhibit low small hole polaron ionization energies and <em>p</em>-type conductivity at elevated temperatures</strong>","Lee, Cheng-Wei; Gorai, Prashun; Garrity, Emily; Zakutayev, Andriy; Stevanović, Vladan","14 SOLAR ENERGY; 71 CLASSICAL AND QUANTUM MECHANICS, GENERAL PHYSICS; density functional theory; doping; polaron; power electronics; semiconductor; ultrawide band gap","<p> We investigate electronic structure and dopability of an ultrawide bandgap (UWBG) AlScO <sub>3</sub> perovskite, a known high-pressure and long-lived metastable oxide. From first-principles electronic structure calculations, HSE06(+G <sub>0</sub> W <sub>0</sub> ), we find this material to exhibit an indirect bandgap of around 8.0 eV. Defect calculations point to cation and oxygen vacancies as the dominant intrinsic point defects limiting extrinsic doping. While acceptor behaving Al and Sc vacancies prevent n-type doping, oxygen vacancies permit the Fermi energy to reach ∼0.3 eV above the valence band maximum, rendering AlScO <sub>3</sub> p-type dopable. Furthermore, we find that both Mg and Zn could serve as extrinsic p-type dopants. Specifically, Mg is predicted to have achievable net acceptor concentrations of ∼10 <sup>17</sup> cm <sup>−3</sup> with ionization energy of bound small hole polarons of ∼0.49 eV and free ones below 0.1 eV. These values place AlScO <sub>3</sub> among the UWBG oxides with lowest bound small hole polaron ionization energies, which, as we find, is likely due to large ionic dielectric constant that correlates well with low hole polaron ionization energies across various UWBG oxides. </p>","American Institute of Physics (AIP)","","National Renewable Energy Lab.

A utility provider experienced a ~30% failure rate in their power transfer chain, originally attributed to branch connectors. Field-failed specimen assemblies were, therefore, examined, consisting of cable connector, branch connector, and discrete fuse components. In this study, unused field-vintage specimens are examined using a benchtop prototype fixture to identify the most influential environmental stressors on BoS components as well as the effect of external mechanical perturbation. The prototype fixture was used to develop a perturbation capability for future use in the combined-accelerated stress testing chamber. The benchtop experiments were also used to develop the in-situ data acquisition of specimen current, voltage, and temperature. A significant increase in operating temperature (~100 °C from ~40 °C) and a different failure mode (arcing at the metal pins rather than overheating of the fuse filament) were observed promptly once periodic mechanical perturbation was applied. The current at failure was decreased from 35 A (measured for static specimens, with failure occurring in the fuses) to 15 A (for tests with mechanical perturbation, with failure at the male/female metal pin connection). After initial examination using X-ray computed tomography, the external plastic was machined away from failed specimens to allow for failure analysis, including the extraction of the internal convolute springs for morphological examination (optical and electron microscopy). Chemical composition analysis included energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy, differential scanning calorimetry, and Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy.","IEEE","","National Renewable Energy Lab.

However, the power conversion efficiency (PCE) of p-i-n PSCs falls behind n-i-p (or normal) structure counterparts. This large performance gap could undermine efforts to adopt p-i-n architectures, despite their other advantages. Given the remarkable advances in perovskite bulk materials optimization over the past decade, interface engineering has become the most important strategy to push PSC performance to its limit. Here, we report a reactive surface engineering approach based on a simple post-growth treatment of 3-(Aminomethyl)pyridine (3-APy) on top of a perovskite thin film. First, the 3-APy molecule selectively reacts with surface FA+, reducing perovskite surface roughness and surface potential fluctuations associated with surface steps/terraces. Second, the reaction product on the perovskite surface decreases the formation energy of charged iodine-vacancies, leading to effective n-type doping with a reduced work function in the surface region. With this reactive surface engineering, the resulting p-i-n PSCs obtained a PCE over 25%, along with retaining 87% of the initial PCE after over 2400 h of one-sun operation at about 55 degrees C in air.","Nature Publishing Group","","National Renewable Energy Lab.

However, increasing the canopy height of these systems promotes surface heat transfer and boosts production. This work represents the first wind tunnel experiments to explore this concept in terms of array flow behavior and relative convective heat transfer, comparing model solar arrays of varied height arrangements - a nominal height, extended height, and a staggered height configuration. Analyses of surface thermocouple data show average Nusselt number (Nu) to increase with array elevation, where panel convection at double height improved up to 1.88 times that of the nominal case. This behavior is an effect of sub-array entrainment of high velocity flow and panel interactions as evidenced through flow statistics and mean kinetic energy budgets on particle image velocimetry (PIV) data. The staggered height arrangement encourages faster sub-panel flow than in the nominal array. Despite sub-array blockage due to the lower panel interaction, heat shedding at panel surfaces promotes improvements on over 1.3 times that of the nominal height case.","Elsevier","","National Renewable Energy Lab.

This work seeks to provide a better understanding of the changes in material properties that lead to crack formation and find appropriate accelerated tests to replicate them. The PVDF-based backsheet outer layer can have a different structure and composition, and is often blended with a poly(methyl methacrylate) (PMMA) polymer. We observed depletion of PMMA upon aging with sequential (MAST) and combined (C-AST) accelerated stress testing. In field-aged samples from Arizona and India, where PVDF crystallizes in its predominant α-phase, the degree of crystallinity greatly increased. MAST and C-AST protocols were, to some extent, able to replicate the increase in crystallinity seen in PVDF after ~ 7 years in the field, but no single-stress test condition (UV, damp heat, thermal cycling) resulted in significant changes in the material properties. The MAST regimen used here was too extreme to produce realistic degradation, but the test was useful in discovering weaknesses of the particular PVDF-based outer layer structure studied. No excessive β-phase formation was observed after aging with any test condition; however, the presence of β-phase was identified locally by Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR). We conclude that both MAST and C-AST are relevant tests for screening outdoor failure mechanisms in PVDF backsheets, as they were successful in producing material degradation that led to cracking.</p>","Nature Publishing Group","","National Renewable Energy Lab.

In the framework of the International Energy Agency’s Photovoltaic Power Systems Program Task 16, the solar irradiance nowcast algorithms, based on five all-sky imagers (ASIs), are used to investigate the feasibility of ASIs to foresee ramp events. ASIs 1–2 and ASIs 3–5 can capture the true ramp events by 26.0–51.0% and 49.0–92.0% of the cases, respectively. ASIs 1–2 provided the lowest (<10.0%) falsely documented ramp events while ASIs 3–5 recorded false ramp events up to 85.0%. On the other hand, ASIs 3–5 revealed the lowest falsely documented no ramp events (8.0–51.0%). ASIs 1–2 are developed to provide spatial solar irradiance forecasts and have been delimited only to a small area for the purposes of this benchmark, which penalizes these approaches. These findings show that ASI-based nowcasts could be considered as a valuable tool for predicting solar irradiance ramp events for a variety of solar energy technologies. The combination of physical and deep learning-based methods is identified as a potential approach to further improve the ramp event forecasts.","MDPI","","National Renewable Energy Lab.

"Dye-Sensitized Multiple Exciton Generation in Lead Sulfide Quantum Dots","Huang, Zhiyuan; Beard, Matthew C.","36 MATERIALS SCIENCE; 14 SOLAR ENERGY; hybrid organic/inorganic systems; multiple exciton generation; nanostructures; PbS QDs; solar-photochemistry","Multiple exciton generation (MEG), the generation of multiple excitons from the absorption of a single high-energy photon, is a strategy to go beyond the limiting efficiencies that define current-day solar cells by harvesting some of the thermalization energy losses that occur when photons with an energy greater than the semiconductor bandgap are absorbed. In this work, we show that organic dyes can sensitize MEG in semiconductor quantum dots (QDs). In particular, we found that surface-anchored pyrene ligands enhanced the photon-to-charge carrier quantum yield of PbS QDs from 113 +/- 3% to 183 +/- 7% when the photon energy was 3.9 times the band gap. A wavelength dependence study shows that the enhancement is positively correlated with the pyrene absorptivity. Transient absorption and steady-state photoluminescence measurements suggest that the MEG sensitization is based on an initial fast electron transfer from the pyrene ligands to the PbS QDs producing hot-electrons in the QDs that subsequently undergo MEG. This work demonstrates that hybrid and synergistic organic/inorganic interactions can be a successful strategy to enhance MEG.","American Chemical Society","","National Renewable Energy Lab.

"Evaluating WRF-Solar EPS cloud mask forecast using the NSRDB","Yang, Jaemo; Sengupta, Manajit; Jimenez, Pedro A.; Kim, Ju-Hye; Xie, Yu","14 SOLAR ENERGY; cloud forecast; cloud mask; day-ahead forecast; NSRDB; WRF-Solar EPS","Improving the accuracy of day-ahead solar forecasts using numerical weather prediction models requires improving the forecasting of cloud occurrence and properties. Validating cloud forecasts is challenging because this requires evaluating different types of clouds over a wide variety of regions. This study analyzes the cloud occurrence (or cloud mask) over the contiguous United States (CONUS), predicted by the Weather Research and Forecasting-Solar Ensemble Prediction System (WRF-Solar EPS), to identify the strengths and limitations of the model in reproducing cloud fields. To enable the in-depth analysis of cloud mask forecasts covering CONUS, we use satellite observations from the National Solar Radiation Database (NSRDB). Two evaluation methods are implemented to consider all clouds and partially removed clouds from the 2-km NSRDB in evaluating the 9-km WRF-Solar EPS cloud mask. Cloud detection metrics as well as the frequency of cloud occurrence are used to quantify the monthly performance of WRF-Solar EPS. Mismatched cloud frequency (MCF) is used to assess the model's capability to predict different types of clouds, which are classified using three levels of cloud optical depth (COD) and cloud top height (CTH). The day-ahead forecasts covering the full year of 2018 demonstrate that WRF-Solar EPS produces MCFs ranging from 27%-46%, 13%-34%, and 8%-19% for thin, mid-thickness, and thick clouds, respectively. For three CTH levels, the model shows MCFs ranging from 19%-46%, 16%-33%, and 8%-27% for low-level, middle-level, and high-level clouds, respectively. This comprehensive characterization of model performance helps identify model weakness and will eventually lead to improvements in cloud and solar radiation forecasting.","Elsevier","","National Renewable Energy Lab.

These efficiencies are reported at standard test conditions (STC), established by the photovoltaic (PV) community to facilitate comparison between devices and technologies. Herein, it is discussed why an accurate STC performance measurement for a MJ is more complicated than for a 1 J cell and the special aspects to be considered when measuring the current-voltage characteristics and the performance of PVSK-containing MJ cells are emphasized. It is discussed why a spectrally adjustable solar simulator is needed and the sequence of accurate performance measurement, namely measurement of the spectral response of each junction, adjustment of the spectrum, and appropriate protocols for measuring the power output of the device at STC, is presented. For all these, common errors and pitfalls that sometime lead to misleading interpretation of the results are presented, and the methods to evaluate the accuracy of the data when a spectrally adjustable solar simulator is not available are recommended. Finally, first step is taken toward recommending performance measurement approaches when high throughput is required as will eventually be in a production line.","Wiley","","National Renewable Energy Lab.

From oxide perovskites used in ultrasonics to halide perovskites that have revolutionized the photovoltaics industry, the discovery of new perovskite materials has historically impacted a wide number of fields. Here, we add two new perovskites, CeWN<sub>3</sub> and CeMoN<sub>3</sub>, to the list of experimentally realized perovskite nitrides using highthroughput computational screening and subsequent highthroughput thin film growth techniques. Candidate compositions are first down-selected using a tolerance factor and then thermochemical stability. A novel competing fluorite-family phase is identified for both material systems, which we hypothesize is a transient intermediate phase that crystallizes during the evolution from an amorphous material to a stable perovskite. Different processing routes to overcome the competing fluorite phase and obtain phase-pure nitride perovskites are demonstrated for the CeMoN<sub>3–x</sub> and CeWN<sub>3–x</sub> material systems, which provide a starting point for the development of future nitride perovskites. Additionally, we find that these new perovskite phases have interesting low-temperature magnetic behavior: CeMoN<sub>3–x</sub> orders antiferromagnetically below T<sub>N</sub> ≈ 8 K with indications of strong magnetic frustration, while CeWN<sub>3–x</sub> exhibits no long-range order down to T = 2 K but has strong antiferromagnetic correlations. This work demonstrates the importance and effectiveness of using high-throughput techniques, both computational and experimental: they are integral to optimize the process of realizing two entirely novel nitride perovskites.","American Chemical Society","","Colorado School of Mines, Golden, CO (United States); National Renewable Energy Lab.

We introduce a crack widening technique to control the optical transparency and sheet resistance while decoupling the relative areas of the electron and hole contacts in the back-contact network.

Here, we examine UV-induced degradation (UVID) in various commercial, unencapsulated crystalline silicon cell technologies, including bifacial silicon heterojunction (HJ), interdigitated back contact (IBC), passivated emitter and rear contact (PERC), and passivated emitter rear totally diffused (PERT) solar cells. We performed UV exposure tests using UVA-340 fluorescent lamps at 1.24 W·m<sup>–2</sup> (at 340 nm) and 45°C through 4.02 MJ·m<sup>–2</sup> (2000 h). Our results showed that modern cell architectures are more vulnerable to UVID, leading to a significant power decrease (–3.6% on average; –11.8% maximum) compared with the conventional aluminum back surface field (Al-BSF) cells (<–1% on average). The power degradation is largely caused by the decrease in short-circuit current and open-circuit voltage. A greater power decrease is observed in bifacial cells with rear-side exposure compared with those with front-side exposure, indicating that the rear side is more susceptible to UV damage. Secondary ion mass spectroscopy (SIMS) confirmed an increase in hydrogen concentration near the Si/passivation interface in HJ and IBC cells after UV exposure; the excess of hydrogen could result in hydrogen-induced degradation and subsequently cause higher recombination losses. Additionally, surface oxidation and hot-carrier damage were identified in PERT cells. Using a spectral-based analysis, we obtained an acceleration factor of 5× between unpackaged cells (containing a silicon nitride antireflective coating on the front) in the UV test and an encapsulated module (with the front glass and encapsulant blocking 90% of the UV at 294 nm and 353 nm, respectively) in outdoor conditions. From the analytical calculations, we show that a UV-blocking encapsulant can reduce UV transmission in the module by an additional factor of ~50.","Wiley Blackwell (John Wiley & Sons)","","National Renewable Energy Lab.

Thus, being able to separate device layers and reuse the original substrate is highly desirable, but existing techniques to lift a film from a substrate have substantial drawbacks. This work discusses some of the complexities with the growth of a watersoluble, alkali halide salt thin film between a III–V substrate and overlayer. Much of the difficulty stems from the growth of GaAs on an actively decomposing NaCl surface at elevated temperatures. Interestingly, the presence of an in situ electron beam incident on the NaCl surface, prior to and during GaAs deposition, affects the crystallinity and morphology of the III–V overlayer. Here, we investigate a wide range of growth temperatures and the timing of the impinging flux of both elemental sources and high energy electrons at different points during the growth.

Stable operation of photoanodes has been demonstrated with wide-gap semiconductors, as well as protected visible gap semiconductors. Visible photoresponse from electrochemically stable materials is quite rare. In this paper, we report the high-throughput discovery of an amorphous Ni-Sb (1:1) oxide photoanode that meets the requirements of operational stability, visible photoresponse, and appreciable photovoltage. X-ray absorption characterization of Ni and Sb establishes a structural connection to rutile NiSb2O6, guiding electronic structure characterization via X-ray photoelectron experiments and density functional theory. This amorphous photoanode opens avenues for photoelectrode development due to the lack of crystal anisotropy combined with its operational stability, which mitigates the formation of an interphase that disrupts the semiconductor-electrolyte junction.","Elsevier","","National Renewable Energy Lab.

In this work, we examine the interfacial degradation modes in G/G and glass/transparent backsheet modules under damp heat (DH) with and without system bias voltage, comparing emerging polyolefin elastomer (POE) and industry-standard poly(ethylene-co-vinyl acetate) (EVA) encapsulants. We investigate the transport of ionic species at cell/encapsulant interfaces, demonstrating that POE limits both sodium and silver ion migration compared with EVA. Changes to the chemical structures of the encapsulants at the cell/encapsulant interfaces demonstrate that both POE and EVA are more susceptible to degradation in modules with a transparent backsheet than in the G/G configuration. Adhesion testing reveals that POE and EVA have comparable critical debond energies after the DH exposures regardless of system bias polarity. The results of this study indicate that the interfacial degradation mechanisms of G/G appear to be similar to those of conventional glass/backsheet modules. For emerging materials, our results demonstrate that POE offers advantages over EVA but that transparent backsheets may accelerate encapsulant degradation due to increased moisture ingress when compared with the G/G structure.","Wiley Blackwell (John Wiley & Sons)","","National Renewable Energy Lab.

"Control of light, spin and charge with chiral metal halide semiconductors","Lu, Haipeng; Vardeny, Zeev Valy; Beard, Matthew C.","71 CLASSICAL AND QUANTUM MECHANICS, GENERAL PHYSICS; 14 SOLAR ENERGY; chiral semiconductors; metal-halide perovskite","We report the relationship between the structural asymmetry and optoelectronic properties of functional materials is an active area of research. The movement of charges through an oriented chiral medium depends on the spin configuration of the charges, and such systems can be used to control spin populations without magnetic components - termed the chiral-induced spin selectivity (CISS) effect. CISS has mainly been studied in chiral organic molecules and their assemblies. Semiconductors are non-magnetic extended systems that allow for the control of charge transport, as well as the absorption and emission of light. Therefore, introducing chirality into semiconductors would enable control over charge, spin and light without magnetic components. Chiral metal halide semiconductors (MHSs) are hybrid organic-inorganic materials that combine the properties of small chiral organic molecules with those of extended inorganic semiconductors. Reports of CISS in chiral MHSs have resulted in breakthroughs in our understanding of CISS and in the realization of spin-dependent optoelectronic properties. This Review examines the fundamentals and applications of CISS in chiral MHSs. The structural diversity and key structure-property relationships, such as chiral transfer from the organic to the inorganic components, are summarized. With a focus on the underlying chemistry and physics, the control of spin, light and charge in these semiconductors is explored.","Springer Nature","","National Renewable Energy Lab.

The power tower, or central receiver, configuration can achieve higher operating temperatures than other forms of CSP, and, like all forms of CSP, naturally pairs with comparatively inexpensive thermal energy storage, which allows CSP plants to dispatch electricity according to market price incentives and outside the hours of solar resource availability. Currently, CSP plants commonly include a steam Rankine power cycle and several heat exchange components to generate high-pressure steam using stored thermal energy. The efficiency of the steam Rankine cycle depends on the temperature of the plant's operating fluid, and so is a main concern of plant operators. However, the variable nature of the solar resource and the conservatism with which the receiver is operated prevent perfect control over the receiver outlet temperature. Therefore, during periods of solar variability, collection occurs at lower-than-design temperature. To support operator decisions in a real-time setting, we develop a revenue-maximizing non-convex mixed-integer, quadradically-constrained program which determines a dispatch schedule with sub-hourly time fidelity and considers temperature-dependent power cycle efficiency. The exact nonlinear formulation proves intractable for real-time decision support. Here we present exact and inexact techniques to improve problem tractability that include a hybrid nonlinear and linear formulation. Our approach admits solutions within approximately 3% of optimality, on average, within a five-minute time limit, demonstrating its usability for decision support in a real-time setting.","Springer","","National Renewable Energy Lab.

However, there are still numerous scientific and engineering challenges that must be overcame in order to turn solar fuels into a viable technology.

Device defects are identified and related to morphological spalling defects - arrest lines, gull wings, and river lines - and their impact on cell performance using physical and functional characterization techniques. River line defects have the most consistent and detrimental effect on cell performance. Devices achieve a single junction efficiency above 23% and open-circuit voltage of 1.01 V, demonstrating that spalled germanium does not need to be returned to a pristine, polished state to achieve high-quality device performance.","Wiley Blackwell (John Wiley & Sons)","","National Renewable Energy Lab.

The hygroscopicity and migration of these dopants, however, lead to devices with limited stability. To solve this problem, we report here on a diphenyl iodide cation and pentafluorophenyl boric acid anion-based dopant (DIC-PBA) with an oriented interfacial dipole moment as an alternative to Li-TFSI/t-BP. Theoretical and experimental data reveal that DIC-PBA exhibits deep doping of poly[bis(4-phenyl)(2,4,6-triMethylphenyl)aMine] (PTAA) and also creates p-doping of perovskite surface, which originates from ionic interactions-derived dipole arrangement that yields fast interfacial charge transport. The improved intrinsic stability of PSCs originates from the inhibition of dipole moment degeneration on the perovskite surface. Devices prepared with DIC-PBA yielded high efficiency of 22.86%, and the modules (aperture area: 33.2 cm<sup>2</sup>) efficiency reached 19.13%.

Here, in this study, temperature-dependent current voltage (JVT) and time-resolved photoluminescence (TRPL) experiments were combined with modeling using the solar cell capacitance simulator (SCAPS) computer code to investigate the effect of the RbF PDT. Two devices, one as-deposited and one with RbF PDT, were deposited by a three stage coevaporation process. JVT measurements suggest the dominant recombination mechanism may be tunneling-enhanced recombination via bandtail states, but that defect states in the bandgap can also be important. RbF PDT is shown to decrease the characteristic energy of the bandtails. TRPL data show an increase in the minority carrier lifetime after RbF PDT, leading to an improved open-circuit voltage. SCAPS modeling indicates that the dominant recombination mechanism is dependent on the specific defect makeup of a device, suggesting that small changes in processing conditions can impact device behavior.

"A critical review of the circular economy for lithium-ion batteries and photovoltaic modules – status, challenges, and opportunities","Heath, Garvin A.; Ravikumar, Dwarakanath; Hansen, Brianna; Kupets, Elaine","14 SOLAR ENERGY; 29 ENERGY PLANNING, POLICY, AND ECONOMY; 25 ENERGY STORAGE; circular economy; end of life; LIB; lithium-ion battery; PV; recycling","To meet net-zero emissions and cost targets for power production, recent analysis indicates that photovoltaic (PV) capacity in the United States could exceed 1 TW by 2050 alongside comparable levels of energy storage capacity, mostly from batteries. For comparison, the total U.S. utility-scale power capacity from all energy sources in 2020 was 1.2 TW, of which solar satisfied approximately 3%. With such massive scales of deployment, questions have arisen regarding issues of material supply for manufacturing, end-of-life management of technologies, environmental impacts across the life cycle, and economic costs to both individual consumers and society at large. A set of solutions to address these issues center on the development of a circular economy - shifting from a take-make-waste linear economic model to one that retains the value of materials and products as long as possible, recovering materials at end of life to recirculate back into the economy. With limited global experience, scholars and practitioners have begun to investigate circular economy pathways, focusing on applying novel technologies and analytical methods to fast-growing sectors like renewable energy. This critical review aims to synthesize the growing literature to identify key insights, gaps, and opportunities for research and implementation of a circular economy for two of the leading technologies that enable the transition to a renewable energy economy: solar PV and lithium-ion batteries (LIBs). We apply state-of-the-science systematic literature review procedures to critically analyze over 3,000 publications on the circular economy of solar PV and LIBs, categorizing those that pass a series of objective screens in ways that can illuminate the current state of the art, highlight existing impediments to a circular economy, and recommend future technological and analytical research. We conclude that while neither PV nor LIB industries have reached a circular economy, they are both on a path towards increased circularity. Based on our assessment of the state of current literature and scientific understanding, we recommend research move beyond its prior emphasis on recycling technology development to more comprehensively investigate other CE strategies, more holistically consider economic, environmental and policy aspects of CE strategies, increase leveraging of digital information systems that can support acceleration towards a CE, and to continue to study CE-related aspects of LIB and PV markets.","Informa UK Limited","","National Renewable Energy Lab.

One crucial component to elucidating the impact of strain in the MHP absorber is a robust method of quantifying the amount of strain in the material. In this work, we present a parametric refinement approach based on grazing incidence wide-angle X-ray scattering and demonstrate its use on quantifying strain during thermal annealing and subsequent cooling as a function of substrate and processing route. We use the analysis to reveal the impact of the cubic-to-tetragonal phase transition during cooling on the material's strain and discuss texture formation as a potential strain-relief mechanism. Thereby we present both a robust approach to quantify strain in MHPs and potential mechanisms to control strain in the film, opening the path for further investigations of strain in MHPs.","American Chemical Society (ACS)","","National Renewable Energy Lab.

Employing LEDs to simulate underwater solar spectra at various depths, we compare Si and CdTe solar cells, two commercially available technologies, with GaInP cells, a technology with a wide bandgap close to ideal for underwater solar harvesting. We use this method to show that while Si cells outperform both CdTe and GaInP cells under terrestrial AM1.5G solar irradiance, CdTe and GaInP cells outperform Si cells at depths >2 m, with GaInP cells operating with underwater efficiencies approaching 54%.","Elsevier","","National Renewable Energy Lab.

We present a case study on a single cell in a commercial module. We monitored electrical continuity loss across cracks using electroluminescence (EL) imaging. 10 Pa pressure cycles caused negligible change. 30 Pa pressure cycles caused permanent damage that continued worsening even after tens of thousands of cycles.

Hence, solar energy utilization via direct triplet energy transfer (TET) from semiconductors is challenging. TET from lead halide perovskite semiconductors to nearby organic molecules has been illustrated with ultrafast spectroscopy. Direct utilization of solar energy, i.e., visible light, via TET for photocatalysis is an important route but has not yet been demonstrated with lead halide perovskite semiconductors. Here, we show that a photocatalytic reaction, focusing on a 2 + 2 cycloaddition reaction, can been successfully demonstrated via TET from lead halide perovskite nanocrystals (PNCs). In this work, the triplet excitons are shown to induce a highly diastereomeric syn-selective 2 + 2 cycloaddition starting from olefins. Such photocatalytic reactions probe the TET process previously only observed spectroscopically. Moreover, our observation demonstrates that bulk-like PNCs (size, >10 nm; PL = 530 nm), in addition to quantum-confined smaller PNCs, are also effective for TET. Our findings may render a new energy conversion pathway to employ PNCs via direct TET for photocatalytic organic synthesis.","American Chemical Society (ACS)","","National Renewable Energy Lab.

After computational identification of the indirect-gap semiconductor CaCuP as a promising candidate, we now report reactive sputter deposition of phase-pure p-type CaCuP thin films. Their intrinsic hole concentration and hole mobility exceed 1 x 10<sup>20</sup> cm<sup>-3</sup> and 35 cm<sup>2</sup> V<sup>-1</sup> s<sup>-1</sup> at room temperature, respectively. Transport calculations indicate potential for even higher mobilities. Copper vacancies are identified as the main source of conductivity, displaying markedly different behaviour compared to typical p-type transparent conductors, leading to improved electronic properties. The optical transparency of CaCuP films is lower than expected from first principles calculations of phonon-mediated indirect transitions. This discrepancy could be partly attributed to crystalline imperfections within the films, increasing the strength of indirect transitions. We determine the transparent conductor figure of merit of CaCuP films as a function of composition, revealing links between stoichiometry, crystalline quality, and opto-electronic properties. These findings provide a promising initial assessment of the viability of CaCuP as a p-type transparent contact.","Royal Society of Chemistry (RSC)","","National Renewable Energy Lab.

We present guidelines designed to rigorously test the radiation tolerance of perovskite PVs. We review radiation conditions in common orbits, calculate nonionizing and ionizing energy losses (NIEL and IEL) for perovskites, and prioritize proton radiation for effective nuclear interactions. Low-energy protons (0.05-0.15 MeV) create a representative uniform damage profile, whereas higher energy protons (commonly used in ground-based evaluation) require significantly higher fluence to accumulate the equivalent displacement damage dose due to lower scattering probability. Furthermore, high-energy protons may ""heal"" devices through increased electronic ionization.

Traditional DER compensation frameworks, specifically net energy metering (NEM), inadequately communicate differences in the locational and temporal value of DER generation to the grid. As a transition from NEM, New York State's (NYS's) Value of Distributed Energy Resources (VDER) framework provides a methodology for calculating different value components that DERs offer the grid. To study the impacts of VDER frameworks on DER deployment, we developed a model to assess the value of distributed solar and wind systems configured as either a behind-the-meter system or a front-of-the-meter system for each parcel of land in NYS. Using parcel-level granularity, we can closely evaluate DER locational value and siting availability, particularly in urban and suburban settings. Our analysis finds while most DER generators would be modestly compensated for deferred transmission and distribution infrastructure upgrades (~0.01 $\$$/kWh for solar PV), a subset of projects receive significant value from this component (0.035 to 0.089 $\$$/kWh for top 5% of parcels for solar PV). Finally, our analysis finds VDER provides less overall compensation than NEM to the average DER generator, however, it increases access to compensation for front-of-the-meter DERs - a large and emerging market.","Elsevier","","National Renewable Energy Lab.

"An all optical approach for comprehensive in-operando analysis of radiative and nonradiative recombination processes in GaAs double heterostructures","Zhang, Fan; Castaneda, Jose F.; Gfroerer, Timothy H.; Friedman, Daniel; Zhang, Yong-Hang; Wanlass, Mark W.; Zhang, Yong","71 CLASSICAL AND QUANTUM MECHANICS, GENERAL PHYSICS; 14 SOLAR ENERGY; excitation density; LO phonon plasmon; nonradiative recombination process; photoluminescence; photovoltaic; PL; PV; radiative recombination process; Raman measurement","We demonstrate an all optical approach that can surprisingly offer the possibility of yielding much more information than one would expect, pertinent to the carrier recombination dynamics via both radiative and nonradiative processes when only one dominant deep defect level is present in a semiconductor material. By applying a band-defect state coupling model that explicitly treats the inter-band radiative recombination and Shockley–Read–Hall (SRH) recombination via the deep defect states on an equal footing for any defect center occupation fraction, and analyzing photoluminescence (PL) as a function of excitation density over a wide range of the excitation density (e.g., 5–6 orders in magnitude), in conjunction with Raman measurements of the LO-phonon plasmon (LOPP) coupled mode, nearly all of the key parameters relevant to the recombination processes can be obtained. They include internal quantum efficiency (IQE), minority and majority carrier density, inter-band radiative recombination rate (W<sub>r</sub>), minority carrier nonradiative recombination rate (W<sub>nr</sub>), defect center occupation fraction (f), defect center density (N<sub>t</sub>), and minority and majority carrier capture cross-sections (σ<sub>t</sub> and σ<sub>tM</sub>). While some of this information is thought to be obtainable optically, such as IQE and the W<sub>r</sub>/W<sub>nr</sub> ratio, most of the other parameters are generally considered to be attainable only through electrical techniques, such as current-voltage (I-V) characteristics and deep level transient spectroscopy (DLTS). Following a procedure developed herein, this approach has been successfully applied to three GaAs double-heterostructures that exhibit two distinctly different nonradiative recombination characteristics. The method greatly enhances the usefulness of the simple PL technique to an unprecedented level, facilitating comprehensive material and device characterization without the need for any device processing.","Nature Publishing Group","","National Renewable Energy Lab.

Achieving simultaneous highly efficient and stable unassisted PEC water splitting has been the “holy grail” in clean and renewable fuel generation. State-of-the-art photoelectrodes have shown relatively high efficiencies (~10–20%). Still, their stability is limited due to photoelectrode chemical instability, electrolyte resistance, mass transfer issues, and an often unoptimized experimental setup. In this work, we present a framework and a set of protocols for conducting long-term stability experiments and further provide details on several critical factors such as light source calibration, choosing the right counter electrode, the configuration of the PEC cell, and photoelectrode sample preparation.","Frontiers Media SA","","Lawrence Berkeley National Lab.

"Understanding the Effect of Lead Iodide Excess on the Performance of Methylammonium Lead Iodide Perovskite Solar Cells","Ahmad, Zeeshan; Scheidt, Rebecca A.; Hautzinger, Matthew P.; Zhu, Kai; Beard, Matthew C.; Galli, Giulia","14 SOLAR ENERGY; 36 MATERIALS SCIENCE; metal halide perovskite; transient spectroscopy","The presence of unreacted lead iodide in organic-inorganic lead halide perovskite solar cells is widely correlated with an increase in power conversion efficiency. We investigate the mechanism for this increase by identifying the role of surfaces and interfaces present between methylammonium lead iodide perovskite films and excess lead iodide. We show how type I and II band alignments arising under different conditions result in either passivation of surface defects or hole injection. Through first-principles simulations of solid-solid interfaces, we find that lead iodide captures holes from methylammonium lead iodide and modulates the formation of defects in the perovskite, affecting recombination. Using surface-sensitive optical spectroscopy techniques, such as transient reflectance and time-resolved photoluminescence, we show how excess lead iodide affects the diffusion and surface recombination velocity of charge carriers in methylammonium lead iodide films. Our coupled experimental and theoretical results elucidate the role of excess lead iodide in perovskite solar cells.","American Chemical Society (ACS)","","National Renewable Energy Lab.

"Incorporating energy justice into utility-scale photovoltaic deployment: A policy framework","Heeter, Jenny; Reames, Tony","29 ENERGY PLANNING, POLICY, AND ECONOMY; 14 SOLAR ENERGY; energy equity; energy justice; environmental justice; utility programs; utility-scale photovoltaics","Utility-scale photovoltaic (PV) installations made up 77 GW (6%) of installed capacity in the United States, as of the end of 2021. This will grow to more than 500 GW by 2050 under a mid-case projection or more than 800 GW if solar costs decline more rapidly. While utility-scale PV is projected to grow rapidly, to date, unlike energy efficiency or distributed PV, utility-scale PV has not been used to provide substantial financial benefits to underserved communities, either through ownership, financing of assets, or direct electricity bill reduction. We assess two mechanisms through which utility-scale PV could benefit underserved communities. We find that while a framework for direct electricity bill reduction can be meaningful to customers, this mechanism falls short of providing restorative justice via wealth creation for minority-owned businesses. In contrast, we find that a framework for procurement of utility-scale PV by public and private entities from PV projects that are financed, owned, and/or developed by minority-owned businesses can provide this restorative justice benefit, and thereby facilitate an equitable energy transition. We conclude with concrete recommendations for new policies and programs to ensure that the benefits of utility-scale PV systems are distributed to underserved communities.","Elsevier","","National Renewable Energy Lab.

A large global network of PV module manufacturers and PV testing laboratories collaborated to design a protocol for LETID detection and screen a large and diverse set of prototype modules for LETID. Results across labs indicate the reproducibility of LETID testing is likely within +/-1% of maximum power (PMP). In intentionally engineered LETID-sensitive modules, mean degradation after the prescribed detection stress is roughly 6% PMP. In other module types the LETID sensitivity is smaller, and in some we observe essentially negligible degradation attributable to LETID. In LETID-sensitive modules, both open-circuit voltage (VOC) and short-circuit current (ISC) degrade by a roughly similar magnitude. We observe, as do previous studies, that LETID affects each cell in a module differently. An investigation of the potential mismatch losses caused by nonuniform LETID degradation found that mismatch loss is insignificant compared to the estimated loss of cell ISC, which drives loss of module ISC. Overall, this work has helped inform the creation of a forthcoming standard technical specification for LETID testing of PV modules, IEC TS 63342 ED1, and should aid in the interpretation of results from that and other LETID tests.","Wiley Blackwell (John Wiley & Sons)","","National Renewable Energy Lab.

Shockley-Read-Hall recombination center defect density, identified and characterized through deep level transient spectroscopy and time-resolved photoluminescence (TRPL), is reduced through potassium and copper treatment optimization. Concomitantly, longer minority carrier lifetimes are achieved, which increases open-circuit voltage (V<sub>OC</sub>). Near-conduction band defects associated in earlier studies with light-induced current instability are also mitigated. Analysis of charge-carrier dynamics after single- and two-photon excitation is used to separate recombination at the front interface and in the absorber bulk. From TRPL decay simulations, the authors estimate ranges of key solar cell material characteristics: bulk carrier lifetime T<sub>bulk</sub> = 110-210 ns, charge-carrier mobility u = 110-160 cm<sup>2</sup> V<sup>-1</sup> s<sup>-1</sup>, and front interface recombination velocity S<sub>front</sub> = 700-1050 cm s<sup>-1</sup>. This lowest-reported S<sub>front</sub> for ACIGS absorbers originates from the notched conduction band grading, which also makes the impact of the back interface recombination negligible. It is suggested in the results that solar cell performance enhancements can be made most readily with two distinct strategies: improving device architecture and reducing semiconductor defect densities. Using these approaches, power conversion efficiency in large-area solar cells is improved by 1.1% absolute.","Wiley","","National Renewable Energy Lab.

At a current certified record efficiency of 25.7% for a single-junction, research-scale cell, they now garner serious attention from the solar cell industry as a promising route to widespread, low-cost photovoltaics in single- or tandem-junction configurations. However, more work to demonstrate their durability under real-world outdoor test conditions is necessary to ensure the long-term success and deployment of the technology. Differences in chemistry, processes, and their combination result in unique performance limiters for both efficiency and stability. Further, as many active formulations and layer/cell stack combinations are sensitive to temperature, air, and moisture, it is important to separate intrinsic limitations to stability relative to these extrinsic sources. This presents a particular need for the development of an appropriate and reliable package for environmental (i.e., accelerated and outdoor) testing that will permit these different factors to be evaluated and understood.","American Chemical Society (ACS)","","National Renewable Energy Lab.

Controlled spalling offers a fracture-based path to substrate cost amortization, enabling device exfoliation and substrate reuse, but the faceted surface generated during the spalling of (100)-oriented GaAs presents hurdles to direct regrowth of subsequent devices. Spalling of (110) substrates instead eliminates faceting by aligning the substrate surface with the predominant crystal cleavage plane. III-V epitaxy of solar cells is significantly less developed on (110)-oriented substrates, however. Here, we develop (110)-based GaAs solar cells grown by HVPE on epi-ready substrates, demonstrating equal performance to devices grown on the more standard (100) orientation. We also characterize the surface of spalled, (110)-oriented substrates, revealing flat terraces separated by steps with sub-micron-scale height on average. Finally, we present an initial device grown on a previously spalled surface without additional surface re-preparation with nearly 16% efficiency under a simulated AM1.5G spectrum.

However, most real selective absorbers have a fairly broad transition, leading to both solar absorption and thermal emission losses. Here, we model, fabricate, and characterize a highly selective semiconductor-dielectric-metal (Ga0.46In0.54As - MgF2 - Ag) solar absorber with an extremely sharp transition from high to low absorptance. The thin semiconductor serves as a selective filter, absorbing photons with wavelengths shorter than the bandgap and transmitting those with longer wavelengths. The highly reflective dielectric-metal rear mirror allows the structure to have very low emittance for longer wavelengths. These characteristics provide the absorber with a measured solar absorptance >91% below the bandgap wavelength and infrared emittance <5% at 100 degrees C above the bandgap wavelength. This transition wavelength can be tuned by modifying the semiconductor composition, and modeling indicates that the absorber's optical properties should be stable at high temperatures, making the structure a good candidate for unconcentrated to highly concentrated solar thermal energy conversion.","Elsevier","","National Renewable Energy Lab.

Since the first demonstration of 29% efficient TPVs (Fig. 1a) using an integrated back surface reflector and a tungsten emitter at 2,000°C (ref. 10), TPV fabrication and performance have improved. However, despite predictions that TPV efficiencies can exceed 50%, the demonstrated efficiencies are still only as high as 32%, albeit at much lower temperatures below 1,300 C (refs. 13,14,15). Here we report the fabrication and measurement of TPV cells with efficiencies of more than 40% and experimentally demonstrate the efficiency of high-bandgap tandem TPV cells. The TPV cells are two-junction devices comprising III–V materials with bandgaps between 1.0 and 1.4 eV that are optimized for emitter temperatures of 1,900–2,400°C. The cells exploit the concept of band-edge spectral filtering to obtain high efficiency, using highly reflective back surface reflectors to reject unusable sub-bandgap radiation back to the emitter. A 1.4/1.2 eV device reached a maximum efficiency of (41.1 ± 1)% operating at a power density of 2.39 W cm<sup>–2</sup> and an emitter temperature of 2,400°C. A 1.2/1.0 eV device reached a maximum efficiency of (39.3 ± 1)% operating at a power density of 1.8 W cm–2 and an emitter temperature of 2,127°C.

PV has grown at an annual compounded growth rate of approximately 30% in the last three decades. Solar energy systems will continue their impressive growth in distributed energy, microgrids, and utility scale, as efforts are made for dependable electricity in an age with increasing extreme weather. However, within this remarkable success lies a new challenge. The growth curve, combined with rapid product innovation and scale up, means that the majority of PV systems are new, without the three years of performance data that have been required in the past to estimate product lifetime. PV reliability has to address this challenge. In this review we present a brief summary of PV reliability starting with brief historical synopsis, detailing some of the technological challenges and present a framework required for long lifetime.","IOP Publishing","","National Renewable Energy Lab.

"Impact of specimen preparation method on photovoltaic backsheet degradation during accelerated aging test","Xia, Ji; Liu, Yi; Hu, Hongjie; Zhu, Xiaogang; Lv, Hao; Phillips, Nancy H.; Choudhury, Kaushik Roy; Gambogi, William J.; Rodriguez, Marisol; Simon, Ethan S.; Kempe, Michael; Morse, Joshua","14 SOLAR ENERGY; accelerated aging test; backsheet; cutting embrittlement; photovoltaic; sample preparation; tensile testing","In this study, we highlight some important factors in the specimen preparation methods for evaluating photovoltaic backsheet properties after accelerated aging. Two different sequences are considered: Method (I) cut-then-age: cut into 1-cm wide strips and then expose to stress, and Method (II) age-then-cut: expose a larger sheet to stress and then cut into 1-cm widths for mechanical property measurements. We also compare the effect of three cutting methods, (a) tensile specimen punch, (b) paper cutter, and (c) fresh razor blade. Several commercial backsheets were evaluated, with stress exposures including (a) pressure cooker test (PCT), (b) dry ultraviolet (UV) radiation exposure, and (c) UV combined damp heat tests. Fourier transform infrared spectrometer (FTIR) and intrinsic viscosity (IV) were used to analyze the materials on unstressed materials and samples exposed to PCT. The results show that both the cutting method and the time of cutting have an impact on the backsheet mechanical properties. Additionally, under UV exposure, Method II, age-then-cut, generally resulted in a higher average value, with more variation than Method I; however, if the side strips from Method II were excluded, the variation dropped to the same level. This is because the specimens at the sides of the sheet get additional damage from UV light from the exposed sides of the sample. In contrast to UV exposure, PCT specimens prepared by Method II result in lower average values and higher variability. This is attributed to embrittlement through the bulk of the sample where the cutting of embrittled specimens appears to result in more edge defects which can then initiate a break at smaller strains. The data suggest that for UV exposures, the specimens should be cut after aging and the exposed side specimens discarded, and that for PCT exposures, the specimens should be cut before the exposure.","Society of Chemical Industry, Wiley","","National Renewable Energy Lab.

If the highest carbon-intensity scenarios are realized, 2%-14% of the remaining estimated global carbon budget might be consumed to manufacture modules without including their balance of systems. Applying a carbon cost indicates that CdTe might have an additional value of $\$$0.02-$\$$0.04/W relative to Si PV manufactured with the same energy mix.

Wind plant layout optimization is a difficult, complex problem with a large number of variables and many local minima. Layout optimization only becomes more difficult with the addition of solar generation. In this paper, we propose a parameterized approach to wind and solar hybrid power plant layout optimization that greatly reduces problem dimensionality while guaranteeing that the generated layouts have a desirable regular structure. Thus far, hybrid power plant optimization research has focused on system sizing. We go beyond sizing and present a practical approach to optimizing the physical layout of a wind–solar hybrid power plant. We argue that the evolution strategy class of derivative-free optimization methods is well-suited to the parameterized hybrid layout problem, and we demonstrate how hard layout constraints (e.g., placement restrictions) can be transformed into soft constraints that are amenable to optimization using evolution strategies. Next, we present experimental results on four test sites, demonstrating the viability, reliability, and effectiveness of the parameterized evolution strategy approach for generating optimized hybrid plant layouts. Completing the tool kit for parameterized layout generation, we include a brief tutorial describing how the parameterized evolutionary approach can be inspected, understood, and debugged when applied to hybrid plant layouts.</p>","Copernicus GmbH","","National Renewable Energy Lab.

"System and technoeconomic analysis of solar thermochemical hydrogen production","Ma, Zhiwen; Davenport, Patrick; Saur, Genevieve","08 HYDROGEN; 14 SOLAR ENERGY; H2A analysis; hydrogen production technoeconomic analysis; solar receiver; solar thermochemical hydrogen production; water splitting","Hydrogen is a promising energy carrier that can be obtained from various feedstocks using renewable energy sources. Direct solar thermochemical hydrogen (STCH) production by water splitting can utilize the full spectrum of solar radiation and has the potential to achieve high solar energy conversion efficiencies. Currently STCH research areas focus on material discovery. This paper evaluates the performance of various STCH materials in the context of a system platform to assess techno-economic benefits and gaps in the path to STCH scale-up. Additionally, to analyze the hydrogen production cost, a concentrating solar thermal (CST) system is introduced as a platform for integrating STCH materials and accommodating generalized thermochemical processes. The thermochemical process is based on a two-step STCH cycle using metal oxide that consists of a high temperature step for metal oxide reduction, followed by an oxidation step for water splitting at a lower temperature. A preferred configuration is to have the high temperature step occurring in a directly irradiated solar receiver reactor. To this end, we conceptualized a receiver design and associated solar field layout and investigated STCH operational boundaries, component costs and sensitivity parameters on the $2/kgH<sub>2</sub> goal of hydrogen production. The study explored system-related variables and factors associated with scaling up. The CST platform allows more comprehensive studies that encompass aspects of STCH materials and systems such as cost, hydrogen productivity and replacement frequency, alongside other system components like heliostat field, tower, and potential receiver costs.","Elsevier","","National Renewable Energy Lab.

The main solar cell fabrication technology has shifted over that time and is currently dominated by the passivated emitter and rear cell (PERC). Other technologies are expected to increase in market share, including tunnel-oxide passivated contact (TOPCon) and heterojunction technology (HJT). In this paper, we examine the cost potential for using atomic layer deposition (ALD) to form transition metal oxide (TMO) layers (MoO<sub>x</sub>, TiO<sub>x</sub> and aluminium-doped zinc oxide [AZO]) to use as lower cost alternatives of the p-doped, n-doped and indium tin oxide (ITO) layers, respectively, the layers normally used in HJT solar cells. Using a bottom-up cost and uncertainty model with equipment cost data and process experience in the lab, we find that the production cost of these variations will likely be lower per wafer than standard HJT, with the main cost drivers being the cost of the ALD precursors at high-volume production. We then considered what efficiency is required for these sequences to be cost effective in $/W and discuss whether these targets are technically feasible.

"The “Fresnel Equations” for Diffuse radiation on Inclined photovoltaic Surfaces (FEDIS)","Xie, Yu; Sengupta, Manajit; Habte, Aron; Andreas, Afshin","14 SOLAR ENERGY; observation; PV; pyranometer; solar energy; solar radiation; transmission; Fresnel equations","Here the well-known Fresnel equations solve for the reflection and transmission of light for precise incident angles. The transmission of diffuse radiation incident on a planar or domed surface is often needed for real-world applications. Due to the complexity of the Fresnel equations, the analytical solution of the integration has hitherto been unobtainable over the last centuries. Therefore, this problem was numerically solved by integrating the angular transmittances in space often leading to substantial computing burden and bias in the results. To efficiently estimate the solar energy resource for a glass-covered photovoltaic (PV) module, we derive an analytical solution of diffuse transmission based on the rigorous integration of an alternate form of the Fresnel equations. The approach leads to a simple yet accurate relative transmittance model that reconciles the solar energy sensed by pyranometers and PV panels. With limited and clearly stated approximations, the complex mathematical derivation resulted in an elegant solution. An experiment using 1-year of data at the National Renewable Energy Laboratory's (NREL's) Solar Radiation Research Laboratory (SRRL) shows that the new model dramatically decreases the disparity between the solar radiation measurements by a Kipp and Zonen CM Pyranometer 22 (CMP22) and an IMT reference cell on a 1-axis tracking system.

"Self-Aligned Selective Area Front Contacts on <em>Poly</em>-Si/SiO<sub>x</sub> Passivating Contact <em>c</em>-Si Solar Cells","Chen, Kejun; Hartweg, Barry; Woodhouse, Michael; Guthrey, Harvey; Nemeth, William; Theingi, San; Page, Matthew; Holman, Zachary C.; Stradins, Paul; Agarwal, Sumit; Young, David L.","14 SOLAR ENERGY; dielectric passivation; parasitic absorption; passivating contacts; silicon solar cell","We report both polarity poly-Si/SiO<sub>x</sub> passivating contacts in a front/back device configuration may represent the next solar cell architecture after tunnel oxide passivating contacts (TOPCon) cells, but high parasitic absorption in the front poly -Si layer often limits its performance. This work explores a wet etching technique to remove the front poly -Si in the nonmetallized regions using self-aligned metal grids as an etch mask. We systematically examine various dielectric layers (SiN<sub>x</sub>,Al<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub>, and stacks thereof) to study the repassivation of the etched n<sup>+</sup> surface, and find that an SiN<sub>x</sub>/Al<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub> passivation stack can effectively repassivate the etched surface, which we attribute to field-effect passivation from the positive fixed charge from the SiN<sub>x</sub> layer, and excellent chemical passivation property from Al<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub> in the form of atomic H. We demonstrate a front/back poly-Si/SiO<sub>x</sub> passivating contact device, with an open-circuit voltage (V<sub>oc</sub>) of 690 mV, short-circuit current density (J<sub>sc</sub>) of 39.8 mA/cm<sup>2</sup>, fill factor of 78%, and power conversion efficiency of 21.4%. Furthermore, simulations using SunSolve and Quokka 3 show good agreement with both the optical and electrical properties of the experimental device. The power loss analysis reveals improvements in the optical loss from the back Ti adhesion and front SiN<sub>x</sub> layers would lead to a 23.5% device. Lastly, a techno-economic model compares the production cost of this improved cell with the current TOPCon cells. Our results highlight that further cost reductions in single-sided doped poly -Si layers are needed to compete with mainstream passivated emitter and rear cell, and TOPCon technologies.","IEEE","","National Renewable Energy Lab.

A key common factor for these recent breakthroughs is the development of SnO<sub>2</sub> as an effective electron transport layer in these devices. In this review, we discuss the key advances in SnO<sub>2</sub> development, including various deposition approaches and surface treatment strategies, to enhance the bulk and interface properties of SnO<sub>2</sub> for highly efficient and stable n-i-p PSCs. We also discuss the general materials chemistry associated with SnO<sub>2</sub> along with the corresponding materials challenges and improvement strategies, focusing on defects, intrinsic properties, and impact on device characteristics.

Affected cells show a progressive, series-resistance-related power degradation as shown via module- and cell-level IV curves, along with electroluminescence (EL) and PL imaging at the module, cell, and cell core sample scales. Scanning electron microscopy and energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy reveal a difference in the oxides in the silver paste used in screen printing of the gridline contacts. The paste in the affected cells is lead rich, whereas the paste in the unaffected cells is zinc rich. This suggests that the cells were screen printed with different silver paste compositions and possibly firing conditions, and that the different composition correlates with the susceptibility to degradation. Our results indicate degradation of the contact at the oxide-silver interface, causing a severe increase in series resistance across the cell that continues to progress over time.","IEEE","","National Renewable Energy Lab.

"Automated detection of photovoltaic cleaning events: A performance comparison of techniques as applied to a broad set of labeled photovoltaic data sets","Muller, Matthew; Perry, Kirsten; Micheli, Leonardo; Almonacid, Florencia; Fernández, Eduardo F.","14 SOLAR ENERGY; photovoltaics; soiling; soiling extraction; time series data","Extracting accurate soiling loss information from photovoltaic (PV) production data first requires segmenting the time series data per natural or manually occurring cleaning events. Maintenance logs are often incomplete, rain data are often unavailable, and the debate on rain thresholds for cleaning and dew or wind cleanings is still ongoing. The present work aims to overtake these issues by improving automated methods to detect these cleaning events and therefore improve extraction of soiling loss information. Time series power production data from 22 PV inverters were labeled for natural or manually occurring cleaning events. The data sets were carefully selected to include varying degrees of soiling, cleaning events, and noise. Several algorithms, including filtering logic and change point detection, were examined for efficacy at detecting the labeled cleanings. All the methods introduced except for changepoint detection showed significant improvement at detecting the labeled cleaning events per the mean F<sub>1</sub> score. Furthermore, the highest performing cleaning detection algorithm achieved an absolute increase in the mean F<sub>1</sub> score of 43% over the default version of the RdTools stochastic rate and recovery (SRR) algorithm. The highest performing algorithm included irradiance filtering and a cleaning detection threshold, adjusted based on the 40-day centered rolling median of the absolute day-to-day deviations in the daily performance index (PI). Furthermore, these improvements are promising as cleaning detection is an essential step in the automated analysis of PV soiling.","Wiley","","National Renewable Energy Lab.

We fabricated these contacts on inverted pyramids and v-grooves in addition to the alkaline-textured random pyramids and planar surface morphologies. The thermal breakup of SiO<sub>x</sub> was achieved at peak annealing temperatures of 1050 and 1100 degrees C. SiO<sub>x</sub> breakup at 1050 degrees C resulted in pinholes created preferentially at vertices in the inverted pyramids, while at 1100 degrees C, their formation was random. The density of pinholes was greater in textured samples than in polished samples. Both chemical etching and electron beam-induced current (EBIC) were used to visualize the pinholes, the latter being sensitive only to transport pinholes in the p-n junction but not the n<sup>+</sup>-n junction. We ascribe this difference in EBIC images based on the contact polarity to differences in the collection probability of the minority carriers generated by the electron beam.

Here, we demonstrate a p-n homojunction across the Sn-Pb perovskite resulted from a gradient doping by Ba<sup>2+</sup>. We report that 0.1 mol% Ba<sup>2+</sup> can effectively compensate the p-doping of Sn-Pb perovskites or even turns it to n-type without changing its bandgap.

The gradient doping forms of a homojunction from top to bottom of the perovskite films with a built-in field that facilitates extraction of photogenerated carriers, resulting an increased carrier extraction length. Furthermore, this strategy enhanced the efficiency of Sn-Pb perovskite single-junction solar cells to over 21.0% and boosted the efficiencies of monolithic perovskite-perovskite tandem solar cells to 25.3% and 24.1%, for active areas of 5.9 mm2 and 0.94 cm<sup>2</sup>, respectively.","Wiley","","National Renewable Energy Lab.

"On Residual Stresses and Reference Temperatures in Thermomechanical Simulations of Photovoltaic Modules Using the Finite Element Method","Springer, Martin; Bosco, Nick","14 SOLAR ENERGY; finite element method; numerical simulation; photovoltaic; residual stresses; thermo-mechanical","Thermomechanical simulation of photovoltaic (PV) modules using the finite element method (FEM) is a useful tool to evaluate module design features in terms of structural integrity, reliability, and durability. One of the main challenges in the numerical modeling of a PV module is the incorporation of residual stresses induced by the manufacturing process. Modeling assumptions and abstractions are necessary to limit the model complexity and reduce the computational time. However, oversimplifications and incorrect assumptions can lead to erroneous numerical results. Unfortunately, much simulation work still neglects process-induced stresses. This can lead to incorrect predictions of the stress-strain history and erroneous conclusions during the design process. In this work, we review current modeling practices for incorporating process-induced stresses, and contrast numerical models that consider residual stresses with those that neglect them. We find that the simulation objective and available material properties dictate which process steps need to be modeled, and explore in depth the modeling of residual stresses induced by the lamination process. We demonstrate that a simplified cooldown procedure at the beginning of the simulation can increase the model accuracy and discuss appropriate choices for starting and reference temperatures in the finite element model.","IEEE","","National Renewable Energy Lab.

Our films are irradiated by Cu Ka X-rays and held at 75 °C while X-ray diffraction is recorded. Under all gas conditions, we observe a reproducible 1.1 ± 0.5 A<sup>3</sup> perovskite lattice contraction from an initial unit cell volume of 256.5 ± 0.8 A<sup>3</sup> concurrent with continuous perovskite loss and lead iodide growth. Oxygen-containing gases increase the reaction rates without materially altering perovskite structural changes. Under the same temperature and irradiation conditions in vacuo, a self-healing reaction is observed, exhibited by a reproducible (0.9 ± 0.3 A<sup>3</sup>) lattice expansion and stabilization of the perovskite. Furthermore, interactions between the perovskite, defects, and minority phases are simulated by generalized gradient approximation Perdew-Burke-Ernzerhof (GGA-PBE) density functional theory. Lattice contraction indicates an increase in the concentration of Schottky defects-pairs of formamidinium and iodine vacancies. Under irradiation in every atmospheric condition, a solid solution of Schottky defects with a concentration of several percent diffuses and precipitates forming lead iodide and consuming the defects. In the presence of ionized gases, this framework is modified to include the continual loss of formamidinium and iodine ions from the perovskite forming Schottky defects.","American Chemical Society (ACS)","","National Renewable Energy Lab.

With coordinated management of each inverter in the system, the control system commands the power plant to proactively curtail a small fraction of its instantaneous maximum power potential, which gives the plant enough headroom to ramp up production from the overall power plant, for a service such as regulation reserve. This control system is practical for continuously changing cloud cover conditions in partially cloudy days. A case study from a site in Hawaii with one-second resolution solar irradiance data is used to verify the efficacy of the proposed control system. The proposed control algorithm is subsequently compared with the alternative control technology from the literature, the grouping control algorithm; the results show that the proposed hierarchical control system is over 10 times more effective in reducing generator mileage to support power fluctuations from solar PV power plants.","IEEE","","National Renewable Energy Lab.

"Chemical compatibility of hollow ceramic cenospheres as thermal insulation for high-temperature thermal energy storage applications with molten nitrate salt","Zhao, Youyang; Wagstaff, Emma; Gage, Samuel; Payne, Deanna; Turchi, Craig","36 MATERIALS SCIENCE; 14 SOLAR ENERGY; cenospheres; chemical compatibility; molten nitrate; thermal energy storage; thermal insulation","An effective insulation material that is both thermally and chemically stable in molten salts could transform the design of molten-salt-based thermal energy storage (TES) tanks. Most current molten salt TES tanks hold the metallic tank structure in direct contact with hot salt inventory, a design which leads to thermal expansion of the tank and triggers stresses that can lead to thermomechanical failures. With an internal insulation to lower the temperature at the tank structure, the extent of thermal expansion can be reduced, thereby reducing expansion-induced stresses and allowing for consideration of lower-cost tank structure materials. Conventional insulation materials are either 1) too porous and allow molten salts to permeate into the matrix, which significantly increases the thermal conductivity or 2) too dense and have a thermal conductivity that cannot provide sufficient thermal insulation. This paper presents an alternative thermal insulation concept using cenospheres which have an alumino-silicate structure. The cost analysis suggests that the low-density cenospheres can be one of the cheapest materials to provide cost-effective thermal insulation. The chemical compatibility of cenospheres is investigated in molten 60 wt% NaNO3/40 wt% KNO3 salt which is close to industrial-grade Solar Salt. This paper shows that diffusion of the sodium and potassium cations from the salt into the cenospheres occurs based on weight analysis, energy dispersive spectroscopy (EDS), X-ray diffraction (XRD) and Fourier-transform infrared (FTIR) spectroscopy. The cation diffusion breaks the bridging oxygen bonds and causes volume expansion of the microstructure which is responsible for the failure of the cenosphere particles. The chemical composition of the cenospheres is found to affect their compatibility with molten nitrate salt. A cenosphere product with low iron content showed the best compatibility with an average survival rate of 77.9% +/- 9.8% after 7 days of immersion in the molten nitrate salt. While even the low-iron cenospheres appear to require protection from direct molten salt contact, their slow degradation rate, closed-cell porosity, and low cost hold potential for effective use as internal tank insulation.","Elsevier","","National Renewable Energy Lab.

"Assessing the WRF-Solar Model Performance Using Satellite-Derived Irradiance from the National Solar Radiation Database","Jiménez, Pedro A.; Yang, Jaemo; Kim, Ju-Hye; Sengupta, Manajit; Dudhia, Jimy","14 SOLAR ENERGY; National Solar Radiation Database; NSRDB; numerical weather prediction; WRF-Solar","<title>Abstract</title> <p>WRF-Solar is a numerical weather prediction model specifically designed to meet the increasing demand for accurate solar irradiance forecasting. The model provides flexibility in the representation of the aerosol–cloud–radiation processes. This flexibility can be argued to make it more difficult to improve the model’s performance because of the necessity of inspecting different configurations. To alleviate this situation, WRF-Solar has a reference configuration to use as a benchmark in sensitivity experiments. However, the scarcity of high-quality ground observations is a handicap to accurately quantify the model performance. An alternative to ground observations are satellite irradiance retrievals. Herein we analyze the adequacy of the National Solar Radiation Database (NSRDB) to validate the WRF-Solar performance using high-quality global horizontal irradiance (GHI) observations across the contiguous United States (CONUS). Based on the sufficient performance of NSRDB, we further analyze the WRF-Solar forecast errors across the CONUS, the growth of the forecasting errors as a function of the lead time, and sensitivities to the grid spacing and the representation of the radiative effects of unresolved clouds. Our results based on WRF-Solar forecasts spanning 2018 reveal a 7% median degradation of the mean absolute error (MAE) from the first to the second daytime period. Reducing the grid spacing from 9 to 3 km leads to a 4% improvement in the MAE, whereas activating the radiative effects of unresolved clouds is desirable over most of the CONUS even at 3 km of grid spacing. A systematic overestimation of the GHI is found. These results illustrate the potential of GHI retrievals to contribute to increasing the WRF-Solar performance.</p>","American Meteorological Society","","National Renewable Energy Lab.

"Convolutional neural networks for intra-hour solar forecasting based on sky image sequences","Feng, Cong; Zhang, Jie; Zhang, Wenqi; Hodge, Bri-Mathias","14 SOLAR ENERGY; 97 MATHEMATICS AND COMPUTING; computer vision; deep learning; image processing; sky images; solar forecasting","Accurate and timely solar forecasts play an increasingly critical role in power systems. Compared to longer forecasting timescales, very short-term solar forecasting has lagged behind in both research and practice. In this paper, we propose deep convolutional neural networks (CNNs) to provide operational intra-hour (10-minute-ahead to 60-minute-ahead) solar forecasts. We develop two CNN structures inspired by a widely-used CNN architecture. The CNNs are tailored to our solar forecasting regression tasks and rely solely on sky image sequences. Case studies based on six years of data (over 150,000 data points) demonstrate that the best CNN model has forecast skill scores of 20%-39% over the naive persistence of cloudiness benchmark, even at these very short timescales. The CNNs also have consistently superior performance when compared to shallow machine learning models with meteorological predictors, where the improvement averages around 7%. The sensitivity analyses show that the sky image length, resolution, and weather conditions have impacts on the deep learning model accuracy. In our intra-hour problem with specific setups, two sky images with a 10-minute 128 x 128 resolution yield the most accurate forecasts. Current limitations, future work, and deployment challenges and solutions are also discussed.","Elsevier","","National Renewable Energy Lab.

In order to investigate the passivation effect of potassium ion, we carried out KCl treatment on the solution-processed SnO<sub>2</sub> ETL.

Admittance spectroscopy revealed that diffused K<sup>+</sup> ions can passivate defects of the perovskite absorber layer. With the improvement of band alignment and defect passivation via the KCl treatment, the J-V hysteresis was almost eliminated and power conversion efficiency was much enhanced with improved open-circuit voltage and fill factor.","Elsevier","","National Renewable Energy Lab.

Data analytic techniques such as the performance ratio method, Statistical clear sky model, and Suns-Vmp methods quantify the degradation from measured data of a solar farm, however, the nonlinear time-dependence and correlated degradations make it difficult to use the empirical degradation rates for ultimate lifetime projection. In this article, we propose a complementary physics-based model to predict the solder bond failure caused by mechanical stress associated with the variations of the temperature. Integrating the worldwide weather information from NASA/NSRDB databases, the model predicts the location-specific output-power degradation and the lifetime of a module due to solder bond failure. The model parameters are calibrated against qualification tests involving thermal cycling of specific batches of modules from a specific technology/manufacturer. The results may be summarized as: 1) Modules installed at higher latitudes show a longer lifetime due to reduced damage accumulation. 2) The reduction of temperature fluctuation close to large bodies of water, such as seashores, increases solder bond lifetime significantly. 3) Relatively speaking, modules installed close to the Tropic of Cancer/Capricorn (23.5 degrees North/South) suffer from a higher solder bond damage and have a shorter lifetime, suggesting a conservative design. This model should serve as a building block of a comprehensive reliability framework that can predict the lifetime of a module that experiences simultaneous and correlated degradation mechanisms involving yellowing, corrosion, and potential-induced degradation.","IEEE","","National Renewable Energy Lab.

In this configuration, we find that K-rich borosilicate glass reduces the extent of PID relative to Na-rich soda-lime glass. We also find that the standard testing protocol of stressing cells at short-circuit leads to faster PID than stressing cells at open-circuit. We characterize two types of CIGS PID: The first, front shunting PID, is driven by front-glass stress and occurs when alkali metal cations accumulate in the i-ZnO buffer, where they increase shunt conductance to reduce fill factor. The second, p-n junction PID, results from back-glass stress as alkali metal cations pile up near the CIGS surface/CdS buffer, where they reduce charge carrier concentration, open-circuit voltage, and fill factor to degrade efficiency ~160 times faster than front shunting PID.","Elsevier","","National Renewable Energy Lab.

"Using electron channeling contrast imaging to inform and improve the growth of high-efficiency GaAs solar cells on nanopatterned GaAs substrates","Mangum, John S.; Theingi, San; Neumann, Anica N.; McMahon, William E.; Warren, Emily L.","14 SOLAR ENERGY; 36 MATERIALS SCIENCE; crystalline defects; electron channeling contrast imaging; metalorganic vapor phase epitaxy; selective epitaxy; semiconducting III-V materials; solar cells","Patterned substrates provide opportunities for reducing the cost of high-efficiency III-V devices by incorporating mechanically weak layers beneficial for substrate reuse (e.g. by spalling). In this work, the functionality of electron channeling contrast imaging (ECCI) as a tool to efficiently understand and mitigate defect formation is exemplified by developing a process in which high-quality III-V material can be grown on nanopatterned GaAs substrates. Reactive ion etching used in the patterning process was found to damage the GaAs substrate surface, leading to the formation of stacking faults in the epitaxial material as observed by ECCI. Etching the patterned substrates in a 1 NH4OH: 1 H2O2: 50 DI H2O solution for 10 s prior to growth removed the substrate surface damage and stacking faults were no longer present. Growth of solar cell device structures initially produced samples with many macroscale flaws creating shunts in the devices, which complicated the assessment of material quality by device measurements. However, ECCI revealed that the epitaxial material surrounding macroscale flaws was free from any crystallographic defects such as stacking faults and threading dislocations. With this knowledge, we focused on refining the patterning process to eliminate the macroscale flaws. Solar cells were then grown on the improved nanopatterned substrates and exhibited device structures with defect densities less than 5 x 105 cm<sup>-2</sup> and average conversion efficiency of 24.8%, nearly identical to devices grown on unpatterned epi-ready substrates (25.0%).","Elsevier","","National Renewable Energy Lab.

This is because most utilities do not have secondary low-voltage system models that connect service transformers and residential customers. This is important because in many cases the main impact of interconnecting DERs could occur on the low-voltage distribution systems. This paper proposes a supervised learning method to approximate local secondary models to improve the interconnection process. The proposed supervised learning method includes a decision tree model that predicts the secondary topology and a logistic regression model that predicts conductor types. The case studies demonstrate the benefits of including secondary low-voltage circuits in the interconnection process. We report the proposed modeling methodology is readily scalable and thus can reduce the cost and effort of PV interconnection for the industry and stakeholders.","IEEE","","National Renewable Energy Lab.

They are structurally disordered, nonstoichiometric materials that have been engineered to achieve remarkably low bulk nonradiative recombination levels. Nevertheless, their performance can be further improved. This review adopts a fundamental thermodynamic perspective to comparatively assess the root causes of present limitations on CIGS PV performance. The topics of selectivity and passivation of contacts to CIGS and its multinary alloys are covered, highlighting pathways to maximizing the electrochemical potential between those contacts under illumination. Further, an overview of absorber growth methods and resulting properties is also provided. We recommend that CIGS researchers consider strategies that have been successfully implemented in the more mature wafer-based GaAs and Si PV device technologies, based on the paradigm of an idealized PV device design using an isotropic absorber with minimal nonradiative recombination, maximal light trapping, and both electron-selective and hole-selective passivated contacts. We foresee that CIGS technology will reach the 25% efficiency level within the next few years through enhanced collection and reduced recombination. To significantly impact power-generation applications, cost-effective, manufacturable solutions are also essential.","IOP Publishing","","National Renewable Energy Lab.

Probing compositional heterogeneity on length scales that has not been detected with conventional characterization techniques, we analyze the tetragonal to cubic phase transition behavior to indirectly determine the level of nanoscale compositional heterogeneity in the initial films. Further, we show that the thermal annealing conditions of the MHP layer during film processing influence the initial nanoscale compositional heterogeneity, and changing these processing conditions can be used to improve the device performance stability. The insights into structural degradation mechanisms initiated by nanoscale compositional heterogeneity and the proposed mitigation strategies will help guide the way toward long-term stable MHP solar cells.","American Chemical Society (ACS)","","SLAC National Accelerator Lab., Menlo Park, CA (United States); National Renewable Energy Lab.

We use a series of bifacial passivated emitter and rear cell (p-PERC) mini-modules with systematically varying outer cover materials (glass/glass, G/G, or glass/transparent backsheet, G/TB) and encapsulant chemistries (poly [ethylene-co-vinyl acetate], EVA; or polyolefin, POE). We study degradation modes over 1,000 hours of combined damp heat (DH) exposure and high system voltages that can cause potential-induced degradation (PID) under positive, zero, or negative 1,000 V cell-to-frame bias. We analyze the degradation modes using a combination of current-voltage measurements, impedance spectroscopy, external quantum efficiency, and spatially resolved luminescence and thermal imaging. Our results highlight various types of degradation including shunting, enhanced recombination, and series resistance increases, and we use spatially resolved characterization to separately identify the localized effects. We show that multiple PID and moisture-ingress degradation modes severely affect EVA-containing modules, with previously reported PID processes under negative-bias DH and a unique observation of rear-side surface recombination in G/EVA/G modules under positive-bias DH. We observe significantly less degradation in POE-containing modules, where the G/POE/G configuration exhibits minimal degradation under all stress conditions that we employ.","Wiley","","SLAC National Accelerator Lab., Menlo Park, CA (United States); National Renewable Energy Lab.

Current energy storage methods based on pumped storage hydropower or batteries have many limitations. Thermal energy storage (TES) has unique advantages in scale and siting flexibility to provide grid-scale storage capacity. A particle-based TES system is projected to have promising cost and performance characteristics to meet the future growing energy storage needs. This paper introduces the system and components required for particle TES to become technically and economically competitive. The system integrates electric particle heaters, particle TES within insulated concrete silos, and an efficient air-Brayton combined-cycle power system to provide power for storage durations up to several days via low-cost, high-performance storage cycles. Design specifications and cost estimation of major components in a commercial-scale system are presented in this paper. A techno-economic analysis based on preliminary component designs and performance indicates that particle TES integrated with an air-Brayton combined-cycle power system has a path to achieve the targeted levelized cost of storage of 5 ¢/kWh-cycle at a round-trip efficiency of 50% when taking low-cost energy-specific components and leveraging basic assets from existing thermal power plants. The cost model provides insights for further development and economic potentials for long-duration energy storage.","ASME","","National Renewable Energy Lab.

We demonstrate these measurement techniques using two GaInP/GaAs tandem solar cells, with a middle contact between the two subcells, as example 3T devices with both series-connected and reverse-connected subcells. Coupling mechanisms between the subcells are quantified within the context of a simple equivalent optoelectronic circuit. Electrical and optical coupling mechanisms are most clearly revealed using coupled dark measurements. These measurements are sensitive enough to observe very small luminescent coupling from the bottom subcell to the top subcell in the prototype 3T device.

To mitigate the bias, we use the Fast All-sky Radiation Model for Solar applications with DNI (FARMS-DNI) to conduct physics-based simulations of solar radiation in the circumsolar region. The DNI is quantified using the sum of the radiation along the sun direction and the scattered radiation within the circumsolar region. FARMS-DNI is coupled with the Weather Research and Forecasting model with solar extensions (WRF-Solar) to predict day-ahead DNI in 9-km pixels over an extended domain covering the contiguous United States. The DNI forecasts for the entire year of 2018 are validated using surface-based observations at the Atmospheric Radiation Measurement (ARM) and Surface Radiation Budget Network (SURFRAD) sites and a satellite-based solar radiation product developed by the procedure of the National Solar Radiation Data Base (NSRDB). The results show that the WRF-Solar coupled with the conventional Beer-Bouguer-Lambert law underestimes the overall DNI forecasts by 30%-60%, which is a joint effect of the uncertainties in computing the circumsolar radiation and forecasting cloud properties. This bias is significantly reduced by using FARMS-DNI.","Elsevier","","National Renewable Energy Lab.

"High-temperature corrosion of a nickel-based alloy in a molten chloride environment – The effect of thermal and chemical purifications","Mortazavi, Anna; Zhao, Youyang; Esmaily, Mohsen; Allanore, Antoine; Vidal, Judith; Birbilis, Nick","14 SOLAR ENERGY; 36 MATERIALS SCIENCE; cathodic protection; concentrating solar power; high-temperature corrosion; magnesium; oxidation and nitridation","There is currently an ever-increasing demand for higher process efficiencies in next generation (Gen3) concentrating solar power (CSP). Higher process efficiencies may be procured by increasing the operating temperature, and simultaneously, minimizing the degradation of materials used for construction of CSP plants (e.g., piping, thermal storage tanks, solar receivers and heat exchangers). Thus, understanding materials corrosion in the presence of molten salt mixtures used as thermal energy storage media and heat transfer fluids is indispensable for CSP development. The present paper provides insights into the effects of salt purification on the corrosion of a nickel-based alloy (Haynes 230) isothermally exposed to a stagnant chloride-based salt mixture at 800 °C. The MgCl<sub>2</sub>-based salt mixture was thermally dehydrated and chemically treated with (0.1 and 0.5 wt %) elemental magnesium. Results reveal the electrochemical nature of the corrosion process, and the formation of corrosion products such as oxides (MgO, MgCr<sub>2</sub>O<sup>4</sup>, and MgAl<sub>2</sub>O<sub>4</sub>) and nitrides (CrN) on the alloy surface and in sub-surface regions. Magnesium additions enhanced the ability to resist corrosion by reducing the concentration of impurities (H<sub>2</sub>O, MgOH<sup>+</sup>, OH<sup>-</sup> species) and polarizing the alloy surface. The formation of nitrides in all cases studied indicates the impact of using nitrogen as a protective gas in the system. Results also reveal that a single step treatment of the salt using metallic Mg could be considered as a measure to control the salt's impurity level, e.g., if required for system control.","Elsevier","","National Renewable Energy Lab.

"Exploring the design space of PV-plus-battery system configurations under evolving grid conditions","Schleifer, Anna H.; Murphy, Caitlin A.; Cole, Wesley J.; Denholm, Paul","14 SOLAR ENERGY; 25 ENERGY STORAGE; battery storage; bulk power system; hybrid renewable energy system; price-taker optimization; solar-plus-storage; utility-scale photovoltaics","In this study, we explore how the energy and capacity values of coupled systems comprising solar photovoltaic arrays and battery storage (PV-plus-battery systems) could evolve over time based on the evolution of the bulk power system. Using a price-taker model with simulated hourly energy and capacity prices projected from the present to 2050, we simulate the revenue-maximizing dispatch of a range of DC-coupled PV-plus-battery configurations in three locations in the United States. These configurations are defined by the inverter loading ratio (ILR, the ratio of the PV array capacity to the inverter capacity, which we vary from 1.4 to 2.6) and the battery-inverter ratio (BIR, the ratio of the battery power capacity to the inverter capacity, which we vary from 0.25 to 1.0). Based on each configuration's total value, we estimate the breakeven costs needed to justify each incremental increase in ILR (holding BIR constant) or BIR (holding ILR constant). We find that, in a future with low-cost renewable energy technologies, PV-plus-battery system ILRs can be economically increased to around 2.0-2.4 at a BIR of 1.0, depending on solar resource. Our results indicate that a likely evolution of PV-plus-battery system design will be increasingly greater battery power capacity to mitigate the declining PV capacity value, which will, in turn, enable increasingly higher ILRs to further increase energy value. The extent to which PV-plus-systems will be deployed with increasingly higher ILRs depends primarily on whether PV cost declines outpace declining value and increasing curtailment over time.","Elsevier","","National Renewable Energy Lab.

"Systematic Operating Temperature Differences Between Al-BSF, PERC, and PERT-With-Optimized-Rear-Reflector Solar Mini-Modules Due to Rear Reflectance","Bryan, Jonathan; Silverman, Timothy; Deceglie, Michael; Mahaffey, Mason; Firth, Peter; Holman, Zachary","14 SOLAR ENERGY; photovoltaic; silicon; solar; temperature; thermal management","Reflecting sub-bandgap light from photovoltaic modules has the potential to improve lifetime energy generation of fielded systems by reducing operating temperature. In this article, the temperature of fielded aluminum back-surface field (Al-BSF) and passivated emitter and rear contact (PERC) mini-modules was monitored every 5 minutes for 75 days along with corresponding meteorological data. Additionally, passivated emitter rear totally diffused (PERT) mini-modules with high-performance sub-bandgap rear reflectors were tested and compared to the state-of-the-art industrial modules. These reflectors consisted of a >300-nm-thick silicon dioxide nanoparticle film with a low refractive index. The impact of reflectance on measured operating temperature was isolated with a previously developed thermal model and quantified as the reflectance-induced median temperature difference between each tested module at representative outdoor conditions (1000 W m<sup>-2</sup> , 25 degrees C ambient temperature, and 1.43 m s<sup>-1</sup> wind speed). We found that, because of their reflectance differences, PERC modules ran systematically cooler than Al-BSF modules by 1.0 degrees C, whereas the PERT-with-optimized-rear-reflector systematically operated 1.4 degrees C cooler than the Al-BSF module and 0.4 degrees C than the PERC module. We also found that the rear reflector provided the greatest temperature benefit during periods of highest irradiance.","IEEE","","National Renewable Energy Lab.

In this report, we describe the results of a study in which the front faces of n-PERT cells encapsulated in polymers with a broad range of electrical resistivity were exposed to varying and controlled irradiance during PID testing. For a low resistivity ethylene-vinyl acetate copolymer encapsulant, no reduction in the rate or extent of power loss was observed for irradiance as high as 1,000 W/m<sup>2</sup>, whereas for high and intermediate resistivity polyolefin encapsulants, 100 and 300 W/m<sup>2</sup>, respectively, prevented power loss. We introduce a simple model based on charge accumulation that facilitates interpretation of these results whereby degradation via charge accumulation under voltage stress and recovery due to light exposure are opposing and interdependent phenomena that describe the susceptibility of a module to power loss.","Wiley","","National Renewable Energy Lab.

In this paper, we realize n-type conduction in SnS thin films by using radiofrequency-magnetron sputtering with Cl doping and a sulfur plasma source during deposition. Here, n-type SnS thin films are obtained at all the substrate temperatures employed in this paper (221–341 °C), exhibiting carrier concentrations and Hall mobilities of ~2 × 10<sup>18</sup> cm<sup>–3</sup> and 0.1–1cm<sup>2</sup> V<sup>–1</sup>s<sup>–1</sup>, respectively. The films prepared without a sulfur plasma source, on the other hand, exhibit p-type conduction despite containing a comparable amount of Cl donors. This is likely due to a significant number of acceptor-type defects originating from sulfur deficiency in p-type films, which appears as a broad optical absorption within the band gap. We demonstrate n-type SnS thin films in this paper for the realization of SnS homojunction solar cells, which are expected to have a higher conversion efficiency than the conventional heterojunction SnS solar cells.","American Physical Society","","National Renewable Energy Lab.

Spontaneous adsorption of aryl functional groups was observed, with surface coverages ranging from 20 to 96% depending on the native reactivity of the salt as determined by the aryl substitution pattern. Increased coverage was possible for low reactivity species using a sacrificial reductant. Functionalization was confirmed using thermogravimetric analysis, Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy, and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy. The structure and energetics of this nanocrystal electrocatalyst system, as a function of ligand coverage, were explored with density functional theory calculations. The Hammett parameter of the surface functional group was found to linearly correlate with the change in Ni and P core-electron binding energies and the nanocrystal's experimentally and computationally determined work function. The electrocatalytic activity and stability of the functionalized nanocrystals for hydrogen evolution were also improved when compared to the unfunctionalized material, but a simple trend based on electrostatics was not evident. Density functional theory was used to understand this discrepancy, revealing that H adsorption energies on the covalently functionalized Ni<sub>2</sub>P also do not follow the electrostatic trend and are predictive descriptors of the experimental results.","American Chemical Society (ACS)","","National Renewable Energy Lab.

While they have not achieved the same photovoltaic (PV) efficiencies of top-performing perovskite thin films, they do reproducibly show high open circuit voltage (V<sub>OC</sub>) in comparison. Further understanding of the V<sub>OC</sub> attainable in PQDs as a function of surface passivation, contact layers, and PQD composition will further progress the field and may lend useful lessons for non-QD perovskite solar cells. Here, we use photoluminescence-based spectroscopic techniques to understand and identify the governing physics of the V<sub>OC</sub> in CsPbI<sub>3</sub> PQDs. In particular, we probe the effect of the ligand exchange and contact interfaces on the V<sub>OC</sub> and free charge carrier concentration. The free charge carrier concentration is orders of magnitude higher than in typical perovskite thin films and could be tunable through ligand chemistry. Tuning the PQD A-site cation composition via replacement of Cs<sup>+</sup> with FA<sup>+</sup> maintains the background carrier concentration but reduces the trap density by up to a factor of 40, reducing the V<sub>OC</sub> deficit. Furthermore, these results dictate how to improve PQD optoelectronic properties and PV device performance and explain the reduced interfacial recombination observed by coupling PQDs with thin-film perovskites for a hybrid absorber layer.","American Chemical Society (ACS)","","National Renewable Energy Lab.

At either pH 0 or pH 14, etched p-GaInP electrodes corroded cathodically under illumination and formed metallic In<sup>0</sup> on the photoelectrode surface. In contrast, under the same conditions, electrodeposition of Pt facilitated the HER kinetics and stabilized p-GaInP/Pt photoelectrodes against such cathodic decomposition. When held at 0 V versus the reversible hydrogen electrode, p-GaInP/Pt electrodes in either pH = 0 or pH = 14 exhibited stable current densities (J) of ~-9 mA cm<sup>-2</sup> for hundreds of hours under simulated 1 sun illumination. During the stability tests, the current density-potential (J-E) characteristics of the p-GaInP/Pt photoelectrodes degraded due to pH-dependent changes in the surface chemistry of the photocathode.

On the other hand, while great success is being made towards improving the power conversion efficiency (PCE) of perovskite solar cells (PSCs) by cesium cation (Cs<sup>+</sup>) doping of the perovskite, more attention is being paid to the perovskite phase stabilization effect of Cs<sup>+</sup> doping, and less to other properties that are critical to understand and futher improve the PSC's. In this work, moderately-Cs-doped MAPbI<sub>3</sub> was employed as a model perovskite material in order to exclude the phase stabilization effect. Our systematic study revealed the influence of Cs<sup>+</sup> in organic-inorganic hybrid perovskites on the crystal structure, crystallization process, trap state density, band structure and charge (i.e., ions or photo-carriers) transport. Markedly, it has been observed that Cs<sup>+</sup> doping can greatly increase the carrier diffusion length in the perovskite films, thus improving the potential to scale-up PSC's.The PCE of small area devices (0.09 cm<sup>2</sup>) was increased to 21.72% from 19.73%, with decreased hysteresis behavior and increased operational stability (T85 = 1000 h) after Cs<sup>+</sup> doped, where T85 refers to the retention of 85% of the initial PCE. Moreover, a PCE of 21.08% was obtained for a Cs<sup>+</sup>-containing perovskite module with an active area > 30 cm<sup>2</sup>, which demonstrates a better ""reproducibility"" than the reference sample (MAPbI3-based perovskite modules, PCE = 18.26%).","Elsevier","","National Renewable Energy Lab.

Despite efficiency and manufacturing improvements, material demand will increase, eventually resulting in waste as deployed modules reach end of life. Circular choices for decommissioned modules could reduce waste and offset virgin materials. We present PV ICE, an open-source python framework using modern reliability data, which tracks module material flows throughout PV life cycles. We provide dynamic baselines capturing PV module and material evolution. PV ICE includes multimodal end of life, circular pathways, and manufacturing losses. We present a validation of the framework and a sensitivity analysis. Results show that manufacturing efficiencies strongly affect material demand, representing >20% of the 9 million tons of waste cumulatively expected by 2050. Reliability and circular pathways represent the best opportunities to reduce waste by 56% while maintaining installed capacity. Shorter-lived modules generate 81% more waste and reduce 2050 capacity by 6%.","Elsevier","","National Renewable Energy Lab.

Herein, the long-term degradation processes affecting advanced silicon solar cells using laboratory-based illumination and heating over hundreds of hours are investigated. The activation energy for the degradation of voltage is estimated and the degradation rates to normal solar cell operating temperature ranges are extrapolated. The cell degradation observed at high temperatures in the lab is kinetically similar to the process affecting field-deployed modules contributing to 0.37% year-1 of annualized degradation. Electroluminescence and photoluminescence mapping show that the degradation is dominated by minority carrier lifetime reduction. Suns-open-circuit voltage and light beam-induced current results indicate that the degradation could result from passivation degradation at the surface or defect formation in the near-subsurface region, leading to increased minority carrier recombination. This work highlights a long-term degradation process under elevated temperature and illumination that may continue to affect cells in an irreversible manner that is separate from recoverable light-induced degradation and light- and elevated temperature-induced degradation.","Wiley","","National Renewable Energy Lab.

Detecting tracker failures is not always straightforward; unlike other common PV system failures like inverter outages and blown fuses which take portions of a system completely offline, tracker failures only partially reduce output power and can go unnoticed as a result. Additionally, tracker failures can take one of several forms, each with their own loss characteristics. Here we present two methods of detecting tracker failure events from time-series production data and a method for estimating the associated production loss. Compared with existing detection methods, the proposed power-based detection method showed 0-17% reductions in Type I error rate depending on weather conditions. Here, the loss model estimated production loss with low error (mean bias error = -2.3 %, root-mean-squared error = 6%) in a rudimentary validation.","IEEE","","National Renewable Energy Lab.

Solution phase deposition of all active layers lends itself to roll-to-roll fabrication methods which are well-established and have production rates of several hundred square meters per minute. In this techno-economic analysis, the opportunity to scale at this production throughput is considered with manufacturing rates exceeding one gigawatt per year in a single plant. Intense pulsed light is used for the post deposition process to minimize costs associated with the footprint, equipment, and operation. The analysis is limited to the operation of a roll-to-roll manufacturing facility producing a perovskite solar film that can be incorporated into photovoltaic modules. Costs associated with materials, labor, and equipment are considered along with utilities determined from the fundamental engineering calculations. Furthermore, the results show that at very large-scale operations of several gigawatts, the costs to produce the solar films range between $0.04-$0.10 per watt.","Elsevier","","Univ. of Louisville, KY (United States); National Renewable Energy Lab.

The well-documented dynamic response of perovskite solar cells to an external applied voltage has led to the development of steady-state performance measurement methods; however, these methods have not been widely adopted by the perovskite PV community. A key reason for this is that steady-state measurement methods take tens of minutes to complete, as opposed to conventional ""fast"" current-voltage (I-V) measurements usually lasting a few seconds. Fast I-Vs arise from a snapshot, almost always not a steady-state condition of the device; however, given their widespread use, the question arises: how do performance parameters of perovskite PV compare when measured with fast I-V and with a steady-state method? Results compiled from approximately 200 perovskite PV cells, including single junction, and two-terminal perovskite-perovskite and perovskite-Si tandems, show that fast I-Vs can provide a useful measure of the open-circuit voltage of the devices, while the short-circuit current and the overall efficiency can be widely misestimated. Here, the implications of these findings on performance testing protocols are discussed and possible options for fast and accurate testing of perovskite PV are proposed.","Wiley","","National Renewable Energy Lab.

Concern has also emerged regarding the recyclability of modules and their component materials, including fluoropolymer-based backsheets. Laminated polyethylene-terephthalate (PET) core backsheets have traditionally been used in the PV industry, but new, coextruded polyolefin (PO) backsheets show promise as an improved alternative. In this work, minimodule and coupon samples of seven different backsheets (made of layers including contemporary PET and fluoropolymers, novel PO, and polyamide materials) were run through hygrometric- or UV photolytic-accelerated aging to identify and better understand each material's degradation modes and the backsheets' field reliability. In addition to the artificial aging, the natural weathering methods used in this article are described. The comprehensive set of chemical, mechanical, and structural characterizations at intermittent read points in this article is presented, including: visual appearance and color; gloss; mechanical tensile testing; I-V performance; electroluminescence (EL) imaging; dielectric breakdown; Fourier-transform infrared-chemical structure; X-ray-polymer structure; and differential scanning calorimetry-crystalline content.

"Modeling of Combined Lead Fast Reactor and Concentrating Solar Power Supercritical Carbon Dioxide Cycles to Demonstrate Feasibility, Efficiency Gains, and Cost Reductions","White, Brian T.; Wagner, Michael J.; Neises, Ty; Stansbury, Cory; Lindley, Ben","14 SOLAR ENERGY; Supercritical carbon dioxide Brayton cycle; concentrating solar power (CSP); lead fast reactor (LFR); cogeneration; complimentary cycle; thermal energy storage (TES)","Solar power has innate issues with weather, grid demand and time of day, which can be mitigated through use of thermal energy storage for concentrating solar power (CSP). Nuclear reactors, including lead-cooled fast reactors (LFRs), can adjust power output according to demand; but with high fixed costs and low operating costs, there may not be sufficient economic incentive to make this worthwhile. We investigate potential synergies through coupling CSP and LFR together in a single supercritical CO<sub>2</sub> Brayton cycle and/or using the same thermal energy storage. Combining these cycles allows for the LFR to thermally charge the salt storage in the CSP cycle during low-demand periods to be dispatched when grid demand increases. The LFR/CSP coupling into one cycle is modeled to find the preferred location of the LFR heat exchanger, CSP heat exchanger, sCO<sub>2</sub>-to-salt heat exchanger (C2S), turbines, and recuperators within the supercritical CO<sub>2</sub> Brayton cycle. Three cycle configurations have been studied: two-cycle configuration, which uses CSP and LFR heat for dedicated turbocompressors, has the highest efficiencies but with less component synergies; a combined cycle with CSP and LFR heat sources in parallel is the simplest with the lowest efficiencies; and a combined cycle with separate high-temperature recuperators for both the CSP and LFR is a compromise between efficiency and component synergies. Additionally, four thermal energy storage charging techniques are studied: the turbine positioned before C2S, requiring a high LFR outlet temperature for viability; the turbine after the C2S, reducing turbine inlet temperature and therefore power; the turbine parallel to the C2S producing moderate efficiency; and a dedicated circulator loop. While all configurations have pros and cons, use of a single cycle offers component synergies with limited efficiency penalty. Using a turbine in parallel with the C2S heat exchanger is feasible but results in a low charging efficiency, while a dedicated circulator loop offers flexibility and near-perfect heat storage efficiency but increasing cost with additional cycle components.","MDPI","","Univ. of Wisconsin, Madison, WI (United States); National Renewable Energy Lab.

Efficient CO<sub>2</sub>RR can be used to replace fossil fuels as well as repurpose captured CO<sub>2</sub>, while new NRR pathways can be used to supplement or replace the energy intensive Haber–Bosch process for NH<sub>3</sub> generation with no CO<sub>2</sub> emissions. Therefore, this review article focuses on (photo)electrocatalytic and photocatalytic conversion of CO<sub>2</sub> and N<sub>2</sub> molecules into useful products, such as carbon monoxide, methanol, formic acid, and ammonia, using 2D transition metal dichalcogenides (TMDCs) and metal carbides/nitrides (MXenes). Additionally, these highly tunable 2D catalysts will be evaluated for their ability to selectively and efficiently undergo CO<sub>2</sub>RR and NRR by controlling defects, phases, edge sites, interfaces, and functional groups. We first address the CO<sub>2</sub>RR and NRR challenges, with a particular focus on theoretical mechanisms and minimum energy pathways. We follow this discussion with a detailed review of state-of-the-art 2D TMDC and MXene experimental catalysts for CO<sub>2</sub>RR and NRR (photo)electrocatalytic and photocatalytic reactions, and then address areas of opportunity for these catalytic reactions.","Royal Society of Chemistry","","National Renewable Energy Lab.

A much larger performance drop was observed for reconstructed arsenic-doped devices, which was attributed to insufficient emitter doping, formation of compensating defects at the front interface, and increased sensitivity to both effects due to a collapsed depletion region. This work highlights key challenges unique to highly doped CdSeTe:As devices that must be addressed moving forward.","American Chemical Society","","National Renewable Energy Lab.

We have developed a custom optical mapping instrument (OMI) to improve measurement throughput time, facilitate automated measurements, allow for localized specimen examination, obtain spatial information relative to commercial benchtop spectrophotometer instruments, and provide automated data analysis. Both the key components and the methods used to improve the measurements are described. The measurement precision for the OMI is benchmarked for hemispherical transmittance relative to a previous round-robin study for commercial spectrophotometers. In addition to the unique instrument developed in this study, new insights have emerged from the examination of specimens from previous experiments, including: the depletion of the UV absorber is revealed for specimens beyond a certain size after artificial ultraviolet (UV) weathering; an optical degradation by internal haze formation is confirmed following Damp Heat (85 °C/85% relative humidity) testing; the better uniformity of the wear pattern for falling sand abrasion is used to select the DIN 52348 fixture over the ASTM D968 fixture; and the greater local (in the order of millimeters) heterogeneity of surface contamination in the soiling-prone location of Dubai relative to Kuwait. The results of the UV study have already been used to improve the standardized weathering of encapsulants. The example for Damp Heat testing is given to increase awareness of a degradation believed to be ubiquitously occurring in safety and design-type qualification testing of PV modules.","IEEE","","National Renewable Energy Lab.

Presented here is a series of polymers based on a one-pot polymerization of aryl dihalides with primary aryl amines to produce solution-processable polymers in high yield, with simple purification, and promising properties for high performing P-I-N PSC devices. How these properties can be tuned by careful selection of the reactant chemical moieties is discussed. Through this strategy, a wide range of relevant properties such as glass transition temperature, highest occupied molecular orbital tuning, and polydispersity are explored. When implemented into devices using a triple-cation FAMACs perovskite active layer, the hole transport material series shows average power conversion efficiencies (PCE) in excess of 17%, which is comparable to controls using state-of-the-art poly(triarylamine).

We generate mesopores in (100) Ge by bipolar electrochemical etching and anneal them at high temperature. The pores coalesce deep in the structure rather than at the surface as desired, although resulting in coarse superficial morphology unsuitable for device growth. To combat this issue, we developed a surface treatment involving an HBr dip, annealing at 415 degrees C, and a postannealing ultrasonic De-ionized water dip to improve the surface structure, resulting in a smoother reformed surface on which we grow a GaInAs solar cell. The structure retains embedded pores after growth and the transitions between Ge and III-V layers are distinct. The solar cell fabricated using the improved coalescence has an efficiency of 4.5%. The efficiency improves to 7.7% by isolating the rest of the device from three limiting localized shunt areas. Protruding defects in the porous Ge and III-V layers still limit the performance, but this work establishes a step toward the technical viability of this exfoliation approach, showing decent efficiency if protruding defects can be removed or reduced.","IEEE","","National Renewable Energy Lab.

Early studies provided initial guidance and revealed several intriguing questions that more recent developments, in terms of both expanded and diversified compositional tuning and more sophisticated characterization, have begun to answer. These questions center around the delicate interplay between physical and electronic structure that is perturbed by choice of perovskite structural motif and organic spacer properties. In addition to their distinct natures, the energy offsets between the metal-halide and molecular excitons can be leveraged for a variety of unique effects and emergent properties, including fast interlayer energy transfer.

However, achieving a stable form of a-FAPbI<sub>3</sub> where both the composition and the phase are pure is very challenging. In this work, we report on a combined strategy of precursor engineering and grain anchoring to successfully prepare methylammonium (MA)-free and phase-pure stable a-FAPbI<sub>3</sub> films. The incorporation of volatile FA-based additives in the precursor solutions completely suppresses the formation of non-perovskite d-FAPbI<sub>3</sub> during film crystallization. Grains of the desired a-phase are anchored together and stabilized when 4-tert-butylbenzylammonium iodide is permeated into the a-FAPbI<sub>3</sub> film interior via grain boundaries. This cooperative scheme leads to a significantly increased efficiency close to 21% for FAPbI<sub>3</sub> perovskite solar cells.

Time-resolved photoluminescence (TRPL) has conventionally been used to evaluate recombination, but carrier redistribution often dominates the response at short times. In this work, we report on the quantification of carrier dynamics and recombination mechanisms by complementary use of both time-resolved terahertz spectroscopy (TRTS) and TRPL combined with numerical modeling of the continuity equations and Poisson’s equation. We have demonstrated this approach using CdTe thin films. A thin film stack with CdTe fabricated by vapor transport deposition and treated with CdCl<sub>2</sub> exhibited a bulk lifetime of 1.7 ± 0.1 ns, negligible CdTe/CdS interface recombination velocity, and back surface recombination velocity of 6.3 ± 1.3 x10<sup>4</sup> cm/s. In contrast, a film stack without CdCl<sub>2</sub> treatment had a bulk lifetime of only 68 ± 12 ps and a higher interface recombination velocity of 4 ± 2 x10<sup>8</sup> cm/s. By determining the locus and mechanisms of performance-limiting recombination, we can accelerate the development of thin-film PVs with higher V<sub>oc</sub> and efficiency. While the method has been demonstrated here using CdTe, it is also applicable to perovskites, Cu(InGa)Se<sub>2</sub>, Cu2ZnSn(S,Se)<sub>4,</sub> and emerging technologies.","American Institute of Physics (AIP)","","Drexel Univ., Philadelphia, PA (United States); National Renewable Energy Lab.

However, the presence of TCOs is disadvantageous to the development of flexible OIHP-SCs due to the brittle nature of ITO which is easily breakable during bending. Herein, a flexible TCO-free OIHP-SC is demonstrated by using lithium bis(trifluoromethane)sulfonimide (Li-TFSI) as a codopant for the single-layer graphene transparent conducting electrode and poly(triarylamine) hole-transporting material (HTM) on a flexible polydimethylsiloxane substrate. The optical and electrical properties of the Li-TFSI-doped graphene substrate are measured by controlling the doping amount and the best conditions for charge extraction are established at a doping concentration of 20 mm Li-TFSI, thus optimizing the device photovoltaic performance. As a result, a highest power conversion efficiency of 19.01% is demonstrated by the flexible TCO-free OIHP-SC devices with an active area of 1 cm<sup>2</sup>.

We compare radiative voltage, radiative efficiency, and carrier lifetime for Cu-doped CdSe/CdTe solar cells and for undoped polycrystalline CdSeTe heterostructures passivated with Al_2O_3. Using external quantum efficiency spectrum and a CdSeTe absorption spectrum obtained from absolute photoluminescence (PL), we show that the radiative voltage is greater than 1.1 V. Time-resolved PL experiments and modeling show that a major part of voltage losses can be attributed to recombination in the absorber bulk. The front interface recombination makes a larger impact within the first few nanoseconds after pulsed excitation, and the comparison of time-gated and time-integrated PL can be used to assess relative contributions of front interface and bulk recombination rates.","IEEE","","National Renewable Energy Lab.

"Tracking Soiling Losses: Assessment, Uncertainty, and Challenges in Mapping","Micheli, Leonardo; Smestad, Greg P.; Bessa, Joao Gabriel; Muller, Matthew; Fernandez, Eduardo F.; Almonacid, Florencia","14 SOLAR ENERGY; air quality; particulate matter; photovoltaic; soiling","Several models have been presented in the recent years to estimate the magnitude of soiling from environmental parameters. However, these models are often based on data from a single site, or at most a few sites, and only limited data are, as of yet, available on their uncertainty. The present work aims to present a first comparative analysis of soiling estimation models, using measured soiling data from various locations in the USA. The study also investigates the impact that the source of the input data can have on the estimation. The results show that the model selection is only one of the factors that can affect the evaluation. Indeed, the use of satellite-derived or ground-mounted particulate matter data can lead to the generation of different soiling maps, with factors greater than 2x between the modeled losses. The current challenges and the unanswered questions that can bias soiling estimation are discussed. Additionally, potential research directions to improve the quality of soiling modeling are identified.","IEEE","","National Renewable Energy Lab.

"The nanoscale distribution of copper and its influence on charge collection in CdTe solar cells","Walker, Trumann; Stuckelberger, Michael E.; Nietzold, Tara; Mohan-Kumar, Niranjana; Ossig, Christina; Kahnt, Maik; Wittwer, Felix; Lai, Barry; Salomon, Damien; Colegrove, Eric; Bertoni, Mariana I.","14 SOLAR ENERGY; CdTe doping; charge collection; copper diffusion; X-ray beam induced current; X-ray flourescence; X-ray fluorescence","For decades, Cu has been the primary dopant in CdTe photovoltaic absorbers. Typically, Cu acceptor concentrations in these devices are on the order of 1 1014 cm-3, which has made it notoriously difficult to directly correlate nanoscale Cu distributions to the local charge transport properties of these devices. To measure and correlate these properties, measurement techniques require high sensitivity to elemental concentration, large penetration depth, and operando compatibility. Techniques such as secondary-ion mass spectroscopy and X-ray energy dispersive spectroscopy are widely adopted to measure Cu concentrations, but they are limited by penetration depth, sensitivity, or spatial resolution. Additionally, they lack the operando capabilities required to correlate one-to-one Cu concentrations to electrical performance. In this work, correlative X-ray microscopy is used to investigate the spatial distribution of Cu and its impact on charge collection through the depth and breadth of CdTe photovoltaic devices. Plan-view, nanoscale X-ray fluorescence maps clearly demonstrate the spatial segregation of copper around regions thought to be CdTe grain boundaries. Complementary cross-section imaging unveils the transition of the maximum charge-collection efficiency from the ZnTe-CdTe interface to the CdS-CdTe interface as a function of Cu incorporation. The copper concentration through the depth of the CdTe layer is characterized by slow and fast diffusion components, and cross-section charge-transport modeling shows that the experimentally obtained charge collection can be explained by the modeled acceptor distribution through the depth of the CdTe layer.","Elsevier","","National Renewable Energy Lab.

"Exciton–Phonon Coupling and Carrier Relaxation in PbS Quantum Dots: The Case of Carboxylate Ligands","Kennehan, Eric R.; Munson, Kyle T.; Grieco, Christopher; Doucette, Grayson S.; Marshall, Ashley R.; Beard, Matthew C.; Asbury, John B.","37 INORGANIC, ORGANIC, PHYSICAL, AND ANALYTICAL CHEMISTRY; 14 SOLAR ENERGY; Quantum dots; Light absorption; Ligands; Excited states; Nanocrystals; Carrier dynamics; Ligand chemistry; QDs; Solar-photochemistry","Some ligand-nanocrystal combinations exhibit rapid cooling of highly excited electronic states while other nanocrystal/shell combinations do not appear to have this effect. There remains a need to identify the distinguishing properties of ligand-nanocrystal interactions that avoid such rapid relaxation processes to guide the design of colloidal quantum dots (QDs) that take advantage of multiple exciton generation or hot-carrier extraction processes. Here, we use mid-infrared transient absorption spectroscopy to investigate the influence that carboxylate ligands with distinct excited state surface chemistries has on exciton-phonon coupling and hot exciton relaxation in PbS quantum dot (QD) films. Our findings reveal that despite significant differences in the excited state surface chemistry of oleate (OA) and iodide/mercaptopropionic acid (I-/MPA) ligands, PbS QD films passivated with both ligand types exhibit identical electronic relaxation rates and exciton-phonon coupling strengths within experimental precision. The data suggest that the inorganic lattice is the principal source of exciton-phonon coupling that influences hot exciton relaxation, rather than the vibronic modes of carboxylate ligands. The size-dependent nature of the exciton-phonon coupling strength is consistent with the localization of charge on the QD surfaces, which enhances the mixing of electronic and nuclear coordinates particularly when the electronic states are more quantum confined in smaller nanocrystals.","American Chemical Society","","Pennsylvania State Univ., University Park, PA (United States); National Renewable Energy Lab.

"Using concentrating-solar-power plants as economic carbon-free capacity resources","Yagi, Kejiro; Sioshansi, Ramteen; Denholm, Paul","14 SOLAR ENERGY; 24 POWER TRANSMISSION AND DISTRIBUTION; concentrating solar power; CSP; energy storage; peaking resource","Deep decarbonization of electricity systems raises concerns about the need for generating capacity that can maintain reliable energy supply. Given this concern, we explore the ability of concentrating-solar-power plants with thermal energy storage to provide a carbon-free source of such capacity. We develop an approach to assessing the capacity contribution of concentrating-solar-power plants that considers future systems. Such considerations are important, because of potential differences in net-load patterns compared to today (e.g., due to higher renewable-energy penetrations). Using historical data spanning an 18-year period, we demonstrate that concentrating-solar-power plants with thermal energy storage can provide this necessary capacity with little impact on their financial viability. We examine the impact of myopic decisions and imperfect foresight of future system conditions on the operation of concentrating-solar-power plants and the resultant impact on their capacity contributions. We find that imperfect foresight can have limited impacts on such a use of concentrating-solar-power plants, so long as proper forecasting techniques are developed and used. Overall, our work shows that concentrating-solar-power plants with thermal energy storage may have a role to play in delivering reliable electricity supply in a decarbonized energy system.","Elsevier","","National Renewable Energy Lab.

"Engineering the reciprocal space for ultrathin GaAs solar cells","Buencuerpo, Jeronimo; Llorens, Jose M.; Ripalda, Jose M.; Steiner, Myles A.; Tamboli, Adele C.","14 SOLAR ENERGY; III-V; reciprocal space; ultrathin solar cell; Fourier space; solar cell; PV","III-V solar cells dominate the high efficiency charts, but with significantly higher cost than other solar cells. Ultrathin III-V solar cells can exhibit lower production costs and immunity to short carrier diffusion lengths caused by radiation damage, dislocations, or native defects. Nevertheless, solving the incomplete optical absorption of sub-micron layers presents a challenge for light-trapping structures. Simple photonic crystals have high diffractive efficiencies, which are excellent for narrow-band applications. Random structures offer a broadband response instead but suffer from low diffraction efficiencies. Quasirandom (hyperuniform) structures lie in between, providing high diffractive efficiency over a target wavelength range, which is broader than simple photonic crystals, but narrower than a random structure. In this work, we present a design method to evolve a simple photonic crystal into a quasirandom structure by modifying the spatial-Fourier space in a controlled manner. We apply these structures to an ultrathin GaAs solar cell of only 100 nm. We predict a photocurrent for the tested quasirandom structure of 25.3 mA/cm2, while a planar structure would be limited to 16.1 mA/cm2. The modified spatial-Fourier space in the quasirandom structure increases the amount of resonances, with a progression from discrete number of peaks to a continuum in the absorption. The enhancement in photocurrent is stable under angle variations because of this continuum. We also explore the robustness against changes in the real-space distribution of the quasirandom structures using different numerical seeds, simulating variations in a self-assembly method. We observe a standard deviation of the quasirandom structures of only 0.3 mA/cm2. The approach presented here can be applied to guide future optimizations and experimental design and fabrication of new classes of photonic crystals for GaAs and other ultrathin solar cells.","Elsevier","","National Renewable Energy Lab.

Although efforts are made to improve the lifetime of perovskite PV devices, their degradation under reverse-bias conditions is barely addressed. Herein, perovskite solar cells with carbon-based electrodes are presented which demonstrate superior resilience against reverse-bias-induced degradation. Although their breakdown voltage is identified to be at approximately -3.6 V, cells do not degrade until the applied reverse-bias exceeds -9 V. Two main degradation mechanisms are identified: 1) iodine loss due to hole tunneling into perovskite, which takes place even at low reverse-bias but decomposes the perovskite only after long time durations; and 2) rapid heating at large reverse-bias leading to formation of PbI2, which starts at shunts and then follows the path of the least resistance for the cell current, which is primarily influenced by the electrode sheet resistances. Finally, perovskite solar modules with carbon-based electrodes are demonstrated, which are subjected to a ""hotspot"" test described in the IEC 61215:2016 international standard at an accredited module testing laboratory. Passing this accelerated test for the first time confirms the superior stability of perovskite PV devices with carbon-based electrodes and highlights their large industrialization potential.","Wiley","","National Renewable Energy Lab.

The exchange reactions become significantly more favorable for both electron donating and withdrawing ligands (..delta..G becomes more negative) in the smaller QDs compared to the larger QDs likely because the ligand density is smaller on the larger QDs reducing the strength of the ligand-ligand interactions. We found that Janus-ligand shells form more readily on smaller QDs than on bigger QDs with electron donating ligands. We also observed a dependence on the QD concentration that should be considered when forming Janus-ligand shells. Two-dimensional solution nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy (2D-NMR) shows evidence of pronounced phase segregation between oleate and electron donating ligands on the smaller QDs consistent with the enhanced ligand-ligand interactions.

This paper presents the details of the development of a data-enhanced hierarchical control (DEHC) architecture and the results of its evaluation. The DEHC is a hybrid control framework that enables the efficient, reliable, and secure operation of distribution grids with extremely high penetrations of solar photovoltaic (PV) generation by seamlessly integrating centralized utility controls, distributed controls for DERs, and autonomous grid-edge controls. In the DEHC architecture, the advanced distribution management system (ADMS) controls the legacy devices (such as load tap changers and capacitor banks), the PV smart inverters are dispatched by real-time optimal power flow, and the grid-edge devices regulate local voltages in coordination with each other. The DEHC is demonstrated using a commercial ADMS platform, real utility distribution feeder models, and grid-edge devices. The performance of the DEHC architecture is evaluated using simulations and hardware-in-the-loop experiments with voltage regulation as the control objective. The results show that the DEHC enables high penetration levels of PV in distribution feeders by effectively managing system voltages through the synergistic operation of ADMS, distributed PV smart inverter controls, and secondary-level grid-edge device control.","Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers","","National Renewable Energy Lab.

"Reconciling the Driving Force and the Barrier to Charge Separation in Donor–Nonfullerene Acceptor Films","Allen, Taylor G.; Kafourou, Panagiota; Larson, Bryon W.; Heeney, Martin; Reid, Obadiah G.; Rumbles, Garry","14 SOLAR ENERGY; nonfullerene acceptors; organic photovoltaics; organic semiconductors; photoinduced electron transfer; solar-photochemistry; time-resolved microwave conductivity","We investigate the dependence of charge yields on the driving force for photoinduced electron transfer in a series of all-small-molecule, semiconducting films made from indacenodithiophene nonfullerene acceptors (IDT NFAs). In contrast to reports of efficient, barrierless charge separation at near zero driving force for NFA-containing organic photovoltaics, we find that barrierless charge separation occurs only if the driving force is sufficient to overcome the Coulomb potential, =300 meV, based on time-resolved microwave conductivity and PL quenching measurements of 5 mmolal sensitized and 700 mmolal blended films comprising IDT NFAs paired with three different donors. This discrepancy with recent literature is caused by a difference in the way that we calculate driving force. Far from being semantic, the driving force calculation is crucial because its value controls the mechanisms needed to explain experimental observations. We provide a candid assessment of the uncertainties for our methods and popular ones used in the literature and emphasize the importance of standardizing methods across this field.","American Chemical Society (ACS)","","National Renewable Energy Lab.

The impacts could be mitigated by module recycling, repair and reuse; however, previous studies of PV circularity omit the consideration of critical social factors. Here we used an agent-based model to integrate social aspects with techno-economic factors, which provides a more realistic assessment of the circularity potential for previously studied interventions that assesses additional interventions that cannot be analysed using techno-economic analysis alone. We also performed a global sensitivity analysis using a machine-learning metamodel. We show that to exclude social factors underestimates the effect of lower recycling prices on PV material circularity, which highlights the relevance of considering social factors in future studies. Interventions aimed at changing customer attitudes about used PV boost the reuse of modules, although used modules can only satisfy one-third of the US demand during 2020–2050, which suggests that reuse should be complemented by recycling.","Nature Publishing Group","","National Renewable Energy Lab.

However, few studies have focused explicitly on high-quality devices grown over patterned substrates, which is required for any cost saving to be beneficial. In this work, we demonstrate the growth of high-efficiency GaAs solar cells on GaAs substrates patterned with an array of nanoscale SiOX mask stripes. We show that reducing the pattern dimensions to submicron length scales with nanoimprint lithography enables defect-free coalescence. By varying the growth conditions, faceting of the epilayer material during overgrowth of the patterned mask was also controlled. A V/III ratio of 200 during MOVPE overgrowth produced smooth coalesced epilayers, which is desirable for the growth of subsequent device layers. Inverted GaAs front homojunction devices grown on patterned GaAs(001) substrates achieved threading dislocation densities below 5 × 10<sup>5</sup> cm<sup>–2</sup> and maintained >23% solar cell efficiencies at one sun illumination, equivalent to control devices grown on unpatterned epi-ready substrates.","American Chemical Society","","National Renewable Energy Lab.

"A Multi-modal Approach to Understanding Degradation of Organic Photovoltaic Materials","Anderson, Michael A.; Larson, Bryon W.; Ratcliff, Erin L.","14 SOLAR ENERGY; aesthetic; degradation; morphological stability; organic photovoltaics; performance; absorption; oxygen; materials; x-ray photoelectron spectroscopy","State-of-the-art organic photovoltaic (OPV) materials are composed of complex, chemically diverse polymeric and molecular structures that form highly intricate solid-state interactions, collectively yielding exceptional tunability in performance and aesthetics. These properties are especially attractive for semitransparent power-generating windows or shades in living environments, greenhouses, or other architectural integrations. However, before such a future is realized, a broader and deeper understanding of property stability must be acquired. Stability during operating and environmental conditions is critical, namely, material color steadfastness, optoelectronic performance retention, morphological rigidity, and chemical robustness. To date, no single investigation encompasses all four distinct, yet interconnected, metrics. Here, we present a multimodal strategy that captures a dynamic and interconnected evolution of each property during the course of an accelerated photobleaching experiment. We demonstrate this approach across relevant length scales (from molecular to visual macroscale) using X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy, grazing-incidence X-ray scattering, microwave conductivity, and time-dependent photobleaching spectroscopies for two high-performance semitransparent OPV blends—PDPP4T:PC<sub>60</sub>BM and PDPP4T:IEICO-4F, with comparisons to the stabilities of the individual components. We present direct evidence that specific molecular acceptor (fullerene vs nonfullerene) designs and the resulting donor–acceptor interactions lead to distinctly different mechanistic routes that ultimately arrive at what is termed “OPV degradation.” We directly observe a chemical oxidation of the cyano endcaps of the IEICO-4F that coincides with a morphological change and large loss in photoconductivity while the fullerene acceptor-containing blend demonstrates a significantly greater fraction of oxygen uptake but retains 55% of the photoconductivity. Finally, this experimental roadmap provides meaningful guidance for future high-throughput, multimodal studies, benchmarking the sensitivity of the different analytical techniques for assessing stability in printable active layers, independent of complete device architectures.","American Chemical Society (ACS)","","National Renewable Energy Lab.

The fill factor of IBC solar cells is strongly affected by the electrical isolation region between n- and p-type fingers, as this region is critical in minimizing shunting losses. During fabrication of monocrystalline Si solar cells with poly-Si passivating contacts, the intrinsic poly-Si isolation region inevitably gets contaminated with both p- and n-type dopants. Using dopant profiles measured with time-of-flight secondary ion mass spectrometry and scanning probe measurements of the isolation region, we demonstrate that despite the dopant spreading during cell processing, a well-compensated region between the doped fingers exists that prevents shunting. The trap-assisted dopant compensation mechanism significantly widens the compensated region to tens of microns, where the residual dopant densities are below the trap density. This enables a high-resistivity region, resulting in low shunt current. Using one-dimensional (1-D) finite element diode simulations, we identify the design parameters and experimental conditions under which a sufficiently resistive region can form. Furthermore, our measurements of 2-D local resistivity and work function maps across the isolation region using scanning spreading resistance microscopy and Kelvin probe force microscopy demonstrate the existence of a highly resistive, wide compensated region and confirm our proposed compensation mechanism. For our structures, this region is ~25 µm in width within a ~150 µm wide finger isolation region with nearly 3 orders of magnitude higher resistivity than the regions dominated by a single type of dopant.","American Chemical Society (ACS)","","National Renewable Energy Lab.

The compositional dependence of the crystal structure and optical properties of Cd(Se,Te) are examined.

Cross-sectional TEM/EDS, photoluminescence spectra and secondary ion mass spectroscopy analysis confirmed the formation of a graded Se profile toward the back contact with a diffusion length of ~1.5 um and revealed back-diffusion of Group V (As) dopants from the CdTe layer into Cd(Se,Te) grains. Due to the strong Se/Te interdiffusion, CdSe in the Se bilayer configuration was unable to form an n-type emitter layer in processed devices.

The minority carrier lifetime of boron-doped Cz Si decreases upon exposure to light due to B–O-related defects, which reduce the performance of ~10<sup>9</sup> solar modules worldwide. Using electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR), we have identified the spin-active paramagnetic signatures of this phenomenon and gained insights into its microscopic mechanism. We found a distinct defect signature, which diminished when the degraded sample was annealed. The second signature, a broad magnetic field spectrum, due to the unionized B acceptors, was present in the annealed state but vanished upon light exposure. These observations show that, on degradation, nearly all the ~10<sup>16</sup> cm<sup>–3</sup> B atoms in Cz Si complexed with interstitial O atoms, whereas only ~10<sup>12</sup> cm<sup>–3</sup> of these complexes created defects that were recombination-active.

"A non-intrusive optical approach to characterize heliostats in utility-scale power tower plants: Flight path generation/optimization of unmanned aerial systems","Farrell, Tucker; Guye, Kidus; Mitchell, Rebecca; Zhu, Guangdong","14 SOLAR ENERGY; concentrating solar power; heliostat optical errors; unmanned aerial system","A newly developed in situ non-intrusive optical (NIO) approach has been developed to survey various types of heliostat optical errors for a concentrating solar power (CSP) tower plant. To measure mirror surface slope error, facet canting error, and heliostat tracking error at a sub-milliradian accuracy, NIO requires several reflection images scanned over each individual heliostat. For a utility-scale plant that typically includes more than 10,000 heliostats, an unmanned aerial system (UAS) is crucial for efficient implementation of the NIO method. Here, we develop a flight path generation/optimization algorithm to plan more efficient UAS paths to collect NIO data over a utility-scale heliostat field.

"Glass/glass photovoltaic module reliability and degradation: a review","Sinha, Archana; Sulas-Kern, Dana B.; Owen-Bellini, Michael; Spinella, Laura; Ulicna, Sona; Ayala Pelaez, Silvana; Johnston, Steve; Schelhas, Laura T.","14 SOLAR ENERGY; accelerated test; bifacial; characterization; degradation; DuraMAT; glass/glass; transparent backsheet","Glass/glass (G/G) photovoltaic (PV) module construction is quickly rising in popularity due to increased demand for bifacial PV modules, with additional applications for thin-film and building-integrated PV technologies. G/G modules are expected to withstand harsh environmental conditions and extend the installed module lifespan to greater than 30 years compared to conventional glass/backsheet (G/B) modules. With the rapid growth of G/G deployment, understanding the outdoor performance, degradation, and reliability of this PV module construction becomes highly valuable. In this review, we present the history of G/G modules that have existed in the field for the past 20 years, their subsequent reliability issues under different climates, and methods for accelerated testing and characterization of both cells and packaging materials. We highlight some general trends of G/G modules, such as greater degradation when using poly(ethylene-co-vinyl acetate) (EVA) encapsulants, causing the industry to move toward polyolefin-based encapsulants. Transparent backsheets have also been introduced as an alternative to the rear glass for decreasing the module weight and aiding the effusion of trapped gaseous degradation products in the laminate. New amendments to IEC 61215 standard protocols for G/G bifacial modules have also been proposed so that the rear side power generation and UV exposure will be standardized. We further summarize a suite of destructive and non-destructive characterization techniques, such as current-voltage scans, module electro-optical imaging, adhesion tests, nanoscale structural/chemical investigation, and forensic analysis, to provide deeper insights into the fundamental properties of the module materials degradation and how it can be monitored in the G/G construction. This will set the groundwork for future research and product development.","IOP Publishing","","National Renewable Energy Lab.

"Surface albedo spatial variability in North America: Gridded data vs. local measurements","Gueymard, Christian A.; Lara-Fanego, Vicente; Sengupta, Manajit; Habte, Aron","14 SOLAR ENERGY; gridded data; local measurements; National Solar Radiation Database; North America; NRSRD; spatial variability; surface albedo","Considering the current booming interest for the large-scale deployment of bifacial photovoltaic modules, the solar industry now requires accurate estimates of broadband surface albedo at high spatial resolution. In this context, the present study evaluates the adequacy and performance over North America of two Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) white-sky albedo products (at 500-m and 1-km resolution) and the National Solar Radiation Database (NSRDB) product at 4-km resolution. Two variations of the 500-m MODIS product are also considered: black-sky albedo and all-sky albedo. Albedo observations from 36 radiometric stations during 2011–2015 are analyzed while considering the apparent homogeneity of the surface characteristics over the 4x4 km NSRDB pixel in which they are located. Even at sites where the albedo around the station has been found “homogeneous” in the literature, marked differences are found between the daily observations and the gridded estimates at any spatial resolution. Furthermore, differences in seasonal behavior and between the three different albedo types also impact the accuracy of the albedo estimates, with overtones caused by local specificities and inhomogeneities. All this precludes the desirable evaluation of the local albedo at a specific site of relatively small size compared to its corresponding 4x4-km pixel if only the mean albedo over that pixel is known. Significant discrepancies are also found at snow-impacted sites, most importantly in the case of the NSRDB albedo estimates, which are typically much too high.","Elsevier","","National Renewable Energy Lab.

"Failure Analysis of a New Polyamide-Based Fluoropolymer-Free Backsheet After Combined-Accelerated Stress Testing","Ulicna, Sona; Sinha, Archana; Springer, Martin; Miller, David C.; Hacke, Peter; Schelhas, Laura T.; Owen-Bellini, Michael","14 SOLAR ENERGY; backsheet; combined-accelerated stress testing; durability; DuraMAT; polyamide","The viability of novel coextruded, fluoropolymer-free backsheets for photovoltaic (PV) modules has been questioned as a result of a large number of early-life backsheet failures in PV installations containing one of the earliest co-extruded polyamide (PA)-based backsheet to reach the market, “AAA.” New PV reliability testing protocols have been recently developed and applied to backsheets to reproduce failures observed in the field and evaluate the durability of novel backsheet materials and designs prior to commercialization. A new co-extruded PA-based backsheet was tested using combined-accelerated stress testing (C-AST) and demonstrated a greater lifetime than AAA, and some other fluoropolymer-based backsheets such as polyvinylidene fluoride. The improved PA-based backsheet also eventually failed by through-thickness cracking. Using surface and bulk material characterization techniques, we performed a comprehensive study of material properties before and after the stress testing. Aging of the backsheet resulted in an increase of surface roughness by erosion of the outer PA layer. However the failure is more likely related to an increase in crystallinity of the polyolefin core layer reducing the backsheet tearing energy. The analysis can ultimately inform on the specific weaknesses of the materials so that the manufacturer can improve the backsheet design to extend its lifetime.","IEEE","","National Renewable Energy Lab.

Many reliability problems originate from module attributes, such as metal interconnections to cells, junction boxes. However, significant work in reliability can also be done prior to module design. Testing for reliability earlier in the research cycle increases the probability of avoiding common module reliability problems before cell changes are implemented on a large scale. Cell-level reliability studies can thus lower the rates of module failures in the field and provide confidence to investors that new technologies will perform as advertised. This report summarizes how we investigated three reliability concerns in Cu(In,Ga)Se<sub>2</sub> (CIGS) photovoltaics at the cell level: metastability, shading-induced damage, and potential-induced degradation (PID). We find that examining these concerns required developing robust measurement protocols including the fabrication of novel testing structures. This information will allow readers to incorporate sound metrics for investigating reliability phenomena and aid their studies of cell and module reliability improvements.","Materials Research Society (MRS)","","National Renewable Energy Lab.

Here, we present methodical studies toward understanding the surface states in perovskite thin films utilizing a molecular “positively charged defect indicator” strategy. In formamidinium (FA)-methylammonium (MA) mixed-cation perovskite thin films, a nonuniform distribution of cations is uncovered with FA cations being close to the top and MA close to the bottom of the film, which leads to unique surface defect energetics. Antisite FAI was found to become a dominant deep trap on the surface of this system. As a result, a surface recombination velocity as low as 20 cm/s was achieved in such FA-based perovskite photovoltaic devices.","Elsevier","","National Renewable Energy Lab.

The development of high-performance solar cells offers a promising pathway toward achieving high power per unit cost for many applications. As state-of-the-art of single-junction solar cells are approaching the Shockley–Queisser limit of 32%–33%, an important strategy to raise the efficiency of solar cells further is stacking solar cell materials with different bandgaps to absorb different colors of the solar spectrum. The III–V semiconductor materials provide a relatively convenient system for fabricating multi-junction solar cells providing semiconductor materials that effectively span the solar spectrum as demonstrated by world record efficiencies (39.2% under one-sun and 47.1% under concentration) for six-junction solar cells. This success has inspired attempts to achieve the same with other materials like perovskites for which lower manufacturing costs may be achieved. Recently, Si multi-junction solar cells such as III–V/Si, II–VI/Si, chalcopyrite/Si, and perovskite/Si have become popular and are getting closer to economic competitiveness. Here, we discuss the perspectives of multi-junction solar cells from the viewpoint of efficiency and low-cost potential based on scientific and technological arguments and possible market applications. In addition, this article provides a brief overview of recent developments with respect to III–V multi-junction solar cells, III–V/Si, II–VI/Si, perovskite/Si tandem solar cells, and some new ideas including so-called 3rd generation concepts.","American Institute of Physics (AIP)","","National Renewable Energy Lab.

Azimuth prediction results for 669 individual solar installations associated with 387 sites located across the United States are provided. A mean average error and median average error of 21.65 degrees and 1.0 degrees were obtained, respectively, when predicting the azimuth of the solar fleet data set, with about 80% of the results within an error of zero degrees of the ground truth azimuth value and about 85% within an error of 25 degrees. The predicted azimuth was then used to estimate the energy conversion of the solar arrays. Results show a 90.9 and 90.6 R-squared value for estimating alternating current (AC) and direct current (DC) energy, respectively, and a mean absolute percentage error (MAPE) of 1.70% in estimating the alternating current (AC) energy using the fully automated algorithm.","Elsevier","","National Renewable Energy Lab.

"Efficient prediction of concentrating solar power plant productivity using data clustering","Martinek, Janna; Wagner, Michael J.","14 SOLAR ENERGY; concentrating solar power; CSP; data clustering; dispatch optimization; thermal energy storage","Concentrating solar power (CSP) plants convert solar energy to electricity and can be deployed with a thermal storage capability to shift electricity generation from time periods with available solar resource to those with high electricity demand or electricity price. Rigorous optimization of plant design and operational strategies can improve the market-competitiveness and commercial viability; however, such optimization may require hundreds of annual performance simulations, each of which can be computationally expensive when including considerations such as optimization of dispatch scheduling, sub-hourly time resolution, and stochastic effects due to uncertain weather or electricity price forecasts. This paper proposes a methodology to reduce the computational burden associated with simulation of electricity yield and revenue for CSP plants over a single- or multi-year period. Data-clustering techniques are employed to select a small number of limited-duration time blocks for simulation that, when appropriately weighted, can reproduce generation and revenue over a single year or within each year of a multi-year period. After selection of appropriate data features and weighting factors defining similarity between time-series profiles, the methodology captured annual revenue within 2.3%, 1.7%, or 1.2% using simulation of 10, 30, or 50 three-day exemplar time blocks, respectively, for each of three single-year location/weather/market scenarios and five plant configurations ranging from low to high solar multiple and storage capacity. When applied to multi-year datasets, the proposed methodology can capture inter-year variability that is unavailable from typical meteorological year (TMY) datasets while simultaneously requiring simulation of less than a single year of data.","Elsevier","","National Renewable Energy Lab.

"Cohesive and adhesive degradation in PET-based photovoltaic backsheets subjected to ultraviolet accelerated weathering","Julien, Scott E.; Kim, Jae Hyun; Lyu, Yadong; Miller, David C.; Gu, Xiaohong; Wan, Kai-tak","14 SOLAR ENERGY; accelerated weathering; adhesion; backsheet; delamination; photovoltaic","Delamination between layers in photovoltaic (PV) backsheets is often reported in the literature, causing voids that can collect moisture, diminish module backside heat dissipation, and reduce the backsheet’s effectiveness as a physical barrier. While backsheets with weathering-resistant fluoropolymer outer layers have traditionally been used in modules, more recent backsheets using non-fluoropolymer outer layers, such as polyethylene terephthalate (PET), have been developed. These backsheets have shown signs of premature degradation, and their adhesion degradation, in particular, has not been widely studied. In the present work, the single cantilever beam (SCB) adhesion test was used to quantify the adhesion energy in two commercially available PET-based backsheets. To study the effect of minor changes in formulation, the backsheets were obtained from same manufacturer and product line but during different years. To study the effect of environmental variables on adhesion degradation, the backsheets were subjected to artificial weathering at controlled temperature, humidity, and ultraviolet (UV) radiation in an indoor weathering chamber, and the adhesion energy was quantified at several intervals of exposure time. Layering structure, composition, and adhesion failure mode were compared between the backsheets, using Raman and infrared spectroscopy and thermogravimetric analysis. The results show a large difference in initial (unexposed) adhesion energy between the backsheets, despite very similar structures and compositions. Following exposure, adhesion energy dropped significantly, primarily due to thermo-hydrolytic degradation of the polyurethane (PU)-based adhesive layers.

"Reducing Surface Recombination Velocity of Methylammonium-Free Mixed-Cation Mixed-Halide Perovskites via Surface Passivation","Jariwala, Sarthak; Burke, Sven; Dunfield, Sean; Shallcross, R.

We demonstrate average minority carrier lifetimes >4 µs, nearly single exponential monomolecular photoluminescence decays, and high external photoluminescence quantum efficiencies (>20%, corresponding to ~97% of the maximum theoretical quasi-Fermi-level splitting) at low excitation fluence. We confirm both the composition and valence band edge position of the FA0.83Cs0.17Pb(I0.85Br0.15)3 perovskite using multi-institutional, cross-validated, X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy and UV photoelectron spectroscopy measurements. We extend the APTMS surface passivation to higher bandgap double-cation (FA and Cs) compositions (1.7, 1.75, and 1.8 eV) as well as the widely used triple-cation (FA, MA, and Cs) composition. Finally, we demonstrate that the average surface recombination velocity decreases from ~1000 to ~10 cm/s post APTMS passivation for FA0.83Cs0.17Pb(I0.85Br0.15)3. Our results demonstrate that surface-mediated recombination is the primary nonradiative loss pathway in many methylammonium (MA)-free mixed-cation mixed-halide films with a range of different bandgaps, which is a problem observed for a wide range of perovskite active layers and reactive electrical contacts. Our study also provides insights to develop passivating molecules that help reduce surface recombination in MA-free mixed-cation mixed-halide films and indicates that surface passivation and contact engineering will enable near-theoretical device efficiencies with these materials.","","","National Renewable Energy Lab.

"Resampling and data augmentation for short-term PV output prediction based on an imbalanced sky images dataset using convolutional neural networks","Nie, Yuhao; Zamzam, Ahmed S.; Brandt, Adam","14 SOLAR ENERGY; 97 MATHEMATICS AND COMPUTING; convolutional neural networks; imbalanced datasets; resampling; sky images; solar forecasting","Integrating photovoltaics (PV) into electricity grids is challenged by potentially large fluctuations in power generation. In recent years, sky image-based PV output prediction using convolutional neural networks (CNNs) has emerged as a promising approach to forecasting fluctuations. A key challenge is imbalanced sky image datasets: because of the geography of solar PV system installations, sky image datasets are often rich in sunny condition data but deficient in cloudy condition data. This imbalance contrasts with the fact that model errors are dominated by cloudy condition performance. In this study, we attempt to remedy this by exploring the enrichment and augmentation of an imbalanced sky images dataset for two PV output prediction tasks: nowcasting (predicting concurrent PV output) and forecasting (predicting 15-minute-ahead future PV output). We empirically examine the efficacy of using different resampling and data augmentation approaches to create a rebalanced dataset for model development. A three-stage greedy search is used to determine the optimal resampling approach, data augmentation techniques and over-sampling rate. The results show that for the nowcast problem, resampling and data augmentation can effectively enhance the model performance, reducing overall root mean squared error (RMSE) by an average of 4%, or a 15 std. (standard deviation) of improvement compared to the variability of the baseline model. In contrast, the treatment RMSE for the forecast problem nearly always overlaps the baseline performance at the ± 2 std. level. The optimal resampling approach expands on the original dataset by over-sampling the minority cloudy data, with the best results from large over-sampling rate (e.g., 4 ~ 6 times over-sampling of cloudy images).","Elsevier","","National Renewable Energy Lab.

State-of-the-art CdTe solar cells use CdCl<sub>2</sub> annealing treatments whose effects are still being discovered at a fundamental level. Here, a series of CdTe samples with different annealing temperatures is investigated with high-resolution hyperspectral cathodoluminescence mapping measured at both room temperature and low temperature on the same microscopic areas. A statistical analysis over a large number of grains is combined with a local analysis at grain boundaries. The results elucidate the dynamic interplay between grain boundary and intragrain defect passivation and formation, in the midst of grain growth. The CdCl<sub>2</sub> annealing initially contributes to an increase of the grain size and the passivation of both grain boundaries and grain interiors, increasing the overall luminescence and diffusion length. For higher annealing temperatures, a further increase of grain size is counterbalanced by the rise of bulk defects. The results illustrate the tradeoffs that lead to an optimal annealing temperature, as well as new methods for understanding defect passivation and creation in thin film solar cells.","American Physical Society (APS)","","National Renewable Energy Lab.

Hot carriers are created in semiconductors upon the absorption of photons with energies greater than the bandgap. The excess energy above the bandgap energy is in the form of kinetic energy. The hot carriers can cool to the lattice temperature via electron–phonon scattering and establish separate Boltzmann distributions for electrons and holes at the band edges. Thus, upon cooling, the excess kinetic energy of the hot carriers is transformed into heat and is unavailable to be converted into electrical or chemical free energy in a solar photon-converting cell. This hot-carrier cooling process significantly limits the maximum possible power conversion efficiency (PCE) of the free energy of solar photons into electrical free energy or chemical free energy in chemical bonds of fuels. However, if hot-carrier cooling can be slowed such that the hot carriers can be extracted before cooling to create higher photovoltages, or utilized to create additional electron-hole pairs through carrier multiplication, then beneficial use can be made of the excess energy of hot carriers and the maximum thermodynamic PCE can be dramatically increased. Quantization effects in semiconductor nanostructures, unique properties of some bulk semiconductors, and exciton multiplication in both semiconductors and molecular chromophores that undergo singlet fission have shown a path forward for potential dramatic increases in the PCEs of solar photons into electricity and solar fuels. The status, history, and future promise of the science and technology of these future approaches for different types of photovoltaic cells and cells for solar fuels will be discussed.","American Institute of Physics (AIP)","","National Renewable Energy Lab.

"Evaluation of clear-sky and satellite-derived irradiance data for determining the degradation of photovoltaic system performance","Marion, Bill","14 SOLAR ENERGY; clear-sky; model; photovoltaic; degradation; system; irradiance","Knowing the degradation in performance of a photovoltaic (PV) system over time is important for estimating the lifetime energy produced and the financial return. A key parameter for normalizing performance and determining degradation is the plane-of-array (POA) irradiance. Because accurate long-term POA measurements are not always readily available, three methods of providing irradiance data for determining the degradation rate of PV systems were evaluated—a method using irradiance data modeled with the Ineichen clear-sky model and monthly Linke turbidity coefficients, a method using the supplemental clear-sky irradiance data from the National Solar Radiation Data Base (NSRDB), and a method using the NSRDB solar irradiance data for both cloudy and clear-sky conditions (all-sky). The irradiance data from the three methods were evaluated using measured irradiance data from 1998 through 2018 for the seven-station SURFRAD network and for 3-, 5-, and 10-year periods that might be used for evaluating PV system performance. Only the two clear-sky methods for the 10-year periods had less uncertainty with respect to determining PV system degradation than the expected median degradation rate for PV systems of -0.5%/year to -0.6%/year. Shorter periods and the all-sky method had larger uncertainties, making their use questionable for determining the degradation rates of PV systems.","Elsevier","","National Renewable Energy Lab.

This quality has inhibited common methods to improve solar cell efficiency such as back-surface fields, electron reflectors, or bifacial solar cells. In this work, a significant increase in carrier lifetime to values exceeding 200 ns in fully functional CdTe solar cells is demonstrated. The increased lifetime is achieved by large CdSeTe grains at the absorber/emitter interface, intragrain passivation in the absorber layer, and chemical passivation by forming nanoscale oxidized tellurium species at the transparent conducting oxide interface. The carrier lifetime is correlated to the open-circuit voltage and enables paths for back-surface manipulation and novel cell architectures to further improve CdTe photovoltaic performance.","Wiley","","National Renewable Energy Lab.

C.","54 ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCES; 14 SOLAR ENERGY; climate; PV modules; soiling station; soiling ratio; soiling rate","Soiling, particulate accumulation on photovoltaic (PV) module surfaces, reduces the available solar resource and the resulting generated device power. This case-study summarizes initial results of 5-year research on the contrasting soiling conditions in the tropical, subtropical, and semi-arid climates in Brazil. A major objective is to present a case study of the effects of soiling on PV module performance in different Brazil climate zones that represent the primary areas for the current and expanding Brazil solar installations. For this, the paper presents methodologies to quantify the soiling ratio (SRatio) and soiling rate (SRate) for two representative commercial technologies, polycrystalline or multicrystalline silicon (mc-Si) and thin-film cadmium telluride (CdTe) modules, through soiling monitoring stations deployed in the selected climate regions. An aim is to add to the growing soiling-research knowledge base through addressing these key factors and their relationships to critical electrical, solar resource, thermal, and local meteorological and environmental parameters. This paper presents, evaluates, and compares soiling rates and losses in Belo Horizonte, Minas Gerais (Equatorial Tropical: 19.92° S, 43.99° W), Porto Alegre, Rio Grande do Sul (Humid-Subtropical: 30.05° S, 51.17° W), and Brotas de Macaúbas, Bahia (Semi-Arid: 12.00° S, 42.63° W). The results show that soiling is moderate in all 3-regions, for example with 0.1%/day < SRate < 0.2%/day for Belo Horizonte. Precipitation dominates the cleaning of the modules in the summertime in this climate zone, while it is the major factor year-round in Rio Grande do Sul. Wind is the major issue mitigating the soiling accumulation for the Bahia installation. The methodology incorporates several key refinements, including the normalization and adjustment for the meteorological parameters (temperature, irradiance, wind, precipitation). The evaluations include the region-specific differing effects of non-uniform soiling, natural cleaning, and ambient temperatures.","Elsevier","","National Renewable Energy Lab.

"Evaluation of external tubular configurations for a high-temperature chloride molten salt solar receiver operating above 700°C","Martinek, Janna; Jape, Sameer; Turchi, Craig S.","14 SOLAR ENERGY; concentrating solar power; solar receiver; heat transfer; molten salt","Next-generation concentrating solar power (CSP) tower technologies target operating temperatures exceeding 700°C to increase the thermal-to-electric conversion efficiency. Molten chloride salts are one possible alternative to current commercial molten nitrate salts to enable the higher operating temperature. This paper analyzes the predicted optical, thermal-fluids, and structural performance of traditional external tubular solar receiver configurations applied with a chloride salt heat transfer fluid (HTF) and inlet/outlet temperatures of 500°C/735°C, and considers sensitivity analysis and optimization relative to receiver sizing, tube sizing, number of panels, flow circuit configurations, and solar flux concentration under constraints on internal velocity, pressure drop, wall thickness, and required creep-fatigue lifetime. The high temperature conditions increase the significance of inelastic deformation mechanisms such as creep relative to that expected in commercial 565°C nitrate salt designs. High-temperature creep and creep-fatigue damage in the metal alloy tubes are the key factors that limit allowable solar flux concentration and achievable receiver thermal efficiency at the near-800°C wall temperature conditions. For a traditional external cylindrical receiver configuration, the design parameters and conditions capable of satisfying all constraints produced, at best, a design point receiver efficiency of 78.2%, or 80.5% when excluding receiver intercept efficiency. Variation in the optimal receiver performance relative to uncertainty in the binding maximum velocity, minimum wall thickness, and minimum lifetime constraints is presented.","Elsevier","","National Renewable Energy Lab.

Accurate and reliable efficiency measurements of these PV technologies are crucial, yet much more complicated than for conventional PV technologies due to the former's pronounced dynamic responses to changes in measurement conditions (e.g., current–voltage (I–V) scan rate and preconditioning) and their susceptibility to degradation. Adjustments to the measurement procedures are therefore necessary so that a reproducible “steady state” is reached during measurement. Furthermore, given the small size of many emerging cells, inappropriate device area definition and solar simulator setup can lead to measurement errors. Here, comprehensive efficiency calibration guidance is offered for emerging solar cells, including area measurement; spectral irradiance translation to standard test conditions; and steady-state electrical performance. The necessity of reporting steady-state efficiency is justified with a statistical performance comparison between conventional and steady-state I–V scans over hundreds of cells the group has received globally for efficiency certifications. The procedures described here do not require specialized measurement instrumentation; what matters most are changes to the measurement protocols. These described changes aim to enable better comparisons between reported efficiencies.","Wiley","","National Renewable Energy Lab.

To date, there has been little work on determining the TPCE for perovskite photovoltaics (PV). We fabricate perovskite solar cells with a TPCE of -0.08 rel %/°C and then disentangle the temperature-dependent effects of the perovskite absorber, contact layers, and interfaces by comparing different device architectures and using drift-diffusion modeling. A main factor contributing to the small TPCE of perovskites is their low intrinsic carrier concentrations with respect to Si and GaAs, which can be explained by its wider band gap. In this work, we demonstrate that the unique increase in Eg with increasing temperatures seen for perovskites results in a reduction in JSC but positively influences VOC. The current limiting factors for the TPCE in perovskite PV are identified to originate from interfacial effects.","American Chemical Society (ACS)","","National Renewable Energy Lab.

"3D/2D passivation as a secret to success for polycrystalline thin-film solar cells","McGott, Deborah L.; Muzzillo, Christopher P.; Perkins, Craig L.; Berry, Joseph J.; Zhu, Kai; Duenow, Joel N.; Colegrove, Eric; Wolden, Colin A.; Reese, Matthew O.","14 SOLAR ENERGY; passivation; 2D; two dimensional; 3D/2D; thin films; CdTe; CIGS; perovskites; PSCs; van der Waals; surface","Polycrystalline photovoltaic materials offer low costs and good scalability; however, grain boundaries in these materials are extended defects, which can drastically increase carrier recombination. Interestingly, three leading polycrystalline thin-film technologies—cadmium telluride (CdTe), CuIn<sub>1-x</sub>Ga<sub>x</sub>Se<sub>2</sub> (CIGS), and perovskite solar cells (PSCs)—passivate absorber surfaces in the same way: via formation of low-dimensional, typically two-dimensional (2D), van der Waals materials. This has primarily occurred serendipitously through process optimization, but in some cases, 2D capping layers are intentionally incorporated to improve device performance. Here, evidence compiled from the literature, supplemented with new data where necessary, is presented to illustrate the existence of 3D/2D interfaces in CdTe, CIGS, and PSCs, and their correlation with improved passivation and device performance. This suggests that 3D/2D passivation might be a heretofore unappreciated key to successful polycrystalline thin-film photovoltaics. Finally, the desired attributes of successful low-dimensional layers are presented with rational design strategies for next-generation polycrystalline solar cells.","Elsevier","","National Renewable Energy Lab.

"An efficient method to identify uncertainties of WRF-Solar variables in forecasting solar irradiance using a tangent linear sensitivity analysis","Yang, Jaemo; Kim, Ju-Hye; Jimenez, Pedro A.; Sengupta, Manajit; Dudhia, Jimy; Xie, Yu; Golnas, Anastasios; Giering, Ralf","14 SOLAR ENERGY; WRF-Solar; tangent linear; sensitivity analysis; ensemble prediction","Uncertainty in predicting solar energy resources introduces major challenges in power system management and necessitates the development of reliable probabilistic solar forecasts. As the first part of the development of probabilistic forecasts based on the Weather Research and Forecasting model with solar extensions (WRF-Solar), this study presents a tangent linear approach to identify input variables responsible for the largest uncertainties in predicting surface solar irradiance and clouds. A tangent linear analysis is capable of efficiently investigating sensitivities of output variables with respect to various input variables of WRF-Solar because this approach avoids the computational burden of perturbing the initial conditions of individual input variables. We develop tangent linear models (TLMs) for six WRF-Solar physics packages that control the formation and dissipation of clouds and solar radiation, and we evaluate the validity of TLMs using a linearity test. The tangent linear sensitivity analysis is conducted under various scenarios based on satellite observations and model simulations to consider realistic input conditions. A simple method is used to quantify the impact of the uncertainty of input variables on the output variables from the TLMs. The results demonstrate that uncertainties in the output variables that are the focus of this study—including global horizontal irradiance, direct normal irradiance, cloud mixing ratio, cloud tendency, cloud fraction, and sensible and latent heat fluxes—are highly sensitive to uncertainties in 14 input variables. This study indicates that the tangent linear method can identify key variables of physics modules in WRF-Solar that can be stochastically perturbed to generate ensemble-based probabilistic forecasts.","Elsevier","","National Renewable Energy Lab.

We find that the annual power-weighted average operating temperature is most readily reduced via sub-band-gap reflection from the module glass, by 3.3 K for Al-BSF modules and 2.9 K for PERC modules with 100% sub-band-gap reflection. Sub-band-gap reflection at the cell interface offers up to 2.2 K (1.8 K) temperature reduction for Al-BSF (PERC) modules, increased cell rear reflection offers up to 1.2 K temperature reduction, and directional scattering offers up to 1.5 K reduction.","Elsevier","","Univ. of Minnesota, Minneapolis, MN (United States); National Renewable Energy Lab.

Using a price-taker model with hourly energy and capacity prices projected to 2050, we simulated the revenue-maximizing dispatch of three PV-plus-battery architectures, with fixed component sizing, in three locations. The architectures reflect different coupling types, which vary in terms of whether the PV and battery systems have separate inverters or a shared inverter and whether the battery can charge from the grid. We found that the highest-value architecture today varies largely based on PV penetration and the magnitude and timing of peak-price periods. As PV penetration increases over time—based on the evolution of the bulk power system—two trends emerge that indicate a convergence of the values of the systems studied. First, the energy values of the three architectures converge as an increasing fraction of energy from the coupled PV is used to charge the battery. Second, their capacity values converge to that of the battery as the capacity credit of stand-alone PV approaches zero. Of the systems studied, no single architecture has the highest year-one benefit-cost ratio in every region and year, and benefit-cost ratios of PV-plus-battery systems range from a 15% reduction to a 25% increase compared to separate PV and battery systems. Understanding the factors that influence the performance and economics of PV-plus-battery systems will help system planners and researchers evaluate the potential benefits of these hybrid resources to future power systems.","Elsevier","","National Renewable Energy Lab.

"Optimizing Vehicle Fleet and Assignment for Concentrating Solar Power Plant Heliostat Washing","Wales, Jesse G.; Zolan, Alexander J.; Newmans, Alexandra M.; Wagner, Michael J.","14 SOLAR ENERGY; concentrating solar power; decomposition; fleet sizing; mixed-integer nonlinear programming; operations and maintenance optimization; vehicle assignment","Concentrating solar power central-receiver plants use thousands of sun-tracking mirrors, i.e., heliostats, to reflect sunlight to a central receiver, which collects and uses the heat to generate electricity. Over time, soiling reduces the reflectivity of the heliostats and, therefore, the efficiency of the system. Current industry practice sends vehicles to wash heliostats in an ad hoc fashion. We present a mixed-integer nonlinear program that determines wash vehicle fleet size, mix, and assignment of wash crews to heliostats to minimize the sum of (i) the revenues lost due to heliostat soiling, (ii) the costs of hiring wash crews and operating the vehicles, and (iii) the costs of purchasing wash vehicles. We establish conditions for convexity of the objective function, and then propose a decomposition method that enables near-optimal solutions to the wash vehicle fleet sizing and assignment problem on the order of a couple of minutes. Furthermore, these solutions yield hundreds of thousands of dollars in savings per year over current industry practices.","Taylor & Francis","","National Renewable Energy Lab.

This range allows a variation in the conduction band offset from -0.1 eV (cliff like) to +0.32 eV (spike like). A maximum efficiency of 18.5% for cells with the bilayer CdSeTe/CdTe absorber occurs at x=0.15, which corresponds to a spike-like band offset near 0.2 eV, as confirmed by X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy. In addition, good cell performance is seen over a fairly broad range of x extending from 0.1 to 0.25. Here, the MZO optical bandgap increases with the Mg fraction, consistent with an increasing conduction band offset. Temperature-dependent current-voltage measurements and time-resolved photoluminescence show improvement in the emitter/absorber interface with the incorporation of Mg. Capacitance-voltage measurements show that the depletion region extends further into the absorber with more Mg, and X-ray diffraction confirms a change from a hexagonal-dominant crystal structure toward zinc blende at x=0.35.","Wiley","","National Renewable Energy Lab.

Despite the increasing interest in FPV systems, a robust validation of their suggested co-benefits and impacts on the nexus of energy, water, and food (EWF) systems is lacking. This information gap makes it challenging for decision makers to justify its adoption—potentially suppressing FPV deployment. To address this gap and to help de-risk this PV deployment opportunity, we (1) review the suggested co-benefits of FPV systems with a focus on the impacts that could alleviate pressures on EWF systems and (2) identify areas where further research is needed to reduce uncertainty around FPV system performance. Our review reveals that EWF nexus-relevant co-benefits, such as improved panel efficiency and reduced land usage, are corroborated in the literature, whereas others, such as water quality impacts, lack empirical evidence. Our findings indicate that further research is needed to quantify the water-related and broader economic, environmental, social, sustainability, justice, and resilience co-benefits and impacts of FPV systems.","MDPI","","National Renewable Energy Lab.

The commercial scale tank liner is an anchored brick and mortar design with expansion joints to accommodate thermal expansion. Furthermore, finite element analysis is performed to optimize the thermal and mechanical profile of the tank. Equalizing the shell temperature between the water-cooled foundation and the shell wall is necessary to minimize differential thermomechanical stress and lower overall stress values below industrial allowable limits. The cost of the TES system is estimated to be $60/kWhth, which is four times greater than Department of Energy targets.

Maximizing the reflection of light that is unusable for energy conversion is one of the most promising ways to reduce the operating temperature of fielded modules. We derive a model based on a steady-state energy balance to quantify the temperature benefit of cell or module optical modifications aimed at improving reflection of light with photon energies below the photovoltaic cell bandgap energy. This more detailed model is then simplified so that, from outdoor measured data, temperature differences arising from reflectance can be isolated from those arising from irradiance, wind speed, and module standard-test-condition efficiency.","Elsevier","","National Renewable Energy Lab.

Indoor testing covers irradiance calibration and temperature dependencies, which are necessary to achieve high accuracy, low uncertainty field measurements. Field testing includes an array of different environments including Saudi Arabia, California, Utah, and Colorado. DUSST versions include a configuration with a 530-nm light emitting diode (LED) (discussed in previous work) and a unit with seven white LEDs and a polycarbonate collimating optic. The new design increases light intensity fivefold and demonstrates a single linear calibration coefficient is effective to measure soiling losses as high as 75%. Field data from Utah and California demonstrate that daily soiling loss measurements and soiling rate calculations closely match both reference cell and full-size module measurements of soiling losses and soiling rates. Corrective methods employed on the Utah DUSST sensor suggest that it is possible to achieve measurement errors as low as ±0.1% at two standard deviations. Field data from both Colorado and Saudi Arabia demonstrate that LED lens soiling can occur and that further design optimizations are needed.

The general steps to calculate the performance loss rate are (i) input data cleaning and grading; (ii) data filtering; (iii) performance metric selection, corrections, and aggregation; and finally, (iv) application of a statistical modeling method to determine the performance loss rate value. In this study, several high-quality power and irradiance datasets have been shared, and the participants of the study were asked to calculate the performance loss rate of each individual system using their preferred methodologies.

The combination of data filtering, metrics (performance ratio or power based), and statistical modeling methods are benchmarked in terms of (i) their deviation from the average value and (ii) their uncertainty, standard error, and confidence intervals.

For most applications, backsheets consist of opaque, but highly reflective, films that protect inner layers from degradation from ultraviolet (UV) light. Backsheets can fail if they delaminate or form cracks under strain. In a PV module, the maximum strains that can be applied are only on the order of a few percent. The greatest strains are likely to be highly localized around topographical features. Therefore, to assess the likelihood of a crack being initiated in a backsheet, we apply small amplitude strains to backsheet films under microscopic examination using a laser scanning confocal microscope. Furthermore, this allows us to monitor both the depth and density of cracks as well as the onset strain. Here we perform these measurements after exposure to UV light.","Elsevier","","National Renewable Energy Lab.

"Thermomechanical fatigue resistance of low temperature solder for multiwire interconnects in photovoltaic modules","Spinella, Laura; Bosco, Nick","36 MATERIALS SCIENCE; 14 SOLAR ENERGY; fatigue; accelerated testing; multiwire; durability; indium; bismuth; low temperature solder","Novel interconnect technologies leveraging low melting temperature solders, such as multiwire interconnects, are being deployed in photovoltaic (PV) modules for improved reliability through interconnect redundancy and lower thermal loads during interconnection and lamination. However, the equivalency of standardized accelerated testing to field conditions has not yet been established for these emerging technologies. In this study, the thermomechanical fatigue resistance of low temperature solder alloys is investigated and compared to that of conventional SnPb to assess the acceleration behavior of these alloys. While InSn is shown to have sufficient thermomechanical fatigue resistance on the order of that of SnPb, these results indicate Sn–Bi alloys may have poor thermomechanical fatigue resistance at field conditions. The results also show that Sn–Bi alloys have thermal cycling acceleration factors of less than one. This indicates that the standardized accelerated thermal cycling test, such as that in IEC 61215, will produce misleading results for Sn–Bi alloys and that unique testing is required for this PV module architecture. Though accelerated thermal cycling may be a meaningful qualification test for SnPb solder joints, these results suggest that mechanical loading may be a more appropriate test for Sn–Bi multiwire interconnects. This is due to the distinct processing and geometry of multiwire interconnects which may allow for mechanical, rather than strictly metallurgical interconnections.","Elsevier","","National Renewable Energy Lab.

Across all these deposition technologies, we noted the same trend: higher diffusion temperatures yield films that are more crystalline but that have rougher surface morphologies due to bigger surface crystal grains. Also, the recrystallization process of the as-deposited Si films starts from the SiO<sub>x</sub> interface, rather than from the film surface and bulk. However, there are some distinct differences among these technologies. First, the LPCVD method yields the lowest deposition rate, roughest surfaces, and smallest degree of crystallinity on finished poly-Si films. In contrast, the PECVD method has the highest deposition rate and smoothest surfaces for both as-deposited Si and annealed poly-Si films. Second, as-deposited sputtered and PECVD Si films contain only an amorphous phase, whereas as-deposited LPCVD films already has some crystalline phase. Third, the LPCVD phosphorus in-diffusion into the substrate depends strongly on the initial film thickness, whereas for the other two methods, it is weakly dependent on thickness. Finally, the passivation quality of every poly-Si film type has different responses to the film thickness and diffusion temperature, suggesting that the ex situ doping optimization should be performed independently.","Wiley","","National Renewable Energy Lab.

An alternative to extensive and capital-intensive upgrades is to offer non-firm interconnection opportunities to distributed generators, via a coordinated operation of utility scale resources. This paper introduces a novel flexible interconnection option based on the last-in, first-out principles of access aimed at minimizing the unnecessary non-firm generation energy curtailment by balancing access rights and contribution to thermal overloads. Although we focus on solar photovoltaic (PV) plants in this work, the introduced flexible interconnection option applies to any distributed generation technology. The curtailment risk of individual non-firm PV units is evaluated across a range of PV penetration levels in a yearlong quasi-static time-series simulation on a real-world feeder. The results show the importance of the size of the curtailment zone in the curtailment risk distribution among flexible generation units as well as that of the “access right” defined by the order in which PV units connect to the grid. Case study results reveal that, with a proper selection of curtailment radius, utilities can reduce the total curtailment of flexible PV resources by up to more than 45%. Findings show that non-firm PV generators can effectively avoid all thermal limit-related upgrade costs.</p>","MDPI AG","","National Renewable Energy Lab.

The p-type thin films consist of columnar grains that grow along the <100> direction, which is the same orientation as the n-type single crystal. In addition, the interface of the pn homojunctions is void-free and compositionally sharp. The SnS homojunction solar cell achieves an open-circuit voltage (VOC) of 360 mV, which is as large as the highest VOC of previously reported SnS-based heterojunction solar cells.

For the accelerated weathering tests, two different EVA formulations in the glass/EVA/glass-laminated coupons were exposed to ultraviolet (UV) light for 180 days at three different temperatures (40, 60, and 80 °C) and UV intensities (0.4, 2.2, and 2.9 W/m2/nm at 340 nm). The fluorescence spectra and moduli were uniform through the cross section of both EVA formulations at the lowest temperature and UV intensity; however, under the highest temperature and UV intensity, the UV irradiated sides showed lower moduli and higher fluorescence compared to the opposite sides. For EVA obtained from PV modules deployed 27 years in Sacramento, CA, USA, changes in fluorescence intensity across the thickness were relatively greater than changes in modulus. On the other hand, for EVA obtained from the same type of module stored in the shed for 27 years, no fluorescence was observed, and a uniform modulus was seen through the EVA layer, but with substantially higher values than those obtained from the field-deployed modules. The different extent of changes between laboratory and field exposures suggests the importance of considering effects of temperature and UV intensity for designing a reliable accelerated testing.

"Identification of Recombination Losses in CdSe/CdTe Solar Cells from Spectroscopic and Microscopic Time-Resolved Photoluminescence","Kuciauskas, Darius; Moseley, John; Lee, Chungho","14 SOLAR ENERGY; CdTe; spectroscopy; solar cells","Due to the lowest-cost and best reliability, CdTe solar cells are the leading thin-film photovoltaic technology. Increasing open-circuit voltage by reducing recombination represents the most promising path toward further improvements. Analysis is needed to identify limitations that cause efficiency losses. To achieve this goal for Cu-doped CdSe/CdTe solar cells, time-resolved spectroscopy and microscopy are developed and applied. Recombination lifetimes and radiative efficiency identify that defect-mediated recombination is the dominant voltage loss mechanism. When carrier lifetimes are averaged over many crystalline grains, they increase from 180 to 430 ns when Al2O3 is applied to the back contact. The quasi-Fermi-level splitting correspondingly increases from 880–905 to 906–931 mV, indicating a pathway to overcome the long-standing 900 mV voltage limitation. However, the dominant recombination losses are attributed to the absorber bulk. From microscopic carrier lifetime measurements, it is identified that space charge fields due to charged grain boundaries (GBs) lead to recombination in the CdTe absorber bulk. At high injection, GB space charge fields are screened, but that occurs above 1 Sun excitation conditions. Alloying with selenium in the near-interface CdSeTe absorber region reduces GB losses and is identified as one of the factors leading to high radiative and power conversion efficiency.","Wiley","","National Renewable Energy Lab.

This experimental observation was shown consistent with a weakest link theory prediction that the strength limiting flaws reside on the surface of the cell’s edge. The analysis is ultimately extended to present the equivalent loading of four-cell modules by uniformpressure and 4PF and a uniformly loaded full-sized module and demonstrates that smaller, representative, modules must be loaded to a much higher level than their parent full-sized modules to achieve an equivalent probability for cell fracture.","IEEE","","National Renewable Energy Lab.

The fabrication of TCA sheets from an ethyl-vinyl acetate (EVA) matrix and silver coated compliant conductive microspheres, similar to industry-standard EVA encapsulant sheets, compatible with a standard lamination process was developed. Blade coating TCA sheets using 3D printed blades and testing of vertical conduction through the interlayer with a TCA conductivity jig allowed for reproducible measurements and low-cost fabrication. The supplemental information provides design files to enable other researchers to produce their own blades and testing jigs. We identified 0.5 mm as an optimal blade height for producing lab-scale TCA sheets and 120 °C at 3 psi for 10 min as the optimal vacuum lamination process to minimize resistance and possible damage to samples. For TCA sheets with coverages between 0.75% and 9%, the series resistance was approximately 0.2 O cm2 which should result in minimal losses for one-sun photovoltaic applications.","IOP Publishing","","National Renewable Energy Lab.

An event-driven predictive approach for real-time volt/volt-ampere reactive (VAR) optimization, along with local two-level adaptive volt/VAR droop-based control algorithm for advanced distribution management systems, is introduced. The methodology covers aggregated and autonomous controls under different timescale operations, including the impact and effect of unpredicted events such as cloud transients on PV power production. In addition, the control schemes include the uncertainties in PV power generation and load power demand. The proposed methodology is validated in a real-time framework using the real-time digital simulator platform through co-simulation with models based on Python and OpenDSS (Open Distribution System Simulator). The developed methodology is tested on the modified IEEE 123-feeder test system.

We compile localized regulatory information and use high-resolution data to present multiple siting regimes covering relatively constrained to unconstrained potentials. Our efforts reveal high sensitivity to these variables and sizable uncertainty in the overall wind energy resource potential. Specifically, we find that siting constraints may shift the total capacity available to commercial wind energy by 2.3–15.1 TW. Furthermore, our results illustrate that technology advancement could require larger setbacks from buildings and infrastructure, reducing the total available capacity potential by 20% relative to estimates using current technology, but that this reduction is largely offset by increased generation such that the net effect on generation is 1%. The observed sensitivity to and uncertainty resulting from the variables we analyze suggest there is value in continued study and development of increasingly sophisticated approaches to characterizing wind resource potential.","Elsevier","","National Renewable Energy Lab.

"Standards development for modules in high temperature micro-environments","Kempe, Michael D.; Holsapple, Derek; Whitfield, Kent; Shiradkar, Narendra","14 SOLAR ENERGY; photovoltaic; standards; high temperature; micro-environment; durability; reliability; safety","Photovoltaic (PV) module qualification standards, IEC 61215 and IEC 61730, were designed to apply to “general open-air climates” and IEC 61730 specifically indicated applicability of ambient air temperature of 40°C. Additionally, these standards provided allowances for so-called “open rack mounted PV modules” without a clear definition of “open-rack.” These implied restrictions and allowances meant that hotter climates or thermally restrictive installation methods may not be covered by these often customer-mandated certification standards. This is particularly salient for the significant growth regions of the Middle East and India that would be expected to operate at significantly higher temperatures. The applicability of these documents raised issues over the definition of “open rack” and the fact that the geographic location is just as important as the mounting configuration in assessing the impact of the micro-environment of a PV module. This work summarizes the scientific background for IEC Technical Specification 63126:2020 ED1, titled “Guidelines for qualifying PV modules components and materials for operation at high temperatures.” This standard was recently published by the IEC and is the first step in a systematic effort to rework these standards to address the question of temperature more directly. Instead of specifying a mounting condition, we specify different suites of tests suitable for a system (PV module, mounting style, and location) defined by the 98th percentile cell temperature. With a defined temperature regime to work from, this allowed us to use existing literature research combined with additional modeling work to determine, which tests would need to be modified. This resulted in suggested changes to material thermal indices, thermal cycling temperatures, hot spot testing, ultraviolet testing, and bypass diode testing among other tests and characteristics described in this study.","Wiley","","National Renewable Energy Lab.

Here we use experimental parameters from optical spectroscopy measurements to calculate the limiting efficiency of perovskite–silicon and all-perovskite two-terminal tandems, employing currently available bandgap materials, as 42.0% and 40.8%, respectively. We show luminescence coupling between subcells (the optical transfer of photons from the high-bandgap to low-bandgap subcell) relaxes current matching when the high-bandgap subcell is a luminescent perovskite. We calculate that luminescence coupling becomes important at charge trapping rates (=10<sup>6</sup> s<sup>-1</sup>) already being achieved in relevant halide perovskites. Luminescence coupling increases flexibility in subcell thicknesses and tolerance to different spectral conditions. For maximal benefit, the high-bandgap subcell should have the higher short-circuit current under average spectral conditions. This can be achieved by reducing the bandgap of the high-bandgap subcell, allowing wider, unstable bandgap compositions to be avoided. Lastly, we visualize luminescence coupling in an all-perovskite tandem through cross-section luminescence imaging.","American Chemical Society (ACS)","","National Renewable Energy Lab.

Combined-accelerated stress testing (C-AST) is one such method which has demonstrated reliable reproduction of some field-failures which were not reproducible by standard certification tests. To increase confidence and assist in the development of C-AST, and other new testing protocols, it is important to validate that the failure modes observed and mechanisms induced are representative of those observed in the field, and not the product of unrealistic stress conditions. Here we outline a method using appropriate materials characterization and modelling to validate the failure mechanisms induced in C-AST such that we can increase confidence in the test protocol. The method is demonstrated by applying it to a known cracking failure of a specific polyamide (PA)-based backsheet material. We found that the failure of the PA-based backsheet was a result of a combination of stress factors. Photo-oxidation from ultra-violet (UV) radiation exposure caused a reduction in fracture toughness, which ultimately lead to the cracking failure. We show that the chemical and structural changes observed in the backsheet following C-AST aging were also observed in field-aged samples. These results increase confidence that the conditions applied in C-AST are representative of the field and demonstrates our approach to validating the failure mechanisms induced.</jats:p>","Nature Publishing Group","","National Renewable Energy Lab.

"Measured and satellite-derived albedo data for estimating bifacial photovoltaic system performance","Marion, Bill","14 SOLAR ENERGY; bifacial; irradiance; data; network; satellite; albedo","The albedo of the ground surface is an important factor in the cost-effectiveness of a bifacial photovoltaic (PV) system. To improve the availability of reliable albedo data, datasets of ground albedo and associated meteorological data were developed by using existing measurement network data and data measured by the PV industry. The measured datasets include time-series data as well as summary information of tabular monthly and yearly data and plots of monthly and hourly albedo values. Satellite-derived values of albedo are available from the National Solar Radiation Data Base (NSRDB). The NSRDB albedos were compared to the measured albedos for Surface Radiation budget (SURFRAD) network locations for the period 2001–2017, and the mean bias difference results were from -0.044 to +0.056. Overall, these differences are greater than the albedo measurement uncertainty of ±0.02; consequently, the NSRDB albedos should be used with caution for estimating the performance of bifacial PV systems. Differences between SURFRAD and NSRDB albedos are attributed to the NSRDB method for determining albedo and to the ground surfaces within the NSRDB 4 km spatial resolution pixel consisting of a mixture of surface types rather than just the single surface types viewed by the albedometers at the SURFRAD stations.","Elsevier","","National Renewable Energy Lab.

Comparisons are made to a Class-A pyranometer also mounted on the one-axis tracking surface. Systematic biases over the day and year are observed in the ratio of the reference cell’s measurements to reference pyranometer measurements. This systematic bias is associated with the spectral, temperature, and angle-of-incident effects that differ between the reference cell and the reference pyranometer. The comparison is done for selected clear and totally cloudy days to determine the magnitude of the effects and to characterize the influence of these effects on the reference cell measurements. A model to calculate the reference cell output based on spectral irradiance and reference cell temperature is introduced.","Elsevier","","National Renewable Energy Lab.

"Homogenous Voltage-Matched Strings Using Three-Terminal Tandem Solar Cells: Fundamentals and End Losses","McMahon, William E.; Schulte-Huxel, Henning; Buencuerpo, Jeronimo; Geisz, John F.; Young, Michelle S.; Klein, Talysa R.; Tamboli, Adele C.; Warren, Emily L.","14 SOLAR ENERGY; photovoltaic; PV cells; solar cells; solar stringing; tandem cells; three terminal; voltage matched","Strings constructed from three-terminal tandem (3TT) solar cells offer the performance benefits of voltage-matching (which reduces sensitivity to spectral variation), but without the subcell voltage isolation required by four-terminal cells. However, the circuitry for a 3TT string can become complex, making circuit analysis more challenging. Here, we illustrate the essential features of “homogenous” voltage-matched (VM) 3TT strings, for which all 3TT cells in the string are nominally identical (with the same design/doping sequence, such that they can be fabricated on the same manufacturing line). Several representative VM string configurations are explicitly considered, and used to describe the general construction of string I(V) curves. End losses intrinsic to these strings are discussed in detail, along with mitigation strategies to minimize their impact. Our analysis agrees with experimental results for eight-cell strings constructed from GaInP/GaAs 3TT devices.","IEEE","","National Renewable Energy Lab.

However, ARC longevity can vary from less than 1 to over 15 years depending on coating quality and deployment conditions. A technique that can quantify ARC degradation nondestructively on commercial modules would be useful both for in-field diagnostics and accelerated aging tests. In this article, we demonstrate that accurate measurements of ARC spectral reflectance can be performed using a modified commercially available integrating-sphere probe. The measurement is fast, accurate, nondestructive, and can be performed outdoors in full-sun conditions. We develop an interferometric model that estimates coating porosity, thickness, and fractional area coverage from the measured reflectance spectrum for a uniform single-layer coating. We demonstrate the measurement outdoors on an active PV installation, identify the presence of an ARC, and estimate the properties of the coating.","IEEE","","National Renewable Energy Lab.

The recent development in inverter technologies provides the opportunity to develop control systems to realize effective PV governance and thus to improve dynamic PV hosting capacity for distribution grids. In this paper, a novel distributed energy resource management system (DERMS) solution is proposed by adopting the real-time optimal power flow (OPF) approach for coordinated control of the distributed PV inverters. The proposed approach eliminates the dependence on load knowledge via measurement feedback correction, and it can be implemented in real time. One challenge is that the technique is sensitive to the data availability and integrity of voltage measurements. Therefore, a decentralized DERMS approach is developed by leveraging the concepts of state estimation. The framework and the effectiveness of the solution approach are numerically demonstrated on a real distribution feeder in Southern California.","IEEE","","National Renewable Energy Lab.

"Secondary Frequency Regulation from Variable Generation through Uncertainty Decomposition: An Economic and Reliability Perspective","Fang, Xin; Yuan, Haoyu; Tan, Jin","14 SOLAR ENERGY; economic dispatch; frequency regulation; reliability; uncertainty; variable generation","The rapid integration of variable generation (VG), such as photovoltaics (PV), necessitates an increase in the secondary frequency regulation (SFR) to handle the system intra-dispatch interval imbalance because of VG's variation. Although PV has the control capability to provide SFR, the main challenge is in guaranteeing the delivery of PV's energy and SFRs capacities in the automatic generation control (AGC) within each dispatch interval considering its uncertainty. This paper proposes a deliverable VG SFR provision model with endogenous VG's power uncertainty decomposition. First, the uncertainty of VG is decomposed using distributionally robust chance constraints through which the deliverable SFR provision is guaranteed. Next, the intra-interval frequency response of PV's SFR is validated with a user defined AGC model including the PV power plant. Finally, the economic benefits and the reliability improvements such as the frequency deviation reduction with PV providing SFRcan be integrated and evaluated. The proposed model is tested in a modified 18-bus system and in the Western Electricity Coordinating Council test system. Results demonstrate that with the deliverable SFR from PV, the system cost and the frequency reliability can be improved simultaneously. PV's SFR performance can be guaranteed with the proposed model.","IEEE","","National Renewable Energy Lab.

Appreciably reducing industrial CO2 emissions will necessarily involve addressing IPH demand. Solar photovoltaics (PV) have contributed to the changing fuel mix of electricity generation in the United States, but on-site use of solar energy in the manufacturing sector remains insignificant. To understand the economic feasibility of IPH fuel switching, we develop an open-source process parity framework to identify conditions when solar process heat technologies can reach cost parity with an incumbent fossil fuel combustion technology. Building a case study that reflects common IPH demands and applicable solar technologies across several locations in the United States, we generalize the relationship between key parameters of solar resource, investment and fuel prices. We evaluate the use of solar thermal (ST) and PV connected electric boilers to partially substitute natural gas boilers in a brewery. Cost parity is not achieved in any analysis location for current solar system costs and fuel prices. Los Angeles County is most likely to achieve cost parity due to the higher fuel prices compared to other counties.","Elsevier","","National Renewable Energy Lab.

The method is based on in-situ measurement of the module’s dark current-voltage (I-V) characteristic curve during the stress test, as well as initial and final module flash testing on a Sun simulator. The method uses superposition of the dark I-V curve with final flash test module short-circuit current to account for shunt and junction recombination losses, as well as series resistance estimation from the in-situ measured dark I-Vs and final flash test measurements. The method is developed based on mc-Si standard modules undergoing several stages of thermo-mechanical stress testing and degradation, for which we investigate the impact of the degradation on the modules light I-V curve parameters, and equivalent solar cell model parameters. Experimental validation of the method on the modules tested shows good agreement between the in-situ estimated power degradation and the flash test measured power loss of the modules, of up to 4.31 % error (RMSE), as the modules experience primarily junction defect recombination and increased series resistance losses. However, the application of the method will be limited for modules experiencing extensive photo-current degradation or delamination, which are not well reflected in the dark I-V characteristic of the PV module.","MDPI AG","","National Renewable Energy Lab.

How to correctly model the solar generation in the market and solve the uncertainty-based operation problems call for solutions. Unlike other renewable resources, solar power can be more easily applied to the demand side through behind-the-meter installations in a distributed manner with significant future extensibility. The corresponding operational rules in the markets are largely being revised. Over the past two decades, with the development of deregulated power markets, numerous studies related to uncertainty-based market operations tend to transform the market from a deterministic and centralized framework to a stochastic and decentralized one. As the relevant literature is most recent, this paper reviews their contributions to electricity market operations with solar integration and underlines the research directions of this topic and ongoing industry practices. A thorough review of the electricity markets worldwide with solar energy is provided. A variety of proposed mathematical solutions to the problem are also addressed.","Elsevier","","National Renewable Energy Lab.

The optimum bandgap for the terrestrial spectrum lies beyond the absorption range of a traditional dual junction GaInP/GaAs cell, with the bottom GaAs cell having higher bandgap energy than necessary. Lower energy bandgaps can be achieved with multiple quantum wells (QWs), but such a pathway requires advanced management of the epitaxial growth conditions in order to be useful. Strain-balanced GaAsP/GaInAs QWs are incorporated into a single junction GaAs solar cell and a dual junction GaInP/GaAs solar cell, leading to 27.2% efficiency in the single junction device and a one-sun record 32.9% efficiency in the tandem device. Good carrier collection and low non-radiative recombination are observed in the cells with up to 80 QWs. The GaAs cells employ a rear-heterojunction architecture to boost the open-circuit voltage to over 1.04 V in the quantum well device, despite the large number of QWs.","Wiley","","National Renewable Energy Lab.

Industrial entities aim to commercialize perovskite technologies because of high performance but also because this type of semiconductor can be processed from solution, a feature enabling low cost and fast production. In this work, we analyse the health and environmental impacts of eight solvents commonly used in perovskite processing. We consider first- and higher-order ramifications of each solvent on an industrial scale such as solvent production, use/removal, emissions and potential end-of-life treatments. Further, we consider the energy of evaporation for each solvent, air emission, condensation and subsequent incineration, reuse or distillation for solvent recycling, and apply a full end-of-life analysis. For human health impact, we use the ‘USEtox’ method but also consider toxicity data beyond carcinogenic classifications. We find that dimethyl sulfoxide has the lowest total impact, by being the most environmentally friendly and least deleterious to human health of the solvents considered. The analysis of the effects of these solvents on human health and the environment provides guidance for sustainable development of this new technology.","Springer Nature","","National Renewable Energy Lab.

"Data-Driven Multi-agent Deep Reinforcement Learning for Distribution System Decentralized Voltage Control with High Penetration of PVs","Cao, Di; Zhao, Junbo; Hu, Weihao; Ding, Fei; Huang, Qi; Chen, Zhe; Blaabjerg, Frede","14 SOLAR ENERGY; distribution network; Gaussian process regression; multi-agent deep reinforcement learning; network partition; PVs; voltage regulation","This paper proposes a novel model-free/data-driven centralized training and decentralized execution multi-agent deep reinforcement learning (MADRL) framework for distribution system voltage control with high penetration of PVs. The proposed MADRL can coordinate both the real and reactive power control of PVs with existing static var compensators and battery storage systems. Unlike the existing DRL-based voltage control methods, our proposed method does not rely on a system model during both the training and execution stages. This is achieved by developing a new interaction scheme between the surrogate modeling of the original system and the multi-agent soft actor critic (MASAC) MADRL algorithm. In particular, the sparse pseudo-Gaussian process with a few-shots of measurements is utilized to construct the surrogate model of the original environment, i.e., power flow model. This is a data-driven process and no model parameters are needed. Furthermore, the MASAC enabled MADRL allows to achieve better scalability by dividing the original system into different voltage control regions with the aid of real and reactive power sensitivities to voltage, where each region is treated as an agent. This also serves as the foundation for the centralized training and decentralized execution, thus significantly reducing the communication requirements as only local measurements are required for control. Comparative results with other alternatives on the IEEE 123-nodes and 342-nodes systems demonstrate the superiority of the proposed method.","IEEE","","National Renewable Energy Lab.

Thermal storage is an excellent match for solar energy, but concentrating solar power plants must use high optical concentrations and large plants to be cost competitive. Here, we propose an alternative, solid-state heat engine for solar-thermal conversion consisting of a solar absorber, a thermoradiative cell, and a photovoltaic cell. Heat from the solar absorber or thermal storage drives radiative recombination current in the thermoradiative cell, and its emitted light is used by the photovoltaic cell. Based on the principle of detailed balance, we calculate a limiting solar conversion efficiency of 85% for fully concentrated sunlight and 45% for one sun with an absorber and single-junction cells of equal areas. Solar thermoradiative-photovoltaic systems outperform similar solar thermophotovoltaic converters for low band gaps and practical absorber temperatures, and for a realistic device, this improvement can be up to 7.9% (absolute).","Elsevier","","National Renewable Energy Lab.

"Effect of Surface Texture on Pinhole Formation in SiO<sub>x</sub>-Based Passivated Contacts for High-Performance Silicon Solar Cells","Guthrey, Harvey; Lima Salles, Caroline; Kale, Abhijit S.; Nemeth, William; Page, Matthew; Agarwal, Sumit; Young, David L.; Al-Jassim, Mowafak; Stradins, Paul","14 SOLAR ENERGY; EBIC; oxide passivation; pinholes; pyramid texture; silicon solar cell; passivating contact; surface texture","High-efficiency silicon solar cells rely on some form of passivating contact structure to reduce recombination losses at the crystalline silicon surface and losses at the metal/Si contact interface. One such structure is polycrystalline silicon (poly-Si) on oxide, where heavily doped poly-Si is deposited on a SiO<sub>x</sub> layer grown directly on the crystalline silicon (c-Si) wafer. Depending on the thickness of the SiO<sub>x</sub> layer, the charge carriers can cross this layer by tunneling (<2 nm SiO<sub>x</sub> thickness) or by direct conduction through disruptions in the SiOx, often referred to as pinholes, in thicker SiO<sub>x</sub> layers (>2 nm). In this work, we study structures with tunneling- or pinhole-like SiO<sub>x</sub> contacts grown on pyramidally textured c-Si wafers and expose variations in the SiOx layer properties related to surface morphology using electron-beam-induced current (EBIC) imaging. Using EBIC, we identify and mark regions with potential pinholes in the SiO<sub>x</sub> layer. We further perform high-resolution transmission electron microscopy on the same areas, thus allowing us to directly correlate locally enhanced carrier collection with variations in the structure of the SiO<sub>x</sub> layer. Our results show that the pinholes in the SiO<sub>x</sub> layer preferentially form in different locations based on the annealing conditions used to form the device. With greater understanding of these processes and by controlling the surface texture geometry, there is potential to control the size and spatial distribution of oxide disruptions in silicon solar cells with poly-Si on oxide-type contacts; usually, this is a random phenomenon on polished or planar surfaces. Such control will enable us to consistently produce high-efficiency devices with low recombination currents and low junction resistances using this contact structure.","American Chemical Society (ACS)","","National Renewable Energy Lab.

Strategic PV placement can lower electricity costs by reducing the electricity fed from the grid during on-peak hours, while maintaining PV panel efficiency in terms of the amount of solar radiation received. In this article, we present a framework that identifies the ideal location of PV panels on residential rooftops. Our framework combines energy and environmental simulation, parametric modeling, and optimization to inform PV placement as it relates to and affects the entire community (in terms of both energy use and financial cost), as well as individual buildings. Ensuring that our framework accounts for shading from nearby buildings, different utility rate structures, and different buildings’ energy demand profiles means that existing communities and future housing developments can be optimized for energy savings and PV efficiency. The framework comprises two workflows, each contributing to optimal PV placement with a unique target: (a) maximizing PV panel efficiency (i.e., solar generation) and (b) minimizing operational energy cost considering utility rate structures for operational energy. We apply our framework to a residential community in Fort Collins, Colorado, to demonstrate the optimal PV placement, considering the two workflow targets. Here, we present our results and illustrate the effect of PV location and orientation on solar energy production efficiency and operational energy cost.","AMSE","","National Renewable Energy Lab.

"Steady-state off-design modeling of the supercritical carbon dioxide recompression cycle for concentrating solar power applications with two-tank sensible-heat storage","Neises, Ty","14 SOLAR ENERGY; supercritical carbon dioxide; sCO2; recompression cycle; off-design; concentrating solar power","Concentrating solar power researchers are evaluating the potential of the supercritical carbon dioxide recompression cycle to improve the thermal efficiency and decrease the capital costs of next-generation systems. This analysis investigates the steady-state off-design performance of a recompression cycle integrated with two-tank sensible-heat thermal energy storage as the ambient temperature and heat-transfer fluid (HTF) inlet conditions to the cycle change. This paper presents off-design component models and then cycle convergence and control models to maximize net cycle power output while constraining the high-side pressure and air-cooler fan power to their respective design values and fixing the cycle HTF outlet temperature to its design value. Results show that inventory control and air-cooler fan power are important control parameters that can be optimized to maximize off-design power output as the ambient temperature and HTF mass flow rate diverge from design. The high-side pressure and fan power constraints cause the cycle net power to degrade when the ambient temperature is warmer than the design value, and this study calculates a maximum mass flow rate for hot days above which the cycle cannot achieve the design HTF outlet temperature. Finally, the analysis shows that optimizing compressor shaft speeds can improve cold-day performance by around 1.5 percentage points and part-load performance by up to 2.5 percentage points versus a baseline case with no active compressor control.","Elsevier","","National Renewable Energy Lab.

This dynamic fluttering behavior can grow in amplitude until the panels enter an unstable mode known as torsional galloping which can lead to panel failure or total array destruction. To better understand the physics of the torsional galloping phenomenon and to inform the discussion around panel design and recommended panel stow positions during high wind events, a fluid-structure interaction solver composed of a simulated atmospheric boundary layer with simplified panel structural responses was designed. The simulation choices and features of this solver were informed by the geometry and physical properties of an experimental panel array known to exhibit torsional galloping behavior during hind-wind events. Furthermore, these simulations revealed that the torsional galloping instability is driven by a combination of cyclic vortex shedding from the sun-facing side of the panel and the elastic properties of the torque tube linking the panel assemblies. Testing different stow angles across a range of wind speeds indicates that panels are generally more stable when stowed at negative angles where the leading edge is closer to the ground, hypothesized to be due to ground-blocking effects. These results are supplemented by a discussion of stability trends noted during testing and possible implications when considering multi-row array interactions.","American Institute of Physics (AIP)","","National Renewable Energy Lab.

"A Data-Driven Global Sensitivity Analysis Framework for Three-Phase Distribution System with PVs","Ye, Ketian; Zhao, Junbo; Huang, Can; Duan, Nan; Zhang, Yingchen; Field, Thomas","14 SOLAR ENERGY; ANOVA kernel; distribution system analysis; Gaussian process; global sensitivity analysis; PVs; Sobol indices","Global sensitivity analysis (GSA) of distribution systems with respect to stochastic PV and load variations plays an important role in designing optimal voltage control schemes. This paper proposes a data-driven framework for GSA of distribution systems. In particular, two representative surrogate modeling-based approaches are developed, including the traditional Gaussian process-based and the analysis of variance (ANOVA) kernel ones. The key idea is to develop a surrogate model that captures the hidden global relationship between voltage and real and reactive power injections from the historical data. With the surrogate model, the Sobol indices can be conveniently calculated through either the sampling-based method or the analytical method to assess the global sensitivity of voltage to variations of PV and load power injections. The sampling-based method approximates the Sobol indices using Monte Carlo simulations while the analytical method calculates them by resorting to the ANOVA expansion framework. Comparison results with other model-based GSA methods on the unbalanced three-phase IEEE 37-bus and 123-bus distribution systems show that the proposed framework can achieve much higher computational efficiency with negligible loss of accuracy. The results on a real 240-node distribution system using actual smart meter data further validate the feasibility and scalability of the proposed framework.","IEEE","","National Renewable Energy Lab.

In some cases, municipalities have negotiated renewable energy objectives into these agreements. It is still unclear how many municipalities have exercised this authority and to what effect. From a national dataset of 3500 franchise agreements, we selected five cities that adopted renewable energy or energy efficiency objectives into or alongside their franchise agreements for deeper analysis: Chicago, Illinois; Denver, Colorado; Sarasota, Florida; Minneapolis, Minnesota; and Salt Lake City, Utah. We generated seven key takeaways for other cities considering this pathway to achieve their energy objectives. In summary, municipalities can leverage franchise negotiations to pursue both modest and ambitious clean energy goals (i.e. 100% renewable electricity). This study provides municipalities with critical insight on how they can use this potentially formidable tool to achieve their own energy objectives.","Elsevier","","National Renewable Energy Lab.

We quantify the impacts of climate change on wind and solar electricity generation under high concentrations of greenhouse gases in Texas. We employ mid-twenty-first century climate projections and a high-resolution numerical weather prediction model to generate weather variables in the future and produce wind and solar generation time series. We find that mid-twenty-first century projections based on five global climate models agree on the multiyear average increases across Texas in direct normal irradiance, global horizontal irradiance, surface air temperature, and 100-m wind speed of up to 5%, 4%, 10%, and 1%, respectively. These changes lead to multiyear average relative changes across Texas of -0.6 to +2.5% and of +1.3 to +3.5% in solar and wind capacity factors, respectively, with significant regional, seasonal, and diurnal differences. Areas with low solar resource show an increase in solar capacity factors but reductions in wind capacity factors. Areas with high solar resource show reductions in solar capacity factors. The spatial and temporal differences in our results highlight the importance of using high-resolution data sets to study the potential impacts of climate change on wind and solar power.","Springer","","Oak Ridge National Lab.

This has motivated the field to push perovskites to reach the highest possible performance. One way to increase the efficiency is by fabricating multijunction solar cells, which can split the solar spectrum, reducing thermalization loss. Low-cost all-perovskite tandems have a real chance to soon exceed 30% PCE, which could transform the PV industry. Achieving this goal requires the identification of perovskite sub-cells that are both highly efficient and can be effectively integrated. In this review, it is discussed how to navigate the multiple-choice adventure in choosing between the myriad of options and considerations present when deciding what perovskite materials, contact layers, and processing tools to use. Some of the potential fabrication pitfalls often encountered in MHP based tandem PVs are highlighted, so that they can hopefully be avoided in the future.","Wiley","","National Renewable Energy Lab.

Many of the current computational techniques that use ASIs for this purpose rely on collections of clear-sky images indexed by time of day, solar angle, or both, called clear-sky dictionaries (CSDs). These CSDs act as baselines against which images can be compared to locate and classify clouds within the image frame. CSDs are often compiled by hand, where individuals visually inspect collections of images one at a time to find clear-sky images. This process is not scalable, and it is prone to error. This paper proposes an automated, nonparametric alternative that uses the principles of digital image processing to find clear-sky images within a set of images taken over several days. We use ground-truth measurements of the clearness index to assess the performance of our method, and we show that the images it selects accurately correspond to clear-sky images. We also compare our proposal, which is nonparametric, with a state-of-the-art parametric method. The numerical results indicate that the performance of the method proposed here is superior.","Elsevier","","National Renewable Energy Lab.

This roadmap focuses on solar-to-fuel conversion, solar water splitting, solar photovoltaics and bio-catalysis. It includes dyesensitized solar cells (DSSCs), perovskite solar cells, and organic photovoltaics. Smart engineering of colloidal quantum materials and nanostructured electrodes will improve solar-to-fuel conversion efficiency, as described in the articles by Waiskopf and Banin and Meyer. Semiconductor nanoparticles will also improve solar energy conversion efficiency, as discussed by Boschloo et al. in their article on DSSCs. Perovskite solar cells have advanced rapidly in recent years, including new ideas on 2D and 3D hybrid halide perovskites, as described by Spanopoulos et al. “Next generation” solar cells using multiple exciton generation (MEG) from hot carriers, described in the article by Nozik and Beard, could lead to remarkable improvement in photovoltaic efficiency by using quantization effects in semiconductor nanostructures (quantum dots, wires or wells). These challenges will not be met without simultaneous improvement in nanoscale characterization methods. Terahertz spectroscopy, discussed in the article by Milot et al., is one example of a method that is overcoming the difficulties associated with nanoscale materials characterization by avoiding electrical contacts to nanoparticles, allowing characterization during device operation, and enabling characterization of a single nanoparticle. Besides experimental advances, computational science is also meeting the challenges of nanomaterials synthesis. The article by Kohlstedt and Schatz discusses the computational frameworks being used to predict structure-property relationships in materials and devices, including machine learning methods, with an emphasis on organic photovoltaics. In addition, biohybrid approaches can take advantage of efficient and specific enzyme catalysts. The contribution by Megarity and Armstrong presents the “electrochemical leaf” for improvements in electrochemistry and beyond.

Soiling can be cause of significant losses in certain PV plants and its detection has become essential to ensure a correct mitigation. For this reason, accurate and low-cost monitoring devices are needed. While soiling stations have been traditionally employed to measure the impact of soiling, their high cost and maintenance have led to the development of innovative low-cost optical sensors, such as the device presented in this work and named “DUSST” (Detector Unit for Soiling Spectral Transmittance). The thermal characterization of DUSST’s components and the methodology used to predict soiling transmittance losses are presented in this study.

Here, we present a solution-based process, which achieves passivation and improved electrical performance when very small amounts of oxidized Al<sup>3+</sup> species are deposited at the back surface of CdTe devices. The open circuit voltage (V<sub>oc</sub>) is increased and the fill factor (FF) and photoconversion efficiency (PCE) are optimized when the total amount added corresponds to ~1 monolayer, suggesting that the passivation is surface specific. Addition of further Al<sup>3+</sup> species, present in a sparse alumina-like layer, causes the FF and PCE to drop as the interface layer becomes blocking to current flow. The optimized deposit increases the average baseline PCE for both Cu-free devices and devices where Cu is present as a dopant. The greatest improvement is found when the Al<sup>3+</sup> species are deposited prior to the CdCl<sub>2</sub> activation step and Cu is employed. In this case, the best-cell efficiency was improved from 12.6 to 14.4%. Furthermore, time-resolved photoluminescence measurements at the back surface and quantum efficiency measurements performed at the maximum power point indicate that the performance enhancement is due to a reduction in the interface recombination current at the back surface.","American Chemical Society (ACS)","","National Renewable Energy Lab.

Understanding these demand charge savings from PV—and how behind-the-meter storage can potentially enhance those savings—is essential to understand PV market dynamics and adoption in the coming years. This article explores how these demand charge savings vary with demand charge designs and customer load profiles, modeled for a variety of residential and commercial customers. Our findings indicate that demand charge savings are lowest under a basic, non-coincident demand charge design where the demand charge is based on the maximum demand level over the month, regardless of timing, resulting primarily from the temporal mismatch between the timing of the PV host's demand peak and PV generation. PV provides greater demand charge savings, for both commercial and residential customers, when demand charge designs are based on predefined, daytime peak periods or longer averaging intervals. Demand charge savings from PV combined with storage are almost always greater than the sum of the savings attained through either technology separately. We also explore how well demand charge savings from PV align with corresponding utility savings.","Elsevier","","National Renewable Energy Lab.

To improve performance, CSP research is moving to high-temperature and high-efficiency designs. One technology approach is to use inexpensive, high-temperature heat transfer fluids and storage, integrated with a high-efficiency power cycle such as the supercritical carbon dioxide (sCO<sub>2</sub>) Brayton power cycle. The sCO<sub>2</sub> Brayton power cycle has strong potential to achieve performance targets of 50% thermal-to-electric efficiency and dry cooling at an ambient temperature of up to 40 °C and to reduce the cost of power generation. Solid particles have been proposed as a possible high-temperature heat transfer or storage medium that is inexpensive and stable at high temperatures above 1000 °C. The particle/sCO<sub>2</sub> heat exchanger (HX) provides a connection between the particles and sCO<sub>2</sub> fluid in emerging sCO<sub>2</sub> power cycles. This article presents heat transfer modeling to analyze the particle/sCO<sub>2</sub> HX design and assess design tradeoffs including the HX cost. The heat transfer process was modeled based on a particle/sCO<sub>2</sub> counterflow configuration, and empirical heat transfer correlations for the fluidized bed and sCO<sub>2</sub> were used to calculate heat transfer area and estimate the HX cost. A computational fluid dynamics simulation was applied to characterize particle distribution and fluidization. This article shows a path to achieve the cost and performance objectives for a particle/sCO<sub>2</sub> HX design by using fluidized-bed technology.","ASME","","National Renewable Energy Lab.

In this article we report a two-step bilayer interdiffusion growth process to simultaneously meet both requirements for formamidinium-based low-bandgap mixed tin–lead iodide perovskite solar cells. The bilayer interdiffusion growth process allows for the formation of high-quality and large-grained perovskite films with only 10 mol% volatile methylammonium. Additionally, one-dimensional pyrrolidinium perovskite was applied to passivate the perovskite film and improve the junction quality, which resulted in a carrier lifetime of 1.1 µs and an open circuit voltage of 0.865 V for our perovskite film and device with a bandgap of 1.28 eV. Our strategies enabled a power-conversion efficiency of 20.4% for low-bandgap perovskite solar cells under AM 1.5G illumination.

"AATTENUATION—The Atmospheric Attenuation Model for CSP Tower Plants: A Look-Up Table for Operational Implementation","Hanrieder, Natalie; Ghennioui, Abdellatif; Wilbert, Stefan; Sengupta, Manajit; Zarzalejo, Luis F.","47 OTHER INSTRUMENTATION; 14 SOLAR ENERGY; atmospheric extinction; attenuation loss; transmittance model; solar tower plant; central receiver; solar resource assessment; CSP; solar energy","Attenuation of solar radiation between the receiver and the heliostat field in concentrated solar power (CSP) tower plants can reduce the overall system performance significantly. The attenuation varies strongly with time and the average attenuation at different sites might also vary strongly from each other. If no site specific attenuation data is available, the optimal plant design cannot be determined and rough estimations of the attenuation effect are required leading to high uncertainties of yield analysis calculations. The attenuation is caused mainly by water vapor content and aerosol particles in the lower atmospheric layer above ground. Although several on-site measurement systems have been developed during recent years, attenuation data sets are usually not available to be included during the plant project development. An Atmospheric Attenuation (AATTENUATION) model to derive the atmospheric transmittance between a heliostat and receiver on the basis of common direct normal irradiance (DNI), temperature, relative humidity, and barometric pressure measurements was developed and validated by the authors earlier. The model allows the accurate estimation of attenuation for sites with low attenuation and gives an estimation of the attenuation for less clear sites. However, the site-dependent coefficients of the AATTENUATION model had to be developed individually for each site of interest, which required time-consuming radiative transfer simulations, considering the exact location and altitude, as well as the pre-dominant aerosol type at the location. This strongly limited the application of the model despite its typically available input data. In this manuscript, a look-up table (LUT) is presented which enables the application of the AATTENUATION model at the site of interest without the necessity to perform the according complex radiative transfer calculations for each site individually. This enables the application of the AATTENUATION model for virtually all resource assessments for tower plants and in an operational mode in real time within plant monitoring systems around the world. The LUT also facilitates the generation of solar attenuation maps on the basis of long-term meteorological data sets which can be considered during resource assessment for CSP tower plant projects. The LUTs are provided together with this manuscript as supplementary files. The LUT for the AATTENUATION model was developed for a solar zenith angle (SZA) grid of 1°, an altitude grid of 100 m, 7 different standard aerosol types and the standard AFGL atmospheres for mid-latitudes and the tropics. The LUT was tested against the original version of the AATTENUATION model at 4 sites in Morocco and Spain, and it was found that the additional uncertainty introduced by the application of the LUT is negligible. With the information of latitude, longitude, altitude above mean sea level, DNI, relative humidity (RH), ambient temperature (Tair), and barometric pressure (bp), the attenuation can be now derived easily for each site of interest.","MDPI AG","","National Renewable Energy Lab.

The solder joints experience stresses from thermal cycling and constant elevated temperatures (40 °C-70 °C) in regular field operation leading to thermo-mechanical fatigue and intermetallic compound formation. To study the end-of-life wear-out mechanisms and to obtain activation energy of solder bond degradation, here two field-aged modules from Arizona-a 21-year-old Solarex MSX60 module (with Sn62Pb36Ag2 at the solder joints) and an 18-year-old Siemens M55 module (with Sn60Pb40 at the solder joints)-underwent 800 and 400 modified thermal cycles, respectively. Using three heating blankets, each module had three temperature zones maintained at 85, 95, and 105 °C during the 15-min hot dwell time of the thermal cycle. Cell-level series resistance data obtained from three temperature zones enabled the calculation of activation energy for solder bond degradation for the MSX60 and the M55 modules to be 0.12 eV and 0.35 eV, respectively. From each temperature zone in both modules, busbar-solder samples were obtained, imaged through SEM, and analyzed with energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy. In the MSX60 module with traces of Ag in the solder material, phase segregation and growth were primarily observed at high temperatures. For M55 modules without Ag in the solder material, major phase segregation was observed in all temperature zones. The IMC thickness for both modules increased with increasing module temperature. The beneficial effect of Ag in solder material on mitigating solder bond degradation is presented.","IEEE","","National Renewable Energy Lab.

"A non-intrusive optical (NIO) approach to characterize heliostats in utility-scale power tower plants: Methodology and in-situ validation","Mitchell, Rebecca A.; Zhu, Guangdong","14 SOLAR ENERGY; CSP; heliostats; in-situ optical characterization; non-intrusive method; power tower","No reliable in-situ optical characterization tool is available that can efficiently and accurately measure various optical errors of individual heliostats in a utility-scale power-tower plant. Here, an innovative non-intrusive optical (NIO) approach is proposed to measure mirror surface slope error, mirror facet canting error, and heliostat tracking error based on reflection images using the natural target—the tower—in a heliostat field. The NIO approach adopts various techniques in photogrammetry, reflectometry, and geometrical optics to first determine the camera position and the actual tower position with respect to the heliostat. Then, Snell’s law is applied to find the surface normal at the reflection point or line of a reflection image and derive the surface slope error, mirror facet canting error, and heliostat tracking error accordingly. In addition, an in-situ validation is performed to demonstrate the feasibility of the NIO approach. Analysis with multiple sets of reflection images on one single heliostat of interest demonstrates that the NIO method can achieve a measurement uncertainty of 0.22 mrad for mirror facet slope error (root-mean-square) at the given test conditions. The sensitivity of measurement uncertainty to various parameters will be presented in a separate work. In the future, state-of-the-art unmanned aerial systems (UAS) are planned to perform the efficient image collection with a goal to complete the survey across a utility-scale field of over 10,000 heliostats within one or a few days depending on the number of UASs. The development of the NIO approach is expected to fill the critical gap for successful solar-field operation and maintenance, which is necessary for the global growth of the solar power-tower technology. The NIO approach can also be applied to any relevant industry requiring high-precision mirror surface shape characterization.","Elsevier","","National Renewable Energy Lab.

"Dynamic hosting capacity analysis for distributed photovoltaic resources—Framework and case study","Jain, Akshay Kumar; Horowitz, Kelsey; Ding, Fei; Sedzro, Kwami Senam; Palmintier, Bryan; Mather, Barry; Jain, Himanshu","14 SOLAR ENERGY; distributed photovoltaic resources; dynamic hosting capacity; quasi static time series analysis","Distributed photovoltaic systems can cause adverse distribution system impacts, including voltage violations at customer locations and thermal overload of lines, transformers, and other equipment resulting from high current. The installed capacity at which violations first occur and above which would require system upgrades is called the hosting capacity. Current static methods for determining hosting capacity tend to either consider infrequent worst-case snapshots in time and/or capture coarse time and spatial resolution. Because the duration of violations cannot be captured with these traditional methods, the metric thresholds used in these studies conservatively use the strictest constraints given in operating standards, even though both worse voltage performance and higher overloads may be temporarily acceptable. However, assessing the full details requires accurately capturing time-dependence, voltage-regulating equipment operations, and performance of advanced controls-based mitigation techniques. In this paper, we propose a dynamic distributed photovoltaic hosting capacity methodology to address these issues by conducting power flow analysis for a full year. A key contribution is the formulation of time aware metrics to take these annual results and identify the hosting capacity. Through a case study, we show that this approach can more fully capture grid impacts of distributed photovoltaic than traditional methods and the dynamic hosting capacity was 60%–200% higher than the static hosting capacity in this case study.","Elsevier","","National Renewable Energy Lab.

"Structure, Morphology, and Photovoltaic Implications of Halide Alloying in Lead-Free Cs<sub>3</sub>Sb<sub>2</sub>Cl<sub>x</sub>I<sub>9-x</sub> 2D-Layered Perovskites","Paul, Goutam; Pal, Amlan J.; Larson, Bryon W.","14 SOLAR ENERGY; halide alloying; layered perovskite; lead-free; optoelectronic properties; photovoltaic","Compositional tuning has been a major driving force behind the excellent optoelectronic properties observed in typical Pb-based perovskites. For lead-free perovskite derivatives, a challenge to understanding the connection between compositional tuning and intrinsic optoelectronic properties, hence a barrier towards boosting their performance, comes from the fact that multiple crystalline substructures can form based on composition, film processing, or both. Especially with lower dimensional (0D, 1D, 2D) substructures, the particular polymorph present in the film can be a greater determinant of optoelectronic properties than the composition itself. Herein, we report a simple method to alloy the halide site in all-inorganic lead-free Cs<sub>3</sub>Sb<sub>2</sub>I<sub>9</sub> films while maintaining a consistent 2D-layered substructure, as a means to independently study the photovoltaic implications of halide substitution. We use a broad suite of spectroscopy and device measurements to identify an optimal stoichiometric substitution of chloride for iodide (~ 8 mol%, measured) that balances both intrinsic and bulk optoelectronic properties to achieve a top power conversion efficiency of 2.2%. This work underscores the importance of controlling substructure while investigating the impacts of compositional tuning for the development of lead-free perovskites, and more broadly validates the approach towards realizing lead-free alternative perovskite solar technologies.","Wiley","","National Renewable Energy Lab.

"Advancing reliability assessments of photovoltaic modules and materials using combined-accelerated stress testing","Owen-Bellini, Michael; Hacke, Peter; Miller, David C.; Kempe, Michael D.; Spataru, Sergiu; Tanahashi, Tadanori; Mitterhofer, Stefan; Jankovec, Marko; Topic, Marko","14 SOLAR ENERGY; accelerated aging; backsheet; combined stress; DuraMAT; reliability","Previously undiscovered failure modes in photovoltaic (PV) modules continue to emerge in field installations despite passing protocols for design qualification and quality assurance. Failure to detect these modes prior to widespread use could be attributed to the limitations of present-day standard accelerated stress tests (ASTs), which are primarily designed to identify known degradation or failure modes at the time of development by applying simultaneous or sequential stress factors (usually two at most). Here, we introduce an accelerated testing method known as the combined-accelerated stress test (C-AST), which simultaneously combines multiple stress factors of the natural environment. Simultaneous combination of multiple stress factors allows for improved identification of failure modes with better ability to detect modes not known a priori. A demonstration experiment was conducted that reproduced the field-observed cracking of polyamide- (PA-) and polyvinylidene fluoride (PVDF)–based backsheet films, a failure mode that was not detected by current design qualification and quality assurance testing requirements. In this work, a two-phase testing protocol was implemented. The first cycle (“Tropical”) is a predominantly high-humidity and high-temperature test designed to replicate harsh tropical climates. The second cycle (“Multi-season”) was designed to replicate drier and more temperate conditions found in continental or desert climates. Testing was conducted on 2 × 2-cell crystalline-silicon cell miniature modules constructed with both ultraviolet (UV)–transmitting and UV-blocking encapsulants. Cracking failures were observed within a cumulative 120 days of the Tropical condition for one of the PA-based backsheets and after 84 days of Tropical cycle followed by 42 days of the Multi-season cycle for the PVDF-based backsheet, which are both consistent with failures seen in fielded modules. In addition to backsheet cracking, degradation modes were observed including solder/interconnect fatigue, various light-induced degradation modes, backsheet delamination, discoloration, corrosion, and cell cracking. The ability to simultaneously apply multiple stress factors may allow many of the test sequences within the standardized design qualification procedure to be performed using a single test setup.","Wiley","","National Renewable Energy Lab.

For example, solar cell efficiency can change enormously by adjusting TCO properties. At the same time, these TCO properties can shift during the deposition of other layers, anneals, and device operation. An ideal TCO should have tunable but stable electro-optical properties. Here, we deposit SnO<sub>2</sub>, (Mg,Zn)O (MZO), and Ga:(Mg,Zn)O (GMZO) films on glass and measure electro-optical characteristics before and after reducing, inert, oxidizing, and CdCl2 anneals over a range of temperatures. Electron density generally increases in the progression from oxidizing to inert and reducing ambients. SnO<sub>2</sub> is relatively stable compared to MZO but has less flexibility for interface engineering. We investigate GMZO as a similar but more stable alternative to MZO.The addition of Ga to MZO has significant effects on electron density and improves electro-optical stability, which can be advantageous for semiconductor applications. Furthermore, we demonstrate that GMZO can be readily incorporated into solar cells.","IOP Publishing","","National Renewable Energy Lab.

"Long-term spatial and temporal solar resource variability over America using the NSRDB version 3 (1998–2017)","Habte, Aron; Sengupta, Manajit; Gueymard, Christian; Golnas, Anastasios; Xie, Yu","14 SOLAR ENERGY; long-term spatial; National Solar Radiation Database; NSRDB; solar resource; temporal","The study assesses the long-term spatial and temporal solar resource variability in America using the 20-year National Renewable Energy Laboratory's (NREL's) National Solar Radiation Database (NSRDB). Specifically, the coefficient of variation (COV) is used to analyze the spatial and temporal (interannual and seasonal) variability. Further, both spatial and temporal long-term variability are analyzed using the Köppen-Geiger climate classification. The temporal variability is found that, on average, the continental United States (CONUS) COV reaches up to 5% for global horizontal irradiance (GHI) and 10% for direct normal irradiance (DNI), and that the NSRDB domain's COV is roughly twice that of CONUS. For the seasonal variability analysis, the winter months are found to exhibit higher COV than the other seasons. In particular, December exhibits the highest variability, reaching on average 30% for DNI and 20% for GHI over various areas. On the other hand, the summer months demonstrate significantly lower variability, reaching only less than 20% for DNI and 10% for GHI, on average. Similarly, the spatial variability is analyzed by comparing each pixel to its neighbors. The long-term spatial variability is found to increase with the number of neighboring pixels being considered, which is equivalent to an increase in distance (within a 100-km x 100-km square grid). As expected, the DNI spatial variability is higher than that of GHI. Moreover, the annual solar irradiance anomalies are found to reach ±25% for both GHI and DNI (and even exceed those value in some instances) during each year of the 20-year period.","Elsevier","","National Renewable Energy Lab.

"Potential scalability of a cost-effective purification method for MgCl2-Containing salts for next-generation concentrating solar power technologies","Zhao, Youyang; Vidal, Judith","14 SOLAR ENERGY; molten chloride; concentrating solar power; purification; MgOHCl; corrosion control","Next-generation concentrating solar power (CSP) technology requires a high-temperature heat-transfer fluid and thermal energy storage media. Molten MgCl<sub>2</sub>-KCl-NaCl is considered a potential candidate salt due to its thermophysical properties. However, MgCl<sub>2</sub> presents various challenges because of its hygroscopic nature. To keep corrosion under control, this molten chloride needs to remain free of hydrates and other impurities. Here, we have developed an effective purification method for MgCl<sub>2</sub>-containing salts by 1) combining known laboratory-scale, batch-style thermal and chemical purification processes to enable scalable, continuous-style processes for commercial next-generation CSP operation; 2) improving overall efficiency and minimizing the major corrosive impurity MgOHCl by optimizing key engineering parameters such as heating temperature/time and amount of elemental Mg addition; and 3) investigating the addition of halite (NaCl) to carnallite (KMgCl<sub>3</sub>) to reduce the liquidus temperature. Laboratory-scale results suggest that 1) adding 6.5 wt% of halite and less than 0.1 wt% of elemental Mg to commercial carnallite and 2) following a heating schedule to at least 650 °C with ~3 h of holding time at that temperature can produce a ternary MgCl<sub>2</sub>-KCl-NaCl salt composition with a low liquidus temperature of about 400 °C. It also reduces the presence of the corrosive impurity, MgOHCl, from ~1 to 2 wt.% to ~0.1 wt%. Findings of these key engineering parameters should provide a pathway toward a scalable, continuous-style salt-purification process at a scale of metric tons per hour that can produce a corrosion-controlled chloride molten salt for CSP applications.","Elsevier","","National Renewable Energy Lab.

Perovskite QD solar cells have demonstrated efficiencies of 16.6%, greater than that of any other QD material system. While the efficiency lags behind the best thin-film perovskite devices, these solar cells could have advantages over the thin-film versions in terms of processability, phase stability, and high open-circuit voltages. However, some operating principles behind perovskite quantum dot device stacks and the associated electric field properties are still unknown. Here, we characterize the junction structure within perovskite QD solar cells, by exposing functioning cross-sections and using nanometer-scale Kelvin probe force microscopy to offer insight into the selection and performance of charge selective contacts. We also evaluated various solar cell device architectures with different selective contacts to isolate the role of each junction in device performance. We show that in high-performance n-i-p architectures, both electron- and hole-transport layer (HTL) interfaces possess a strong electric field, but in the case of the inverted p-i-n architecture, we find that high interfacial recombination at the HTL/QD junction is responsible for subpar device performance. Perovskite QD and thin film materials can synergistically be combined to offer more design flexibility in PV devices, and here we demonstrate that the interface between perovskite thin films and QDs are relatively benign and amenable for synergistic device design.","Elsevier","","National Renewable Energy Lab.

These nanometer-sized semiconducting crystals can be suitably mass-produced and size-tuned via cost-effective solution-based synthetic routes to operate in the quantum size confinement regime, endowing them with a wide array of exotic optical and electronic properties. While the first potential market entry could be in displays and in niche applications such as “internet-of-things”, ultimately, the technology has the potential to influence large-scale terrestrial power generation, because it is amenable to high-throughput synthesis from Earth-abundant materials and large-area solution-based coating techniques and can be air-stable. In this Review, we chronicle the recent advances that have propelled QD PV toward commercialization and highlight potential areas for further progress. We present an account of the material compositions being explored as QDs and their various benefits, major chemical passivation and doping strategies that have been developed to allay QD surface traps, and advanced device designs deployed to maximize charge extraction. We also discuss pathways to >20% efficient QD PV and describe recent advances in high-precision and autonomous synthesis of such materials. With recent demonstrations of scalable synthesis of high-quality QDs, smart manufacturing of QDs and QD solids, and fabrication of stable solar cells under ambient conditions, we suggest that the technology is on the road to achieving maturity and technological relevance and that gigawatt per year distributed panel production sites may be within reach.","American Chemical Society (ACS)","","National Renewable Energy Lab.

Such testing also reduces financial risks for module manufacturers and customers. This work examines the expected impact of certain defects in silicon (Si) modules during standardized accelerated testing. Specifically, the behavior of boron-oxygen (BO) light-induced degradation (LID) and light- and elevated temperature-induced degradation (LeTID) are simulated during some of the stress tests in IEC 61215. LID and LeTID reaction rates at qualification temperatures are estimated from earlier published data. It is demonstrated the BO-related LID may cause some false positives and false negatives when IEC 61215 tests are performed as prescribed in the 2016 published version. Possible stabilization steps to avoid these false results are suggested. State changes for the defects causing LeTID occur much more slowly than those causing BO LID, and therefore LeTID is predicted to have a lesser impact on the IEC 61215 stress tests results.","Elsevier","","National Renewable Energy Lab.

Quasi-static time-series (QSTS) simulations are increasingly being utilized to study the implementation of these inverter functions as alternatives to traditional circuit upgrades. However, QSTS analyses can yield significantly different results based on the availability and resolution of input data and other modeling considerations. In this paper, we quantified the uncertainty of QSTS-based curtailment evaluations for two different grid-support functions (autonomous Volt-Var and centralized PV curtailment for preventing reverse power conditions) through extensive sensitivity analyses and hardware testing. We found that Volt-Var curtailment evaluations were most sensitive to poor inverter convergence (-56.4%), PV time-series data (-18.4% to +16.5%), QSTS resolution (-15.7%), and inverter modeling uncertainty (+14.7%), while the centralized control case was most sensitive to load modeling (-26.5% to +21.4%) and PV time-series data (-6.0% to +12.4%). These findings provide valuable insights for improving the reliability and accuracy of QSTS analyses for evaluating curtailment and other PV impact studies.","Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers","","Sandia National Lab.

We spin-coat nanoparticle suspensions onto GaAs thin-film device stacks. The suspensions dry in seconds, forming crack networks that we use as templates through which to electroplate the solar cells’ front metal grids. For the first time, we show that heating the crack template allows it to flow and refill cracks, which decreases crack footprint and improves final grid transmittance. We demonstrate 24.7%-efficient single-junction GaAs solar cells using vacuum-free CFL grids. These devices are only 1.7% (absolute) less efficient than the baseline grids patterned by photolithography with the loss mostly resulting from the reduced transparency of the CFL pattern. Additional optimization could decrease this difference. Initial cost modeling suggests that CFL is more scalable than photolithography: In particular, CFL’s lower materials and equipment costs could greatly reduce the levelized cost of electricity of III–V PV at scale, a potential step toward terrestrial deployment.","American Chemical Society (ACS)","","National Renewable Energy Lab.

We evaluate the inverter under simulated use conditions with heat run tests to find the highest operating temperatures reached by these components. The procedures are demonstrated in this study with a 4-kVA class string inverter. The maximum temperature of the DC bus link capacitors was determined to be 76.4°C when the ambient temperature was at the inverter's maximum rated temperature of 60°C with derating occurring. On the other hand, the power transistor module's maximum temperature using the heat sink temperature as the index, 92.6°C, occurred in an ambient of 40.8°C when derating was not occurring. The conditions found for upper temperatures exhibited by these components are, respectively, proposed for implementation in the dry heat and thermal cycling tests in the IEC 62093 “Power conversion equipment for photovoltaic systems – Design qualification testing” international standard draft so that the levels applied in the tests are in proportion to those experienced in the field.

"Transient Evolution of the Built-in Field at Junctions of GaAs","Chen, Xihan; Pekarek, Ryan; Gu, Jing; Zakutayev, Andriy; Hurst, Katherine; Neale, Nathan; Yang, Ye; Beard, Matt","14 SOLAR ENERGY; GaAs photoelectrodes; optoelectronic and phtocatalytic applications; transient evolution","Built-in electric fields at semiconductor junctions are vital for optoelectronic and photocatalytic applications since they govern the movement of photogenerated charge carriers near critical surfaces and interfaces. Here, we exploit transient photoreflectance (TPR) spectroscopy to probe the dynamical evolution of the built-in field for n-GaAs photoelectrodes upon photoexcitation. The transient fields are modelled in order to quantitatively describe the surface carrier dynamics that influence those fields. Furthermore, the photoinduced surface field at different types of junctions between n-GaAs and n-TiO<sub>2</sub>, Pt, electrolyte and p-NiO are examined, and the results reveal that surface Fermi-level pinning, ubiquitous for many GaAs surfaces, can have beneficial consequences that impact photoelectrochemical applications. That is, Fermi-level pinning results in the primary surface carrier dynamics being invariant to the contacting layer and promotes beneficial carrier separation. For example, when p-NiO is deposited there is no Fermi-level equilibration that modifies the surface field, but photogenerated holes are promoted to the n-GaAs/p-NiO interface and can transfer into defect mid-gap states within the p-NiO resulting in an elongated charge separation time and those transferred holes can participate in chemical reactions. In contrast, when the Fermi-level is un-pinned via molecular surface functionalization on p-GaAs, the carriers undergo surface recombination faster due to a smaller built-in field, thus potentially degrading their photochemical performance.","American Chemical Society (ACS)","","National Renewable Energy Lab.

However, utility-scale solar energy development is land intensive and its large-scale installation can have negative impacts on the environment. In particular, solar energy infrastructure can require extensive landscape modification that transforms soil ecological functions, thereby impacting hydrologic, vegetative, and carbon dynamics. However, reintroducing native vegetation to solar PV sites may be a means of restoring their soils. To this end, we investigated critical soil physical and chemical parameters at a revegetated photovoltaic array and an adjacent reference grassland in Colorado, United States. Seven years after revegetation, we found that carbon and nitrogen remained lower in the PV soil than in the reference soil and contained a greater fraction of coarse particles. We also found that the PV modules introduced heterogeneity in the soil moisture distribution, with precipitation accumulating along the lower edges of panels. The redistribution of soil moisture by panel arrays could potentially be used in concert with planting strategies to maximize plant growth or minimize soil erosion, and should be considered when evaluating the potential to co-locate vegetation with solar infrastructure.","Frontiers Research Foundation","","National Renewable Energy Lab.

The model predicts cycle off-design performance under various boundary conditions, including molten salt inlet temperature, mass flow rate, and ambient temperature. The model is validated using industry performance data and benchmarked with results from the literature. A complete concentrating solar power plant, inclusive of solar heliostat field and receiver, is then considered, by implementing the Rankine cycle off-design performance results into the National Renewable Energy Laboratory’s System Advisor Model software, which includes a tool that determines optimal power production schedules. The work improves upon the current System Advisor Model by updating off-design performance characteristics. A case study demonstrates the impact of cycle off-design behavior on annual performance for a stand-alone concentrating solar power system and a concentrating solar power-photovoltaic hybrid system. In addition, we demonstrate how cycle off-design performance influences optimal operator dispatch decisions and, thereby, overall system design and economics. We conclude that off-design cycle performance impacts “optimal” sub-system sizing, especially for a concentrating solar power-photovoltaic hybrid configuration in which concentrating solar power must dispatch in conjunction with photovoltaic generation.","Elsevier","","National Renewable Energy Lab.

We find that this fleet of utility-scale PV projects has generally lived up to ex ante expectations for first-year performance but that subsequent system-level degradation - found to be -1.3%/year (±0.2%) - has, on average, been worse than both ex ante expectations (commonly -0.5%/year) and results from past studies (ranging from -0.8%/year to -1.0%/year). We emphasize that -1.3%/year is a system-level estimate that captures more than just module degradation (e.g., including soiling, balance of plant degradation, and downtime for maintenance and/or other events). A side analysis of a variety of project characteristics suggests that system-level degradation rates tend to be of lower magnitude among newer projects and larger projects and at sites with lower long-term average temperatures.","American Institute of Physics (AIP)","","National Renewable Energy Lab.

We report a large-scale study on adhesive degradation was conducted on 37 field-exposed modules, that spanned 19 different module manufacturers, that were deployed among six Köppen–Geiger climatic zones, and that were fielded between 0 and 28 years. Six outer layer polymer classes were identified among the backsheets: polyamide (PA), polyethylene terephthalate (PET), polyvinyl fluoride (PVF), polyvinylidene fluoride (PVDF), fluoroethylene vinyl ether copolymer (FEVE), and tetrafluoroethylene hexafluoropropylene vinylidene fluoride copolymer (THV). Two adhesion tests were used to measure the adhesive strength: the wedge test and the width-tapered single-cantilever beam (SCB) test. Adhesion energies were compared across exposure time and Köppen–Geiger climatic zone. Many of the PET-, PVF-, and PVDF-based backsheets experienced degradation of the adhesive layer between the backsheet outer and core layers. A consistent trend of decreasing adhesion energy with exposure time was observed in five out of the six backsheet types. Trends among adhesion energy and climatic zone, while expected, were not observed, possibly due to broad ranges in temperature, humidity, and precipitation defining Köppen–Geiger climatic zones. The cantilever beam measurements produced an upper cutoff of approximately 100 J/m<sup>2</sup>, above which no modules exhibited field delamination. The results are part of a two-part study quantifying adhesion in both field-weathered and indoor-exposed PV backsheets.","Elsevier","","National Renewable Energy Lab.

"Distributed PV generation estimation using multi‐rate and event‐driven Kalman kriging filter","Alam, SM Shafiul; Florita, Anthony R.; Hodge, Bri‐Mathias","14 SOLAR ENERGY; auto-regressive model; k-means clustering; Kalman filter; Kriging","The ever-growing penetration of cost-effective photovoltaic (PV) panels within the distribution grid requires a robust and efficient method for PV system monitoring. Especially, the geographical proximity of PV panels can play an important role in lowering the dimension of measurements required for full system observability. Furthermore, the direct impact of variable cloud formation and uncertain propagation necessitates the development and validation of a spatiotemporal model. Accordingly, this study presents the modelling and validation of the spatiotemporal variability of solar power indices at 1 minute resolution for the scale of a residential neighbourhood. The spatiotemporal model is then applied to a Multi-Rate and Event-DRIven Kalman Kriging (MREDRIKK) filter to dynamically estimate behind-the-meter PV generation. The Kriging step exploits spatial correlations to estimate PV power output at locations from where measurements are unobserved. The multi-rate feature of the MREDRIKK filter enables the sampling of measurements at a rate much lower than the temporal dynamics of the associated states. A comprehensive study is undertaken to investigate the effect of multi-rate and event-driven measurement updates on the performance of the MREDRIKK filter. In addition, the superior performance of MREDRIKK filter is represented as compared to the persistence method irrespective of the observation size.","Institution of Engineering and Technology (IET)","","National Renewable Energy Lab.

This method provides space selectivity for devices with a planar multi-layered structure, effectively amplifying current noise contributions coming from the most resistive element of the stack. In the studied solar cells, we observe near full-scale shot noise, indicating the dominance of noise generation by a single source, likely the interface between the perovskite and the spiro-organic 2,2',7,7'-tetrakis(N,N-di-p-methoxyphenyl-amine)9,9'-spirobifluorene hole-transport layer. In this paper, we argue that the strong 1/f noise term has contributions from both the perovskite layer and interfaces. It displays a non-ideal dependence on photocurrent, S $\propto$ I<sup>1.4</sup> (instead of usual S $\propto$ I<sup>2</sup>), which is likely due to current-induced halide migration. Finally, we observe generation–recombination noise. We argue that this contribution is due to bimolecular recombination in the perovskite bulk absorption layer. Extrapolating our results, we estimate that at standard 1 sun illumination, the electron–hole recombination time is 5 microseconds.","American Institute of Physics (AIP)","","National Renewable Energy Lab.

Many studies have examined the variability and uncertainty of such generators and described how generation and load can be balanced for a wide variety of annual energy penetrations, at timescales from seconds to years. Another important characteristic of these resources is asynchronicity, the result of using inverters to interface the prime energy source with the power system as opposed to synchronous generators. Unlike synchronous generators, whose frequency of alternating current (AC) injection is physically coupled to the rotation of the machine itself, inverter based asynchronous generators do not share the same physical coupling with the generated frequency. These subtle differences impact the operations of power systems developed around the characteristics of synchronous generators. In this paper we review current knowledge and open research questions concerning the interplay between asynchronous inverter-based resources (IBRs) and cycle- to second-scale power system dynamics, with a focus on how stability and control may be impacted or need to be achieved differently when there are high instantaneous penetrations of IBRs across an interconnection. This work does not seek to provide a comprehensive review of the latest developments, but is instead intended to be accessible to any reader with an engineering background and an interest in power systems and renewable energy. As such, the paper includes basic material on power electronics, control schemes for IBRs, and power system stability; and uses this background material to describe potential impacts of IBRs on power system stability, operational challenges associated with large amounts of distributed IBR generation, and modern power system simulation trends driven by IBR characteristics.","Elsevier","","National Renewable Energy Lab.

Two such loss components are degradation rates and soiling losses. However, in systems where both these phenomena exist, quantifying them is not straightforward because of their combined effect on the power output. In this article, we propose an algorithm that iteratively decomposes a performance index time series of a PV system into a soiling component, a degradation component, and a seasonal component. This makes it possible to simultaneously estimate soiling losses and degradation rates of PV systems. Bootstrapping is used to estimate confidence intervals so that both data uncertainty and model uncertainty is taken into account. Based on simulated data we show that this method makes more accurate estimates of soiling losses and degradation rates than relevant state-of-the-art methods.","Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers","","National Renewable Energy Lab.

We identify a previously unseen interfacial degradation mechanism concerning the use of a MoO<sub>x</sub> interlayer, which was originally added to increase operational stability. Specifically, the hole-transport layer/MoO<sub>x</sub> interface buckles under illumination at 70 °C, which leads to delamination and rapid losses of short-circuit current density corresponding to an average $t_{80}$ of ~55 h. By judiciously evaluating various hole-transport layers, interlayers, and contacts, we find that replacing the MoO<sub>x</sub> with a VO<sub>x</sub> interlayer, regardless of the other components in the solar cell, alleviates this buckling issue due to its higher activation barrier toward crystallization, leading to significant gains in PSC operational stability. Unencapsulated devices aged in an ambient atmosphere with a VO<sub>x</sub> interlayer retain 71% of their initial PCE on average after constant illumination and bias at 70 °C for 1100 h ($t_{80}$ ~ 645 h). Currently, this is the highest temperature reported for the operational stability of unencapsulated n-i-p PSCs aged in air. Identification of a new facet of the complex degradation mechanisms in PSCs will allow for targeted acceleration testing to speed the deployment of low-cost, long-lasting electricity generation under realistic operating temperatures.","American Chemical Society (ACS)","","National Renewable Energy Lab.

We tested the ability of SSTDR to detect and locate single-cell mini-modules and full-sized PV modules, which were intentionally damaged by impacts with a hammer (breaking the glass and damaging the silicon below) or by cutting through some or all busbars. Damage to the glass and silicon of cells was detected and located within a small string of minimodules.

"Controllable Solar Flux Heating for Freeze Recovery in Molten Salt Parabolic Trough Collectors","Imponenti, Luca; Shininger, Ryan; Gawlik, Keith; Price, Hank; Zhu, Guangdong","14 SOLAR ENERGY; freeze protection and recovery; molten salt; parabolic trough; solar flux heating","In molten-salt parabolic trough plants, the melting process is particularly important for freeze recovery of salt that is solidified in a collector loop, should such an event occur. Currently impedance heating is expected for freeze recovery of the collector loops, but this method can be expensive. A lower-cost alternative is proposed to use controllable concentrated solar flux directly from the parabolic mirrors to thaw salt that is frozen in the collector. A computational fluid dynamics model was developed to explore the solidification and melting processes of molten salt in a parabolic trough receiver and to assess the viability of this concept. Results indicate that concentrated solar heating has the potential to melt frozen salt in 5.6 h, compared to that in 8.8 h for a 300 W m-1 impedance heating system. At the same time, controllable solar flux heating introduces nonuniform solar fluxes on the receiver surface, which can induce significant thermal stress on the receiver tube. A preliminary stress analysis indicates that the temperature difference across the receiver tube should be maintained below about 70 °C for heating up to 300 °C at internal pressures ≤10 bar. At these conditions, freeze recovery using solar flux heating will not significantly affect receiver lifetime. These results suggest that controllable solar flux heating could effectively supplement or replace impedance heating in the freeze recovery system. Incorporating this methodology in future parabolic trough concentrating solar power plants is an opportunity for capital and operational cost-savings.","ASME","","National Renewable Energy Lab.

"Destructive reverse bias pinning in perovskite/silicon tandem solar modules caused by perovskite hysteresis under dynamic shading","Qian, Jiadong; Ernst, Marco; Walter, Daniel; Mahmud, Md Arafat; Hacke, Peter; Weber, Klaus; Al-Jassim, Mowafak; Blakers, Andrew","14 SOLAR ENERGY; perovskite; shading; silicon tandem","In this work, we demonstrate how perovskite hysteresis can result in permanent reductions in power output in perovskite/silicon tandem modules—including irreversible hotspot-induced damage—from only brief periods of shading. We show that reverse bias events in which a perovskite cell is biased above a threshold voltage—which in this work we find to be as low as –1.1 V—produces a temporary reduction in power output that is of sufficient magnitude to keep the cell pinned in reverse bias after the shading event ends. As a hysteretic phenomena, this crucial failure mode may be overlooked by static models of perovskite-based solar cells. Higher reverse bias voltages exacerbate the temporary reduction in short-circuit photocurrent, which is also sensitive to the level of illumination under reverse bias. Numerical device modelling demonstrates that this effect is consistent with our understanding of perovskite hysteresis as a consequence of mobile ion-electron coupling controlling rates of non-radiative recombination over time. Measurements of the dynamic response of single-junction perovskite cells are extrapolated to two-terminal and four-terminal perovskite/silicon tandem module modelling. We validate these models with measurements from an equivalent electronic circuit that represents a two-terminal perovskite–silicon tandem mini module. Two module-level solutions are discussed that address this issue, which includes increasing the number of bypass diodes and choosing better suited silicon bottom cells with higher shunter resistance in two-terminal tandem modules.","Royal Society of Chemistry","","National Renewable Energy Lab.

By controlling the pre-selenization conditions of the back contact prior to the growth of polycrystalline (Ag,Cu)(In,Ga)Se<sub>2</sub> absorbers and subsequently exposing them to various stresses (light soaking and dark-heat), we explore in this paper the nature and role of metastable defects on the electro-optical and photovoltaic performance of high-efficiency solar cell materials and devices. Positron annihilation spectroscopy indicates that dark-heat exposure results in an increase in the concentration of the selenium–copper divacancy complex (V<sub>Se</sub>–V<sub>Cu</sub>), attributed to depassivation of donor defects. Deep-level optical spectroscopy finds a corresponding increase of a defect at Ev+0.98 eV, and deep-level transient spectroscopy suggests that this increase is accompanied by a decrease in the concentration of mid-bandgap recombination centers. Time-resolved photoluminescence excitation spectroscopy data are consistent with the presence of the V<sub>Se</sub>–V<sub>Cu</sub> divacancy complex, which may act as a shallow trap for the minority carriers. Light-soaking experiments are consistent with the V<sub>Se</sub>–V<sub>Cu</sub> optical cycle proposed by Lany and Zunger, resulting in the conversion of shallow traps into recombination states that limit the effective minority carrier recombination time (and the associated carrier diffusion length) and an increase in the doping density that limits carrier extraction in photovoltaic devices.","American Institute of Physics (AIP)","","National Renewable Energy Lab.

As thin-film cadmium telluride (CdTe) solar cells gain prominence, one particular challenge is optimizing contacts and their interfaces to transfer charge without losses in efficiency. Back contact recombination is still significant and will prevent CdTe solar technology from reaching its full potential in device efficiency, and transparent back contacts have not been developed for bifacial solar technology or multijunction solar cells. To address these challenges, this study investigates sputtered CuxZn1-xS as a p-type semi-transparent back contact material to thin-film polycrystalline CdTe solar cells at Cu concentrations x = 0.30, 0.45, and 0.60. This material is selected for its high hole conductivity (160-2120 S cm-1), wide optical band gap (2.25-2.75 eV), and variable ionization potential (approximately 6-7 eV) that can be aligned to that of CdTe. We report that without device optimization, CdTe solar cells with these CuxZn1-xS back contacts perform as well as control cells with standard ZnTe:Cu back contacts. We observe no reduction in external quantum efficiency, low contact barrier heights of approximately 0.3 eV, and carrier lifetimes on par with those of baseline CdTe. These cells are relatively stable over one year in air, with VOC and efficiency of the x = 0.30 cell decreasing by only 1 and 3%, respectively. Using scanning electron microscopy and scanning transmission electron microscopy to investigate the CuxZn1-xS/CdTe interface, we demonstrate that the CuxZn1-xS layer segregates into a bilayer of Cu-Te-S and Zn-Cd-S, and thermodynamic reaction calculations support these findings. Despite its bilayer formation, the back contact still functions well. This investigation explains some of the physical mechanisms governing the device stack, inspires future work to understand interfacial chemistry and charge transfer, and elicits optimization to achieve higher-efficiency CdTe cells.","American Chemical Society (ACS)","","National Renewable Energy Lab.

"Influence of Tabula Rasa on Process- and Light-Induced Degradation of Solar Cells Fabricated From Czochralski Silicon","Meyer, Abigail R.; LaSalvia, Vincenzo; Nemeth, William; Xu, Wanxing; Page, Matthew; Young, David L.; Agarwal, Sumit; Stradins, Paul","14 SOLAR ENERGY; degradation; oxygen precipitation; silicon solar cell; Tabula Rasa; photovoltaic","Monocrystalline Si solar cells are fabricated from Czochralski (Cz) Si, which contains 10<sup>17</sup>–10<sup>18</sup> cm<sup>-3</sup> oxygen atoms. Cz Si undergoes degradation during high-temperature thermal processing steps, such as dopant diffusion to form the p - n junction. This degradation in the bulk minority carrier lifetime can be related to the formation of oxygen precipitates. We found that a high-temperature annealing process known as tabula rasa (TR) not only mitigates process-induced degradation via oxygen precipitate nuclei dissolution, but also modifies subsequent light-induced degradation. We report on the bulk carrier lifetime of n - and p -type Cz Si after TR, which homogenizes the interstitial oxygen in the bulk Si to its monoatomic form in either an N 2 or O 2 environment. A control sample, which was not subjected to a TR processing step, experienced severe process-induced degradation during a boron emitter thermal budget as oxygen precipitates were formed in the Si bulk. These precipitates could be imaged using photoluminescence. Additionally, samples that underwent a TR processing step prior to the boron emitter thermal budget show efficient gettering of metallic impurities compared to the control sample, which showed a decline in the implied open-circuit voltage after the gettering step. Furthermore, modification of the interstitial oxygen bonding by TR had a strong effect on the light-induced degradation kinetics. Instead of a typically observed monotonic decrease, minority carrier lifetime increases first, followed by a nonmonotonic decrease over a ~20 h period. Finally, we conclude that by modifying the interstitial oxygen bonding via TR pretreatment, p -type Cz Si wafers become substantially resistant to harsh solar cell processes and strongly modified light-induced degradation, which would open alternative ways to mitigate this degradation mechanism.","IEEE","","National Renewable Energy Lab.

We have previously reported that doping of triarylamine-based hole-transport layers (HTLs) with a triarylamine-based radical cation salt (EHCz-3EtCz/EH44-ox) leads to enhanced PSC stability at elevated temperatures. While it was shown the radical cation dopant did not need to be identical to the HTL matrix, little was known about dopant exchange to realize the maximum impact on device-level properties (e.g., increase in low intrinsic conductivity, mobility, hydrophobic properties, ease of synthesis, and thermal stability). In this paper, we study the impact of dopant exchange among stable, low-cost, high-glass-transition temperature (Tg), and easily synthesized triarylamine-based HTL and radical triarylamine cation salts as dopants. Using EH44-ox as dopant leads to the improved device-level power conversion efficiency (PCE) for all HTL matrices assessed. Moreover, increasing the number of ethylhexyl chains from one to two per molecule and positioning these chains at the periphery rather than the core resulted in improved hydrophobicity.

"Selection of optimal wavelengths for optical soiling modelling and detection in photovoltaic modules","Micheli, Leonardo; Fernández, Eduardo F.; Muller, Matthew; Smestad, Greg P.; Almonacid, Florencia","14 SOLAR ENERGY; dust; optical modelling; photovoltaic reliability; soiling; spectral losses","Soiling impacts the photovoltaic (PV) module performance by decreasing the amount of light reaching the photovoltaic cells and by changing their external spectral response. Currently, the soiling monitoring market is moving toward optical sensors that measure transmittance or reflectance, rather than directly measuring the impact of soiling on the performance of photovoltaic modules. These sensors, which use a single optical measurement, are not able to correct the soiling losses that depend on the solar irradiance spectra and on the spectral response of the monitored PV material. This work investigates methods that can improve the optical detection of soiling by extracting the full soiling spectrum profiles using only two or three monochromatic measurements. Spectral transmittance data, measured with a spectrophotometer and collected during a 46-week experimental soiling study carried out in Jaén, Spain, was analysed in this work. The use of a spectral profile for the hemispherical transmittance of soiled PV glass is found to significantly improve the soiling detection, returning the lowest errors independently of the PV materials and irradiance conditions. In addition, this work shows that it is also possible to select the measurement wavelengths to minimize the soiling loss detection error depending on the monitored PV semiconductor material (silicon, CdTe, a-Si, CIGS and a representative perovskite). The approaches discussed in this work are also found to be more robust to potential measurement errors compared to single wavelength measurement techniques.","Elsevier","","National Renewable Energy Lab.

Both the open-circuit voltage and PL-I are measured as functions of temperature and illumination intensity. With these two measurements, a full model-based fitting of the temperature and illumination dependence allows extraction of the effects of window layer band offset and shunt resistance, in addition to bulk and interface recombination parameters.

Laminates were produced by using solar glass and a suitable EVA encapsulant combined with 10 different back-sheets. The simultaneous usage of different optical filters allowed to investigate roughly the spectral sensitivity and the intensity impact.

Due to its higher band gap than traditional CdS, MZO can reduce parasitic absorption to significantly increase short-circuit current density while also providing a benefit of conduction band offset tuning through Mg:Zn ratio optimization. MZO has been successfully implemented into CdTe devices, however its stability has been of concern. The MZO stability issue has been attributed to the presence of oxygen in the CdTe device processing ambient, leading to double-diode behavior (S-kink) in the current density-voltage curves. Here we report on MZO thin films deposited by reactive co-sputtering. The reactively co-sputtered MZO thin films have encouraging stability, show no significant variation in work function of the surface over a period of 6 months, as measured by Kelvin probe. Energy conversion efficiencies of around 16% have been achieved both with and without presence of oxygen in device processing ambients across multiple research facilities. Finally, these efficiencies should be possible to increase further by tuning of the thin film deposition and device processing parameters, especially through optimization of the back contact.","Elsevier","","Colorado State Univ., Fort Collins, CO (United States); National Renewable Energy Lab.

While many different configurations of 3TT devices have been proposed, there is no standard taxonomy to discuss the device structure or loading topology. This Perspective proposes a taxonomy for 3TT solar cells to enable a common nomenclature for discussing these devices and their performance.

However, the long, bulky organic cations often form a barrier, hindering charge transport. In this study, for the first time, 2D-PPA engineering based on wide-bandgap (~1.68?eV) perovskites are reported. Pentafluorophenethylammonium (F5PEA+) is introduced to partially replace phenylethylammonium (PEA+) as the 2D-PPA, forming a strong noncovalent interaction between the two bulky cations. The charge transport across and within the planes of pure 2D perovskites, based on mixed ammoniums, increases by a factor of five and three compared with that of mono-cation 2D perovskites, respectively. The perovskite films based on mixed-ammonium (F5PEA+-PEA+) 2D-PPA exhibit similar surface morphology and crystal structure, but longer carrier lifetime, lower exciton binding energy, less trap density and higher conductivity, in comparison with those using mono-cation (PEA+) 2D-PPA. The performance of PSCs based on mixed-cation 2D-PPA is enhanced from 19.58% to 21.10% along with improved stability, which is the highest performance for reported wide-bandgap PSCs.","Wiley","","National Renewable Energy Lab.

"Linear viscoelastic characterization of electrically conductive adhesives used as interconnect in photovoltaic modules","Springer, Martin; Bosco, Nick","14 SOLAR ENERGY; 36 MATERIALS SCIENCE; electrically conductive adhesives; finite element method; material models; photovoltaic; viscoelasticity","Electrically conductive adhesives (ECAs) are incorporated into recent designs of photovoltaic (PV) modules and replace the traditional metallic solders as interconnects. This transition depicts a significant material change, and a proper understanding of the interconnects' mechanical response has not yet been established. However, such an understanding is necessary to (a) identify the driving forces for module degradation and failure, (b) allow for module design optimization, and (c) enable accurate lifetime predictions. This study summarizes the framework for the mechanical materials characterization and modeling of ECAs for PV applications. Only high-fidelity material models are able to capture the rate and temperature dependency of the ECA interconnect and allow for accurate modeling of the materials response. Furthermore, a linear viscoelastic representation is found to describe the mechanical response of the ECAs sufficiently well. The effects of curing conditions and environmental exposure are investigated, and material models for a variety of ECAs are reported and prepared for the use in numerical simulations. Overall, a finite element simulation of a generic submodel of a shingled cell module is used to highlight the need for high-fidelity material models and demonstrates the error made in the predicted stress states by using less sophisticated models.","Wiley","","National Renewable Energy Lab.

Further improvements of Fe-N-C catalysts would benefit from model thin film studies of activity and stability of catalytic sites, but synthesis of Fe-N-C model thin films is challenging. Here we report on synthesis and characterization of Fe-N-C thin films produced by co-sputtering iron and carbon in a reactive nitrogen atmosphere onto removable glassy carbon rotating disk electrode (RDE) tips. Scanning electron microscopy (SEM) measurements indicate that the Fe-N-C films deposited at high temperature are smoother than the films annealed at high temperature. Electrocatalytic activity measured on the thin Fe-N-C films is greater for both high-temperature samples than for the room-temperature sample. From the analysis of X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) data, exposure of the films to high temperatures results in increased graphitization of the carbon with the Fe-N-C films, and increased relative amount of graphitic and hydrogenated nitrogen species.

"PV Field Reliability Status--Analysis of 100,000 Solar Systems","Jordan, Dirk; Marion, William; Deline, Christopher; Barnes, Teresa; Bolinger, Mark","14 SOLAR ENERGY; field failure; field performance; photovoltaics; reliability","In this paper, we analyzed annual production data from 100 000 photovoltaic systems as well as comments relating to their performance and maintenance. Our analysis revealed that 80% to 90% of all systems performed within 10% of the predicted production or better. Also, 56% of the systems were still performing above P50 or the median at 5 years. However, a small but significant tail of about 7000 systems perform below P90 expectations. In general, residential systems have a lower rate of failure than utility or commercial systems. Despite higher rates of component failures, utility systems lose less power than residential or commercial systems. This outcome is likely due to closer monitoring and better operations and maintenance practices. Inverters are still the components that reportedly fail most often (4%-6%), but other failures such as unspecified repair and meters cause more production loss. Reported module failures are relatively rare (0.2%) and are within the range of historical values. Installation quality affects performance and safety as indicated by data showing connector, wiring, breaker, and fuse failures due to undersizing, electrical design, and improper connection. Lastly, early detection of degradation and proactive response resulted in less impact on production than reactive, unplanned repairs.","Wiley","","National Renewable Energy Lab.

"Estimating and parameterizing mismatch power loss in bifacial photovoltaic systems","Deline, Chris; Ayala Pelaez, Silvana; MacAlpine, Sara; Olalla, Carlos","14 SOLAR ENERGY; 42 ENGINEERING; bifacial photovoltaics; PV systems; mismatch; shading","Nonuniform irradiance on the rear side of bifacial photovoltaic (PV) systems can cause additional mismatch loss, which may not be appropriately captured in PV energy production estimates and software. We evaluated several scenarios including horizontal single-axis tracking (HSAT) over natural ground-cover and rooftop-mounted systems over high albedo reflective roofs. We found mismatch losses of up to 1.5% annual loss for very close-mounted (0.15 m) rooftop systems, but losses for HSAT systems and high-ground-clearance rooftop systems were lower (<0.5%). A simplified empirical relationship was found that links the spatial variation of irradiance (specifically, the mean absolute difference of irradiance) to the resulting mismatch loss factor, with an R<sup>2</sup> better than .99. Furthermore, this approximate relationship was experimentally validated on mismatched PV modules, and it provides a basis for rapidly estimating bifacial mismatch loss factors for use in hourly PV performance simulations such as PVSyst or SAM. Additional parameters investigated include (a) climate dependence and module orientation, which were not found to have a strong impact on bifacial mismatch losses and (b) PV module fill factor and bifaciality ratio, which did have a strong linear impact on mismatch losses.","Wiley","","National Renewable Energy Lab.

The possible advantages of endothermic singlet fission (enhanced use of photon energy and larger triplet energies for coupling with common absorbers) motivated us to assess the role of exciton delocalization in the activation of this process. Here we report the synthesis of a series of linear perylene oligomers that undergo endothermic singlet fission and have endothermicities in the range 5-10 kBT at room temperature in solution. We study these compounds using transient spectroscopy and modelling to unravel the singlet and triplet dynamics. We show that the minimal number of coupled chromophores needed to undergo endothermic singlet fission is three, which provides sufficient statistical space for triplet excitons to separate and avoid annihilation - and a subsequent fast return to the singlet state. Our data additionally suggest that torsional motion of chromophores about the molecular axis following triplet-pair separation contributes to the increase in entropy, thus lengthening the triplet lifetime in longer oligomers.","Nature Publishing Group","","National Renewable Energy Lab.

This bias has led to tremendous uncertainty in estimating the electricity generation by solar energy conversion systems. To effectively reduce the bias, this study proposes a physical solution of all-sky DNI that computes solar radiation in the infinite-narrow beam along the sun direction and the scattered radiation falls within the circumsolar region. In sharp contrast with the other DNI models, this method uses a finite-surface integration algorithm that computes solar radiation in differential solid angles and efficiently infers its contribution to a surface perpendicular to the sun direction. The new model substantially reduces the uncertainty in DNI by a factor of 2-7.","Elsevier","","National Renewable Energy Lab.

"A Review and Perspective on Cathodoluminescence Analysis of Halide Perovskites","Guthrey, Harvey L.; Moseley, John","14 SOLAR ENERGY; 36 MATERIALS SCIENCE; cathodoluminescence; electron beam generation; halide perovskites; recombination; solar cells","Halide perovskite solar cells have achieved a certified efficiency of 25.2%, surpassing CdTe and CuInGaSe<sub>2</sub>, which have long been regarded as the most-efficient thin-film photovoltaic materials. As this exciting class of materials continues to mature, researchers will require characterization techniques capable of exposing the interplay among structure, chemistry, and optoelectronic properties to inform processing strategies and increase both device efficiencies and long-term stability. Cathodoluminescence microscopy is an ideal technique to provide such information due to the high spatial resolution and robust optical information acquired. Here, the current body of work related to cathodoluminescence analysis of halide perovskite materials for optoelectronic applications is surveyed. This review demonstrates how cathodoluminescence can monitor degradation due to environmental stressors, phase segregation resulting from material processing, and other halide perovskite-centric material issues. A persistent concern associated with e-beam-based analysis of halide perovskites is what effect the electron beam has on the material properties being probed. Addressing this, a detailed discussion is provided on the origin of the cathodoluminescence signal and a review of studies focused on revealing changes in the properties of halide perovskites resulting from e-beam excitation. Finally, a perspective on future opportunities to expand the role of cathodoluminescence analysis for halide perovskites is provided.","Wiley","","National Renewable Energy Lab.

We find that onset potentials shift negatively as a function of increasing oxide thickness, but this effect is not reflected in the flatband potentials. This reveals the mechanism of these shifts is kinetic rather than thermodynamic,and suggests that hole leakage through the TiO<sub>2</sub> is responsible. When Pt nanoparticles are deposited onto the TiO<sub>2</sub>, positive shifts in both the onset and flatband potentials are observed, revealing Pt catalysts are beneficial for more than just increased catalytic rates.

Valuing and compensating CSP's dispatchability and flexibility requires electricity market structures and policies that appropriately remunerate generation during high-value portions of the day. In this paper, we review previous analyses of CSP economics and deployment, and we find that continued CSP growth will require valuation mechanisms that appropriately compensate for CSP's flexibility during both plant design and plant operation. We then review market structures that drive CSP operations and dispatch in jurisdictions where CSP is being developed, with perspectives from Spain, Chile, Australia, Morocco, South Africa, the United States, China, and the United Arab Emirates (Dubai). Despite broad agreement that CSP's dispatchability provides value to electricity grids, countries' policies for remunerating and leveraging such dispatchability varies widely. As deployment of CSP and variable renewable energy grows, it will be increasingly important to redesign current integration policies to signal the delivery of CSP's grid services more appropriately.","Elsevier","","National Renewable Energy Lab.

Moreover, the development of moisture-stable and heat-stable materials has increased the stability of PSCs. Small-area devices (<1 cm2) are typically fabricated using a spin-coating method; however, this approach may not be suitable for the preparation of the large-area (>100 cm2) substrates required for commercialization. Thus, materials and methods need to be developed for coating large-area PSCs.

In this work, 311 cesium chloride double perovskites (Cs<sub>2</sub>BB'Cl<sub>6</sub>) were selected from a set of 903 compounds as likely being stable on the basis of a statistically learned tolerance factor (t) for perovskite stability. First-principles calculations on these 311 double perovskites were then performed to assess their stability and identify candidates with band gaps appropriate for optoelectronic applications. We predict that 261 of the 311 Cs<sub>2</sub>BB'Cl<sub>6</sub> compounds are likely synthesizable on the basis of a thermodynamic analysis of their decomposition to competing compounds (decomposition enthalpy <0.05 eV/atom). Of these 261 likely synthesizable compounds, 47 contain no toxic elements and have direct or nearly direct (within 100 meV) band gaps between 1 and 3 eV, as computed with hybrid density functional theory (HSE06). Within this set, we identify the triple-alkali perovskites Cs<sub>2</sub>[Alk]<sup>+</sup>[TM]<sup>3+</sup>Cl<sub>6</sub>, where Alk is a group 1 alkali cation and TM is a transition-metal cation, as a class of Cs<sub>2</sub>BB'Cl<sub>6</sub> double perovskites with remarkable optical properties, including large and tunable exciton binding energies as computed by the GW-Bethe-Salpeter equation (GW-BSE) method. We attribute the unusual electronic structure of these compounds to the mixing of the Alk-Cl and TM-Cl sublattices, leading to materials with small band gaps, large exciton binding energies, and absorption spectra that are strongly influenced by the identity of the transition metal. The role of the double-perovskite structure in enabling these unique properties is probed through an analysis of the electronic structures and chemical bonding of these compounds in comparison with other transition-metal and alkali transition-metal halides.","American Chemical Society (ACS)","","National Renewable Energy Lab.

Substantial improvements have been made to device stability but potential issues with lead toxicity and leaching from devices remain relatively unexplored. The potential for lead leakage could be perceived as an environmental and public health risk when using perovskite solar cells in building-integrated photovoltaics. Here we present a chemical approach for on-device sequestration of more than 96 per cent of lead leakage caused by severe device damage. A coating of lead-absorbing material is applied to the front and back sides of the device stack. On the glass side of the front transparent conducting electrode, we use a transparent lead-absorbing molecular film containing phosphonic acid groups that bind strongly to lead. On the back (metal) electrode side, we place a polymer film blended with lead-chelating agents between the metal electrode and a standard photovoltaic packing film.

To address this problem, in this work we investigated the effects of various environmental variables on the degradation and failure behaviors of the polyamide-based backsheet in PV modules retrieved from five different locations, encompassing a variety of climates, including humid subtropical, hot-summer Mediterranean, tropical savanna climate and hot arid. The correlations between the degradation indicators and the weathering variables were further demonstrated by principle components analysis (PCA). We found strong relationships between: carbonyl formation and reflected solar radiation; hydroxyl formation and module temperature; yellowness and NO2 concentration, while no simple correlation could be found between a specific weathering factor and cracking. By introducing additional stress factors to the aged polyamide-based backsheet films with the novel 'fragmentation test', we successfully reproduced the field cracking behaviour. This study has demonstrated that different degradation modes of PV components respond differently to the environmental stresses encountered in service. Thereby, any accelerated laboratory test based on a single set condition or lacking key environmental variables would be inadequate to assess the long-term performance of PV modules and components. A new reliability-based methodology is proposed to quantitatively link laboratory testing with field results for the service life prediction of PV materials.","Elsevier","","National Renewable Energy Lab.

Optical errors of heliostats can cause drastic losses in the efficiency of power-tower plants. Accurately measuring optical errors is crucial to assessing and improving plant performance. This analysis discusses an innovate non-intrusive optical (NIO) approach to measure slope, canting, and tracking errors by detecting distortions in the reflected tower structure in heliostat images. Further in this work a sensitivity study is carefully conducted to determine the uncertainty requirements to allow the method to calculate slope errors with an accuracy of 0.25 mrad. Measurement uncertainty sources include camera resolution and position uncertainty, tower position uncertainty, and number of collected images. Each uncertainty source is investigated to determine its impact on the accuracy of the slope-error calculation. A combination of theoretical results and experimental results obtained from data collected on a heliostat at Sandia National Laboratories is used to determine and validate uncertainty requirements. The analysis shows that a measurement uncertainty of 0.25 mrad can be realized by realistically controlling uncertainty sources when implementing the NIO method. It demonstrates the superior performance of NIO in performing in-situ optical characterization.","Elsevier","","National Renewable Energy Lab.

In contrast, rapid deposition on inexpensive substrates or nanocrystalline films yields low costs, but comparatively inferior crystallinity, carrier transport, and recombination. Here, we present methods to deposit single-crystal material at rates 2-3 orders of magnitude faster than state-of-the-art epitaxy with low-cost methods without compromising crystalline or electro-optical quality. For example, single-crystal CdTe and CdZnTe films that would take several days to grow by molecular-beam epitaxy are deposited in 8 minutes by close-spaced sublimation, yet retain the same crystalline quality measured by X-ray diffraction rocking curves. The fast deposition is coupled with effective n- and p-type in-situ doping by In, P, and As. The epitaxy can be extended to nanocrystalline substrates. For example, we recrystallize thin CdTe films on glass to deposit large grains with low defect density. The results provide new research paths for photovoltaics, detectors, infrared imaging, flexible electronics, and other applications.","Nature Publishing Group","","National Renewable Energy Lab.

An analytic model is used to describe the excitation density dependence of PL intensity and extract the internal PL efficiency and multiple pertinent recombination parameters. A PL imaging technique is used to obtain carrier diffusion length without using a PL quencher, thus, free of unintended influence beyond pure diffusion. Our results show that perovskite samples tend to exhibit lower Shockley-Read-Hall (SRH) recombination rate in both bulk and surface, thus higher PL efficiency than the inorganic counterparts, particularly under low excitation density, even with no or preliminary surface passivation. PL lineshape and diffusion analysis indicate that there is considerable structural disordering in the perovskite materials, and thus photo-generated carriers are not in global thermal equilibrium, which in turn suppresses the nonradiative recombination. This study suggests that relatively low point-defect density, less detrimental surface recombination, and moderate structural disordering contribute to the high PV efficiency in the perovskite. This comparative photovoltaics study provides more insights into the fundamental material science and the search for optimal device designs by learning from different technologies.","","","National Renewable Energy Lab.

In general, high-performance thin films are obtained by a method commonly called solvent engineering (or antisolvent quench) processing. The solvent engineering method removes excess solvent, but importantly leaves behind solvent that forms chemical adducts with the lead-halide precursor salts. These adduct-based precursor phases control nucleation and the growth of the polycrystalline domains. There has not yet been a comprehensive study comparing the various antisolvents used in different perovskite compositions containing cesium. In addition, there have been no reports of solvent engineering for high efficiency in all-inorganic perovskites such as CsPbI<sub>3</sub>. In this work, inorganic perovskite composition CsPbI<sub>3</sub> is specifically targeted and unique adducts formed between CsI and precursor solvents and antisolvents are found that have not been observed for other A-site cation salts. These CsI adducts control nucleation more so than the PbI<sub>2</sub>-dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO) adduct and demonstrate how the A-site plays a significant role in crystallization. The use of methyl acetate (MeOAc) in this solvent engineering approach dictates crystallization through the formation of a CsI-MeOAc adduct and results in solar cells with a power conversion efficiency of 14.4%.","Wiley","","National Renewable Energy Lab.

Typically, this type of characterization is performed in the dark using a current injection that equals short-circuit current measured at standard test conditions (STC). Restricting imaging to such a temperature range limits the information obtained about the module and cells. However, it is not trivial to develop a tool that would allow for EL imaging to be performed under a wider range of temperatures. Here we demonstrate an in situ EL imaging capability developed within an environmental chamber that allows for control of sample temperatures between –40 and 90 °C. Additionally, we demonstrate EL imaging of 4-cell mini-modules (MiMo) under front-side mechanical loading. A Raspberry Pi-connected camera with short-pass filter removed is used for EL imaging. The camera is low-cost with a small form-factor, appropriate for use in a harsh, enclosed environment. The camera is installed within a thermally isolating housing mounted within the environmental chamber. Three example cases are given for MiMos that exhibit various forms of degradation including solder fatigue and cell cracking. It is shown that by measuring at conditions above and below STC, different behaviors may be identified. In some cases, restricting characterization to STC may lead to a failure to detect damage existing in the sample.","IEEE","","National Renewable Energy Lab.

However, while it is relatively inexpensive and initially adheres well to module components, EVA discolors with age and - as interfacial adhesion degrades - becomes susceptible to delamination, ultimately resulting in reduced module efficiency and shortened service lifetimes. As potential replacements for EVA, ionomer thermoplastic materials cure faster, are more resistant to discoloration and potential induced degradation, and do not evolve corrosive acetic acid, making them compatible with new device materials such as perovskites. Since there is limited information on ionomer durability for PV module applications, a series of field and accelerated laboratory aging studies were conducted to assess ionomer interface stability in the presence of terrestrial environmental stressors. It is shown that adhesion to the glass and cell interfaces of PV modules is inferior to EVA, both before and after aging, rendering ionomers particularly susceptible to delamination after short timeframes. Potential solutions to improve ionomer adhesion are discussed.","Elsevier","","National Renewable Energy Lab.

Differing from static discharge typically associated with lightning strikes on modules, we found diode failure by the mechanism of thermal damage under continuous, long-term overstress in forward bias. Our conclusion is based on evidence of energy dissipated—the small to medium extent of melt-through on the Schottky diode face. The diode failure shows distortions or roughening of the Schottky diode metal-semiconductor interface with the die attach, and some failures are accompanied by die-attach solder melting. We propose that nonuniform irradiance on the modules caused diode shunting due to extended periods of heat dissipation in the modules, because modules in this string were placed in two different orientations. In contrast, a second parallel module string of the same module type on the same rooftop with a unique plane of array did not show any diode failures. The thermal damage failure of melt-through was caused by the long-term current generated by overstressing of diodes that may have had crystalline and impurity defects.","Wiley","","National Renewable Energy Lab.

"Understanding the Interplay of Transport-Morphology-Performance in PBDB-T Based Polymer Solar Cells","Zhang, Qilin; Yuan, Xin; Feng, Yifeng; Larson, Bryon W.; Su, Gregory M.; Maung, Yin Maung; Rujisamphan, Nopporn; Li, Youyong; Yuan, Jianyu; Ma, Wanli","14 SOLAR ENERGY; 75 CONDENSED MATTER PHYSICS, SUPERCONDUCTIVITY AND SUPERFLUIDITY; free carrier mobility; nonfullerene acceptor; polymer solar cells; stability; time-resolved microwave conductivity; TRMC","Polymer–polymer blends have been reported to exhibit exceptional thermal and ambient stability. However, power conversion efficiencies (PCEs) from devices using polymeric acceptors have been recorded to be significantly lower than those based on conjugated molecular acceptors. Herein, two organic nonfullerene bulk heterojunction (BHJ) blends ITIC:PBDB-T and N2200:PBDB-T, together with their fullerene counterpart, PCBM:PBDB-T, are adopted to understand the effect of electron acceptors on device performance. Free charge carrier properties using time-resolved microwave conductivity (TRMC) measurements are comprehensively investigated. The nonfullerene devices show an improved PCE of 10.06% and 6.65% in the ITIC- and N2200-based cells, respectively. In comparison, the PCBM:PBDB-T-based devices yield a PCE of 5.88%. The optimal N2200:PBDB-T produced the highest TRMC mobility, longest lifetime, and greatest free-carrier diffusion length. It is found that such phenomena can be associated with the unfavorable morphology of the all-polymer BHJ microstructure. In contrast, the solar cells using either the PCBM or ITIC acceptors display a more balanced donor and acceptor phase separation, leading to more efficient free-carrier separation and transport in the operating device. By sacrificing efficiency for superior stability, it is shown that the improved structure in all-polymer blend can deliver a more stable morphology under thermal stress.","Wiley","","National Renewable Energy Lab.

Previous search for low-bandgap (1.2 to 1.4 eV) halide perovskites has resulted in several candidates, but all are hybrid organic-inorganic compositions, raising potential concern regarding device stability. Here we show the promise of an inorganic low-bandgap (1.38 eV) CsPb0.6Sn0.4I3 perovskite stabilized via interface functionalization. Device efficiency up to 13.37% is demonstrated. The device shows high operational stability under one-sun-intensity illumination, with T80 and T70 lifetimes of 653 h and 1045 h, respectively (T80 and T70 represent efficiency decays to 80% and 70% of the initial value, respectively), and long-term shelf stability under nitrogen atmosphere. Controlled exposure of the device to ambient atmosphere during a long-term (1000 h) test does not degrade the efficiency.

Soiling consists of mineral dust, soot particles, aerosols, pollen, fungi and/or other contaminants that deposit on the surface of PV modules. Soiling absorbs, scatters, and reflects a fraction of the incoming sunlight, reducing the intensity that reaches the active part of the solar cell. Here, we report on the comparison of naturally accumulated soiling on coupons of PV glass soiled at seven locations worldwide. The spectral hemispherical transmittance was measured. It was found that natural soiling disproportionately impacts the blue and ultraviolet (UV) portions of the spectrum compared to the visible and infrared (IR). Also, the general shape of the transmittance spectra was similar at all the studied sites and could adequately be described by a modified form of the Angstrom turbidity equation. In addition, the distribution of particles sizes was found to follow the IEST-STD-CC 1246E cleanliness standard. The fractional coverage of the glass surface by particles could be determined directly or indirectly and, as expected, has a linear correlation with the transmittance. It thus becomes feasible to estimate the optical consequences of the soiling of PV modules from the particle size distribution and the cleanliness value.","Nature Publishing Group","","National Renewable Energy Lab.

It is now important to quantify the amount of solar energy curtailed as a result of the activation of inverter grid support functions (GSFs). This paper proposes a methodology for estimating customer impact of volt-watt on customer PV energy curtailment using smart meter voltage data. This method estimates maximum possible curtailment for a given volt-watt curve based on the customer smart meter voltage over the time period of interest. This study compares the proposed methodology with actual field measurements using irradiance and customer inverter data in Hawaii, as well as with results from a previous simulation-driven study on the impact of advanced inverter GSFs activation on PV energy curtailment. Results show that our proposed method for estimating lost PV production caused by volt-watt control aligns reasonably well with field measurements and computer simulation for hundreds of customers. The proposed method could be used to estimate customer energy curtailment, which can inform future compensation mechanisms for utilities leveraging customer-sited resources to mitigate high-voltage and defer or avoid future infrastructure upgrades.","","","National Renewable Energy Lab.

Here, we show that the lithium (Li) dopant from HTLs can significantly dope the perovskite absorber layer through diffusion. Kelvin probe force microscopy mapping shows that Li diffusion increases the surface potential of the perovskite film. The potential at grain boundaries showed more increase than in grain interiors, indicating inhomogeneous distribution of Li dopant in the perovskite layer, which was further confirmed by lateral elemental mapping using time-of-flight secondary ion mass spectrometry. For both p-i-n and n-i-p device structures, the diffusion and nonuniform distribution of Li<sup>+</sup> ions are shown to influence the carrier-transport properties of perovskites and device characteristics.

With increasing dimensionality, the broad-band emission quantum yield decreases drastically, from 23% in n = 1 to <1% for the n = 3 compound. Using density functional theory calculations and transient reflectance spectroscopy, the broad emission is identified as originating from self-trapped excitons. A dynamic picture of the formation process is also presented, for which ultrafast (<5 ps) hole-trapping at the Sn site is the first step, followed by electron localization from Coulombic interaction. These findings are particularly valuable for designing perovskite materials with intense room-temperature broad-band emission for solid-state lighting applications.","American Chemical Society (ACS)","","Energy Frontier Research Centers (EFRC) (United States).

One of the critical parameters to control the properties of sputtered silicon films is their deposition pressure. In this work, structural and optoelectronic characteristics of ex-situ boron-doped poly-Si/SiO<sub>x</sub> passivating contacts, formed from sputtered intrinsic amorphous silicon (a-Si) deposited at different pressures on top of SiO<sub>x</sub>/c-Si substrates and subjected to a high-temperature boron diffusion step, are investigated. The deposition rate and density of the as-deposited a-Si films increase with reducing pressure. Low-temperature photoluminescence spectra captured from the as-deposited samples at different pressures do not show typical emissions from hydrogenated a-Si. Meanwhile, their Fourier-transform infrared absorption spectra all show Si–H stretching modes, indicating that hydrogen had been initially incorporated into the chemical SiO<sub>x</sub> layers and eventually hydrogenated the a-Si/SiO<sub>x</sub> interfaces during the sputtering process. After the high-temperature boron-diffusion step, all hydrogen-related peaks disappear. Lower pressure films (1.5 and 2.5 mTorr) show more consistent improved performance after hydrogen treatments, compared to higher pressure films (4 and 5 mTorr).

The world population is increasing, the energy use per person is growing more rapidly, and the total electricity use per person is growing even more quickly than that. To handle this demand, energy production must be increased, and it is vital for renewable sources to be used. Currently three quarters of a terawatt of power generated from photovoltaics (PVs) has been installed. At a somewhat optimistic average power-conversion efficiency of 18%, the distributed surface area of high purity optoelectronic grade semiconductor photovoltaic panels pointed at the sun is substantially larger than the area of the whole state of Rhode Island or nearly double the land mass of Luxembourg. While photovoltaic production continues to ramp to immense proportions, perovskite semiconductors are poised to greatly complement existing technology. On the other end of the size spectrum, the study of semiconductor nanocrystals or quantum dots (QDs) has led to advanced structures and deeper understanding within halide perovskite semiconductors. In this article, we show how the development of nanoscale metal halide perovskite semiconductors have gained prominence surpassing all other QD materials in terms of efficiency, and are becoming a platform for further improving technology to solve big energy challenges.","Elsevier - Cell Press","","National Renewable Energy Lab.

The discoloration rate is influenced by several weathering factors, such as UV light, module temperature, and humidity, as well as the permeability of oxygen into the module. Here, a rate dependence model employing the modified Arrhenius equations to predict the degradation rate for encapsulant discoloration in different climates is presented. Two modeling approaches are introduced, which utilize the field and accelerated UV testing degradation data in conjunction with the field meteorological data to determine the acceleration factor for encapsulant browning. A novel method of accelerated UV stress testing at three simultaneous module temperatures in a single environmental chamber test run is implemented to estimate the activation energy for browning. The test was performed on three field-retrieved modules to capture the wear-out failure mechanism. The degradation in short-circuit current Isc rather than maximum power is used as a decisive parameter for the discoloration analysis. Furthermore, the developed model has been used to predict the Isc degradation rate for the Arizona field characterized by a hot and dry climate and is validated against the field-measured value. It has also been applied to other climate types, e.g., the cold and dry climate of New York.","IEEE","","National Renewable Energy Lab.

The purification is effective at reducing MgOH<sup>+</sup> by an order of magnitude—from around 5 wt% in non-treated salt to less than 0.5 wt% in post-purification salt. The corresponding decrease in the measured corrosion rate of Haynes 230 at 800 °C from >3200 μm per year to around 40 μm per year indicates that soluble MgOH<sup>+</sup> is indeed correlated to corrosion. The addition of elemental Mg serves as both a scavenger of impurities and corrosion potential control, which are considered the primary mechanisms for corrosion mitigation.","Royal Society of Chemistry","","National Renewable Energy Lab.

"Macroscopic Nonuniformities in Metal Grids Formed by Cracked Film Lithography Result in 19.3% Efficient Solar Cells","Muzzillo, Christopher P.; Reese, Matthew O.; Mansfield, Lorelle M.","14 SOLAR ENERGY; lithography; metal grid; photovoltaics; solar cell; transparent conductive","Cracked film lithography (CFL) is an emerging method for patterning transparent conductive metal grids. CFL can be vacuum- and Ag-free, and it forms more durable grids than nanowire approaches. In spite of CFL’s promising transmittance/grid sheet resistance/wire spacing tradeoffs, previous solar cell demonstrations have had relatively low performance. This work introduced macroscopic nonuniformities in the grids to improve the short-circuit current density/fill factor tradeoff in small area Cu(In,Ga)Se2 cells. Furthermore, the performance of optimized baseline grids was matched by CFL grids with microscopic openings and macroscopic patterns, culminating in a 19.3%-efficient cell. Simulations show that uniform CFL grids are enhanced by patterning because it leads to better balance among shadowing, grid resistance and transparent conductive oxide resistance losses. Thin-film module efficiency calculations were performed to highlight the performance gains that metal grids can enable by eliminating the transparent conductive oxide losses and widening monoliths. Adding the patterned CFL grids demonstrated in this work to CIGS modules is predicted to reach 0.7% higher efficiency (absolute) than screen-printed grids.","American Chemical Society (ACS)","","National Renewable Energy Lab.

"Probabilistic Solar Power Forecasting Using Bayesian Model Averaging","Doubleday, Katharine; Jascourt, Stephen; Kleiber, William; Hodge, Brian","14 SOLAR ENERGY; Bayesian model averaging; beta distribution; probabilistic forecasting; solar power clipping; solar power forecasting","There is rising interest in probabilistic forecasting to mitigate risks from solar power uncertainty, but the numerical weather prediction (NWP) ensembles readily available to system operators are often biased and underdispersed. We propose a Bayesian model averaging (BMA) post-processing method suitable for forecasting power from utility-scale photovoltaic (PV) plants at multiple time horizons up to at least the day-ahead timescale. BMA is a kernel dressing technique for NWP ensembles in which the forecast is a weighted sum of member-specific probability density functions. We tailor BMA for utility-scale PV forecasting by modeling power clipping at the AC inverter rating and advance the theory of BMA with a new beta kernel parameterization that accommodates theoretical constraints not previously addressed. BMA is demonstrated for a case study of 11 utility-scale PV plants in Texas, forecasting at hourly resolution for the complete year 2018. BMA's mixture-model approach mitigates underdispersion of the raw ensemble to significantly improve forecast calibration, while consistently outperforming an ensemble model output statistics (EMOS) parametric approach from the literature. At 4-hour lead time, the BMA post-processing achieves continuous ranked probability skill scores of 2--36% over the raw ensemble, with consistent performance at multiple lead times suitable for power system operations.","IEEE","","National Renewable Energy Lab.

Pronounced compositional variations and secondary phase segregations are indeed typical features of non-stoichiometric kesterite materials. Certainly kesterite-based thin film solar cells with an off-stoichiometric absorber layer composition, especially Cu-poor/Zn-rich, achieved the highest efficiencies, but deviations from the stoichiometric composition lead to the formation of intrinsic point defects (vacancies, anti-sites, and interstitials) in the kesterite-type material. In addition, a non-stoichiometric composition is usually associated with the formation of undesirable side-phase (secondary phases). Thus the correlation between off-stoichiometry and intrinsic point defects as well as the identification and quantification of secondary phases and compositional fluctuations in non-stoichiometric kesterite materials is of great importance for the understanding and rational design of solar cell devices. Here, this paper summarizes the latest achievements in the investigation of identification and quantification of intrinsic point defects, compositional fluctuations and secondary phases in non-stoichiometric kesterite-type materials.","IOP Publishing","","National Renewable Energy Lab.

Despite achieving remarkable power conversion efficiencies, perovskite solar cells have not yet achieved their full potential, with the interfaces between the perovskite and the charge-selective layers being where most recombination losses occur. In this study, a fluorinated ionic liquid (IL) is employed to modify the perovskite/SnO<sub>2</sub> interface. Using Kelvin probe and photoelectron spectroscopy measurements, it is shown that depositing the perovskite onto an IL-treated substrate results in the crystallization of a perovskite film which has a more n-type character, evidenced by a decrease of the work function and a shift of the Fermi level toward the conduction band. Photoluminescence spectroscopy and time-resolved microwave conductivity are used to investigate the optoelectronic properties of the perovskite grown on neat and IL-modified surfaces and it is found that the modified substrate yields a perovskite film which exhibits an order of magnitude lower trap density than the control.

A comparison of the high-efficiency epitaxial film and a traditional polycrystalline film with a similar global composition reveals significant differences in microstructure and uniformity of emission properties despite similar performance. The analysis of epitaxial films with a higher gallium concentration indicates that the emission characteristics and nature of extended defects in epitaxial CIGS films are strongly dependent on the gallium content.

Monolayers of chiral organic molecules demonstrate CISS but are limited in their efficiency and utility by the requirement of a monolayer to preserve the spin selectivity. We demonstrate CISS in a system that integrates an inorganic framework with a chiral organic sublattice inducing chirality to the hybrid system. Using magnetic conductive-probe atomic force microscopy, we find that oriented chiral 2D-layered Pb-iodide organic/inorganic hybrid perovskite systems exhibit CISS. Electron transport through the perovskite films depends on the magnetization of the probe tip and the handedness of the chiral molecule. The films achieve a highest spin-polarization transport of up to 86%. Magnetoresistance studies in modified spin-valve devices having only one ferromagnet electrode confirm the occurrence of spin-dependent charge transport through the organic/inorganic layers.","AAAS","","Energy Frontier Research Centers (EFRC) (United States).

Previously, an open-circuit voltage beyond the Shockley–Queisser limit was demonstrated in hot-carrier devices based on InAs–InP–InAs nanowire heterostructures. However, in these first experiments, the location of light absorption, and therefore the precise mechanism of hot-carrier extraction, was uncontrolled. In this study, we combine plasmonic nanoantennas with InAs–InP–InAs nanowire devices to enhance light absorption within a subwavelength region near an InP energy barrier that serves as an energy filter. From photon-energy- and irradiance-dependent photocurrent and photovoltage measurements, we find that photocurrent generation is dominated by internal photoemission of nonthermalized hot electrons when the photoexcited electron energy is above the barrier and by photothermionic emission when the energy is below the barrier. We estimate that an internal quantum efficiency up to 0.5–1.2% is achieved. Insights from this study provide guidelines to improve internal quantum efficiencies based on nanowire heterostructures.","American Chemical Society","","National Renewable Energy Lab.

The validation of this method is first demonstrated on a semi-insulator GaAs wafer, and then, three lead-halide perovskite polycrystalline films with different cation mixtures are studied. We find that the hole mobility is significantly higher (~10x) than that of the electron mobility in all of the perovskite thin films studied.

But nonradiative Shockley–Read–Hall (SRH) recombination limits the efficiency of CdTe solar cells. Partial mitigation of bulk and grain-boundary SRH recombination was achieved by alloying CdTe with Se, and CdSexTe1-x absorbers are used in high-efficiency solar cells. Recently, interface recombination was significantly reduced with alumina passivation, but other properties of Al2O3/CdSexTe1-x/Al2O3 heterostructures have not yet been investigated. Herein, further progress in understanding and developing polycrystalline heterostructures with x = 0.2 is reported. It is shown that external photoluminescence quantum yield is increased to 0.2%, quasi-Fermi-level splitting to 950 mV, minority carrier lifetimes to 750 ns, and mobility to 100 cm2 Vs-1. Such polycrystalline CdSexTe1-x electronic characteristics match or exceed CdTe single-crystal properties. The resulting charge-carrier diffusion length of ≈14 μm is several times greater than the absorber thickness in test structures and in typical CdTe solar cells. Herein, with passivation and absorbers, polycrystalline CdSeTe solar cell open-circuit voltage is increased from the current 76% of the Shockley–Queisser limit to 82%, or close to 1 V is reported.","Wiley","","National Renewable Energy Lab.

A simple FGA posttreatment produces a significant increase in the implied open circuit voltage (iV<sub>oc</sub>) and the effective minority-carrier lifetime (teff) of high-resistivity crystalline Si (c-Si) samples, whereas low-resistivity samples show a minimal change. Treatment by means of AlO<sub>x</sub>:H and/or SiN<sub>x</sub>:H followed by postdeposition FGA results in a universal increase in t<sub>eff</sub> and iV<sub>oc</sub> for all substrate resistivities (as high as 12.5 ms and 728 mV for 100 Ω cm and 5.4 ms and 727 mV for 2 Ω cm n-type c-Si substrates).

However, this hydrogen concentration is insufficient to neutralize both the nonradiative defects inside the poly-Si films and dangling bonds associated with the amorphous Si phase present in them. The hydrogen injected by the SiN<sub>x</sub>:H + FGA technique can passivate both the interfaces and the defects and dangling bonds within the poly-Si film. These results are confirmed by low-temperature photoluminescence spectroscopy, Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy, and dynamic secondary-ion mass spectrometry measurements.","Wiley","","National Renewable Energy Lab.

Evaporated layers contain up to three phases, two crystalline and one amorphous. Relative amounts of all three have been determined by a combination of X-ray diffraction and FT-IR reflectance spectroscopy. Initially, excited singlet state rapidly produces a high yield of a transient intermediate whose spectral properties are compatible with charge-transfer nature. This intermediate more slowly converts to a significant yield of triplet, which, however, does not exceed 100% and may well be produced by intersystem crossing rather than singlet fission. The yields were determined by transient absorption spectroscopy and corrected for effects of partial sample alignment by a simple generally applicable procedure. Formation of excimers was also observed. In order to obtain guidance for improving molecular packing by a minor structural modification, calculations by a simplified frontier orbital method were used to find all local maxima of singlet fission rate as a function of geometry of a molecular pair. The method was tested at 48 maxima by comparison with the ab initio Frenkel-Davydov exciton model.","American Institute of Physics (AIP)","","Brookhaven National Lab.

Furthermore, when tuned to the global spectrum, a variation of this structure achieves a 1-Sun global efficiency of 39.2%. Nearly optimal bandgaps for six junctions were fabricated using alloys of III–V semiconductors. To develop these junctions, it was necessary to minimize threading dislocations in lattice-mismatched III–V alloys, prevent phase segregation in metastable quaternary III–V alloys and understand dopant diffusion in complex structures.

The underlying physics of drying-induced cracks were well-predicted by an empirical correlation relating crack spacing to capillary pressure. CFL is primarily controlled by varying the crack template thickness, which establishes a three-way tradeoff between the areal density of cracks, crack width, and spacing between cracks, which in turn determine final grid transmittance, grid sheet resistance, and the semiconductor resistance for a given solar cell. Since CFL uses a lift-off process, an additional constraint is that the metal thickness must be less than 1/3 of the crack template thickness. Furthermore, the transmittance/grid sheet resistance/wire spacing tradeoffs measured in this work were used to calculate solar cell performance: CFL-patterned grids should outperform screen-printed grids for narrow cells (0.5–2 cm wide) and/or cells with high semiconductor sheet resistance (=100 O/sq), making CFL attractive for monolithically integrated thin-film photovoltaic modules.","American Chemical Society","","National Renewable Energy Lab.

With the efficiencies of many common single-junction solar cell materials leveling off near their theoretical efficiency limits, there is renewed interest in applying this approach. However, there is ongoing debate as to the best approach for interconnecting sub-cells in series, or whether it is preferable to operate them independently. Here in this paper, we provide the first experimental demonstration of a tandem cell architecture with three terminals: one on top of the tandem cell, and two beneath it, in interdigitated back contact configuration. The two cells are interconnected with a transparent conductive adhesive, which is compatible with rough surfaces and exhibits negligible series resistance. Combining GaInP and Si sub-cells in this manner allows us to achieve a GaInP/Si tandem cell with a two-terminal efficiency of 26.4 ± 1.0%. We then show that utilizing all three terminals results in an efficiency boost of 0.9 ± 0.2%, to an efficiency of 27.3 ± 1.0%, and discuss the operation of the cell and its two interacting circuits.","Royal Society of Chemistry","","National Renewable Energy Lab.

However, the present synthesis of PbS QDs cannot produce highly efficient infrared solar cells. Here in this paper, a general synthesis is developed for low-bandgap PbS QDs (0.65-1 eV) via cation exchange from ZnS nanorods (NRs). First, ZnS NRs are converted to superlattices with segregated PbS domains within each rod. Then, sulfur precursors are released via the dissolution of the ZnS NRs during the cation exchange, which promotes size focusing of PbS QDs. PbS QDs synthesized through this new method have the advantages of high monodispersity, ease-of-size control, in situ passivation of chloride, high stability, and a 'clean' surface. Infrared solar cells based on these PbS QDs with different bandgaps are fabricated, using conventional ligand exchange and device structure. All of the devices produced in this manner show excellent performance, showcasing the high quality of the PbS QDs. The highest performance of infrared solar cells is achieved using ≈0.95 eV PbS QDs, exhibiting an efficiency of 10.0% under AM 1.5 solar illumination, a perovskite-filtered efficiency of 4.2%, and a silicon-filtered efficiency of 1.1%.","Wiley","","National Renewable Energy Lab.

We show that load and operating reserve requirements can be met for all hours while considering key generator operational constraints. Storage plays an active role in maintaining the balance of supply and demand during sunset hours. Under the highest PV penetration scenario, hours with >90% PV penetration are relatively common, which require rapid transitions between predominately conventional synchronous generation and mostly inverter-based generation.

However, passivation of a textured surface to reduce carrier recombination is difficult. Here, we related the electrical properties of cells fabricated on a KOH-etched, random pyramidal textured Si surface to nanostructure of the passivated contact and the textured surface morphology. The effects of both microscopic pyramidal morphology and nanoscale surface roughness on passivated contacts consisting of a polycrystalline Si (poly-Si) deposited on top of an ultrathin, 1.5-2.2 nm, SiO<sub>x</sub> layer is investigated. Using atomic force microscopy we show a pyramid face, which is predominantly a Si(111) plane to be significantly rougher than a polished Si(111) surface. This roughness results in a nonuniform SiOx layer as determined by transmission electron microscopy (TEM) of a poly-Si/SiO<sub>x</sub> contact. Our device measurements also show an overall more resistive, and hence thicker SiO<sub>x</sub> layer over the pyramidal surface as compared to a polished Si(111) surface, which we relate to increased roughness. Using electron-beam-induced current measurements of poly-Si/SiO<sub>x</sub> contacts we further show that the SiO<sub>x</sub> layer near the pyramid valleys is preferentially more conducting, and hence likely thinner than over pyramid tips, edges and faces. Hence, both the microscopic pyramidal morphology and nanoscale roughness lead to nonuniform SiO<sub>x</sub> layer, thus leading to poor poly-Si/SiO<sub>x</sub> contact passivation. Finally, we report >21% efficient and =80% fill factor front/back poly-Si/SiO<sub>x</sub> solar cells on both single-side and double-side textured wafers without the use of transparent conductive oxide layers and show that the poorer contact passivation on a textured surface is limited to boron-doped poly-Si/SiO<sub>x</sub> contacts.","American Chemical Society (ACS)","","National Renewable Energy Lab.

Safety professionals and maintenance workers using NFPA 70E have utilized the Doan, Stokes & Oppenlander or Enrique models, meant to determine arc energies in DC power systems using the maximum power method. These methods may lead to an overestimate of energy available in PV systems during a fault. Since PV modules/arrays are non-linear, current limited DC devices, some of these calculation methods may not accurately predict fault energy. This paper will validate current arc energy models for PV systems by comparing experimental and calculated data. Additionally, this data will help modify the current NFPA 70E models related to smaller solar arrays. Understanding where the real safety threshold for DC arc flash in PV systems exists will help maintenance and safety professionals better prepare for a variety of work related activities. This paper will analyze real arc data taken for PV systems <1000VDC and <60amps and compare this to the calculated incident energy models, to include 70E. Thus, using these comparisons, it may be possible to reduce the safety hazard severity and thus relax the PPE requirements for installation and maintenance crews.","IEEE","","National Renewable Energy Lab.

Natural weathering was also performed at locations, including the following: Golden, Colorado; Miami, Florida; Phoenix, Arizona; QiongHai, China; Riyadh, Saudi Arabia; and Turpan, China. Specimens were constructed using a laminated glass/poly (ethylene-co-vinyl acetate)/glass geometry. The compressive shear test (CST) was used to quantify the mechanical strength of attachment, taken as a proxy for adhesion. The fractography of select specimens (including cross-sectional optical microscopy) was used to verify the failure mode (delamination or decohesion). Additional analysis of the local solar spectrum as well as the specimen temperature was performed to interpret the results of natural weathering. The goals of this study include to identify the most significant stressors, clarify where strong coupling may occur between stressors, and validate accelerated test results relative to natural weathering.

However, due to the nature of solution processing and rapid crystal growth of perovskite thin films, a variety of defects can form as a result of the precursor compositions and processing conditions. The use of additives can affect perovskite crystallization and film formation, defect passivation in the bulk and/or at the surface, as well as influence the interface tuning of structure and energetics. Here, recent progress in additive engineering during perovskite film formation is discussed according to the following common categories: Lewis acid (e.g., metal cations, fullerene derivatives), Lewis base based on the donor type (e.g., O-donor, S-donor, and N-donor), ammonium salts, low-dimensional perovskites, and ionic liquid. Various additive-assisted strategies for interface optimization are then summarized; additives include modifiers to improve electron- and hole-transport layers as well as those to modify perovskite surface properties. To conclude, an outlook is provided on research trends with respect to additive engineering in PSC development.","Wiley","","National Renewable Energy Lab.

The experimental solar-matched 1.3 eV optical absorption onset of the Mg<sub>3</sub>SbN antiperovskite agrees with the theoretical prediction (1.3 eV direct, 1.1 eV indirect), and with the measurements of room-temperature near-bandgap photoluminescence.

In this work, we discover that the charge collection efficiency in tin-based PSCs is limited by a short diffusion length of electrons. Adding 0.03 molar percent of cadmium ions into tin-perovskite precursors reduce the background free hole concentration and electron trap density, yielding a long electron diffusion length of 2.72 ± 0.15 um.

"Origin of the Tunable Carrier Selectivity of Atomic-Layer-Deposited TiOx Nanolayers in Crystalline Silicon Colar Cells","Matsui, Takuya; Bivour, Martin; Ndione, Paul F; Bonilla, Ruy S.; Hermle, Martin","14 SOLAR ENERGY; 36 MATERIALS SCIENCE; solar cells; carrier selective contacts; titanium oxide; atomic layer deposition","Titanium oxide (TiOx) nanolayers grown by atomic layer deposition are investigated with respect to their application as carrier selective contacts for crystalline silicon (c-Si) solar cells. Although TiOx is known to act as an electron contact, in this work the selectivity of TiOx layers is found to be widely tunable from electron to hole selective depending on deposition conditions, post-deposition treatments, and work function of the metal electrode used. Using TiOx and an intrinsic hydrogenated amorphous silicon buffer layer, solar cell test structure exhibiting open-circuit voltages (Voc) as high as 720 and 650 mV are shown for electron and hole selective contacts, respectively. Surface photovoltage and capacitance-voltage measurements reveal that carrier selectivity is correlated with the amount of c-Si band bending induced by TiOx, which are governed not only by the effective work function difference at the Si/TiOx interface, but also by the negative fixed charge present in the TiOx layer. This new finding is in contrast to the previous model for carrier transport where selectivity is determined only by the asymmetric band offsets at the Si/contact interface. It highlights the influence of induced band bending to produce carrier depletion/inversion conditions, and the importance of its selectivity effect in a c-Si absorber.","","","National Renewable Energy Lab.

In this study, we determine the maximum thermodynamic power conversion efficiencies (PCEs) of PEC water splitting two-bandgap tandem devices that produce multiple carriers per photon absorbed via Multiple Exciton Generation (MEG) or Singlet Fission (SF) and in the presence of solar concentration. Here, we employ a detailed balance thermodynamic analysis to determine the effects of top cell thickness, solar concentration, carrier multiplication, electrode overvoltage (VO), and water absorption on PEC power conversion efficiency for water splitting cells. We have found a maximum PEC power conversion efficiency of 62.9% in cells using two ideal tandem MEG absorbers with bandgaps of 0.3 and 1.2 eV at 1000-suns solar concentration and 0 overvoltage; the maximum PCE for two tandem SF absorbers under the same conditions is nearly the same at 59% with the same values for the absorption thresholds. A very interesting and important result was that, upon thinning the top cell, the range of viable bandgaps for both the top and bottom cells is extended by as much as 0.5-1 eV while still maintaining high maximum conversion efficiency (60-63%). The effects of imposing different solar concentrations from 1X to 1000X and having different tandem configurations of SF and MEG layers were also studied.","American Institute of Physics (AIP)","","National Renewable Energy Lab.

"Dispatch optimization of concentrating solar power with utility-scale photovoltaics","Hamilton, William T.; Husted, Mark A.; Newman, Alexandra M.; Braun, Robert J.; Wagner, Michael J.","14 SOLAR ENERGY; 47 OTHER INSTRUMENTATION; dispatch optimization; concentrating solar power; CSP; photovoltaics; lithium-ion battery; mixed-integer linear programming; MILP; CSP-PV hybrid systems; grid integration; system analysis","Concentrating solar power (CSP) tower technologies capture thermal radiation from the sun utilizing a field of solar-tracking heliostats. When paired with inexpensive thermal energy storage (TES), CSP technologies can dispatch electricity during peak-market-priced hours, day or night. The cost of utility-scale photovoltaic (PV) systems has dropped significantly in the last decade, resulting in inexpensive energy production during daylight hours. The hybridization of PV and CSP with TES systems has the potential to provide continuous and stable energy production at a lower cost than a PV or CSP system alone. Hybrid systems are gaining popularity in international markets as a means to increase renewable energy portfolios across the world. Typically, CSP-PV hybrid systems have been evaluated using either monthly averages of hourly PV production or scheduling algorithms that neglect the time-of-production value of electricity in the market. To more accurately evaluate a CSP-PV-battery hybrid design, we develop a profit-maximizing mixed-integer linear program ($\mathcal{H}$) that determines a dispatch schedule for the individual sub-systems with a sub-hourly time fidelity. We introduce the mathematical formulation of such a model and show that it is computationally expensive to solve. To improve model tractability and reduce solution times, we offer techniques that: (1) reduce the problem size, (2) tighten the linear programming relaxation of ($\mathcal{H}$) via reformulation and the introduction of cuts, and (3) implement an optimization-based heuristic (that can yield initial feasible solutions for (($\mathcal{H}$) and, at any rate, yields near-optimal solutions). Applying these solution techniques results in a 79% improvement in solve time, on average, for our 48-h instances of (($\mathcal{H}$); corresponding solution times for an annual model run decrease by as much as 93%, where such a run consists of solving 365 instances of (($\mathcal{H}$), retaining only the first 24 h' worth of the solution, and sliding the time window forward 24 h. We present annual system metrics for two locations and two markets that inform design practices for hybrid systems and lay the groundwork for a more exhaustive policy analysis. A comparison of alternative hybrid systems to the CSP-only system reflects that hybrid models can almost double capacity factors while resulting in a 30% improvement related to various economic metrics.","Springer","","National Renewable Energy Lab.

Yet, the nanoscale strain distribution in operational devices is not easily accessible using standard methods. X-ray nanodiffraction offers the unique possibility to evaluate the strain or lattice spacing at nanoscale resolution. Moreover, the combination of nanodiffraction with additional techniques in the framework of multimodal scanning X-ray microscopy enables the direct correlation of the strain with material and device parameters such as the elemental distribution or local performance. This method is applied for the investigation of the strain distribution in CdTe grains in fully operational photovoltaic solar cells. It is found that the lattice spacing in the (111) direction remains fairly constant in the grain cores but systematically decreases at the GBs. The lower strain at GBs is accompanied by an increase of the total tilt. These observations are both compatible with the inhomogeneous incorporation of smaller atoms into the lattice, and local stress induced by neighboring grains.","IEEE","","National Renewable Energy Lab.

"Molten chloride salts for next generation CSP plants: Electrolytical salt purification for reducing corrosive impurity level","Ding, Wenjin; Gomez-Vidal, Judith; Bonk, Alexander; Bauer, Thomas","14 SOLAR ENERGY; 47 OTHER INSTRUMENTATION; concentrated solar power (CSP); corrosion control; corrosive impurity; cyclic voltammetry (CV); electrolysis; potentiodynamic polarization (PDP)","In this study, electrolysis with a Mg anode is presented to purify the molten chloride salt (MgCl<sub>2</sub>/KCl/NaCl 60/20/20 mol.%) for reducing its corrosivity. Using a Mg anode, the production of toxic gases like Cl<sub>2</sub> on an inert anode (e.g., tungsten) can be avoided. Moreover, compared to an inert anode, a lower over-potential is required to remove the corrosive impurity MgOH<sup>+</sup> in the molten salt due to the high reactivity of Mg. In order to evaluate the effect of the salt purification, the cyclic voltammetry (CV) method developed in our previous work is used to in-situ measure the concentration of the corrosive MgOH<sup>+</sup> impurity in the molten salt. The CV measurements indicate that the corrosive impurity is efficiently removed by electrolysis. For decreasing the cathode inactivation due to produced MgO on the surface, a pulsed potential applied on the tungsten cathode during electrolysis shows to be promising. This electrochemical salt purification method has shown to be promising by efficiently controlling the corrosivity of the molten chloride salt. The potentiodynamic polarization (PDP) measurements on a commercial high-temperature alloy (Incoloy 800 H) immersed in the molten salt indicate that the corrosion rate of the alloy is significantly reduced due to the salt purification. It could also lead to a reduction of the cost of the conventional salt purification step, structural container materials, and piping in next generation concentrated solar power (Gen3 CSP) plants.","Elsevier","","National Renewable Energy Lab.

However, there are two main challenges for enabling high-efficiency tandems: (1) design of a recombination layer to efficiently combine two perovskite subcells while also preventing bottom cell damage during top cell processing and (2) achieving high open-circuit voltage of the wide-gap subcell. Herein, we overcome both of these challenges. First, we demonstrate a nucleation layer consisting of an ultra-thin polymer with nucleophilic hydroxyl and amine functional groups for nucleating a conformal, low-conductivity aluminum zinc oxide layer by atomic layer deposition (ALD). This method enables ALD-grown recombination layers that reduce shunting as well as solvent degradation from solution processing on top of existing perovskite active layers. Next, we demonstrate a band-gap tuning strategy based on A-site cations of mismatched size (dimethylammonium and cesium) to enable a 1.7 eV perovskite with high, stable voltages. By combining these advances, we fabricate two-terminal all-perovskite tandem solar cells with 23.1% power conversion efficiency on rigid substrates and 21.3% on flexible plastic substrates.","Elsevier - Cell Press","","National Renewable Energy Lab.

Yet, there is still ample headroom to improve. For decades, mainstream technology has combined fast CdTe deposition with a CdCl2 anneal and Cu doping. The resulting defect chemistry is strongly compensated and limits the useful hole density to ~10^14 cm-3, creating a ceiling for fill factor, photovoltage and efficiency. In addition, Cu easily changes energy states and diffuses spatially, creating a risk of instabilities that must be managed with care. Here, we demonstrate a significant shift by doping polycrystalline CdSexTe1-x and CdTe films with As while removing Cu entirely from the solar cell. The absorber majority-carrier density is increased by orders of magnitude to 10^16-10^17 cm-3 without compromising the lifetime, and is coupled with a high photocurrent greater than 30 mA cm-2.

Here, we revealed that the P-i-N structure can outperform the BHJ ones with a nearly 50% efficiency improvement, reaching a power conversion efficiency approaching 10%.

Considering the adjustable polymer molecular weight and solubility, the P-i-N device structure can be more beneficial for all-polymer systems.

With single junction efficiencies exceeding 15%, materials development must now target long-term stability. This work focuses on the photobleaching dynamics and degradation chemistries of a class of small molecule donors inspired by benzodithiophene terthiophene cores (BDT-3T) with rhodanine endcaps, which have demonstrated 9% efficiency in single junction devices and >11% in ternary cells. Density functional theory was used to design three additional molecules with similar synthetic pathways and opto-electronic properties by simply changing the electron accepting endcap to benzothiazoleacetonitrile, pyrazolone, or barbituric acid functional groups. This new class of semiconductors with equivalent redox properties enables systematic investigation into photobleaching dynamics under white light illumination in air. Degradation chemistries are assessed via unique spectroscopic signatures for the BDT-3T cores and the endcaps using photoelectron spectroscopies. We show that the pyrazolone undergoes significant degradation due to ring opening, resulting in complete bleaching of the chromophore. The barbituric and rhodanine endcap molecules have moderate stability, while the benzothiazoleacetonitrile group produces the most stable chromophore despite undergoing some oxidative degradation. Collectively, our results suggest the following: (i) degradation is not just dependent on redox properties; (ii) core group stability is not independent of the endcap choice; and (iii) future design of high efficiency materials must consider both photo and chemical stability of the molecule as a whole, not just individual donor or acceptor building blocks.","Royal Society of Chemistry","","National Renewable Energy Lab.

To realize this potential, development of latent heat storage with phase change materials (PCMs) is attractive because of its high energy density and low material cost. Research in this area has identified many promising materials, and has developed effective storage system designs that could be used to deploy PCMs. However, the field has lacked a rigorous methodology to select the optimal material for a particular CSP system. To address this need, here we present a holistic model that evaluates all important influences of PCM properties on the performance and cost of an entire CSP plant. We apply this model to over 100 of the most widely considered candidate materials, including both salts and metals. We quantify the relative value of each PCM property, and identify leading materials for application in CSP systems. This method and our results may aid future efforts to develop latent heat storage by providing a more informed view of how material selection impacts an entire CSP system.","","","National Renewable Energy Lab.

Among them, polycrystalline antimony chalcogenide films are also promising for photovoltaic applications because they are nontoxic, stable, flexible, and have a suitable bandgap. Considerable effort has already been devoted to improving the power conversion efficiency of antimony chalcogenide solar cells, but their efficiency still lingers below 10% due in part to scarce fundamental optoelectronic studies that help guide their development. Here, we use a combination of time-resolved terahertz and transient absorption spectroscopies to interrogate the optoelectronic behavior of antimony selenide thin films. By combining these two techniques we are able to monitor both free and trapped carrier dynamics and then evaluate their respective diffusion lengths. Our results indicate that trapped carriers remain mobile and can reach charge collecting interfaces prior to recombination, and therefore, both free and trapped carriers can contribute to the photocurrent of antimony selenide solar cells.","American Chemical Society","","National Renewable Energy Lab.

"Mitigating Measurement Artifacts in TOF-SIMS Analysis of Perovskite Solar Cells","Harvey, Steven P.; Zhang, Fei; Palmstrom, Axel; Luther, Joseph M.; Zhu, Kai; Berry, Joseph J.","14 SOLAR ENERGY; 36 MATERIALS SCIENCE; TOF-SIMS; PSC; HPSC; cation migration; interface; interface chemistry; passivating additive; degradation","Time-of-flight secondary ion mass spectrometry (TOF-SIMS) is one of the few techniques that can specifically distinguish between organic cations such as methylammonium and formamidinium. Distinguishing between these two species can lead to specific insight into the origins and evolution of compositional inhomogeneity and chemical gradients in halide perovskite solar cells, which appears to be a key to advancing the technology. TOF-SIMS can obtain chemical information from hybrid organic-inorganic perovskite solar cells (PSCs) in up to three dimensions, while not simply splitting the organic components into their molecular constituents (C, H, and N for both methylammonium and formamidinium), unlike other characterization methods. Here, we report on the apparently ubiquitous A-site organic cation gradient measured when doing TOF-SIMS depth-profiling of PSC films. Using thermomechanical methods to cleave perovskite samples at the buried glass/transparent conducting oxide interface enables depth profiling in a reverse direction from normal depth profiling (backside depth profiling). When comparing the backside depth profiles to the traditional front side profiled devices, an identical slight gradient in the A-site organic cation signal is observed in each case. This indicates that the apparent A-site cation gradient is a measurement artifact due to beam damage from the primary ion beam causing a continually decreasing ion yield for secondary ions of methylammonium and formamidinium. This is due to subsurface implantation and bond breaking from the 30 keV bismuth primary ion beam impact when profiling with too high of a data density. Here, we show that the beam-generated artifact associated with this damage can mostly be mitigated by altering the measurement conditions. We also report on a new method of depth profiling applied to PSC films that enables enhanced sensitivity to halide ions in positive measurement polarity, which can eliminate the need for a second measurement in negative polarity in most cases.","American Chemical Society (ACS)","","National Renewable Energy Lab.

The inclusion of 1.34 eV quantum wells in the depletion region of the bottom cell extends the absorption edge to 930 nm. With a corresponding increase in the thickness of the top cell for current matching, the light-limiting photocurrent increases by >8%.

The effects of preparation conditions, including the substrate temperature, processing time, and plasma power, are studied. Afterwards, we integrate the PANO SiO<sub>x</sub> into the polysilicon passivated contact and optimize the passivation and contact performances. Excellent surface passivation with the n-type poly-Si and PANO SiO<sub>x</sub> on the n-type c-Si wafer is achieved by 880 °C annealing, which shows competitive passivation quality to the one with NASO SiO<sub>x</sub>.

"Development of Lattice-Mismatched GaInAsP for Radiation Hardness","France, Ryan M.; Espinet-Gonzalez, Pilar; Haidet, Brian B.; Mukherjee, Kunal; Guthrey, Harvey L.; Atwater, Harry A.; Walker, Don","14 SOLAR ENERGY; 71 CLASSICAL AND QUANTUM MECHANICS, GENERAL PHYSICS; gallium arsenide; photovoltaic cells; radiation hardening; III-V semiconductor materials","We develop lattice-mismatched GaInAsP as an alternative alloy to pure As-based alloys currently used in III-V multijunction solar cells. Increasing the alloy phosphorous and indium content while maintaining an optimal bandgap may allow high efficiency multijunction devices with increased radiation hardness. Here, 1.0-eV GaInAsP is developed and implemented into single and multijunction solar cell devices. The lattice-mismatched GaInAsP must be grown strain free, and the subcell thickness must be maintained below the thickness where surface-driven phase separation occurs. As observed in transmission electron microscopy and cathodoluminescence imaging, phase separation strengthens in the GaInAsP layer and leads to interfacial defect formation when the cell thickness is too great. We show single junction 1.0-eV Ga 0.5 In 0.5 As 0.7 P 0.3 with excellent carrier collection and a bandgap-voltage offset of 0.40 V. This material quality approaches that of 1.0-eV Ga 0.7 In 0.3 As used in inverted metamorphic multijunction devices, but has increased phosphorus content and consequently is expected to have a higher radiation resistance. We incorporate the 1.0-eV GaInAsP subcell into a 3-junction inverted metamorphic solar cell to test the performance of the subcell in a multijunction. No additional loss is observed upon integration into a multijunction cell: both the carrier collection and voltage of the GaInAsP subcell are unchanged from single junction devices. While further materials development and radiation testing is still required, these preliminary results indicate that lattice-mismatched GaInAsP can be effectively used in multijunction solar cells to replace radiation-soft materials.","IEEE","","National Renewable Energy Lab.

M.","14 SOLAR ENERGY; 47 OTHER INSTRUMENTATION; soiling loss; electrostatic force; atomic force microscopy; adhesion force; attraction force; dust particles","Photovoltaic (PV) energy-yield loss due to solar module soiling has become increasingly important as solar module deployment is now at the hundreds of gigawatts scale and continues to grow rapidly. The electrostatic attraction and adhesion force (F<sub>es</sub>) of dust particles by the high voltages from solar panels have been reported to be 1 to 2 orders of magnitude stronger than the van der Waals and water capillary forces, which has been corroborated by observing the increase in system voltage-induced soiling rate by setting up an outdoor test. Here, we report another characteristic of F<sub>es</sub> on soiling - long-lasting or slow decay after turning off the high voltage applied to solar panels. The F<sub>es</sub> decay time varies across a wide time range of 1 to 10 h, depending on two factors: 1) whether the cell, the particle, or both were charged with high voltage before the voltages were turned off; and 2) how the cell was connected to the ground after the voltage was turned off - either connected through the power-supply electronics, directly connected to the ground, or electrically floated. The Fes decay is understood in terms of 1) net electrical charge dissipations in both particle and cell, 2) thermal disordering of dipole polarization in the module glass dielectrics, and 3) charge redistribution by the electrostatic interaction of particle and module glass. This long-lasting F<sub>es</sub> for hours can affect the solar panel soiling after sunset, and it can have an even greater effect when combined with water condensation at night.","Elsevier","","National Renewable Energy Lab.

In traditional approaches, the local GHI can be measured with very expensive instruments, and the large-area GHI collection depends on complex satellite-based models, solargis algorithms, and the high-performance computers (HPC). In this paper, a novel approach is proposed to capture the GHI conveniently and accurately. Considering the nonstationary property of the GHI on cloudy days, the GHI capturing is cast as an image regression problem. In traditional approaches, the image regression problem is treated as two parts, feature extraction (for the images) and regression model (for the regression targets), which are optimized separately and blocked the interconnections. Considering the nonlinear regression capability, a convolutional neural network (CNN) based image regression approach is proposed to provide an End-to-End solution for the cloudy day GHI capturing problem in this paper. The multilayer CNN is based on the AlexNet and VGG. The L2 (least square errors) with regularization is used as the loss function in the regression layer. For data cleaning, the Gaussian mixture model with Bayesian inference is employed to detect and eliminate the anomaly data in a nonparametric manner. The purified data are used as input data for the proposed image regression approach. In the experiments, three-month sky images and GHI data (with 1-min resolution) are provided by the National Renewable Energy Laboratory (NREL) with the HPC system. The numerical results demonstrate the feasibility and effectiveness of the proposed approach.","Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers","","National Renewable Energy Lab.

An understanding of failure modes within inverters requires evaluation of a dataset that captures insights from multiple characterization techniques (including field diagnostics, production data analysis, and current-voltage curves). One readily available dataset that can be leveraged to support such an evaluation are maintenance records, which are used to log all site-related technician activities, but vary in structuring of information. Using machine learning, this analysis evaluated a database of 55,000 maintenance records across 800+ sites to identify inverter-related records and consistently categorize them to gain insight into common failure modes within this critical asset. Communications, ground faults, heat management systems, and insulated gate bipolar transistors emerge as the most frequently discussed inverter subsystems. Further evaluation of these failure modes identified distinct variations in failure frequencies over time and across inverter types, with communication failures occurring more frequently in early years. Increased understanding of these failure patterns can inform ongoing PV system reliability activities, including simulation analyses, spare parts inventory management, cost estimates for operations and maintenance, and development of standards for inverter testing. Advanced implementations of machine learning techniques coupled with standardization of asset labels and descriptions can extend these insights into actionable information that can support development of algorithms for condition-based maintenance, which could further reduce failures and associated energy losses at PV sites.","Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers","","Sandia National Lab.

The results suggest that ZTNO is a heavily compensated semiconductor, with a high density of neutral defects dominating the electron scattering processes.

Furthermore, the electroluminescence spectrum shows emission peaks from both the emitter and base, leading to an open-circuit voltage that is not strictly dominated by either layer. The reverse heterojunction design is increasingly beneficial as the one-sun voltage increases.","IEEE","","National Renewable Energy Lab.

Unfortunately, this is a common occurrence in field-deployed modules due to the myriad of environmental factors that can result in partial shading. In this work, we identify as-grown nonuniformities in the Cu(In,Ga)Se<sub>2</sub> (CIGS) absorber layers as the points of origin for the damage induced under reverse-bias conditions. The structure and chemistry associated with inclusions and voids in the CIGS films cause these features to act as resistive heating elements in reverse-bias conditions. This localized resistive heating provides the energy required to induce thermal runaway breakdown in the CIGS devices, resulting in damage to charge collection and reduced active area of a device. This mechanism is also described with a robust device model to connect the experimental observations with their physical origins.","Wiley","","National Renewable Energy Lab.

In this perspective, we discuss recent advances in ultrafast spectroscopic probes to understand the dynamics at such interfaces. Transient reflectance (TR) enables monitoring of the surface carriers that are within ~10 nm of the surface or interface of interest. Crucial parameters such as surface recombination velocity and carrier diffusion can be determined. When a strong surface or interfacial field is present the reflectance spectrum will exhibit Franz-Kelydesh oscillations. Monitoring the transient formation or decay of such oscillations informs about the interfacial field and is referred to as transient photoreflectance (TPR). Such fields are helpful in designing systems in order to move carriers away from surfaces where photocorrosion can occur and towards catalytic surfaces. Finally, we discuss transient infrared attenuated total reflection (TATR) to probe the ultrafast reaction intermediates in a photo-driven chemical reaction.","","","National Renewable Energy Lab.

Thus, it is beneficial to understand the origin of large metastabilities in order to define what processing changes might diminish metastability without impacting other desirable aspects of high-performance devices. This report attempts to reproduce large metastabilities like those in some commercial products both through absorber and buffer processing variations in small devices. While variations of both types were found to affect metastability, only buffer variations could reproduce large metastability in high-efficiency devices. Device modeling validates that buffer effects alone are sufficient to explain the large metastability seen in these devices.","Wiley","","National Renewable Energy Lab.

In this work, an efficient surface passivation method for emerging CsPbI3 perovskite QDs using a variety of inorganic cesium salts (cesium acetate (CsAc), cesium idodide (CsI), cesium carbonate (Cs2CO3), and cesium nitrate (CsNO3)) is reported.

Graph-based neural network architectures have emerged in recent years as the most successful approach for predictions based on molecular structure and have consistently achieved the best performance on benchmark quantum chemical datasets. However, these models have typically required optimized 3D structural information for the molecule to achieve the highest accuracy. These 3D geometries are costly to compute for high levels of theory, limiting the applicability and practicality of machine learning methods in high-throughput screening applications. In this study, we present a new database of candidate molecules for organic photovoltaic applications, comprising approximately 91,000 unique chemical structures. Compared to existing datasets, this dataset contains substantially larger molecules (up to 200 atoms) as well as extrapolated properties for long polymer chains. We show that message-passing neural networks trained with and without 3D structural information for these molecules achieve similar accuracy, comparable to state-of-the-art methods on existing benchmark datasets. Furthermore, these results therefore emphasize that for larger molecules with practical applications, near-optimal prediction results can be obtained without using optimized 3D geometry as an input. We further show that learned molecular representations can be leveraged to reduce the training data required to transfer predictions to a new density functional theory functional.","American Institute of Physics (AIP)","","National Renewable Energy Lab.

This study uses single-walled carbon nanotubes (SWCNTs) as a high-mobility hole extraction layer at the interface with a perovskite absorber. When employed as a charge-transfer cascade-like structure with a low-mobility hole-selective contact, this configuration can suppress the interfacial recombination through the rapid removal of holes from the interface region. Reducing these recombination losses in turn results in very low voltage losses of less than 340 mV in n-i-p perovskite solar cells.","American Chemical Society (ACS)","","Energy Frontier Research Centers (EFRC) (United States).

Here, we report for the first time on fabricating 2D perovskites (<em>n</em>=5) with mixed cations of MA<sup>+</sup>, FA<sup>+</sup>, and cesium (Cs<sup>+</sup>).

The resulting perovskite also exhibits longer carrier lifetime and higher conductivity in triple-cation 2D perovskite solar cells (PSCs). Furthermore, the power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 2D PSCs with triple cations was enhanced by more than 80% (from 7.80% to 14.23%) compared to PSCs fabricated with a mono cation; the PCE is also higher than that of PSCs based on binary-cation (MA<sup>+</sup>-FA<sup>+</sup> or MA<sup>+</sup>-Cs<sup>+</sup>) 2D structures.","Wiley","","Energy Frontier Research Centers (EFRC) (United States).

Disconnection faults are manually introduced and correctly identified and localized applying the proposed technique. The SSTDR technique can detect and locate disconnects through at least eight 36-cell modules.

Different optical modelling tools implement these elements with various approaches. Discrepancies can easily accumulate in simulations of a large optical system as a result of incorrect implementations. This study reviews and verifies the implementations of these two factors in six tools that are widely used for optical modelling in solar energy research: Tonatiuh, SolTrace, Tracer, Solstice, Heliosim and SolarPILOT. The review incorporates three rounds of tests. Firstly, basic tests examine each factor carefully in simplified on-axis reflector-target configurations (round 'A'). Secondly, off-axis effects are introduced (round 'B'). Thirdly, full heliostat field simulations are verified (round 'C'). All of the test cases are simulated with each modelling tool, and results are compared. Discrepancies were observed due to approximations inherent in the cone optics (convolution) methods, incorrect implementation the of pillbox slope errors, different approaches to setting the circumsolar ratio for the Buie sunshape, and different approaches to the calculation of blocking and shading losses in some tools. All issues are discussed fully, and solutions to most issues were implemented within the scope of the present study. Some remaining issues are noted. The study highlights the importance of careful implementation of these aspects of optical modelling and contributes to an improvement in the quality of several widely-used tools.","Elsevier","","National Renewable Energy Lab.

CLSI reveals significant compositional fluctuation in these materials that correlates with the distribution of threading dislocations in the CGBs. Threading dislocations are observed to collect in regions between abrupt transitions in emission energy, implying that concomitant strain fluctuations in these regions restrict dislocation motion. Thus, the compositional fluctuation leads to elevated threading dislocation densities that degrade CGB quality. We also correlate compositional fluctuation in the CGB with compositional fluctuation in subsequently grown device layers. The effectiveness of specific growth conditions at suppressing compositional fluctuation and limiting threading dislocation density is evaluated. CGBs grown at high temperatures with high Al content exhibit the lowest defect densities. The use of a high V/III ratio suppresses compositional fluctuation and defect density.

The underlying correlation emerges from solar irradiance that is responsible in part for both the variability in solar PV power and temperature. The proposed model can be used to capture the uncertainty in solar PV power and its correlation with the electric power consumption of thermostatically controlled loads. First, a model for solar PV power that explicitly incorporates the stochasticity due to clouds via a regime-switching process between the three classes of sunny , overcast and partly cloudy is proposed. Then, the relationship between temperature and solar power is postulated using a second-order Volterra model. This joint modeling is leveraged to develop a joint probabilistic forecasting method for solar PV power and temperature. Real-world datasets that include solar PV power and temperature measurements in California are analyzed and the effectiveness of the joint model in providing probabilistic forecasts is verified. The proposed forecasting methodology outperforms several reference methods thus portraying that the underlying correlation between temperature and solar PV power is well defined and only requires a simple lower-complexity sampling space.","","","National Renewable Energy Lab.

The nanocrystalline silicon films were doped by either gaseous deposition precursors or post-deposition ion implantation, resulting in boron concentrations ranging from 1<sup>-2</sup> x 10<sup>20</sup> cm<sup>-3</sup> to 3 x 10<sup>21</sup> cm<sup>-3</sup>. Reasonable values of the Seebeck coefficient and electrical conductivity were obtained at 300 K, comparable to many other research work. We also report thermal conductivity measurements on these films before doping, which we use to estimate their prospective thermoelectric efficiency. These measurements show values as low as 0.76 W/mK at 300 K which depend highly upon the grain sizes of the nc-Si films. We find that post-deposition doping by ion-implantation is more effective at enhancing the power factor than gaseous doping, and the power factor is only weakly dependent upon doping concentration for the films doped by ion implantation. We conclude that improvements of the thermoelectric efficiency of <em>nc</em>-Si films may depend more on a reduction of their thermal conductivity than doping optimization. The small grain sizes and the low thermal conductivity of the undoped <em>nc</em>-Si films accomplished in this work are therefore encouraging developments.","Springer","","National Renewable Energy Lab.

Measured complex index of refraction data were used for the materials comprising the devices, and hourly irradiance data were extracted from Version 3 of the National Solar Radiation Database. Simulations were performed for Toledo OH, Golden CO, Phoenix AZ, and New Orleans LA, and the effect of local temperature variation was also considered. The combination of irradiance and temperature variations throughout the year cause different devices to be optimal at different times of the year. Interestingly, devices constructed to maximize AM1.5 photoconversion efficiency do not necessarily maximize the annual energy yield. A detailed analysis of the monthly energy yields at the different locations reveals the interplay between the changing light and temperature conditions. Over the course of the year these effects average to some degree so that annual energy yields that are close to the maximum possible value can be achieved by several different tandem device designs. The conclusions are valid for devices made with relatively thin perovskite layers, such as those used in champion efficiency devices. When the perovskite layers are thicker, however, the device is less tolerant to variation. Our results show that close matching of bandgap pairs is not essential for the fabrication of high-performance tandems. These findings should allow manufacturing efforts to proceed without the need for precise compositional control during formation of the absorber layers.","Royal Society of Chemistry","","National Renewable Energy Lab.

In contrast to oxides, there are no known nitride perovskites, likely due to the competition with oxidation, which makes the formation of pure nitride materials difficult and synthesis of oxynitride materials more common. While deposition of oxynitride perovskite thin films is important for many electronic applications, it is difficult to control oxygen and nitrogen stoichiometry. Lanthanum tungsten oxynitride (LaWN3-..delta..O..delta..) thin films with varying La:W ratio are synthesized by combinatorial sputtering and characterized for their chemical composition, crystal structure, and microstructure. A three-step synthesis method, which involves co-sputtering, capping layer deposition, and rapid thermal annealing, is established for producing crystalline thin films while minimizing the oxygen content. Elemental depth profiling results show that the cation-stoichiometric films contain approximately one oxygen for every five nitrogen (..delta.. = 0.5). Synchrotron-based diffraction indicates a tetragonal perovskite crystal structure. These results are discussed in terms of the perovskite tolerance factors, octahedral tilting, and bond valence. Overall, this synthesis and characterization is expected to pave the way toward future thin film property measurements of lanthanum tungsten oxynitrides and eventual synthesis of oxygen-free nitride perovskites.","Wiley","","Energy Frontier Research Centers (EFRC) (United States).

Poor intrinsic catalytic ability and surface corrosion in aqueous electrolyte remain key obstacles. Significant progress has been made developing thin-film protection layers and active catalysts for photoelectrochemical devices, but combining these into a catalytic protection layer that can provide long-term stability without sacrificing performance has proven difficult due, in large part, to challenges in developing active and stable interfaces. In this work, we demonstrate that a nanoscale molybdenum disulfide (MoS<sub>2</sub>) film functions both as an effective protection layer and excellent hydrogen evolution catalyst for GaInP<sub>2</sub> photocathodes, with only a ~10% loss in initial light-limited current density after 100 h, and a photocurrent onset potential better than that of the same state-of-the-art device with a platinum-ruthenium catalyst. Using transient photoreflectance spectroscopy, we probed the carrier dynamics of these photocathodes and show that the MoS<sub>2</sub> coated device exhibits improved electron transfer at the surface interface compared to the PtRu catalyzed device.

"No Evidence for Passivation Effects of Na and K at Grain Boundaries in Polycrystalline Cu(In,Ga)Se2 Thin Films for Solar Cells","Abou-Ras, Daniel; Nikolaeva, Aleksandra; Caicedo Davila, Sebastian; Krause, Maximilian; Guthrey, Harvey L; Al-Jassim, Mowafak M; Morawski, Marcin; Scheer, Roland","14 SOLAR ENERGY; 36 MATERIALS SCIENCE; Cu(In,Ga)Se2; grain boundaries; potassium; sodium; solar cells","Thin-film solar cells based on Cu(In,Ga)Se2 (CIGSe) absorber layers reach conversion efficiencies of above 20%. One key to this success is the incorporation of alkali metals, such as Na and K, into the surface and the volume of the CIGSe thin film. The present work discusses the impact of Na and K on the grain-boundary (GB) properties in CIGSe thin films, i.e., on the barriers for charge carriers, ..phi..b, and on the recombination velocities at the GBs, sGB. First, the physics connected with these two quantities as well as their impact on the device performance are revised, and then the values for the barrier heights and recombination velocities are provided from the literature. The sGB values are measured by means of a cathodoluminescence analysis of Na-/K-free CIGSe layers as well as on CIGSe layers on Mo/sapphire substrates, which are submitted to only NaF or only KF postdeposition treatments. Overall, passivating effects on GBs by neither Na nor K can be confirmed. The GB recombination velocities seem to remain on the same order of magnitude, in average about 10^3-10^4 cm s^-1, irrespective of whether CIGSe thin films are Na-/K-free or Na-/K-containing.","","","National Renewable Energy Lab.

"Investigation of temperature distribution on a new linear Fresnel receiver assembly under high solar flux","Parikh, Abhishek S.; Martinek, Janna G.; Mungas, Greg; Kramer, Nick; Braun, Robert; Zhu, Guangdong","14 SOLAR ENERGY; 47 OTHER INSTRUMENTATION; concentrating solar power; linear Fresnel; operating temperature; secondary reflector; solar flux; receiver assembly; heat-transfer anaylsis; SolTrace","A linear Fresnel collector design with an operation temperature of 300 degrees C or above typically requires a solar flux concentration ratio of at least 20 on the surfaces of the receiver assembly. For the commercial linear Fresnel collector design in this work, the receiver assembly includes a secondary reflector and an evacuated receiver tube. The high-concentration solar flux may impose additional operating-temperature requirements on the secondary reflector and receiver tube. Thus, a careful heat-transfer analysis is necessary to understand the operating temperature of the receiver assembly component surfaces under design and off-design conditions to guide appropriate material selections. In this work, a numerical heat-transfer analysis is performed to calculate the temperature distribution of the surfaces of the secondary reflector and receiver glass envelope for a commercial collector design. Operating conditions examined in the heat-transfer analysis include various wind speeds and solar concentration ratios. The results indicate a surface temperature higher than 100 degrees C on the secondary reflector surface, which suggests that a more advanced secondary reflector material is needed. The established heat-transfer model can be used for optimization of the other types of linear Fresnel collectors.","Wiley","","National Renewable Energy Lab.

For this purpose, two 'extreme' chalcopyrite absorber systems are studied: Cu(In,Ga)(S,Se)2 with industrial relevance (STION), and Cu(In,Ga)Se2 with 'research grade' properties (NREL). Samples were subjected to NaF-PDT and KF-PDT, and investigated using x-ray and ultra-violet photoelectron spectroscopy, Auger electron spectroscopy, as well as synchrotron-based soft x-ray emission spectroscopy. Considerably different alkali-induced effects are found for the two systems. In particular, we only detect a PDT-related Cu depletion on the NREL absorber surfaces (and only on those leading to high-efficiency devices). We also observe a reduction in the surface S/Se ratio for all alkali-treated STION absorbers, in addition to the presence of sulfates after the KF-PDT. After processing the PDT absorbers to fully operating cells, we find that the PDT temperature has a significant impact on the resulting device efficiencies - both the NREL and STION absorbers can result in high-efficiency and low-efficiency devices, depending on KF-PDT processing parameters. The absorbers of low-efficiency KF-PDT devices show the largest Cu surface content after PDT, causing the valence band maximum to be closer to the Fermi energy, thus possibly leading to less efficient charge-carrier separation and/or enhanced recombination at the interface. Finally, we find varying degrees of Na, K, and/or F residuals on the different absorber surfaces after PDT, indicating a potential 'hidden' parameter in employing PDTs for improved solar cell performance.","American Chemical Society (ACS)","","Lawrence Berkeley National Lab.

Using FA-MA-Cs-based perovskite, SSG devices showed improved efficiency from 17.76% (control) to 20.30% (SSG), with an unencapsulated device retaining >80% of its initial efficiency over 4,680-h storage in an ambient environment with high relative humidities. The SSG devices also exhibited much improved thermal and operational stabilities.

"Methodology to predict annual yield losses and gains caused by solar module design and materials under field exposure","Haedrich, Ingrid; Jordan, Dirk C.; Ernst, Marco","14 SOLAR ENERGY; 36 MATERIALS SCIENCE; yield prediction; cell to module analysis; thermal modelling; solar modules; module embedding","Solar cells and modules are usually optimized separately under standard test conditions (STC). However, the actual performance under field exposure depends on module design, installation and environmental conditions. This work therefore presents a methodology to predict the annual yield of crystalline silicon solar modules for varying module configurations and environments using a time step simulation approach. We define and quantify 12 effects that affect the annual module performance, starting with solar cells in air under STC to a complete module under realistic conditions. We consider the interaction of optical, thermal and electrical effects in the module and combine it with an angular, spectral and time resolved light source. The model enables understanding the impact of the module environment, such as regions with high wind speeds or high diffuse light, on the annual output of a particular module type. We validate our model with measured power and temperature data for crystalline silicon heterojunction solar cell modules and find an agreement of the annual yield within 0.7%. We quantify the annual gains and losses for this module and identify that major losses are caused by elevated operating temperatures (2.3%) and reflection losses at the front glass (2.6%). Critically, the coupling gains at the cell surface increase significantly by 1.5% when considering angular light irradiance compared to normal incidence. To conclude, we apply our Cell-to-Module-Yield method to a 72-cell mono-crystalline PERC module, where the main annual yield losses are caused by reflection at the front glass and ohmic losses in the connector ribbons.","Elsevier","","National Renewable Energy Lab.

However, passivation of a textured pyramidal surface to reduce carrier recombination is challenging due to the presence of sharp tips, edges, and valleys. Using electrical and surface microscopies combined with lifetime measurements, we report on the effect of HF:HNO3 etching on the pyramidal textured Si surface morphology, and on poly-Si/SiOx contact performance. Preferential rounding of either the valleys between pyramids, or the pyramid tips is obtained depending on the HF:HNO3 solution temperature. Both these morphologies make the pyramid shape irregular, with the pyramid faces no longer being predominantly a Si(111) surface. Our atomic force microscopy measurements further show that the nanoscale roughness over the pyramid face also reduces after HF:HNO3 etching. Thus, etching affects the microscopic pyramidal shape, the dominant crystallographic orientation, and the nanoscale roughness of the surface. We speculate that these three surface effects result in the improvement of surface passivation via poly-Si/SiOx contacts. However, this improved passivation is accompanied by increased reflectance of the HF:HNO3-etched textured surface. Finally, our electron-beam-induced current measurements reveal thickness nonuniformities in the thermally grown SiOx layer on the HF:HNO3-etched textured Si surface: SiO x is thicker near the pyramid tips, edges, and faces as compared with near the valleys between pyramids. This nonuniformity in the SiOx layer may explain the poorer passivation obtained on a KOH-textured and HF:HNO3-etched textured surface as compared with a planar surface.","IEEE","","National Renewable Energy Lab.

This study investigates the kinetics of carrier drift and bulk recombination following patterned illumination in commercial silicon heterojunctions with intrinsic thin layer (HIT) modules, comparing the kinetics between a ten-year field-weathered module versus a control module that is stored indoors. The measurement of the microwave photoconductance decay (uPCD) transients in the modules, both coincident with the photoexcitation and in nonilluminated cell regions, reveals carrier drift on the 100 us timescale, followed by millisecond bulk lifetimes. Importantly, the uPCD transients are consistent with luminescence spreading over the cell, which is imaged using a time-gated InGaAs array camera. The weathered HIT module shows slower lateral drift and faster bulk lifetimes compared with the control, suggesting increased series resistance and accelerated nonradiative recombination in this module, attributable to degradation of the transparent conductive oxide and degradation of the passivation layer, respectively. These results provide a novel example of using time-resolved measurements directly on full photovoltaic modules to reveal causes of degradation, providing insight for further development of module imaging and screening capabilities.","Wiley","","National Renewable Energy Lab.

An interlaboratory study was conducted involving different volunteer analysts reporting on the same photovoltaic performance data using different methodologies. Initial variability of the reported degradation rates was so high that analysts could not come to a consensus whether a system degraded or not. More consistent values are received when written guidance is provided to each analyst. Further improvements in analyst variance was accomplished by using the free open-source software RdTools, allowing a reduction in variance between analysts by more than two orders of magnitude over the first round, where multiple analysis methods are allowed.

Current solar panels use planar multi-junction, III-V based solar cells with very high efficiency, but their specific power (power to weight ratio) is limited by the added mass of radiation shielding (e.g. coverglass) required to protect the cells from the high-energy particle radiation that occurs in space. Here we demonstrate that III-V nanowire-array solar cells have dramatically superior radiation performance relative to planar solar cell designs and show this for multiple cell geometries and materials, including GaAs and InP. Nanowire cells exhibit damage thresholds ranging from ~10-40 times higher than planar control solar cells when subjected to irradiation by 100-350 keV protons and 1 MeV electrons. Furthermore, using Monte Carlo simulations, we show that this improvement is due in part to a reduction in the displacement defect generation within the wires arising from their nanoscale dimensions. Radiation tolerance, combined with the efficient optical absorption and the improving performance of nanowire photovoltaics, indicates that nanowire arrays could provide a pathway to realize high-specific-power, substrate-free, III-V space solar cells with substantially reduced shielding requirements. More broadly, the exceptional reduction in radiation damage suggests that nanowire architectures may be useful in improving the radiation tolerance of other electronic and optoelectronic devices.","American Chemical Society (ACS)","","National Renewable Energy Lab.

Due to intermittency of the sun, thermal energy storage is required to increase the capacity factor or the yearly utilization of the system. For this study, phase change material (PCM) is used to store the heat from the steam produced in the solar collector. Sodium formate is selected as the PCM material on a cost basis. A detailed off-design analysis is carried to predict the annual performance of the system. Fins are used to enhance the thermal performance of the PCM, and an simplified method is derived to predict the required fin mass. With an increase in the number of fins, the thermal performance of the system increases significantly at design point. Furthermore the fins are expensive, so an annual simulation and techno-economic analysis is carried to calculate the optimal number of fins and other operating parameters.","Elsevier","","National Renewable Energy Lab.

"Atmospheric Transmittance Model Validation for CSP Tower Plants","Hanrieder, Natalie; Ghennioui, Abdellatif; Merrouni, Ahmed Alami; Wilbert, Stefan; Wiesinger, Florian; Sengupta, Manajit; Zarzalejo, Luis; Schade, Alexander","14 SOLAR ENERGY; 47 OTHER INSTRUMENTATION; atmospheric extinction; attenuation loss; transmittance model; central receiver; solar resource assessment; CSP","In yield analysis and plant design of concentrated solar power (CSP) tower plants, increased uncertainties are caused by the mostly unknown solar attenuation between the concentrating heliostat field and the receiver on top of the tower. This attenuation is caused mainly by aerosol particles and water vapor. Various on-site measurement methods of atmospheric extinction in solar tower plants have been developed during recent years, but during resource assessment for distinct tower plant projects in-situ measurement data sets are typically not available. To overcome this lack of information, a transmittance model (TM) has been previously developed and enhanced by the authors to derive the atmospheric transmittance between a heliostat and receiver on the basis of common direct normal irradiance (DNI), temperature, relative humidity and barometric pressure measurements. Previously the model was only tested at one site. In this manuscript, the enhanced TM is validated for three sites (CIEMAT’s Plataforma Solar de Almería (PSA), Spain, Missour, Morocco (MIS) and Zagora, Morocco (ZAG)). As the strongest assumption in the TM is the vertical aerosol particle profile, three different approaches to describe the vertical profile are tested in the TM. One approach assumes a homogeneous aerosol profile up to 1 kilometer above ground, the second approach is based on LIVAS profiles obtained from Lidar measurements and the third approach uses boundary layer height (BLH) data of the European Centre for Medium-Range Weather Forecasts (ECMWF). The derived broadband transmittance for a slant range of 1 km (T<sub>1$km$</sub>) time series is compared with a reference data set of on-site absorption- and broadband corrected T<sub>1$km$</sub> derived from meteorological optical range (MOR) measurements for the temporal period between January 2015 and November 2017. The absolute mean bias error (MBE) for the TM’s T<sub>1$km$</sub> using the three different aerosol profiles lies below 5% except for ZAG and one profile assumption. The MBE is close to 0 for PSA and MIS assuming a homogeneous extinction coefficient up to 1 km above ground. The root mean square error (RMSE) is around 5–6% for PSA and ZAG and around 7–8% for MIS. The TM performs better during summer months, during which more data points have been evaluated. This validation proves the applicability of the transmittance model for resource assessment at various sites. It enables the identification of a clear site with high T<sub>1$km$</sub> with a high accuracy and provides an estimation of the T<sub>1$km$</sub> for hazy sites. Thus it facilitates the decision if on-site extinction measurements are necessary. The model can be used to improve the accuracy of yield analysis of tower plants and allows the site adapted design.","MDPI","","National Renewable Energy Lab.

However, wide-bandgap perovskite solar cells usually suffer from large open circuit voltage (V<sub>oc</sub>) deficits caused by small grain sizes and photoinduced phase segregation. Here, we demonstrate that in addition to large grain sizes and passivated grain boundaries, controlling interface properties is critical for achieving high V<sub>oc</sub>'s in the inverted wide-bandgap perovskite solar cells. We adopt guanidinium bromide solution to tune the effective doping and electronic properties of the surface layer of perovskite thin films, leading to the formation of a graded perovskite homojunction. The enhanced electric field at the perovskite homojunction is revealed by Kelvin probe force microscopy measurements. This advance enables an increase in the V<sub>oc</sub> of the inverted perovskite solar cells from an initial 1.12 V to 1.24 V. With the optimization of the device fabrication process, the champion inverted wide-bandgap cell delivers a power conversion efficiency of 18.19% and sustains more than 72% of its initial efficiency after continuous illumination for 70 h without encapsulation. Additionally, a semitransparent device with an indium tin oxide back contact retains more than 88% of its initial efficiency after 100 h maximum power point tracking.","Elsevier","","National Renewable Energy Lab.

Here, studies on intermediate-controlled crystal growth are reported to improve charge carrier transport in 2D perovskite thin films. It is shown that the coordination strength of solvents with perovskite precursor affects the initial state of intermediate phase formation as well as the subsequent perovskite layer growth. Tuning the solvent composition with a mixture (5:5) of dimethyl formamide (DMF) and dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO) leads to the growth of highly orientated 2D perovskite films with much-improved optoelectronic properties (faster transport by approx. ≈50x, longer carrier lifetime by approx. ≈4x, and lower defect density by approx. ≈30x) than the film prepared with pure DMF.

It also represents a means to control material properties, to far exceed the limits of equilibrium thermodynamics. We present a study of highly disordered Cu-Zn-Sn-S (d-CZTS) films along the Cu2SnS3-Cu2ZnSnS4-ZnS binary line, deposited by physical vapor deposition. Deposition at low temperature kinetically stabilizes compositions that are well outside of the narrow, equilibrium solid solution of kesterite (Cu2ZnSnS4). Here we study d-CZTS and its thermal treatment using complementary characterization techniques: X-ray absorption spectroscopy (XAS), X-ray diffraction (XRD), and transmission electron microscopy (TEM). We find that cations in d-CZTS are highly disordered while the sulfur anions remain in a well-defined, cubic close-packed lattice. On the atomic scale, composition fluctuations are accommodated preferentially by stacking faults. Kinetically-stabilized cation disorder can produce nonequilibrium semiconductor alloys with a wide range of band gap, electronic conductivity, and thermal conductivity. d-CZTS therefore represents a processing route to optimizing materials for optoelectronic device elements such as light absorbers, window layers, and thermal barriers.","","","National Renewable Energy Lab.

"Accelerating Photovoltaic Market Entry with Module Replacement","Jean, Joel; Woodhouse, Michael A; Bulovic, Vladimir","14 SOLAR ENERGY; 29 ENERGY PLANNING, POLICY, AND ECONOMY; photovoltaics; reliability; LCOE","Today's approach to deploying solar photovoltaics (PV) implicitly assumes that module technology is fixed. Solar panels are installed and expected to operate for the system life of 30 years or more. However, many PV technologies are improving rapidly along several dimensions, including cost, power conversion efficiency, and reliability. Periodic module replacement or planned repowering takes advantage of this technological improvement and counteracts predictable degradation. Here, we show that a module replacement strategy allows a competitive levelized cost of electricity to be achieved with an initial module lifetime of less than 15 years, assuming backward compatibility with the original system design. We also assess the life-cycle environmental impacts of module replacement and find that all commercial PV technologies offer benefits in the majority of impact categories, regardless of the replacement strategy, compared to today's electric generation mix. Module replacement can thus accelerate the market introduction and decarbonization impact of emerging PV technologies that have achieved a competitive module efficiency (=20%), cost (=$0.30/W), and lifetime (=10 years) and have the potential to improve further on all three metrics but lack decades-long field deployment experience.","","","National Renewable Energy Lab.

To help gauge these challenges to the power system, we quantify IAV of wind and solar resource and electricity generation across the Electric Reliability Council of Texas (ERCOT) power system, then assess the IAV of wind and solar electricity generation during peak-load hours (i.e., IAV of wind and solar capacity values) for the current ERCOT wind and solar generator fleet. To do so, we leverage the long timespan of four reanalysis datasets with the high resolution of grid integration datasets. We find the IAV (quantified as the coefficient of variation) of wind generation ranges from 2.3%-11% across ERCOT, while the IAV of solar generation ranges from 1.7%-5% across ERCOT. We also find significant seasonal and regional variability in the IAV of wind and solar generation, highlighting the importance of considering multiple temporal and spatial scales when planning and operating the power system. In addition, the IAV of the current wind and solar fleets' capacity values (defined as generation during peak load hours) are larger than the IAV of the same fleets' capacity factors. IAV of annual generation and capacity values of wind and solar could impact operations and planning in several ways, e.g. through annual emissions, meeting emission reduction targets, and investment needs to maintain capacity adequacy.","IOP Publishing","","National Renewable Energy Lab.

Browning, usually undetected unless severe, reduces the short-circuit current (Isc) produced by a module. Therefore, field-aged browned modules have been subjected to accelerated UV testing to obtain true end-of-life activation energy for the encapsulant browning mechanism. A novel time- and resource-saving accelerated UV exposure testing method simultaneously allowing multiple module temperatures to be maintained in a single chamber run is presented. Six field-aged crystalline silicon modules of glass/backsheet construction (three each from BP Solar/Solarex MSX 60 and Siemens M55) with similar glass and encapsulant formulation were exposed to a UV dosage of 450 kWh/m2 . Through passive heating, the average module temperatures for the BP Solar/Solarex modules were 60 degrees C, 77 degrees C, and 85 degrees C and those of Siemens M55 were 75 degrees C, 80 degrees C, and 837 degrees C. To study UV browning, the modules were intermittently characterized through visual imaging, UV fluorescence imaging, electroluminescence imaging, quantum efficiency measurements, module, and cell-level light I-V measurements. An Isc decrease corroborated the increased extent of browning with increased module temperature. For the BP Solar/Solarex modules, the Low T, Mid T, and the High T modules showed a 1.37%, 2.48%, and 3.26% Isc drop, respectively. The Siemens modules showed a 4.11%, 5.65%, and 6.95% Isc drop. The multiple cell-level Isc data points obtained for each module temperature increased provided statistical significance. Activation energy for encapsulant browning was calculated as 0.44 and 0.72 eV for MSX 60 and M55 modules, respectively.","","","National Renewable Energy Lab.

Here, we report on a simple approach based on molecular design of the organic spacer to improve the transport properties of 2D perovskites, and we use phenethylammonium (PEA) as an example. We demonstrate that by fluorine substitution on the para position in PEA to form 4-fluorophenethylammonium (F-PEA), the average phenyl ring centroid-centroid distances in the organic layer become shorter with better aligned stacking of perovskite sheets. The impact is enhanced orbital interactions and charge transport across adjacent inorganic layers as well as increased carrier lifetime and reduced trap density.

Here, we report a comparative study of Zn-Sn-Ti-O thin films materials using high-throughput experimental methods at National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) and National Renewable Energy Laboratory (NREL). The thin film sample libraries were synthesized by combinatorial physical vapor deposition (co-sputtering and pulsed laser deposition), and characterized by spatially-resolved techniques for composition, structure, thickness, optical and electrical properties. The results of this study indicate that all these measurement techniques performed at two different laboratories show excellent qualitative agreement.

These price reductions have relied primarily on falling system hardware costs. Future reductions in PV prices - which are needed to ensure that enough PV will be deployed to meet global clean energy objectives - will require reductions in non-hardware or 'soft' costs, particularly in markets with relatively high soft costs such as the United States. In this article, we draw insights from the literature on which factors affect soft costs for small-scale PV systems in the United States. The literature shows that soft costs tend to be lower for systems that are larger, installed during new construction, installed by more experienced installers, installed in more concentrated markets and in more competitive markets, installed in markets where customers receive more quotes, or installed in markets with less onerous permitting requirements. We identify three marketplace design strategies that policymakers could pursue to address the soft cost challenge in the United States and similar markets: encourage the expansion of quote platforms; encourage or require that PV system installation be integrated into the new construction and roof replacement process; and encourage the expansion of customer aggregation models such as Solarize campaigns and community solar.","Elsevier","","National Renewable Energy Lab.

These cycles have relatively high heat rejection temperatures (>70 degrees C), which are ideal for integration with multi-effect distillation (MED) for distillate generation from seawater, without being a parasitic load to the power plant as compared to cogeneration with steam Rankine cycle. The intermittency of solar radiation reduces the annual capacity factor of concentrating solar power (CSP) plants to about 50-60% even with a molten salt storage tank of 10-h. This reduces the annual distillate generation and increases the cost of the distillate. A novel concept to reduce distillate cost is introduced, whereby the waste heat from the sCO<sub>2</sub> Brayton cycle is stored. A two-tank demineralized water storage tank is selected and is shown to allow for the integration of a smaller MED system operating at an increased capacity factor. The optimal storage tank design reduces the distillate cost by 19% and increase the MED capacity factor from 46.4% to 75%. Different coastal locations with good solar resource are studied for cogeneration with the CSP-sCO<sub>2</sub> Brayton cycle.

During device operation we observe spatial de-alloying and phase segregation into the alloy’s constituent phases. Using complementary first-principles calculations of halide perovskite alloys a hypothesized framework explaining the experimentally observed mixing and demixing of these systems is presented and then validated using in-situ X-ray diffraction and time of flight secondary ion mass spectrometry. Taken together these results indicate that stability is not only a function of device architecture or chemical formulation, but that the processing strategy is critically important in synthesizing the most energetically favorable state and therefore the most stable device systems.

This is followed by discussing experimental results on the energetic alignment processes at the interfaces between the HaP and transport and buffer layers. This section includes understandings reached as well as commonly proposed and applied models, especially the often-questionable validity of vacuum level alignment, the importance of interface dipoles, and band bending as the result of interface formation (section 3). We follow this by elaborating on the impact of the interface formation on device performance, considering effects such as chemical reactions and surface passivation on interface energetics and stability. On the basis of these concepts, we propose a roadmap for the next steps in interfacial design for HaP semiconductors (section 4), emphasizing the importance of achieving control over the interface energetics and chemistry (i.e., reactivity) to allow predictive power for tailored interface optimization.","American Chemical Society","","National Renewable Energy Lab.

The Al<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub> and BSG samples increased the time to PID failure by 5x and 30x, respectively. The relationship among PID and coulombs transferred from the substrate to the device through leakage current differed depending on the sample type. When the (unrepresentative) dark PID stress test was interrupted to characterize devices with light/electrical bias, PID was partially reversed. Furthermore, applying high voltage stress to open-circuit devices was less damaging, relative to forward-biased and short-circuited cells. Light/electrical bias may therefore reduce PID by driving alkali metal cations away from the p-n junction to diminish their degrading effects. These results show that device light/electrical bias should be carefully controlled during CIGS PID testing, as it affects PID in addition to leakage current.","IEEE","","National Renewable Energy Lab.

Studies on bulk CdTe crystals have shown that much higher acceptor concentration than the traditional copper treatment is possible with As, P or Sb, enabled by high process temperature and/or rapid thermal quenching under Cd overpressure. We report a comprehensive study on in-situ As doping of poly-crystalline CdTe solar cells by MOCVD, whereby high acceptor densities, approaching 3 x 10<sup>16</sup> cm<sup>-3</sup> were achieved at low growth temperature of 390 degrees C. No As segregation could be detected at grain boundaries, even for 10<sup>19</sup> As cm<sup>-3</sup>. A shallow acceptor level (+0.1 eV) due to As<sub>Te</sub> substitutional doping and deep-level defects were observed at elevated As concentrations. Devices with variable As doping were analysed. Narrowing of the depletion layer, enhancement of bulk recombination, and reduction in device current and red response, albeit a small near infrared gain due to optical gap reduction, were observed at high concentrations. Device modelling indicated that the properties of the n-type window layer and associated interfacial recombination velocity are highly critical when the absorber doping is relatively high, demonstrating a route for obtaining high cell voltage.","Elsevier","","National Renewable Energy Lab.

As power systems increasingly shift towards wind and solar power, these resource changes will increasingly impact power system operations. We assess how power system operations will be affected by climate change impacts on wind and solar resources by generating wind and solar generation profiles for a reference period and five climate change projections. We then run a unit commitment and economic dispatch model to dispatch a high-renewable generator fleet with these profiles. For climate change projections, we use 2041–2050 output from five global climate models (GCMs) for Representative Concentration Pathway 8.5 for Texas, our study system. All five GCMs indicate increased wind generation potential by 1%–4% under climate change in Texas, while three and two GCMs indicate increased and decreased solar generation potential, respectively, by up to 1%. Uneven generation potential changes across time result in greater changes in dispatched generation by fuel type. Notably, nuclear generation decreases across GCMs by up to 7%, largely in low-demand (winter) months when nuclear plants, which have a high minimum stable load, must reduce their generation to avoid overgeneration. Increased wind and/or solar generation result in reduced system CO<sub>2</sub> emissions and electricity production costs across four of the five GCMs by 8–16 million tons and $216–516 million, or by 2% and 1%, respectively. Future research should assess the atmospheric and climate dynamics that underlie such changes in power system operations.","IOP Publishing","","National Renewable Energy Lab.

Using electron beam induced current (EBIC) measurements, we accurately map nanoscale conduction-enabling pinholes in 2.2 nm thick SiOx layers in a poly-Si/SiO<sub>x</sub>/c-Si stack. These conduction enabling pinholes appear as bright spots in EBIC maps due to carrier transport and collection limitations introduced by the insulating 2.2 nm SiO<sub>x</sub> layer. Performing high-resolution transmission electron microscopy at a bright spot identified with EBIC reveals that conduction pinholes in SiO<sub>x</sub> can be regions of thin tunneling SiO<sub>x</sub> rather than a geometric pinhole. Additionally, selectively etching the underlying poly-Si layer in contacts with 1.5 and 2.2 nm thick SiO<sub>x</sub> layers using tetramethylammonium hydroxide results in pinhole-like etch features in both contacts. However, EBIC measurements for a contact with a thinner, 1.5 nm SiO<sub>x</sub> layer do not reveal pinholes, which is consistent with uniform tunneling transport through the 1.5 nm SiO<sub>x</sub> layer. Finally, we theoretically show that reducing the metal to the c-Si contact size from microns, like in the p-type passivated emitter rear contact, to tens of nanometers, like in poly-Si contacts, allows lowering of the unpassivated contact area by several orders of magnitude, thus resulting in excellent passivation, as has been demonstrated for these contacts.","American Institute of Physics (AIP)","","National Renewable Energy Lab.

The characterization sequence combines traditional global cell measurements (e.g., current-voltage, Suns-VOC) with camera-based cell imaging of voltage distribution and power dissipation from photoluminescence and lock-in thermography, respectively. Spatial variations in current collection are visualized using a high-speed external quantum efficiency and reflectance measurement technique. A nondestructive transfer length method (TLM) measurement technique is also implemented, featuring circular TLM structures hidden within the busbars of the cells. The variance of individual loss parameters and their impact on cell performance are quantified for this large group of cells. Based on correlations performed across parameters, recombination losses in the bulk and rear surface of the cell are shown to be the primary limiting factor for the cell efficiency. The nature of these distributions and correlations provide important insights about loss mechanisms in industrial solar cells, helping to prioritize efforts for optimizing the performance of the production line. Additionally, many of the parameters extracted from these techniques can be tied back to incoming material quality issues (e.g., poor bulk carrier lifetime, nonuniform wafer doping) and to individual unit processes (e.g., texturing, phosphorus diffusion, silicon nitride deposition, metallization), allowing the data to be used directly for process control in manufacturing.

The study showed a liftoff and delamination, respectively, for the bi and tri stack layers of Ag frit/Ni and Ag frit/Ni/Cu fired above 790 degrees C peak firing temperature. The 770 degrees C peak firing temperature gave excellent electrical performance for both bi and tri stack layer contacts, which is not favorable to forming thick back surface field (BSF) required for high open circuit voltage (VOC). This suggests that the bilayer and trilayer contacts involving Ag frit are limited to low peak firing temperature, but Ni frit, on the other hand, showed a wider firing temperature range. This is supported by low reverse saturation current density (J02) of 1.1 x 10-11 A/cm2 and high shunt resistance (RSH) of 5750 ..omega.. cm2 for the Ni frit fired at 800 degrees C peak firing temperature. More so, the adhesion of Ni Frit to silicon is better than Ag counterpart as evidenced in the SEM micrograph. Thus, by adopting RTP Ni/Cu contacts, the cost of metallization of solar cell can be dropped from 35% of total processing cost to only 5% to 6%, which is approximately 30% drop in the total cost of processing.","Wiley","","National Renewable Energy Lab.

Solar cells were grown with MgZnO window layers and compared to cells with CdS window layers containing varying amounts of oxygen. It was demonstrated that band alignment rather than reduced recombination velocity is the reason for the success of MgZnO as a front interface contact. An assortment of thin back contact interlayers were also deposited, and a PbTe interlayer showed some promise as an Ohmic contact to the CdTe, though it appears to induce a photoconductive shunt.

Studies of real-world backsheet degradation provide valuable information to understand backsheet degradation and failure. Field surveys of PV module backsheets were conducted on 1310 modules in four commercial PV power plant sites with different exposure times. The backsheet's local exposure environment is determined by its location along the rack length and depth, the modules' elevation above the ground, and the ground cover albedo. Backsheets that are installed at the ends of the module rack length exhibit larger degradation rates (with yellowness index difference of 1.14 $\pm$ 0.45 and 7.80 $\pm$ 1.3 for backsheets of poly (ethylene terephthalate) and poly (ethylene naphthalate) as the air-side layer, respectively) than backsheets in the center section of the rack. A generalized spatio-temporal model was developed to predict the large-scale backsheet degradation of different backsheet polymers across time/age and location in the PV power plant rack. The model utilizes a cubic-spline relationship between backsheet degradation and rack length, and a quadratic relationship between backsheet discoloration and rack depth. This generalized spatio-temporal model predicts the outdoor backsheet degradation with an adjusted- $R^2$ range between 0.31 to 0.89. The similarity between this model and the spatial variation of the rear-side irradiance, indicates that the irradiance plays a significant role in outdoor backsheet degradation. The generalized spatio-temporal model can be used to evaluate large scale PV backsheet performance, as well as a guidance for PV site designers and operations and maintenance crews.","","","National Renewable Energy Lab.

"Use of indentation to study the degradation of photovoltaic backsheets","Miller, David C.; Owen-Bellini, Michael; Hacke, Peter L.","14 SOLAR ENERGY; 36 MATERIALS SCIENCE; backsheet; durability; instrumented indentation; nanoindentation; reliability","The ability of electrical insulating materials within a module to act as insulators is a key safety requirement for photovoltaic (PV) technology. Presently, however, the durability of backsheets may not be readily assessed. For example, the mechanical tensile test continues to be developed, and its use has not been validated such that a technically based pass/fail criteria may be established. This study examines the use of simple indentation methods, including durometer hardness and instrumented indentation, as a means to quantitively assess the degradation of PV backsheets. Characteristics including: hardness, modulus, load/displacement profile, creep hold response, and residual impression are explored in an empirical study. Glass/encapsulant/backsheet mini-modules constructed using backsheets including: polyamide (PA), poly(ethylene terephthalate) (PET), polyvinyl fluoride (PVF) laminate ('TPE'), and polyvinylidene fluoride (PVDF) were examined. An M-type durometer as well as Berkovich and cube-corner tips were used in the indentation experiments. Additional characterizations were performed to interpret the indentation measurements including: surface roughness measurements using atomic force microscopy (AFM), a chemical integrity study using Fourier-transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR), and phase-transition measurements using differential scanning calorimetry (DSC). The results are analyzed in the context of the combined accelerated stress test (C-AST) also explored in this study. Instrumented indentation (i.e., using a Berkovich tip) was able to distinguish between backsheets and quantify the effects of accelerated testing (including up to 60%, 25%, and 20% change in hardness, modulus, and creep displacement, respectively). The embrittlement of the backsheets was not readily assessable using cube-corner indentation. Cracking of the known-bad polyamide backsheet was observed from the C-AST, which was not observed to result from steady state UV weathering.","Elsevier","","National Renewable Energy Lab.

The internal interconnection scheme of the subcells is an important aspect in determining the resulting levelized cost of electricity. For a dual-junction cell, two approaches are commonly discussed: series-connected tandem cells with two terminals or independently working subcells in a four-terminal (4T) tandem device. In this paper, we explore the working principle and the operation modes of a third, rarely discussed option: a three-terminal (3T) tandem cell using a back-contacted bottom cell with 3Ts. We use current-voltage measurements of illuminated 3T interdigitated back contact cells and confirm that the front and rear base contacts are at similar quasi-Fermi level positions, which enables the bottom cell to either efficiently collect surplus carriers, in the case of a current-limiting or carrier injecting top cell, or inject majority carriers, in the case of a current-limiting bottom cell. As a result, no current matching is needed. The power output of an idealized 3T bottom cell without resistive effects is independent of the current density applied from the top cell. These characteristics of the 3T bottom cells enable a 3T tandem to operate as efficiently as a 4T tandem, while being compatible with monolithic design and not requiring intermediate grids. We propose a simple equivalent circuit model including additional resistive effects, which describes a real 3T bottom cell and achieves excellent agreement to the experiment. We deduce design guidelines for a 3T bottom cell in different operation regimes.","Wiley","","National Renewable Energy Lab.

"Back-surface recombination, electron reflectors, and paths to 28% efficiency for thin-film photovoltaics: A CdTe case study","Duenow, Joel N.; Metzger, Wyatt K.","14 SOLAR ENERGY; 36 MATERIALS SCIENCE; CdTe; lifetime; back surface recombination; electron reflector","As thin-film and silicon solar technologies mature, questions emerge about the upper bounds of thin-film solar performance and realistic experimental paths to reach them. Directions include increasing absorber hole density and bulk lifetime, improving the junction interface, reducing back-surface recombination, and implementing a back-surface electron reflector. Textbook solutions of idealized p-n junctions create a powerful conceptualization of solar cells as predominantly minority-carrier-driven devices. We demonstrate that thin films are distinct, and models often fail to capture the important role of majority-carrier lifetime, leading to contradictions with lifetime measurements and overestimates of potential device improvement from back-surface passivation and/or reflectors. Furthermore, we identify methods to probe majority-carrier lifetime and re-examine the degree to which back-surface passivation and electron reflectors can increase efficiency for a range of common thin-film interface and absorber properties, using current and emerging CdTe technology as an example. Here, the results indicate that a practical approach is to focus first on improving front-interface recombination velocity and the absorber properties, and then on implementing the back-surface passivation or reflector, which can ultimately allow thin-film solar technology to reach 28% efficiency.","American Institute of Physics (AIP)","","National Renewable Energy Lab.

"Emerging Design Principles for Enhanced Solar Energy Utilization with Singlet Fission","Gish, Melissa K.; Pace, Natalie A.; Rumbles, Garry; Johnson, Justin C.","14 SOLAR ENERGY; 36 MATERIALS SCIENCE; singlet fission; charge separation; energy transfer; acenes; quantum dots","Singlet fission (SF), the generation of two triplet excitons per the absorption of one photon, is a promising strategy for increasing the efficiency of solar cells beyond the theoretical Shockley-Queisser limit of 34%. Upon photon absorption by a SF molecule, the initially created singlet excited state (S1) interacts with a neighboring chromophore and is first transformed into a triplet pair (TT), which can be subsequently separated into independent triplet excitons (2T1). These independent triplet excitons can be harvested through triplet charge extraction or triplet energy transfer to an acceptor. Research on SF systems has revealed rates and efficiencies of triplet formation and triplet pair decorrelation that are strongly dependent on interchromophore coupling, which is dictated by molecular structure and the resulting geometrical arrangement of chromophores adopted in covalent (e.g., dimers) and noncovalent (e.g., films and crystals) systems. Incorporation of SF materials into realistic device architectures introduces a host of new challenges to consider regarding the efficient extraction of triplets generated through SF. In this Feature Article, we review our work that has led to some degree of understanding and control of inter- and intramolecular SF rates placed in the context of solar energy harvesting architectures, including dye-sensitized solar cells, conjugated polymer films, and ligand-exchanged quantum dots. We emphasize the importance of understanding and manipulating interactions between SF molecules with each other and with the charge or energy collectors across an interface in order to strike a kinetic balance that leads to efficient utilization of triplet excitons.","American Chemical Society","","National Renewable Energy Lab.

"Supercritical Carbon Dioxide Power Cycle Design and Configuration Optimization to Minimize Levelized Cost of Energy of Molten Salt Power Towers Operating at 650 °C","Neises, Ty; Turchi, Craig","14 SOLAR ENERGY; 47 OTHER INSTRUMENTATION; concentrating solar power; supercritical CO2 cycle; recompression cycle; partial-cooling cycle","This analysis investigates the design, cost, and performance of the simple, recompression, and partial-cooling configurations of the supercritical carbon dioxide power cycle integrated with a molten salt power tower concentrating solar power system. This paper uses a steady-state model to design each cycle with varying amounts of recuperator conductance to understand performance and cost trade-offs. The recompression cycle can achieve a higher thermal efficiency than the partial-cooling cycle, and the partial-cooling cycle achieves a higher thermal efficiency than the simple cycle. The partial-cooling cycle is the most expensive cycle because it requires more total turbomachinery capacity. However, the partial-cooling cycle has the largest temperature range of heat input. This feature leads to cheaper two-tank thermal energy storage, higher receiver efficiencies, and lower mass flow rates in the power tower. Crucially, the lower mass flow rates significantly reduce pump electricity consumption relative to the recompression-cycle system. Consequently, this study finds that the power tower system integrated with the partial-cooling cycle is both cheaper and generates more net electricity than systems integrated with the other two cycles. Finally, this paper presents a parametric study on the air-cooler approach temperature and shows that small approach temperatures can improve cycle efficiency and increase the temperature range of heat input, which can lead to smaller optimal approach temperatures than may be expected.","Elsevier","","National Renewable Energy Lab.

Compared to other fields in data science, the openness and accessibility of solar data is lacking, which prevents solar data science from catching up with the emerging trends of data science (e.g., deep learning). In this paper, OpenSolar, a package with both R and Python versions, is developed to enhance the openness and accessibility of publicly available solar datasets. The OpenSolar package provides access to multiple types of solar data, primarily from four datasets: (1) the National Renewable Energy Laboratory (NREL) Solar Power Data for Integration Studies dataset, (2) the NREL Solar Radiation Research Laboratory dataset, (3) the Sheffield Solar-Microgen database, and (4) the Dataport database. Unlike other open solar datasets that only contain meteorological data, the four datasets in the OpenSolar package also contain behind-the-meter power data, sky images, and solar power data with satisfactory temporal and spatial resolution and coverage. The overview, quality-control methods, and potential usage of the datasets, in conjunction with sample code implementing the OpenSolar functions, are described in this paper. The package is expected to assist in bridging the gaps between the research fields of solar energy, power systems, and data science.","","","National Renewable Energy Lab.

Concurrent band excitation piezoresponse force microscopy–contact Kelvin probe force microscopy shows that the measured response is not dominated by spurious electrostatic interactions. Large signal poling (>16 V/cm) orients the permanent polarization into large domains, which show stabilization over weeks.

Film conductivity was interrogated by measuring the in-phase and out-of-phase forces acting between the film and a charged microcantilever. We followed the films' conductivity versus time, frequency, light intensity, and temperature (233-312 K). Perovskite conductivity was high and light-independent over ITO and NiO. Over TiO2 and SnO2, the conductivity was low in the dark, increased with light intensity, and persisted for 10's of seconds after the light was removed. At an elevated temperature over TiO2, the rate of conductivity recovery in the dark showed an activated temperature dependence (Ea = 0.58 eV). Surprisingly, the light-induced conductivity over TiO2 and SnO2 relaxed essentially instantaneously at a low temperature. We use a transmission-line model for mixed ionic-electronic conductors to show that the measurements presented are sensitive to the sum of electronic and ionic conductivities. We rationalize the seemingly incongruous observations using the idea that holes, introduced either by equilibration with the substrate or via optical irradiation, create iodide vacancies.","American Chemical Society","","National Renewable Energy Lab.

Thus, we introduce a concept termed thermal energy grid storage, which in this embodiment uses multi-junction photovoltaics as a heat engine. We report promising initial experimental results that suggest it is feasible and could meet the low cost required to reach full penetration of renewables. The approach exploits an important tradeoff between the realization of an extremely low cost per unit energy stored, by storing heat instead of electricity directly, and paying the penalty of a lower round trip efficiency. To understand why this tradeoff is advantageous, we first introduce a general framework for evaluating storage technologies that treats round trip efficiency, as well as cost per unit energy and power, as variables.","Royal Society of Chemistry","","National Renewable Energy Lab.

Within the PSC device stack, charge-selective contact selection has been shown to considerably impact PSC stability. Recently, a triarylamine-based hole-transport layer (HTL) doped with its oxidized organic salt analogue (EH44/EH44-ox) has been shown to bypass the need for hygroscopic lithium salt dopants, enabling high PSC stability in ambient conditions. Despite these promising results, the improved stability came with a power conversion efficiency (PCE) penalty and poor performance above 30 degrees C. Broadening the applicability and understanding of this under-utilized dopant system, we report design criteria for stable, synthetically simple triarylamine-based organic hole transport materials (HTM) and their corresponding oxidized salts as HTL dopants for improved PSC efficiency and stability at elevated temperature. The triarylamine-based dopants must contain at least two para-electron donating groups for radical cation stabilization to prevent impurity formation (e.g., dopant reduction) which significantly reduces PSC fill factors (FF) and PCE. To further improve PSC FF and PCE, these dopants can be interchanged with respect to the HTL matrix. The stability of unencapsulated devices prepared with these three new HTLs, under constant load and illumination, considerably outperform both EH44/EH44-ox and Li+-doped spiro-OMeTAD controls at 50 degrees C. The ability to mix and match a stable dopant with a non-identical small-molecule-based HTL matrix for improved charge-transport properties broadens design scope for highly stable and cost-effective PSC without sacrificing performance.","American Chemical Society (ACS)","","National Renewable Energy Lab.

The CST system uses an array of mirrors to focus sunlight, and the concentrated solar flux is applied to a solar receiver to collect and convert solar energy into thermal energy. The thermal energy then drives a thermal power cycle for electricity generation or provides an energy source to chemical processes for material or fuel production. Considerable interest in CST energy systems has been driven by power generation, with its capability to store thermal energy for continuous electricity supply or peak shaving. However, CST systems have other potential to convert solar energy into fuel or to support thermochemical processes. Thus, we introduce the concept of a chemical-looping configuration integrated with the CST system that has potential applications for thermochemical energy storage or solar thermochemical hydrogen production. The chemical-looping configuration integrated with a CST system consists of the following: a solar-receiver reactor for solar-energy collection and conversion, thermochemical energy storage, a reverse reactor for energy release, and system circulation. We describe a high-temperature reactor receiver that is a key component in the chemical-looping system. We also show the solar-receiver design and its performance analyzed by solar-tracing and thermal-modeling methods for integration within a CST system.","ASME","","National Renewable Energy Lab.

"A Fast All-sky Radiation Model for Solar applications with Narrowband Irradiances on Tilted surfaces (FARMS-NIT): Part II. The cloudy-sky model","Xie, Yu; Sengupta, Manajit; Wang, Chenxi","14 SOLAR ENERGY; 29 ENERGY PLANNING, POLICY, AND ECONOMY; radiative transfer; cloud; solar radiation; satellite remote sensing; solar resource assessment; numerical weather prediction","The Fast All-sky Radiation Model for Solar applications with Narrowband Irradiances on Tilted surfaces (FARMS-NIT) reported in Part I of this report is enhanced to include the requirements for cloudy-sky conditions. Surface radiances in 2002 narrow-wavelength bands from 0.28 to 4.0 um are analytically computed by solving the radiative transfer equation for five independent photon paths accounting for clear-sky absorption, Rayleigh scattering, and cloud absorption and scattering. The Simple Model of the Atmospheric Radiative Transfer of Sunshine (SMARTS) is used to show the optical thickness of the clear-sky atmosphere. Unlike Part I, which approximates the computation of aerosol scattering using the single-scattering phase function, the cloud transmittance and reflectance are efficiently retrieved from a comprehensive look-up table pre-computed by a 32-stream DIScrete Ordinates Radiative Transfer (DISORT) model for possible cloud conditions as well as solar and viewing geometries. A resolution assessment is performed to observe the optimal balance between the computational efficiency and accuracy in the development of the look-up table. Model simulations by DISORT and TMYSPEC are used to evaluate the performance of FARMS-NIT under cloudy-sky conditions. Compared to DISORT, FARMS-NIT yields 2-3% uncertainties on average, but it substantially reduces the computational time because of the independent computation of cloud properties and the implementation of the look-up table. In contrast to TMYSPEC, which uses successive steps to empirically compute plane-of-array (POA) irradiances and spectral irradiances, FARMS-NIT directly solves spectral radiances from the radiative transfer equation, which profoundly increases the accuracy in surface irradiances, especially over inclined photovoltaics (PV) panels.","Elsevier","","National Renewable Energy Lab.

Multiple characterization techniques are combined - Kelvin probe force microscopy, electron-beam induced current, dark lock-in thermography, transmission electron microscopy, time-of-flight secondary-ion mass spectrometry, and microwave photoconductance decay - as well as density functional theory (DFT) calculations. These characterization techniques and theoretical calculations are complementary in various aspects of a material's chemical, structural, electrical, and optoelectrical nature, as well as in atomic, nanometer, micrometer, millimeter, and cell and module scales. All results point consistently to a new discovery: substantial large-area deterioration of materials and junctions play a major role in c-Si PID (in addition to the previously reported local shunting defect caused by Na diffusion to planar defects). Furthermore, this new finding reveals a key PID component and leads to a new strategy for tailoring c-Si photovoltaics to ultimately resolve the PID issue.","Wiley","","National Renewable Energy Lab.

The two modules under analysis were manufactured in 1984 with the nameplate power of 41.0 W, but degraded under two different conditions; one was operated in the field in Northern California for about 30 years, and the other was stored in a warehouse for the same period. The power outputs of the two modules measured in 2016 are as 28.4W for the field-exposed one and 35.9 W for the warehoused one. We further break down this power difference of 7.5 W +/- 0.3 W to specific physical mechanisms. Through the encapsulant transmittance measurements and the circuit modeling of module I-V curves, the power degradation due to encapsulant discoloration is found as 59% +/- 4% of the total difference. With the bias-dependent electroluminescence imaging and the dark I-V measurement of solar cells (via the additionally-attached probe wires), the series-resistance increase is attributed to 33% +/- 1%, with the split of 13% +/- 4% due to interconnection resistance and 20% +/- 4% due to cell resistance. In addition, the synergistic effect of all the physical mechanisms makes up the remaining 8% +/- 4%. This case study presents an example of analyzing multiple degradation mechanisms of the PV modules. With more characterization data being collected for today's modules, the same analysis framework can be broadly applied, yield great insights module power degradation attributed to multiple loss mechanisms.","","","National Renewable Energy Lab.

The design requirements for high pressure (=20 MPa) and high temperature (=700 °C) operation associated with sCO<sub>2</sub> posed several challenges requiring high-strength materials for piping and/or diffusion bonding for plates. Designs from several vendors for a 100 kW-thermal particle-to-sCO<sub>2</sub> heat exchanger were evaluated as part of this project. Cost, heat-transfer coefficient, structural reliability, manufacturability, parasitics and heat losses, scalability, compatibility, erosion and corrosion, transient operation, and inspection ease were considered in the evaluation. An analytic hierarchy process was used to weight and compare the criteria for the different design options. The fluidized-bed design fared the best on heat transfer coefficient, structural reliability, scalability, and inspection ease, while the moving packed-bed designs fared the best on cost, parasitics and heat losses, manufacturability, compatibility, erosion and corrosion, and transient operation.

Practical implementation requires an interconnection approach that maximizes efficiency and minimizes complexity and cost. Connecting the top and bottom cells in a voltage-matched configuration allows two-terminal modules to be fabricated without altering the cell design or processing methods. Here, we experimentally demonstrate two-terminal voltage-matched GaInP<sub>2</sub> / Si minimodules. The two-terminal minimodules performed just as well as four terminal configurations when voltage-matching requirements were met. The magnitude of the efficiency loss experienced by the voltage-matched minimodule when voltage-matched conditions were not met depends on whether the voltage was constrained by the GaInP<sub>2</sub> or Si cells. Monte Carlo simulations also indicate that the two-terminal voltage-matched tandems respond to small cell-to-cell parameter variations in a similar manner as four terminal tandems.","SPIE","","National Renewable Energy Lab.

Partial illumination induces local photovoltage variations that drive lateral current flow into non-illuminated cell regions, causing the average injection level to vary over the course of luminescence measurement. The extent of lateral current depends on material properties and is especially significant for high-efficiency devices such as the silicon heterojunction with intrinsic thin layer (HIT) modules that we investigate. We compare four module imaging methods including large-area illumination, scanning-laser illumination, contactless electroluminescence, and pattern-illuminated photoluminescence. By evaluating the statistical correlation among the different methods under varying laser fluences, we conclude that most methods converge to similar results at matched photon dose per cell (not laser power density) for the modules that we study, while pattern-illuminated photoluminescence yields distinct images from the other techniques regardless of the illumination power. Our combined analysis using multiple luminescence imaging techniques gives specific insight into the causes of HIT module degradation, including suspected degradation of the transparent conductive oxide and passivation layer.","Elsevier","","National Renewable Energy Lab.

Focusing on the low fluence limit near the onset of biexciton formation, excitation conditions were precisely controlled and characterized by averaging Poisson-distributed excitation statistics over all three spatial dimensions of the pump and probe beam spatial profiles to determine the average excitation probability. A saturation model is developed to uniquely decompose the pump-probe signal into singleexciton and biexciton signals. This method harnesses the distinct pump-fluence scaling of absolute pump-probe signals from singly and doubly excited QDs without any assumptions regarding the relative time scales or amplitudes of single-exciton and biexciton signals. Probing in the bulklike region of the QD absorption spectrum, the signal from biexcitons is found to be 1.8 times the signal from single excitons at T = 0, consistent with the conventionally assumed factor of 2 within the 95% confidence intervals. The biexciton signal contains the same hot-carrier relaxation dynamics as that from single excitons, but signal from a second exciton additionally exhibits a 26 ps exponential decay attributed to Auger recombination.","American Chemical Society","","National Renewable Energy Lab.

Despite the evident structural differences with respect to standard perovskite solar cells (PSCs), similar impedance spectra were obtained for PQDSCs, pointing to similar working principles in terms of the active layer. We distinguish two different regimes: At low illumination, recombination is ruled by multiple trapping with trap distributions and/or shunting. However, at higher light intensities, Shockley-Read-Hall recombination is observed. In addition, the low-frequency capacitance, CLF, of PQDSCs increases several orders of magnitude when the illumination is varied from dark to 1-sun conditions. This feature has not been observed in other kinds of photovoltaic devices and is characteristic of PSCs. Although there is no consensus about the exact mechanism responsible for CLF, the suggested models point to an ion migration origin. Its observation in thin-film and PQDSCs devices implies a similar effect in both.","American Chemical Society (ACS)","","National Renewable Energy Lab.

"Floating Photovoltaic Systems: Assessing the Technical Potential of Photovoltaic Systems on Man-Made Water Bodies in the Continental United States","Spencer, Robert S.; Macknick, Jordan; Aznar, Alexandra; Warren, Adam; Reese, Matthew O.","14 SOLAR ENERGY; 29 ENERGY PLANNING, POLICY, AND ECONOMY; floating; PV; technical potential; geospatial; water; energy","We report that floating photovoltaic (FPV) systems, also called floatovoltaics, are a rapidly growing emerging technology application in which solar photovoltaic (PV) systems are sited directly on water. The water-based configuration of FPV systems can be mutually beneficial: Along with providing such benefits as reduced evaporation and algae growth, it can lower PV operating temperatures and potentially reduce the costs of solar energy generation. Although there is growing interest in FPV, to date there has been no systematic assessment of technical potential in the continental United States. We provide the first national-level estimate of FPV technical potential using a combination of filtered, large-scale datasets, site-specific PV generation models, and geospatial analytical tools. We quantify FPV co-benefits and siting considerations, such as land conservation, coincidence with high electricity prices, and evaporation rates. Our results demonstrate the potential of FPV to contribute significantly to the U.S. electric sector, even using conservative assumptions. A total of 24?419 man-made water bodies, representing 27% of the number and 12% of the area of man-made water bodies in the contiguous United States, were identified as being suitable for FPV generation. FPV systems covering just 27% of the identified suitable water bodies could produce almost 10% of current national generation. Lastly, many of these eligible bodies of water are in water-stressed areas with high land acquisition costs and high electricity prices, suggesting multiple benefits of FPV technologies.","American Chemical Society (ACS)","","National Renewable Energy Lab.

"Automatic Detection of Clear-Sky Periods From Irradiance Data","Ellis, Benjamin H.; Deceglie, Michael; Jain, Anubhav","14 SOLAR ENERGY; 47 OTHER INSTRUMENTATION; classification algorithms; solar energy","© 2019 IEEE. Recent degradation studies have highlighted the importance of considering cloud cover when calculating degradation rates, finding more reliable values when the data are restricted to clear sky periods. Several automated methods of determining clear sky periods have been previously developed, but parameterizing and testing the models has been difficult. In this paper, we use clear sky classifications determined from satellite data to develop an algorithm that determines clear sky periods using only measured irradiance values and modeled clear sky irradiance as inputs. This method is tested on global horizontal irradiance (GHI) data from ground collectors at six sites across the United States and compared against independent satellite-based classifications. First, 30 separate models were optimized on each individual site at GHI data intervals of 1, 5, 10, 15, and 30 min (sampled on the first minute of the interval). The models had an average F0.5 score of 0.949 ± 0.035 on a holdout test set. Next, optimizations were performed by aggregating data from different locations at the same interval, yielding one model per data interval. This paper yielded an average F0.5 of 0.946 ± 0.037. A final, 'universal' optimization that was trained on data from all sites at all intervals provided an F0.5 score of 0.943 ± 0.040. The optimizations all provide improvements on a prior, unoptimized clear sky detection algorithm that produces F0.5 scores that average to 0.903 ± 0.067. Our paper indicates that a single algorithm can accurately classify clear sky periods across locations and data sampling intervals.","IEEE","","National Renewable Energy Lab.

Real dust particles and silica spheres as surrogate to simulating dust particles were glued to AFM probe cantilevers. The electric field induced force (Fes) was measured via AFM force-distance (f-z) curves, where the electric field was generated by applying a voltage (Vs) to a simulated PV module. Fes and van der Waals (Fvw) force contributions could be separated with the f-z curves. The results show that Fes ~2.5 u N on dust particles is ~5 times larger than Fvw ~0.5 u N at even Vs = -100 V (i.e., similar to large-module operating voltages). Fes increases by an order of magnitude as the applied potential increases from Vs = -100 V to Vs = -500 V. These adhesion forces are by far the strongest that we have measured using the AFM technique for 'initial' contact of particles. Furthermore, unlike the more typical short-range forces of Fvw and liquid bridge, Fes extends sub-millimeters to a millimeter beyond the PV module surface, creating large attraction forces to even uncharged dust particles (i.e., via induced dipoles) in the air. These results indicate that the high voltages typically used with PV arrays today will attract more dust particles from the air, hold the dust particles to the surface very strongly, and potentially induce other PV module surface effects, all of which could increase the power production losses because of soiling.","","","National Renewable Energy Lab.

"Electrochemical mechanisms of leakage-current-enhanced delamination and corrosion in Si photovoltaic modules","Li, Jichao; Shen, Yu-Chen; Hacke, Peter; Kempe, Michael","14 SOLAR ENERGY; 36 MATERIALS SCIENCE; water reduction reaction; hydrogen; corrosion; delamination; leakage current","This paper analyzes the mechanisms for corrosion and delamination observed in Si photovoltaic modules subjected to high temperature and humidity with a negative-ground bias testing. Based on the thermodynamic data, the ionic component of the leakage current causes reduction reactions of water on the cathodic metallization, producing hydrogen gas and hydroxide ions. Ag fingers are strong catalysts for this reduction reaction compared to other materials used in solar cells and can be the initiation sites of corrosion and delamination caused by the electrochemical reactions. The produced hydrogen gas accumulates inside the module potentially producing a high gas pressure that can promote delamination, which is often preferentially initiated on metallization where the adhesion strength is lower [1], [2], [3]. The local basicity near the metal surface increases due to the hydroxide ion generation. Thus, the environment inside the encapsulant can be alkaline despite the presence of acetic acid decomposition products from the encapsulant. Corrosion of materials such as Si used in solar cells occurs and the extent depends on their corrosion resistance to the alkaline solution. This suggests that corrosion and delamination are interactive and promote the formation and propagation of one another.","Elsevier","","National Renewable Energy Lab.

In this work, we demonstrate a technique to lift off thin-film solar cells from their glass substrates in a clean, reproducible manner by first laminating a polymeric backsheet to the device and then thermally shocking the system at low temperatures (T ≤ -30 degrees C). To enable clean delamination of diverse thin-film architectures, a theoretical framework is developed and key process control parameters are identified. Focusing on cadmium telluride (CdTe) devices, we show that the lamination temperature and device architecture control the quality of lift-off, while the rate at which the film stack is removed is controlled by the delamination temperature. Crack-free CdTe devices are removed and successfully recontacted, recovering up to 80% of the original device efficiency. The areal density of these devices is ~0.4 kg m<sup>-2</sup>, a reduction of over an order of magnitude relative to their initial weight on glass.

Higher annual energy yield is a crucial factor (even more than to further reduce the module costs) because, with the use of higher power PV modules, the high BOS (Balance of System) costs can be reduced, resulting in the lowest LCOE (levelised cost of energy). The International Technology Roadmap for Photovoltaic (ITRPV) predicts an upward trend for the shares of crystalline silicon (c-Si) bifacial PV cells and modules in the global PV market in the next decade, i.e., more than 35% in 2028. Two key enabling factors have been identified to promote the widespread use of c-Si bifacial PV devices, namely the bifacial PV performance measurement method/standard for indoor characterisation and comprehensive simulation models for outdoor performance characterisation. Both will increase the bankability of bifacial PV technology. In this paper, a comprehensive review of the state-of-the-art of the c-Si bifacial PV performance characterisation and simulation is presented. First, an overview of the indoor characterisation of c-Si bifacial PV cells and modules is presented, followed by an overview of the outdoor characterisation of c-Si bifacial PV modules and the draft technical specification, IEC TS 60904-1-2. The second part of this paper reviews the current status of bifacial PV performance modelling, which includes the three primary sub-models: optical, electrical, and thermal models. This paper also provides an overview of the required future research to address the challenges associated with the characterisation and simulation of c-Si bifacial PV devices.","Royal Society of Chemistry","","National Renewable Energy Lab.

We find that the residential systems considered in this study tended to show more system energy-yield degradation than the nonresidential systems considered here. Within the nonresidential systems, we find differences in the degradation rates associated with module technology - namely, that systems built with interdigitated-back-contact module technology tended to show slower degradation than conventional silicon or silicon heterojunction modules. We also find that in older nonresidential systems, degradation proceeded more rapidly later in system life. Within the residential systems considered here, we find that those exposed to more shade tended to show more rapid energy-yield degradation. Finally, considering both residential and nonresidential systems, we observe that higher operating temperature is correlated with more rapid degradation. The fleet-scale analysis demonstrated here highlights the importance of using a robust scalable analysis to consider large numbers of systems in order to identify factors associated with degradation risk.","IEEE","","National Renewable Energy Lab.

"Correlating Photovoltaic Soiling Losses to Waveband and Single-Value Transmittance Measurements","Micheli, Leonardo; Cabellero, Jose A.; Fernandez, Eduardo F.; Smestad, Greg P.; Nofuentes, Gustavo; Mallick, Tapas K.; Almonacid, Florencia","14 SOLAR ENERGY; 47 OTHER INSTRUMENTATION; soiling; photovoltaic; reliability; spectral losses; optical transmittance","This paper presents the results of an investigation on the spectral losses of photovoltaic (PV) soiling. The transmittance of a glass coupon exposed to natural soiling outdoors in Jaen, southern Spain, has been measured weekly and used to estimate the soiling losses that various types of photovoltaic materials would experience if installed in the same location. The results suggest that measuring the hemispherical transmittance of the soiling accumulated on a PV glass coupon can give enough information to quantify the impact of soiling on energy production. Each PV technology is found to have a preferred spectral region, or a specific single wavelength, for which the transmittance through a PV glass coupon could be used for the best estimation of soiling losses. Overall, considering the average spectral transmittance between the extreme wavelengths of the material-specific absorption band, or the transmittance of soiling at a single wavelength between 500 and 600 nm yields the best estimations for different PV technologies. The results of this work can lead to innovative approaches to detect soiling in the field and to estimate the impact of spectral changes induced by soiling on PV energy production.","","","National Renewable Energy Lab.

One important advantage is high specific power (the power-to-weight ratio). Here we consider niche market size, price points and value propositions that can provide a path for new PV market entrants. Examining the cost-production experience curves of Si, CdTe and CIGS PV suggests that a minimum market size of US$0.2-1 billion is required to incubate a new market entrant. Several markets requiring high specific power meet this threshold. We assess the critical role of the substrate, packaging and interconnects and provide a quantitative assessment of pathways to maximize specific power. With all requisite components included, along with requirements for safety and reliability, we estimate a lower bound for a durable lightweight module at about 300-500 g m<sup>-2</sup>. Lastly, pairing this bound with a 15%-efficiency thin-film or 35%-efficiency III-V module would yield specific powers up to 500 W kg<sup>-1</sup> or 1,167 W kg<sup>-1</sup>, respectively.","Nature Publishing Group","","National Renewable Energy Lab.

These panels are considered to be one of the cleanest energy production systems available, so their spread is expected to increase in the following years, especially because recent technologies have reduced the cost of these panels. Unlike classic energy production methodologies that are connected to the high-voltage transmission power lines, many PV panels are connected directly to the lower voltage distribution networks of the electric power grid, making the management of the grid an ongoing challenge. In this letter, we address this challenge and show that the irradiance field that is required to calculate the expected power output of the PV panels can be estimated in a simplistic methodology, using partial observability of the solar radiation. We validate our proposed methodology by conducting an empirical study that uses real data of the solar radiation taken from satellites, and we show that even when the observability of the solar radiation is as low as 10% (meaning that only one in ten points of interest in a regular grid is observable), the irradiance field can be accurately estimated.","IEEE","","National Renewable Energy Lab.

"A stochastic downscaling approach for generating high-frequency solar irradiance scenarios","Zhang, Wenqi; Kleiber, William; Florita, Anthony R.; Hodge, Bri -Mathias; Mather, Barry A.","14 SOLAR ENERGY; 47 OTHER INSTRUMENTATION; Irradiance modeling; high-resolution; stochastic; non-Gaussian","Solar power is increasingly cost viable with solar photovoltaic (PV) installations becoming commonplace. PV planning and operational studies, however, require high-frequency solar irradiance scenarios to understand potential electric grid impacts due to the variability and uncertainty of the underlying solar resource. Existing remote sensing solar data products are often available over large spatial domains, but are limited in temporal resolution. For example, the global horizontal irradiance (GHI) component contained within the National Solar Radiation Database (NSRDB) is available at time resolution of 30 min on an approximately four-kilometer grid. In contrast, substantial solar variability is present at finer time scales and this article describes an algorithm to stochastically generate one-minute GHI from widely available sub-hourly NSRDB. A generalized linear modeling (GLM) framework is proposed, which includes non-Gaussian mixtures, and extends the literature involving the synthesis of GHI data. The model is trained on a set of sample locations around Oregon, USA, and validated across the USA using both the Surface Radiation Budget Network (SURFRAD) dataset and Solar Radiation Monitoring Laboratory (SRML) network. Simulated ensembles show good coverage properties and temporal correlation structure. The resulting downscaled ensembles allow for understanding the unpredictable variability inherent in GHI at locations without direct measurements. Here, future work can leverage the algorithm as part of a stochastic optimization of electric grid operations with high-penetration PV systems.","Elsevier","","National Renewable Energy Lab.

In contrast to our prior D-HVPE devices, grown at 650 °C in a transport-limited regime, these devices were grown at 700 °C in a kinetically-limited growth regime in which the growth rate uniformity is controlled by thermally-activated surface reactions. These devices exhibit open-circuit voltages up to 1.07 V, nearly identical performance to the devices grown at lower temperature in a different growth regime. We evaluate the uniformity of device performance and find only a 1% variation in absolute, device efficiency across the majority of the wafer in devices without anti-reflection coating. We analyze the GaAs and GaInP thickness uniformity and GaInP compositional uniformity, using high-tresolution x-ray diffraction mapping, and find that any non-uniformity in device efficiency is not related to variations in these structural parameters. We combine three-dimensional computational fluid dynamics modeling of our reactor with a kinetic model for GaAs growth, and use the combined model to predict spatial GaAs growth rate over a 50 mm wafer area. We compare these predictions with experimental data from our D-HVPE reactor and find excellent agreement. We use the model to the gain insight into the specific mechanisms that control GaAs spatial uniformity in the kinetically-limitedgrowth regime. Furthermore, these results suggest a large parameter window for the growth of high-performance optoelectronic devices by D-HVPE, possibly with large area uniformity.","Elsevier","","National Renewable Energy Lab.

Two different types of clear-sky detection (CSD) methods are discussed: those (16 total) that attempt to isolate periods of 1-min or more cloudless conditions, and those (5 total) that only attempt to detect clear-sun periods. All methods are found to rely on a diversity of inputs and on a variety of tests that typically examine the smoothness of the temporal variation of global and/or direct irradiance. Using samples of a few days with variable cloudiness, it is shown that these methods all have obvious strengths and weaknesses. Although this justifies a detailed validation to determine which method(s) could be best suited in the practice of solar radiation modeling or other applications, the current lack of appropriate equipment at high-quality reference radiometric stations prevents such an endeavor. Only a preliminary study is conducted here at seven stations of the SURFRAD network in the U.S., where 1-min irradiance measurements are available, along with sky data from a Total Sky Imager (TSI). The many limitations of the latter prevent its data to be considered 'ground truth' here. Nevertheless, the comparison of the results from all CSD methods and 1.2 million TSI observations from all SURFRAD sites provides important qualitative and quantitative information, using a variety of performance indicators. Overall, two CSD methods appear more robust and are recommended, pending better high-resolution and high-performance cloud observations from modern sky cameras to redo these tests.","","","National Renewable Energy Lab.

The results of this work, which considers the largest pool of soiling data points systematically investigated so far, confirm that a single-variable regression based on particulate matter concentration returns the best correlations with soiling, with adjusted coefficients of determination up to 70%, corresponding to RMSE as low as 0.9%. Among the various particulate matter datasets investigated, a gridded Environment Protection Agency dataset is for the first time found to return correlations similar to those obtained by interpolating particulate matter monitoring station data. We discuss in detail the different interpolation techniques used to process the particulate matter concentrations because they can greatly impact the correlations. Specifically, the correlation coefficients between soiling and particulate matter range between 70% and less than 20%, depending on the interpolation methods and monitoring distance. Spatial interpolation methods based on inverse distance weighting are found to return better correlations than a nearest neighbor or a simple average approach, especially when large distances are considered. Similarly, the effects of different rain thresholds used to calculate the length of the dry periods are examined. An enhanced two-variable regression is found to achieve higher-quality correlations, with adjusted R2 of 90% (RMSE = 0.55%), also suggesting that high and low soiling locations might be differentiated depending on fixed particulate matter or rainfall thresholds.","Wiley","","National Renewable Energy Lab.

"Model for Characterization and Optimization of Spectrally Selective Structures to Reduce the Operating Temperature and Improve the Energy Yield of Photovoltaic Modules","Slauch, Ian M.; Deceglie, Michael G; Silverman, Timothy J; Ferry, Vivian E.","14 SOLAR ENERGY; 42 ENGINEERING; photonic structures; solar cells; photovoltaic modules; cooling; photovoltaic outdoor modeling; solar energy","Many existing commercially manufactured photovoltaic modules include a cover layer of glass, commonly coated with a single layer antireflection coating (ARC) to reduce reflection losses. As many common photovoltaic cells, including c-Si, CdTe, and CIGS, decrease in efficiency with increasing temperature, a more effective coating would increase reflection of sub-bandgap light while still acting as an antireflection coating for higher energy photons. The sub-bandgap reflection would reduce parasitic sub-bandgap absorption and therefore reduce operating temperature. This reduction under realistic outdoor conditions would lead to an increase in annual energy yield of a photovoltaic module beyond what is achieved by a single layer ARC. However, calculating the actual increase in energy yield provided by this approach is difficult without using time-consuming simulation. Here, we present a time-independent matrix model which can quickly determine the percentage change in annual energy yield of a module with a spectrally selective mirror by comparison to a baseline module with no mirror. The energy benefit is decomposed into a thermal component from temperature reduction and an optical component from increased transmission of light above the bandgap and therefore increased current generation. Time-independent matrix model calculations are based on real irradiance conditions that vary with geographic location and module tilt angle. The absolute predicted values of energy yield improvement from the model are within 0.1% of those obtained from combined ray-tracing and time-dependent finite-element simulations and compute 1000x faster. Uncertainty in the model result is primarily due to effects of wind speed on module temperature. Optimization of the model result produces a 13-layer and a 20-layer mirror, which increase annual module energy yield by up to 4.0% compared to a module without the mirror, varying depending on the module location and tilt angle. Finally, we analyze how spectrally selective mirrors affect the loss pathways of the photovoltaic module.","","","National Renewable Energy Lab.

Achieving long-term stability under operation conditions is critical for reaching market success for PSC applications. Despite impressive progress over the past few years on fundamental understandings and technical innovations for improving PSC stability, the stability of PSCs against moisture/heat/light is still a key focus of research efforts for PSC development. Recent studies suggest that the long hydrophobic organic spacer in two-dimensional (2D) perovskites is helpful to improve perovskite stability, but 2D perovskites seem limited on obtaining high-performance solar cells due to its wide optical bandgaps and limited charge transport. To overcome this challenge, 3D/2D multidimensional perovskites - with an intermediate dimensionality between 3D and 2D - has recently emerged as a potential candidate to simultaneously maintain long-term stability and high performance. In this review, we first present a detailed discussion of the structure of 3D/2D multidimensional perovskites and their unique properties. Second, we discuss the stability of 3D/2D multidimensional perovskite and 2D perovskite as interface engineering layer-based solar cells.

Here, we investigated the cooperation of a Lewis base and a Lewis acid by combining commercial bis-PCBM mixed isomers as the Lewis acid in the antisolvent and <em>N</em>-(4-bromophenyl)thiourea (BrPh-ThR) as the Lewis base in the perovskite solution precursor. The combination of the Lewis base and the Lewis acid synergistically passivates Pb<sup>2+</sup> and PbX<sup>3–</sup> antisite defects, enlarges the perovskite grain size, and improves charge-carrier separation and transport, leading to improved device efficiency from 19.3% to 21.7%. In addition, this Lewis base and acid combination also suppresses moisture incursion and passivates pinholes generated in the hole-transporting layer. Furthermore, the unsealed devices remained at 93% of the initial efficiency value in ambient air (10–20% relative humidity) after 3600 h at 20–25 °C and dropped by 10% after 1500 h under continuous operation at 1-sun illumination and 55 °C in nitrogen with maximum power-point tracking.","Royal Society of Chemistry","","National Renewable Energy Lab.

A fracture mechanics approach based on a single cantilever beam technique is employed to measure the delamination rate as a function of applied driving force. To glean insight into the mechanisms of bonding and degradation at this interface, and the effect of manufacturing variability and quality, we consider a high-quality pristine EVA and two EVAs formulated with reduced amounts of its adhesion promoter, silane. Results indicate that a bulk change in the viscoelastic properties of the EVA dominates the delamination kinetics at high driving forces and low humidity and the effect of a chemical reaction only becomes apparent at higher humidity and lower driving forces. These findings suggest that only interfacial phenomenon of susceptible, degraded material may have to be considered to adequately model PV module delamination failure.","IEEE","","National Renewable Energy Lab.

EVA samples laminated with glass particles are used to demonstrate the effect of damp heat exposure on the glass-EVA interface, showing that increasing silane content increases chemical stability. Delamination interfaces created in one cell modules demonstrate a high correlation between the siloxane bonding at the silicon cell-EVA interface and the debond energy. A significant decrease in debond energy after UV exposure is also shown to be due in part to decreasing siloxane bond density at the interface. However, FTIR results indicated contributions to the adhesion beyond the chemical interface, and a basic tensile test indicates increasing bulk mechanical properties with increasing silane. These results demonstrate the importance of the EVA formulation on its adhesion performance and long-term reliability. Furthermore, it is shown that FTIR is a capable technique for assessing and quantifying chemical mechanisms within PV modules. These results can then be used to more effectively model module lifetimes and to better design polymer systems for PV modules.","IEEE","","National Renewable Energy Lab.

"Surface albedo and reflectance: Review of definitions, angular and spectral effects, and intercomparison of major data sources in support of advanced solar irradiance modeling over the Americas","Gueymard, Christian A.; Lara-Fanego, Vicente; Sengupta, Manajit (ORCID:0000000156224503); Xie, Yu","14 SOLAR ENERGY; 47 OTHER INSTRUMENTATION; surface albedo; irradiance; reflectance; backscattering; bifacial PV; NSRDB","This study defines albedo and reflectance in the context of solar applications. It examines the main sources of surface albedo data that can be used to help solar irradiance modeling efforts, such as undertaken by the National Renewable Energy Laboratory (NREL) over the Americas, for instance, per the National Solar Radiation Database (NSRDB). The MODIS-based albedo database, as used as input to derive historical time series of solar irradiance in the current version of the NSRDB, is compared to other sources of global gridded data over the Americas in general and some specific areas in particular. The particular role of snow cover is analyzed. It is found that, in the current MODIS-based NSRDB implementation, snow-impacted areas have been assigned a too high albedo in general because of the lack of consideration for the antagonistic effect of surface roughness, among other factors. Other albedo databases, such as CMSAF, MINES-ParisTech or the ERA5 reanalysis, do not display such high albedos at latitudes above ~40 degrees N. The gap-free and snow-free MODIS MCD43GF product is found affected by a long-term downward trend over some areas and out-of-phase seasonal effects over other areas, in comparison with MERRA-2 reanalysis data in particular. Comparisons with actual albedo measurements at the arid Desert Rock site in Nevada also show that albedo data derived from land surface models are affected by systematic bias. Five albedo databases are intercompared for the area around Ivanpah Playa, California, which has great importance in both remote sensing and solar applications. Various aspects of the proper usage of albedo data in solar radiation modeling are discussed, regarding calculations of both the backscattering process and reflections on a tilted surface: spatial resolution, temporal resolution, angular effects, and spectral effects. An important distinction is made between the use of albedo data at ~4 km resolution for backscattering calculations and at ~10 m resolution for transposition calculations to tilted planes, which might additionally require spectral information for monofacial or bifacial PV applications. It is shown that the tilted calculations usually performed in solar resource assessments are far from realistic in the case of most large-scale PV applications, for which a more suitable methodological approach is described. For such needs, the limitations of the current sources of high-resolution reflectance data are discussed. The impact of surface albedo estimation errors on the estimation of backscattered irradiance over snowy areas is evaluated. It is found non-negligible, and even large under cloudy conditions.","Elsevier","","National Renewable Energy Lab.

This process involves the chemical looping of an active redox pair that cycles between a metal nitride and its complementary metal oxide to yield NH<sub>3</sub>. To identify promising candidates for STAS cycles, we performed a high-throughput thermodynamic screening of 1,148 metal nitride/metal oxide pairs. This data-driven screening was based on Gibbs energies of crystalline metal oxides and nitrides at elevated temperatures, G(T), calculated using a recently introduced statistically learned descriptor and 0 K DFT formation energies tabulated in the Materials Project database. Using these predicted G(T) values, we assessed the viability of each of the STAS reactions - hydrolysis of the metal nitride, reduction of the metal oxide, and nitrogen fixation to reform the metal nitride - and analyzed a revised cycle that directly converts between metal oxides and nitrides, which alters the thermodynamics of the STAS cycle. For all 1148 redox pairs analyzed and each of the STAS-relevant reactions, we implemented a Gibbs energy minimization scheme to predict the equilibrium composition and yields of the STAS cycle, which reveals new active materials based on B, V, Fe, and Ce that warrant further investigation for their potential to mediate the STAS cycle. This work details a high-throughput approach to assessing the relevant temperature-dependent thermodynamics of thermochemical redox processes that leverages the wealth of publicly available temperature-independent thermodynamic data calculated using DFT. This approach is readily adaptable to discovering optimal materials for targeted thermochemical applications and enabling the predictive synthesis of new compounds using thermally controlled solid-state reactions.","American Chemical Society (ACS)","","National Renewable Energy Lab.

High upfront costs, however, are often a barrier to adoption, even when costs may be offset by future energy savings. Through a series of randomized experiments, we examine whether framing strategies grounded in behavioral economics and psychology can be used to increase the financial appeal of such products. Using mock ads for residential solar photovoltaics (PV), we test four frames: gain/loss framing, temporal framing, varied savings amounts, and simple vs. detailed savings calculations. Overall, we find that reframing the financial benefits of PV does not greatly influence the appeal of solar or the likelihood to respond to the mock ads. Instead, underlying consumer motivations and predispositions (i.e., perceived social support, consumer innovativeness, and personal pro-environmental norms) are the primary factors driving interest in adopting solar. Our findings suggest that tailoring messages to targeted consumer segments may be more effective than attempts to market the financial benefits of PV to broad audiences. Furthermore, the results also contribute to behavioral economics and psychology research by identifying contexts under which the gain/loss framing bias and the present/future framing bias may not apply.","Elsevier","","National Renewable Energy Lab.

"Hysteresis Index: A Figure without Merit for Quantifying Hysteresis in Perovskite Solar Cells","Habisreutinger, Severin N.; Noel, Nakita K.; Snaith, Henry J.","14 SOLAR ENERGY; 36 MATERIALS SCIENCE; perovskite solar cells; hysteresis; figure of merit","Not long after the breakthrough publications on lead halide perovskite-based solar cells, researchers noticed something peculiar about these devices: the current-voltage scans, the most common technique to determine a solar cell's efficiency, yielded different results depending on the scan direction. In the very first swathe of publications, researchers neglected discussing this observation, opting to simply publish the scan that yielded the higher efficiency. However, this was untenable as this scan-direction dependence clearly indicated that the absorber system was undergoing a transient change due to the external bias, and as such, the scanned measurements were yielding non-steady-state values. Unger et al.(1) and Snaith et al.(2) proposed two approaches to remedy this issue, both of which sought to take the unknown, internal changes of the material into account by devising steady-state measurements. This was done by either significantly slowing down the scan rate, such that the system was allowed to reach steady state at each point of the scan, or by measuring the stabilized or steady-state photocurrent at the maximum power point voltage. The advantage of the former technique is that performance parameters such as the short-circuit current (Jsc), open-circuit voltage (Voc), fill factor (FF), and series resistance can be determined with high fidelity. The latter has the advantages of being much faster to perform, allowing for rapid estimation of the performance of a multitude of cells, and enabling approximation of the solar cell performance under actual operating conditions. The community largely acknowledged and debated the phenomenon of hysteresis, but only slowly took up either of the two recommendations.","American Chemical Society (ACS)","","National Renewable Energy Lab.

A fit of GI intensity vs. grain size data with the CL model gives a self-consistent and representative set of S<sub>GB</sub> and t<sub>GI</sub> values for the samples: S<sub>GB</sub> (t<sub>GI</sub>) = 2.6 x 10<sup>6</sup> cm/s (68-250 ps), S<sub>GB</sub>(t<sub>GI</sub>) = 4.1 x 10<sup>5</sup> cm/s (1.5-3.3 ns), and S<sub>GB</sub> (t<sub>GI</sub>) = 5.5 x 10<sup>5</sup> cm/s (1.0-3.8 ns) for as-deposited, CdCl<sub>2</sub>-treated, and CdCl<sub>2-</sub> A nd Cu-treated samples, respectively. Thus, we find that the CdCl2 treatment both helps to passivate GBs and significantly increase the GI lifetime. Subsequent Cu diffusion increases GB recombination slightly and has nuanced effects on the GI lifetime. Finally, as a partial check on the S<sub>GB</sub> and t<sub>GI</sub> values, they are input to a Sentaurus device model, and the simulated performance is compared to the measured performance. The methodology developed here can be applied broadly to CdTe and CdSeTe thin-film technology and to other thin-film solar cell materials including Cu(In<sub>1-x</sub>Ga<sub>x</sub>)Se<sub>2</sub>, Cu<sub>2</sub>ZnSnS<sub>4</sub>, and perovskites.","American Institute of Physics (AIP)","","National Renewable Energy Lab.

This is partly due to changes that occur at the front interfaces during high temperature growth and substantive changes occurring during postdeposition processing. In addition, these buried interfaces are extremely difficult to access in a way that preserves chemical information. In this work, we use a recently developed thermomechanical cleaving technique paired with X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy to probe oxidation states at the SnO<sub>2</sub> interface of CdTe solar cells. We show that the tin oxide front electrode promotes the formation of nanometer-scale oxides of tellurium and sulfur. Most oxidation occurs during CdCl<sub>2</sub>/O<sub>2</sub> activation. Surprisingly, we show that relatively low-temperature anneals (180-260 degrees C) used to diffuse and activate copper acceptors in a doping/back contact process also cause significant changes in oxidation at the front of the cell, providing a heretofore missing aspect of how back contact processes can modify device transport, recombination, and performance. Device performance is shown to correlate with the extent of tellurium and sulfur oxidation within this nanometer-scale region. Mechanisms responsible for these beneficial effects are proposed.","American Chemical Society (ACS)","","National Renewable Energy Lab.

Bifacial energy gains (BG <sub>E</sub>) as high as 20% are predicted for some configurations. Model agreement is generally good for low ground clearance (clearance heights lower than 0.75 times the collector width), but at higher clearances, finite system size and edge effects become a significant factor in simulations, stretching assumptions of infinite system extent made in some models. In addition, rear irradiance uniformity is improved at high ground clearance, as expected.

Postmortem investigations reported that tripping commands were caused by phase-locked loops (PLLs) and dc-side dynamics, which are typically unmodeled in transient stability studies. Since existing simulation packages rely on simplified models that neglect these dynamics, they have a limited capability to predict converter behavior during faults. To address this shortcoming, we set forth a positive-sequence model for PV power plants that is derived from physics and controls first principles. As seen on utility-scale three-phase converters, the model includes PLLs, dc-side dynamics, and closed-loop controllers. Instances of the developed model are integrated into illustrative power systems containing also conventional generators. Numerical simulations of the obtained multi-machine multi-converter power systems are assessed via a suitable set of stability and performance metrics.","IEEE","","National Renewable Energy Lab.

Exciton harvesting was probed with photoluminescence quenching measurements. Accelerated photodegradation studies of polymer:fullerene blends were then carried out under white light illumination at ~1.2 suns in air.

However, the toxicity and instability of best-in-class lead-halide perovskite materials make them nonideal. To combat these issues, we replaced lead with bismuth and explored the sensitivity of these new lead-free materials to the valency and bonding of their cationic organic groups. Specifically, we synthesized and characterized the materials properties and photophysical properties of hexane-1,6-diammonium bismuth pentaiodide ((HDA2+)BiI5) and compared them to an analogue containing a more volatile organic group with half the number of carbon and nitrogen atoms in the form of n-propylammonium ((PA+)xBiI3+x, where 1 < x < 3). The full crystallographic structures of (HDA2+)BiI5 and (PA+)xBiI3+x were resolved by single-crystal X-ray diffraction. (HDA2+)BiI5 was shown to be pure-phase and have a one-dimensional structure, whereas (PA+)xBiI3+x was shown to be a mix of one-dimensional and zero-dimensional phases. Structures of the materials were confirmed by synchrotron X-ray diffraction of powders. Both (HDA2+)BiI5 and (PA+)xBiI3+x exhibit steady-state photoluminescence at room temperature. Density functional theory calculations of (HDA2+)BiI5 predict electronic absorption features and a ~2 eV bandgap that are consistent with those observed experimentally. Structure-property relationships of the materials were examined, and moisture tolerance and film quality were found to be superior for dication-containing (HDA2+)BiI5 in relation to monocation-containing (PA+)xBiI3+x. We hypothesize that these trends are in part due to a molecular bridging effect enabled by the presence of the dicationic hexanediammonium groups in (HDA2+)BiI5. Solar cells fabricated using (HDA2+)BiI5 as the photoactive layer exhibited photovoltaic action while those containing (PA+)xBiI3+x did not, suggesting that organic dicationic groups are beneficial to light-absorber morphology and ultimately solar-cell performance.","","","National Renewable Energy Lab.

The electrical insulation for the backsheets is discussed relative to: the industry safety requirement; features observed to facilitate the degradation of insulation; the validity of the artificial UV weathering test; the validity of the sheet geometry used for specimens in this study; and the validity of subsequent mechanical testing.","Elsevier","","National Renewable Energy Lab.

"Model and Validation of Single-Axis Tracking with Bifacial PV","Ayala Pelaez, Silvana; Deline, Christopher A; Greenberg, Peter; Stein, Joshua S.; Kostuk, Raymond K.","14 SOLAR ENERGY; bifacial photovoltaic module; configuration factor; irradiance; model; performance; ray tracing; single-axis tracking","Single-axis tracking is a cost-effective deployment strategy for large-scale ground-mount photovoltaic systems in regions with high direct-normal irradiance. Bifacial modules in 1-axis-tracking systems boost energy yield by 4%-15% depending on module type and ground albedo, with a global average of 9%. This benefit is in addition to the 15%-25% energy gain already afforded by single-axis tracking relative to fixed-tilt deployments. Here, we compare model results against field performance data for two side-by-side bifacial/monofacial tracked systems - one in Albuquerque, NM, USA, and one in eastern Oregon. The Albuquerque system shows monthly rear irradiance gain of 10%-14.9%, and the Oregon bifacial system has an average performance ratio 9.4% higher than the monofacial system. Both results match bifacial irradiance model results within uncertainty. Simulations show that smart tracking algorithms can offer more than 1% improvement on annual energy yield by adjusting tilt angle under cloudy conditions. Finally, ray-tracing simulations investigated edge brightening, suggesting a 15%-25% increase in rear irradiance at the ends of tracker rows, but up to 20% loss from center-mounted torque tubes, creating multiple shadows.","","","National Renewable Energy Lab.

Tabula Rasa is especially effective in n-Cz wafers with oxygen concentration >15 ppma. Vacancies, self-interstitials, and their aggregates result from TR as a metastable side effect. Temperature-dependent lifetime spectroscopy reveals that these metastable defects have shallow energy levels ~0.12 eV. Their concentrations strongly depend on the ambient gases during TR because of an offset of the thermal equilibrium between vacancies and self-interstitials. However, these metastable defects anneal out at typical cell processing temperatures =850 degrees C and have little effect on the bulk lifetime of the processed cell structures. Without dissolving built-in oxygen precipitate nuclei, high-temperature solar cell processing severely degrades the minority carrier lifetimes to below 0.1 millisecond, while TR-treated n-Cz wafers after the cell processing steps exhibit carrier lifetimes above 2.2 milliseconds.","Wiley","","National Renewable Energy Lab.

On the other hand, postgrowth treatment of Al<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub>/CdTe structures with CdCl<sub>2</sub> and oxygen causes regrowth of Te oxides.

"Using Willingness to Pay to Forecast the Adoption of Solar Photovoltaics: A ''Parameterization + Calibration'' Approach","Dong, Changgui; Sigrin, Benjamin","14 SOLAR ENERGY; 29 ENERGY PLANNING, POLICY, AND ECONOMY; solar photovoltaics; willingness to pay; adoption forecasting; parameterization; calibration","Distributed energy resources, such as rooftop solar photovoltaics (PV), are likely to comprise a substantial fraction of new generation capacity in the United States. However, forecasting technology adoption based on people's willingness to pay (WTP) faces two major challenges: the stated-intention and omitted-variable biases. Previous solar adoption literature has neglected to address these two biases altogether. Here, we adopt a 'parameterization + calibration' approach to address both biases and estimate customers' WTP for PV. After collecting survey data on respondents' WTP for adopting PV, we characterize its empirical cumulative density function using a gamma distribution. We further calibrate the gamma distribution parameters using a national distributed PV adoption simulation model, finding the parameters that produce the best fit between simulated and historic solar adoption. We then show that the calibrated gamma distribution improves the raw WTP data after correcting for the two biases. Finally, we use our optimally-calibrated WTP to forecast market demand for residential PV at the county-level of the United States in 2020. Improving estimates of customer willingness to pay has significant implications for policy directly, e.g. estimating the effect of a proposed policy on technology adoption, and other regulatory processes that use forecasting, e.g. integrated resource planning.","Elsevier","","National Renewable Energy Lab.

The studied regions originate from the same photovoltaic mini-module, which was subjected to one-sun light exposure at a temperature of 100 degrees C for 400 h to induce light and heat degradation. EDS maps reveal a discontinuous CdS layer and particles rich in O and S but Te-depleted within the CdTe absorber layer after the light and heat stress. These features could act as enhanced recombination centers, resulting in decreased photovoltaic conversion efficiency. Additionally, the most degraded CdTe sample shows a strong accumulation of Na precisely localized in the discontinuous part of the CdS layer. The local Na concentration is determined to be ~16 at.%. In addition, appreciable Na accumulation is observed at the soda-lime glass/transparent conductive oxide interface in both degraded CdTe solar cells. The microstructure of the baseline CdTe mini-module with no stress was also investigated to demonstrate that the structure difference was caused by the light- and heat-induced degradation, instead of module fabrication. These results highlight the need to control the distribution of Na in fielded CdTe modules to sustain long-term high-power output.","IEEE","","National Renewable Energy Lab.

In addition to four-terminal and two-terminal tandem cell architectures, a new three-terminal tandem cell architecture has recently been demonstrated, which features a standard two-terminal (front-back) circuit as well as an interdigitated back contact (IBC) circuit connected to the bottom cell. It has no middle contacts, and thus, maintains some of the simplicity of a two-terminal tandem. In this study, we measure four-terminal GaInP//Si and GaInP/GaAs//Si tandem cells in four-terminal and three-terminal configurations by connecting wires to mimic a three-terminal architecture. We demonstrate that both modes allow the same efficiencies exceeding 30% to be attained. Furthermore, we show that the IBC circuit not only collects excess power from the bottom cell, but that it can inject power into the bottom cell if it is current limiting the front-back circuit, enabling four-terminal performance in monolithic structures, regardless of which cell delivers less current.","IEEE","","National Renewable Energy Lab.

In cell-level studies, in particular, we propose the adoption of transferrable and flexible testing protocols. We believe that the adoption of standard testing protocols could dramatically improve the translatability of insights between laboratories working in this area worldwide; however, improved protocols alone will by no means replace the need for mechanistic insight into degradation mechanisms at all levels of perovskite solar cell stability.

The current intensity versus voltage (J-V) characteristics of GaIn/n-c-Si/SiO<sub>x</sub>/n<sup>+</sup>-poly-Si/Al structures shows a linear Ohmic characteristic, while a non-Ohmic behavior is observed in the samples without the n<sup>+</sup>-poly-Si contact layer. Conductive Atomic Force Microscopy (c-AFM) images reveal some current spikes on the surface of the samples, which could be related to the transport through pinholes. The simulation results show that 1) a rectification characteristic is obtained when only the tunneling mechanism is included, 2) both the reverse saturation current and the forward current increase when a small amount of transport through pinholes is introduced, and 3) finally a linear Ohmic behavior is observed when the pinhole transport component reaches a certain level. Furthermore, the simulation for whole TOPCon solar cells provides some useful results. For very thin SiO<sub>x</sub> (< 1.2 nm), the tunneling provides sufficient high tunneling probability and high efficiency TOPCon solar cells can be obtained without transport through pinholes if the passivation is ensured; while for a relatively thick SiO<sub>x</sub> (> 1.2 nm) without the transport through pinholes, the TOPCon solar cell shows a poor fill factor (FF) with a high series resistance (Rs) because the tunneling does not provide a sufficient high transport channel for carrier transport, and the introduction of a small number of transports through pinholes improves the FF and reduces the Rs, hence improves the PCE. However, a high possibility for carrier going through pinholes reduces all of the performance parameters and degrades PCE for all the cases simulated. Therefore, an optimized pinhole density and size distribution is critical engineering for solar cell performance optimization. However, the establishment of an optimized method to precisely control the pinhole formation and characterization is still on the way.","Elsevier","","National Renewable Energy Lab.

Solar plus can increase on-site PV use. The literature shows that these values justify the incremental costs of solar plus devices for a wide variety of technologies, geographies, and customer load profiles, especially for customers in three rate structure contexts: where PV is sold to the grid at a lower value than the customer's retail rate, in time-of-use rates where peak periods do not coincide with PV output, and in demand charge rates where load peaks do not coincide with PV output. Rate structure and policy reform may be necessary to ensure that increasing solar plus deployment provides both end-user and system-level benefits.","Elsevier","","National Renewable Energy Lab.

Surface manipulation of metal halide perovskite (MHP) QDs has proven particularly challenging in comparison to that of more established inorganic materials due to dynamic surface species and low material formation energy; most conventional methods of chemical manipulation targeted at the MHP QD surface will result in transformation or dissolution of the MHP crystal. In previous work, we have demonstrated record-efficiency QD solar cells (QDSCs) based on ligand-exchange procedures that electronically couple MHP QDs yet maintain their nanocrystalline size, which stabilizes the corner-sharing structure of the constituent PbI64-octahedra with optoelectronic properties optimal for solar energy conversion. In this work, we employ a variety of spectroscopic techniques to develop a molecular-level understanding of the MHP QD surface chemistry in this system. We individually target both the anionic (oleate) and cationic (oleylammonium) ligands. We find that atmospheric moisture aids the process by hydrolysis of methyl acetate to generate acetic acid and methanol. Acetic acid then replaces native oleate ligands to yield QD surface-bound acetate and free oleic acid. The native oleylammonium ligands remain throughout this film deposition process and are exchanged during a final treatment step employing smaller cations - namely, formamidinium. This final treatment has a narrow processing window; initial treatment at this stage leads to a more strongly coupled QD regime followed by transformation into a bulk MHP film after longer treatment. These insights provide chemical understanding to the deposition of high-quality, electronically coupled MHP QD films that maintain both quantum confinement and their crystalline phase and attain high photovoltaic performance.","American Chemical Society (ACS)","","Energy Frontier Research Centers (EFRC) (United States).

Time-of-flight secondary-ion mass spectrometry (TOF-SIMS) is one of the few techniques that can obtain chemical information from all components of hybrid organic-inorganic perovskite photovoltaics in one dimension (standard depth profiling), two dimensions (high-resolution 100-nm imaging), as well as three dimensions (tomography combining high-resolution imaging with depth profiling). TOF-SIMS has been used to analyze perovskite photovoltaics made by a variety of methods, and the breadth of insight that can be gained from the technique is illustrated here including: cation uniformity (depth and lateral), changes in chemistry upon alternate processing, changes in chemistry upon degradation, and lateral distribution of additives that passivate grain boundaries. Using TOF-SIMS on multiple perovskite compositions, we show information regarding hybrid perovskite formation as well as inhomogeneity critical to device performance can be extracted providing one of the best proxies for understanding compositional changes resulting from degradation.

Luminescent solar concentrators (LSCs) harness light generated by luminophores embedded in a light-trapping waveguide to concentrate onto smaller cells. LSCs can absorb both direct and diffuse sunlight, and thus can operate as flat plate receivers at a fixed tilt and with a conventional module form factor. However, current LSCs experience significant power loss through parasitic luminophore absorption and incomplete light trapping by the optical waveguide. Here, we introduce a tandem LSC device architecture that overcomes both of these limitations, consisting of a poly(lauryl methacrylate) polymer layer with embedded cadmium selenide core, cadmium sulfide shell (CdSe/CdS) quantum dot (QD) luminophores and an InGaP microcell array, which serves as high bandgap absorbers on the top of a conventional Si photovoltaic. We investigate the design space for a tandem LSC, using experimentally measured performance parameters for key components, including the InGaP microcell array, CdSe/CdS QDs, and spectrally selective waveguide filters. Using a Monte Carlo ray-tracing model, we compute the power conversion efficiency for a tandem LSC module with these components to be 29.4% under partially diffuse illumination conditions. These results indicate that a tandem LSC-on-Si architecture could significantly improve upon the efficiency of a conventional Si photovoltaic cell.","IEEE","","National Renewable Energy Lab.

While many III-V/Si photovoltaic integration approaches have been studied, epitaxial growth on Si allows for fewer processing steps compared to other approaches. However, current epitaxial pathways utilize expensive techniques, such as thermal cycle annealing or thick buffer layers to control defect densities, undermining the low-cost goal of integrating III-Vs with Si. Here, we present single-junction GaAs solar cells grown directly on Si using selective area growth as an alternative low-cost technique to control material quality with a much thinner buffer. We demonstrate a 10.4%-efficient GaAs device grown on a V-grooved Si substrate, which achieved an antiphase domain-free III-V/Si interface and a threading dislocation density of 2 x 107 cm-2, despite the lack of a graded buffer. We compare this growth on V-grooved Si to solar cells grown on polished Si with and without a patterned silica buffer layer, which demonstrate efficiencies of 6.5% and 6.8%, respectively; the polished Si was patterned using nanoimprint lithography, which is a low-cost patterning technique compatible with III-V selective area growth. Cracking is found to be a critical challenge that hinders solar cell performance and is exacerbated by the V-grooved Si surface topography. The results in this paper provide a promising pathway toward high-efficiency, low-cost III-V/Si tandem photovoltaics.","IEEE","","National Renewable Energy Lab.

The optical performance of a concentrating solar power collector represents the largest loss in the efficiency of the overall system. The ability to accurately model the complex optical interactions of a collector becomes essential in successfully implementing a new collector technology. Here, this study presents a detailed sensitivity analysis of the optical performance of Hyperlight linear Fresnel technology, characterizing the effects of potential optomechanical error sources on collector performance. Optical models are implemented in SolTrace, a Monte-Carlo ray-tracing software developed at NREL. First, SolTrace is used to analyze collector sensitivity to individual optomechanical error perturbations in both the primary reflectors and the receiver assembly. Then, a high-fidelity optomechanical error model is adopted to capture the realistic performance of the installed Hyperlight linear Fresnel collector.

A challenge that must first be addressed, however, is the development of a predictive reliability model that captures the synergy of terrestrial stressors on module degradation, particularly at encapsulant interfaces. Using a metrology designed specifically for PV modules, a comprehensive study of the widely used ethylene vinyl acetate encapsulant was performed in which encapsulant adhesion was evaluated as a function of environmental stressors (UV exposure, temperature, and humidity) for modules aged both under accelerated lab and internationally located field conditions for months to nearly 3 decades. Mechanical and chemical characterization methods are combined with fundamental polymer reaction engineering to unravel the degradation processes active at the molecular scale that lead to encapsulant delamination. An analytical and modular model framework is put forward enabling the prediction of long-term PV module durability, starting from fundamental principles at the molecular level and explicitly accounting for bond rupture events in the bulk encapsulant and at the encapsulant interfaces. Successful parameter tuning to adhesion data indicates a dominant occurrence of deacetylation, β-scission, and hydrolytic depolymerization, respectively. The model contributes to the longstanding challenge of predicting module lifetimes in any geographic location while minimizing time-consuming and costly aging studies.","Wiley","","National Renewable Energy Lab.

Bragg reflectors consist of several microns of alternating layers with refractive index contrast and provide a useful internal reflection to multijunction solar cells with optically thin subcells. In this work, we implement distributed Bragg reflectors within the compositionally graded buffers of inverted metamorphic solar cells to add functionality to the buffer. The reflectance of this AlGaInAs 'graded buffer Bragg reflector' is very similar to the reflectance of a similar AlGaAs Bragg reflector external to a buffer as well as the reflectance predicted by the transfer matrix model, indicating that the roughness of the buffer does not drastically reduce the reflection. Reflectance of 72%, 91%, and 98% is achieved in 2, 4, and 8 um buffers using AlGaInAs layers that alternate between 30% and 70% aluminum content. Using a 2 um graded buffer Bragg reflector, the 1.0-eV mismatched subcell of a GaAs/GaInAs tandem has a minor increase in threading dislocation density compared to a standard graded buffer and a small, 20 mV, loss in voltage. As the buffer is thickened, the voltage loss is recuperated and excellent subcell voltages are achieved, indicating that the Bragg reflector is not severely hindering dislocation glide. We demonstrate that the benefits of the graded buffer Bragg reflector for optically thin subcells and subcells containing quantum wells, and conclude that Bragg reflectors can effectively be implemented within graded buffers, adding functionality without adding cost.","IEEE","","National Renewable Energy Lab.

Here, polycrystalline Al<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub>/CdSeTe/Al<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub>/glass heterostructures are grown, and a combination of spectroscopic, microscopic, and time-resolved electro-optical measurements demonstrates that the interface recombination velocity at alumina/thin-film interfaces can be less than 100 cm/s.

Different with VRE techniques, concentrating solar power (CSP) is an appealing renewable generation technology due to its dispatch ability through the use of thermal energy storage and is thus expected to play a significant role in high renewable energy penetrated power systems. In this paper, we propose a look-ahead stochastic unit commitment model to operate power systems with CSP under high renewable energy penetration. It has a three-stage structure. The first stage optimizes the operational decisions in a day-ahead framework based on forecasts; the second stage minimizes the expected generation cost for possible realizations in the real time; and the third stage accounts for look-ahead operation in future operating days.

The devices not only exhibit low resistance, they are also thermally stable, capable of sustaining postdeposition temperatures up to 600 degrees C. This is a key requirement for many high performance multijunction thin film inorganic solar cells. The CuAlO<sub>2</sub> top-layer remains amorphous, providing a diffusion barrier for top cell stack processing. The materials' stack gives a negligible voltage drop, and the visible-spectrum transparency is near 100%. XPS measurements show that unannealed Cu in the Cu-Al-O films is in the +2 oxidation state, while in the films annealed at 500 degrees C and above, Cu is in the +1 oxidation state. This suggests that annealing is necessary to form CuAlO<sub>2</sub>. A near-broken gap alignment provides a low resistance contact with band alignment that is nearly ideal for a tandem device.","American Vacuum Society","","National Renewable Energy Lab.

"SolarPILOT: A power tower solar field layout and characterization tool","Wagner, Michael J.; Wendelin, Tim","14 SOLAR ENERGY; 47 OTHER INSTRUMENTATION; SolarPILOT; power tower; heliostat layout; pptical characterization; simulation optimization","This paper develops and demonstrates a new SolarPower tower Integrated Layout and Optimization Tool (SolarPILOT). The tool uses the analytical flux image Hermite series approximation originally implemented in the DELSOL3 software developed by Sandia National Laboratory in the early 1980s. By applying the analytical model to individual heliostat images rather than large groups or zones of heliostats, SolarPILOT can characterize a wide variety of heliostat field layouts. The individual heliostat modeling approach increases computational expense in comparison with DELSOL3, so SolarPILOT implements a number of improvements to the analytical approximation method to improve model accuracy and computational efficiency. This paper discusses several of these methods, including dynamic heliostat grouping to reduce the expense of intercept factor evaluation, approximation of annual productivity with a subset of time steps throughout the year, polygon clipping to accurately calculate inter-heliostat shadowing and blocking, receiver and tower geometry optimization, and a trigonometric image transformation technique that ensures model accuracy for small heliostats. SolarPILOT also integrates a Monte-Carlo ray tracing engine (SolTrace), providing improved receiver optical modeling capability, a user-friendly front end for geometry definition, and side-by-side validation of the analytical algorithms.","Elsevier","","National Renewable Energy Lab.

To understand these potential futures, we model Florida Reliability Coordinating Council operations in 2026 over a wide range of PV penetrations with various combinations of battery storage capacity, demand response, and increased operational flexibility. By calculating the value of PV under a wide range of conditions, we find that at least 5%, and more likely 10-24%, PV penetration is cost competitive in Florida within the next decade with baseline flexibility and all but the most pessimistic of assumptions. For high PV penetrations, we demonstrate Florida's electrical net-load variability (duck curve) challenges, the associated reduction of PV's value to the system, and the ability of flexibility options-in particular energy-shifting resources-to preserve value and increase the economic carrying capacity of PV. A high level of demand response boosts the economic carrying capacity of PV by up to 0.5-2 percentage points, which is comparable to the impact of deploying 1 GW of battery storage. Adding 4 GW of battery storage expands the economic carrying capacity of PV by up to 6 percentage points.","Elsevier","","National Renewable Energy Lab.

However, any technology targeting large-scale deployment must eventually pass industry-standard qualification tests and undergo reliability testing to validate the module lifetime. In this Perspective, we review the methodologies used to assess the reliability of established photovoltaics technologies and to develop standardized qualification tests. We present the stress factors and stress levels for degradation mechanisms currently identified in pre-commercial perovskite devices, along with engineering concepts for mitigation of those degradation modes. Recommendations for complete and transparent reporting of stability tests are given, to facilitate future inter-laboratory comparisons and to further the understanding of field-relevant degradation mechanisms, which will benefit the development of accelerated stress tests.","Nature Publishing Group","","National Renewable Energy Lab.

It accounts for the spectral properties of the subcells as well as their reduced operating temperature due to increased efficiency and luminescent coupling. Inputs are the experimental I-V and QE data of the subcells (e.g., available from laboratory prototypes) and the irradiance-dependent module temperature of the bottom cell. We apply the model to compare two types of tandem cells, GaInP and GaAs top cells on Si bottom cells. The impact of the temperature model, compared to a constant temperature, shows a relative change in energy yield of up to 2.7%<sub>rel</sub>. Including luminescent coupling for GaAs/Si devices with two terminals, increases the energy yield by 34.0%<sub>rel</sub>. This is still 34.2%<sub>rel</sub> less energy yielded than for GaInP/Si two-terminal devices. The performance of the GaInP/Si devices can be improved by 5.8%<sub>rel</sub> using three-terminal devices with back-contacted bottom cells instead of a two-terminal configuration under the assumption of a cell string with voltage matching of one top cell with two bottom cells.

The rapid expansion of this emerging industry prompts questions about the installation industry's market structure, such as how market shares are distributed among installers and how interinstaller competition affects PV deployment. This article leverages a rich dataset to describe trends in the evolution of the US residential PV installation industry. The data show that most residential PV installers are relatively small companies, with about half of installers installing fewer than 5 systems. At the same time, a subset of high-volume installers have accumulated market share, especially from 2010 to 2016. Furthermore causes of this recent market concentration are explored, with an emphasis on the role of the emergence of alternative customer financing options in the United States.","Wiley","","National Renewable Energy Lab.

Electroluminescence measurements show that the individual V<sub>OC</sub> of the top and bottom cell are 1.40 and 1.00 V, respectively, yielding EG-voltage offsets (W<sub>OC</sub>) of 0.48 and 0.41 V.

Temperature-and illumination-dependent device measurements are used to track interface recombination and recombination in the quasi-neutral region. The analysis of these data reveals that the benefit of alkali PDTs depends on the substrate: interface recombination is reduced in devices grown on sapphire substrates, whereas recombination in the quasi-neutral regions is reduced in devices grown on SLG substrates. Cathodoluminescence (CL) spectrum imaging is used to study the spatial distribution of recombination with respect to the grain structure. The grain-boundary CL contrast is similar in films with no PDT, NaF PDT, or KF PDT. A reduced grain-boundary contrast is observed with a NaF + KF PDT; however, suggesting a reduced recombination strength at the grain boundaries (GBs) for combined NaF + KF treatment. CL spectra indicate band tailing, consistent with the fluctuating potential model. Fluctuating potentials are believed to reduce open-circuit voltage, but their spatial distribution has not been studied. Here, CL spectrum imaging data are used to generate maps of the root-mean-square value of the potential energy fluctuations-γ. These maps reveal a bimodal ..gamma.. distribution for all samples: ..gamma.. is generally in the range ~15-50 meV or ~100-180 meV. The higher ..gamma.. range is more significantly affected by the PDTs; after the PDTs, it is strongly correlated with GBs. The lower ..gamma.. range is correlated with higher emission intensity regions, typically grain interiors, and increases in area fraction after the PDTs. These results demonstrate how spatially resolved luminescence and device characterization measurements can be used to monitor changes in recombination in CIGS films and photovoltaic devices. Such measurements can complement empirical device optimization and help improve device performance.","IEEE","","National Renewable Energy Lab.

Solar cells have been fabricated with intentional K introduction into specific regions of the device including the CuInSe<sub>2</sub>/CdS interface (CuInSe<sub>2</sub>/KInSe<sub>2</sub>/CdS) and the grain interiors (Cu<sub>0.93</sub>K<sub>0.07</sub>InSe<sub>2</sub>/CdS).

The distribution of all elements within these samples has been directly observed with sub–nm resolution via atom probe tomography. In addition, electron beam–induced current measurements have been performed to correlate the atom probe tomography compositional profiles to the nanoscale carrier collection properties. The experiments show that a large decrease in the Cu/In ratio at the CdS interface can be achieved by forming KInSe<sub>2</sub> at the absorber surface, which drastically improves the device efficiency. The results presented here show a direct link between K concentration, Cu depletion, and In accumulation, such that the Cu/In ratio significantly reduces with K incorporation.

The solar industry has been developing antireflection (AR) and antisoiling (AS) surface coatings to enhance light transmittance and mitigate the impacts of soiling. Although uncoated glass has been field tested for decades, minimal data exist to demonstrate the durability of AR and AS coatings against abrasion and surface erosion, including from: natural weathering, airborne sand, and industry cleaning practices. Coupons 75 mm square of varying types have been field-deployed to gather long-term data on coating durability; the initial results are presented here after 1 year of outdoor exposure near Sacramento, California. Duplicate sets of coupons were cleaned monthly per four different cleaning practices. All coupons demonstrated inorganic soiling as well as microscale biological contamination, regardless of cleaning method. Additionally, full-sized, field-aged modules from other areas of the world presented with similar types of contamination as the field-aged coupons; micrographs and results from genomic sequencing of this contamination are included here. Optical microscopy, scanning electron microscopy, atomic force microscopy/energy-dispersive spectroscopy, surface roughness, transmittance, and surface energy analysis of representative specimens and cleaning practices are presented.","Elsevier","","National Renewable Energy Lab.

"Elucidating potential-induced degradation in bifacial PERC silicon photovoltaic modules","Luo, Wei; Hacke, Peter; Terwilliger, Kent; Liang, Tian Shen; Wang, Yan; Ramakrishna, Seeram; Aberle, Armin G.; Khoo, Yong Sheng","14 SOLAR ENERGY; 36 MATERIALS SCIENCE; photovoltaic module reliability; potential-induced degradation; surface passivation degradation; bifacial PERC silicon solar cell; light-induced recovery","This paper elucidates the behavior and underlying mechanism of potential-induced degradation (PID) on the rear side of p-type monocrystalline silicon bifacial passivated emitter and rear cell (PERC) photovoltaic modules. At 50 degrees C, 30% relative humidity, and -1000 V bias to the solar cells with aluminium foil on the rear glass surface, the rear-side performance of bifacial PERC modules at standard testing conditions degraded dramatically after 40 hours with a 40.4%, 36.2%, and 7.2% loss in maximum power (Pmpp), short-circuit current (Isc), and open-circuit voltage (Voc), respectively. The front-side standard testing condition performance, on the other hand, showed less degradation; Pmpp, Isc, and Voc dropped by 12.0%, 5.2%, and 5.3%, respectively. However, negligible degradation was observed when the solar cells were positively biased. Based on I-V characteristics, electroluminescence, external quantum efficiency measurements, and the effective minority-carrier lifetime simulation, the efficiency loss is shown to be caused by the surface polarization effect; positive charges are attracted to the passivation/antireflection stack on the rear surface and reduce its field effect passivation performance. Extended PID testing to 100 hours showed an increase in device performances (relative to 40 hours) due to the formation of an inversion layer along the rear surface. In addition, replacing ethylene-vinyl acetate copolymer with polyolefin elastomer films significantly slows down the progression of PID, whereas a glass/transparent backsheet design effectively protects the rear side of bifacial PERC modules from PID. Furthermore, PID on the rear side of bifacial PERC modules is fully recoverable, and light greatly promotes recovery of the observed PID.","Wiley","","National Renewable Energy Lab.

Phase-pure CZTSe and CZTS were obtained after annealing at 500 degrees C for 1 min in Se (selenization) and 600 degrees C for 10 min in S (sulfurization) atmospheres, respectively. CZTSSe solid solutions are synthesized by the sequential annealing of metal precursors in S and Se atmosphere separately or in the mixed (S + Se) atmosphere. In the S-rich mixed atmosphere, S-rich CZTSSe solid solution is formed at all annealing conditions. Surprisingly, in a Se-rich mixed atmosphere, longer annealing at 600 degrees C yields S-rich CZTSSe. The CZTSSe film formed by annealing in near equimolar S/Se atmosphere exhibits a compositional gradient across the thickness. Furthermore, these results suggest that the crystallinity, composition, and hence the bandgap of CZTSSe can be precisely controlled by the proper choice of annealing temperature, duration, and atmosphere.","American Chemical Society (ACS)","","National Renewable Energy Lab.

Silicone encapsulant specimens were artificially weathered under narrow band UV filters to determine the effects of individual wavelengths within the UV spectrum on the photodegradation of the cohesion of encapsulant material and its adhesion with adjacent interfaces. The threshold wavelength, signifying the upper bound of the damaging action spectrum for the silicone, was identified from the results. In addition, specimens were artificially weathered with different relative humidities to understand the effects of moisture on the rate of photodegradation. The adhesion energy was measured using a fracture mechanics approach. The complementary delaminated surfaces were characterized to determine the failure pathway and chemistry changes resulting from photodegradation. A previously developed model was modified to account for the effects of damaging wavelengths in the terrestrial solar spectrum and reciprocity law failure due to varying UV intensity during weathering. With these modifications, the model showed good agreement with the behavior of the silicone encapsulant exposed in an outdoor solar concentrator simulating concentrator photovoltaics operating conditions. Similar studies can be adopted to develop models that can have high predictive accuracies based on accelerated aging studies.","Elsevier","","National Renewable Energy Lab.

Herein, the tetraethylorthosilicate hydrolysis process is integrated with the solution crystallization of FA-based perovskites, forming a new film structure with individual perovskite grains encapsulated by amorphous silica layers that are in situ formed at the nanoscale. The silica not only protects perovskite grains from the degradation but also enhances the charge-carrier dynamics of perovskite films. The underlying mechanism is discussed using a joint experiment-theory approach. Through this in situ grain encapsulation method, PSCs show an efficiency close to 20% with an impressive 97% retention after 1000-h storage under ambient conditions.","Wiley","","National Renewable Energy Lab.

High-dimensional remote sensing data products depend on cloud cover variability, atmosphere aerosol levels, and other atmospheric parameters. Because of weather fronts and aerosols, it is difficult to quantify solar power variability based on distributed solar networks. The global horizontal irradiance (GHI) component in the National Solar Radiation Database (NSRDB) is available at a 30-min time resolution. The algorithm proposed in this paper produces 1-min-resolution GHI samples at locations where NSRDB data are available. The synthetic irradiance datasets are produced using log-additive non-Gaussian mixture models and resampling techniques. The model is trained over historical data, and predicted values are compared with in situ data. This approach allows for estimating the solar irradiance at subhourly temporal resolutions, while featuring variability for locations where measurements are otherwise not available.","IEEE","","National Renewable Energy Lab.

"Examining the Potential for Agricultural Benefits from Pollinator Habitat at Solar Facilities in the United States","Walston, Leroy J.; Mishra, Shruti K.; Hartmann, Heidi M.; Hlohowskyj, Ihor; McCall, James; Macknick, Jordan","14 SOLAR ENERGY; 29 ENERGY PLANNING, POLICY, AND ECONOMY; renewable energy; pollinators; agriculture; ecosystem services; solar energy; co-location; agrivoltaics","Of the many roles insects serve for ecosystem function, pollination is possibly the most important service directly linked to human well-being. However, land use changes have contributed to the decline of pollinators and their habitats. In agricultural landscapes that also support renewable energy developments such as utility-scale solar energy [USSE] facilities, opportunities may exist to conserve insect pollinators and locally restore their ecosystem services through the implementation of vegetation management approaches that aim to provide and maintain pollinator habitat at USSE facilities. As a first step toward understanding the potential agricultural benefits of solar-pollinator habitat, we identified areas of overlap between USSE facilities and surrounding pollinator-dependent crop types in the United States (U.S.). Using spatial data on solar energy developments and crop types across the U.S., and assuming a pollinator foraging distance of 1.5 km, we identified over 3,500 km2 of agricultural land near existing and planned USSE facilities that may benefit from increased pollination services through the creation of pollinator habitat at the USSE facilities. The following five pollinator-dependent crop types accounted for over 90% of the agriculture near USSE facilities, and these could benefit most from the creation of pollinator habitat at existing and planned USSE facilities: soybeans, alfalfa, cotton, almonds, and citrus. We discuss how our results may be used to understand potential agro-economic implications of solar-pollinator habitat. Our results show that ecosystem service restoration through the creation of pollinator habitat could improve the sustainability of large-scale renewable energy developments in agricultural landscapes.","American Chemical Society","","National Renewable Energy Lab.

Our results show that for both n- and p-type contacts, there is an optimum SiO<sub><em>x</em></sub> thickness of 1.4-1.6 nm for obtaining the highest implied open-circuit voltage (<em>i-V</em><sub><em>oc</em></sub>) values of ~739 and ~700 mV, respectively. For contacts with SiO<sub><em>x</em></sub> thicker than 1.6 nm, the i-V<sub><em>oc</em></sub> drops due to reduced field-effect passivation. We attribute this to the fact that a thicker SiO<sub><em>x</em></sub> layer hinders the diffusion of both n- and p-type dopants into the c-Si wafer resulting in a junction that is very close to the <em>c</em>-Si/SiO<sub><em>x</em></sub> interface, which increases carrier recombination most likely due to the presence of defects at this interface. The resistivity measured through the metal/poly-Si/SiO<sub><em>x</em></sub>/<em>c</em>-Si stack is independent of SiO<sub>x</sub> thickness up to 1.6 nm, and increases exponentially by several orders of magnitude with further increase in SiO<sub><em>x</em></sub> thickness due to inefficient tunneling transport. Finally, the extent of metallization-induced degradation of the poly-Si/SiO<sub><em>x</em></sub>/<em>c</em>-Si contacts is worst for the thinnest SiO<sub><em>x</em></sub> investigated (~1 nm), and interestingly it is not completely mitigated even for a ~3 nm thick SiO<sub><em>x</em></sub>.","Elsevier","","National Renewable Energy Lab.

Samples with conventional soda-lime glass (SLG) and low-alkaline glass (borosilicate glass, BSG) were analyzed applying positive and negative 1000 V bias at 85 degrees C and low relative humidity after a heat-soaking phase. During the heat-soaking phase, BSG samples showed degradation, with variations in their dark current-voltage (I-V) curve parameters compared with the stability of SLG samples. During the PID stress phase, back-grounded SLG samples with -1000 V applied to the cell experienced fast degradation, with complete failure in 25 h, whereas, BSG samples only showed changes because of the dark heat environment. When grounded on their front face, SLG samples remained stable during more than 150 h of PID testing, beginning degradation after longer applications of stress. The analysis of the dark I-V curves of SLG samples through the single-diode model showed that an increase in saturation current J<sub>0</sub> occurs first, attributed to Na<sup>+</sup> ions migrating into the CdS/ZnO layer; later, a decrease in shunt resistance occurs. Lastly, the application of the model in BSG samples showed an increase in series resistance evaluated at 25 degrees C.

Here we employ transient absorption microscopy (TAM) to directly measure carrier transport within and across the boundaries in hybrid organic-inorganic perovskite thin films for solar cell applications with 50 nm spatial precision and 300 fs temporal resolution. By selectively imaging sub-bandgap states, our results show that lateral carrier transport is slowed down by these states at the grain boundaries. However, the long carrier lifetimes allow for efficient transport across the grain boundaries. The carrier diffusion constant is reduced by about a factor of 2 for micron-sized grain samples by the grain boundaries. For grain sizes on the order of ~200 nm, carrier transport over multiple grains has been observed within a time window of 5 ns. These observations explain both the shortened photoluminescence lifetimes at the boundaries as well as the seemingly benign nature of the grain boundaries in carrier generation.","American Chemical Society (ACS)","","National Renewable Energy Lab.

Optical models are implemented in SolTrace, which is ray-tracing software developed at the National Renewable Energy Laboratory. The ray-tracing algorithm is used to calculate a collector's design-point performance as well as its incidence-angle modifiers to evaluate the collector performance at any sun position during a typical meteorological year. The efficiency over a one-year period is then analyzed based on ray-tracing results. Using China Lake (California) as an example, the annual optical efficiency is 60% for the selected parabolic trough collector, 52% for the selected central-receiver technology, and 40% for the selected linear Fresnel collector. The parabolic trough has the highest optical performance among all. The selected central-receiver technology provides the most consistent seasonal production profile over the course of the year due to its two-axis-tracking ability but would suffer most from the increasing solar collector optical error. It is also shown that a dramatic cost reduction is required for the selected linear Fresnel technology to be competitive in the future energy market. Sensitivity of three CSP technologies to the deployment locations and the overall optical-error magnitude is also examined through annual performance analysis. The results will provide insights into a better understanding on inherent technical aspects of different CSP technologies.","Elsevier","","National Renewable Energy Lab.

CdTe alloys can be tuned with magnesium (CdMgTe) or zinc (CdZnTe) for ideal tandem pairing with silicon. A II-VI/Si tandem holds the greatest promise for inexpensive, high-efficiency top cells that can be quickly deployed in the market using existing polycrystalline CdTe manufacturing lines combined with mature silicon production lines. Currently, all high efficiency polycrystalline CdTe cells require a chloride-based passivation process to passivate grain boundaries and bulk defects. This research examines the rich chemistry and physics that has historically limited performance when extending Cl treatments to polycrystalline 1.7-eV CdMgTe and CdZnTe absorbers. A combination of transmittance, quantum efficiency, photoluminescence, transmission electron microscopy, and energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy clearly reveals that during passivation, Mg segregates and out-diffuses, initially at the grain boundaries but eventually throughout the bulk. CdZnTe exhibits similar Zn segregation behavior; however, the onset and progression is localized to the back of the device. After passivation, CdMgTe and CdZnTe can render a layer that is reduced to predominantly CdTe electro-optical behavior. Furthermore, contact instabilities caused by inter-diffusion between the layers create additional complications. The results outline critical issues and paths for these materials to be successfully implemented in Si-based tandems and other applications.","American Institute of Physics (AIP)","","National Renewable Energy Lab.

For physical vapor deposition (PVD), these methods include combinatorial sputtering with intentional gradients of metal/metalloid composition, temperature, and thickness across the substrate. However, many other synthesis parameters still remain out of reach for combinatorial methods. Here, we extend combinatorial sputtering parameters to include gradients of gaseous elements in thin films. Specifically, a nitrogen gradient was generated in a thin film sample library by placing two MnTe sputtering sources with different gas flows (Ar and Ar/N<sub>2</sub>) opposite of one another during the synthesis. The nitrogen content gradient was measured along the sample surface, correlating with the distance from the nitrogen source. The phase, composition, and optoelectronic properties of the resulting thin films change as a function of the nitrogen content. Furthermore, this work shows that gradients of gaseous elements can be generated in thin films synthesized by sputtering, expanding the boundaries of combinatorial science.","American Chemical Society (ACS)","","Energy Frontier Research Centers (EFRC) (United States).

This study investigates the impact of illumination on the polarization-type PID (PID-p) on two different types of encapsulated (glass/backsheet) crystalline silicon solar cells: 1) n-type bifacial passivated emitter rear totally diffused (the front side is facing glass and PID-stressed); and 2) p-type bifacial passivated emitter and rear cell (the rear side is facing glass and PID-stressed). The samples are stressed under the conditions of -1000 V, 40 degrees C, and 40% relative humidity and at different irradiance levels (xenon lamps). While the type-A modules show no reduction in PID-p sensitivity under illumination up to 800 W/m<sup>2</sup>, PID-p in the type-B modules is arrested by the light at an irradiance level as low as 10 W/m<sup>2</sup>. Furthermore, PID-degraded type-B modules (degradation induced in the dark) exhibit a rapid recovery (full recovery in 20 min) upon exposure to light (40 W/m<sup>2</sup>).

"A Physics-based Smart Persistence model for Intra-hour forecasting of solar radiation (PSPI) using GHI measurements and a cloud retrieval technique","Kumler, Andrew; Xie, Yu; Zhang, Yingchen","14 SOLAR ENERGY; 47 OTHER INSTRUMENTATION; PSPI; global horizontal irradiance; GHI; solar radiation; solar zenith angle","Short-term solar forecasting models based solely on global horizontal irradiance (GHI) measurements are often unable to discriminate the forecasting of the factors affecting GHI from those that can be precisely computed by atmospheric models. Here, we introduce a Physics-based Smart Persistence model for Intra-hour forecasting of solar radiation (PSPI) that decomposes the forecasting of GHI into the computation of extraterrestrial solar radiation and solar zenith angle and the forecasting of cloud albedo and cloud fraction. The extraterrestrial solar radiation and solar zenith angle are accurately computed by the Solar Position Algorithm (SPA) developed at the National Renewable Energy Laboratory (NREL). A cloud retrieval technique is used to estimate cloud albedo and cloud fraction from surface-based observations of GHI. With the assumption of persistent cloud structures, the cloud albedo and cloud fraction are predicted for future time steps using a two-stream approximation and a 5-min exponential weighted moving average, respectively. Our model evaluation using the long-term observations of GHI at NREL's Solar Radiation Research Laboratory (SRRL) shows that the PSPI has a better performance than the persistence and smart persistence models in all forecast time horizons between 5 and 60 min, which is more significant in cloudy-sky conditions. Finally, compared to the persistence and smart persistence models, the PSPI does not require additional observations of various atmospheric parameters but is customizable in that additional observations, if available, can be ingested to further improve the GHI forecast. An advanced technology of cloud forecast is also expected to improve the future performance of the PSPI.","Elsevier","","National Renewable Energy Lab.

First, the effect of distributing K throughout bulk Cu<sub>1-x</sub>K<sub>x</sub>InSe<sub>2</sub> absorbers at low K/(K+Cu) compositions (0 = x = 0.30) was studied. Efficiency, open-circuit voltage (VOC), and fill factor (FF) were greatly enhanced for x ~ 0.07, resulting in an officially-measured 15.0%-efficient solar cell, matching the world record CuInSe<sub>2</sub> efficiency. The improvements were a result of reduced interface and bulk recombination, relative to CuInSe<sub>2</sub> (x ~ 0). However, higher x compositions had reduced efficiency, short-circuit current density (J<sub>SC</sub>), and FF due to greatly increased interface recombination, relative to the x ~ 0 baseline. Next, the effect of confining K at the absorber/buffer interface at high K/(K+Cu) compositions (0.30 = x = 0.92) was researched. Previous work showed that these surface layer growth conditions produced CuInSe<sub>2</sub> with a large phase fraction of KInSe<sub>2</sub>. After optimization (75 nm surface layer with x ~ 0.41), these KInSe<sub>2</sub> surface samples exhibited increased efficiency (officially 14.9%), VOC, and FF as a result of decreased interface recombination. The KInSe<sub>2</sub> surfaces had features similar to previous reports for KF post-deposition treatments (PDTs) used in world record CIGS solar cells - taken as indirect evidence that KInSe<sub>2</sub> can form during these PDTs. Both the bulk and surface growth processes greatly reduced interface recombination. However, the KInSe<sub>2</sub> surface had higher K levels near the surface, greater lifetimes, and increased inversion near the buffer interface, relative to the champion bulk Cu<sub>1-x</sub>K<sub>x</sub>InSe<sub>2</sub> absorber. These characteristics demonstrate that K may benefit PV performance by different mechanisms at the surface and in the absorber bulk.","Elsevier","","National Renewable Energy Lab.

This Perspective lays out why this notion is especially applicable for solar cells based on metal halide perovskite (MHP) absorber materials, for which we reach a significant improvement of device functionality and stability through the means of engineering the energetics and electronic properties at the interface. After examining recent key developments in chemical and electronic structure characterization of MHPs that led to this avenue, we will iterate the next steps toward interlayer tailoring and analysis. The future goal is to derive a comprehensive model for interface energetics in perovskite solar cells and to set up respective design rules for stable high-efficiency cells. This approach also pertains to the broader scope of MHP-based optoelectronic devices for which charge carrier transport across the interfaces and surface recombination play a major role.","American Chemical Society (ACS)","","National Renewable Energy Lab.

The CIGS thin films deposited at different substrate temperatures were synthesized on soda-lime glass (SLG) substrates using a single quaternary CIGS target. The film composition ratios of ([Cu]/[In]+[Ga]), ([Ga]/[In]+[Ga]), and ([Se]/[Cu]+[In]+[Ga]) were almost consistent with those of the sputtering target. X-ray diffraction (XRD) and Raman results showed that the crystallinity of the CIGS thin films was gradually improved as substrate temperatures increased. Transmission electron microscopy (TEM) showed that the films grown at 600 degrees C have a columnar structure with the grain size of ~100 nm. In addition, for the CIGS films grown at 600 degrees C, TEM-EDX analysis revealed that the synchronized fluctuation of the Cu and Se signals was observed in the direction of the film depth, while the In and Ga signals were constant. As a result, the CIGS solar cell made using the film showed a degraded cell efficiency of 2.5%, which might be have been caused by not only Cu-rich and Se-poor compositions but the locally unstable composition in the CIGS films fabricated by one-step sputtering.","Elsevier","","National Renewable Energy Lab.

Using high-temperature X-ray diffraction, resonant ultrasound spectroscopy, and transport properties, we uncover the critical role of the antisite defects HgCu and CuHg on phonon transport within the Hg-containing systems. Despite the differences in chemistry between Hg and Cu, the high concentration of these antisite defects emerges from the energetic proximity of the kesterite and stannite cation motifs. Our phonon calculations reveal that heavier group IIB elements not only introduce low-lying optical modes, but the subsequent antisite defects also possess unusually strong point defect phonon scattering power. The scattering strength stems from the fundamentally different vibrational modes supported by the constituent elements (e.g., Hg and Cu). Despite the significant impact on the thermal properties, antisite defects do not negatively impact the mobility (>50 cm2/(Vs) at 300 degrees C) in Hg-containing systems, leading to predicted zT > 1.5 in Cu2HgGeTe4 and Cu2HgSnTe4 under optimized doping. In addition to introducing a potentially new p-type thermoelectric material, this work provides (1) a strategy to use the proximity of phase transitions to increase point defect phonon scattering, and (2) a means to quantify the power of a given point defect through inexpensive phonon calculations.","American Chemical Society (ACS)","","National Renewable Energy Lab.

However, it may not be available or reliable to classify different forecasting tasks by only using predefined meteorological weather categorization. In this paper, an unsupervised clustering-based (UC-based) solar forecasting method is developed for short-term (1-h-ahead) global horizontal irradiance (GHI) forecasting. This UC-based method consists of three parts: GHI time series unsupervised clustering, pattern recognition, and UC-based forecasting. The daily GHI time series is first clustered by an Optimized Cross-validated ClUsteRing (OCCUR) method, which determines the optimal number of clusters and best clustering results. Then, support vector machine pattern recognition is adopted to recognize the category of a certain day using the first four hours' data in the forecasting stage. GHI forecasts are generated by the most suitable models in different clusters, which are built by a two-layer machine learning based multi-model (M3) forecasting framework. The developed UC-M3 method is validated by using 1-year of data with 13 solar features from three information sources. Numerical results show that 1) UC-based models outperform non-UC (all-in-one) models with the same M3 architecture by approximately 20%; and 2) M3-based models also outperform the single-algorithm machine learning models by approximately 20%.","","","National Renewable Energy Lab.

The effect is a consequence of a strongly nonlinear dependence of the alloy band gap on chemical composition. Here, we use electronic structure calculations at different levels of theory (density functional theory (DFT), hybrid DFT, and QSGW, with and without spin-orbit interactions) to investigate the presently elusive origin of this effect. Contrary to current conflicting studies, our results show that neither spin-orbit interactions nor the composition induced changes of the crystal structure and ordering of atoms contributes to the nonlinearity of the band gap. We find that the strong nonlinearity is primarily a consequence of chemical effects, i.e., the mismatch in energy between s and p atomic orbitals of Pb and Sn, which form the band edges of the alloy. These results unravel the nature of the band gap bowing in Sn/Pb hybrid perovskite alloys and offer a relatively simple way to estimate evolution of the band gap in other hybrid perovskite alloys.","American Chemical Society (ACS)","","Energy Frontier Research Centers (EFRC) (United States).

The effects of this market concentration on prices are tested using a rich dataset of residential solar photovoltaic (PV) systems in the United States. A novel hypothesis is explored that the effects of market concentration may be non-monotonic. Prices may decline in market concentration due to efficiency gains associated with returns to scale but increase in concentration in already concentrated markets due to increasing market power. Finally, the results of an econometric model provide evidence to support the non-monotonic hypothesis.

"High p-type doping, mobility, and photocarrier lifetime in arsenic-doped CdTe single crystals","Nagaoka, Akira; Kuciauskas, Darius; McCoy, Jedidiah; Scarpulla, Michael A.","14 SOLAR ENERGY; 71 CLASSICAL AND QUANTUM MECHANICS, GENERAL PHYSICS; doping; crystal defects; solar energy; semiconductors","Here, Group-V element doping is promising for simultaneously maximizing the hole concentration and minority carrier lifetime in CdTe for thin film solar cells, but there are roadblocks concerning point defects including the possibility of self-compensation by AX metastability. Herein, we report on doping, lifetime, and mobility of CdTe single crystals doped with As between 10<sup>16</sup> and 10<sup>20</sup> cm<sup>–3</sup> grown from the Cd solvent by the travelling heater method. Evidence consistent with AX instability as a major contributor to compensation in samples doped below 10<sup>17</sup> cm<sup>–3</sup> is presented, while for higher-doped samples, precipitation of a second phase on planar structural defects is also observed and may explain spatial variation in properties such as lifetime. Rapid cooling after crystal growth increases doping efficiency and mobility for times up to 20–30 days at room temperature with the highest efficiencies observed close to 45% and a hole mobility of 70 cm<sup>2</sup>/Vs at room temperature. A doping limit in the low 10<sup>17</sup>/cm<sup>3</sup> range is observed for samples quenched at 200–300 °C/h. Bulk minority carrier lifetimes exceeding 20 ns are observed for samples doped near 10<sup>16</sup> cm<sup>–3</sup> relaxed in the dark and for unintentionally doped samples, while a lifetime of nearly 5 ns is observed for 10<sup>18</sup> cm<sup>–3</sup> As doping. These results help us to establish limits on properties expected for group-V doped CdTe polycrystalline thin films for use in photovoltaics.","American Institute of Physics (AIP)","","National Renewable Energy Lab.

However, the cost of current collection optics in a CSP plant hampers commercial competitiveness with PVs and natural gas. The use of a planar focusing collector (PFC) could help reduce cost of materials, installation, and maintenance. We present two candidate PFC designs, one based on metasurfaces and the other a Fresnel-like model. We feed each design through the entire system process (design, fabrication, scalability, and techno-economic feasibility) and discuss the challenges met at each stage. Two-photon and nanoimprint lithography are used to make PFC molds and replicas, respectively. We find that the annual optical efficiency for the Fresnel-based PFC is ~40%, higher than the current 30% target for natural gas, thereby suggesting potential economic advantages in the market of industrial process heat.","","","National Renewable Energy Lab.

"Assessment of a novel ternary eutectic chloride salt for next generation high-temperature sensible heat storage","Mohan, Gowtham; Venkataraman, Mahesh; Gomez-Vidal, Judith; Coventry, Joe","14 SOLAR ENERGY; 47 OTHER INSTRUMENTATION; high-temperature; sensible heat storage; melting point; heat capacity; mass loss; molten salt","A novel ternary eutectic salt mixture for high-temperature sensible heat storage, composed of sodium chloride, potassium chloride and magnesium chloride (NaKMg-Cl) was developed based on a phase diagram generated with FactSage(R). The differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) technique was used to experimentally validate the predicted melting point of the ternary eutectic composition, which was measured as 387 degrees C, in good agreement with the prediction. The ternary eutectic was compared to two binary salts formulated based on prediction of the eutectic composition by FactSage, but unfortunately DSC measurements showed that neither binary salt composition was eutectic. Nonetheless, the measured thermo-physical properties of the ternary and the two binary mixtures are compared. Liquid heat capacities of both the ternary and binary salts were determined by using DSC with sapphire as the standard reference. The average heat capacity of the ternary mixture was recorded as 1.18 J g<sup>-1</sup> K<sup>-1</sup>. The mass loss of the molten eutectic salts was studied up to 1000 degrees C using a thermogravimetric analyser in nitrogen, argon and air. The results showed a significant mass loss due to vaporisation in an open system, particularly above 700 degrees C. However, simulation of mass loss in a closed system with an inert cover gas indicates storage temperatures above 700 degrees C may be feasible, and highlights the importance of the design of the storage tank system. In terms of storage material cost, the NaKMg-Cl mixture is approximately 4.5 USD/kWh, which is 60% cheaper than current state-of-the-art nitrate salt mixtures.","Elsevier","","National Renewable Energy Lab.

"Internal Resistive Barriers Related to Zinc Diffusion During the Growth of Inverted Metamorphic Multijunction Solar Cells","Schulte, Kevin L.; Steiner, Myles A.; Young, Matthew R.; Geisz, John F.","14 SOLAR ENERGY; 36 MATERIALS SCIENCE; gallium arsenide; zinc; junctions; annealing; photovoltaic cells; photonic band gap; current measurement","Majority carrier barriers at heterointerfaces are a common source of non-linear resistance that hinders concentrator solar cell performance. The source of a particular barrier is often unclear in a multijunction device with numerous heterointerfaces. In this work, we demonstrate Zn-dopant diffusion during inverted metamorphic multijunction (IMM) device growth to be one key cause of internal barrier formation. Using an inverted GaAs/GaAs tandem solar cell with a high temperature annealing layer grown in between each subcell, we simulate the annealing conditions of a multijunction growth in a simplified structure. Through analysis of the device by secondary ion mass spectrometry (SIMS) and electrochemical capacitance-voltage profiling, we show that annealing causes Zn to diffuse out of the top cell Ga <sub>0.5</sub> In <sub>0.5</sub> P back surface field (BSF) and accumulate in the GaAs base. Through equilibrium band modeling, we show that the resultant doping profile forms an energetic barrier to hole flow in the valence band, which correlates with fill factor losses in the current-voltage curves measured under concentration. When we, instead, employ a C-doped Al <sub>0.2</sub> Ga <sub>0.8</sub> As BSF layer in the top cell, we do not observe evidence of a heterojunction barrier. We attribute this difference to the reduced diffusivity of carbon, confirmed by SIMS, as well as more favorable valence band offsets between GaAs and Al <sub>0.2</sub> Ga <sub>0.8</sub> As. Finally, we compare 5-junction IMM cells with Al <sub>0.2</sub> Ga <sub>0.8</sub> As:C and Ga <sub>0.5</sub> In <sub>0.5</sub> P:Zn BSF layers in the GaAs third junction, respectively, and show a significantly improved concentrator device performance when Al <sub>0.2</sub> Ga <sub>0.8</sub> As:C is employed. Lastly, we demonstrate the importance of designing annealing tolerance into multijunction structures that are subjected to extended annealing during growth.","IEEE","","National Renewable Energy Lab.

The low formation energies additionally facilitate dynamic transformation of the chemical composition and crystal structure of the MHP material. In this work, we show that CsBr salt is selectively extracted from CsPbBr<sub>3</sub> nanocrystals (NCs) to yield PbBr<sub>2</sub> NCs. The PbBr<sub>2</sub> NCs are then exposed to different glacial acetic acid ABr salt solutions to generate a variety of emissive compounds with the generic structure A'<sub>2</sub>A<sub>n-1</sub>Pb<sub>n</sub>Br<sub>3</sub><sub>n-1</sub>X'<sub>2</sub>, where A = cesium (Cs<sup>+</sup>), methylammonium (MA<sup>+</sup>), formamidinium (FA+); A' = A or H+; X' = Br- or acetate (CH3COO-); and n is the number of lead halide layers, where n = 1, 2, 3, ...8. We systematically vary the ratios of PbBr<sub>2</sub>/ABr/CH<sub>3</sub>COOH and show that certain ratios result in isolable single-phase APbBr3 NCs - an effective A-site cation exchange from the parent CsPbBr<sub>3</sub> NCs. Importantly, time-resolved photoluminescence (PL) spectroscopy shows the dynamic evolution of many additional species as evidenced by blue-shifted emission peaks from 2.85-2.49 eV for MA<sup>+</sup>-based structures. We assign these species to n = 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5 quasi-two-dimensional network (2DN) sheets, in which CH<sub>3</sub>COO- anions and Br- anions compete for the c-axis X' sites separating haloplumbate(II) layers within the A'<sub>2</sub>A<sub>n-1</sub>Pb<sub>n</sub>Br<sub>3n-1</sub>X'<sub>2</sub> NCs. Finally, we demonstrate the degree of CH<sub>3</sub>COO- incorporation, and thus the 2DN layer thickness and PL energy, is controlled in the early reaction times by kinetic factors.

Therefore, accurate knowledge of terrestrial UV incident on the surface of the PV materials is essential to understand the degradation of PV modules and provide reliable assessment of their service life. As PV is deployed in various climate zones, it is crucial that terrestrial UV information is available at various locations. However, the availability of terrestrial UV data - measured or modeled - is extremely limited. On the other hand, total solar irradiance (TS) datasets are relatively abundant. In this study, the National Renewable Energy Laboratory, its industry partners, and ASTM's International Subcommittee on Radiometry and Service Life Prediction are developing a simple method to estimate the clear-sky terrestrial UV irradiance (280-400 nm, 295-400 nm, 285-385 nm, or 295-385 nm) from total irradiance data (280-4000 nm). The goal is to provide reliable estimates of the UV received by samples as a function of location, orientation, tilt, and airmass, thus encompassing a variety of conditions. Here, the Simple Model of the Atmospheric Radiative Transfer of Sunshine (SMARTS) model is used to estimate the UV:TS ratio under various scenarios, and examines the influences of atmospheric constituents, such as aerosols, precipitable water vapor or ozone, and of the local surface characteristics (albedo), on the predicted UV.","IEEE","","National Renewable Energy Lab.

Well-controlled and understood charge carrier transport through the device stack is required to make the next step in efficiency improvements. In this work, polymer-wrapped single-walled carbon nanotube (SWNT) films embedded in an insulating poly(methyl methacrylate) (PMMA) matrix and capped by a thermally evaporated Au electrode are investigated as a composite hole transport layer and optical spacer. Employing transient absorption spectroscopy we show that the SWNTs enhance the charge transfer rate from CQD to CQD, ZnO, or SWNT. In order to pinpoint the underlying mechanism for the improvement, we investigate the energetics of the junction by measuring the relative alignment of the band edges, using Kelvin probe and cyclic voltammetry. Measuring the external quantum efficiency and absorption we find that the improvement is not mainly from electronic improvements but from enhanced absorption of the CQD absorber. We demonstrate experimentally and theoretically, by employing a transfer-matrix model, that the transparent PMMA matrix acts as an optical spacer, which leads to an enhanced absorption in the absorber layer.

To circumvent these limitations, we developed a procedure where two transparent conductive oxide/transport material/perovskite half stacks are independently fabricated and then laminated together at the perovskite/perovskite interface. Using ultraviolet-visible absorption spectroscopy, external quantum efficiency, X-ray diffraction, and time-resolved photoluminesence spectroscopy, we show that this procedure improves photovoltaic properties of the perovskite layer. Applying this procedure, semitransparent devices employing two high-temperature oxide transport layers were fabricated, which realized an average efficiency of 9.6% (maximum: 10.6%) despite series resistance limitations from the substrate design. Overall, the developed lamination procedure curtails processing constraints, enables new device designs, and affords new opportunities for optimization.","American Chemical Society (ACS)","","National Renewable Energy Lab.

This work presents a novel method for incorporating the value of resilience provided by a PV and BESS into a techno-economic optimization model. Including the value of resilience in the design of a cost-optimal PV and BESS generally increases the system capacities, and in some cases makes a system economical where it was not before. For example, for a large hotel in Anaheim, CA no system is economical without resilience valued; however, with a $5317/hr value of resilience a 363 kW and 60 kWh solar and BESS provides a net present value of $50,000.

"Experimental demonstration of a dispatchable latent heat storage system with aluminum-silicon as a phase change material","Rea, Jonathan E.; Oshman, Christopher J.; Singh, Abhishek; Alleman, Jeff; Parilla, Philip A.; Hardin, Corey L.; Olsen, Michele L.; Siegel, Nathan P.; Ginley, David S.; Toberer, Eric S.","14 SOLAR ENERGY; 47 OTHER INSTRUMENTATION; thermal energy storage; phase change material; concentrating solar power; thermal valve; heat pipe; thermosyphon","In this work, we present the design, construction, and experimental results of a prototype latent heat thermal energy storage system. The prototype consists of a thermal storage tank with 100 kg of the aluminum-silicon eutectic as a phase change material, a valved thermosyphon that controls heat flow from the thermal storage tank to the power block, and thermoelectric generators for conversion of heat to electricity. We tested the prototype over four simulated days, where each day consisted of four phases of operation: charging, discharging, simultaneous charging and discharging, and storage. Our results show three major conclusions. First, the thermal energy storage system was able to receive and distribute heat with small temperature gradients - less than 5 degrees C throughout the thermal storage tank. Second, the valved thermosyphon was able to effectively control heat transfer, demonstrating an on/off thermal conductance ratio of 430. Third, the interfaces between subsystems had small temperature drops: of the ~ 560 degrees C temperature drop from the thermal storage tank to the heat rejection system, ~ 525 degrees C occurred across the power block. This work overcomes the challenges of integrating previously-developed subsystems together, providing a proof-of-concept of this system.","Elsevier","","National Renewable Energy Lab.

"Setting the Smart Solar Standard: Collaborations Between Hawaiian Electric and the National Renewable Energy Laboratory","Hoke, Andy; Giraldez, Julieta; Palmintier, Bryan; Ifuku, Earle; Asano, Marc; Ueda, Reid; Symko-Davies, Martha","14 SOLAR ENERGY; 24 POWER TRANSMISSION AND DISTRIBUTION; distributed generation; inverters; photovoltaic systems; quasti-static time-series simulation; power hardware-in-the-loop","Driving through many neighborhoods of Hawai'i, it is hard to miss the nearly ubiquitous rooftop solar photovoltaic (PV) systems that have popped up during the past eight years or so. Relatively high electricity costs associated with island grids, coupled with various incentives, have made it cost-effective to install solar over the last eight years, as evidenced by the PV-deployment chart in Figure 1. On the most populous island, O'ahu, the PV nameplate acgenerating capacity of 502 MW totals nearly half of the annual peak load for the entire island, which is 1.1 GW . Of that 502 MW of PVs, 54% is from private rooftop solar-nearly 50,000 residences or roughly one of every three single family homes. But Hawaiian Electric, the local utility, has no way to monitor or control the PV generation, even for most nonresidential systems. This means that on sunny days, up to approximately half of the PV generation is outside of the utility's control. This poses many challenges for utility planners and operators-challenges that Hawaiian Electric has been working diligently to address, along with various partners, notably the U.S. Department of Energy (DOE), the National Renewable Energy Laboratory (NREL), and its Energy System's Integration Facility (ESIF). This article describes how Hawaiian Electric has worked with engineers in NREL's Power Systems Engineering Center to improve the way its grid operates with very high levels of distributed PVs, largely by changing the way the PV inverters are operated.","IEEE","","National Renewable Energy Lab.

By utilizing open weather forecast and power measurement data, this prediction method is processed within a set of historical data with similar meteorological data (temperature and irradiance), and astronomical date (solar time and earth declination angle). Further, clustering and blending strategies are applied to improve its accuracy in regional PV forecasting. The robustness of the proposed method is demonstrated with three different numerical weather prediction models, the North American Mesoscale Forecast System, the Global Forecast System, and the Short-Range Ensemble Forecast, for both region level and single site level PV forecasts. Using real measured data, the new forecasting approach is applied to the load zone in Southeastern Massachusetts as a case study. In conclusion, the normalized root mean square error (NRMSE) has been reduced by 13.80%-61.21% when compared with three tested baselines.","IEEE","","National Renewable Energy Lab.

Semiconducting single-walled carbon nanotubes (s-SWCNTs), unique one-dimensional electron donors with molecule-like absorption and highly mobile charges, provide a model system for studying interfacial exciton dissociation. Here, we investigate excited-state photodynamics at the heterojunction between (6,5) s-SWCNTs and two perylene diimide (PDI)-based electron acceptors. Each of the PDI-based acceptors, hPDI2-pyr-hPDI2 and Trip-hPDI2, is deposited onto (6,5) s-SWCNT films to form a heterojunction bilayer. Transient absorption measurements demonstrate that photoinduced hole/electron transfer occurs at the photoexcited bilayer interfaces, producing long-lived separated charges with lifetimes exceeding 1.0 us. Both exciton dissociation and charge recombination occur more slowly for the hPDI2-pyr-hPDI2 bilayer than for the Trip-hPDI2 bilayer. To explain such differences, we discuss the potential roles of the thermodynamic charge transfer driving force available at each interface and the different molecular structure and intermolecular interactions of PDI-based acceptors. As a result, detailed photophysical analysis of these model systems can develop the fundamental understanding of exciton dissociation between organic electron donors and nonfullerene acceptors, which has not been systematically studied.","American Chemical Society","","National Renewable Energy Lab.

We exercise an existing optimization model that maximizes revenue over a year-long time horizon, solved using a standard 48-h look-ahead policy at hourly fidelity on a CSP system under development in California. The system employs molten salt power tower technology with a 150 MWe (net) turbine, eight hours of thermal storage at full load, and a solar field that provides 1.75 times the rated turbine thermal power. The model considers system configuration and interoperability aspects, such as storage tank size, production capacities, and ramp rates, and determines decisions that expedite financing, permitting, and plant design. Relative to results achieved via industry practice, the existing optimization model reduces the number of power cycle (i.e., turbine) start-up events by 86.4%, thereby improving net revenue by more than 8.5% annually; this corresponds to an approximately $140 M increase in net revenue over the lifetime of the plant, taking a step towards advancing the long-term economic viability of large-scale renewable energy systems. Sensitivity analysis on uncertain parameter values provides insight regarding those values that influence profit most significantly.","Elsevier","","National Renewable Energy Lab.

"Strategies for Thinning Graded Buffer Regions in Metamorphic Solar Cells and Performance Tradeoffs","Schulte, Kevin L.; France, Ryan M.; Guthrey, Harvey L.; Geisz, John F.","14 SOLAR ENERGY; 71 CLASSICAL AND QUANTUM MECHANICS, GENERAL PHYSICS; strain; III-V semiconductor materials; indium phosphide; lattices; gallium arsenide; photovoltaic cells; switches","Compositionally graded buffers (CGBs) have enabled the development of inverted metamorphic (IMM) multijunction solar cells that contain three or more junctions and exhibit record efficiencies. Typically, the CGB is grown thick with a constant grading rate, because this is the most straightforward way to minimize the threading dislocation density (TDD) in device active regions. The CGB growth represents a significant expense, in terms of materials consumption and capital cost, however, hampering the economic viability of metamorphic devices. This work explores strategies for thinning Ga1-xInxP CGBs from GaAs to InP while minimizing performance loss, as evaluated by the open-circuit voltage (VOC) of ~0.74 eV Ga0.47In0.53As solar cells. Using the Ga1-xInxP CGB as a model, we demonstrate that slower grading is necessary in certain regions of the grade where dislocation nucleation rates are higher. Grading must be more gradual in these regions to suppress threading dislocation density. Grading rates can be increased in non-critical areas where dislocation nucleation is lower, permitting a thinner buffer. We demonstrate the relationship between VOC and TDD, establishing tradeoffs between thickness and performance. Through careful design, we demonstrate a CGB with a 40% thickness reduction (2 im) achieved with a VOC decrease of only 6.3% (21 mV).","IEEE","","National Renewable Energy Lab.

Several such blocks, each containing a converter power stage and controls, are connected in series on their ac sides to obtain transformerless medium-voltage ac interfaces for PV power plants. The series-connected structure is made possible by a quadruple active bridge dc-dc converter that provides isolation between the PV input and each of the three ac-side phases within each block. Furthermore, since incoming PV power is transferred as constant balanced three-phase ac power, instantaneous inputoutput power balance bypasses the need for bulk energy storage. To streamline implementation and maximize system scalability and resilience, decentralized block-level controllers accomplish dc-link voltage regulation, maximum power point tracking, and ac-side power sharing without centralized means. The proposed architecture is validated by simulations of a PV string to mediumvoltage ac system consisting of six blocks and on a proof-of-concept hardware prototype that consists of three cascaded converter blocks.","IEEE","","National Renewable Energy Lab.

"A methodology to analyze photovoltaic tracker uptime","Ruth, Dan; Muller, Matthew","14 SOLAR ENERGY; 47 OTHER INSTRUMENTATION; clear-sky modeling; photovoltaic performance; tracking","A metric is developed to analyze the daily performance of single-axis photovoltaic (PV) trackers. The metric relies on comparing correlations between the daily time series of the PV power output and an array of simulated plane-of-array irradiances for the given day. Mathematical thresholds and a logic sequence are presented, so the daily tracking metric can be applied in an automated fashion on large-scale PV systems. The results of applying the metric are visually examined against the time series of the power output data for a large number of days and for various systems. The visual inspection results suggest that overall, the algorithm is accurate in identifying stuck or functioning trackers on clear-sky days. Visual inspection also shows that there are days that are not classified by the metric where the power output data may be sufficient to identify a stuck tracker. Based on the daily tracking metric, uptime results are calculated for 83 different inverters at 34 PV sites. The mean tracker uptime is calculated at 99% based on 2 different calculation methods. The daily tracking metric clearly has limitations, but as there is no existing metrics in the literature, it provides a valuable tool for flagging stuck trackers.","Wiley","","National Renewable Energy Lab.

Recently, however, customers are increasingly shopping for PV using third-party online platforms that make it easier to obtain and compare quotes from multiple installers. While early evidence indicates that these platforms make the PV market more transparent and lower prices, the literature suggests that market outcomes are critically linked to detailed aspects of platform design. In this study, we econometrically analyze a unique dataset of quotes offered in the online PV marketplace EnergySage to investigate how four changes to the platform design have influenced quote prices and transaction prices. We find that the largest reductions in quote prices ($0.11/ W) and transaction prices ($0.15/W) were associated with the introduction of a price guidance information feature for installers. While educating and informing customers has repeatedly emerged as a policy priority for bolstering PV markets, these results suggest that the same should be true on the supply side. We also find that customers are willing to pay higher transaction prices for systems with higher-quality panels, dispelling concerns that online PV marketplaces lead to a 'race to the bottom' phenomenon by emphasizing price at the expense of quality.","Elsevier","","National Renewable Energy Lab.

Low-temperature luminescence spectra emitted from doped poly-Si layers are found to be very broad and stretched from the crystalline silicon (c-Si) luminescence peak to significantly lower energies. This suggests that these layers contain radiative defect levels whose energies are continuously distributed from the band edges to deep levels in the poly-Si bandgap. Moreover, photoinduced carriers inside poly-Si layers are found to be completely blocked by an ultrathin SiOx interlayer (~1.3 nm). This demonstrates that there is no free-carrier coupling from poly-Si layers in practical passivating-contact solar cells.

A native oxide SiO<sub>2</sub> on Si is often inevitable. However, it is not clear if this layer has a positive or negative effect on the battery performance. This understanding is complicated by the lack of knowledge about the physical properties of the SiO<sub>2</sub> lithiation products and by the convolution of chemical and electrochemical effects during the anode lithiation process. In this study, Li<sub>x</sub>SiO<sub>y</sub> thin films as model materials for lithiated SiO<sub>2</sub> were deposited by magnetron sputtering at ambient temperature, with the goal of (1) decoupling chemical reactivity from electrochemical reactivity and (2) evaluating the physical and electrochemical properties of Li<sub>x</sub>SiO<sub>y</sub>. X-ray photoemission spectroscopy analysis of the deposited thin films demonstrate that a composition close to previous experimental reports of lithiated native SiO<sub>2</sub> can be achieved through sputtering. Our density functional theory calculations also confirm that the possible phases formed by lithiating SiO<sub>2</sub> are very close to the measured film compositions. Scanning probe microscopy measurements show that the mechanical properties of the film are strongly dependent on lithium concentration, with a ductile behavior at a higher Li content and a brittle behavior at a lower Li content. The chemical reactivity of the thin films was investigated by measuring the AC impedance evolution, suggesting that Li<sub>x</sub>SiO<sub>y</sub> continuously reacts with the electrolyte, in part because of the high electronic conductivity of the film determined from solid-state impedance measurements. The electrochemical cycling data of the sputter-deposited Li<sub>x</sub>SiO<sub>y</sub>/Si films also suggest that Li<sub>x</sub>SiO<sub>y</sub> is not beneficial in stabilizing the Si anode surface during battery operation, despite its favorable mechanical properties.","American Chemical Society (ACS)","","National Renewable Energy Lab.

"Consequences of neglecting the interannual variability of the solar resource: A case study of photovoltaic power among the Hawaiian Islands","Bryce, Richard; Losada Carreno, Ignacio; Kumler, Andrew; Hodge, Bri-Mathias; Roberts, Billy; Brancucci Martinez-Anido, Carlo","14 SOLAR ENERGY; 24 POWER TRANSMISSION AND DISTRIBUTION; interannual; variability; photovoltaics; irradiance; capacity factor; economics","The interannual variability of the solar irradiance and meteorological conditions are often ignored in favor of single-year data sets for modeling power generation and evaluating the economic value of photovoltaic (PV) power systems. Yet interannual variability significantly impacts the generation from one year to another of renewable power systems such as wind and PV. Consequently, the interannual variability of power generation corresponds to the interannual variability of capital returns on investment. The penetration of PV systems within the Hawaiian Electric Companies' portfolio has rapidly accelerated in recent years and is expected to continue to increase given the state's energy objectives laid out by the Hawaii Clean Energy Initiative. We use the National Solar Radiation Database (1998-2015) to characterize the interannual variability of the solar irradiance and meteorological conditions across the State of Hawaii. These data sets are passed to the National Renewable Energy Laboratory's System Advisory Model (SAM) to calculate an 18-year PV power generation data set to characterize the variability of PV power generation. We calculate the interannual coefficient of variability (COV) for annual average global horizontal irradiance (GHI) on the order of 2% and COV for annual capacity factor on the order of 3% across the Hawaiian archipelago. Regarding the interannual variability of seasonal trends, we calculate the COV for monthly average GHI values on the order of 5% and COV for monthly capacity factor on the order of 10%. We model residential-scale and utility-scale PV systems and calculate the economic returns of each system via the payback period and the net present value. We demonstrate that studies based on single-year data sets for economic evaluations reach conclusions that deviate from the true values realized by accounting for interannual variability.","Elsevier","","National Renewable Energy Lab.

"Trade-off between Photon Management Efficacy and Material Quality in Thin-Film Solar Cells on Nanostructured Substrates of High Aspect Ratio Structures","Chin, Alan; Keshavarz, Majid; Wang, Qi","14 SOLAR ENERGY; 77 NANOSCIENCE AND NANOTECHNOLOGY; solar cells; photon management; nanostructured substrate; photovoltaics","Although texturing of the transparent electrode of thin-film solar cells has long been used to enhance light absorption via light trapping, such texturing has involved low aspect ratio features. With the recent development of nanotechnology, nanostructured substrates enable improved light trapping and enhanced optical absorption via resonances, a process known as photon management, in thin-film solar cells. Despite the progress made in the development of photon management in thin-film solar cells using nanostructures substrates, the structural integrity of the thin-film solar cells deposited onto such nanostructured substrates is rarely considered. Here, we report the observation of the reduction in the open circuit voltage of amorphous silicon solar cells deposited onto a nanostructured substrate with increasing areal number density of high aspect ratio structures. For a nanostructured substrate with the areal number density of such nanostructures increasing in correlation with the distance from one edge of the substrate, a correlation between the open circuit voltage reduction and the increase of the areal number density of high aspect ratio nanostructures of the front electrode of the small-size amorphous silicon solar cells deposited onto different regions of the substrate with graded nanostructure density indicates the effect of the surface morphology on the material quality, i.e., a trade-off between photon management efficacy and material quality. Lastly, this observed trade-off highlights the importance of optimizing the morphology of the nanostructured substrate to ensure conformal deposition of the thin-film solar cell.","MDPI","","National Renewable Energy Lab.

The data on the map have been used to conduct the first regional analysis of soiling distribution in the United States. We found that most of the soiling occurs in the southwestern United States, with Southern California counties experiencing the greatest losses because of the high particulate matter concentrations and the long dry periods. Moreover, we employed five spatial-interpolation techniques to investigate the possibility of estimating soiling at a site using data from nearby sites.

We redesigned our reactor to eliminate unintentional impurities, which led to a reduction of nearly 30<sup>x</sup> in dark current. This improvement led to a significantly improved open-circuit voltage of 1.41 V and a band gap-voltage offset of 0.47 V in a device with a rear reflector, achieved without front surface passivation. We demonstrate that the limiting factor toward achieving higher efficiency is control over the emitter thickness. Recombination is high in the unpassivated emitter, but losses can be minimized by designing it to be thin. We show that Se diffusion from the GaAs contact layer into the base is responsible for unintentional thickening of the emitter. Use of reduced contact doping reduces the penetration of Se into the p-GaInP base layer. With improved control of Se diffusion, we achieve 13.0 mA/cm<sup>2</sup> and 15.2% certified efficiency in a single-junction GaInP cell structure that is optically equivalent to the top cell in a GaInP/GaAs tandem.","IEEE","","National Renewable Energy Lab.

As a result, PV systems may experience higher failure rates and accelerated ageing. In this paper, a cell-level simulation model is used to assess occurrence of hot-spotting events in a representative residential rooftop system scenario featuring a moderate shading environment. The approach is further used to examine how well distributed power electronics converters mitigate the effects of partial shading and other sources of mismatch by preventing activation of bypass diodes and thereby reducing the chances of heavy power dissipation and hot-spotting in mismatched cells. The simulation results confirm that the occurrence of heavy power dissipation is reduced in all distributed power electronics architectures, and that submodule-level converters offer nearly 100% mitigation of hot-spotting. In addition, the paper further elaborates on the possibility of hot-spot-induced permanent damage, predicting a lifetime energy loss above 15%. In conclusion, this energy loss is fully recoverable with submodule-level power converters that mitigate hot-spotting and prevent the damage.","MDPI AG","","National Renewable Energy Lab.

Due to the strong volatility and uncertainty, the high penetration of PV generation immensely exacerbates the conditions of voltage violation in ADNs. However, the emerging flexible interconnection technology based on soft open points (SOPs) provides increased controllability and flexibility to the system operation. For fully exploiting the regulation ability of SOPs to address the problems caused by PV, this paper proposes a robust optimization method to achieve the robust optimal operation of SOPs in ADNs. A two-stage adjustable robust optimization model is built to tackle the uncertainties of PV outputs, in which robust operation strategies of SOPs are generated to eliminate the voltage violations and reduce the power losses of ADNs. A column-and-constraint generation (C&CG) algorithm is developed to solve the proposed robust optimization model, which are formulated as second-order cone program (SOCP) to facilitate the accuracy and computation efficiency. Here, case studies on the modified IEEE 33-node system and comparisons with the deterministic optimization approach are conducted to verify the effectiveness and robustness of the proposed method.","IEEE","","National Renewable Energy Lab.

"Assessment of uncertainty in the numerical simulation of solar irradiance over inclined PV panels: New algorithms using measurements and modeling tools","Xie, Yu; Sengupta, Manajit; Dooraghi, Mike","14 SOLAR ENERGY; solar radiation; radiative transfer; model uncertainty; POA irradiance","Development of accurate transposition models to simulate plane-of-array (POA) irradiance from horizontal measurements or simulations is a complex process mainly because of the anisotropic distribution of diffuse solar radiation in the atmosphere. The limited availability of reliable POA measurements at large temporal and spatial scales leads to difficulties in the comprehensive evaluation of transposition models. This paper proposes new algorithms to assess the uncertainty of transposition models using both surface-based observations and modeling tools. We reviewed the analytical derivation of POA irradiance and the approximation of isotropic diffuse radiation that simplifies the computation. Two transposition models are evaluated against the computation by the rigorous analytical solution. We proposed a new algorithm to evaluate transposition models using the clear-sky measurements at the National Renewable Energy Laboratory's (NREL's) Solar Radiation Research Laboratory (SRRL) and a radiative transfer model that integrates diffuse radiances of various sky-viewing angles. We found that the radiative transfer model and a transposition model based on empirical regressions are superior to the isotropic models when compared to measurements. We further compared the radiative transfer model to the transposition models under an extensive range of idealized conditions. Our results suggest that the empirical transposition model has slightly higher cloudy-sky POA irradiance than the radiative transfer model, but performs better than the isotropic models under clear-sky conditions. Significantly smaller POA irradiances computed by the transposition models are observed when the photovoltaics (PV) panel deviates from the azimuthal direction of the sun. The new algorithms developed in the current study have opened the door to a more comprehensive evaluation of transposition models for various atmospheric conditions and solar and PV orientations.","Elsevier","","National Renewable Energy Lab.

This build-up increases the receiver thermal losses and results in a decline in power output. Prior numerical work has shown that removal of hydrogen from the head space gas (HSG) in the plant expansion tanks can be an effective mitigation strategy. This approach requires a matching molar rate of hydrogen coming out of solution from liquid HTF into the HSG. Simulations show that the driving force introduced by removing hydrogen from the HSG results in sufficiently large hydrogen transport rates solely across the surface interface (with no active mixing or bubbling). However, uncertainties in Henry's Law Constant and especially mass transfer coefficient require obtaining experimental data to back up the simulations. This paper presents an experimental procedure and measured data for Henry's Law Constant and interface mass transfer coefficient for hydrogen absorbing in the binary eutectic mixture biphenyl/diphenyl ether as HTF. To the best of our knowledge, the experiment is the first of its kind to derive these two parameters in a relatively inexpensive, straightforward, and rapid manner, with moderate accuracy (about +/-15% uncertainty). Measurements were taken at different temperatures, pressures, HTF mixing rates, HTF aging, and HSG compositions. The design of the experiment was based on literature review and numerical models simulating the transient and equilibrium behavior of the hydrogen/HTF system at laboratory-scale conditions. Values measured for Henry's Law Constant are around 400 bar/(mol/L), and they decrease slightly with increasing temperature. Both this magnitude and temperature dependency agree with correlations found in literature. The mass transfer coefficient measured for pure hydrogen dissolving in HTF ranges from 5 x 10-7 mol/(s mbar m2) (for 100 degrees C) to 4 x 10-6 mol/(s mbar m2) (for 293 degrees C). These values and strong temperature dependency agree with theoretical model predictions. HTF aging and mixing rate had negligible impact on the mass transfer coefficient. Lowering the hydrogen HSG pressure slightly increased the mass transfer coefficient (up to 10%). The presence of nitrogen significantly increased the mass transfer coefficient (up to 100%).","Elsevier","","National Renewable Energy Lab.

One such avoided cost that has received little attention is the market price response, or how distributed PV generation reduces utilities' procurement costs and, consequently, consumers' costs through reduced wholesale electricity prices in the short-term. We quantify the reduction in day-ahead wholesale electricity prices to distributed PV generation in California (CA) from 2013 through 2015. Using a database of all distributed PV systems in the three CA investor owned utilities, we estimate historic hourly distributed PV generation using three methods that we validate with metered generation from 205 PV systems. Via multiple linear regression, we then estimate electricity price reductions due to distributed PV generation. Across the three methods used to estimate PV generation, distributed PV generation reduced hourly median (mean) wholesale electricity prices by up to $2.7-3.1/MWh ($2.9-3.2/MWh) ($2015), or by 7-8% (8-9%). Lower wholesale prices reduced utilities' energy procurement costs in the day-ahead market by up to $650-730 million ($2015) from 2013 through 2015. These avoided costs are similar to other avoided costs commonly included in value of solar studies.","Elsevier","","National Renewable Energy Lab.

There is a growing body of literature evaluating the extent of this corresponding price reduction, termed 'incentive pass-through', typically finding nearly complete path-through for host-owned systems. However, few studies hitherto had the data to reliably estimate path-through for third-party owned systems, which comprise most of new installations over this period. This study evaluates incentive pass-through for third-party owned systems in California between 2010 and 2014. The estimation results show path-through rate is around 62%, suggesting that unlike host-owned systems, a portion of the incentive reduced the contract price of the system and the rest of the incentive was retained by the installer. This study has important implications for future subsidy program design in the presence of different ownership types in the market.","Elsevier","","National Renewable Energy Lab.

Relative to MERRA-2, these improvements result in lower uncertainty in the solar irradiance components. The most recent version of the NSRDB now uses hourly MERRA-2 aerosol data with bias and elevation correction.

Herein, we investigate the degradation of MHP solutions based on the most widely used solvents, dimethylformamide (DMF) and dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO). For the MHP inks studied, which contain formamidinium (FA+), methylammonium (MA+), cesium (Cs+), lead (Pb2+), bromide (Br-), and iodide (I-), dramatic compositional changes are observed following storage of the inks in nitrogen in the dark. We show that hydrolysis of DMF in the precursor solution forms dimethylammonium formate, which subsequently incorporates into the MHP film to compromise the ability of Cs+ and MA+ to stabilize FA+-based MHP. The changes in solution chemistry lead to a modification of the perovskite film stoichiometry, band gap, and structure. The solid precursor salts are stable when ball-milled into a powder, allowing for the storage of large quantities of stoichiometric precursor materials.","American Chemical Society (ACS)","","National Renewable Energy Lab.

"A comparison of price-taker and production cost models for determining system value, revenue, and scheduling of concentrating solar power plants","Martinek, Janna; Jorgenson, Jennie; Mehos, Mark; Denholm, Paul","14 SOLAR ENERGY; 29 ENERGY PLANNING, POLICY, AND ECONOMY; concentrating solar power; thermal energy storage; dispatch optimization; grid integration","Concentrating solar power (CSP) plants convert solar energy into electricity and can be coupled with low-cost thermal energy storage to provide a dispatchable renewable resource. Maximizing the economic benefits of CSP systems requires deliberate selection of the timing of thermal energy dispatch to coincide with high-price or high-value periods. The performance and value of CSP systems have traditionally been evaluated using two distinct approaches: (1) production cost models (PCMs), which optimize commitment and dispatch schedules for an entire fleet of generators to minimize the cost of satisfying electricity demand; and (2) price-taker (PT) models, which optimize dispatch of the CSP system against historical or forecasted electricity prices to maximize revenue available to the CSP operator. The PCM approach is, in principle, superior because of the ability to capture system-level details such as transmission pathways and associated constraints, and feedback between CSP dispatch schedules and operation of other generators. The computationally simpler PT technique cannot explicitly address these concerns, but the comparative reduction in solution time is attractive for sensitivity analysis and rigorous optimization of CSP plant design and operation. In this work, we directly compare the dispatch profiles, net revenue, and operational value of CSP systems using implementations of each technique to assess how closely the solutions from the PT technique can approach those from the PCM for a specific market scenario. The PT implementation produced characteristically similar dispatch profiles as the PCM for both a large solar-multiple configuration and a small solar-multiple peaking configuration, while requiring only 1% of the computational time of the PCM. In addition, dispatching the CSP plant according to the self-scheduled PT solution - as opposed to the system-optimized PCM solution - only reduced the total CSP operational value by 1-5%, with consistent trends across CSP configurations and locations. This analysis validates the ability of the PT approach to substantially capture the economic benefits of CSP systems when pricing profiles are available, and indicates that the PT approach is suitable for initial design and optimization of CSP technologies.","Elsevier","","National Renewable Energy Lab.

"A Fast All-sky Radiation Model for Solar applications with Narrowband Irradiances on Tilted surfaces (FARMS-NIT): Part I. The clear-sky model","Xie, Yu; Sengupta, Manajit","14 SOLAR ENERGY; 47 OTHER INSTRUMENTATION; solar radiation; plane of array; POA; irradiance; radiative transfer model; surface observation","The solar energy industry often uses individual steps to empirically compute plane-of-array (POA) irradiance from horizontal irradiance and decompose it to narrow-wavelength bands. Conventional radiative transfer models designed for meteorological applications requires significant computing efforts in practice; however, they provide a physics-based solution of radiance and therefore are capable of computing spectral POA irradiances in a single step. In this study, we integrate the advantages of the current models and develop an innovative radiative transfer model, the Fast All-sky Radiation Model for Solar applications with Narrowband Irradiances on Tilted surfaces (FARMS-NIT), to efficiently compute irradiances on inclined photovoltaics (PV) panels for 2002 narrow-wavelength bands from 0.28 to 4.0 um. This study is reported in two parts. Part I presents the methodology and performance evaluation of the new model under clear-sky conditions. The Simple Model of the Atmospheric Radiative Transfer of Sunshine (SMARTS), which was designed to compute clear-sky irradiances, is employed to rapidly provide the optical properties of a given clear-sky atmosphere. The clear-sky radiances in the narrow-wavelength bands are computed by considering three paths of photon transmission and solving the radiative transfer equation with the single-scattering approximation. The Bi-directional Transmittance Distribution Function (BTDF) of aerosols is given by their single-scattering phase function with a correction using a two-stream approximation. The validation analysis confirms that FARMS-NIT has improved accuracy compared to TMYSPEC as evaluated by both surface observations and a state-of-the-art radiative transfer model. This model substantially improves computational efficiency compared to other radiative transfer models though it uses slightly more computing time than TMYSPEC. Part II of this study addresses the model in cloud-sky conditions and will be published as a companion paper.","Elsevier","","National Renewable Energy Lab.

However, their energy conversion efficiencies are typically much lower than those of bulk electrodes. It is unclear to what extent this efficiency gap stems from differences among nanoflakes (e.g., area, thickness, and surface structural features). It is also unclear whether individual exfoliated nanoflakes can achieve energy conversion efficiencies similar to those of bulk crystals. Here, we use a single-nanoflake photo-electrochemical approach to show that there are both highly active and completely inactive nanoflakes within a film. For the exfoliated MoSe<sub>2</sub> samples studied herein, 7% of nanoflakes are highly active champions, whose photocurrent efficiency exceeds that of the bulk crystal. However, 66% of nanoflakes are inactive spectators, which are mostly responsible for the overall lower photocurrent efficiency compared to the bulk crystal. The photocurrent collection efficiency increases with nanoflake area and decreases more at perimeter edges than at interior step edges. These observations, which are hidden in ensemble-level measurements, reveal the underlying performance issues of exfoliated TMD electrodes for photo-electrochemical energy conversion applications.","American Chemical Society","","National Renewable Energy Lab.

Yet a basic understanding of the interaction of photoexcited electron-hole (e-h) pairs with new physical features that are introduced by the co-doping process (free carriers, defect states, and surface chemistry) is missing. Here, we present the first study of the ultrafast carrier dynamics in SiO2-embedded P-B co-doped Si NC ensembles using induced absorption spectroscopy through a two-step approach. First, the induced absorption data show that the large fraction of the dopants residing on the NC surface slows down carrier relaxation dynamics within the first 20 ps relative to intrinsic (undoped) Si NCs, which we interpret as enhanced surface passivation. On longer time-scales (picosecond to nanosecond regime), we observe a speeding up of the carrier relaxation dynamics and ascribe it to doping-induced trap states. This argument is deduced from the second part of the study, where we investigate multiexciton interactions. From a stochastic modeling approach we show that localized carriers, which are introduced by the P or B dopants, have minor electronic interactions with the photoexcited e-h pairs. This is understood in light of the strong localization of the introduced carriers on their original P- or B-dopant atoms, due to the strong quantum confinement regime in these relatively small NCs (<6 nm).","American Chemical Society","","National Renewable Energy Lab.

When PDT is performed at an elevated temperature, an accompanying annealing effect is expected. Here, we investigate how thermal annealing affects the redistribution of alkali metals in CIGS solar cells on glass substrates and the properties of the solar cells. In addition, we investigate the origin of non-homogeneous alkali-metal depth profiles that are typical of CIGS grown using a three-stage process. In particular, we use secondary-ion mass spectrometry measurements of the ion concentration as a function of distance from the CIGS surface to investigate the impact of thermal annealing on the distribution of alkali metals (Na, Ka, and Rb) and constituent elements (Ga and In) in the CIGS absorbers. We find that the depth profiles of the alkali metals strongly reflect the density of sites that tend to accommodate alkali metals, i.e., vacancies. Annealing at elevated temperature caused a redistribution of the alkali metals. The thermal-diffusion kinetics of alkali metals depends strongly on the species involved. We introduced low flux potassium fluoride (KF) to study a side effect of KF-PDT, i.e., Na removal from CIGS, separately from its predominant effects such as surface modification. When sufficient amounts of Na are supplied from the soda lime glass via annealing at an elevated temperature, the negative effect was not apparent.

Photobleaching dynamics of these donor materials are then studied under white light illumination in air with blends of PC<sub>70</sub>BM and the bistrifluoromethylfullerene 1,7-C<sub>60</sub>(CF<sub>3</sub>)<sub>2</sub>. For both the polymer and small molecule blends, C<sub>60</sub>(CF<sub>3</sub>)<sub>2</sub> stabilizes the initial rate of photobleaching by a factor of 15 relative to PC70BM. However, once the small molecule:C<sub>60</sub>(CF<sub>3</sub>)<sub>2</sub> blend bleaches to ~80% of its initial optical density, the rate of photobleaching dramatically accelerates, which is not observed in the analagous polymer blend. We probe that phenomenon using time-resovled photoluminescence (TRPL) to measure PL quenching efficiencies at defined intervals during the photobleaching experiments. The data indicates the small molecule donor and C<sub>60</sub>(CF<sub>3</sub>)<sub>2</sub> acceptor significantly de-mix with time, after which the blend begins to bleach at approximately the same rate as the neat donor sample. The work suggests that perfluoroalkylfullerenes have great potential to stabilize certain OPV active layers toward photodegradation, provided their morphology is stable.","Royal Society of Chemistry","","National Renewable Energy Lab.

Both field-stressed modules and laboratory-stressed mini modules were studied. We used photoluminescence, electroluminescence, and dark lock-in thermography imaging to identify degraded areas at the module scale. Small samples were then removed from degraded areas, laser marked, and imaged by scanning electron microscopy. We used simultaneous electron-beam induced current imaging and focused ion beam milling to mark around PID shunts for chemical analysis by time-of-flight secondary-ion mass spectrometry or to isolate individual shunt defects for transmission electron microscopy and atom-probe tomography analysis. By spanning a range of 10 orders of magnitude in size, this approach enabled us to investigate the root-cause mechanisms for PID shunting. We observed a direct correlation between recombination active shunts and sodium content. The sodium content in shunted areas peaks at the SiNX/Si interface and is consistently observed at a concentration of 0.1% to 2% in shunted areas. Analysis of samples subjected to PID recovery, either activated by electron beam or thermal effects only, reveals that recovery of isolated shunts correlates with diffusion of sodium out of the structural defects to the silicon surface. We observed the role of oxygen and chlorine in PID shunting and found that those species - although sometimes present in structural defects where PID shunting was observed - do not play a consistent role in PID shunting.","Wiley","","National Renewable Energy Lab.

III-V semiconductors offer tunable bandgap and unparalleled efficiencies for tandem devices. However, their high manufacturing cost has been the biggest impediment for market entry. Hydride vapor phase epitaxy (HVPE) has recently reemerged as a promising low-cost alternative to incumbent metalorganic chemical vapor deposition (MOCVD) for III-V solar cells. Here, we show the first demonstration of ~1.7 eV GaInAsP solar cells that achieve nearly 19% photoconversion efficiency synthesized by HVPE. The unprecedented growth rate of ~42 um/h achieved via HVPE (~10x faster than conventional MOCVD) allowed the device layers to be deposited in less than seven minutes. Nearly abrupt and chemically distinct heterointerfaces were attained in spite of high-growth rates, which are known to exacerbate phase separation in GaInAsP alloys. Demonstration of ideality factor of n=1 at max power point highlight the advancements in growth optimization and device design.

Thus, it may play an important role in the future, especially to balance fluctuating sources in increasingly renewables-based power systems. Today, its costs are higher than those of PV and wind power and, as most countries do not support CSP, deployment is slow. Unless the expansion gains pace and costs decrease, the industry may stagnate or collapse, and an important technology for climate change mitigation has been lost. Keeping CSP as a maturing technology for dispatchable renewable power thus requires measures to improve its short-term economic attractiveness and to continue reducing costs in the longer term. We suggest a set of three policy instruments - feed-in tariffs or auctions reflecting the value of dispatchable CSP, and not merely its cost; risk coverage support for innovative designs; and demonstration projects - to be deployed, in regions where CSP has a potentially large role to play. This could provide the CSP industry with a balance of attractive profits and competitive pressure, the incentive to expand CSP while also reducing its costs, making it ready for broad-scale deployment when it is needed.","Elsevier","","National Renewable Energy Lab.

However, the existing literature only highlights optimized bifacial PV for a few geographic locations or develops worldwide performance maps for very specific configurations, such as the vertical installation. It is still difficult to translate these location- and configuration-specific conclusions to a general optimized performance of this technology. In this paper, we present a global study and optimization of bifacial solar modules using a rigorous and comprehensive modeling framework. Our results demonstrate that with a low albedo of 0.25, the bifacial gain of ground-mounted bifacial modules is less than 10% worldwide. However, increasing the albedo to 0.5 and elevating modules 1 m above the ground can boost the bifacial gain to 30%. Moreover, we derive a set of empirical design rules, which optimize bifacial solar modules across the world and provide the groundwork for rapid assessment of the location-specific performance. We find that ground-mounted, vertical, east-west-facing bifacial modules will outperform their south-north-facing, optimally tilted counterparts by up to 15% below the latitude of 30 degrees, for an albedo of 0.5. The relative energy output is reversed in latitudes above 30 degrees.

This national estimate is based on an analysis of select US cities that combines light detection and ranging (lidar) data with a validated analytical method for determining rooftop PV suitability employing geographic information systems. We use statistical models to extend this analysis to estimate the quantity and characteristics of roofs in areas not covered by lidar data. Finally, we model PV generation for all rooftops to yield technical potential estimates. At the national level, 8.13 billion m<sup>2</sup> of suitable roof area could host 1118 GW of PV capacity, generating 1432 TWh of electricity per year. This would equate to 38.6% of the electricity that was sold in the contiguous United States in 2013. This estimate is substantially higher than a previous estimate made by the National Renewable Energy Laboratory. The difference can be attributed to increases in PV module power density, improved estimation of building suitability, higher estimates of total number of buildings, and improvements in PV performance simulation tools that previously tended to underestimate productivity. Also notable, the nationwide percentage of buildings suitable for at least some PV deployment is high—82% for buildings smaller than 5000 ft<sup>2</sup> and over 99% for buildings larger than that. In most states, rooftop PV could enable small, mostly residential buildings to offset the majority of average household electricity consumption. Even in some states with a relatively poor solar resource, such as those in the Northeast, the residential sector has the potential to offset around 100% of its total electricity consumption with rooftop PV.","IOP Publishing","","National Renewable Energy Lab.

In this paper, backsheet degradation of modules with one of these new types of backsheets (polyethylene naphthalate (PEN)-based) was documented at a four-year old utility-scale array located in Maryland (USA). Visual inspection, colorimetry, glossimetry, and Fourier-transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR) revealed highly varied properties depending on module position within the array. Specifically, modules near the edge of the array and with higher mounting elevations underwent greater amounts of backsheet degradation, as indicated by yellowing and gloss-loss. The reason for these unique degradation patterns were differential backside exposure conditions, especially of ultraviolet light. This was strongly influenced by the array design, including array structural and environmental factors, such as module spacing and ground cover, respectively. Within the array, no clear link between backsheet degradation and module output or safety has been identified. However, such a relationship may be expected to become more pronounced with time, affecting system lifetime and ultimately the levelized cost of electricity (LCOE).

Acceptors comprising single or multiple linked chromophores have been used. We have developed a new non-fullerene molecular acceptor as well as two non-polymeric macromolecular materials that contain four equivalents of a similar chromophore, but can adopt different spatial arrangements of the chromophores. We compare the effect of having single and multiple chromophores within a macromolecule on the charge generation processes in P3HT:non-fullerene acceptor BHJ films using Transient Absorption Spectroscopy (TAS) and Time Resolved Microwave Conductivity (TRMC) measurements. It was found from the TAS measurements that at low weight percent (5 wt%) the single chromophore formed more polarons than the acceptors in which chromophores were linked, due to it having a more even distribution within the film. At higher concentrations (50 wt%) the trend was reversed due to the single chromophore forming crystalline domains, which reduced the interface area with the P3HT donor. The TRMC measurements showed that more mobile carriers were formed in the macromolecular acceptors when used at low concentrations in the blend and, independent of concentration, mobile carriers had a longer lifetime when compared to films containing the molecular material, which we ascribe to the charges being able to sample more than one chromophore and thus reduce recombination events.","Elsevier","","National Renewable Energy Lab.

Some of these layers, particularly 'buffers,' which are deposited directly on top of the absorber, exhibit metastable effects upon exposure to light. Thus, to understand device performance and/or metastability, it is sometimes desirable to selectively excite different layers in the device stack. Absorption characteristics of various window and buffer layers used in chalcopyrite devices are measured. These characteristics are compared with emission spectra of common and available light sources that might be used to optically excite such layers. Effects of the window and buffer absorption on device quantum efficiency and metastability are discussed. For the case of bath-deposited Zn(O,S) buffers, we conclude that this layer is not optically excited in research devices or modules. Furthermore, this provides a complimentary mechanism to the chemical differences that may cause long time constants (compared to devices with CdS buffers) associated with reaching a stable 'light-soaked' state.","Elsevier","","National Renewable Energy Lab.

Demonstrated spall depths of 7-60 um using DC sputtering to deposit the stressor layer are appropriate for the latter application but spall depths < 5 um may be required to minimize waste for device applications. This work investigates the effect of tuning both electroplating current density and electrolyte chemistry on the residual stress in the nickel and on the achievable spall depth range for the Ni/Ge system as a lower-cost, higher-throughput alternative to sputtering. By tuning current density and electrolyte phosphorous concentration, it is shown that electroplating can successfully span the same range of spalled thicknesses as has previously been demonstrated by sputtering and can reach sufficiently high stresses to enter a regime of thickness (<7 um) appropriate to minimize substrate consumption for device applications.","Elsevier","","National Renewable Energy Lab.

The tandem cell consists of a 1.7 eV GaInAsP top-junction grown lattice-matched to a GaAs substrate, followed by a metamorphic 1.1 eV GaInAs junction grown on a transparent, compositionally graded metamorphic AlGaInAs buffer. This bandgap combination is much closer to the dual-junction optimum and offers headroom for absolute 3% improvement in efficiency, in comparison to the incumbent lattice-matched GaInP/GaAs (~1.86/1.41 eV) solar cells. The challenge of growing a high-quality 1.7 eV GaInAsP solar cell is the propensity for phase separation in the GaInAsP alloy. The challenge of lattice-mismatched GaInAs solar cell growth is that it requires minimizing the residual dislocation density during the growth of a transparent compositionally graded buffer to enable efficient metamorphic tandem cell integration. Transmission electron microscopy reveals relatively weak composition fluctuation present in the 1.7 eV GaInAsP alloy, attained through growth control. The threading dislocation density of the GaInAs junction is ~1 x 10^6 cm-2, as determined from cathodoluminescence measurements, highlighting the quality of the graded buffer. These material advances have enabled the performance of both junctions to reach over 80% of their Shockley-Queisser limiting efficiencies, with both the subcells demonstrating a bandgap-voltage offset, WOC (=Eg/q-VOC), of ~0.39 V.","American Institute of Physics (AIP)","","National Renewable Energy Lab.

K.","14 SOLAR ENERGY; 71 CLASSICAL AND QUANTUM MECHANICS, GENERAL PHYSICS; CdTe; diffusion; doping; DFT","Fundamental material doping challenges have limited CdTe electro-optical applications. In this work, the As atomistic diffusion mechanisms in CdTe are examined by spatially resolving dopant incorporation in both single-crystalline and polycrystalline CdTe over a range of experimental conditions. Density-functional theory calculations predict experimental activation energies and indicate As diffuses slowly through the Te sublattice and quickly along GBs similar to Sb. Because of its atomic size and associated defect chemistry, As does not have a fast interstitial diffusion component similar to P. Experiments to incorporate and activate P, As, and Sb in polycrystalline CdTe are conducted to examine if ex-situ Group V doping can overcome historic polycrystalline doping limits. The distinct P, As, and Sb diffusion characteristics create different strategies for increasing hole density. Because fast interstitial diffusion is prominent for P, less aggressive diffusion conditions followed by Cd overpressure to relocate the Group V element to the Te lattice site is effective. For larger atoms, slower diffusion through the Te sublattice requires more aggressive diffusion, however further activation is not always necessary. Based on the new physical understanding, we have obtained greater than 10^16 cm^-3 hole density in polycrystalline CdTe films by As and P diffusion.","IOP Publishing","","National Renewable Energy Lab.

"High growth rate hydride vapor phase epitaxy at low temperature through use of uncracked hydrides","Schulte, Kevin L.; Braun, Anna; Simon, John; Ptak, Aaron J.","14 SOLAR ENERGY; 71 CLASSICAL AND QUANTUM MECHANICS, GENERAL PHYSICS; chemical compounds; epitaxy; semiconductors; heterojunctions; electrical properties","We demonstrate hydride vapor phase epitaxy (HVPE) of GaAs with unusually high growth rates (RG) at low temperature and atmospheric pressure by employing a hydride-enhanced growth mechanism. Under traditional HVPE growth conditions that involve growth from Asx species, RG exhibits a strong temperature dependence due to slow kinetics at the surface, and growth temperatures >750 degrees C are required to obtain RG > 60 um/h. We demonstrate that when the group V element reaches the surface in a hydride, the kinetic barrier is dramatically reduced and surface kinetics no longer limit RG. In this regime, RG is dependent on mass transport of uncracked AsH3 to the surface. By controlling the AsH3 velocity and temperature profile of the reactor, which both affect the degree of AsH3 decomposition, we demonstrate tuning of RG. We achieve RG above 60 um/h at temperatures as low as 560 degrees C and up to 110 um/h at 650 degrees C. We incorporate high-RG GaAs into solar cell devices to verify that the electronic quality does not deteriorate as RG is increased. The open circuit voltage (VOC), which is a strong function of non-radiative recombination in the bulk material, exhibits negligible variance in a series of devices grown at 650 degrees C with RG = 55-110 um/h. The implications of low temperature growth for the formation of complex heterostructure devices by HVPE are discussed.","American Institute of Physics (AIP)","","National Renewable Energy Lab.

"Comparing supply and demand models for future photovoltaic power generation in the USA","Basore, Paul A.; Cole, Wesley J.","14 SOLAR ENERGY; 29 ENERGY PLANNING, POLICY, AND ECONOMY; deployment; future; modeling; photovoltaics","We explore the plausible range of future deployment of photovoltaic generation capacity in the USA using a supply-focused model based on supply-chain growth constraints and a demand-focused model based on minimizing the overall cost of the electricity system. Both approaches require assumptions based on previous experience and anticipated trends. For each of the models, we assign plausible ranges for the key assumptions and then compare the resulting PV deployment over time. Each model was applied to 2 different future scenarios: one in which PV market penetration is ultimately constrained by the uncontrolled variability of solar power and one in which low-cost energy storage or some equivalent measure largely alleviates this constraint. The supply-focused and demand-focused models are in substantial agreement, not just in the long term, where deployment is largely determined by the assumed market penetration constraints, but also in the interim years. For the future scenario without low-cost energy storage or equivalent measures, the 2 models give an average plausible range of PV generation capacity in the USA of 150 to 530 GWdc in 2030 and 260 to 810 GWdc in 2040. With low-cost energy storage or equivalent measures, the corresponding ranges are 160 to 630 GWdc in 2030 and 280 to 1200 GWdc in 2040. The latter range is enough to supply 10% to 40% of US electricity demand in 2040, based on current demand growth.","Wiley","","National Renewable Energy Lab.

Recent efficiency gains have come partly from shifting from the traditional CdS window layer to new materials such as CdSe and MgZnO, yet substantial headroom still exists to improve performance. Thin film technologies including Cu(In,Ga)Se2, perovskites, Cu2ZnSn(S,Se)4, and CdTe inherently have many grain boundaries that can form recombination centers and impede carrier transport; however, grain boundary engineering has been difficult and not practical. In this work, it is demonstrated that wide columnar grains reaching through the entire CdTe layer can be achieved by aggressive postdeposition CdTe recrystallization. This reduces the grain structure constraints imposed by nucleation on nanocrystalline window layers and enables diverse window layers to be selected for other properties critical for electro-optical applications. Computational simulations indicate that increasing grain size from 1 to 7 um can be equivalent to decreasing grain-boundary recombination velocity by three orders of magnitude.

For the most efficient polycrystalline absorbers, Na and K in the Cu(In,Ga)(Se,S)<sub>2</sub> (CIGS) absorber often benefit performance, so a more detailed mechanism for PID is needed. To that end, CIGS solar cells have been encapsulated, stressed with high voltage, and cored to extract the active regions for characterization. SLG substrates led to 14.9% efficiency on average, which reduced to 0% after 25 h of -1000 V bias. This was accompanied by increased Na in the CIGS layer, particularly at the buffer interface, as well as decreased carrier concentrations. On the other hand, borosilicate glass substrates with low Na and high K content led to 13.6% efficiency on average, which only reduced to 12.1% after 25 h of stress. This was accompanied by slightly increased K content in the CIGS layer. As K has led to recent world record efficiency CIGS devices, understanding Na and K similarities and differences may help to enhance initial efficiency and reduce PID.","IEEE","","National Renewable Energy Lab.

In this work, an uncertainty analysis of the SMR approach is performed based on a dataset of spectral irradiances created with SMARTS2. Using these illumination spectra, the respective efficiencies of multijunction solar cells with different cell architectures are calculated. These efficiencies were used to analyze the influence of different component cell sensors and SMR filtering methods. The 3 main findings of this work are as follows. First, component cells based on the lattice-matched triple-junction (LM3J) cell are suitable for restricting spectral conditions and are qualified for the standardized power rating of CPV modules - even if the CPV module is using multijunction cells other than LM3J. Second, a filtering of all 3 SMRs with +/-3.0% of unity results in the worst case scenario in an underestimation of -1.7% and overestimation of +2.4% compared to AM1.5d efficiency. Third, there is no benefit in matching the component cells to the module cell in respect to the measurement uncertainty.","","","National Renewable Energy Lab.

In addition to batteries, load control technologies can reshape customer load profiles to optimize PV system use. The combination of PV, energy storage, and load control provides an integrated approach to PV deployment, which we call 'solar plus'. The U.S. National Renewable Energy Laboratory's Renewable Energy Optimization (REopt) model is utilized to evaluate cost-optimal technology selection, sizing, and dispatch in residential buildings under a variety of rate structures and locations. The REopt model is extended to include a controllable or 'smart' domestic hot water heater model and smart air conditioner model. We find that the solar plus approach improves end user economics across a variety of rate structures - especially those that are challenging for PV - including lower grid export rates, non-coincident time-of-use structures, and demand charges.","Elsevier","","National Renewable Energy Lab.

"System Dynamics of Polysilicon for Solar Photovoltaics: A Framework for Investigating the Energy Security of Renewable Energy Supply Chains","Sandor, Debra; Fulton, Sadie; Engel-Cox, Jill; Peck, Corey; Peterson, Steve","14 SOLAR ENERGY; 29 ENERGY PLANNING, POLICY, AND ECONOMY; photovoltaic; polysilicon; trade; energy security; advanced manufacturing","Renewable energy, produced with widely available low-cost energy resources, is often included as a component of national strategies to address energy security and sustainability. Market and political forces cannot disrupt the sun or wind, unlike oil and gas supplies. However, the cost of renewable energy is highly dependent on technologies manufactured through global supply chains in leading manufacturing countries. The countries that contribute to the global supply chains may take actions that, directly or indirectly, influence global access to materials and components. For example, high-purity polysilicon, a key material in solar photovoltaics, has experienced significant price fluctuations, affecting the manufacturing capacity and cost of both polysilicon and solar panels. This study has developed and validated an initial system dynamics framework to gain insights into global trade in polysilicon. The model represents an initial framework for exploration. Three regions were modeled-China, the United States, and the rest of the world - for a range of trade scenarios to understand the impacts of import duties and non-price drivers on the relative volumes of imports and domestic supply. The model was validated with the historical case of China imposing an import duty on polysilicon from the United States, the European Union, and South Korea, which altered the regional flows of polysilicon - in terms of imports, exports, and domestic production-to varying degrees. As expected, the model tracked how regional demand shares and influx volumes decrease as a duty on a region increases. Using 2016 as a reference point, in the scenarios examined for U.S. exports to China, each 10% increase in the import duty results in a 40% decrease in import volume. The model also indicates that, under the scenarios investigated, once a duty has been imposed on a region, the demand share from that region declines and does not achieve pre-duty levels, even as global demand increases. Adding additional countries and other components in the photovoltaic supply chain (panels, cells, wafers) to this model could enable policymakers to better understand the relative impact of trade measures across the entire photovoltaic module manufacturing supply chain and the conditions that encourage industry evolution and competitiveness.","MDPI","","National Renewable Energy Lab.

The attempt to describe the R(T) characteristic solely by thermionic emission of charge carriers across an energy barrier leads to a significant underestimation of the resistance by several orders of magnitude. However, the data can be described properly with the metal-insulator-semiconductor (MIS) theory if tunneling of charge carriers through the silicon oxide layer is taken into account. Furthermore, temperature-dependent light J-V characteristics of solar cells featuring passivating contacts at the rear revealed a FF drop at T < 205 K, which is near the onset temperature of the exponential increase in contact resistivity.","Elsevier","","National Renewable Energy Lab.

Dry heating under light irradiation improves the conversion efficiency of CIGS solar cells at the early stage, which slightly decreases after long-term testing. However, after dry heating in the dark, the conversion efficiency significantly decreases. The net acceptor concentration considerably decreases after dark heating, and the reduction in the number of metastable acceptors results in decreases in open-circuit voltage and fill factor. After heat illumination treatment, the net acceptor concentration increases because of the metastable acceptors in CIGS layers, and the open-circuit voltage and fill factor partly recover. Therefore, the concentrations of metastable acceptors should be controlled by light irradiation or current injection with positive bias to evaluate correctly the degradation rates during accelerated lifetime testing.","Japan Society of Applied Physics","","National Renewable Energy Lab.

To achieve this objective, the first step is to be able to access small samples from specific areas of the solar panels without changing the properties of the material. In this paper, we describe two coring procedures that we developed and applied to Si, CIGS, and CdTe solar panels. In the first procedure, we cored full samples, whereas in the second we performed a partial coring that keeps the tempered glass intact. The cored samples were analyzed by different analytical techniques before and after coring, at the same locations, and no damage during the coring procedure was observed.","Elsevier","","National Renewable Energy Lab.

Two voltage optimization algorithms are developed to evaluate the CVR benefit by considering two types of smart inverter functions: aggregated reactive power control and autonomous volt/VAR control. In each algorithm, smart inverters are coordinately controlled with the operation of legacy voltage regulating devices including load tap changers and capacitor banks. Both algorithms are tested on representative utility distribution system models. In conclusion, simulation results demonstrate that the proposed algorithms can achieve around 1.8-3.6% energy savings when only using legacy voltage regulating devices and an additional 0.3-0.9% when adding smart inverters.","IEEE","","National Renewable Energy Lab.

To further improve device performance, it is imperative to obtain fundamental understandings on the photo-response and long-term stability down to the microscopic level. Here, we report the quantitative nanoscale photoconductivity imaging on two methylammonium lead triiodide thin films with different efficiencies by light-stimulated microwave impedance microscopy. The microwave signals are largely uniform across grains and grain boundaries, suggesting that microstructures do not lead to strong spatial variations of the intrinsic photo-response. In contrast, the measured photoconductivity and lifetime are strongly affected by bulk properties such as the sample crystallinity. As visualized by the spatial evolution of local photoconductivity, the degradation process begins with the disintegration of grains rather than nucleation and propagation from visible boundaries between grains. In conclusion, our findings provide insights to improve the electro-optical properties of perovskite thin films towards large-scale commercialization.","Nature Publishing Group","","National Renewable Energy Lab.

First, EL images are corrected for camera- and perspective distortion. The relative power loss map is then calculated from the logarithmic ratio of two EL images, taken either before and after PID degradation or at different applied currents. Only the cell average of the resulting power loss map is evaluated. The highest power loss across each string is averaged to obtain the overall power loss. Consequently, for modules with three strings, three cells are averaged. The resulting power loss depends on the current applied. The conversion to equivalent irradiance allows for comparison of measured and estimated device performance. The analysis of roughly 2000 EL images and related current-voltage (I-V) curves indicates a good agreement between flash-test-measured and performance estimated using QELA. A relative root mean square error of 1-3% can be achieved.","IEEE","","National Renewable Energy Lab.

During singlet fission, a high energy spin-singlet state in an organic semiconductor divides its energy to form two lower energy spin-triplet excitations on neighboring chromophores. While key insights into mechanisms leading to singlet fission have been gained recently, developing photostable compounds that undergo quantitative singlet fission remains a key challenge. In this report, we explore triplet exciton production via singlet fission in films of perylenediimides, a class of compounds with a long history of use as industrial dyes and pigments due to their photostability. As singlet fission necessitates electron transfer between neighboring molecules, its rate and yield depend sensitively on their local arrangement. Here, by adding different functional groups at their imide positions, we control how perylenediimides pack in the solid state.","American Chemical Society (ACS)","","National Renewable Energy Lab.

"Image phase shift invariance based cloud motion displacement vector calculation method for ultra-short-term solar PV power forecasting","Wang, Fei; Zhen, Zhao; Liu, Chun; Mi, Zengqiang; Hodge, Bri-Mathias; Shafie-khah, Miadreza; Catalao, Joao P. S.","14 SOLAR ENERGY; 24 POWER TRANSMISSION AND DISTRIBUTION; phase correlation; Fourier transform; cloud motion displacement vector; sky image; solar forecasting","Irradiance received on the earth's surface is the main factor that affects the output power of solar PV plants, and is chiefly determined by the cloud distribution seen in a ground-based sky image at the corresponding moment in time. It is the foundation for those linear extrapolation-based ultra-short-term solar PV power forecasting approaches to obtain the cloud distribution in future sky images from the accurate calculation of cloud motion displacement vectors (CMDVs) by using historical sky images. Theoretically, the CMDV can be obtained from the coordinate of the peak pulse calculated from a Fourier phase correlation theory (FPCT) method through the frequency domain information of sky images. The peak pulse is significant and unique only when the cloud deformation between two consecutive sky images is slight enough, which is likely possible for a very short time interval (such as 1?min or shorter) with common changes in the speed of cloud. Sometimes, there will be more than one pulse with similar values when the deformation of the clouds between two consecutive sky images is comparatively obvious under fast changing cloud speeds. This would probably lead to significant errors if the CMDVs were still only obtained from the single coordinate of the peak value pulse. However, the deformation estimation of clouds between two images and its influence on FPCT-based CMDV calculations are terrifically complex and difficult because the motion of clouds is complicated to describe and model. Therefore, to improve the accuracy and reliability under these circumstances in a simple manner, an image-phase-shift-invariance (IPSI) based CMDV calculation method using FPCT is proposed for minute time scale solar power forecasting. First, multiple different CMDVs are calculated from the corresponding consecutive images pairs obtained through different synchronous rotation angles compared to the original images by using the FPCT method. Second, the final CMDV is generated from all of the calculated CMDVs through a centroid iteration strategy based on its density and distance distribution. Third, the influence of different rotation angle resolution on the final CMDV is analyzed as a means of parameter estimation. Simulations under various scenarios including both thick and thin clouds conditions indicated that the proposed IPSI-based CMDV calculation method using FPCT is more accurate and reliable than the original FPCT method, optimal flow (OF) method, and particle image velocimetry (PIV) method.","Elsevier","","National Renewable Energy Lab.

"Identification of the limiting factors for high-temperature GaAs, GaInP, and AlGaInP solar cells from device and carrier lifetime analysis","Perl, E. E.; Kuciauskas, D.; Simon, J.; Friedman, D. J.; Steiner, M. A.","14 SOLAR ENERGY; 71 CLASSICAL AND QUANTUM MECHANICS, GENERAL PHYSICS; semiconductors; electric currents; thermionic emission; electrical properties; solar cells","We analyze the temperature-dependent dark saturation current density and open-circuit voltage (VOC) for GaAs, GaInP, and AlGaInP solar cells from 25 to 400 degrees C. As expected, the intrinsic carrier concentration, ni, dominates the temperature dependence of the dark currents. However, at 400 degrees C, we measure VOC that is ~50 mV higher for the GaAs solar cell and ~60-110 mV lower for the GaInP and AlGaInP solar cells compared to what would be expected from commonly used solar cell models that consider only the ni2 temperature dependence. To better understand these deviations, we measure the carrier lifetimes of p-type GaAs, GaInP, and AlGaInP double heterostructures (DHs) from 25 to 400 degrees C using time-resolved photoluminescence. Temperature-dependent minority carrier lifetimes are analyzed to determine the relative contributions of the radiative recombination, interface recombination, Shockley-Read-Hall recombination, and thermionic emission processes. We find that radiative recombination dominates for the GaAs DHs with the effective lifetime approximately doubling as the temperature is increased from 25 degrees C to 400 degrees C. In contrast, we find that thermionic emission dominates for the GaInP and AlGaInP DHs at elevated temperatures, leading to a 3-4x reduction in the effective lifetime and ~40x increase in the surface recombination velocity as the temperature is increased from 25 degrees C to 400 degrees C. These observations suggest that optimization of the minority carrier confinement layers for the GaInP and AlGaInP solar cells could help to improve VOC and solar cell efficiency at elevated temperatures. We demonstrate VOC improvement at 200-400 degrees C in GaInP solar cells fabricated with modified AlGaInP window and back surface field layers.","American Institute of Physics (AIP)","","National Renewable Energy Lab.

CM is of interest to enhance the efficiency of a solar cell. Until now, CM in thin films and solar cells of semiconductor nanocrystals (NCs) has been found at photon energies well above the minimum required energy of twice the band gap. The high threshold of CM strongly limits the benefits for solar cell applications. We show that CM is more efficient in a percolative network of directly connected PbSe NCs. The CM threshold is at twice the band gap and increases in a steplike fashion with photon energy. A lower CM efficiency is found for a solid of weaker coupled NCs. This demonstrates that the coupling between NCs strongly affects the CM efficiency. According to device simulations, the measured CM efficiency would significantly enhance the power conversion efficiency of a solar cell.","American Chemical Society (ACS)","","National Renewable Energy Lab.

However, the question of how this spatial constraint impacts the active material is rarely addressed, although it may have a drastic influence on the phase behavior and microstructure of the active layer and hence the final performance. Here, the small-molecule semiconductor p-DTS(FBTTh<sub>2</sub>)<sub>2</sub> is used as a model system to illustrate how sensitive this class of material can be to spatial confinement on device-relevant length scales. It is also shown that this effect can be exploited; it is demonstrated, for instance, that spatial confinement is an efficient tool to direct the crystal orientation and overall texture of p-DTS(FBTTh<sub>2</sub>)<sub>2</sub> structures in a controlled manner, allowing for the manipulation of properties including photoluminescence and charge transport characteristics. This insight should be widely applicable as the temperature/confinement phase diagrams established via differential scanning calorimetry and grazing-incidence X-ray diffraction are used to identify specific processing routes that can be directly extrapolated to other functional organic materials, such as polymeric semiconductors, ferroelectrics or high-refractive-index polymers, to induce desired crystal textures or specific (potentially new) polymorphs.","Wiley","","National Renewable Energy Lab.

Further cost reductions are expected to enable substantially greater solar deployment, and new Department of Energy cost targets for utility-scale photovoltaics (PV) and concentrating solar thermal power are $0.03/kW h and $0.05/kW h by 2030, respectively. However, cost reductions are no longer the only significant challenge for PV - addressing grid integration challenges and increasing grid flexibility are critical as the penetration of PV electricity on the grid increases. The development of low cost energy storage is particularly synergistic with low cost PV, as cost declines in each technology are expected to support greater market opportunities for the other.","Materials Research Society - Cambridge University Press","","National Renewable Energy Lab.

Here, we describe and validate a method for estimating soiling loss experienced by PV systems directly from system yield without the need for precipitation data. The method, termed the stochastic rate and recovery (SRR) method, automatically detects soiling intervals in a dataset, then stochastically generates a sample of possible soiling profiles based on the observed characteristics of each interval. In this paper, we describe the method, validate it against soiling station measurements, and compare it with other PV-yield-based soiling estimation methods. The broader application of the SRR method will enable the fleet scale assessment of soiling loss to facilitate mitigation planning and risk assessment.","IEEE","","National Renewable Energy Lab.

Partial shading can cause permanent damage in the form of 'wormlike' defects on thin-film modules due to thermal runaway. This results in module-scale power losses. We have used dark lock-in thermography (DLIT) to spatially observe localized heating when reverse-bias breakdown occurs on various CIGS mini-modules. For better understanding of how and where these defects originated and propagated, we have developed techniques where the current is limited during reverse-bias stressing. This allows for DLIT-based detection and detailed studying of the region where breakdown is initiated before thermal runaway leads to permanent damage. Statistics of breakdown sites using current-limited conditions has allowed for reasonable identification of the as-grown defects where permanent breakdown will likely originate. Scanning electron microscope results and wormlike defect analysis show that breakdown originates in defects such as small pits, craters, or cracks in the CIGS layer, and the wormlike defects propagate near the top CIGS interface.","Elsevier","","National Renewable Energy Lab.

This has included debate about the cost associated with integrating these generators onto the electric grid. For photovoltaics (PV), this encompasses costs incurred on both the bulk power and distribution systems, as well as the value provided to them. These costs and benefits, in particular those associated with integrating PV onto the distribution system, are not well understood. We seek to advance the state of understanding of 'grid integration costs' for the distribution system by reviewing prior literature and outlining a transparent, bottom-up approach that can be used to calculate these costs. We provide a clear delineation of costs to integrate PV in to the distribution system within the larger context of total costs and benefits associated with PV generators. We emphasize that these costs are situationally dependent, and that a single 'cost of integration' cannot be obtained. We additionally emphasize that benefits must be considered when evaluating the competitiveness of the technology in a given situation.","Elsevier","","National Renewable Energy Lab.

We analyze the potential impacts of achieving these 'SunShot 2030' cost targets for the contiguous United States using the Regional Energy Deployment System (ReEDS) and Distributed Generation (dGen) capacity expansion models. We consider the impacts under a wide range of future conditions. We find that PV could provide 13%-18% of U.S. electricity demand in 2030 and 28%-64% of demand if the SunShot 2030 goals are achieved, with PV deployment increasing in every state. The availability of low-cost storage has the largest impact on projected deployment, followed by natural gas prices and electricity demand. For comparison, PV deployed under a business-as-usual scenario could provide only 5% of generation in 2030 and 17% in 2050. We find that the high levels of PV deployment explored here lead to lower electricity prices and system costs, lower carbon dioxide emissions, lower water consumption, increased renewable energy curtailment, and increased storage deployment compared with the business-as-usual scenario.","Elsevier","","National Renewable Energy Lab.

Herein, we report on the properties of arsenic doped CdTe single crystals grown from Cd solvent by the travelling heater method. The photoluminescence spectra and activation energy of 74 +/- 2 meV derived from the temperature-dependent Hall effect are consistent with AsTe as the dominant acceptor. Doping in the 10^16 to 10^17/cm^3 range is achieved for measured As concentrations between 10^16 and 10^20/cm^3 with the highest doping efficiency of 40% occurring near 10^17 As/cm^3. We observe persistent photoconductivity, a hallmark of light-induced metastable configuration changes consistent with AX behavior. Additionally, quenching experiments reveal at least two mechanisms of increased p-type doping in the dark, one decaying over 2-3 weeks and the other persisting for at least 2 months. These results provide essential insights for the application of As-doped CdTe in thin film solar cells.","American Institute of Physics (AIP)","","National Renewable Energy Lab.

"Short-term solar irradiance forecasting via satellite/model coupling","Miller, Steven D.; Rogers, Matthew A.; Haynes, John M.; Sengupta, Manajit; Heidinger, Andrew K.","14 SOLAR ENERGY; 47 OTHER INSTRUMENTATION; geostationary satellite; cloud properties; parallax; shadows; advection; solar irradiance","Here, the short-term (0-3 h) prediction of solar insolation for renewable energy production is a problem well-suited to satellite-based techniques. The spatial, spectral, temporal and radiometric resolution of instrumentation hosted on the geostationary platform allows these satellites to describe the current cloud spatial distribution and optical properties. These properties relate directly to the transient properties of the downwelling solar irradiance at the surface, which come in the form of 'ramps' that pose a central challenge to energy load balancing in a spatially distributed network of solar farms. The short-term evolution of the cloud field may be approximated to first order simply as translational, but care must be taken in how the advection is handled and where the impacts are assigned. In this research, we describe how geostationary satellite observations are used with operational cloud masking and retrieval algorithms, wind field data from Numerical Weather Prediction (NWP), and radiative transfer calculations to produce short-term forecasts of solar insolation for applications in solar power generation. The scheme utilizes retrieved cloud properties to group pixels into contiguous cloud objects whose future positions are predicted using four-dimensional (space + time) model wind fields, selecting steering levels corresponding to the cloud height properties of each cloud group. The shadows associated with these clouds are adjusted for sensor viewing parallax displacement and combined with solar geometry and terrain height to determine the actual location of cloud shadows. For mid/high-level clouds at mid-latitudes and high solar zenith angles, the combined displacements from these geometric considerations are non-negligible. The cloud information is used to initialize a radiative transfer model that computes the direct and diffuse-sky solar insolation at both shadow locations and intervening clear-sky regions. Here, we describe the formulation of the algorithm and validate its performance against Surface Radiation (SURFRAD; Augustine et al., 2000, 2005) network observations. Typical errors range from 8.5% to 17.2% depending on the complexity of cloud regimes, and an operational demonstration outperformed persistence-based forecasting of Global Horizontal Irradiance (GHI) under all conditions by ~10 W/m<sup>2</sup>.","Elsevier","","National Renewable Energy Lab.

In this work, we combine the benefits of smart windows with energy conversion by producing a photovoltaic device with a switchable absorber layer that dynamically responds to sunlight. Upon illumination, photothermal heating switches the absorber layer - composed of a metal halide perovskite-methylamine complex - from a transparent state (68% visible transmittance) to an absorbing, photovoltaic colored state (less than 3% visible transmittance) due to dissociation of methylamine. After cooling, the methylamine complex is re-formed, returning the absorber layer to the transparent state in which the device acts as a window to visible light. The thermodynamics of switching and performance of the device are described. In conclusion, this work validates a photovoltaic window technology that circumvents the fundamental tradeoff between efficient solar conversion and high visible light transmittance that limits conventional semitransparent PV window designs.","Nature Publishing Group","","National Renewable Energy Lab.

This paper exploits current grid resources and explores energy storage for primary frequency response under high PV penetration at the interconnection level. Based on the actual models of the U.S. Eastern Interconnection grid and the Texas grid, effects of multiple factors associated with primary frequency response, including the governor ratio, governor deadband, droop rate, and fast load response, are assessed under high PV penetration scenarios. In addition, performance of batteries and supercapacitors using different control strategies is studied in the two interconnections.

The ionization potential and electron affinity for this material (4.98 and 3.43 eV) are lower than those for other common absorbers, including CuInxGa<sub>(1-x)</sub>Se<sub>2</sub> (CIGS). Experimentally corroborated density functional theory (DFT) calculations show that the valence band maximum is raised by the lone pair electrons from the antimony cations contributing additional states when compared with indium or gallium cations in CIGS. The resulting conduction band misalignment with CdS is a reason for the poor performance of cells incorporating a CAS/CdS heterojunction, supporting the idea that using a cell design analogous to CIGS is unhelpful. These findings underline the critical importance of considering the electronic structure when selecting cell architectures that optimize open-circuit voltages and cell efficiencies.","American Chemical Society (ACS)","","National Renewable Energy Lab.

The incorporation of a small amount of Rb<sup>+</sup> (x = 0.05) increases both the open circuit voltage (V<sub>oc</sub>) and the short circuit photocurrent density (J<sub>sc</sub>) of the PSCs, leading to an improved power conversion efficiency (PCE). However, a high fraction of Rb<sup>+</sup> incorporation (x = 0.1 and 0.2) decreases the J<sub>sc</sub> and thus the PCE, which is attributed to the phase segregation of the single tetragonal perovskite phase to a MA-rich tetragonal perovskite phase and a RbPbI<sub>3</sub> orthorhombic phase at high Rb fractions. Conductive atomic force microscopic and admittance spectroscopic analyses reveal that the single-phase (Rb<sub>0.05</sub>MA<sub>0.95</sub>)PbI<sub>3</sub> film has a high electrical conductivity because of a reduced deep-level trap density.

In this paper, we use the frequency dependence of inphase and quadrature components of modulated electroluminescence (MEL) to measure the relaxation time (decay) of excess carriers. The advantage of the MEL technique is that the relaxation time is obtained directly from the angular frequency at which the quadrature component peaks. It does not need knowledge of the material parameters like mobility, etc., and can be used for any finished solar cells which have detectable light emission. The experiment is easy to perform with standard electrical equipment. For silicon solar cells, the relaxation time is dominated by recombination and hence, the relaxation time is indeed the excess carrier lifetime. In contrast, for the CIGS solar cells investigated here, the relaxation time is dominated by trapping and emission from shallow minority carrier traps.","Wiley","","National Renewable Energy Lab.

The robust growth of the brookite polymorph of TiO<sub>2</sub>, a promising photocatalyst, has been difficult in both powder and thin-film forms due to the disparity of reported synthesis techniques, their highly specific nature, and lack of mechanistic understanding. In this work, we report the growth of high-fraction (~95%) brookite thin films prepared by annealing amorphous titania precursor films deposited by pulsed laser deposition. We characterize the crystallization process, eliminating the previously suggested roles of substrate templating and Na helper ions in driving brookite formation. Instead, we link phase selection directly to film thickness, offering a novel, generalizable route to brookite growth that does not rely on the presence of extraneous elements or particular lattice-matched substrates. In addition to providing a new synthesis route to brookite thin films, our results take a step towards resolving the problem of phase selection in TiO<sub>2</sub> growth, contributing to the further development of this promising functional material.","Nature Publishing Group","","National Renewable Energy Lab.

In this paper, the industry-provided full-detail interconnection models were further validated by synchrophasor frequency measurements and realistically-projected PV geographic distribution information were used to develop extra-high PV penetration scenarios and dynamic models for the three main U.S. interconnections, including Eastern Interconnection (EI), Western Electricity Coordinating Council (WECC), and Electric Reliability Council of Texas (ERCOT). Up to 65% instantaneous PV and 15% wind penetration were simulated and the frequency response change trend of each U.S. interconnection due to the increasing PV penetration level were examined. Most importantly, the practical solutions to address the declining frequency response were discussed. This paper will provide valuable guidance for policy makers, utility operators and academic researchers not only in the U.S. but also other countries in the world.","IEEE","","National Renewable Energy Lab.

We examine how initial deposition temperatures and morphology influence grain size and lifetime after CdCl<sub>2</sub> recrystallization. Techniques are developed to estimate grain distribution quickly with low-cost optical microscopy, which compares well with electron backscatter diffraction data providing corroborative assessments of exposed CdTe grain structures. Average grain size increases as a function of CdCl<sub>2</sub> temperature. For lower temperature close-spaced sublimation CdTe depositions, there can be more stress and grain segregation during recrystallization. However, the resulting lifetimes and grain sizes are similar to high-temperature CdTe depositions.

The record efficiency reported for perovskite solar cells has risen rapidly, and is now more than 22%. However, due to their complex dynamic behaviour, the process of measuring the efficiency of perovskite solar cells appears to be much more complicated than for other technologies. It has long been acknowledged that this is likely to greatly reduce the reliability of reported efficiency measurements, but the quantitative extent to which this occurs has not been determined. To investigate this, we conduct the first major inter-comparison of this PV technology. The participants included two labs accredited for PV performance measurement (CSIRO and NREL) and eight PV research laboratories. We find that the inter-laboratory measurement variability can be almost ten times larger for a slowly responding perovskite cell than for a control silicon cell. We show that for such a cell, the choice of measurement method, far more so than measurement hardware, is the single-greatest cause for this undesirably large variability. We provide recommendations for identifying the most appropriate method for a given cell, depending on its stabilization and degradation behaviour. Moreover, the results of this study suggest that identifying a consensus technique for accurate and meaningful efficiency measurements of perovskite solar cells will lead to an immediate improvement in reliability. This, in turn, should assist device researchers to correctly evaluate promising new materials and fabrication methods, and further boost the development of this technology.","Royal Society of Chemistry","","National Renewable Energy Lab.

Knowledge of their optical and electronic properties is important in designing and fabricating efficient solar cells, especially as the device complexity increases and includes micron-scale features. Here, a camera-based photoluminescence (PL) technique is developed to image the thickness of specific passivating films on silicon wafers. The technique is entirely contactless and nondestructive, requires minimal sample preparation, and provides a large dynamic range in terms of field of view, with micron-scale spatial resolution possible. It retains the advantages of PL imaging, a mainstream technique for photovoltaic material and device characterization, and it has some extra capabilities similar to those of ellipsometry. This newly developed technique is demonstrated on hydrogenated amorphous silicon and silicon nitride films, two important passivation technologies for high-efficiency silicon solar cells.","","","National Renewable Energy Lab.

This is most often the case with thin film technologies, including perovskite cells, where the active layers are a few microns thick and can be sensitive to moisture, liquid water or both. When moisture or liquid water can ingress, a small amount of water can lead to corrosion and depending on the resulting reactions, a larger local detrimental effect is possible. To prevent moisture from contacting photovoltaic components, impermeable frontsheets and backsheets are used with a polyisobutylene (PIB)-based edge seal material around the perimeter. Here, we evaluate the ability of a PIB-based edge seal using a molecular sieve desiccant to keep moisture out for the expected module lifetime. Moisture ingress is evaluated using test coupons where the edge seal is placed between 2 pieces of glass, one of which has a metallic calcium film on it, and monitoring the moisture ingress distance as a function of time. We expose samples to different temperature and humidity conditions to create permeation models useful for extrapolation to field use. This extrapolation indicates that this PIB material is capable of keeping moisture out of a module for the desired lifetime.","Wiley","","National Renewable Energy Lab.

We present experimental evidence for the optically induced metastability transition and expand the divacancy model with first-principles calculations. Using photoluminescence excitation spectroscopy, we identify a sub-bandgap optical transition that severely deteriorates the carrier lifetime. This is in accordance with the expanded divacancy model, which predicts that states below the conduction band are responsible for the metastability change. We determine the density–capture cross-section product of the induced lifetime-limiting states and evaluate their impact on device performance. The experimental and theoretical findings presented can allow assessment of metastability characteristics of leading thin-film photovoltaic technologies.","Nature Publishing Group","","National Renewable Energy Lab.

However, the substantial challenge in optimizing carrier concentration without disrupting the superlattice structure prevents further improvement of the thermoelectric performance. Here we demonstrate a strategy for carrier optimization in a hybrid inorganic–organic superlattice of TiS<sub>2</sub>[tetrabutylammonium] x [hexylammonium] y, where the organic layers are composed of a random mixture of tetrabutylammonium and hexylammonium molecules. By vacuum heating the hybrid materials at an intermediate temperature, the hexylammonium molecules with a lower boiling point are selectively de-intercalated, which reduces the electron density due to the requirement of electroneutrality. The tetrabutylammonium molecules with a higher boiling point remain to support and stabilize the superlattice structure. Furthermore, the carrier concentration can thus be effectively reduced, resulting in a remarkably high power factor of 904 µW m<sup>–1</sup> K<sup>–2</sup> at 300 K for flexible thermoelectrics, approaching the values achieved in conventional inorganic semiconductors.","Nature Publishing Group","","National Renewable Energy Lab.

We compare stresses and levels for accelerated testing of inverters proposed in the standard drafts, and those proposed by manufacturers and purchasers of inverters. We also review bases for the methods, stress types, and stress levels for durability testing of key inverter components. Many of the test protocols appear to need more comprehensive inclusion of stress factors existing in the natural environment such as wind driven rain, dust, and grid disturbances. Further understanding of how temperature, humidity ingress, and voltage bias affect the inverters and their components is also required. We provide data indicating inconsistent quality of the inverters and the durability of components leading to greater cost for the photovoltaic plant operator. Accordingly, the recommendation for data collection within quality standards for obtaining cost of ownership metrics is made.

Using a heliostat field and power block three orders of magnitude smaller than conventional solar power towers, our unique configuration locates thermal storage and a power block directly on a tower receiver. To make the system dispatchable, a valved thermosyphon controls heat flow from a latent heat thermal storage tank to a Stirling engine. The modular design results in minimal balance of system costs and enables high deployment rates with a rapid realization of economies of scale.

Here, we observe sharp emission peaks from individual defect sites that are spread over an extremely broad, 1000-1350 nm, spectral range. Our simulations allow us to attribute this spectral diversity to the occurrence of six chemically and energetically distinct defect states resulting from topological variation in the chemical binding configuration of the monovalent aryl groups. Both PL emission efficiency and spectral line width of the defect states are strongly influenced by the local dielectric environment. Wrapping the SWCNT with a polyfluorene polymer provides the best isolation from the environment and yields the brightest emission with near-resolution limited spectral line width of 270 ueV, as well as spectrally resolved emission wings associated with localized acoustic phonons. Pump-dependent studies further revealed that the defect states are capable of emitting single, sharp, isolated PL peaks over 3 orders of magnitude increase in pump power, a key characteristic of two-level systems and an important prerequisite for single-photon emission with high purity. Our findings point to the tremendous potential of sp3 defects in development of room temperature quantum light sources capable of operating at telecommunication wavelengths as the emission of the defect states can readily be extended to this range via use of larger diameter SWCNTs.","American Chemical Society (ACS)","","Los Alamos National Lab.

In order to mitigate these defects, a high-temperature homogenization anneal called <em>tabula rasa</em> (TR) that has been used in the electronics industry is now proposed for use in solar-grade wafers. This work addresses the kinetics of <em>tabula rasa</em> by elucidating the activation energy governing oxide precipitate dissolution, which is found to be 2.6 ± 0.5 eV. This value is consistent within uncertainty to the migration enthalpy of oxygen interstitials in silicon, implying TR to be kinetically limited by oxygen point-defect diffusion. Furthermore, this large activation energy is observed to limit oxygen precipitate dissolution during standard TR conditions, suggesting that more aggressive annealing conditions than conventionally used are required for complete bulk microdefect mitigation.","American Institute of Physics (AIP)","","National Renewable Energy Lab.

"Optoelectronic Properties of Strontium and Barium Copper Sulfides Prepared by Combinatorial Sputtering","Han, Yanbing; Siol, Sebastian; Zhang, Qun; Zakutayev, Andriy","14 SOLAR ENERGY; 36 MATERIALS SCIENCE; photovoltaics; transparent electronics; optoelectronic properties","Optically transparent materials with p-type electrical conductivity can facilitate the development of transparent electronics and improve the efficiency of photovoltaic solar cells. Sulfide materials represent an interesting alternative to oxides for these applications due to better hole transport properties. We prepare transparent and conductive Ba-Cu-S thin films by combinatorial cosputtering and characterized for their composition, structure, and optoelectronic properties. The conductivity and transparency of these films are found to be strongly dependent on their chemical composition and the substrate temperature during growth. The conductivity of BaCu<sub>2</sub>S<sub>2</sub> and BaCu<sub>4</sub>S<sub>3</sub> can reach 53 S/cm (at 250 °C) and 74 S/cm (at 200 degrees C), respectively, which is higher than their solution processed/bulk counterparts. The 90% reflectance corrected transmittance is achieved in the wavelength range 600-1000 nm for BaCu<sub>2</sub>S<sub>2</sub> and 650-1000 nm for BaCu<sub>4</sub>S<sub>3</sub> (at 250 °C). These electrical and optical properties are comparable with other recently presented transparent p-type conductors, while the 200-350 degrees C processing temperature is low enough to be used in semiconductor devices with limited thermal budgets. Some attempts have been made to synthesize the related Sr-Cu-S materials, following the theoretical suggestion of their potential as transparent p-type conductors, but these attempts resulted only in phase-separated SrS and CuxS phases. Alloying BaCu<sub>2</sub>S<sub>2</sub> with Sr on the Ba site on the other hand increases the conductivity to >100 S/cm while only slightly compromising the transparency of the material. To explain the difference between the Ba and the Sr containing copper sulfides, the lower bounds on the SrCu<sub>2</sub>S<sub>2</sub> and SrCu<sub>4</sub>S<sub>3</sub> formation enthalpies are estimated. While the doping of the Ba-Cu-S materials presented here is too large for application in transparent electronics, it is promising for potential use as p-type contact layers in thin film solar cells.","American Chemical Society (ACS)","","National Renewable Energy Lab.

"Economic Justification of Concentrating Solar Power in High Renewable Energy Penetrated Power Systems","Hodge, Brian S; Kroposki, Benjamin D; Du, Ershun; Zhang, Ning; Kang, Chongqing; Xia, Qing","14 SOLAR ENERGY; 29 ENERGY PLANNING, POLICY, AND ECONOMY; concentrating solar power; variable renewable energy; operational flexibility; break-even cost; economic justification","Concentrating solar power (CSP) plants are able to provide both renewable energy and operational flexibility at the same time due to its thermal energy storage (TES). It is ideal generation to power systems lacking in flexibility to accommodate variable renewable energy (VRE) generation such as wind power and photovoltaics. However, its investment cost currently is too high to justify its benefit in terms of providing renewable energy only. In this paper we evaluate the economic benefit of CSP in high renewable energy penetrated power systems from two aspects: generating renewable energy and providing operational flexibility to help accommodating VRE. In order to keep the same renewable energy penetration level during evaluation, we compare the economic costs between the system with a high share of VRE and another in which some part of the VRE generation is replaced by CSP generation. The generation cost of a power system is analyzed through chronological operation simulation over a whole year. The benefit of CSP is quantified into two parts: (1) energy benefit - the saving investment of substituted VRE generation and (2) flexibility benefit - the reduction in operating cost due to substituting VRE with CSP. The break-even investment cost of CSP is further discussed. The methodology is tested on a modified IEEE RTS-79 system. The economic justifications of CSP are demonstrated in two practical provincial power systems with high penetration of renewable energy in northwestern China, Qinghai and Gansu, where the former province has massive inflexible thermal power plants but later one has high share of flexible hydro power. The results suggest that the CSP is more beneficial in Gansu system than in Qinghai. The levelized benefit of CSP, including both energy benefit and flexibility benefit, is about 0.177-0.191 $/kWh in Qinghai and about 0.238-0.300 $/kWh in Gansu, when replacing 5-20% VRE generation with CSP generation.","Elsevier","","National Renewable Energy Lab.

A characterization approach based on analyzing the band bending induced in the c-Si absorber and the external and implied open-circuit voltage of test structures was used. It is shown that the oxygen partial pressure allows to tailor the selectivity to some extent and that a direct correlation between induced band bending and hole selectivity exists.

While relatively good electron selectivity was presented recently by other groups, we show that carrier selectivity can be engineered from electron to hole selective depending on the deposition conditions, post deposition annealing and the contact material covering the TiOx layer. For both the electron and hole contacts, an open-circuit voltage (Voc) of ~ >650 mV is obtained. The fact that the Voc is correlated with the (asymmetric) induced c-Si band bending suggests that carrier selectivity is mainly governed by the effective work function and/or the fixed charge rather than by the asymmetric band offsets at the Si/TiOx interface, which provides important insight into the basic function of metal-oxide-based contact systems.","Elsevier","","National Renewable Energy Lab.

Perovskite solar cells are particularly promising as a top cell in monolithic tandem devices due to their rapid development towards high efficiencies, a tunable band gap with a sharp optical absorption edge and a simple production process. In monolithic tandem devices, the perovskite solar cell is deposited directly on the silicon cell, requiring low-temperature processes (< 200 °C) to maintain functionality of under-lying layers of the silicon cell in case of highly efficient silicon hetero-junction (SHJ) bottom solar cell. In this work, we present a complete low-temperature process for perovskite solar cells including a mesoporous titanium oxide (TiO<sub>2</sub>) scaffold - a structure yielding the highest efficiencies for single-junction perovskite solar cells. We show that evaporation of the compact TiO<sub>2</sub> hole blocking layer and ultra-violet (UV) curing for the mesoporous TiO<sub>2</sub> layer allows for good performance, comparable to high-temperature (> 500 °C) processes. With both manufacturing routes, we obtain short-circuit current densities (J<sub>SC</sub>) of about 20 mA/cm<sup>2</sup>, open-circuit voltages (V<sub>OC</sub>) over 1 V, fill factors (FF) between 0.7 and 0.8 and efficiencies (n) of more than 15%. We further show that the evaporated TiO<sub>2</sub> layer is suitable for the application in tandem devices. The series resistance of the layer itself and the contact resistance to an indium doped tin oxide (ITO) interconnection layer between the two sub-cells are low. Additionally, the low parasitic absorption for wavelengths above the perovskite band gap allow a higher absorption in the silicon bottom solar cell, which is essential to achieve high tandem efficiencies.","Elsevier","","National Renewable Energy Lab.

This NaCl–KCl composition has a melting point of 657 °C, which makes it suitable for latent-heat thermal energy storage in concentrating solar power applications. Several nickel-based MCrAlX coatings were tested, where M = Ni and/or Co and X = Y, Ta, Hf, and/or Si. Electrochemical testing was carried out to determine corrosion rates. The bare In800H and 310SS alloys corroded rapidly (~2500 and 4500 µm/yr, respectively, assuming uniform corrosion). Concentrating solar power plants need containment materials with a lifetime of at least 30 years; thus, these corrosion rates are excessive. Corrosion mitigation approaches are being investigated to obtain degradation on the order of 20 µm/yr or lower. The lowest corrosion rate of 190 µm/yr was obtained for atmospheric plasma spray NiCoCrAlY coatings pre-oxidized in air at 900 °C for 24 h with a heating/cooling rate of 0.5 °C/min. Metallographic characterization of the corroded surfaces showed that the formation of a uniform thin alumina scale before exposure to the molten chloride system considerably reduced the corrosion of the alloy. However, the rates of corrosion determined herein are considerable, highlighting the relevance of testing materials durability in solar power applications.","Springer","","National Renewable Energy Lab.

And from the PFM, the piezoelectric response of the films was strongly correlated with low-index planes of the crystal structure and ferroelastic domains in macroscale solution-grown MAPbI<sub>3</sub> crystals, which implied long-range order near the top surface. From the NI, it was found that the induced cracks were straight and extended across the full width of the apparent grains, which indicated that the long-range order was not limited to the near-surface region, but extended through the film thickness. Interestingly, the two MAPbI<sub>3</sub> processes examined resulted in subtle differences in the extracted electro-mechanical and fracture properties, but exhibited similar power conversion efficiencies of >17% in completed devices.","American Chemical Society (ACS)","","National Renewable Energy Lab.

A discussion of singlet fission in thin polycrystalline layers of these materials follows. The highest quantum yield of triplet formation by singlet fission, 200% at 80 K, is found in one of the two known crystal modification of the parent. In the other modification and in many derivatives, excimer formation competes successfully and triplet yields are low. A description of solution photophysics of covalent dimers is described in the next section. Triplet yields are very low, but interesting phenomena are uncovered. One is an observation of a separated-charges (charge-transfer) intermediate in highly polar solvents. The other is an observation of excitation isomerism in both singlet and triplet states, where in one isomer the excitation is delocalized over both halves of the covalent dimer, whereas in the other it is localized on one of the halves. Finally, in the last section we present the operation of a simple device illustrating the use of triplets generated by singlet fission for charge separation.","Springer","","National Renewable Energy Lab.

"Evaluation and comparison of an adaptive method technique for improved performance of linear Fresnel secondary designs","Hack, Madeline; Zhu, Guangdong; Wendelin, Timothy J.","14 SOLAR ENERGY; 47 OTHER INSTRUMENTATION; concentrating solar power; linear fresnel collector; secondary reflector; solar optics","As a line-focus concentrating solar power (CSP) technology, linear Fresnel collectors have the potential to become a low-cost solution for electricity production and a variety of thermal energy applications. However, this technology often suffers from relatively low performance. A secondary reflector is a key component used to improve optical performance of a linear Fresnel collector. The shape of a secondary reflector is particularly critical in determining solar power captured by the absorber tube(s), and thus, the collector's optical performance. However, to the authors' knowledge, no well-established process existed to derive the optimal secondary shape prior to the development of a new adaptive method to optimize the secondary reflector shape. The new adaptive method does not assume any pre-defined analytical form; rather, it constitutes an optimum shape through an adaptive process by maximizing the energy collection onto the absorber tube. In this paper, the adaptive method is compared with popular secondary-reflector designs with respect to a collector's optical performance under various scenarios. For the first time, a comprehensive, in-depth comparison was conducted on all popular secondary designs for CSP applications. In conclusion, it is shown that the adaptive design exhibits the best optical performance.","Elsevier","","National Renewable Energy Lab.

"Cathodoluminescence for the 21st century: Learning more from light","Coenen, T.; Haegel, N. M.","14 SOLAR ENERGY; cathodoluminescence; nanophotonics; transport","Cathodoluminescence (CL) is the emission of light from a material in response to excitation by incident electrons. The technique has had significant impact in the characterization of semiconductors, minerals, ceramics, and many nanostructured materials. Since 2010, there have been a number of innovative developments that have revolutionized and expanded the information that can be gained from CL and broadened the areas of application. While the primary historical application of CL was for spatial mapping of luminescence variations (e.g., imaging dark line defects in semiconductor lasers or providing high resolution imaging of compositional variations in geological materials), new ways to collect and analyze the emitted light have expanded the science impact of CL, particularly at the intersection of materials science and nanotechnology. Current developments include (1) angular and polarized CL, (2) advances in time resolved CL, (3) far-field and near-field transport imaging that enable drift and diffusion information to be obtained through real space imaging, (4) increasing use of statistical analyses for the study of grain boundaries and interfaces, (5) 3D CL including tomography and combined work utilizing dual beam systems with CL, and (6) combined STEM/CL measurements that are reaching new levels of resolution and advancing single photon spectroscopy. This focused review will first summarize the fundamentals and then briefly describe the state-of-the-art in conventional CL imaging and spectroscopy. We also review these recent novel experimental approaches that enable added insight and information, providing a range of examples from nanophotonics, photovoltaics, plasmonics, and studies of individual defects and grain boundaries.","American Institute of Physics (AIP)","","National Renewable Energy Lab.

In contrast to many semiconducting polymers, semiconducting SWCNTs (s-SWCNTs) represent unique one-dimensional organic semiconductors with chemical and physical properties that facilitate equivalent transport of electrons and holes. These factors have driven increasing attention to employing s-SWCNTs for electronic and energy harvesting applications, including thermoelectric (TE) generators. Here we demonstrate a combination of ink chemistry, solid-state polymer removal, and charge-transfer doping strategies that enable unprecedented n-type and p-type TE power factors, in the range of 700 μW m<sup>–1</sup> K<sup>–2</sup> at 298 K for the same solution-processed highly enriched thin films containing 100% s-SWCNTs. We also demonstrate that the thermal conductivity appears to decrease with decreasing s-SWCNT diameter, leading to a peak material zT ≈ 0.12 for s-SWCNTs with diameters in the range of 1.0 nm. Here, our results indicate that the TE performance of s-SWCNT-only material systems is approaching that of traditional inorganic semiconductors, paving the way for these materials to be used as the primary components for efficient, all-organic TE generators.","Royal Society of Chemistry","","National Renewable Energy Lab.

While encouraging performance has been demonstrated, the stability issue of the red-emitting CsPbI3 is still a major concern due to its small tolerance factor. Here we report a highly stable CsPbI3 quantum dot LED with red emission fabricated using an improved purification approach. The device achieved decent external quantum efficiency (EQE) of 0.21 % at a bias of 6 V and outstanding operational stability, with a L70 lifetime (EL intensity decreases to 70% of starting value) of 16 h and 1.5 h under a constant driving voltage of 5 V and 6 V (maximum EQE operation) respectively. Furthermore, the device can work under a higher voltage of 7 V (maximum luminance operation) and retain 50% of its initial EL intensity after 500 s. These findings demonstrate the promise of CsPbI3 quantum dots for stable red LEDs, and suggest the feasibility for electrically pumped perovskite lasers with further device optimizations.","IOP Publishing","","National Renewable Energy Lab.

"Spectral binning for energy production calculations and multijunction solar cell design","Garcia, Iván; McMahon, William E.; Habte, Aron; Geisz, John F.; Steiner, Myles A.; Sengupta, Manajit; Friedman, Daniel J.","14 SOLAR ENERGY; energy harvesting efficiency; multijunction solar cells; spectral binning","Currently, most solar cells are designed for and evaluated under standard spectra intended to represent typical spectral conditions. However, no single spectrum can capture the spectral variability needed for annual energy production (AEP) calculations, and this shortcoming becomes more significant for series-connected multijunction cells as the number of junctions increases. For this reason, AEP calculations are often performed on very detailed yearlong sets of data, but these pose 2 inherent challenges: (1) These data sets comprise thousands of data points, which appear as a scattered cloud of data when plotted against typical parameters and are hence cumbersome to classify and compare, and (2) large sets of spectra bring with them a corresponding increase in computation or measurement time. Here, we show how a large spectral set can be reduced to just a few 'proxy' spectra, which still retain the spectral variability information needed for AEP design and evaluation. The basic 'spectral binning' methods should be extensible to a variety of multijunction device architectures. In this study, as a demonstration, the AEP of a 4-junction device is computed for both a full set of spectra and a reduced proxy set, and the results show excellent agreement for as few as 3 proxy spectra. This enables much faster (and thereby more detailed) calculations and indoor measurements and provides a manageable way to parameterize a spectral set, essentially creating a 'spectral fingerprint,' which should facilitate the understanding and comparison of different sites.","Wiley","","National Renewable Energy Lab.

The devices included two samples in standard and two in high-efficiency crystalline silicon technology, two CI(G)S and one CdTe module. The reference value for each PV module parameter was calculated from the average of the results of all four laboratories, weighted by the respective measurement uncertainties. All single results were then analysed with respect to this reference value using the E<sub>n</sub> number approach. For the four modules in crystalline silicon technology, the results agreed in general within +/-0.5%, with all values within +/-1% and all E<sub>n</sub> numbers well within [-1, 1], indicating further scope for reducing quoted measurement uncertainty. Regarding the three thin-film modules, deviations were on average roughly twice as large, i.e. in general from +/-1% to +/-2%. A number of inconsistent results were observable, although within the 5% that can be statistically expected on the basis of the E<sub>n</sub> number approach. Most inconsistencies can be traced to the preconditioning procedure of one participant, although contribution of other factors cannot be ruled out. After removing these obvious inconsistent results, only two real outliers remained, representing less than 2% of the total number of measurands. The results presented show improved agreement for the calibration of PV modules with respect to previous international exercises. For thin-film PV modules, the preconditioning of the devices prior to calibration measurements is the most critical factor for obtaining consistent results, while the measurement processes seem consistent and repeatable.","Elsevier","","National Renewable Energy Lab.

"Proposal and evaluation of subordinate standard solar irradiance spectra for applications in solar energy systems","Jessen, Wilko; Wilbert, Stefan; Gueymard, Christian A.; Polo, Jesus; Bian, Zeqiang; Driesse, Anton; Habte, Aron; Marzo, Aitor; Armstrong, Peter R.; Vignola, Frank; Ramirez, Lourdes","14 SOLAR ENERGY; 24 POWER TRANSMISSION AND DISTRIBUTION; solar spectra; efficiency rating; spectral response; standardization","Reference solar irradiance spectra are needed to specify key parameters of solar technologies such as photovoltaic cell efficiency, in a comparable way. The IEC 60904-3 and ASTM G173 standards present such spectra for Direct Normal Irradiance (DNI) and Global Tilted Irradiance (GTI) on a 37 degrees tilted sun-facing surface for one set of clear-sky conditions with an air mass of 1.5 and low aerosol content. The IEC/G173 standard spectra are the widely accepted references for these purposes. Hence, the authors support the future replacement of the outdated ISO 9845 spectra with the IEC spectra within the ongoing update of this ISO standard. The use of a single reference spectrum per component of irradiance is important for clarity when comparing and rating solar devices such as PV cells. However, at some locations the average spectra can differ strongly from those defined in the IEC/G173 standards due to widely different atmospheric conditions and collector tilt angles. Therefore, additional subordinate standard spectra for other atmospheric conditions and tilt angles are of interest for a rough comparison of product performance under representative field conditions, in addition to using the main standard spectrum for product certification under standard test conditions. This simplifies the product selection for solar power systems when a fully-detailed performance analysis is not feasible (e.g. small installations). Also, the effort for a detailed yield analyses can be reduced by decreasing the number of initial product options. After appropriate testing, this contribution suggests a number of additional spectra related to eight sets of atmospheric conditions and tilt angles that are currently considered within ASTM and ISO working groups. The additional spectra, called subordinate standard spectra, are motivated by significant spectral mismatches compared to the IEC/G173 spectra (up to 6.5%, for PV at 37 degrees tilt and 10-15% for CPV). These mismatches correspond to potential accuracy improvements for a quick estimation of the average efficiency by applying the appropriate subordinate standard spectrum instead of the IEC/G173 spectra. The applicability of these spectra for PV performance analyses is confirmed at five test sites, for which subordinate spectra could be intuitively selected based on the average atmospheric aerosol optical depth (AOD) and precipitable water vapor at those locations. The development of subordinate standard spectra for DNI and concentrating solar power (CSP) and concentrating PV (CPV) is also considered. However, it is found that many more sets of atmospheric conditions would be required to allow the intuitive selection of DNI spectra for the five test sites, due in particular to the stronger effect of AOD on DNI compared to GTI. In conclusion, the matrix of subordinate GTI spectra described in this paper are recommended to appear as an option in the annex of future standards, in addition to the obligatory use of the main spectrum from the ASTM G173 and IEC 60904 standards.","Elsevier","","National Renewable Energy Lab.

"Predictive performance modeling framework for a novel enclosed particle receiver configuration and application for thermochemical energy storage","Martinek, Janna; Wendelin, Timothy; Ma, Zhiwen","14 SOLAR ENERGY; 47 OTHER INSTRUMENTATION; concentrating solar power; heat transfer; modeling; particle; thermochemical energy storage","Concentrating solar power (CSP) plants can provide dispatchable power with a thermal energy storage capability for increased renewable-energy grid penetration. Particle-based CSP systems permit higher temperatures, and thus, potentially higher solar-to-electric efficiency than state-of-the-art molten-salt heat-transfer systems. This paper describes a detailed numerical analysis framework for estimating the performance of a novel, geometrically complex, enclosed particle receiver design. The receiver configuration uses arrays of small tubular absorbers to collect and subsequently transfer solar energy to a flowing particulate medium. The enclosed nature of the receiver design renders it amenable to either an inert heat-transfer medium, or a reactive heat-transfer medium that requires a controllable ambient environment. The numerical analysis framework described in this study is demonstrated for the case of thermal reduction of CaCr<sub>0.1</sub>Mn<sub>0.9</sub>O<sub>3-$\delta$</sub> for thermochemical energy storage. The modeling strategy consists of Monte Carlo ray tracing for absorbed solar-energy distributions from a surround heliostat field, computational fluid dynamics modeling of small-scale local tubular arrays, surrogate response surfaces that approximately capture simulated tubular array performance, a quasi-two-dimensional reduced-order description of counter-flow reactive solids and purge gas, and a radiative exchange model applied to embedded-cavity structures at the size scale of the full receiver. In this work we apply the numerical analysis strategy to a single receiver configuration, but the framework can be generically applicable to alternative enclosed designs. In conclusion, we assess sensitivity of receiver performance to surface optical properties, heat-transfer coefficients, solids outlet temperature, and purge-gas feed rates, and discuss the significance of model assumptions and results for future receiver development.","Elsevier","","National Renewable Energy Lab.

However, the key for a successful materials screening is a suitable selection metric that goes beyond the Shockley-Queisser theory that determines the thermodynamic efficiency limit of an absorber material solely by its band-gap energy. Here, we develop a selection metric to quantify the potential photovoltaic efficiency of a material. Our approach is compatible with detailed balance and applicable in computational and experimental materials screening. We use the complex refractive index to calculate radiative and nonradiative efficiency limits and the respective optimal thickness in the high mobility limit. We also compare our model to the widely applied selection metric by Yu and Zunger [Phys. Rev. Lett. 108, 068701 (2012)] with respect to their dependence on thickness, internal luminescence quantum efficiency, and refractive index.

"Quantification of Sheet Resistance in Boron-Diffused Silicon Using Micro-Photoluminescence Spectroscopy at Room Temperature","Nguyen, Hieu T.; Johnston, Steve; Paduthol, Appu; Harvey, Steven P.; Phang, Sieu Pheng; Samundsett, Christian; Sun, Chang; Yan, Di; Trupke, Thorsten; Al-Jassim, Mowafak M.; Macdonald, Daniel","14 SOLAR ENERGY; 36 MATERIALS SCIENCE; diffusion; heavily doped silicon; photoluminescence; solar cells; spectroscopy","A micro-photoluminescence-based technique is presented, to quantify and map sheet resistances of boron-diffused layers in silicon solar cell precursors with micron-scale spatial resolution at room temperature. The technique utilizes bandgap narrowing effects in the heavily-doped layers, yielding a broader photoluminescence spectrum at the long-wavelength side compared to the spectrum emitted from lightly doped silicon. By choosing an appropriate spectral range as a metric to assess the doping density, the impacts of photon reabsorption on the analysis can be avoided; thus, an accurate characterization of the sheet resistance can be made. This metric is demonstrated to be better representative of the sheet resistance than the surface doping density or the total dopant concentration of the diffused layer. The technique is applied to quantify sheet resistances of 12-um-wide diffused fingers in interdigitated back-contact solar cell precursors and large diffused areas. The results are confirmed by both 4-point probe and time-of-flight secondary-ion mass spectrometry measurements. Lastly, the practical limitations associated with extending the proposed technique into an imaging mode are presented and explained.","Wiley","","National Renewable Energy Lab.

"Robust Processing of Small-Molecule:Fullerene Organic Solar Cells via Use of Nucleating Agents","Treat, Neil D.; Reid, Obadiah G.; Fearn, Sarah; Rumbles, Garry; Hawker, Craig J.; Chabinyc, Michael L.; Stingelin, Natalie","14 SOLAR ENERGY; 71 CLASSICAL AND QUANTUM MECHANICS, GENERAL PHYSICS; device yield; nucleating agents; organic solar cells; processing aids; processing reproducibility; small-molecule:fullerene blends","The power conversion efficiency (PCE) of small-molecule bulk heterojunction solar cells is highly sensitive to the 'ink' formulation used to produce the photoactive layer. Here we demonstrate that the addition of nucleating agents renders device fabrication notably less susceptible to the ink composition, promising a route toward more robust processing of efficient devices over large areas and enabling more facile materials screening. We selected as a model system blends of 7,7-[4,4-bis(2-ethylhexyl)-4H-silolo[3,2-b:4,5-b]dithiophene-2,6-diyl]bis[6-fluoro-4-(5-hexyl-[2,2-bithiophen]-5-yl)benzo[c][1,2,5]thiadiazole](p-DTS(FBTTh2)2) as the donor and [6,6]-phenyl C71-butyric acid methyl ester (PC71BM) as the acceptor because this is one of the small-molecule OPV blends with a device performance that is most sensitive to ink formulation, especially when used with the processing aid diiodooctane (DIO). Addition of DIO is essential to obtain high device performances; however, a notable increase in device performance is only achieved over a very narrow DIO content regime. Use of nucleating agents drastically changes this situation and leads to well-performing devices even at extreme levels of DIO. We thus start to address here one of the great challenges in organic solar cell research: the fact that, too often, only a very limited composition range leads to high efficiency devices. This means that for every new donor or acceptor a multitude of formulations have to be tested, including in combination with processing aids, to ensure that promising materials are not overlooked. The use of nucleating agents, thus, promises to render materials discovery more straightforward as this dependency of device performance with composition can be reduced.","American Chemical Society (ACS)","","National Renewable Energy Lab.

"Defining Threshold Values of Encapsulant and Backsheet Adhesion for PV Module Reliability","Bosco, Nick; Eafanti, Joshua; Kurtz, Sarah; Tracy, Jared; Dauskardt, Reinhold","14 SOLAR ENERGY; 42 ENGINEERING; adhesive strength; reliability; photovoltaic cells","The width-tapered cantilever beam method is used to quantify the debond energy (adhesion) of encapsulant and backsheet structures of 32 modules collected from the field. The collected population of modules contains both those that have remained intact and those with instances of either or both encapsulant and backsheet delamination. From this survey, initial threshold values (an adhesion value above which a module should remain intact throughout its lifetime) for encapsulant and backsheet interfaces are proposed. For encapsulants this value is ~ 160J/m<sup>2</sup> and for backsheets ~ 10J/m<sup>2</sup>. Here, it is expected that these values will continue to be refined and evolve as the width-tapered cantilever beam method gets adopted by the PV industry, and that they may aid in the future improvement of accelerated lifetime tests and the development of new, low-cost materials.","IEEE","","National Renewable Energy Lab.

"Low irradiance losses of photovoltaic modules","Mavromatakis, F.; Vignola, F.; Marion, Bill","14 SOLAR ENERGY; photovoltaic modules; efficiency; fill factor; series resistance; shunt resistance; low irradiance losses","Here, the efficiency of a photovoltaic cell/module changes, as the intensity of incident irradiance decreases, in a non linear way and these changes are referred to as low irradiance losses. In this study data from field experiments, developed and organized by the National Renewable Energy Laboratory, are used to evaluate the low irradiance losses for a variety of module technologies. The results demonstrate that the ratio of the normalized power divided by the normalized short circuit current provide a good measure of the module's low light efficiency losses after both the maximum power and the short circuit current are adjusted for temperature effects. The normalized efficiencies determined through the field data, spanning for several months, are in good agreement with those determined under controlled conditions in a solar simulator. An analytical relation for the normalized efficiency is proposed based on existing formulation for the fill factor. Despite the approximate nature of the fill factor relation, this approach produces reliable results. It will be shown that a normalized efficiency curve can be used to extract information on the series and shunt resistances of the PV module and that the shunt resistance as a function of solar irradiance can be studied. Alternately, this formulation can be used to study the low irradiance losses of a module when the internal resistances are known.","Elsevier","","National Renewable Energy Lab.

ZnSnN<sub>2</sub> is a ternary nitride of interest for photovoltaics, which forms in a wurtzite-derived crystal structure. In the ground state, every N anion is coordinated by two Zn and two Sn cations, thereby observing the octet rule locally. Using a motif-based model Hamiltonian, we performed Monte Carlo simulations that provide atomistic representations of ZnSnN<sub>2</sub> with varying degrees of cation disorder. Subsequent electronic structure calculations describe the evolution of band gaps, optical properties, and carrier localization effects as a function of the disorder. We find that octet-rule conserving disorder is practically impossible to avoid but perfectly benign, with hardly any effects on the electronic structure. In contrast, a fully random cation distribution would be very detrimental, but fortunately it is energetically highly unfavorable. A degree of disorder that can realistically be expected for nonequilibrium thin-film deposition leads to a moderate band-gap reduction and to moderate carrier localization effects. Comparing the simulated structures with experimental samples grown by sputtering, we find evidence that these samples indeed incorporate a certain degree of octet-rule violating disorder, which is reflected in the x-ray diffraction and in the optical absorption spectra. This study demonstrates that the electronic properties of ZnSnN<sub>2</sub> are dominated by changes of the local coordination environments rather than long-range ordering effects.","American Physical Society (APS)","","National Renewable Energy Lab.

This work lays a foundation for identifying and controlling these phase impurities. Films of Cu-K-In-Se were co-evaporated at varied K/(K + Cu) compositions and substrate temperatures (with constant (K + Cu)/In ~ 0.85). Increased Na composition on the substrate's surface and decreased growth temperature were both found to favor Cu<sub>1-x</sub>K<sub>x</sub>InSe<sub>2</sub> alloy formation, relative to two-phase CuInSe<sub>2</sub>+KInSe<sub>2</sub> formation. Structures from X-ray diffraction (XRD), band gaps, resistivities, minority carrier lifetimes and carrier concentrations from time-resolved photoluminescence were in agreement with previous reports, where low K/(K + Cu) composition films exhibited properties promising for photovoltaic absorbers. Films grown at 400-500 °C were then annealed to 600 degrees C in a controlled Se ambient, which caused K loss by evaporation in proportion to the initial K/(K + Cu) composition. Similar to growth temperature, annealing drove Cu<sub>1-x</sub>K<sub>x</sub>InSe<sub>2</sub> alloy consumption and CuInSe<sub>2</sub>+KInSe<sub>2</sub> production, as evidenced by high temperature XRD. Annealing also decomposed KInSe<sub>2</sub> and formed K<sub>2</sub>In<sub>12</sub>Se<sub>19</sub>. At high temperature, the KInSe<sub>2</sub> crystal lattice gradually contracted as temperature and time increased, as well as just time. Evaporative loss of K during annealing could accompany the generation of vacancies on K lattice sites, and may explain the KInSe<sub>2</sub> lattice contraction. As a result, this knowledge of Cu-K-In-Se material chemistry may be used to predict and control minor phase impurities in Cu(In,Ga)(Se,S)<sub>2</sub> photovoltaic absorbers - where impurities below typical detection limits may have played a role in recent world record photovoltaic efficiencies that utilized KF post-deposition treatments.","Elsevier","","National Renewable Energy Lab.

The cost per Watt of the modeled tandems is lower than crystalline silicon, but slightly higher than CdTe alone. But, these higher power modules reduce area-related balance of system costs, providing increased value especially in area-constrained applications.

"An elasto-plastic solution for channel cracking of brittle coating on polymer substrate","Zhang, Chao; Chen, Fangliang; Gray, Matthew H.; Tirawat, Robert; Larsen, Ross E.","14 SOLAR ENERGY; 36 MATERIALS SCIENCE; thin film; channel cracking; elasto-plastic fracture; polymer substrate; fracture toughness","In this study, an elasto-plastic channel-cracking model is presented to study the open-mode fracture of a thin layer brittle coating grown on a polymer substrate. A linear elastic shear interlayer is introduced to describe the stress transfer from the elasto-plastic substrate to the brittle coating, on basis of the shear-lag principle. The channel cracking behavior involves three stages: elastic, elasto-plastic and plastic stages, which are solved in a continuous manner based on the deformation status of the substrate. Explicit solutions are derived for the mutli-stage cracking process. Corresponding experimental tests for a titanium oxide (TiO<sub>2</sub>) coating on a poly (ethylene terephthalate) substrate are conducted. The fracture toughness of the coating layer is estimated based on the crack spacing versus layer thickness relationship at certain strain levels. This method is found to be more reliable than the traditional methods using crack onset strain. Parametric studies of the fracture energy release rate for the coating and interfacial compliance of the thin film system are conducted, through which the effect of plastic deformation on the channel cracking behavior is studied extensively. The results indicate that the tangent modulus of the substrate controls the evolution curvature of crack spacing where a smaller tangent modulus corresponds to a slower saturation of crack spacing. The energy release rate also varies significantly with the properties of the interlayer. The study highlights the necessity of an elasto-plastic model for the thin film systems of brittle coating on a plastic substrate.","Elsevier","","National Renewable Energy Lab.

In addition to thermalization and carrier recombination, one major source of excess heat in modules is the parasitic absorption of light with sub-bandgap energy. Parasitic absorption can be prevented if sub-bandgap radiation is reflected away from the module. We report on the design considerations and projected changes to module energy yield for photonic reflectors capable of reflecting a portion of sub-bandgap radiation while maintaining or improving transmission of light with energy greater than the semiconductor bandgap. Using a previously developed, self-consistent opto-electro-thermal finite-element simulation, we calculate the total additional energy generated by a module, including various photonic reflectors, and decompose these benefits into thermal and optical effects. We show that the greatest total energy yield improvement comes from photonic mirrors designed for the outside of the glass, but that mirrors placed between the glass and the encapsulant can have significant thermal benefit. We then show that optimal photonic mirror design requires consideration of all angles of incidence, despite unequal amounts of radiation arriving at each angle. We find that optimized photonic mirrors will be omnidirectional in the sense that they have beneficial performance, regardless of the angle of incidence of radiation. By fulfilling these criteria, photonic mirrors can be used at different geographic locations or different tilt angles than their original optimization conditions with only marginal changes in performance. We show designs that improve energy output in Golden, Colorado by 3.7% over a full year. This work demonstrates the importance of considering real-world irradiance and weather conditions when designing optical structures for solar applications.","American Chemical Society (ACS)","","National Renewable Energy Lab.

The selection of transformer winding connection is critical especially when the PV inverter has a reactive power controller. In general, transformer winding connection can be arranged in star-star (with neutral earthed) or star-delta. The reactive power controller supports voltage regulation of the power system particularly under transient faults. Its control strategy is based on utilizing the grid currents to make a three-phase reactive unbalanced current with a small gain. The gain is determined by the system impedance. Simulation results exhibit that the control strategy works very well particularly under disturbance conditions when the transformer winding connection is star-star with both neutrals grounded. The power quality in terms of the voltage quality is improved.","","","National Renewable Energy Lab.

Many methods have been proposed for extracting the degradation rate from operational data of PV systems, but most of the published approaches are susceptible to bias due to inverter clipping, module soiling, temporary outages, seasonality, and sensor degradation. In this paper, we propose a methodology for determining PV degradation leveraging available modeled clear-sky irradiance data rather than site sensor data, and a robust year-over-year rate calculation. We show the method to provide reliable degradation rate estimates even in the case of sensor drift, data shifts, and soiling.

Multijunction solar cells rely on tunneling interconnects between subcells to enable series connection with minimal voltage loss, but tunnel junctions have never been shown using the HVPE growth method. HVPE has recently reemerged as a low-cost growth method for high-quality III-V materials and devices, including the growth of high-efficiency III-V solar cells. We previously showed single-junction GaAs solar cells with conversion efficiencies of ~24% with a path forward to equal or exceed the practical efficiency limits of crystalline Si. Moving to a multijunction device structure will allow for even higher efficiencies with minimal impact on cost, necessitating the development of tunnel interconnects. Here in this paper, we demonstrate the performance of both isolated HVPE-grown tunnel junctions, as well as single-junction GaAs solar cell structures with a tunnel junction incorporated into the contact region. We observe no degradation in device performance compared to a structure without the added junction.","IEEE","","National Renewable Energy Lab.

However, CZTS suffers from a Voc deficit, where the Voc is much lower than expected based on the band gap, which may be the result of a high concentration of point-defects in the CZTS lattice. Recently, reports have observed a low-temperature order/disorder transition by Raman and optical spectroscopies in CZTS films and is reported to describe the ordering of Cu and Zn atoms in the CZTS crystal structure. To directly determine the level of Cu/Zn ordering, we have used resonant-XRD, a site, and element specific probe of long range order. We used CZTSe films annealed just below and quenched from just above the transition temperature; based on previous work, the Cu and Zn should be ordered and highly disordered, respectively. Our data show that there is some Cu/Zn ordering near the low temperature transition but significantly less than high chemical order expected from Raman. To understand both our resonant-XRD results and the Raman results, we present a structural model that involves antiphase domain boundaries and accommodates the excess Zn within the CZTS lattice.","Wiley-Blackwell","","National Renewable Energy Lab.

In this work, we report on two of the fundamental adhesion mechanisms: van der Waals and capillary adhesion forces. The adhesion was determined using force versus distance (F-z) measurements performed with an atomic force microscope (AFM). To emulate dust interacting with the front surface of a solar panel, we measured how oxidized AFM tips, SiO<sub>2</sub> glass spheres, and real dust particles adhered to actual solar glass. The van der Waals forces were evaluated by measurements performed with zero relative humidity in a glove box, and the capillary forces were measured in a stable environment created inside the AFM enclosure with relative humidity values ranging from 18% to 80%. To simulate topographic features of the solar panels caused by factors such as cleaning and abrasion, we induced different degrees of surface roughness in the solar glass. As a result, we were able to 1) identify and quantify both the van der Waals and capillary forces, 2) establish the effects of surface roughness, relative humidity, and particle size on the adhesion mechanisms, and 3) compare adhesion forces between well-controlled particles (AFM tips and glass spheres) and real dust particles.","Elsevier","","National Renewable Energy Lab.

High substrate Na and low temperature favor GI K incorporation, while low Na and high temperature favor segregation of K at GBs. Depositing KInSe<sub>2</sub> (or KIn<sub>1-y</sub>GaySe<sub>2</sub>) by co-evaporation or KF post-deposition treatment onto CIGS reduces buffer interface recombination in the final solar cells.

A.","14 SOLAR ENERGY; 36 MATERIALS SCIENCE; thin films; doping; sputtering; optoelectronics","We report on one-step in situ codoped TiO2 thin films synthesized by cosputtering. The purpose of this acceptor-donor passivated codoping approach is to overcome the optoelectronic limitations that arise for monodoped TiO2 in photocatalytic applications. To evaluate these added benefits, the TiO2:WN thin films were characterized by different techniques. X-ray diffraction patterns and X-ray photoelectron spectral analysis revealed that both N and W dopants are mostly present in the desired substitutional locations. Additionally, the codoping approach was found to reduce the internal strain and defect density of the TiO2:WN films as compared to their monodoped TiO2:N counterparts. This defect reduction is confirmed via photocharge lifetime variation obtained using visible light flash photolysis time-resolved microwave conductivity measurements (FP-TRMC). Photocharge lifetime analysis indicated the presence of three distinct decay processes: charge trapping, recombination, and surface reactions. These characteristic lifetimes of the codoped TiO2:WN films (i.e., 0.08, 0.75, and 11.5 us, respectively) were found to be about double those of their nitrogen monodoped TiO2:N counterparts (i.e., 0.03, 0.35, and 6.8 us), quantitatively confirming the effective passivating outcome of the tungsten-nitrogen codoping approach developed here. The practicality of this method was confirmed by integrating the TiO2:WN films as photoanodes for the electro-photocatalytic, solar light driven degradation of a real pollutant (i.e., atrazine). A significant increase in the degradation kinetics, leading to a 4-fold increase in the pseudo-first-order degradation constant for the optimally doped TiO2:WN photoanodes (0.106 min-1) from the undoped TiO2-x ones (0.026 min-1), is a direct consequence of the increased photocharge lifetimes in tandem with visible light photosensitivity.","American Chemical Society","","National Renewable Energy Lab.

This TCA layer was designed to be nearly transparent, conductive in only the out-of-plane direction, and of practical adhesive strength to hold the substrates together. The series resistance was measured at 0.3 and 0.8 O cm2 for 8 and 0.2% particle coverage, respectively, while remaining over 92% was transparent in both cases. For applications in photovoltaic devices, such as mechanically stacked multijunction III-V/Si cells, a TCA with 1% particle coverage will have less than 0.5% power loss due to the resistance and less than 1% shading loss to the bottom cell.","American Chemical Society (ACS)","","National Renewable Energy Lab.

We imaged on cross sections of heavily field-degraded module areas, cored out and selected by mm-scale photoluminescence imaging. We found localized areas with abnormal carrier behavior induced by the PID defects: the apparent n-type carrier extends vertically into the absorber to ~1-2 um from the cell surface, and laterally in similar lengths; in defect-free areas, the n-type carrier extends ~0.5 um, which is consistent with the junction depth. For comparison, we also investigated areas of the same module exhibiting the least PID stress, and we found no such heavily damaged junction area. Instead, we found slightly abnormal carrier behavior, where the carrier-type inversion in the absorber did not occur, but the p-type carrier concentration changed slightly in a much smaller lateral length of ~300 nm. These nano-electrical findings may indicate a possible mechanism that the existing extended defects, which may not be significantly harmful to cell performance, can be changed by PID to heavily damaged junction areas.","Elsevier","","National Renewable Energy Lab.

Potential adopters navigate increasingly complex decision-making landscapes in their path to adoption. Much is known about the individual-level drivers of solar PV diffusion that steer adopters through this process, but relatively little is known about the evolution of these drivers as solar PV markets mature. By understanding the evolution of emerging solar PV markets over time, stakeholders in the diffusion of solar PV can increase policy effectiveness and reduce costs. This analysis uses survey data to compare two adjacent markets across a range of relevant characteristics, then models changes in the importance of local vs cosmopolitan information sources by combining theory relating market maturity to adopter behavior with event-history techniques. In younger markets, earlier, innovative adoptions that are tied to a preference for cosmopolitan information sources are more prevalent than expected, suggesting a frustrated demand for solar PV that segues into adoptions fueled by local information preferences contemporary with similar adoptions in older markets. Furthermore, the analysis concludes with policy recommendations to leverage changing consumer information preferences as markets mature.","IOP Publishing","","National Renewable Energy Lab.

"Evaluation and modeling of the potential effects of a module manufacturing anomaly","Kempe, Michael D.; Jordan, Dirk C.","14 SOLAR ENERGY; damp heat; durability; kinetics; manufacturing quality; reliability","Photovoltaic lifetime predictions are in great demand, but are exceedingly difficult to achieve with uncertainties small enough to be useful. During the construction of photovoltaic modules, small unplanned variability in materials or processes can have profound effects on module durability. Thus, continual monitoring of production quality is needed. In the subject production run, module quality, as monitored by damp heat testing, revealed a subset of modules that were prone to higher degradation rates. An assessment of the potential long-term power loss and mitigation strategies was needed. To do this, modules were exposed to variable levels of humidity and temperature with periodic monitoring. The analysis takes into account the kinetics of the degradation and the spatially and temporally varying humidity content within the module during accelerated stress testing. This is an important aspect for extrapolating laboratory results to field exposure because moisture ingress is diffusion limited in most laboratory module tests but not limited in these fielded modules. This analysis predicted that although a solder flux induce degradation mechanism is significant in accelerated stress test, this is probably an artifact of a process with a very large acceleration factor that is not likely to be significant for deployed modules. The degradation mechanism affected a limited area around the tabbing helping to minimize the effect. Furthermore, three years after the system was commissioned, the fielded modules indeed show no significant power loss.","Wiley","","National Renewable Energy Lab.

Arsenic is a promising p-type dopant; however, reproducible doping with high concentration is difficult and carrier lifetime is low. We systematically studied defect structures in As-doped CdTe using high-purity single crystal wafers to investigate the mechanisms that limit p-type doping. Two As-doped CdTe with varying acceptor density and two undoped CdTe were grown in Cd-rich and Te-rich environments. The defect structures were investigated by thermoelectric-effect spectroscopy (TEES), and first-principles calculations were used for identifying and assigning the experimentally observed defects. Measurements revealed activation of As is very low in both As-doped samples with very short lifetimes indicating strong compensation and the presence of significant carrier trapping defects. Defect studies suggest two acceptors and one donor level were introduced by As doping with activation energies at ~88 meV, ~293 meV and ~377 meV. In particular, the peak shown at ~162 K in the TEES spectra is very prominent in both As-doped samples, indicating a signature of AX-center donors. The AX-centers are believed to be responsible for most of the compensation because of their low formation energy and very prominent peak intensity in TEES spectra.","Nature Publishing Group","","National Renewable Energy Lab.

The thermal conductivity of the amorphous silicon film is in agreement with several previous reports of amorphous silicon prepared by a variety of deposition techniques. The thermal conductivity of the as-grown nanocrystalline silicon film is 70% higher and increases 35% more after an anneal at 600 degrees C. They all have similarly weak temperature dependence. Structural analysis shows that the as-grown nanocrystalline silicon is approximately 60% crystalline, nanograins and grain boundaries included. The nanograins, averaging 9.1 nm in diameter in the as-grown film, are embedded in an amorphous matrix. The grain size increases to 9.7 nm upon annealing, accompanied by the disappearance of the amorphous phase. We extend the models of grain boundary scattering of phonons with two different non-Debye dispersion relations to explain our result of nanocrystalline silicon, confirming the strong grain size dependence of heat transport for nanocrystalline materials. However, the similarity in thermal conductivity between amorphous and nanocrystalline silicon suggests the heat transport mechanisms in both structures may not be as dissimilar as we currently understand.","American Physical Society (APS)","","National Renewable Energy Lab.

However, little is known about how charge-carrier lifetime and solar cell performance in LHPs are affected by extrinsic defects (i.e., impurities), including those that are common in manufacturing environments and known to introduce deep levels in other semiconductors. Here, we evaluate the tolerance of LHP solar cells to iron introduced via intentional contamination of the feedstock and examine the root causes of the resulting efficiency losses. We find that comparable efficiency losses occur in LHPs at feedstock iron concentrations approximately 100 times higher than those in p-type silicon devices. Photoluminescence measurements correlate iron concentration with nonradiative recombination, which we attribute to the presence of deep-level iron interstitials, as calculated from first-principles, as well as iron-rich particles detected by synchrotron-based X-ray fluorescence microscopy. At moderate contamination levels, we witness prominent recovery of device efficiencies to near-baseline values after biasing at 1.4 V for 60 s in the dark. We theorize that this temporary effect arises from improved charge-carrier collection enhanced by electric fields strengthened from ion migration toward interfaces. Lastly, our results demonstrate that extrinsic defect tolerance contributes to high efficiencies in LHP solar cells, which inspires further investigation into potential large-scale manufacturing cost savings as well as the degree of overlap between intrinsic and extrinsic defect tolerance in LHPs and 'perovskite-inspired' lead-free stable alternatives.","American Chemical Society (ACS)","","National Renewable Energy Lab.

Electricity generation is simulated using GridView, then used to scale electricity-sector emissions of sulfur dioxide (SO2) and nitrogen oxides (NOX) from an existing gridded inventory of air emissions. This approach offers a novel method to leverage advanced electricity simulations with state-of-the-art emissions inventories, without necessitating recalculation of emissions for each facility. The baseline and perturbed emissions are input to the Community Multiscale Air Quality Model (CMAQ version 4.7.1) for a full accounting of time- and space-varying air quality changes associated with the 17% PV scenario. These results offer a high-value opportunity to evaluate the reduced-form AVoided Emissions and geneRation Tool (AVERT), while using AVERT to test the sensitivity of results to changing base-years and levels of solar integration. We find that average NOX and SO2 emissions across the region decrease 20% and 15%, respectively. PM2.5 concentrations decreased on average 4.7% across the Eastern U.S., with nitrate (NO3-) PM2.5 decreasing 3.7% and sulfate (SO42-) PM2.5 decreasing 9.1%. In the five largest cities in the region, we find that the most polluted days show the most significant PM2.5 decrease under the 17% PV generation scenario, and that the greatest benefits are accrued to cities in or near the Ohio River Valley. We find summer health benefits from reduced PM2.5 exposure estimated as 1424 avoided premature deaths (95% Confidence Interval (CI): 284 deaths, 2 732 deaths) or a health savings of $13.1 billion (95% CI: $0.6 billion, $43.9 billion) These results highlight the potential for renewable energy as a tool for air quality managers to support current and future health-based air quality regulations.","Elsevier","","National Renewable Energy Lab.

Important drivers include average rooftop suitability, household footprint/per-capita roof space, the quality of the solar resource, and the city's estimated electricity consumption. In addition to city-wide results, we also estimate the ability of aggregations of households to offset their electricity consumption with PV.

"The geography of solar energy in the United States: Market definition, industry structure, and choice in solar PV adoption","O’Shaughnessy, Eric; Nemet, Gregory F.; Darghouth, Naïm","14 SOLAR ENERGY; 29 ENERGY PLANNING, POLICY, AND ECONOMY; solar; market definition; spatial analysis; industry","© 2018 Elsevier Ltd The solar photovoltaic (PV) installation industry comprises thousands of firms around the world who collectively installed nearly 200 million panels in 2015. Spatial analysis of the emerging industry has received considerable attention from the literature, especially on the demand side concerning peer effects and adopter clustering. However this research area does not include similarly sophisticated spatial analysis on the supply side of the installation industry. The lack of understanding of the spatial structure of the PV installation industry leaves PV market research to rely on jurisdictional lines, such as counties, to define geographic PV markets. We develop an approach that uses the spatial distribution of installers’ activity to define geographic boundaries for PV markets. Our method is useful for PV market research and applicable in the contexts of other industries. We use our approach to demonstrate that the PV industry in the United States is spatially heterogeneous. Despite the emergence of some national-scale PV installers, installers are largely local and installer communities are unique from one region to the next. The social implications of the spatial heterogeneity of the emerging PV industry involve improving understanding of issues such as market power, industry consolidation, and how much choice potential adopters have.","Elsevier","","National Renewable Energy Lab.

High-throughput separation and purification strategies have enabled the integration of s-SWCNTs into a number of optoelectronic applications, including photovoltaics (PVs). In this Perspective, we discuss the fundamental underpinnings of two model PV interfaces involving s-SWCNTs. We first discuss s-SWCNT-fullerene heterojunctions where exciton dissociation at the donor-acceptor interface drives solar energy conversion. Next, we discuss charge extraction at the interface between s-SWCNTs and a photoexcited perovskite active layer. In each case, the use of highly enriched semiconducting SWCNT samples enables fundamental insights into the thermodynamic and kinetic mechanisms that drive the efficient conversion of solar photons into long-lived separated charges. As a result, these model systems help to establish design rules for next-generation PV devices containing well-defined organic semiconductor layers and help to frame a number of important outstanding questions that can guide future studies.","American Chemical Society (ACS)","","National Renewable Energy Lab.

"The roles of carrier concentration and interface, bulk, and grain-boundary recombination for 25% efficient CdTe solar cells","Kanevce, A.; Reese, Matthew O.; Barnes, T. M.; Jensen, S. A.; Metzger, W. K.","14 SOLAR ENERGY; 71 CLASSICAL AND QUANTUM MECHANICS, GENERAL PHYSICS; doping; II-VI semiconductors; hole density; grain boundaries; materials properties","CdTe devices have reached efficiencies of 22% due to continuing improvements in bulk material properties, including minority carrier lifetime. Device modeling has helped to guide these device improvements by quantifying the impacts of material properties and different device designs on device performance. One of the barriers to truly predictive device modeling is the interdependence of these material properties. For example, interfaces become more critical as bulk properties, particularly, hole density and carrier lifetime, increase. We present device-modeling analyses that describe the effects of recombination at the interfaces and grain boundaries as lifetime and doping of the CdTe layer change. The doping and lifetime should be priorities for maximizing open-circuit voltage (V<sub>oc</sub>) and efficiency improvements. However, interface and grain boundary recombination become bottlenecks for device performance at increased lifetime and doping levels. In conclusion, this work quantifies and discusses these emerging challenges for next-generation CdTe device efficiency.","American Institute of Physics (AIP)","","National Renewable Energy Lab.

We find direct indications for the presence of Cd–S, Cd–Se, and Cd–Se–Zn bonds at the buffer/absorber interface. Thus, we propose the formation of a mixed Cd(S,Se)– (Cd,Zn)Se interlayer.

"Promoting Morphology with a Favorable Density of States Using Diiodooctane to Improve Organic Photovoltaic Device Efficiency and Charge Carrier Lifetimes","Garner, Logan E.; Bera, Abhijit; Larson, Bryon W.; Ostrowski, David P.; Pal, Amlan J.; Braunecker, Wade A.","14 SOLAR ENERGY; 36 MATERIALS SCIENCE; processing additives; scanning tunneling spectroscopy; organic photovoltaics; morphology and nanoscale electronic properties","Due to the inherent challenges in probing nanoscale properties within bulk heterojunction (BHJ) active layers of organic photovoltaic (OPV) devices, the relationship between morphology and nanoscale electronic structure is not well understood. Here, we employ scanning tunneling microscopy (STM) dI/dV imaging and localized density of states (DOS) spectra to investigate the influence of additives on morphology in a high-performance OPV system. In short, we are able to correlate the use of diiodooctane (DIO) additive with significant changes to the distribution of the localized DOS, most notably a broader distribution of PCE10 polymer HOMO levels and PC70BM fullerene LUMO levels, as well as significantly smaller domain sizes and significantly higher overall device efficiencies. We further correlate this data with a nearly 3-fold increase in charge carrier lifetimes in the active layer when DIO is employed, determined by time-resolved microwave conductivity (TRMC) measurements. In conclusion, the results are consistent with the growing body of literature evidence that DIO promotes the formation of a polymer/fullerene mixed phase and therefore highlight the unique information that this combination of techniques can provide when investigating OPV active layer morphology.","American Chemical Society (ACS)","","National Renewable Energy Lab.

The PL images show differing degrees of degradation across the module and are less sensitive to effects of shunting and resistance that appear on the EL images. Regions of varying degradation are chosen based on avoiding pre-existing shunt defects. These regions are evaluated using time-of-flight secondary ion-mass spectrometry and Kelvin probe force microscopy.

This can be achieved by reducing the production of waste heat or by improving the rejection of waste heat. We tested, using a combination of simulation and experiment, several thermal modifications in each category. To predict operating temperature and energy yield changes in response to changes to the module, we implemented a physics-based transient simulation framework based almost entirely on measured properties. The most effective thermal modifications reduced the production of waste heat by reflecting unusable light from the cell or the module. Consistent with previous results and verified in this work through year-long simulations, the ideal reflector resulted in an annual irradiance-weighted temperature reduction of 3.8 K for crystalline silicon (c-Si). Our results illustrate that more realistic reflector concepts must balance detrimental optical effects with the intended thermal effects to realize the optimal energy production advantage. Methods improving thermal conductivity or back-side emissivity showed only modest improvements of less than 1 K. We also studied a GaAs module, which uses high-efficiency and high-subbandgap reflectivity to operate at an annual irradiance-weighted temperature 12 K cooler than that of a c-Si module under the same conditions.","IEEE","","National Renewable Energy Lab.

We report for the first time on measurements on thin-film cadmium telluride using this technique, including the determination of effective carrier diffusion length, as well as the first near-field imaging of the effect of a single localized defect on carrier transport and recombination in a GaAs heterostructure. Furthermore, by changing the scanning setup, we were able to demonstrate near-field cathodoluminescence (CL), and correlated the results with standard CL measurements. In conclusion, the TI technique shows great potential for mapping transport properties in solar cell materials with high spatial resolution.","Elsevier","","National Renewable Energy Lab.

"Significant Improvements in Pyranometer Nighttime Offsets Using High-Flow DC Ventilation","Michalsky, Joseph J.; Kutchenreiter, Mark; Long, Charles N.","14 SOLAR ENERGY; 47 OTHER INSTRUMENTATION; pyranometer; offsets; climate records; data processing; in situ atmospheric observations; instrumentation/sensors; quality assurance/control; surface observations","<title>Abstract</title> <p>Ventilators are used to keep the domes of pyranometers clean and dry, but they affect the nighttime offset as well. This paper examines different ventilation strategies. For the several commercial single-black-detector pyranometers with ventilators examined here, high-flow-rate [50 cubic feet per minute (CFM) and higher] 12-VDC (where VDC refers to voltage direct current) fans lower the offsets, lower the scatter, and improve the predictability of the offsets during the night compared with lower-flow-rate (35 CFM) 120-VAC (where VAC refers to voltage alternating current) fans operated in the same ventilator housings. Black-and-white pyranometers sometimes show improvement with DC ventilation, but in some cases DC ventilation makes the offsets slightly worse. Since the offsets for these black-and-white pyranometers are always small, usually no more than 1 W m−2, whether AC or DC ventilated, changing their ventilation to higher CFM DC ventilation is not imperative. Future work should include all major manufacturers of pyranometers and unventilated and ventilated pyranometers. An important outcome of future research will be to clarify under what circumstances nighttime data can be used to predict daytime offsets.</p>","American Meteorological Society","","National Renewable Energy Lab.

Some of the local maxima are related to the bottom subcell bandgap and are already well understood: As the bottom subcell bandgap is varied, a local efficiency maximum is produced wherever the bottom cell bandgap crosses an atmospheric absorption band. The optimal cell designs at these local maxima are generally current matched, such that all subcells have nearly the same short-circuit current. We systematically describe additional local maxima that occur wherever an upper subcell bandgap encounters an atmospheric absorption band. Moreover, these local maxima are not current matched and become more prevalent as the number of junctions increases, complicating the solution space for five-junction and six-junction designs. A systematic framework for describing this complexity is developed, and implications for numerical convergence are discussed.","Wiley","","National Renewable Energy Lab.

"Metal nano-grids for transparent conduction in solar cells","Muzzillo, Christopher P.","14 SOLAR ENERGY; transparent conduction; metal grid; metal nano-grid; transparent conducting oxide; series resistance; transmittance","A general procedure for predicting metal grid performance in solar cells was developed. Unlike transparent conducting oxides (TCOs) or other homogeneous films, metal grids induce more resistance in the neighbor layer. The resulting balance of transmittance, neighbor and grid resistance was explored in light of cheap lithography advances that have enabled metal nano-grid (MNG) fabrication. The patterned MNGs have junction resistances and degradation rates that are more favorable than solution-synthesized metal nanowires. Neighbor series resistance was simulated by the finite element method, although a simpler analytical model was sufficient in most cases. Finite-difference frequency-domain transmittance simulations were performed for MNGs with minimum wire width (w) of 50 nm, but deviations from aperture transmittance were small in magnitude. Depending on the process, MNGs can exhibit increased series resistance as w is decreased. However, numerous experimental reports have already achieved transmittance-MNG sheet resistance trade-offs comparable to TCOs. The transmittance, neighbor and MNG series resistances were used to parameterize a grid fill factor for a solar cell. In conclusion, this new figure of merit was used to demonstrate that although MNGs have only been employed in low efficiency solar cells, substantial gains in performance are predicted for decreased w in all high efficiency absorber technologies.","Elsevier","","National Renewable Energy Lab.

We find that this charge transportation imbalance is originated from the poor electrical conductivity of the low-temperature PEALD SnO<sub>2</sub> ESL. We further discover that a facile low-temperature thermal annealing of SnO<sub>2</sub> ESLs can effectively improve the electrical mobility of low-temperature PEALD SnO<sub>2</sub> ESLs and consequently significantly reduce or even eliminate the J-V hysteresis. With the reduction of J-V hysteresis and optimization of deposition process, planar PVSCs with stabilized output powers up to 20.3% are achieved.

In this work, we reflect on the accuracy and prospects of these new design criteria through a combined experimental and theoretical approach. We construct a model to extract photoluminescence lifetimes of six of these candidate PV absorbers, including four (InI, SbSI, SbSeI, and BiOI) for which time-resolved photoluminescence has not been previously reported. The lifetimes of all six candidate materials exceed 1 ns, a threshold for promising early stage PV device performance. However, there are variations between these materials, and none achieve lifetimes as high as those of the hybrid lead-halide perovskites, suggesting that the heuristics for defect-tolerant semiconductors are incomplete. Here, we explore this through first-principles point defect calculations and Shockley-Read-Hall recombination models to describe the variation between the measured materials. In light of these insights, we discuss the evolution of screening criteria for defect tolerance and high-performance PV materials.","American Chemical Society (ACS)","","Energy Frontier Research Centers (EFRC) (United States).

The first is the sensitivity to using hourly averaged as opposed to subhourly solar-insolation data. The second is the sensitivity to errors in recording and interpreting load data. The third is the sensitivity to using modeled as opposed to measured solar-insolation data. We demonstrate that capacity-value estimates of solar are sensitive to all three of these factors, with potentially large errors in the capacity-value estimate in a particular year. If multiple years of data are available, the biases introduced by using hourly averaged solar-insolation can be smoothed out. Multiple years of data will not necessarily address the other data-related issues that we examine. Our analysis calls into question the accuracy of a number of solar capacity-value estimates relying exclusively on modeled solar-insolation data that are reported in the literature (including our own previous works). Our analysis also suggests that multiple years' historical data should be used for remunerating solar generators for their capacity value in organized wholesale electricity markets.","IEEE","","National Renewable Energy Lab.

Prediction of Ga profiles using classic diffusion equations is not possible because In and Ga atoms occupy the same lattice sites and thus diffuse interdependently, and there is not yet a detailed experimental knowledge of the chemical potential as a function of composition that describes this interaction. Here, we show how diffusion equations can be modified to account for site sharing between In and Ga atoms. The analysis has been implemented in an Excel spreadsheet, and outputs predicted Cu, In, and Ga profiles for entered deposition recipes. A single set of diffusion coefficients and activation energies are chosen, such that simulated elemental profiles track with published data and those from this study.

"Determining interface properties limiting open-circuit voltage in heterojunction solar cells","Brandt, Riley E.; Mangan, Niall M.; Li, Jian V.; Lee, Yun Seog; Buonassisi, Tonio","14 SOLAR ENERGY; activation energies; solar cells; heterojunctions; band gap; illumination","The development of new thin-film photovoltaic (PV) absorbers is often hindered by the search for an optimal heterojunction contact; an unoptimized contact may be mistaken for poor quality of the underlying absorber, making it difficult to assess the reasons for poor performance. Therefore, quantifying the loss in device efficiency and open-circuit voltage (VOC) as a result of the interface is a critical step in evaluating a new material. In the present work, we fabricate thin-film PV devices using cuprous oxide (Cu2O), with several different n-type heterojunction contacts. Their current-voltage characteristics are measured over a range of temperatures and illumination intensities (JVTi). We quantify the loss in VOC due to the interface and determine the effective energy gap at the interface. The effective interface gap measured by JVTi matches the gap measured by X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy, albeit with higher energy resolution and an order of magnitude faster. We discuss potential artifacts in JVTi measurements and areas where analytical models are insufficient. Applying JVTi to complete devices, rather than incomplete material stacks, suggests that it can be a quick, accurate method to assess the loss due to unoptimized interface band offsets in thin-film PV devices.","American Institute of Physics (AIP)","","Energy Frontier Research Centers (EFRC) (United States).

From this perspective, the electrodeposition method is one of the most suitable processes for preparing large-area devices because it is an already commercialized process with proven controllability and scalability. Here, a highly uniform NiO<sub>x</sub> layer prepared by electrochemical deposition is reported as an efficient hole-extraction layer of a p-i-n-type planar PSC with a large active area of >1 cm<sup>2</sup>. It is demonstrated that the increased surface roughness of the NiO<sub>x</sub> layer, achieved by controlling the deposition current density, facilitates the hole extraction at the interface between perovskite and NiO<sub>x</sub>, and thus increases the fill factor and the conversion efficiency. The electrochemically deposited NiO<sub>x</sub> layer also exhibits extremely uniform thickness and morphology, leading to highly efficient and uniform large-area PSCs.

The analysis is based on simulations of PV installations over system lifetime at various degradation rates. It is shown how module-level or submodule-level power converters can mitigate variations in cell degradation over time, effectively increasing the system lifespan by 5-10 years compared with the nominal 25-year lifetime. An important aspect typically overlooked when characterizing such improvements is the reliability of distributed power electronics, as power converter failures may not only diminish energy yield improvements but also adversely affect the overall system operation. Failure models are developed, and power electronics reliability is taken into account in this work, in order to provide a more comprehensive view of the opportunities and limitations offered by distributed power electronics in PV systems. Lastly, it is shown how a differential power-processing approach achieves the best mismatch mitigation performance and the least susceptibility to converter faults.","Wiley","","National Renewable Energy Lab.

"Laser lift-off scribing of the CZTSe thin-film solar cells at different pulse durations","Markauskas, Edgaras; Gečys, Paulius; Repins, Ingrid; Beall, Carolyn; Račiukaitis, Gediminas","14 SOLAR ENERGY; kesterite; CZTSe; lift-off; laser ablation","Here, the transition to fully sized solar modules requires additional three-step laser structuring processes to preserve small-scale cell efficiencies over the large areas. The adjacent cell isolation (the P3 scribe) was found to be the most sensitive process in the case of laser induced damage. The laser induced layer lift-off mechanism seems to be a very attractive process for the P3 patterning, since almost all the laser affected material is removed by mechanical spallation. However, a laser induced layer spallation behavior together with scribe electrical validation under the different laser pulse durations was not investigated extensively in the past. Therefore, we report our novel results on the P2 and P3 laser lift-off processing of the Cu<sub>2</sub>ZnSn(S, Se<sub>4</sub>) (CZTSe) thin-film solar cells covering the pulse duration range from 300 fs to 60 ps. Shorter sub-ps pulses enabled us to process smaller P2 and P3 craters, although the lift-off threshold fluences were higher compared to the longer ps pulses. In the case of the layer lift-off, the laser radiation had to penetrate through the layer stack down to the CZTSe/Mo interface. At shorter sub-ps pulses, the nonlinear effects triggered absorption of the laser radiation in the bulk of the material, resulting in increased damage of the CZTSe layer. The Raman measurements confirmed the CZTSe surface stoichiometry changes for shorter pulses. Furthermore, shorter pulses induced higher electrical conductivity of a scribe, resulting in lower photo-electrical efficiency during the mini-module simulation. In the case of the P3 lift-off scribing, the 10 ps pulses were more favorable than shorter femtosecond pulses.","Elsevier","","National Renewable Energy Lab.

Previous work has consistently demonstrated that the solubilizing side-chains of the donor material affect these properties and device performance in a non-trivial way. Here, using Time-Resolved Microwave Conductivity (TRMC), we show by direct measurements of carrier lifetimes that the choice of side chains can also make a substantial difference in photocarrier dynamics. We have previously demonstrated a correlation between peak photoconductance measured by TRMC and device efficiencies; here, we demonstrate that TRMC photocarrier dynamics have an important bearing on device performance in a case study of devices made from donor materials with linear vs. branched side-chains and with variable active layer thicknesses. We use Grazing-Incidence Wide Angle X-ray Scattering to elucidate the cause of the different carrier lifetimes as a function of different aggregation behavior in the polymers. Consequently, the results help establish TRMC as a technique for screening OPV donor materials whose devices maintain performance in thick active layers (>250 nm) designed to improve light harvesting, film reproducibility, and ease of processing.","Elsevier","","National Renewable Energy Lab.

The shift arises from the fact that the measured reflectance at the front surface includes a superposition of waves reflecting from the front and back surfaces. We quantify the magnitude of the apparent shift and discuss the errors that can result in determination of quantities such as the photocurrent. Because of this apparent shift, it is important that the bandgap be determined from the external quantum efficiency.","American Institute of Physics (AIP)","","National Renewable Energy Lab.

"Structural and chemical evolution of the CdS:O window layer during individual CdTe solar cell processing steps","Abbas, A.; Meysing, D. M.; Reese, M. O.; Barnes, T. M.; Walls, J. M.; Wolden, C. A.","14 SOLAR ENERGY; 36 MATERIALS SCIENCE; oxygenated CdS; CdTe solar cells; cadmium sulfate; TEM","Oxygenated cadmium sulfide (CdS:O) is often used as the n-type window layer in high-performance CdTe heterojunction solar cells. The as-deposited layer prepared by reactive sputtering is XRD amorphous, with a bulk composition of CdS0.8O1.2. Recently it was shown that this layer undergoes significant transformation during device fabrication, but the roles of the individual high temperature processing steps was unclear. In this work high resolution transmission electron microscopy coupled to elemental analysis was used to understand the evolution of the heterojunction region through the individual high temperature fabrication steps of CdTe deposition, CdCl2 activation, and back contact activation. It is found that during CdTe deposition by close spaced sublimation at 600 degrees C the CdS:O film undergoes recrystallization, accompanied by a significant (~30%) reduction in thickness. It is observed that oxygen segregates during this step, forming a bi-layer morphology consisting of nanocrystalline CdS adjacent to the tin oxide contact and an oxygen-rich layer adjacent to the CdTe absorber. This bilayer structure is then lost during the 400 degrees C CdCl2 treatment where the film transforms into a heterogeneous structure with cadmium sulfate clusters distributed randomly throughout the window layer. The thickness of window layer remains essentially unchanged after CdCl2 treatment, but a ~25 nm graded interfacial layer between CdTe and the window region is formed. Finally, the rapid thermal processing step used to activate the back contact was found to have a negligible impact on the structure or composition of the heterojunction region.","Elsevier","","National Renewable Energy Lab.

Here in this paper, we suggest a new protocol for QD film deposition using electrical double-layered PbS QD inks, prepared by solution-phase ligand exchange using methyl ammonium lead iodide (MAPbI<sub>3</sub>). The films are deposited by the supersonic spraying technique, which facilitates the rapid evaporation of the solvent and the subsequent deposition of the PbS QD ink without requiring a post-deposition annealing treatment for solvent removal. The film thickness could be readily controlled by varying the number of spraying sweeps made across the substrate. This spray deposition process yields high-quality n-type QD films quickly (within 1 min) while minimizing the amount of the PbS QD ink used to less than 5 mg for one device (300-nm-thick absorbing layer, 2.5 x 2.5 cm<sup>2</sup>). Further, the formation of an additional p-layer by treatment with mercaptopropionic acid allows for facile hole extraction from the QD films, resulting in a power conversion efficiency of 3.7% under 1.5 AM illumination.","Nature Publishing Group","","National Renewable Energy Lab.

The various lens specimens were deployed for 20, 27, and 22 years, respectively. Optical characterizations included lens efficiency (Solar Simulator instrument), material transmittance and haze (of coupons cut from veteran lenses, then measured again after their faceted back surface was polished, and then measured again after the incident front surface was polished), and direct transmittance (as a function of detector's acceptance angle, using the Very Low Angular Beam Spread ('VLABS') instrument). Lens efficiency measurements compared the central region to the entire lens, also using hot and cold mirror measurements to diagnose differences in performance. A series of subsequent characterizations was performed because a decrease in performance of greater than 10% was observed for some of the veteran lenses. The optimal focal distance of the lenses was quantified using the Solar Simulator, and then correlated to lens curvature using a recently developed measurement technique. Surface roughness was examined using atomic force microscopy and scanning electron microscopy. Facet geometry (tip and valley radius) was quantified on cross-sectioned specimens.

"Beyond 11% efficient sulfide kesterite Cu<sub>2</sub>Zn<sub><i>x</i></sub>Cd<sub>1–<i>x</i></sub>SnS<sub>4</sub> solar cell: Effects of cadmium alloying","Yan, Chang; Sun, Kaiwen; Huang, Jialiang; Johnston, Steve; Liu, Fangyang; Veettil, Binesh Puthen; Sun, Kaile; Pu, Aobo; Zhou, Fangzhou; Stride, John A.; Green, Martin A.; Hao, Xiaojing","14 SOLAR ENERGY; thin film solar cells; efficiency; alloying; performance","Here, kesterite Cu<sub>2</sub>ZnSnS<sub>4</sub> (CZTS) thin-film solar cells have drawn worldwide attention because of outstanding performance and earth-abundant constituents. However, problems such as coexistence of complex secondary phases, the band tailing issue, short minority lifetime, bulk defects, and undesirable band alignment at p-n interfaces need to be addressed for further efficiency improvement. In this regard, Cd alloying shows promise for dealing with some of these problems. In this work, a beyond 11% efficient Cd-alloyed CZTS solar cell is achieved, and the effects of Cd-alloying and mechanism underpinning the performance improvement have been investigated. The introduction of Cd can significantly reduce the band tailing issue, which is confirmed by the reduction in the difference between the photoluminescence peak and optical band gap (E<sub>g</sub>) as well as decreased Urbach energy. The microstructure, minority lifetime, and electrical properties of CZTS absorber are greatly improved by Cd alloying. Further XPS analyses show that the partial Cd alloying slightly reduces the band gap of CZTS via elevating the valence band maximum of CZTS. This suggests that there are opportunities for further efficiency improvement by engineering the absorber and the associated interface with the buffer.","American Chemical Society (ACS)","","National Renewable Energy Lab.

Cells, for which the substrate was treated at 650 °C to induce alkali diffusion from the substrate prior to absorber deposition, exhibited high open-circuit voltage (758 mV) and efficiency (18.2%) and also exhibited a 50 to 100-nm-thick ordered vacancy compound layer at the metallurgical junction. Surprisingly, these high-temperature samples exhibited higher concentrations of K at the junction (1.8 at.%) than post-deposition treatment samples (0.4 at.%). A model that uses Ga/(Ga + In) and Cu/(Ga + In) profiles to predict bandgaps (+/-17.9 meV) of 22 Cu(In,Ga)Se2 solar cells reported in literature was discussed and ultimately used to predict band properties at the nanoscale by using atom probe tomography data. The high-temperature samples exhibited a greater drop in the valence band maximum (200 meV) due to a lower Cu/(Ga + In) ratio than the post-deposition treatment samples. There was an anticorrelation of K concentrations and Cu/(Ga + In) ratios for all samples, regardless of processing conditions. In conclusion, changes in elemental profiles at the active junctions correlate well with the electrical behaviour of these devices.","Wiley","","National Renewable Energy Lab.

Here in this paper we present a strategy for III-V photocatalysis that can circumvent these difficulties via printed assemblies of epitaxially grown compound semiconductors. A thin film stack of GaAs-based epitaxial materials is released from the growth wafer and printed onto a non-native transparent substrate to form an integrated photocatalytic electrode for solar hydrogen generation. The heterogeneously integrated electrode configuration together with specialized epitaxial design serve to decouple the material interfaces for illumination and electrocatalysis. Subsequently, this allows independent control and optimization of light absorption, carrier transport, charge transfer, and material stability. Using this approach, we construct a series-connected wireless tandem system of GaAs photoelectrodes and demonstrate 13.1% solar-to-hydrogen conversion efficiency of unassisted-mode water splitting.","Nature Publishing Group","","National Renewable Energy Lab.

"Corrosion resistance of alumina forming alloys against molten chlorides for energy production.

G.; Tirawat, R.; Turchi, C.; Huddleston, W.","14 SOLAR ENERGY; 47 OTHER INSTRUMENTATION; molten salts; corrosion; chlorides; alumina forming alloys; oxygen; oxidation","Next-generation power systems require higher temperatures to increase the efficiency of electricity production in the power block. Concentrating solar power (CSP) technology is looking for high temperature thermal fluids able to work in the range of 550–750 °C. Molten chlorides containing NaCl, KCl, MgCl<sub>2</sub>, and/or ZnCl<sub>2</sub> are being considered for solar receivers and/or sensible- or latent- thermal energy storage systems. Vapor pressures of chlorides are high enough that in combination with oxygen gaseous compounds will produce a harsh atmosphere that is generally very aggressive to common chromia forming alloys. Corrosion mitigations must consider a solution in which both zones (immersed in fluid and exposed to vapor phase) will be protected. This could easily be obtained using alloy surface modification approaches. Surface passivation, produced after pre-oxidation treatments, of alumina forming alloys (Inconel 702, Haynes 224 and Kanthal APMT) was evaluated in molten 35.59 wt% MgCl2 – 64.41 wt% KCl thermally cycled from 550 °C to 700 °C in flowing Ar and static zero air (ZA) atmospheres. Electrochemical impedance spectroscopy tests and metallographic characterization showed that the best performing alloy was pre-oxidized In702 in ZA at 1050 °C for 4 h due to the formation of protective, dense and continuous alumina layers. The alumina layers were unstable when flowing Ar was used as the inert atmosphere during corrosion evaluations. Corrosion results in static ZA are promising for next-generation CSP applications using molten chlorides because alumina scales were stable after 185 h of immersion in the oxygen-containing atmosphere. Alumina layers in pre-oxidized Al-FA In702 grew from 5 µm (before immersion) to 13 µm (after 185 h of immersion). As a result, the use of these alloys could be commercial feasibility and cost-effective because of the possibility of using oxygen-containing atmospheres instead of keeping enclosed systems with inert atmospheres to protect alloys from corrosion in molten chlorides.","Elsevier","","National Renewable Energy Lab.

Although there are many models for partially shaded PV arrays, there is a lack of information available regarding their accuracy and uncertainty when compared with actual field performance. This work assesses the recorded performance of 46 residential PV systems, equipped with either string-level or module-level inverters, under a variety of shading conditions. We compare their energy production data to annual PV performance predictions, with a focus on the practical models developed here for National Renewable Energy Laboratory's system advisor model software. This includes assessment of shade extent on each PV system by using traditional onsite surveys and newer 3D obstruction modelling. The electrical impact of shade is modelled by either a nonlinear performance model or assumption of linear impact with shade extent, depending on the inverter type. When applied to the fleet of residential PV systems, performance is predicted with median annual bias errors of 2.5% or less, for systems with up to 20% estimated shading loss. The partial shade models are not found to add appreciable uncertainty to annual predictions of energy production for this fleet of systems but do introduce a monthly root-mean-square error of approximately 4%-9% due to seasonal effects. Here the use of a detailed 3D model results in similar or improved accuracy over site survey methods, indicating that, with proper description of shade obstructions, modelling of partially shaded PV arrays can be done completely remotely, potentially saving time and cost.","Wiley","","National Renewable Energy Lab.

Economical hydrogen production demands high conversion efficiency to reduce balance-of-systems costs. For sufficient photovoltage, water-splitting efficiency is proportional to the device photocurrent, which can be tuned by judicious selection and integration of optimal semiconductor bandgaps. Here, we demonstrate highly efficient, immersed water-splitting electrodes enabled by inverted metamorphic epitaxy and a transparent graded buffer that allows the bandgap of each junction to be independently varied.

"High-performance formamidinium-based perovskite solar cells via microstructure-mediated δ-to-α phase transformation","Liu, Tanghao; Zong, Yingxia; Zhou, Yuanyuan; Yang, Mengjin; Li, Zhen; Game, Onkar S.; Zhu, Kai; Zhu, Rui; Gong, Qihuang; Padture, Nitin P.","14 SOLAR ENERGY; 36 MATERIALS SCIENCE; phase transformation; organic-inorganic; perovskite thin films; solar cells","The δ → α phase transformation is a crucial step in the solution-growth process of formamidinium-based lead triiodide (FAPbI<sub>3</sub>) hybrid organic–inorganic perovskite (HOIP) thin films for perovskite solar cells (PSCs). Because the addition of cesium (Cs) stabilizes the α phase of FAPbI<sub>3</sub>-based HOIPs, here our research focuses on FAPbI<sub>3</sub>(Cs) thin films. We show that having a large grain size in the δ-FAPbI<sub>3</sub>(Cs) non-perovskite intermediate films is essential for the growth of high-quality α-FAPbI<sub>3</sub>(Cs) HOIP thin films. Here grain coarsening and phase transformation occur simultaneously during the thermal annealing step. A large starting grain size in the δ-FAPbI<sub>3</sub>(Cs) thin films suppresses grain coarsening, precluding the formation of voids at the final α-FAPbI<sub>3</sub>(Cs)–substrate interfaces. PSCs based on the interface void-free α-FAPbI<sub>3</sub>(Cs) HOIP thin films are much more efficient and stable in the ambient atmosphere. This interesting finding inspired us to develop a simple room-temperature aging method for preparing coarse-grained δ-FAPbI<sub>3</sub>(Cs) intermediate films, which are subsequently converted to coarse-grained, high-quality α-FAPbI<sub>3</sub>(Cs) HOIP thin films. As a result, this study highlights the importance of microstructure meditation in the processing of formamidinium-based PSCs.","American Chemical Society (ACS)","","National Renewable Energy Lab.

"Data challenges in estimating the capacity value of solar photovoltaics","Gami, Dhruv; Sioshansi, Ramteen; Denholm, Paul","14 SOLAR ENERGY; capacity value; photovoltaic (PV) solar power generation; power system reliability","We examine the robustness of solar capacity-value estimates to three important data issues. The first is the sensitivity to using hourly averaged as opposed to subhourly solar-insolation data. The second is the sensitivity to errors in recording and interpreting load data. The third is the sensitivity to using modeled as opposed to measured solar-insolation data. We demonstrate that capacity-value estimates of solar are sensitive to all three of these factors, with potentially large errors in the capacity-value estimate in a particular year. If multiple years of data are available, the biases introduced by using hourly averaged solar-insolation can be smoothed out. Multiple years of data will not necessarily address the other data-related issues that we examine. Our analysis calls into question the accuracy of a number of solar capacity-value estimates relying exclusively on modeled solar-insolation data that are reported in the literature (including our own previous works). Lastly, our analysis also suggests that multiple years’ historical data should be used for remunerating solar generators for their capacity value in organized wholesale electricity markets.","IEEE","","National Renewable Energy Lab.

Complementary refractive index spectra are determined by spectroscopic ellipsometry at 300K. A direct gap of 1.68eV is associated with the absorption onset at 300K, which strengthens continuously and reaches a magnitude of 3.5 x 10<sup>5</sup>cm<sup>-1</sup> at 2.7eV, suggesting potential for photovoltaic applications. Notably, the direct gap redshifts by just 24meV between 4.2 and 300K, giving an atypically small band-gap temperature coefficient dE<sub>g</sub>/dT of -0.082meV/K. Additionally, the band structure, dielectric function, phonon dispersion, linear expansion, and heat capacity are calculated using density functional theory; remarkable similarities between the experimental and calculated refractive index spectra support the accuracy of these calculations, which indicate beneficially low hole effective masses and potential negative thermal expansion below 50K. To assess the lattice expansion contribution to the band-gap temperature-dependence, a quasiharmonic model fit to the observed lattice contraction finds a monotonically decreasing linear expansion (descending past 10<sup>-6</sup>K<sup>-1</sup> below 80K), while estimating the Debye temperature, lattice heat capacity, and Gruneisen parameter. Accounting for lattice and electron-phonon contributions to the observed band-gap evolution suggests average phonon energies that are qualitatively consistent with predicted maxima in the phonon density of states. Furthermore, as band-edge temperature-dependence has significant consequences for device performance, copper nitride should be well suited for applications that require a largely temperature-invariant band gap.","American Physical Society","","National Renewable Energy Lab.

We designed a sample holder to simultaneously accommodate 1000-V HV and 200 degrees C HT stressing. Three technical challenges have been overcome along with the development: thermal drift at HT, HV interference with measurement, and arc discharge caused by HV. We demonstrated no observable measurement artifact under the stress conditions.

G.; Tirawat, R.; Turchi, C.; Huddleston, W.","14 SOLAR ENERGY; 36 MATERIALS SCIENCE; molten salts; corrosion; chlorides; alumina forming alloys; alumina; oxidation","Advanced components in next-generation concentrating solar power (CSP) applications will require advanced heat-transfer fluids and thermal-storage materials that work from about 550 °C to at least 720 °C, for integration with advanced power-conversion systems. To reach the cost target, less-expensive salts such as molten chlorides have been identified as high-temperature fluid candidates. High-strength alloys need to be identified and their mechanical and chemical degradation must be minimized to be used in CSP applications. Approaches for corrosion mitigation need to be investigated and optimized to drive down corrosion rates to acceptable levels—in the order of tens of micrometers per year—for achieving a long system lifetime of at least 30 years. Surface passivation is a good corrosion mitigation approach because the alloy could then be exposed to both the liquid and the vapor phases of the salt mixture. In this investigation, we pre-oxidized the alumina-forming alloys Inconel 702, Haynes 224, and Kanthal APMT at different temperatures, dwelling times, and atmospheres to produce the passivation by forming protective oxides at the surface. The pretreated alloys were later corroded in molten MgCl2 – 64.41 wt% KCl at 700 °C in a flowing Ar atmosphere. We performed electrochemical techniques such as open-circuit potential followed by a potentiodynamic polarization sweep and conventional long-term weight-change tests to down-select the best-performing alloy and pre-oxidation conditions. The best corrosion results were obtained for In702 pre-oxidized in zero air at 1050 °C for 4 h. Finally, metallographic characterization of the pre-oxidized alloys and of the corroded surfaces showed that the formation of dense and uniform alumina scale during the pre-oxidation appears to protect the alloy from attack by molten chloride.","Elsevier","","National Renewable Energy Lab.

Given parameters such as start-up and shut-down penalties, expected electricity price profiles, solar availability, and system interoperability requirements, this paper seeks a profit-maximizing solution that determines start-up and shut-down times for the power cycle and solar receiver, and the times at which to dispatch stored and instantaneous quantities of energy over a 48-h horizon at hourly fidelity. The mixed-integer linear program (MIP) is subject to constraints including: (i) minimum and maximum rates of start-up and shut-down, (ii) energy balance, including energetic state of the system as a whole and its components, (iii) logical rules governing the operational modes of the power cycle and solar receiver, and (iv) operational consistency between time periods. The novelty in this work lies in the successful integration of a dispatch optimization model into a detailed techno-economic analysis tool, specifically, the National Renewable Energy Laboratory's System Advisor Model (SAM). The MIP produces an optimized operating strategy, historically determined via a heuristic. Using several market electricity pricing profiles, we present comparative results for a system with and without dispatch optimization, indicating that dispatch optimization can improve plant profitability by 5-20% and thereby alter the economics of concentrating solar power technology. While we examine a molten salt power tower system, this analysis is equally applicable to the more mature concentrating solar parabolic trough system with thermal energy storage.","Elsevier","","National Renewable Energy Lab.

In this work, we explore alternative n-type contact layer candidates that could be widely applicable to a variety of new absorbers. We use theory to calculate the band edge tuning provided by a variety of II-VI alloy systems, and select the (Cd,Zn)S system as one that affords a wide range of conduction band tuning. The synthesis of (Cd,Zn)S alloys is explored using atomic layer deposition, which afforded precise compositional control and produced crystalline thin films.

"Characteristics of low-priced solar PV systems in the U.S.","Nemet, Gregory F.; O’Shaughnessy, Eric; Wiser, Ryan; Darghouth, Naïm; Barbose, Galen; Gillingham, Ken; Rai, Varun","14 SOLAR ENERGY; 29 ENERGY PLANNING, POLICY, AND ECONOMY; subsidies; solar; PV; price dispersion; technological change","Despite impressive declines in average prices, there is wide dispersion in the prices of U.S. solar photovoltaic (PV) systems; prices span more than a factor of four. What are the characteristics of the systems with low-prices? Using detailed characteristics of 42,611 small-scale (<15 kW) PV systems installed in 15 U.S. states during 2013, we identify the most important factors that make a system likely to be low-priced (LP). Comparing LP and non-LP systems, we find statistically significant differences in nearly all characteristics for which we have data. Logit and probit model results robustly indicate that LP systems are associated with: markets with few active installers; experienced installers; customer ownership; large systems; retrofits; and thin-film, low-efficiency, and Chinese modules. We also find significant differences across states, with LP systems much more likely to occur in some states, such as Arizona, New Jersey, and New Mexico, and less likely in others, such as California. Our focus on the left tail of the price distribution provides implications for policy that are distinct from recent studies of mean prices. While those studies find that PV subsidies increase mean prices, we find that subsidies also generate LP systems. PV subsidies appear to simultaneously shift and broaden the price distribution. Much of this broadening occurs in a particular location, northern California.","Elsevier","","National Renewable Energy Lab.

Here, we find that higher processing humidity leads to the emergence of increased conductivity at the grain boundaries but also correlates with the appearance of resistive grains that contain PbI<sub>2</sub>. Deteriorated films show larger and increasingly insulating grain boundaries as well as spatially localized regions of reduced conductivity within grains. These results suggest that while humidity during film fabrication primarily benefits device properties due to the passivation of traps at the grain boundaries and self-doping, it also results in the emergence of PbI<sub>2</sub>-containing grains. We further establish that MAPI film deterioration under ambient conditions proceeds via the spatially localized breakdown of film conductivity, both at grain boundaries and within grains, due to local variations in susceptibility to deterioration. These results confirm that PbI<sub>2</sub> has both beneficial and adverse effects on device performance and provide new means for device optimization by revealing spatial variations in sample conductivity as well as morphological differences in resistance to sample deterioration.","American Chemical Society","","National Renewable Energy Lab.

Non-destructive measurement techniques, with high spatial resolution, capable of correlating composition and/or structure with device properties, are few and far between. For the case of polycrystalline and inhomogeneous materials, the added challenge is that nanoscale resolution is in general not compatible with the large sampling areas necessary to have a statistical representation of the specimen under study. For the study of grain cores and grain boundaries in polycrystalline solar absorbers this is of particular importance since their dissimilar behavior and variability throughout the samples makes it difficult to draw conclusions and ultimately optimize the material. In this study, we present a nanoscale in-operando approach based on the multimodal utilization of synchrotron nano x-ray fluorescence and x-ray beam induced current collected for grain core and grain boundary areas and correlated pixel-by-pixel in fully operational Cu(In(1-x)Gax)Se2Cu(In(1-x)Gax)Se2 solar cells. We observe that low gallium cells have grain boundaries that over perform compared to the grain cores and high gallium cells have boundaries that under perform. These results demonstrate how nanoscale correlative X-ray microscopy can guide research pathways towards grain engineering low cost, high efficiency solar cells.","Elsevier","","National Renewable Energy Lab.

The advent of these materials for solar applications has led to widespread interest in understanding the key enabling properties of these materials. This has resulted in renewed interest in related compounds and a search for materials that may replicate the defect-tolerant properties and long lifetimes of the hybrid lead-halide perovskites. Given the rapid pace of development of the field, the rises in efficiencies of these systems have outpaced the more basic understanding of these materials. Measuring or calculating the basic properties, such as crystal/electronic structure and composition, can be challenging because some of these materials have anisotropic structures, and/or are composed of both heavy metal cations and volatile, mobile, light elements. Some consequences are beam damage during characterization, composition change under vacuum, or compound effects, such as the alteration of the electronic structure through the influence of the substrate. These effects make it challenging to understand the basic properties integral to optoelectronic operation. Compounding these difficulties is the rapid pace with which the field progresses. This has created an ongoing need to continually evaluate best practices with respect to characterization and calculations, as well as to identify inconsistencies in reported values to determine if those inconsistencies are rooted in characterization methodology or materials synthesis. This article describes the difficulties in characterizing hybrid lead-halide perovskites and new materials and how these challenges may be overcome. The topic was discussed at a seminar at the 2015 Materials Research Society Fall Meeting & Exhibit. This article highlights the lessons learned from the seminar and the insights of some of the attendees, with reference to both recent literature and controlled experiments to illustrate the challenges discussed. The focus in this article is on crystallography, composition measurements, photoemission spectroscopy, and calculations on perovskites and new, related absorbers. We suggest how the reporting of the important artifacts could be streamlined between groups to ensure reproducibility as the field progresses.","American Chemical Society (ACS)","","SLAC National Accelerator Lab., Menlo Park, CA (United States); Energy Frontier Research Centers (EFRC) (United States).

In order to quantify the effects of cation disorder on CZTSe device performance, completed devices were annealed under open-circuit conditions at various temperatures from 110 degrees C to 215 degrees C and subsequently quenched. Measurements on these devices document systematic, reversible changes in solar-cell performance consistent with a reduction in CZTSe band tails at lower annealing temperatures. CIGS and CZTSe solar cells were also annealed at various temperatures (200 degrees C for CIGS and 110 degrees C-215 degrees C for CZTSe) and subsequently quenched with continuously applied voltage bias to explore the effects of non-equilibrium annealing conditions. For both absorbers, large reversible changes in device characteristics correlated with the magnitude and sign of the applied voltage bias were observed. For CZTSe devices, the voltage-bias annealing (VBA) produced reversible changes in open-circuit voltage (VOC) from 289 meV to 446 meV. For CIGS solar cells, even larger changes were observed in device performance: photovoltaic (PV) conversion efficiency of the CIGS device varied from below 3% to above 15%, with corresponding changes in CIGS hole density of about three orders of magnitude. Findings from these VBA experiments are interpreted in terms of changes to the metastable point-defect populations that control key properties in the absorber layers, and in the CdS buffer layer. Computational device modeling was performed to assess the impacts of cation disorder on the CZTSe VOC deficit, and to elucidate the effects of VBA treatments on metastable point defect populations in CZTSe, CIGS, and CdS. Our results indicate that band tails impose important limitations on CZTSe device performance. Device modeling results also indicate that non-equilibrium processing conditions including the effects of voltage bias can dramatically alter point-defect-mediated opto-electronic properties of semiconductors. Implications for optimization of PV materials and connections to long-term stability of PV devices are discussed.","American Institute of Physics (AIP)","","National Renewable Energy Lab.

Future work is prioritized based upon information assembled from recent installations, and inconsistencies in degradation mode identification are discussed to help guide future publication on this subject. Reported failure rates of photovoltaic modules fall mostly in the range of other consumer products; however, the long expected useful life of modules may not allow for direct comparison. In general, degradation percentages are reported to decrease appreciably in newer installations that are deployed after the year 2000. However, these trends may be convoluted with varying manufacturing and installation quality world-wide. Modules in hot and humid climates show considerably higher degradation modes than those in desert and moderate climates, which warrants further investigation. Delamination and diode/j-box issues are also more frequent in hot and humid climates than in other climates. The highest concerns of systems installed in the last 10 years appear to be hot spots followed by internal circuitry discoloration. Encapsulant discoloration was the most common degradation mode, particularly in older systems. In newer systems, encapsulant discoloration appears in hotter climates, but to a lesser degree. Lastly, thin-film degradation modes are dominated by glass breakage and absorber corrosion, although the breadth of information for thin-film modules is much smaller than for x-Si.","Wiley","","National Renewable Energy Lab.

For a newly constructed solar field at a geothermal power plant site, it is critical to properly characterize its performance so that the prediction of thermal power generation can be derived to develop an optimum operating strategy for a hybrid system. In the past, laboratory characterization of a solar collector has often extended into the solar field performance model and has been used to predict the actual solar field performance, disregarding realistic impacting factors. In this work, an extensive measurement on mirror slope error and receiver position error has been performed in the field by using the optical characterization tool called Distant Observer (DO). Combining a solar reflectance sampling procedure, a newly developed solar characterization program called FirstOPTIC and public software for annual performance modeling called System Advisor Model (SAM), a comprehensive solar field optical characterization has been conducted, thus allowing for an informed prediction of solar field annual performance. The paper illustrates this detailed solar field optical characterization procedure and demonstrates how the results help to quantify an appropriate tracking-correction strategy to improve solar field performance. In particular, it is found that an appropriate tracking-offset algorithm can improve the solar field performance by about 15%. The work here provides a valuable reference for the growing CSP industry.","ASME","","National Renewable Energy Lab.

Point defects are localized within the bulk crystal while extended defects occur at surfaces and grain boundaries. If not properly managed, surfaces can be a large source of carrier recombination. Separating surface carrier dynamics from bulk and/or grain-boundary recombination in thin films is challenging. Here, we employ transient reflection spectroscopy to measure the surface carrier dynamics in methylammonium lead iodide perovskite polycrystalline films. We find that surface recombination limits the total carrier lifetime in perovskite polycrystalline thin films, meaning that recombination inside grains and/or at grain boundaries is less important than top and bottom surface recombination. As a result, the surface recombination velocity in polycrystalline films is nearly an order of magnitude smaller than that in single crystals, possibly due to unintended surface passivation of the films during synthesis.","Nature Publishing Group","","National Renewable Energy Lab.
