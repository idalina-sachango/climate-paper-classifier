Sandwiched LCM GaInP showed robust optical properties due to periodic potential nature of the LCM structure, and the periodicity was undistorted even for thickness far beyond the critical layer thickness. A thick LCM GaInP structure with undistorted potential that could preserve the properties of native LCM structure was possible by stacking thin LCM GaInP structures interspaced with strain compensating GaInP layers. Furthermore, the sandwiched structure could be beneficial in realizing the LCM structure embedded high efficiency solar cells.","American Institute of Physics (AIP)","","National Renewable Energy Lab.

"Forecasting residential solar photovoltaic deployment in California","Dong, Changgui; Sigrin, Benjamin; Brinkman, Gregory","14 SOLAR ENERGY; 29 ENERGY PLANNING, POLICY, AND ECONOMY; solar PV; forecasting; diffusion models; policy impact; policies; California","Residential distributed photovoltaic (PV) deployment in the United States has experienced robust growth, and policy changes impacting the value of solar are likely to occur at the federal and state levels. To establish a credible baseline and evaluate impacts of potential new policies, this analysis employs multiple methods to forecast residential PV deployment in California, including a time-series forecasting model, a threshold heterogeneity diffusion model, a Bass diffusion model, and National Renewable Energy Laboratory's dSolar model. As a baseline, the residential PV market in California is modeled to peak in the early 2020s, with a peak annual installation of 1.5-2 GW across models. We then use the baseline results from the dSolar model and the threshold model to gauge the impact of the recent federal investment tax credit (ITC) extension, the newly approved California net energy metering (NEM) policy, and a hypothetical value-of-solar (VOS) compensation scheme. We find that the recent ITC extension may increase annual PV installations by 12%-18% (roughly 500 MW, MW) for the California residential sector in 2019-2020. The new NEM policy only has a negligible effect in California due to the relatively small new charges (< 100 MW in 2019-2020). Moreover, impacts of the VOS compensation scheme (0.12 cents per kilowatt-hour) are larger, reducing annual PV adoption by 32% (or 900-1300 MW) in 2019-2020.","Elsevier","","National Renewable Energy Lab.

Here, complementary techniques are used to expose the window layer (CdS or CdS:O) in completed superstrate devices and combined with a suite of materials characterization to elucidate its evolution during high temperature device processing. During device fabrication amorphous CdS:O undergoes significant interdiffusion with CdTe and recrystallization, forming CdS1-yTey nanocrystals whose Te fraction approaches solubility limits. Significant oxygen remains after processing, concentrated in sulfate clusters dispersed among the CdS1-yTey alloy phase, accounting for ~30% of the post-processed window layer based on cross-sectional microscopy. Interdiffusion and recrystallization are observed in devices with un-oxygenated CdS, but to a much lesser extent. Etching experiments suggest that the CdS thickness is minimally changed during processing, but the CdS:O window layer is reduced from 100 nm to 60-80 nm, which is confirmed by microscopy. Alloying reduces the band gap of the CdS:O window layer to 2.15 eV, but reductions in thickness and areal density improve its transmission spectrum, which is well matched to device quantum efficiency. The changes to the window layer in the reactive environments of device fabrication are profoundly different than what occurs by thermal annealing in an inert environment, which produced films with a band gap of 2.4 eV for both CdS and CdS:O. These results illustrate for the first time the significant changes that occur to the window layer during processing that are critical to the performance of CdTe solar cells.","Elsevier","","National Renewable Energy Lab.

"Critical role of the sorting polymer in carbon nanotube-based minority carrier devices","Mallajosyula, Arun T.; Nie, Wanyi; Gupta, Gautam; Blackburn, Jeffrey L.; Doorn, Stephen K.; Mohite, Aditya D.","14 SOLAR ENERGY; 77 NANOSCIENCE AND NANOTECHNOLOGY; carbon nanotubes layer; single chirality; polymer wrapping; polyfluorenes; solar cell","A prerequisite for carbon nanotube-based optoelectronic devices is the ability to sort them into a pure semiconductor phase. One of the most common sorting routes is enabled through using specific wrapping polymers. Here we show that subtle changes in the polymer structure can have a dramatic influence on the figures of merit of a carbon nanotube-based photovoltaic device. By comparing two commonly used polyfluorenes (PFO and PFO-BPy) for wrapping (7,5) and (6,5) chirality SWCNTs, we demonstrate that they have contrasting effects on the device efficiency. We attribute this to the differences in their ability to efficiently transfer charge. Although PFO may act as an efficient interfacial layer at the anode, PFO-BPy, having the additional pyridine side groups, forms a high resistance layer degrading the device efficiency. By comparing PFO|C<sub>60</sub> and C<sub>60</sub>-only devices, we found that presence of a PFO layer at low optical densities resulted in the increase of all three solar cell parameters, giving nearly an order of magnitude higher efficiency over that of C<sub>60</sub>-only devices. In addition, with a relatively higher contribution to photocurrent from the PFO-C<sub>60</sub> interface, an open circuit voltage of 0.55 V was obtained for PFO-(7,5)-C<sub>60</sub> devices. On the other hand, PFO-BPy does not affect the open circuit voltage but drastically reduces the short circuit current density. Lastly, these results indicate that the charge transport properties and energy levels of the sorting polymers have to be taken into account to fully understand their effect on carbon nanotube-based solar cells.","American Chemical Society (ACS)","","National Renewable Energy Lab.

Both crystalline silicon (c-Si) and thin-film PV modules are susceptible to PID. While extensive studies have already been conducted in this area, the understanding of the PID phenomena is still incomplete and it remains a major problem in the PV industry. Herein, a critical review of the available literature is given to serve as a one-stop source for understanding the current status of PID research. This article also aims to provide an overview of future research paths to address PID-related issues. This paper consists of three parts. In the first part, the modelling of leakage current paths in the module package is discussed. The PID mechanisms in both c-Si and thin-film PV modules are also comprehensively reviewed. The second part summarizes various test methods to evaluate PV modules for PID. The last part focuses on studies related to PID in the omnipresent p-type c-Si PV modules. The dependence of temperature, humidity and voltage on the progression of PID is examined. Preventive measures against PID at the cell, module and system levels are illustrated. Moreover, PID recovery in standard p-type c-Si PV modules is also studied. Most of the findings from p-type c-Si PV modules are also applicable to other PV module technologies.","Royal Society of Chemistry","","National Renewable Energy Lab.

The data on CdTe films treated by exposure to CdCl<sub>2</sub> vapor reveal that a critical function of the treatment is to reduce surface, interface and GB recombination throughout the entirety of these polycrystalline films.

The ordered structure is metastable in the bulk, so any glissile dislocation that disrupts the ordered pattern will release stored energy, and experience an increased glide force. Here we show how this connection between atomic ordering and dislocation glide force can be exploited to control the threading dislocation density (TDD) in Ga<sub>x</sub>In<sub>1-x</sub>P CGBs. When ordered Ga<sub>x</sub>In<sub>1-x</sub>P is graded from the GaAs lattice constant to InP, the order parameter ..eta.. decreases as x decreases, and dislocation glide switches from one set of glide planes to the other. This glide plane switch (GPS) is accompanied by the nucleation of dislocations on the new glide plane, which typically leads to increased TDD. We develop control of the GPS position within a Ga<sub>x</sub>In<sub>1-x</sub>P CGB through manipulation of deposition temperature, surfactant concentration, and strain-grading rate. We demonstrate a two-stage Ga<sub>x</sub>In<sub>1-x</sub>P CGB from GaAs to InP with sufficiently low TDD for high performance devices, such as the 4-junction inverted metamorphic multi-junction solar cell, achieved through careful control the GPS position.

In this review, we describe our work investigating defects in tetrahedrally bonded, multinary semiconductors, and discuss the place of our research within the context of publications by other groups. We applied experimental and theory techniques to understand point defects, structural disorder, and extended antisite defects in one semiconductor of interest for photovoltaic applications, Cu<sub>2</sub>SnS<sub>3</sub>. We contrast our findings on Cu<sub>2</sub>SnS<sub>3</sub> with other chemically related Cu-Sn-S compounds, as well as structurally related compounds such as Cu<sub>2</sub>ZnSnS<sub>4</sub> and Cu(In,Ga)Se<sub>2</sub>. We find that evaluation of point defects alone is not sufficient to understand defect behavior in multinary tetrahedrally bonded semiconductors. In the case of Cu<sub>2</sub>SnS<sub>3</sub> and Cu<sub>2</sub>ZnSnS<sub>4</sub>, structural disorder and entropy-driven cation clustering can result in nanoscale compositional inhomogeneities which detrimentally impact the electronic transport. Therefore, it is not sufficient to assess only the point defect behavior of new multinary tetrahedrally bonded compounds; effects such as structural disorder and extended antisite defects must also be considered. Altogether, this review provides a framework for evaluating tetrahedrally bonded semiconducting compounds with respect to their defect behavior for photovoltaic and other applications, and suggests new materials that may not be as prone to such imperfections.","IOP Publishing","","National Renewable Energy Lab.

The worldwide capacity encompassed 135 GW in 2013 and is estimated to increase to 1721 GW in 2030 and 4674 GW in 2050, according to a prospective high-renewable scenario. To achieve this production level while minimizing environmental impacts, decision makers must have access to environmental performance data that reflect their high spatial variability accurately. We propose ENVI-PV (http://viewer.webservice-energy.org/project_iea), a new interactive tool that provides maps and screening level data, based on weighted average supply chains, for the environmental performance of common PV technologies. Environmental impacts of PV systems are evaluated according to a life cycle assessment approach. ENVI-PV was developed using a state-of-the-art interoperable and open standard Web Service framework from the Open Geospatial Consortium (OGC). It combines the latest life cycle inventories, published in 2015 by the International Energy Agency (IEA) under the Photovoltaic Power Systems Program (PVPS) Task 12, and some inventories previously published from Ecoinvent v2.2 database with solar irradiation estimates computed from the worldwide NASA SSE database. ENVI-PV is the first tool to propose a worldwide coverage of environmental performance of PV systems using a multi-criteria assessment. The user can compare the PV environmental performance to the environmental footprint of country electricity mixes. ENVI-PV is designed as an environmental interactive tool to generate PV technological options and evaluate their performance in different spatial and techno-economic contexts. Its potential applications are illustrated in this paper with several examples.","","","National Renewable Energy Lab.

Devices made with no diffusion barrier and KF coevaporation treatment exhibited the highest photovoltaic conversion efficiency with the smallest overall distribution in key current density-voltage (J-V) performance metrics. Out-diffusion of Na and K from the substrate, KF coevaporation, and KF PDT all increased carrier concentration, open-circuit voltage, fill factor, and power conversion efficiency. Quantum-efficiency analysis of devices highlighted the greatest loss in the short-circuit current density due to incomplete absorption and collection. Secondary ion mass spectrometry illustrated the efficacy of the SiO<sub>2</sub> film as a sodium and potassium diffusion barrier, as well as their relative concentration in the absorber.

Measurements of the dependence of photoluminescence intensity on excitation intensity were carried out, as well as measurements of time-resolved photoluminescence decay after an excitation pulse. It was found that decay times under very low photon injection conditions are dominated by a non-radiative Shockley-Read-Hall process described using a recombination center with an asymmetric capture cross section, where the cross section for holes is larger than that for electrons. As a result of the asymmetry, the center effectively extends photoluminescence decay by a hole trapping phenomenon. A reduction in electron capture cross section appeared at doping densities over 10<sup>16</sup>cm<sup>-3</sup>. An analysis of the excitation intensity dependence of room temperature photoluminescence revealed a strong relationship with doping concentration. Here, this allows estimates of the carrier concentration to be made through a non-destructive optical method.

We propose a strategy to obtain stable and commercially viable perovskite solar cells. A reproducible manufacturing method is suggested, as well as routes to manage grain boundaries and interfacial charge transport. Electroluminescence is regarded as a metric to gauge theoretical efficiency. We highlight how optimizing the design of device architectures is important not only for achieving high efficiency but also for hysteresis-free and stable performance.

This method produces interconnect widths of about 300 µm, and the area comprised by interconnects within a module (generally about 3%) does not contribute to power generation. The present work reports on an increasingly popular strategy capable of reducing the interconnect width to less than 100 µm: printing interconnects. Cost modeling projects a savings of about $0.02/watt for CdTe module production through the use of printed interconnects, with savings coming from both reduced capital expense and increased module power output.

The root-mean-square (RMS) roughness is reduced from 33.6 nm for 750 degrees C to 1.62 nm for 650 degrees C, determined by atomic force microscopy. Our initial investigations show that the RMS roughness can be further reduced using increased miscut angle, and substrates miscut toward (111)A, leading to an RMS roughness of 0.56 nm for the sample grown at 600 degrees C on GaAs miscut 6 degrees toward (111)A. Using these conditions, we fabricate an inverted hetero-junction 1.62 eV Ga<sub>0.68</sub>In<sub>0.32</sub>As<sub>0.35</sub>P<sub>0.65</sub> solar cell without an anti-reflection coating with a short-circuit current density, open-circuit voltage, fill factor, and efficiency of 12.23 mA/cm2, 1.12 V, 86.18%, and 11.80%, respectively.","Elsevier","","National Renewable Energy Lab.

In this work, we simultaneously monitor the structural phase transition of the active layer along with solar cell performance as a function of the device operating temperature. The tetragonal to cubic phase transition is observed in the working device to occur reversibly at temperatures between 60.5 and 65.4 degrees C. In these operando measurements, no discontinuity in the device performance is observed, indicating electronic behavior that is insensitive to the structural phase transition. Here, this decoupling of device performance from the change in long-range order across the phase transition suggests that the optoelectronic properties are primarily determined by the local structure in CH<sub>3</sub>NH<sub>3</sub>PbI<sub>3</sub>. That is, while the average crystal structure as probed by X-ray diffraction shows a transition from tetragonal to cubic, the local structure generally remains well characterized by uncorrelated, dynamic octahedral rotations that order at elevated temperatures but are unchanged locally.","American Chemical Society (ACS)","","National Renewable Energy Lab.

Often a reduced Langevin model is used to describe the decay behavior of electrons and holes. Here we propose a novel, simple kinetic model that accurately describes the decay behavior of free carriers in the PTB7:PCBM organic photovoltaic blend. In order to accurately describe the recombination behavior of free carriers as measured by time-resolved microwave conductivity (TRMC), this model needs to only take into account free and trapped holes in the polymer, and free electrons in the fullerene. The model is consistent for different PTB7:PCBM blend ratios and spans a light intensity range of over 3 orders of magnitude. Furthermore, the model demonstrates that dark carriers exist in the polymer and interact with photoinduced charge carriers, and that the trapping and detrapping rates of the holes are of high importance to the overall carrier lifetime.","American Chemical Society","","National Renewable Energy Lab.

Here, we synthesized new metastable isovalent (Sn,Zn)O alloy thin films by combinatorial reactive co-sputtering and characterized their structural, optical and electrical properties. The alloying of ZnO into SnO leads to a change of the valence state of the tin from Sn<sup>0</sup> via Sn<sup>2+</sup> to Sn<sup>4+</sup>, which can be counteracted by reducing the oxygen partial pressure during the deposition. The optical characterization of the smooth <10 at. % Sn<sub>1-x</sub>Zn<sub>x</sub>O thin films showed an increase in the absorption coefficient in the range from 1 to 2 eV, which is consistent with the theoretical predictions for the isovalent alloying.

"Encapsulation and backsheet adhesion metrology for photovoltaic modules","Tracy, Jared; Bosco, Nick; Novoa, Fernando; Dauskardt, Reinhold","14 SOLAR ENERGY; 36 MATERIALS SCIENCE; adhesion; reliability; delamination; photovoltaic; encapsulation; backsheet","Photovoltaic modules are designed to operate for decades in terrestrial environments. However, mechanical stress, moisture, and ultraviolet radiation eventually degrade protective materials in modules, particularly their adhesion properties, eventually leading to reduced solar cell performance. Despite the significance of interfacial adhesion to module durability, currently there is no reliable technique for characterizing module adhesion properties. We present a simple and reproducible metrology for characterizing adhesion in photovoltaic modules that is grounded in fundamental concepts of beam and fracture mechanics. Using width-tapered cantilever beam fracture specimens, interfacial adhesion was evaluated on relevant interfaces of encapsulation and backsheet structures of new and 27-year-old historic modules. The adhesion energy, Gc [J/m<sup>2</sup>], was calculated from the critical value of the strain energy release rate, G, using G = <i>βP<sup>2</sup></i>, where β (a mechanical and geometric parameter of the fracture specimen) and <i>P</i> (the experimentally measured critical load) are constants. Under some circumstances where testing may result in cracking of brittle layers in the test specimen, measurement of the delamination length in addition to the critical load was necessary to determine G. Relative to new module materials, backsheet adhesion was 95% and 98% lower for historic modules that were exposed (operated in the field) and unexposed (stored on-site, but out of direct sunlight), respectively. Encapsulation adhesion was 87-94% lower in the exposed modules and 31% lower in the unexposed module. As a result, the metrology presented here can be used to improve module materials and assess long-term reliability.","Wiley","","National Renewable Energy Lab.

In perovskite solar cells (PSC), these films result in efficiencies >17%. The grain boundaries (GBs) show high resistance at the top surface of the film, and act as an impediment to photocurrent collection. However, lower resistance pathways between grains exist below the top surface of the film, indicating that there exists a depth-dependent resistance of GBs (R<sub>GB</sub>(z)). Furthermore, lateral conductivity measurements indicate that R<sub>GB</sub>(z) exhibits GB-to-GB heterogeneity. These results indicate that increased photocurrent collection along GBs is not a prerequisite for high-efficiency PSCs. Rather, better control of depth-dependent GB electrical properties, and an improvement in the homogeneity of the GB-to-GB electrical properties, must be managed to enable further improvements in PSC efficiency.

Some of these methods calibrate radiometers indoors and some outdoors. To establish or understand the differences in calibration methodologies, we processed and analyzed field-measured data from radiometers deployed for 10 months at NREL's Solar Radiation Research Laboratory. These different methods of calibration resulted in a difference of ±1% to ±2% in solar irradiance measurements. Here by analyzing these differences will ultimately assist in determining the uncertainties of the field radiometer data and will help develop a consensus on a standard for calibration. Further advancing procedures for precisely calibrating radiometers to world reference standards that reduce measurement uncertainties will help the accurate prediction of the output of planned solar conversion projects and improve the bankability of financing solar projects.","Wiley","","National Renewable Energy Lab.

"Nano-XRF Analysis of Metal Impurities Distribution at PL Active Grain Boundaries During mc-Silicon Solar Cell Processing","Bernardini, Simone; Johnston, Steve; West, Bradley; Naerland, Tine U.; Stuckelberger, Michael; Lai, Barry; Bertoni, Mariana I.","14 SOLAR ENERGY; 36 MATERIALS SCIENCE; multicrystalline silicon (mc-Si); photoluminescence (PL); PL band reversal sub-band PL; X-ray fluorescence","Metal impurities are known to hinder the performance of commercial Si-based solar cells by inducing bulk recombination, increasing leakage current, and causing direct shunting. Recently, a set of photoluminescence (PL) images of neighboring multicrystalline silicon wafers taken from a cell production line at different processing stages has been acquired. Both band-to-band PL and sub-bandgap PL (subPL) images showed various regions with different PL signal intensity. Interestingly, in several of these regions a reversal of the subPL intensity was observed right after the deposition of the antireflective coating. In this paper, we present the results of the synchrotron-based nano-X-ray fluorescence imaging performed in areas characterized by the subPL reversal to evaluate the possible role of metal decoration in this uncommon behavior. Furthermore, the acquisition of a statistically meaningful set of data for samples taken at different stages of the solar cell manufacturing allows us to shine a light on the precipitation and rediffusion mechanisms of metal impurities at these grain boundaries.","IEEE","","National Renewable Energy Lab.

By performing spatially resolved Raman and photoluminescence spectroscopy with varying excitation wavelength, density, and data acquisition parameters, we achieve a unified understanding towards the spectroscopy signatures of the organic-inorganic hybrid perovskite, transforming from the pristine state (CH 3 NH 3 PbI 3 ) to the fully degraded state (i.e., PbI 2 ) for samples with varying crystalline domain size from mesoscopic scale (approximately 100 nm) to macroscopic size (centimeters), synthesized by three different techniques. We show that the hybrid perovskite exhibits multiple stages of structure transformation occurring either spontaneously or under light illumination, with exceptionally high sensitivity to the illumination conditions (e.g., power, illumination time, and interruption pattern). We highlight four transformation stages (stages I-IV, with stage I being the pristine state) along either the spontaneous or photoinduced degradation path exhibiting distinctly different Raman spectroscopy features at each stage, and point out that previously reported Raman spectra in the literature reflect highly degraded structures of either stage III or stage IV. Additional characteristic optical features of partially degraded materials under the joint action of spontaneous and photodegradation are also given. This study offers reliable benchmark results for understanding the intrinsic material properties and structure transformation of this unique category of hybrid materials, and the findings are pertinently important to a wide range of potential applications where the hybrid material is expected to function in greatly different environment and light-matter interaction conditions.","American Physical Society","","National Renewable Energy Lab.

We find that the through-thickness CL total intensity profiles are consistent with a reduction in grain-boundary recombination due to the CdCl<sub>2</sub> treatment. The color-coded CL maps of the near-band-edge transitions indicate significant variations in the defect recombination activity at the micron and sub-micron scales within grains, from grain to grain, throughout the film depth, and between films with different processing histories. We estimated the grain-interior sulfur-alloying fraction in the interdiffused CdTe/CdS region of the CdCl<sub>2</sub>-treated films from a sample of 35 grains and found that it is not strongly correlated with CL intensity. A kinetic rate-equation model was used to simulate grain-boundary (GB) and grain-interior CL spectra. Simulations indicate that the large reduction in the exciton band intensity and relatively small decrease in the lower-energy band intensity at CdTe GBs or dislocations can be explained by an enhanced electron-hole non-radiative recombination rate at the deep GB or dislocation defects. Additionally, simulations also show that higher GB concentrations of donors and/or acceptors can increase the lower-energy band intensity, while slightly decreasing the exciton band intensity.","American Institute of Physics (AIP)","","National Renewable Energy Lab.

The energy shift persists only during the pulse duration with an instantaneous response time. The optical Stark effect has practical relevance for applications, including quantum information processing and communication, and passively mode-locked femtosecond lasers. Here we demonstrate that solution-processable lead-halide perovskites exhibit a large optical Stark effect that is easily resolved at room temperature resulting from the sharp excitonic feature near the bandedge. We also demonstrate that a polarized pump pulse selectively shifts one spin state producing a spin splitting of the degenerate excitonic states. Such selective spin manipulation is an important prerequisite for spintronic applications. Lastly, our result implies that such hybrid semiconductors may have great potential for optoelectronic applications beyond photovoltaics.","Nature Publishing Group","","National Renewable Energy Lab.

The devices had differing substrates, absorber deposition processes, buffer materials, and contact materials. The effective bandgaps of devices varied from 1.05 to 1.22 eV, with the lowest optical bandgaps occurring in those with metal-precursor absorber processes. Devices with Zn(O, S) or thin CdS buffers had quantum efficiencies above 90% down to 400 nm. Most voltages were 250-300 mV below the Shockley-Queisser limit for their bandgap. Electroluminescence intensity tracked well with the respective voltage deficits. Fill factor (FF) was as high as 95% of the maximum for each device's respective current and voltage, with higher FF corresponding to lower diode quality factors (~1.3). An in-depth analysis of FF losses determined that diode quality reflected in the quality factor, voltage-dependent photocurrent, and, to a lesser extent, the parasitic resistances are the limiting factors. As a result, different absorber processes and device structures led to a range of electrical and physical characteristics, yet this investigation showed that multiple fabrication pathways could lead to high-quality and high-efficiency solar cells.","IEEE","","National Renewable Energy Lab.

At present, the cost of III-V cells is far too high for this approach to be competitive for one-sun terrestrial power applications. We investigated the system-level economic benefits of both GaAs/Si and InGaP/Si tandem modules in favorable future scenarios where the cost of III-V cells is substantially reduced, perhaps to less than the cost of Si cells. We found, somewhat unexpectedly, that these tandems can reduce installed system cost only when the area-related balance-of-system cost is high, such as for area-constrained residential rooftop systems in the USA. When area-related balance-of-system cost is lower, such as for utility-scale systems, the tandem module offers no benefit. This is because a system using tandem modules is more expensive than one using single-junction Si modules when III-V cells are expensive, and a system using tandem modules is more expensive than one using single-junction III-V modules when III-V cells are inexpensive.","Wiley","","National Renewable Energy Lab.

CdS buffer development has shown optimal interface properties, whereas Zn(O,S) buffer development has shown increased photocurrent. Although a totally Cd-free solar module is more marketable, the retention of a small amount of Cd can be beneficial to achieve optimum junction properties. As long as the amount of Cd is reduced to less than 0.01% by weight, the presence of Cd does not violate the hazardous substance restrictions of the European Union (EU). We estimate the amount of Cd allowed in the EU for CIGS on both glass and stainless steel substrates, and we show that reducing Cd becomes increasingly important as substrate weights decrease. As a result, this hybrid buffer layer had reduced Cd content and a wider space charge region, while achieving equal or better solar cell performance than buffer layers of either CdS or Zn(O,S) alone.","IEEE","","National Renewable Energy Lab.

"PV Degradation Curves: Non-Linearities and Failure Modes","Jordan, Dirk C.; Silverman, Timothy J.; Sekulic, Bill; Kurtz, Sarah R.","14 SOLAR ENERGY; 47 OTHER INSTRUMENTATION; PV degradation; durability; reliability; failure mode; non-linearity","Photovoltaic (PV) reliability and durability have seen increased interest in recent years. Historically, and as a preliminarily reasonable approximation, linear degradation rates have been used to quantify long-term module and system performance. The underlying assumption of linearity can be violated at the beginning of the life, as has been well documented, especially for thin-film technology. Additionally, non-linearities in the wear-out phase can have significant economic impact and appear to be linked to different failure modes. In addition, associating specific degradation and failure modes with specific time series behavior will aid in duplicating these degradation modes in accelerated tests and, eventually, in service life prediction. In this paper, we discuss different degradation modes and how some of these may cause approximately linear degradation within the measurement uncertainty (e.g., modules that were mainly affected by encapsulant discoloration) while other degradation modes lead to distinctly non-linear degradation (e.g., hot spots caused by cracked cells or solder bond failures and corrosion). The various behaviors are summarized with the goal of aiding in predictions of what may be seen in other systems.","","","National Renewable Energy Lab.

Here, we report that SnO<sub>2</sub> and fullerenes can work cooperatively to further boost the performance of perovskite solar cells. We find that fullerenes can be redissolved during perovskite deposition, allowing ultra-thin fullerenes to be retained at the interface and some dissolved fullerenes infiltrate into perovskite grain boundaries. The SnO<sub>2</sub> layer blocks holes effectively; whereas, the fullerenes promote electron transfer and passivate both the SnO<sub>2</sub>/perovskite interface and perovskite grain boundaries. With careful device optimization, the best-performing planar perovskite solar cell using a fullerene passivated SnO<sub>2</sub> ESL has achieved a steady-state efficiency of 17.75% and a power conversion efficiency of 19.12% with an open circuit voltage of 1.12 V, a short-circuit current density of 22.61 mA cm<sup>-2</sup>, and a fill factor of 75.8% when measured under reverse voltage scanning. In conclusion, we find that the partial dissolving of fullerenes during perovskite deposition is the key for fabricating high-performance perovskite solar cells based on metal oxide/fullerene ESLs.","Royal Society of Chemistry","","National Renewable Energy Lab.

In this work, we show continued improvement of the performance of HVPE-grown single-junction GaAs solar cells. We show over an order of magnitude improvement in the interface recombination velocity between GaAs and GaInP layers through the elimination of growth interrupts, leading to increased short-circuit current density and open-circuit voltage compared with cells with interrupts. One-sun conversion efficiencies as high as 20.6% were achieved with this improved growth process. Solar cells grown in an inverted configuration that were removed from the substrate showed nearly identical performance to on-wafer cells, demonstrating the viability of HVPE to be used together with conventional wafer reuse techniques for further cost reduction. As a result, these devices utilized multiple heterointerfaces, showing the potential of HVPE for the growth of complex and high-quality III-V devices.","IEEE","","National Renewable Energy Lab.

We explore the role of the potassium fluoride (KF) post-deposition treatment in CIGS by employing energy- and time-resolved photoluminescence spectroscopy and electrical characterization combined with numerical modeling. The bulk carrier lifetime is found to increase with post-deposition treatment from 255 ns to 388 ns, which is the longest charge carrier lifetime reported for CIGS, and within ~40% of the radiative limit. We find evidence that the post-deposition treatment causes a decrease in the electronic potential fluctuations. These potential fluctuations have previously been shown to reduce the open-circuit voltage and the device efficiency in CIGS. Additionally, numerical simulations based on the measured carrier lifetimes and mobilities show a diffusion length of ~10 um, which is ~4 times larger than the film thickness. Furthermore, carrier collection in the bulk is not a limiting factor for device efficiency. By considering differences in doping, bandgap, and potential fluctuations, we present a possible explanation for the voltage difference between KF-treated and untreated samples.","American Institute of Physics (AIP)","","National Renewable Energy Lab.

Many early-stage devices are prone to device shunting due to pinholes in the absorber layer, producing “false-negative” results. We demonstrate a device engineering solution toward a robust device architecture, using a two-step absorber deposition approach. We use tin sulfide (SnS) as a test absorber material. The SnS bulk is processed at high temperature (400 °C) to stimulate grain growth, followed by a much thinner, low-temperature (200 °C) absorber deposition. At a lower process temperature, the thin absorber overlayer contains significantly smaller, densely packed grains, which are likely to provide a continuous coating and fill pinholes in the underlying absorber bulk. We compare this two-step approach to the more standard approach of using a semi-insulating buffer layer directly on top of the annealed absorber bulk, and we demonstrate a more than 3.5× superior shunt resistance R<sub>sh</sub> with smaller standard error σ<sub>Rsh</sub>. Electron-beam-induced current (EBIC) measurements indicate a lower density of pinholes in the SnS absorber bulk when using the two-step absorber deposition approach. We correlate those findings to improvements in the device performance and device performance reproducibility.","American Chemical Society (ACS)","","National Renewable Energy Lab.

A higher MABr concentration enhances I-Br anion exchange reaction, yielding poorer device performance.

The trends in the photoconversion efficiency and in the spectral response of the PV devices as a function of thickness of CdS contacts were explained with the help of optical and morphological characterization of the CdS thin films. The maximum PV efficiency achieved for the combinatorial dip-coating CBD was similar to that for the PV devices processed using conventional CBD. Finally, the results of this study lead to the conclusion that combinatorial dip-coating can be used to accelerate the optimization of PV device performance of CdS and other candidate contact layers for a wide range of emerging absorbers.","American Chemical Society (ACS)","","National Renewable Energy Lab.

The SCS shows distinct p-type, transitional, and n-type spectra across the devices, and the spectral features change rapidly with location in the depletion region, which results in determining the EJ with ~20-nm resolution. We found an n-type CIGS in the region next to the CIGS/CdS interface; thus, the cell is a homojunction. The EJ is ~40 nm from the interface on the CIGS side. In contrast, such an n-type CZTS was not found in the CZTS/CdS cells. The EJ is ~20 nm from the CZTS/CdS interface, which is consistent with asymmetrical carrier concentrations of the p-CZTS and n-CdS in a heterojunction cell.

Specifically, we model, from 2015 to 2050, solar power-induced reductions to greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions, air pollutant emissions, and water usage. To find the incremental benefits of new solar deployment, we compare the difference between two scenarios, one where solar costs have fallen such that solar supplies 14% of the nation's electricity by 2030 and 27% by 2050, and a baseline scenario in which no solar is added after 2014. We monetize benefits, where credible methods exist to do so. We find that under these scenarios, solar power reduces GHG and air pollutants by ~10%, from 2015 to 2050, providing a discounted present value of $56-$789 billion (central value of ~$250 billion, equivalent to ~2 cents/kWh-solar) in climate benefits and $77-$298 billion (central value of $167 billion, or ~1.4 cents/kWh-solar) in air quality and public health benefits. The ranges reflect uncertainty within the literature about the marginal impact of emissions of GHG and air pollutants. Solar power is also found to reduce water withdrawals and consumption by 4% and 9%, respectively, including in many drought-prone states.","Elsevier","","Lawrence Berkeley National Lab.

Herein, by applying controllable hydrostatic pressure, we have achieved unprecedented simultaneous enhancement in both band-gap narrowing and carrier-lifetime prolongation (up to 70% to -100% increase) under mild pressures at -0.3 GPa. The pressure-induced modulation on pure hybrid perovskites without introducing any adverse chemical or thermal effect clearly demonstrates the importance of band edges on the photon-electron interaction and maps a pioneering route toward a further increase in their photovoltaic performance.","National Academy of Sciences, Washington, DC (United States)","","National Renewable Energy Lab.

It is challenging for innovative techniques to displace conventional growth methods due the low dislocation density and high lifetime required for high efficiency devices. One promising innovation in crystal growth is the noncontact crucible method (NOC-Si), which combines aspects of Czochralski (Cz) and conventional casting. This material has the potential to satisfy the dual requirements, with capex likely between that of Cz (high capex) and multicrystalline silicon (mc-Si, low capex). In this contribution, we observe a strong dependence of solar cell efficiency on ingot height, correlated with the evolution of swirl-like defects, for single crystalline <i>n</i>-type silicon grown by the NOC-Si method. We posit that these defects are similar to those observed in Cz, and we explore the response of NOC-Si to high temperature treatments including phosphorous diffusion gettering (PDG) and Tabula Rasa (TR). The highest lifetimes (2033 us for the top of the ingot and 342 us for the bottom of the ingot) are achieved for TR followed by a PDG process comprising a standard plateau and a low temperature anneal. Further improvements can be gained by tailoring the time-temperature profiles of each process. Lifetime analysis after the PDG process indicates the presence of a getterable impurity in the as-grown material, while analysis after TR points to the presence of oxide precipitates especially at the bottom of the ingot. Uniform lifetime degradation is observed after TR which we assign to a presently unknown defect. Lastly, future work includes additional TR processing to uncover the nature of this defect, microstructural characterization of suspected oxide precipitates, and optimization of the TR process to achieve the dual goals of high lifetime and spatial homogenization.","Elsevier","","National Renewable Energy Lab.

In the photoreaction, after fast electron transfer, holes that remain in the nanostructure play an important role in the total quantum yield of hydrogen production. Unfortunately, knowledge of hole dynamics is limited due to lack of convenient spectroscopic signatures. Here, we directly probe hole localization dynamics within CdSe nanorods (NRs) by combining transient absorption (TA) and time-resolved terahertz (TRTS) spectroscopy. We show that when methylene blue is used as an electron acceptor, the resulting electron transfer occurs with a time constant of 3.5 +/- 0.1 ps and leaves behind a delocalized hole. However, the hole quickly localizes in the Coulomb potential well generated by the reduced electron acceptor near the NR surface with time constant of 11.7 +/- 0.2 ps. Our theoretical investigation suggests that the hole becomes confined to a ~ +/-0.8 nm region near the reduced electron acceptor and the activation energy to detrap the hole from the potential well can be as large as 235 meV.","","","National Renewable Energy Lab.

To elucidate the structure-property relationships of these materials, we have synthesized the solid solution Cs<sub>2</sub>Sn<sub>1-x</sub>Te<sub>x</sub>I<sub>6</sub>. However, even though tellurium substitution increases electronic dispersion via closer I-I contact distances, the substitution experimentally yields insulating behavior from a significant decrease in carrier concentration and mobility. Density functional calculations of native defects in Cs<sub>2</sub>SnI<sub>6</sub> reveal that iodine vacancies exhibit a low enthalpy of formation and the defect energy level is a shallow donor to the conduction band, rendering the material tolerant to these defect states. The increased covalency of Te-I bonding renders the formation of iodine vacancy states unfavorable, and is responsible for the reduction in conductivity upon Te substitution. Additionally, Cs<sub>2</sub>TeI<sub>6</sub> is intolerant to the formation of these defects, as the defect level occurs deep within the band gap and thus localizes potential mobile charge carriers. In these vacancy-ordered double perovskites, the close-packed lattice of iodine provides significant electronic dispersion, while the interaction of the B- and X-site ions dictates the properties as they pertain to electronic structure and defect tolerance. This simplified perspective based on extensive experimental and theoretical analysis provides a platform from which to understand structure-property relationships in functional perovskite halides.","American Chemical Society (ACS)","","National Renewable Energy Lab.

In this paper, we examine the mechanisms underlying these results in Ga2O3:Sn thin films prepared at various growth temperatures, Sn concentrations, and oxygen partial pressures. With X-ray absorption spectroscopy, transmission electron microscopy and energy dispersive spectroscopy, we find that when films are grown under the oxygen deficient conditions there are Ga sub-oxide and SnOx phases in the Ga2O3:Sn thin film. These Ga sub-oxide phases are only found in non-transparent films, and so we infer that the Ga sub-oxide is responsible for the non-transparency.

"Suppression of compensating native defect formation during semiconductor processing via excess carriers","Alberi, Kirstin; Scarpulla, M. A.","14 SOLAR ENERGY; 71 CLASSICAL AND QUANTUM MECHANICS, GENERAL PHYSICS; semiconductors; defects; processing; electronic devices","In many semiconductors, compensating defects set doping limits, decrease carrier mobility, and reduce minority carrier lifetime thus limiting their utility in devices. Native defects are often responsible. Suppressing the concentrations of compensating defects during processing close to thermal equilibrium is difficult because formation enthalpies are lowered as the Fermi level moves towards the majority band edge. Excess carriers, introduced for example by photogeneration, modify the formation enthalpy of semiconductor defects and thus can be harnessed during crystal growth or annealing to suppress defect populations. Herein we develop a rigorous and general model for defect formation in the presence of steady-state excess carrier concentrations by combining the standard quasi-chemical formalism with a detailed-balance description that is applicable for any defect state in the bandgap. Considering the quasi-Fermi levels as chemical potentials, we demonstrate that increasing the minority carrier concentration increases the formation enthalpy for typical compensating centers, thus suppressing their formation. Furthermore, this effect is illustrated for the specific example of GaSb. While our treatment is generalized for excess carrier injection or generation in semiconductors by any means, we provide a set of guidelines for applying the concept in photoassisted physical vapor deposition.","Nature Publishing Group","","National Renewable Energy Lab.

Performance losses from acceptor-type interface defects can be significant when interface defect states are located near mid-gap energies. Numerical simulations show that the emitter/absorber band alignment, the emitter doping and thickness, and the defect properties of the interface (i.e., defect density, defect type, and defect energy) can all play significant roles in the interface recombination. In particular, a type I heterojunction with small conduction-band offset (0.1 eV ≤ ΔE<sub>C</sub> ≤ 0.3 eV) can help maintain good cell efficiency in spite of high interface defect density, much like with Cu(In,Ga)Se<sub>2</sub> (CIGS) cells. The basic principle is that positive ΔE<sub>C</sub>, often referred to as a “spike,” creates an absorber inversion and hence a large hole barrier adjacent to the interface. As a result, the electron-hole recombination is suppressed due to an insufficient hole supply at the interface. A large spike (ΔE<sub>C</sub> ≥ 0.4 eV), however, can impede electron transport and lead to a reduction of photocurrent and fill-factor. In contrast to the spike, a “cliff” (ΔE<sub>C</sub> < 0 eV) allows high hole concentration in the vicinity of the interface, which will assist interface recombination and result in a reduced open-circuit voltage. Another way to mitigate performance losses due to interface defects is to use a thin and highly doped emitter, which can invert the absorber and form a large hole barrier at the interface. CdS is the most common emitter material used in CdTe solar cells, but the CdS/CdTe interface is in the cliff category and is not favorable from the band-offset perspective. The ΔE<sub>C</sub> of other n-type emitter choices, such as (Mg,Zn)O, Cd(S,O), or (Cd,Mg)Te, can be tuned by varying the elemental ratio for an optimal positive value of ΔE<sub>C</sub>. As a result, these materials are predicted to yield higher voltages and would therefore be better candidates for the CdTe-cell emitter.","American Institute of Physics (AIP)","","National Renewable Energy Lab.

"Development of soft-sphere contact models for thermal heat conduction in granular flows","Morris, A. B.; Pannala, S.; Ma, Z.; Hrenya, C. M.","14 SOLAR ENERGY; 47 OTHER INSTRUMENTATION; heat conduction; discrete element method; soft-sphere contact models","Conductive heat transfer to flowing particles occurs when two particles (or a particle and wall) come into contact. The direct conduction between the two bodies depends on the collision dynamics, namely the size of the contact area and the duration of contact. For soft-sphere discrete-particle simulations, it is computationally expensive to resolve the true collision time because doing so would require a restrictively small numerical time step. To improve the computational speed, it is common to increase the 'softness' of the material to artificially increase the collision time, but doing so affects the heat transfer. In this work, two physically-based correction terms are derived to compensate for the increased contact area and time stemming from artificial particle softening.

We compare conventionally synthesized PbS from a PbO precursor to PbS synthesized using cation-exchange from CdS QDs. We show that strongly coupled films of PbS QDs from the cation-exchange luminesce with significant efficiency at room temperature. This is in stark contrast to conventional PbS QDs, which have exceedingly weak room temperature emission. Moreover, the power dependence of the emission is quadratic, indicating bimolecular radiative recombination that is reasonably competitive with trap-assisted recombination, a feature previously unreported in coupled PbS QD films. We interpret these results in terms of a greatly reduced defect concentration for cation-exchanged QDs that mitigates the influence of trap-assisted recombination. Cation-exchanged QDs have recently been employed in highly efficient and air-stable lead chalcogenide QD devices, and the reduced number of trap states inferred here may lead to improved current collection and higher open circuit voltage.","Elsevier","","Energy Frontier Research Centers (EFRC) (United States).

PIII is a lower-cost implantation technique than traditional beam line implantation due to its simpler design, lower operating costs, and ability to run high doses (1E14-1E18 cm<sup>-2</sup>) at low ion energies (20 eV-10 keV). These benefits make PIII ideal for high throughput production of patterned passivated contacts, where high-dose, low-energy implantations are made into thin (20-200 nm) a-Si layers instead of into the wafer itself. For this work symmetric passivated contact test structures (~100 nm thick) grown on <i>n-Cz</i> wafers with pH3 PIII doping gave implied open circuit voltage (iV<sub>oc</sub>) values of 730 mV with J<sub>o</sub> values of 2 fA/cm<sup>2</sup>.

However, if one could refurbish perovskite solar cells, their stability might not be a critical issue. From the perspective of cost effectiveness, if failed, perovskite solar cells could be collected and recycled; reuse of their gold electrodes and transparent conducting glasses could reduce the price per watt of perovskite photovoltaic modules. Here, we present a simple and effective method for removing the perovskite layer and reusing the mesoporous TiO<sub>2</sub>-coated transparent conducting glass substrate via selective dissolution. We find that the perovskite layer can be easily decomposed in polar aprotic solvents because of the reaction between polar aprotic solvents and Pb<sup>2+</sup> cations. After 10 cycles of recycling, a mesoporous TiO<sub>2</sub>-coated transparent conducting glass substrate-based perovskite solar cell still shows a constant power-conversion efficiency, thereby demonstrating the possibility of recycling perovskite solar cells.","Nature Publishing Group","","National Renewable Energy Lab.

Copper nitride (Cu<sub>3</sub>N) is a metastable semiconductor with a solar-relevant bandgap that has been reported to exhibit bipolar doping behavior. However, deeper understanding and better control of the mechanism behind this behavior in Cu<sub>3</sub>N is currently lacking in the literature. In this work, we use combinatorial growth with a temperature gradient to demonstrate both conduction types of phase-pure, sputter-deposited Cu<sub>3</sub>N thin films. Room temperature Hall effect and Seebeck effect measurements show n-type Cu<sub>3</sub>N with 10<sup>17</sup> electrons/cm<sup>3</sup> for low growth temperature (approximately 35 °C) and p-type with 10<sup>15</sup> holes/cm<sup>3</sup>-10<sup>16</sup> holes/cm<sup>3</sup> for elevated growth temperatures (50 °C-120 °C). Mobility for both types of Cu<sub>3</sub>N was approximately 0.1 cm<sup>2</sup>/Vs-1 cm<sup>2</sup>/Vs. Additionally, temperature-dependent Hall effect measurements indicate that ionized defects are an important scattering mechanism in p-type films. By combining X-ray absorption spectroscopy and first-principles defect theory, we determined that VCu defects form preferentially in p-type Cu<sub>3</sub>N, while Cui defects form preferentially in n-type Cu<sub>3</sub>N, suggesting that Cu<sub>3</sub>N is a compensated semiconductor with conductivity type resulting from a balance between donor and acceptor defects. Based on these theoretical and experimental results, we propose a kinetic defectformation mechanism for bipolar doping in Cu<sub>3</sub>N that is also supported by positron annihilation experiments. Altogether, the results of this work highlight the importance of kinetic processes in the defect physics of metastable materials and provide a framework that can be applied when considering the properties of such materials in general.","American Institute of Physics (AIP)","","National Renewable Energy Lab.

However, their development is limited by a large Schottky barrier (SB) at the metal-semiconductor junction (MSJ), which is difficult to tune by using conventional metals because of the effect of strong Fermi level pinning (FLP). We show that this problem can be overcome by using 2D metals, which are bounded with 2D semiconductors through van der Waals (vdW) interactions. This success relies on a weak FLP at the vdW MSJ, which is attributed to the suppression of metal-induced gap states. Consequently, the SB becomes tunable and can vanish with proper 2D metals (for example, H-NbS2). This work not only offers new insights into the fundamental properties of heterojunctions but also uncovers the great potential of 2D metals for device applications.","AAAS","","National Renewable Energy Lab.

Analysis of whether current technology can scale, in an economically sustainable way, to sufficient levels to meet these targets has not yet been undertaken, nor have tools to perform this analysis been presented. Here, we use bottom-up cost modeling to predict cumulative capacity as a function of technological and economic variables. We find that today's technology falls short in two ways: profits are too small relative to upfront factory costs to grow manufacturing capacity rapidly enough to meet climate targets, and costs are too high to generate enough demand to meet climate targets. We show that decreasing the capital intensity (capex) of PV manufacturing to increase manufacturing capacity and effectively reducing cost (e.g., through higher efficiency) to increase demand are the most effective and least risky ways to address these barriers to scale. We also assess the effects of variations in demand due to hard-to-predict factors, like public policy, on the necessary reductions in cost.Lastly, we review examples of redundant technology pathways for crystalline silicon PV to achieve the necessary innovations in capex, performance, and price.","Royal Society of Chemistry","","National Renewable Energy Lab.

To illuminate possible mechanisms for this enhancement and limits to beneficial K incorporation, the properties of Cu<sub>1-x</sub>K<sub>x</sub>InSe<sub>2</sub> (CKIS) thin-film alloys have been studied. Films with K/(K + Cu), or x, from 0 to 1 were grown by co-evaporation, and probed by XRF, EPMA, SEM, XRD, UV-Visible spectroscopy, current-voltage, and TRPL measurements. Composition from in situ quartz crystal and EIES monitoring was well correlated with final film composition. Crystal lattice parameters showed linear dependence on x, indicating complete K incorporation and coherent structural character at all compositions in the <100> and <010> lattice directions, despite the different symmetries of CuInSe<sub>2</sub> and KInSe<sub>2</sub>. The band gap energy showed pronounced bowing with x composition, in excellent agreement with experimental reports and semiconductor theory. Films of Mo/CKIS/Ni were non-ohmic, and increasing x from 0 to 0.58 decreased the apparent CKIS resistivity. Further evidence of decreased CKIS resistivity was observed with photoluminescence response, which increased by about half a decade for x > 0, and indicates increased majority carrier concentration. Minority carrier lifetimes increased by about an order of magnitude for films grown at x = 0.07 and 0.14, relative to CuInSe<sub>2</sub> and x ≥ 0.30. As a result, this is the first report of a Cu-K-In-Se film with >1 at.% K, and the observed property changes at increased x (wider band gap; lower resistivity; increased lifetime) comprise valuable photovoltaic performance-enhancement strategies, suggesting that CKIS alloys have a role to play in future engineering advances.","Springer","","National Renewable Energy Lab.

In particular, we demonstrate by comparison to explicit density functional theory calculations that for long oligomers the energies of the highest occupied molecular orbital (HOMO), the lowest unoccupied molecular orbital (LUMO), and of the first electronic excited state are accurately described as a function of number of repeat units by a simple effective Hamiltonian parameterized from electronic structure calculations on monomers, dimers and, optionally, tetramers. For the alternating copolymer materials that currently comprise some of the most efficient polymer organic photovoltaic devices one can use these simple but rigorous models to extrapolate computed properties to the polymer limit based on calculations on a small number of low-molecular-weight oligomers.","American Chemical Society","","National Renewable Energy Lab.

The effects of PA deposition method and time on the formation of close-packed, high-quality monolayers is investigated here for SAMs fabricated by solution deposition, micro-contact printing, and spray coating. The solution deposition isotherm for pentafluorinated benzylphosphonic acid (F5BnPA) on indium-doped zinc oxide (IZO) is studied using polarization modulation-infrared reflection-absorption spectroscopy (PM-IRRAS) at room temperature as a model PA/IZO system. Fast surface adsorption occurs within the first min; however, well-oriented high-quality SAMs are reached only after -48 h, presumably through a continual process of molecular adsorption/desorption and monolayer filling accompanied by molecular reorientation. Two other rapid, soak-free deposition techniques, micro-contact printing and spray coating, are also explored. SAM quality is compared for deposition of phenyl phosphonic acid (PPA), F13-octylphosphonic acid (F13OPA), and pentafluorinated benzyl phosphonic acid (F5BnPA) by solution deposition, micro-contact printing and spray coating using PM-IRRAS. In contrast to micro-contact printing and spray coating techniques, 48-168 h solution deposition at both room temperature and 70 degrees C result in contamination- and surface etch-free close-packed monolayers with good reproducibility.

X-ray and ultraviolet photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS and UPS) are commonly used to probe the difference between the Fermi level and valence band maximum (VBM) for crystalline and thin-film semiconductors. However, we find that when the standard XPS/UPS analysis is used for PbS, the results are often unrealistic due to the low density of states at the VBM. Instead, a parabolic band model is used to determine the VBM for the PbS QD films, which is based on the bulk PbS experimental spectrum and bulk GW calculations. Our analysis highlights the breakdown of the Brillioun zone representation of the band diagram for large band gap, highly quantum confined PbS QDs. We have also determined that in 1,2-ethanedithiol-treated PbS QD films the Fermi level position is dependent on the QD size; specifically, the smallest band gap QD films have the Fermi level near the conduction band minimum and the Fermi level moves away from the conduction band for larger band gap PbS QD films. This change in the Fermi level within the QD band gap could be due to changes in the Pb:S ratio. In addition, we use inverse photoelectron spectroscopy to measure the conduction band region, which has similar challenges in the analysis of PbS QD films due to a low density of states near the conduction band minimum.","American Chemical Society","","Energy Frontier Research Centers (EFRC) (United States).

Samples are sequentially etched to remove thin layers from each surface and MCLT is measured after each etch step. The thickness-removed (δt) at which the lifetime reaches a peak value corresponds to the damage depth. This technique also allows the damage to be quantified in terms of effective surface recombination velocity (S<sub>eff</sub>). To accomplish this, the MCLT data are converted into an S<sub>eff</sub> vs δt plot, which represents a quantitative distribution of the degree of damage within the surface layer. We describe a wafer preparation procedure to attain reproducible etching and MCLT measurement results. We also describe important characteristics of an etchant used for controllably removing thin layers from the wafer surfaces.

Morris","14 SOLAR ENERGY; 77 NANOSCIENCE AND NANOTECHNOLOGY; lithium-ion batteries; pseudocapacitors; catalysts; sensors; graphene/metal oxide (GMO) nanocomposites","Graphene/metal oxide (GMO) nanocomposites promise a broad range of utilities for lithium ion batteries (LIBs), pseudocapacitors, catalysts, and sensors. When applied as anodes for LIBs, GMOs often exhibit high capacity, improved rate capability and cycling performance. Numerous studies have attributed these favorable properties to a passive role played by the exceptional electronic and mechanical properties of graphene in enabling metal oxides (MOs) to achieve near-theoretical capacities. In contrast, the effects of MOs on the active lithium storage mechanisms of graphene remain enigmatic. Via a unique two-step solvent-directed sol-gel process, we have synthesized and directly compared the electrochemical performance of several representative GMOs, namely Fe2O3/graphene, SnO2/graphene, and TiO2/graphene. We observe that MOs can play an equally important role in empowering graphene to achieve large reversible lithium storage capacity. The magnitude of capacity improvement is found to scale roughly with the surface coverage of MOs, and depend sensitively on the type of MOs. We define a synergistic factor based on the capacity contributions. Our quantitative assessments indicate that the synergistic effect is most achievable in conversion-reaction GMOs (Fe2O3/graphene and SnO2/graphene) but not in intercalation-based TiO2/graphene. However, a long cycle stability up to 2000 cycles was observed in TiO2/graphene nanocomposites. We propose a surface coverage model to qualitatively rationalize the beneficial roles of MOs to graphene. Our first-principles calculations further suggest that the extra lithium storage sites could result from the formation of Li2O at the interface with graphene during the conversion-reaction. These results suggest an effective pathway for reversible lithium storage in graphene and shift design paradigms for graphene-based electrodes.","Royal Society of Chemistry","","National Renewable Energy Lab.

Coupled with active environmental species such as oxygen and moisture, the operating conditions pose a unique materials challenge for guaranteeing operational lifetimes of greater than 25 years. Specifically, the encapsulants used in the optical elements are susceptible to environmental degradation during operation. For example, the interfaces must remain in contact to prevent optical attenuation and thermal runaway. We developed fracture mechanics based metrologies to characterize the adhesion of the silicone encapsulant and its adjacent surfaces, as well as the cohesion of the encapsulant. Further, we studied the effects of weathering on adhesion using an outdoor concentrator operating in excess of 1100 times the AM1.5 direct irradiance and in indoor environmental chambers with broadband ultraviolet (UV) irradiation combined with controlled temperature and humidity. We observed a sharp initial increase in adhesion energy followed by a gradual decrease in adhesion as a result of both outdoor concentrator exposure and indoor UV weathering. We characterized changes in mechanical properties and chemical structures using XPS, FTIR, and DMA to understand the fundamental connection between mechanical strength and the degradation of the silicone encapsulant. We developed physics based models to explain the change in adhesion and to predict operational lifetimes of the materials and their interfaces.","Elsevier","","National Renewable Energy Lab.

Furthermore, the carrier lifetime of the sample with 4 e<sup>-</sup>/dot is found to increase at a slower rate than that of the undoped sample as temperature increases above 70 K. An Arrhenius plot of the temperature dependent PL intensity indicates that the thermal activation energy of electrons in the QDs, required for carrier escape from the dot ground state to continuum state, is increased when the d-doping density is high enough (>4 e<sup>-</sup>/dot). These results are attributed to the enhanced Coulomb interaction of electrons provided by the d-doping, leading to reduced thermal quenching of the PL.","IOP Publishing","","National Renewable Energy Lab.

The oxygen surface species are also monitored through a series of experiments that systematically investigates the effects of water and various solutions of: ammonium hydroxide, cadmium sulfate, and thiourea. These being components of cadmium sulfide chemical bath deposition (CBD). Characteristics of the CBD are correlated with a restorative effect that produces as normalized, uniform surface chemistry as measured by XAS. This surface chemistry is found in CIGS solar cells with excellent power conversion efficiency (&lt;19%). The results provide new insight for CIGS processing strategies that seek to replace CBD and/or cadmium sulfide.","Elsevier","","SLAC National Accelerator Lab., Menlo Park, CA (United States); National Renewable Energy Lab.

This quaternary alloy is of great importance to the development of III-V solar cells with five or more junctions and for cells optimized for operation at elevated temperatures because of the high bandgaps required in these designs. In this work, we explore the conditions for the organometallic vapor-phase epitaxy growth of AlGaInP and study their effects on cell performance. Initial efforts focused on developing ~2.0-eV AlGaInP solar cells with a nominal aluminum composition of 12%. Under the direct spectrum at 1000 W/m<sup>2</sup> (AM1.5D), the best of these samples had an open-circuit voltage of 1.59 V, a bandgap-voltage offset of 440 mV, a fill factor of 88.0%, and an efficiency of 14.8%. We then varied the aluminum composition of the alloy from 0% to 24% and were able to tune the bandgap of the AlGaInP layers from ~1.9 to ~2.2 eV. Furthermore, while the samples with a higher aluminum composition exhibited a reduced quantum efficiency and increased bandgap-voltage offset, the bandgap-voltage offset remained at 500 mV or less, up to a bandgap of ~2.1 eV.","IEEE","","National Renewable Energy Lab.

There are several methods of its preparation, most notably electrodeposition that has the potential for large areas and high volumes. Electrodeposition of ternary and/or quaternary semiconductors generally proceeds via the formation of a binary, which is subsequently reacted to form the ternary compound.

The statistical method of Latin Hypercube sampling was employed to investigate the sensitivity of simulated damage to each input variable. Variables of laminate material properties and their thicknesses were investigated. Using analysis of variance, we determined that the rate of solder fatigue was most sensitive to solder layer thickness, with copper ribbon and silicon thickness being the next two most sensitive variables. By simulating both accelerated thermal cycles (ATCs) and PV cell temperature histories through two characteristic days of service, we determined that the acceleration factor between the ATC and outdoor service was independent of the variables sampled in this study. This result implies that an ATC test will represent a similar time of outdoor exposure for a wide range of module designs. This is an encouraging result for the standard ATC that must be universally applied across all modules.","IEEE","","National Renewable Energy Lab.

A model is proposed for calculating the inverter heat-sink temperature based on the ambient temperature, the ratio of the consumed power to the rated power of the inverter, and the measured wind speed. To verify and study this model, more than one year of inverter DC/AC power, irradiance, wind speed, and heat sink temperature rise data were collected and analyzed.

"Paths to future growth in photovoltaics manufacturing","Basore, Paul A.","14 SOLAR ENERGY; 42 ENGINEERING; photovoltaics; manufacturing; Capex","The past decade has seen rapid growth in the photovoltaics industry, followed in the past few years by a period of much slower growth. A simple model that is consistent with this historical record can be used to predict the future evolution of the industry. Two key parameters are identified that determine the outcome. One is the annual global investment in manufacturing capacity normalized to the manufacturing capacity for the previous year (capacity-normalized capital investment rate, CapIR, units dollar/W). The other is how much capital investment is required for each watt of annual manufacturing capacity, normalized to the service life of the assets (capacity-normalized capital demand rate, CapDR, units dollar/W). If these two parameters remain unchanged from the values they have held for the past few years, global manufacturing capacity will peak in the next few years and then decline. However, it only takes a modest improvement in CapIR to ensure future growth in photovoltaics. Here, several approaches are presented that can enable the required improvement in CapIR. If, in addition, there is an accompanying improvement in CapDR, the rate of growth can be substantially accelerated.","Wiley","","National Renewable Energy Lab.

While the behavior of EHLs is generally understood, less attention has been devoted to systematically varying the onset of their formation and resulting properties. We report on an experimental approach to tune the conditions of formation and characteristics using a combination of low excitation densities and high magnetic fields up to 90 T. Demonstration of this approach was carried out in indirect-band-gap Al0.387Ga0.613As. EHL droplets can be nucleated from one of two multiexciton complex states depending on the applied excitation density. Furthermore, the excitation density influences the carrier density of the EHL at high magnetic fields, where filling of successive Landau levels can be controlled. The ability to manipulate the formation pathway, temperature, and carrier density of the EHL phase under otherwise fixed experimental conditions makes our approach a powerful tool for studying condensed carrier phases in further detail.","American Physical Society (APS)","","National Renewable Energy Lab.

On the other hand, the research paradigm of ‘colloidal atoms’ displays complexity of particle behaviour exceeding that of atomic counterparts, which is driven by DNA functionalization, geometric shape and topology and weak external stimuli. We describe elastic hexadecapoles formed by polymer microspheres dispersed in a liquid crystal, a nematic fluid of orientationally ordered molecular rods. Because of conically degenerate boundary conditions, the solid microspheres locally perturb the alignment of the nematic host, inducing hexadecapolar distortions that drive anisotropic colloidal interactions. We uncover physical underpinnings of formation of colloidal elastic hexadecapoles and report the ensuing bonding inaccessible to elastic dipoles, quadrupoles and other nematic colloids studied previously.","Nature Publishing Group","","National Renewable Energy Lab.

Most textbook examples assume that the recombination process occurs through a single defect level, where one electron and one hole are captured and recombined. Based on this simple picture, conventional wisdom is that only defect levels near the center of the bandgap can be effective recombination centers. Here, we present a new two-level recombination mechanism: first, one type of carrier is captured through a defect level forming a metastable state; then the local defect configuration rapidly changes to a stable state, where the other type of carrier is captured and recombined through another defect level. This novel mechanism is applied to the recombination center in CdTe. We show that this two-level process can significantly increase the recombination rate (by three orders of magnitude) in agreement with experiments. We expect that this two-level recombination process can exist in a wide range of semiconductors, so its effect should be carefully examined in characterizing optoelectronic materials.","Nature Publishing Group","","National Renewable Energy Lab.

A scalable approach to synthesize high-quality BLG is therefore critical, which requires minimal crystalline defects in both graphene layers and maximal area of Bernal stacking, which is necessary for bandgap tunability. Here we demonstrate that in an oxygen-activated chemical vapour deposition (CVD) process, half-millimetre size, Bernal-stacked BLG single crystals can be synthesized on Cu. Besides the traditional 'surface-limited' growth mechanism for SLG (1st layer), we discovered new microscopic steps governing the growth of the 2nd graphene layer below the 1st layer as the diffusion of carbon atoms through the Cu bulk after complete dehydrogenation of hydrocarbon molecules on the Cu surface, which does not occur in the absence of oxygen. Moreover, we found that the efficient diffusion of the carbon atoms present at the interface between Cu and the 1st graphene layer further facilitates growth of large domains of the 2nd layer. The CVD BLG has superior electrical quality, with a device on/off ratio greater than 104, and a tunable bandgap up to -100 meV at a displacement field of 0.9 V nm-1.","Nature Publishing Group","","National Renewable Energy Lab.

These point defects do not behave as isolated defects. Their spatial proximity enables them to hybridize into a one-dimensional band, and the distribution of resulting defect-band states is determined by both the position of the band and its dispersion. In the case of glissile 90° partial dislocations in III-V semiconductors, the dislocation core can adopt a variety of different reconstructions. Each of these reconstructions has a different arrangement of point defects, which affects the hybridization into defect bands and their associated dispersion. Furthermore, we illustrate these principles by performing first-principles calculations for InAs and find that some defect levels for InAs dislocations lie outside of the band gap where they cannot act as recombination centers. To provide some insight into the electronic structure of dislocations in ternary alloys, some examples relevant to InGaAs and GaAsP are included.","American Institute of Physics (AIP)","","National Renewable Energy Lab.

"A Fast All-sky Radiation Model for Solar applications (FARMS): Algorithm and performance evaluation","Xie, Yu; Sengupta, Manajit; Dudhia, Jimy","14 SOLAR ENERGY; 47 OTHER INSTRUMENTATION; solar radiation; radiative transfer model; cloud","Radiative transfer (RT) models simulating broadband solar radiation have been widely used by atmospheric scientists to model solar resources for various energy applications such as operational forecasting. Due to the complexity of solving the RT equation, the computation under cloudy conditions can be extremely time-consuming, though many approximations (e.g., two-stream approach and delta-M truncation scheme) have been utilized. Thus, a more efficient RT model is crucial for model developers as a new option for approximating solar radiation at the land surface with minimal loss of accuracy. In this study, we developed a fast all-sky radiation model for solar applications (FARMS) using the simplified clear-sky RT model, REST2, and simulated cloud transmittances and reflectances from the Rapid Radiation Transfer Model (RRTM) with a 16-stream Discrete Ordinates Radiative Transfer (DISORT). Simulated lookup tables (LUTs) of cloud transmittances and reflectances are created by varying cloud optical thicknesses, cloud particle sizes, and solar zenith angles. Equations with optimized parameters are fitted to the cloud transmittances and reflectances to develop the model. The all-sky solar irradiance at the land surface can then be computed rapidly by combining REST2 with the cloud transmittances and reflectances. This new RT model is more than 1,000 times faster than those currently utilized in solar resource assessment and forecasting because it does not explicitly solve the RT equation for each individual cloud condition. Our results indicate that the accuracy of the fast radiative transfer model is comparable to or better than two-stream approximation in term of computing cloud transmittance and solar radiation.","Elsevier","","National Renewable Energy Lab.

Most of this effort has been directed toward overcoming the two main technical challenges: 1) removing atmospheric oxygen and carbon contamination and 2) establishing the conditions needed for 'APD-free' III-V epitaxy (i.e., without antiphase domains). We have developed an OMVPE process for APD-free GaP growth on Si which overcomes both challenges by using AsH3 to clean and prepare the Si surface in situ at a relatively low temperature. This process is based upon a very brief 'AsH3-cleaning' step which simultaneously removes atmospheric contamination (thereby eliminating the need for Si regrowth) and creates a single-domain As-terminated Si surface.

The combination of dark lock-in thermography (DLIT) imaging, electron beam induced current imaging, and both transmission and scanning transmission electron microscopy (TEM/STEM) on the same location revealed the nanoscale origin of the optoelectronic properties of shunts visible at the device scale. Our site-specific correlative approach identified the shunt behavior to be a result of three-dimensional inversion channels around structural defects decorated with oxide precipitates. These inversion channels facilitate enhanced minority-carrier transport that results in the increased heating observed through DLIT imaging. The definitive connection between the nanoscale structure and chemistry of the type of shunt investigated here allows photovoltaic device manufacturers to immediately address the oxygen content of their mc-Si absorber material when such features are present, instead of engaging in costly characterization.","Elsevier","","National Renewable Energy Lab.

Here we present the opto-electronic properties, including optical band gap, electron affinity, and charge carrier density, for amorphous GaO<sub>x</sub> thin films deposited by pulsed laser deposition. These properties are strongly dependent on the deposition temperature during the deposition process. The deposition temperature has no significant influence on the general structural properties but produces significant changes in the oxygen stoichiometry of the films. Here, the density of the oxygen vacancies is found to be related to the optical band gap of the GaO<sub>x</sub> layer. It is proposed that the oxygen deficiency leads to defect band below the conduction band minimum that increases the electron affinity. These properties facilitate the use of amorphous GaO<sub>x</sub> as an electron transport layer in Cu(In,Ga)Se<sub>2</sub> and in Cu<sub>2</sub>O solar cells.

Pt-Ni nanowires exhibit promising ORR mass activities (3 times greater than Pt nanoparticles, 1.5 times greater than U.S. Department of Energy target) both before and after potential cycling for all but the highest annealing temperatures explored. The annealing of Pt-Ni nanowires in oxygen with increasing temperature is found to reduce surface area and ORR activity in comparison to the untreated material, but also reduces activity losses following durability testing. Following potential cycling, unannealed Pt-Ni nanowires show significant losses in surface area (23%) and specific activity (18%) while Pt-Ni nanowires annealed at 200°C show modest increases in surface area (2%) and specific activity (6%) after potential cycling. Increasing annealing temperatures also show a clear trend of decreasing Ni dissolution rates. While oxygen annealing has shown the ability to improve durability of Pt-Ni nanowires, significant Ni dissolution was observed in all samples and suggests oxide passivation while showing promise for improved durability, when employed by itself is insufficient to prevent all contamination concerns involving Ni dissolution.","The Electrochemical Society","","National Renewable Energy Lab.

For the small NCs, the fast dynamics appear to result from thermal promotion of residual low-spin states to high-spin states following nonradiative decay, and the size dependence is postulated to arise from differing high-spin vs low-spin fractions in domains residing in strained surface regions. The SCO is less efficient in larger NCs owing to their larger size and hence lower residual LS/HS fractions. Our results suggest that size-dependent dynamics can be controlled by tuning surface energy in NCs with dimensions below ~25 nm for use in energy harvesting, spin switching, and other applications.","American Chemical Society","","National Renewable Energy Lab.

Here, we show a series of in situ observations inside electron microscopes and X-ray diffractometers under device-relevant synthesis conditions focused on revealing the crystallization process of the formamidinium lead-triiodide perovskite at the optimum temperature of 175 degrees C. Direct in situ observations of the structure and chemistry over relevant spatial, temporal, and temperature scales enabled identification of key perovskite formation and degradation mechanisms related to grain evolution and interface chemistry. The lead composition was observed to fluctuate at grain boundaries, indicating a mobile lead-containing species, a process found to be partially reversible at a key temperature of 175 degrees C. Using low energy electron microscopy and valence electron energy loss spectroscopy, lead is found to be bonded in the grain interior with iodine in a tetrahedral configuration. At the grain boundaries, the binding energy associated with lead is consequently shifted by nearly 2 eV and a doublet peak is resolved due presumably to a greater degree of hybridization and the potential for several different bonding configurations. At the grain boundaries there is adsorption of hydrogen and OH- ions as a result of residual water vapor trapped as a non-crystalline material during formation. Insights into the relevant formation and decomposition reactions of formamidinium lead iodide at low to high temperatures, observed metastabilities, and relationship with the photovoltaic performance were obtained and used to optimize device processing resulting in conversion efficiencies of up to 17.09% within the stability period of the devices.","Royal Society of Chemistry","","National Renewable Energy Lab.

Here we show that incorporation of selected deep level defects in the carrier-collecting region, however, can be utilized to improve the efficiency of optoelectronic devices. The designed defects can help the transport of the majority carriers by creating defect levels that is resonant with the band edge state, and/or reduce the concentration of minority carriers through Coulomb repulsion, thus suppressing the recombination at the carrier-collecting region. The selection process is demonstrated by using Si solar cell as an example. In conclusion, our work enriches the understanding and utilization of the semiconductor defects.","American Institute of Physics (AIP)","","National Renewable Energy Lab.

To investigate the possibility of creep, modules were constructed, using several thermoplastic encapsulant materials, into thin-film mock modules and deployed in Mesa, Arizona. The materials examined included poly(ethylene)-co-vinyl acetate (EVA, including formulations both cross-linked and with no curing agent), polyethylene/polyoctene copolymer (PO), poly(dimethylsiloxane) (PDMS), polyvinyl butyral (PVB), and thermoplastic polyurethane (TPU). The absence of creep in this experiment is attributable to several factors of which the most notable one was the unexpected cross-linking of an EVA formulation without a cross-linking agent. It was also found that some materials experienced both chain scission and cross-linking reactions, sometimes with a significant dependence on location within a module. The TPU and EVA samples were found to degrade with cross-linking reactions dominating over chain scission. In contrast, the PO materials degraded with chain scission dominating over cross-linking reactions. Furthermore, we found no significant indications that viscous creep is likely to occur in fielded modules capable of passing the qualification tests, we note that one should consider how a polymer degrades, chain scission or cross-linking, in assessing the suitability of a thermoplastic polymer in terrestrial photovoltaic applications.","Wiley Blackwell (John Wiley & Sons)","","National Renewable Energy Lab.

Here, the controlled spalling technique is a recently developed substrate removal process that utilizes the physics of fracture to create wafer cleavage parallel to the surface at a precise depth. In this letter, we apply principles of linear elastic fracture mechanics to predict the process conditions needed to exfoliate (100) GaAs of a desired thickness. Spalling can be initiated in a controllable manner, by depositing a stressor film of a residual stress value just below the threshold value to induce a spontaneous spall. Experimental data show process window requirements to controllably spall (100) GaAs. Additionally, experimental spall depth in (100) GaAs compares well to spalling mechanics predictions when the effects of wafer thickness and modulus are considered. To test spalled material quality, III-V single junction photovoltaic devices are lifted off of a (100)-GaAs substrate by spalling methods and electrical characteristics are recorded. No degradation is observed in the spalled device, illustrating the potential of this method to rapidly produce thin, high quality devices.","American Institute of Physics (AIP)","","National Renewable Energy Lab.

The interaction is monitored in a single quantum system in the bulk of a liquid crystal medium where nanoparticles are manipulated and nanoconfined far from dielectric interfaces using laser tweezers and topological configurations containing singularities. When quantum dot-in-a-rod particles are spatially colocated with a plasmonic gold nanoburst particle in a topological singularity core, its fluorescence increases because blinking is significantly suppressed and the radiative decay rate increases by nearly an order of magnitude owing to the Purcell effect. We argue that the blinking suppression is the result of the radiative rate change that mitigates Auger recombination and quantum dot ionization, consequently reducing nonradiative recombination. Our work demonstrates that topological singularities are an effective platform for studying and controlling plasmon-exciton interactions.","American Chemical Society (ACS)","","National Renewable Energy Lab.

Herein, we report a striking contrast at approximately 45 degrees C in the ionic/electrical properties of MAPbl3 owing to a change of the ion activation energy from 0.7 to 0.5 eV, whereas the optical properties exhibit no particular transition except for the steady increase of the bandgap with temperature. These observations can be explained by the 'continuous' nature of perovskite phase transition. We speculate that the critical temperature at which the ionic/electrical properties change, although related to crystal symmetry variation, is not necessarily the same temperature as when tetragonal-cubic structural phase transition occurs.","ChemPubSoc Europe","","National Renewable Energy Lab.

"Re-examination of the Pt Particle Size Effect on the Oxygen Reduction Reaction for Ultrathin Uniform Pt/C Catalyst Layers without Influence from Nafion","Shinozaki, Kazuma; Morimoto, Yu; Pivovar, Bryan S.; Kocha, Shyam S.","14 SOLAR ENERGY; 30 DIRECT ENERGY CONVERSION; oxygen reduction reaction; platinum; particle size effect; rotating disk electrode method; nafion-free activity","The platinum 'particle size effect' on the oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) has been re-evaluated using commercial Pt/C catalysts (2-10 nm Pt particle) and polycrystalline Pt (poly-Pt) in 0.1 M HClO4 with a rotating disk electrode method. Nafion-free catalyst layers were employed to obtain specific activities (SA) that were not perturbed (suppressed) by sulfonate anion adsorption/blocking. By using ultrathin uniform catalyst layers, O2 diffusion limitation was minimized as confirmed from the high SAs of our supported catalysts that were comparable to unsupported sputtered Pt having controlled sizes. The specific activity (SA) steeply increased for the particle sizes in the range -2-10 nm (0.8-1.8 mA/cm2Pt at 0.9 V vs. RHE) and plateaued over -10 nm to 2.7 mA/cm2Pt for bulk poly-Pt. On the basis of the activity trend for the range of particle sizes studied, it appears that the effect of carbon support on activity is negligible. The experimental results and the concomitant profile of SA vs. particle size was found to be in an agreement to a truncated octahedral particle model that assumes active terrace sites.","Elsevier","","National Renewable Energy Lab.

"Damage in Monolithic Thin-Film Photovoltaic Modules Due to Partial Shade","Silverman, Timothy J.; Mansfield, Lorelle; Repins, Ingrid; Kurtz, Sarah","14 SOLAR ENERGY; 36 MATERIALS SCIENCE; photovoltaics; module; reliability; thin film; CIGS; CdTe; shade","The typical configuration of monolithic thin-film photovoltaic modules makes it possible for partial shade to place one or more cells in such a module in reverse bias. Reverse bias operation leads to high voltage, current density, and power density conditions, which can act as driving forces for failure. We showed that a brief outdoor shadow event can cause a 7% permanent loss in power. We applied an indoor partial shade durability test that moves beyond the standard hot spot endurance test by using more realistic mask and bias conditions and by carefully quantifying the permanent change in performance due to the stress. With the addition of a pass criterion based on change in maximum power, this procedure will soon be proposed as a part of the module-type qualification test. All six commercial copper indium gallium diselenide and cadmium telluride modules we tested experienced permanent damage due to the indoor partial shade test, ranging from 4% to 14% loss in maximum power. We conclude by summarizing ways to mitigate partial shade stress at the cell, module, and system levels.","IEEE","","National Renewable Energy Lab.

The temperature-dependent J01 and J02 dark currents are extracted by fitting current-voltage measurements to a two-diode model. We find that the intrinsic carrier concentration ni dominates the temperature dependence of the dark currents, open-circuit voltage, and cell efficiency. To study the impact of temperature on the photocurrent and bandgap of the solar cells, we measure the quantum efficiency and illuminated current-voltage characteristics of the devices up to 400 degrees C. As the temperature is increased, we observe no degradation to the internal quantum efficiency and a decrease in the bandgap. These two factors drive an increase in the short-circuit current density at high temperatures. Finally, we measure the devices at concentrations ranging from ~30 to 1500 suns and observe n = 1 recombination characteristics across the entire temperature range. These findings should be a valuable guide to the design of any system that requires high-temperature solar cell operation.","IEEE","","National Renewable Energy Lab.

For a reference case where sputtering plus batch sulfurization after selenization (SAS) is employed, we compute a manufacturing cost of $69/m2 if the modules are made in the United States at a 1 GW/year production volume. At 14% module efficiency, this corresponds to a manufacturing cost of $0.49/WDC and a minimum sustainable price (MSP) of $0.67/WDC. We estimate that MSP could vary within +/-20% of this value given the range of quoted input prices, and existing variations in module design, manufacturing processes, and manufacturing location. Potential for reduction in manufacturing costs to below $0.40/WDC may be possible if average production module efficiencies can be increased above 17% without increasing $/m2 costs; even lower costs could be achieved if $/m2 costs could be reduced, particularly via innovations in the CIGS deposition process or balance-of-module elements. We present the impact on cost of regional factors, CIGS deposition method, device design, and price fluctuations. One metric of competitiveness-levelized cost of energy (LCOE) -- is also assessed for several U.S. locations and compared to that of standard multi-crystalline silicon (m(c-Si)) and cadmium telluride (CdTe).","","","National Renewable Energy Lab.

This paper presents a study on tunnel oxide passivated contacts formed by low-energy ion implantation into amorphous silicon (a-Si) layers and examines the influence of the ion species (P, B, or BF2), the ion implantation dose (5 × 10<sup>14</sup> cm<sup>–2</sup> to 1 × 10<sup>16</sup> cm<sup>–2</sup>), and the subsequent high-temperature anneal (800 °C or 900 °C) on the passivation quality and junction characteristics using double-sided contacted silicon solar cells. Excellent passivation quality is achieved for n-type passivated contacts by P implantations into either intrinsic (undoped) or in-situ B-doped a-Si layers with implied open-circuit voltages (iV<sub>oc</sub>) of 725 and 720 mV, respectively. For p-type passivated contacts, BF2 implantations into intrinsic a-Si yield well passivated contacts and allow for iV<sub>oc</sub> of 690 mV, whereas implanted B gives poor passivation with iV<sub>oc</sub> of only 640 mV. While solar cells featuring in-situ B-doped selective hole contacts and selective electron contacts with P implanted into intrinsic a-Si layers achieved V<sub>oc</sub> of 690 mV and fill factor (FF) of 79.1%, selective hole contacts realized by BF<sub>2</sub> implantation into intrinsic a-Si suffer from drastically reduced FF which is caused by a non-Ohmic Schottky contact. Lastly, implanting P into in-situ B-doped a-Si layers for the purpose of overcompensation (counterdoping) allowed for solar cells with V<sub>oc</sub> of 680 mV and FF of 80.4%, providing a simplified and promising fabrication process for IBC solar cells featuring passivated contacts.","American Institute of Physics (AIP)","","National Renewable Energy Lab.

By performing X-ray photoemission spectroscopy, we induce and track dynamic chemical and electronic transformations in the perovskite. These data show compositional changes that begin immediately with exposure to X-ray irradiation, whereas the predominant electronic structure of the thin film on compact TiO2 appears tolerant to the formation of compensating defect pairs of VI and VMA and for a large range of I/Pb ratios. Changing film composition is correlated with a shift of the valence-band maximum only as the halide-lead ratio drops below 2.5. This delay is attributed to the invariance of MAPbI3 electronic structure to distributed defects that can significantly transform the electronic density of states only when in high concentrations.","American Chemical Society (ACS)","","National Renewable Energy Lab.

This could be misleading in some circumstance. Here we clarify that: (1) Because the Fermi-level pinning is determined not only by defect states but also by free carriers from band-edge states, band-edge states should be treated explicitly in the same footing as the defect states in practice; (2) defect formation energy, thus defect density, could be pinned and independent on atomic chemical potentials due to the entanglement of atomic chemical potentials and Fermi energy, in contrast to the usual expectation that defect formation energy can always be tuned by varying the atomic chemical potentials; and (3) the charged defect compensation behavior, i.e., most of donors are compensated by acceptors or vice versa, is self-regulated when defect formation energies are pinned. The last two phenomena are more dominant in wide-gap semiconductors or when the defect formation energies are small. Using NaCl and CH<sub>3</sub>NH<sub>3</sub>PbI<sub>3</sub> as examples, we illustrate these unexpected behaviors. Furthermore, our analysis thus provides new insights that enrich the understanding of the defect physics in semiconductors and insulators.","Nature Publishing Group","","National Renewable Energy Lab.

However, questions remain on the growth mechanisms of chemical bath deposited ZnOS. In this study, a detailed model is employed to calculate solubility diagrams that describe simple conditions for complex speciation control using only ammonium hydroxide without additional base. For these conditions, ZnOS is deposited via aqueous solution deposition on a quartz crystal microbalance in a continuous flow cell. Data is used to analyze the growth rate dependence on temperature and also to elucidate the effects of dimethylsulfoxide (DMSO) when used as a co-solvent.

SF has been comprehensively studied in one polymoprh (Tc I), but not in the other, less stable polymorph (Tc II). Using carefully controlled thermal evaporation deposition conditions and high sensitivity ultrafast transient absorption spectroscopy, we found that for large crystallite size samples, SF in nearly pure Tc II films is significantly faster than SF in Tc I films. We also discovered that crystallite size has a minimal impact on the SF rate in Tc II films, but a significant influence in Tc I films. Large crystallites exhibit SF times of 125 ps and 22 ps in Tc I and Tc II, respectively, whereas small crystallites have SF times of 31 ps and 33 ps. Our results demonstrate first, that attention must be paid to polymorphism in obtaining a self-consistent rate picture for SF in tetracene and second, that control of polymorphism can play a significant role towards achieving a mechanistic understanding of SF in polycrystalline systems. In this latter context we show that conventional theory based on non-covalent tetracene couplings is insufficient, thus highlighting the need for models that capture the delocalized and highly mobile nature of excited states in elucidating the full photophysical picture.","Royal Society of Chemistry","","National Renewable Energy Lab.

We found that the conditions of the microwave conductivity measurement allow us to avoid the complications of most previous measurements of nanotube free-carrier generation, including tube–tube/tube–electrode contact, dielectric screening by nearby excitons and many-body interactions. At low photon fluence (approximately 0.05 excitons per μm length of tubes), we directly observe free carriers on excitation of the first and second carbon nanotube exciton transitions.","Nature Publishing Group","","National Renewable Energy Lab.

"Baseline and target values for regional and point PV power forecasts: Toward improved solar forecasting","Zhang, Jie; Hodge, Bri -Mathias; Lu, Siyuan; Hamann, Hendrik F.; Lehman, Brad; Simmons, Joseph; Campos, Edwin; Banunarayanan, Venkat; Black, Jon; Tedesco, John","14 SOLAR ENERGY; 29 ENERGY PLANNING, POLICY, AND ECONOMY; numerical weather prediction; operating reserve; ramp forecasting; PV power forecasting; National Renewable Energy Laboratory; NREL","Accurate solar photovoltaic (PV) power forecasting allows utilities to reliably utilize solar resources on their systems. However, to truly measure the improvements that any new solar forecasting methods provide, it is important to develop a methodology for determining baseline and target values for the accuracy of solar forecasting at different spatial and temporal scales. This paper aims at developing a framework to derive baseline and target values for a suite of generally applicable, value-based, and custom-designed solar forecasting metrics. The work was informed by close collaboration with utility and independent system operator partners. The baseline values are established based on state-of-the-art numerical weather prediction models and persistence models in combination with a radiative transfer model. The target values are determined based on the reduction in the amount of reserves that must be held to accommodate the uncertainty of PV power output. The proposed reserve-based methodology is a reasonable and practical approach that can be used to assess the economic benefits gained from improvements in accuracy of solar forecasting. Lastly, the financial baseline and targets can be translated back to forecasting accuracy metrics and requirements, which will guide research on solar forecasting improvements toward the areas that are most beneficial to power systems operations.","Elsevier","","National Renewable Energy Lab.

"Model for Deriving the Direct Normal and Diffuse Horizontal Irradiance from the Global Tilted Irradiance","Marion, Bill","14 SOLAR ENERGY; 36 MATERIALS SCIENCE; Direct and diffuse irradiance; Global tilted irradiance; Model","We developed a separation model for deriving the direct normal irradiance (DNI) and the diffuse horizontal irradiance (DHI) from the global tilted irradiance (GTI). The model is based on the DIRINT model, but substitutes the use of the GTI in place of the global horizontal irradiance (GHI) for determining the global clearness index (Kt). Additionally, an iterative method is used to adjust Kt to improve the derived values of the DNI and the DHI. The model is referred to as the GTI-DIRINT model. When using for model input the GTI measured with a pyranometer tilted at a small angle from the horizontal (10°), the deviations between the measured DNI and DHI and the GTI-DIRINT-modeled DNI and DHI were essentially the same as those for the DIRINT model when using the GHI for model input. Increasing the tilt angle from horizontal (as great as 44° for Eugene, Oregon) increased the deviations between the modeled and measured DNI and DHI, but our results were still reasonable. The GTI-DIRINT model provides reasonable values of DNI and DHI from the GTI, and if they are subsequently used with the Perez tilted surface model to model the GTI for orientations within 30° of the azimuth and tilt of the GTI used for model input, the result is as good or better than may be obtained when using a measured DNI and DHI, and without their significant instrumentation cost.","Elsevier","","National Renewable Energy Lab.

To investigate whether the improved optical quality of these films results from a reduction in the concentration of deep level defects, p+/n and n+/p junction diodes were fabricated on both the illuminated and dark areas of several samples. Deep Level Transient Spectroscopy (DLTS) measurements show that the illuminated and dark areas of both the n- and p-type GaAs1-xBix epi-layers have similar concentrations of near mid-gap electron and hole traps, in the 1015 cm-3 range. Thus the improved PL spectra cannot be explained by a reduction in non-radiative recombination at deep level defects. We note that carrier freeze-out above 35 K is significantly reduced in the illuminated areas of the p-type GaAs1-xBix layers compared to the dark areas, allowing the first DLTS measurements of defect energy levels close to the valence band edge. These defect levels may account for differences in the PL spectra from the illuminated and dark areas of un-doped layers with a similar Bi fraction.","IOP Publishing","","National Renewable Energy Lab.

"Review on first-principles study of defect properties of CdTe as a solar cell absorber","Yang, Ji-Hui; Yin, Wan-Jian; Park, Ji-Sang; Ma, Jie; Wei, Su-Huai","14 SOLAR ENERGY; 36 MATERIALS SCIENCE; defect control; CdTe; solar cell","CdTe is one of the leading materials for high-efficiency, low-cost, and thin-film solar cells. In this work, we review the recent first-principles study of defect properties of CdTe and present that: (1) When only intrinsic defects are present, p-type doping in CdTe is weak and the hole density is low due to the relatively deep acceptor levels of Cd vacancy. (2) When only intrinsic defects present, the dominant non-radiative recombination center in p-type CdTe is Te-2+/Cd, which limits the carrier lifetime to be around 200 ns. (3) Extrinsic p-type doping in CdTe by replacing Te with group V elements generally will be limited by the formation of AX centers. This could be overcome through a non-equilibrium cooling process and the hole density can achieve 10^17 cm-3. However, the long-term stability will be a challenging issue. (4) Extrinsic p-type doping by replacing Cd with alkaline group I elements is limited by alkaline interstitials and a non-equilibrium cooling process can efficiently enhance the hole density to the order of 10^17 cm-3. (5) Cu and Cl treatments are discussed. In bulk CdTe, Cu can enhance p-type doping, but Cl is found to be unsuitable for this. Both Cu and Cl show segregation at grain boundaries, especially at those with Te-Te wrong bonds. (6) External impurities are usually incorporated by diffusion. Therefore, the diffusion processes in CdTe are investigated. We find that cation interstitial (Nai, Cui) diffusion follows relatively simple diffusion paths, but anion diffusion (Cli, Pi) follows more complicated paths due to the degenerated defect wavefunctions.","IOP Publishing","","National Renewable Energy Lab.

Toward this goal, careful optimization of material properties and device performance is of utmost interest. Here, we show that exposure of polycrystalline Zn-doped TF-VLS InP to a hydrogen plasma (in the following referred to as hydrogenation) results in improved optoelectronic quality as well as lateral optoelectronic uniformity. A combination of low temperature photoluminescence and transient photocurrent spectroscopy was used to analyze the energy position and relative density of defect states before and after hydrogenation. Notably, hydrogenation reduces the relative intragap defect density by 1 order of magnitude. As a metric to monitor lateral optoelectronic uniformity of polycrystalline TF-VLS InP, photoluminescence and electron beam induced current mapping reveal homogenization of the grain versus grain boundary upon hydrogenation. At the device level, we measured more than 260 TF-VLS InP solar cells before and after hydrogenation to verify the improved optoelectronic properties. Hydrogenation increased the average open-circuit voltage (VOC) of individual TF-VLS InP solar cells by up to 130 mV and reduced the variance in VOC for the analyzed devices.","American Chemical Society (ACS)","","National Renewable Energy Lab.

Herein, we report on the synthesis and crystallization of organic-inorganic formamidinium lead triiodide perovskite films under controlled atmospheric and environmental conditions. Using in situ (scanning) transmission electron microscopy, we make observations of the crystallization process of these materials in nitrogen and oxygen gas with and without the presence of water vapor. Complementary planar samples were also fabricated in the presence of water vapor and characterized by in situ X-ray diffraction. Direct observations of the material structure and final morphology indicate that the exposure to water vapor results in a porous film that is metastable, regardless of the presence of argon, nitrogen, or oxygen. However, the optimal crystallization temperature of 175 degrees C is unperturbed across conditions. Rapid modulation about the annealing temperature of 175 degrees C in +/-25 degrees C steps (150-200 degrees C) promotes crystallization and significantly improves the film morphology by overcoming the presence of impregnated water trapped in the material. Following this processing protocol, we demonstrate substantial growth to micron-size grains via observation inside of an environmentally controlled transmission electron microscope. Adapting this insight from our in situ microscopy, we are able to provide an informed materials protocol to control the structure and morphology of these organic-inorganic semiconductors, which is readily applicable to benchtop device growth strategies.","American Chemical Society (ACS)","","National Renewable Energy Lab.

A large number of scientists and engineers from academia and industry met together to discuss the progress of perovskite solar cells (PSCs) and the understanding of the critical science related to PSCs. This symposium included 18 invited talks, 67 contributing talks, 130 posters, and more than 300 participants. These numbers clearly indicate that the surge in research interest continues in this emerging solar cell technology. Just a couple of months before this symposium, a new power conversion efficiency (PCE) record of 22.1% was released by Sang Il Seok's group (KRICT/UNIST, South Korea). Such a swift rise of PSC efficiency within only 6 years has been unprecedented in the history of photovoltaic (PV) technology. Of course, several challenges remain (for example, scaled-up fabrication, stability, toxicity, and hysteresis) before PSCs can successfully enter the PV market. However, the perceived huge potential of this future lab-to-market transition has stimulated myriad efforts from both the scientific community and industry.

This has become a significant topic of discussion in the development of IEC 61730 and IEC 61215. We constructed eight pairs of crystalline-silicon modules and eight pairs of glass/encapsulation/glass thin-film mock modules using different encapsulant materials, of which only two were formulated to chemically crosslink. One module set was exposed outdoors with thermal insulation on the back side in Mesa, Arizona, in the summer (hot-dry), and an identical module set was exposed in environmental chambers. High-precision creep measurements (±20 μm) and electrical performance measurements indicate that despite many of these polymeric materials operating in the melt or rubbery state during outdoor deployment, no significant creep was seen because of their high viscosity, lower operating temperature at the edges, and/or the formation of chemical crosslinks in many of the encapsulants with age despite the absence of a crosslinking agent. Only an ethylene-vinyl acetate (EVA) encapsulant formulated without a peroxide crosslinking agent crept significantly. When the crystalline-silicon modules, the physical restraint of the backsheet reduced creep further and was not detectable even for the EVA without peroxide. Because of the propensity of some polymeric materials to crosslink as they age, typical thermoplastic encapsulants would be unlikely to result in creep in the vast majority of installations.","Wiley Blackwell (John Wiley & Sons)","","National Renewable Energy Lab.

It is shown that the rate of solder fatigue damage is not ranked with the cities' climate designations. For an accurate ranking, the mean maximum daily temperature, daily temperature change and a characteristic of clouding events are all required. A physics-based empirical equation is presented that accurately calculates solder fatigue damage according to these three factors. An FEM comparison of solder damage accumulated through service and thermal cycling demonstrates the number of cycles required for an equivalent exposure. For an equivalent 25-year exposure, the number of thermal cycles (-40 degrees C to 85 degrees C) required ranged from roughly 100 to 630 for the cities examined. It is demonstrated that increasing the maximum cycle temperature may significantly reduce the number of thermal cycles required for an equivalent exposure.","","","National Renewable Energy Lab.

"The Voltage Boost Enabled by Luminescence Extraction in Solar Cells","Ganapati, Vidya; Steiner, Myles A.; Yablonovitch, Eli","14 SOLAR ENERGY; 36 MATERIALS SCIENCE; luminescence; photovoltaic cells; solar energy","Over the past few years, the application of the physical principle, i.e., 'luminescence extraction,' has produced record voltages and efficiencies in photovoltaic cells. Luminescence extraction is the use of optical design, such as a back mirror or textured surfaces, to help internal photons escape out of the front surface of a solar cell. The principle of luminescence extraction is exemplified by the mantra 'a good solar cell should also be a good LED.' Basic thermodynamics says that the voltage boost should be related to concentration ratio C of a resource by ΔV = (kT/q) ln{C}. In light trapping (i.e., when the solar cell is textured and has a perfect back mirror), the concentration ratio of photons C = {4n<sup>2</sup>}; therefore, one would expect a voltage boost of ΔV = (kT/q) ln{4n<sup>2</sup>} over a solar cell with no texture and zero back reflectivity, where n is the refractive index. Nevertheless, there has been ambiguity over the voltage benefit to be expected from perfect luminescence extraction. Do we gain an open-circuit voltage boost of ΔV = (kT/q) ln{n<sup>2</sup>}, ΔV = (kT/q) ln{2 n<sup>2</sup>}, or ΔV = (kT/q) ln{4 n<sup>2</sup>}? What is responsible for this voltage ambiguity ΔV = (kT/q) ln{4} ${\asymp}$ 36 mV? Finally, we show that different results come about, depending on whether the photovoltaic cell is optically thin or thick to its internal luminescence. In realistic intermediate cases of optical thickness, the voltage boost falls in between: ln{n<sup>2</sup>} < (qΔV/kT) < ln{4n <sup>2</sup>}.","Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers","","National Renewable Energy Lab.

The objective is to bridge the temporal gap between long-term system optimization and real-time inverter control, and enable seamless PV-owner participation without compromising system efficiency and stability. The design of the controllers is grounded on a dual ..epsilon..-subgradient method, while semidefinite programming relaxations are advocated to bypass the non-convexity of AC OPF formulations. Global convergence of inverter output powers is analytically established for diminishing stepsize rules for cases where: i) computational limits dictate asynchronous updates of the controller signals, and ii) inverter reference inputs may be updated at a faster rate than the power-output settling time.","IEEE","","National Renewable Energy Lab.

The model is evaluated for dislocations gliding through CuPt-ordered GaInP and GaInAs, where the boundary energy is negative and the boundary is stable. With ordering present, the critical thickness is significantly lowered and remains finite as the mismatch strain approaches zero. The reduction in critical thickness is most significant when the order parameter is greatest and the amount of misfit energy is low. The modified model is experimentally validated for low-misfit GaInP epilayers with varying order parameters using in situ wafer curvature and ex situ cathodoluminescence. With strong ordering, relaxation begins at a lower thickness and occurs at a greater rate, which is consistent with a lower critical thickness and increased glide force. Furthermore, atomic ordering is an important consideration for the stability of lattice-mismatched devices.","American Institute of Physics (AIP)","","National Renewable Energy Lab.

However, all films showed the lowest resistivity and highest mobilities when the oxygen partial pressure in the sputter ambient was zero. This result is contrasted with several other reports of ITO transport performance having a maximum for small but nonzero oxygen partial pressure.

We have studied charge separation and transport in perovskite solar cells—which are the fundamental mechanisms of device operation and critical factors for power output—by determining the junction structure across the device using the nanoelectrical characterization technique of Kelvin probe force microscopy. Moreover, the distribution of electrical potential across both planar and porous devices demonstrates p–n junction structure at the TiO2/perovskite interfaces and minority-carrier diffusion/drift operation of the devices, rather than the operation mechanism of either an excitonic cell or a p-i-n structure.

"Combinatorial Reactive Sputtering of In2S3 as an Alternative Contact Layer for Thin Film Solar Cells","Siol, Sebastian; Dhakal, Tara P.; Gudavalli, Ganesh S.; Rajbhandari, Pravakar P.; DeHart, Clay; Baranowski, Lauryn L.; Zakutayev, Andriy","14 SOLAR ENERGY; 36 MATERIALS SCIENCE; In2S3 thin films; reactive sputtering; combinatorial device studies; buffer layer; CZTS; thin film solar cells; high throughput","High-throughput computational and experimental techniques have been used in the past to accelerate the discovery of new promising solar cell materials. An important part of the development of novel thin film solar cell technologies, that is still considered a bottleneck for both theory and experiment, is the search for alternative interfacial contact (buffer) layers. The research and development of contact materials is difficult due to the inherent complexity that arises from its interactions at the interface with the absorber. A promising alternative to the commonly used CdS buffer layer in thin film solar cells that contain absorbers with lower electron affinity can be found in ..beta..-In2S3. However, the synthesis conditions for the sputter deposition of this material are not well-established. Here, In2S3 is investigated as a solar cell contact material utilizing a high-throughput combinatorial screening of the temperature-flux parameter space, followed by a number of spatially resolved characterization techniques. It is demonstrated that, by tuning the sulfur partial pressure, phase pure ..beta..-In2S3 could be deposited using a broad range of substrate temperatures between 500 degrees C and ambient temperature. Combinatorial photovoltaic device libraries with Al/ZnO/In2S3/Cu2ZnSnS4/Mo/SiO2 structure were built at optimal processing conditions to investigate the feasibility of the sputtered In2S3 buffer layers and of an accelerated optimization of the device structure. The performance of the resulting In2S3/Cu2ZnSnS4 photovoltaic devices is on par with CdS/Cu2ZnSnS4 reference solar cells with similar values for short circuit currents and open circuit voltages, despite the overall quite low efficiency of the devices (-2%). Overall, these results demonstrate how a high-throughput experimental approach can be used to accelerate the development of contact materials and facilitate the optimization of thin film solar cell devices.","American Chemical Society","","National Renewable Energy Lab.

Using hybrid density-functional calculations, we present period-doubling reconstructions of a 90 degrees partial dislocation in GaAs, for which the periodicity of like-atom dimers along the dislocation line varies from one to two, to four dimers. The electronic properties of a dislocation change drastically with each period doubling. The dimers in the single-period dislocation are able to interact, to form a dispersive one-dimensional band with deep-gap states. However, the inter-dimer interaction for the double-period dislocation becomes significantly reduced; hence, it is free of mid-gap states. The Ga core undergoes a further period-doubling transition to a quadruple-period reconstruction induced by the formation of small hole polarons. In conclusion, the competition between these dislocation phases suggests a new passivation strategy via population manipulation of the detrimental single-period phase.","Nature Publishing Group Asia","","National Renewable Energy Lab.

In this study, we investigate the evolution of perovskites formed from targeted precursor chemistries by correlating in situ temperature-dependent X-ray diffraction, thermogravimetric analysis, and mass spectral analysis of the evolved species. This suite of analyses reveals important precursor composition-induced variations in the processes underpinning perovskite formation and degradation. The addition of Cl- leads to widely different precursor evolution and perovskite formation kinetics, and results in significant changes to the degradation mechanism, including suppression of crystalline PbI2 formation and modification of the thermal stability of the perovskite phase.

The example cell structure is ITO/n-TiO2/p-InP/Mo. For a benchmark scenario of 12% efficient modules, the module cost is estimated to be $0.66/W(DC) and the module cost is calculated to be around $0.36/W(DC) at a long-term potential efficiency of 24%. The manufacturing cost for the TF-VLS growth portion is estimated to be ~$23/m2, a significant reduction compared with traditional metalorganic chemical vapor deposition. The analysis here suggests the TF-VLS growth mode could enable lower-cost, high-efficiency III-V photovoltaics compared with manufacturing methods used today and open up possibilities for other optoelectronic applications as well.","Wiley","","National Renewable Energy Lab.

In addition to the internal structure of the NCs their assemblies can be tailored to achieve emergent properties and add additional control parameters that determine the final opto-electronic properties. These principles are explored via variations in shape, size, surface ligands, heterostructuring, morphology, composition, and assemblies and are demonstrated through measurements of excited state processes, such as Auger recombination; photoluminescence; charge separation and charge transport.","Elsevier","","National Renewable Energy Lab.

Semiconducting single-walled carbon nanotubes (SWCNTs) are strong near-infrared absorbers that form type-II heterojunctions with fullerenes such as C60. Although the efficiencies of SWCNT-fullerene OPV devices have climbed over the past few years, questions remain regarding the fundamental factors that currently limit their performance. In this study, we determine the exciton diffusion length in the C60 layer of SWCNT-C60 bilayer active layers using femtosecond transient absorption measurements. We demonstrate that hole transfer from photoexcited C60 molecules to SWCNTs can be tracked by the growth of narrow spectroscopic signatures of holes in the SWCNT 'reporter layer'. In bilayers with thick C60 layers, the SWCNT charge-related signatures display a slow rise over hundreds of picoseconds, reflecting exciton diffusion through the C60 layer to the interface. A model based on exciton diffusion with a Beer-Lambert excitation profile, as well as Monte Carlo simulations, gives the best fit to the data as a function of C60 layer thickness using an exciton diffusion length of approximately 5 nm.","American Chemical Society","","National Renewable Energy Lab.

A possible solution is to reuse the substrate many times, thus spreading its cost across many cells. We performed a bottom-up techno-economic analysis of three different strategies for substrate reuse in high-volume manufacturing: epitaxial lift-off, spalling, and the use of a porous germanium release layer. The analysis shows that the potential cost reduction resulting from substrate reuse is limited in all three strategies--not by the number of reuse cycles achievable, but by the costs that are incurred in each cycle to prepare the substrate for another epitaxial deposition. The dominant substrate-preparation cost component is different for each of the three strategies, and the cost-ranking of these strategies is subject to change if future developments substantially reduce the cost of epitaxial deposition.","Wiley","","National Renewable Energy Lab.

"Exceptional Morphology-Preserving Evolution of Formamidinium Lead Triiodide Perovskite Thin Films via Organic-Cation Displacement","Zhou, Yuanyuan; Yang, Mengjin; Pang, Shuping; Zhu, Kai; Padture, Nitin P.","14 SOLAR ENERGY; 36 MATERIALS SCIENCE; perovskite thin films; displacement; morphology","Here we demonstrate a radically different chemical route for the creation of HC(NH2)2PbI3 (FAPbI3) perovskite thin films. This approach entails a simple exposure of as-synthesized CH3NH3PbI3 (MAPbI3) perovskite thin films to HC(=NH)NH2 (formamidine or FA) gas at 150 degrees C, which leads to rapid displacement of the MA+ cations by FA+ cations in the perovskite structure. The resultant FAPbI3 perovskite thin films preserve the microstructural morphology of the original MAPbI3 thin films exceptionally well. Importantly, the myriad processing innovations that have led to the creation of high-quality MAPbI3 perovskite thin films are directly adaptable to FAPbI3 through this simple, rapid chemical-conversion route. Accordingly, we show that efficiencies of perovskite solar cells fabricated with FAPbI3 thin films created using this route can reach -18%.","American Chemical Society (ACS)","","National Renewable Energy Lab.

First, MBE GaN was grown on an amorphous substrate as a pre-orienting layer and its structural properties were investigated. Second, MOCVD grown GaN samples using the different growth techniques of planar and selective area growth (SAG) were comparatively investigated by transmission electron microscopy (TEM), cathodoluminescence (CL), and photoluminescence (PL). In MOCVD planar GaN, strong bound exciton peaks dominated despite the high density of the threading dislocations (TDs). In MOCVD SAG GaN, on the other hand, TDs were clearly reduced with bending, but basal stacking fault (BSF) PL peaks were observed at 3.42 eV. The combined epitaxial method not only provides a deep understanding of the growth behavior but also suggests an alternative approach for the growth of GaN on amorphous substances.","Japan Society of Applied Physics","","National Renewable Energy Lab.

"Phosphorus Diffusion Mechanisms and Deep Incorporation in Polycrystalline and Single-Crystalline CdTe","Colegrove, Eric; Harvey, Steven P.; Yang, Ji-Hui; Burst, James M.; Albin, David S.; Wei, Su-Huai; Metzger, Wyatt K.","14 SOLAR ENERGY; 36 MATERIALS SCIENCE; CdTe; diffusion; group V; grain boundary; polycrystalline; single crystal","A key challenge in cadmium telluride (CdTe) semiconductors is obtaining stable and high hole density. Group I elements substituting Cd can form ideal acceptors but easily self-compensate and diffuse quickly. For example, CdTe photovoltaics have relied on copper as a dopant, but copper creates stability problems and hole density that has not exceeded 1015 cm-3. If hole density can be increased beyond 10^16 cm-3, CdTe solar technology can exceed multicrystalline silicon and provide levelized costs of electricity below conventional energy sources. Group V elements substituting Te offer a solution, but are very difficult to incorporate. Using time-of-flight secondary-ion mass spectrometry, we examine bulk and grain boundary (GB) diffusion of phosphorous (P) in CdTe in Cd-rich conditions. We find that in addition to slow bulk diffusion and fast GB diffusion, there is a fast bulk diffusion component that enables deep P incorporation in CdTe. Detailed first-principles calculations indicate the slow bulk diffusion component is caused by substitutional P diffusion through the Te sublattice, whereas the fast bulk diffusion component is caused by P diffusing through interstitial lattice sites following the combination of a kick-out step and two rotation steps. The latter is limited in magnitude by high formation energy, but is sufficient to manipulate P incorporation. In addition to an increased physical understanding, this result opens up new experimental possibilities for Group V doping in CdTe materials.","American Physical Society","","National Renewable Energy Lab.

The purpose is to investigate the basic mechanisms involving the chemistry, morphology, and resulting particle adhesion to the first photon-incident surface. The evaluation and mapping of the chemistry and composition of single dust particles collected from operating PV module surfaces are presented. The first correlated direct measurements of the adhesive force of individual grains from field-operating collectors on identical PV module glass are reported, including correlations with specific compositions. Special microscale atomic force microscopy techniques are adapted to determine the force between the particle and the module glass surface. Results are presented for samples under dry and moisture-exposed conditions, confirming the effects of cementation for surfaces having soluble mineral and/or organic concentrations. Additionally, the effects of hydrocarbon fuels on the enhanced bonding of soiling particles to surfaces are determined for samples from urban and highly trafficked regions. Comparisons between glass and dust-mitigating superhydrophobic and superhydrophilic coatings are presented. Potential limitations of this proximal probe technique are discussed in terms of results and initial proof-of-concept experiments.","IEEE","","National Renewable Energy Lab.

Using a unique household-level survey dataset including 1234 adopters and 790 non-adopters from San Diego County, California, we explore differences in attitudinal and socio-economic factors for three groups: (i) adopters and non-adopters; (ii) early and more recent adopters; (iii) consumers adopting via buying or leasing. Our results suggest that adopters overall have higher incomes, are more educated, live in larger homes, and expect to stay in their homes for longer than their non-adopting peers. They also differ in their expectations of electricity retail rate changes and the impact solar could have on their home resale value. When examining differences between early and more recent adopters, we find that recent adopters are more representative of general homeowners and more politically moderate. They are also increasingly installing solar to protect against future electricity price increases and to lower electricity costs as opposed to adopting strictly for environmental reasons. Furthermore, more recent adopters differ significantly from earlier adopters in the situations that prompted them to adopt. Lastly, the findings demonstrate how solar markets are evolving, reflecting changes in the underlying drivers of consumer adoption as well as innovative solar marketing strategies.","IOP Publishing","","National Renewable Energy Lab.

"Adhesion and debonding kinetics of photovoltaic encapsulation in moist environments: Adhesion and debonding kinetics of photovoltaic encapsulation","Novoa, Fernando D.; Miller, David C.; Dauskardt, Reinhold H.","42 ENGINEERING; encapsulation debonding; interfacial adhesion; moisture; delamination; durability; 14 SOLAR ENERGY; 36 MATERIALS SCIENCE","Debonding of photovoltaic (PV) encapsulation in moist environments is frequently reported but presently not well understood or quantified. Temperature cycling, moisture, and mechanical loads often cause loss of encapsulation adhesion and interfacial debonding, initially facilitating back-reflectance and reduced electrical current, but ultimately leading to internal corrosion and loss of module functionality. To investigate the effects of temperature (T) and relative humidity (RH) on the kinetics of encapsulation debonding, we developed a mechanics-based technique to measure encapsulation debond energy and debond growth rates in a chamber of controlled environment. The debond energy decreased from 2.15 to 1.75 kJ m-2 in poly(ethylene-co-vinyl acetate) (EVA) and from 0.67 to 0.52 kJ m-2 in polyvinyl butyral when T increased from 25 to 50 degrees C and 20 to 40 degrees C, respectively. The debond growth rates of EVA increased up to 1000-fold with small increases of T (10 degrees C) and RH (15%). To elucidate the mechanisms of environmental debonding, we developed a fracture-kinetics model, where the viscoelastic relaxation processes at the debonding-tip are used to predict debond growth. The model and techniques constitute the fundamental basis for developing accelerated aging tests and long-term reliability predictions for PV encapsulation.","Wiley","","Stanford Univ., CA (United States); National Renewable Energy Lab.

Discrepancies in measured activity attributable to glassware and electrolyte impurity levels, as well as conditioning, protocols and corrections are prevalent in the literature. Moreover, the electrochemical response to a broad spectrum of commercially sourced perchloric acid and the effect of acid molarity on impurity levels and solution resistance were also assessed. Our findings reveal that an area specific activity (SA) exceeding 2.0 mA/cm<sup>2</sup> (20 mV/s, 25°C, 100 kPa, 0.1 M HClO<sub>4</sub>) for polished poly-Pt is an indicator of impurity levels that do not impede the accurate measurement of the ORR activity of Pt based catalysts. After exploring various conditioning protocols to approach maximum utilization of the electrochemical area (ECA) and peak ORR activity without introducing catalyst degradation, an investigation of measurement protocols for ECA and ORR activity was conducted. Down-selected protocols were based on the criteria of reproducibility, duration of experiments, impurity effects and magnitude of pseudo-capacitive background correction. In sum, statistical reproducibility of ORR activity for poly-Pt and Pt supported on high surface area carbon was demonstrated.","The Electrochemical Society","","National Renewable Energy Lab.

The Marcus formulation for electron transfer relates the thermodynamic driving force and reorganization energy for charge transfer between a given donor/acceptor pair to the kinetics and yield of electron transfer. Here we investigated the influence of the thermodynamic driving force for photoinduced electron transfer (PET) between single-walled carbon nanotubes (SWCNTs) and fullerene derivatives by employing time-resolved microwave conductivity as a sensitive probe of interfacial exciton dissociation. For the first time, we observed the Marcus inverted region (in which driving force exceeds reorganization energy) and quantified the reorganization energy for PET for a model SWCNT/acceptor system. The small reorganization energies (about 130 meV, most of which probably arises from the fullerene acceptors) are beneficial in minimizing energy loss in photoconversion schemes.","Nature Publishing Group","","National Renewable Energy Lab.

Band bending, charge density, and interface state density were extracted from the CV measurement using an analysis technique new to CIGS. The surface recombination velocity calculated from the density of interface traps for a ZnS/CIGS stack shows a remarkably low value of 810 cm/s, approaching the range of single crystalline II-VI systems. Both the PL spectra and its lifetime depend on the buffer layer; thus, these measurements are not only sensitive to the absorber but also to the absorber/buffer layer system. Pretreatment of the CIGS prior to the buffer layer deposition plays a significant role on the electrical properties for the same buffer layer/CIGS stack, further illuminating the importance of good interface formation.

"Impact of implanted phosphorus on the diffusivity of boron and its applicability to silicon solar cells","Schrof, Julian; Müller, Ralph; Reedy, Robert C.; Benick, Jan; Hermle, Martin","14 SOLAR ENERGY; 36 MATERIALS SCIENCE; silicon; furnaces; ion implantation; silicon doping; interstitial defects","In this work, boron diffusivity reduction in extrinsically doped silicon was investigated in the context of a process combination consisting of BBr<sub>3</sub> furnace diffusion and preceding Phosphorus ion implantation. The implantation of Phosphorus leads to a substantial blocking of Boron during the subsequent Boron diffusion. First, the influences of ion implantation induced point defects as well as the initial P doping on B diffusivity were studied independently. Here, it was found that not the defects created during ion implantation but the P doping itself results in the observed B diffusion retardation. The influence of the initial P concentration was investigated in more detail by varying the P implantation dose. A secondary ion mass spectrometry (SIMS) analysis of the BSG layer after the B diffusion revealed that the B diffusion retardation is not due to potential P content in the BSG layer but rather caused by the $n$-type doping of the crystalline silicon itself. Based on the observations the B diffusion retardation was classified into three groups: (i) no reduction of B diffusivity, (ii) reduced B diffusivity, and (iii) blocking of the B diffusion. The retardation of B diffusion can well be explained by the phosphorus doping level resulting in a Fermi level shift and pairing of B and P ions, both reducing the B diffusivity. Besides these main influences, there are probably additional transient phenomena responsible for the blocking of boron. Those might be an interstitial transport mechanism caused by P diffusion that reduces interstitial concentration at the surface or the silicon/BSG interface shift due to oxidation during the BBr3 diffusion process. Lifetime measurements revealed that the residual (non-blocked) B leads to an increased dark saturation current density in the P doped region. Nevertheless, electrical quality is on a high level and was further increased by reducing the B dose as well as by removing the first few nanometers of the silicon surface after the BBr<sub>3</sub> diffusion","American Institute of Physics (AIP)","","National Renewable Energy Lab.

In this work, we have systematically studied P and As doping in CdTe with first-principles calculations in order to understand how to increase the hole density. We find that both P and As p-type doping are self-compensated by the formation of AX centers. More importantly, we find that although high-temperature growth is beneficial to obtain high hole density, rapid cooling is necessary to sustain the hole density and to lower the Fermi level close to the valence band maximum (VBM) at room temperature. Thermodynamic simulations suggest that by cooling CdTe from a high growth temperature to room temperature under Te-poor conditions and choosing an optimal dopant concentration of about 10<sup>18</sup>/cm<sup>3</sup>, P and As doping can reach a hole density above 10<sup>17</sup>/cm<sup>3</sup> at room temperature and lower the Fermi level to within ~0.1 eV above the VBM.

We analyzed such simple diffuse rear reflectors systematically by optical and electrical measurements. We applied white paint, TiO<sub>2</sub> nanoparticles, white backsheets and a silver mirror to bifacial silicon solar cells and measured the enhancement of the external quantum efficiency for three different solar cell geometries: planar front and rear side, textured front and planar rear side, and textured front and rear side. We showed that an air-gap between the solar cell and the reflector decreases the absorption enhancement significantly, thus white paint and TiO<sub>2</sub> nanoparticles directly applied to the rear cell surface lead to the highest short circuit current density enhancements. Here, the short circuit current density gains for a 200 um thick planar solar cell reached up to 1.8 mA/cm<sup>2</sup>, compared to a non-reflecting black rear side and up to 0.8 mA/cm<sup>2</sup> compared to a high-quality silver mirror rear side. For solar cells with textured front side the short circuit current density gains are in the range between 0.5 and 1.0 mA/cm<sup>2</sup> compared to a non-reflecting black rear side and do not significantly depend on the angular characteristic of the rear side reflector but mainly on its absolute reflectance.","Elsevier","","National Renewable Energy Lab.

Although charge transport layers are used on either side of perovskite absorber layers to extract photogenerated electrons and holes, the time scales for charge extraction and recombination are poorly understood. Ideal charge transport layers should facilitate large discrepancies between charge extraction and recombination rates. Here, we demonstrate that highly enriched semiconducting single-walled carbon nanotube (SWCNT) films enable rapid (sub-picosecond) hole extraction from a prototypical perovskite absorber layer and extremely slow back-transfer and recombination (hundreds of microseconds). The energetically narrow and distinct spectroscopic signatures for charges within these SWCNT thin films enables the unambiguous temporal tracking of each charge carrier with time-resolved spectroscopies covering many decades of time. The efficient hole extraction by the SWCNT layer also improves electron extraction by the compact titanium dioxide electron transport layer, which should reduce charge accumulation at each critical interface. Finally, we demonstrate that the use of thin interface layers of semiconducting single-walled carbon nanotubes between the perovskite absorber layer and a prototypical hole transport layer improves device efficiency and stability, and reduces hysteresis.","Royal Society of Chemistry","","National Renewable Energy Lab.

In this work, we report a novel 3-D nanopatterning technique that combines ion-assisted aerosol lithography (IAAL) and soft lithography that serves as a facile method to fabricate 3-D nanostructures. Aerosol nanoparticles can be assembled into desired 3-D nanostructures via ion-induced electrostatic focusing and antenna effects from charged nanoparticle structures. Replication of the structures with a polymeric mold allows high throughput fabrication of 3-D nanostructures with various liquid-soluble materials. 3-D flower-patterned polydimethylsiloxane (PDMS) stamp was prepared using the reported technique and utilized for fabricating 3-D nanopatterned mesoporous TiO2 layer, which was employed as the electron transport layer in perovskite solar cells. By incorporating the 3-D nanostructures, absorbed photon-to-current efficiency of >95% at 650 nm wavelength and overall power conversion efficiency of 15.96% were achieved. The enhancement can be attributed to an increase in light harvesting efficiency in a broad wavelength range from 400 to 800 nm and more efficient charge collection from enlarged interfacial area between TiO2 and perovskite layers. This hybrid nanopatterning technique has demonstrated to be an effective method to create textures that increase light harvesting and charge collection with 3-D nanostructures in solar cells.","Elsevier","","National Renewable Energy Lab.

Thus, as a member of the copper chalcogenide group, Cu <sub>2-δ </sub> Te is expected to possess superior zTs because Te is less ionic and heavy. However, the zT value is low in the Cu<sub>2</sub>Te sintered using spark plasma sintering, which is typically used to fabricate high-density bulk samples. In addition, the extra sintering processes may change the samples’ compositions as well as their physical properties, especially for Cu<sub>2</sub>Te, which has many stable and meta-stable phases as well as weaker ionic bonding between Cu and Te as compared with Cu<sub>2</sub>S and Cu<sub>2</sub>Se. In this study, high-density Cu<sub>2</sub>Te samples were obtained using direct annealing without a sintering process. In the absence of sintering processes, the samples’ compositions could be well controlled, leading to substantially reduced carrier concentrations that are close to the optimal value. The electrical transports were optimized, and the thermal conductivity was considerably reduced. The zT values were significantly improved—to 1.1 at 1000 K—which is nearly 100% improvement. Furthermore, this method saves substantial time and cost during the sample’s growth. The study demonstrates that Cu <sub>2-δ </sub> X (X=S, Se and Te) is the only existing system to show high zTs in the series of compounds composed of three sequential primary group elements.","Nature Publishing Group Asia","","National Renewable Energy Lab.

Recently, it has been proposed that delocalization of the electronic states participating in charge transfer is crucial, and aggregated or otherwise locally ordered structures of the donor or the acceptor are the precondition for this electronic characteristic. The effect of intermolecular aggregation of both the polymer donor and fullerene acceptor on charge separation is studied. In the first case, the dilute electron acceptor triethylsilylhydroxy-1,4,8,11,15,18,22,25-octabutoxyphthalocyaninatosilicon(IV) (SiPc) is used to eliminate the influence of acceptor aggregation, and control polymer order through side-chain regioregularity, comparing charge generation in 96% regioregular (RR-) poly(3-hexylthiophene) (P3HT) with its regiorandom (RRa-) counterpart. In the second case, ordered phases in the polymer are eliminated by using RRa-P3HT, and phenyl-C61-butyric acid methyl ester (PC61BM) is used as the acceptor, varying its concentration to control aggregation. Time-resolved microwave conductivity, time-resolved photoluminescence, and transient absorption spectroscopy measurements show that while ultrafast charge transfer occurs in all samples, long-lived charge carriers are only produced in films with intermolecular aggregates of either RR-P3HT or PC61BM, and that polymer aggregates are just as effective in this regard as those of fullerenes.","Wiley","","National Renewable Energy Lab.

"Spatial Resolution Versus Data Acquisition Efficiency in Mapping an Inhomogeneous System with Species Diffusion","Chen, Fengxiang; Zhang, Yong; Gfroerer, T. H.; Finger, A. N.; Mark W. Wanlass","14 SOLAR ENERGY; semiconductors; optical spectroscopy","Traditionally, spatially-resolved photoluminescence (PL) has been performed using a point-by-point scan mode with both excitation and detection occurring at the same spatial location. But with the availability of high quality detector arrays like CCDs, an imaging mode has become popular for performing spatially-resolved PL. By illuminating the entire area of interest and collecting the data simultaneously from all spatial locations, the measurement efficiency can be greatly improved. However, this new approach has proceeded under the implicit assumption of comparable spatial resolution. We show here that when carrier diffusion is present, the spatial resolution can actually differ substantially between the two modes, with the less efficient scan mode being far superior. We apply both techniques in investigation of defects in a GaAs epilayer – where isolated singlet and doublet dislocations can be identified. A superposition principle is developed for solving the diffusion equation to extract the intrinsic carrier diffusion length, which can be applied to a system with arbitrarily distributed defects. The understanding derived from this work is significant for a broad range of problems in physics and beyond (for instance biology) – whenever the dynamics of generation, diffusion, and annihilation of species can be probed with either measurement mode.","Nature Publishing Group","","National Renewable Energy Lab.

We also describe the underlying materials science of graded buffers that enables metamorphic subcells with low dislocation densities.

To evaluate how PV's changing demand for silver might affect future silver prices, and the impact in terms of manufacturing costs, some scenarios of silver's contribution to c-Si PV cell manufacturing costs are compiled on the basis of projected changes in demand and price as a result of changes in material intensity. The analysis indicates that an expansion of c-Si production from 55GW/year to 250GW/year results in a 0.05-0.7 cent/W increase in manufacturing costs because of higher silver prices.","","","National Renewable Energy Lab.

For tandem photovoltaics using a Si bottom cell, as well as for other optoelectronic applications, there has been a longstanding need for optically active, wide band gap materials that can be integrated with Si. ZnSiP2 is a stable, wide band gap (2.1 eV) material that is lattice matched with silicon and comprised of inexpensive elements. As we show in this paper, it is also a defect-tolerant material. Here, we report the first ZnSiP2 photovoltaic device. We show that ZnSiP2 has excellent photoresponse and high open circuit voltage of 1.3 V, as measured in a photoelectrochemical configuration. The high voltage and low band gap-voltage offset are on par with much more mature wide band gap III-V materials.

ORR on smooth electrodes was strongly inhibited under specific conditions dependent on temperature, humidity, and scan rate. From the data presented, we postulate that dynamic changes in the molecular structure of the ionomer at the platinum interface result in differences in ORR voltammetry for films prepared and equilibrated under different conditions. The lack of similar changes for rough, platinized electrodes has been attributed to differences in initial ionomer structure and a higher energy barrier for ionomer restructuring. As a result, these model system studies yield insight into the ionomer-catalyst interface of particular interest for polymer electrolyte fuel cells.","The Electrochemical Society","","National Renewable Energy Lab.

Here we fabricate three-dimensional functional solid microstructures of reduced graphene oxide in a lyotropic nematic liquid crystal of graphene oxide flakes using a pulsed near-infrared laser. This reliable, scalable approach is mask-free, does not require special chemical reduction agents, and can be implemented at ambient conditions starting from aqueous graphene oxide flakes. Orientational ordering of graphene oxide flakes in self-assembled liquid-crystalline phases enables laser patterning of complex, three-dimensional reduced graphene oxide structures and colloidal particles, such as trefoil knots, with ‘frozen’ orientational order of flakes.

Based on the prediction that a tetrahedral polymorph of MnO should have such desirable semiconducting properties, and the possibility to overcome thermodynamic solubility limits by nonequilibrium thin-film growth, we exploit both structure-property and composition-structure relationships to design and realize novel wurtzite-structure Mn<sub>1₋x</sub>Zn<sub>x</sub>O alloys. At Zn compositions above x≈0.3, thin films of these alloys assume the tetrahedral wurtzite structure instead of the octahedral rocksalt structure of MnO, thereby enabling semiconductor properties that are unique among transition metal oxides, i.e., a band gap within the visible spectrum, a band-transport mechanism for both electron and hole carriers, electron doping, and a band lineup suitable for solar hydrogen generation. In conclusion, a proof of principle is provided by initial photo-electrocatalytic device measurements, corroborating, in particular, the predicted favorable hole-transport properties of these alloys.","American Physical Society","","National Renewable Energy Lab.

The subject has seen an increased interest in recent years resulting in more than 11 000 degradation rates in almost 200 studies from 40 different countries. As studies have grown in number and size, we found an impact from sampling bias attributable to size and accuracy. Because of the correlational nature of this study we examined the data in several ways to minimize this bias. We found median degradation for x-Si technologies in the 0.5-0.6%/year range with the mean in the 0.8-0.9%/year range. Hetero-interface technology (HIT) and microcrystalline silicon (..mu..c-Si) technologies, although not as plentiful, exhibit degradation around 1%/year and resemble thin-film products more closely than x-Si. Several studies showing low degradation for copper indium gallium selenide (CIGS) have emerged. Higher degradation for cadmium telluride (CdTe) has been reported, but these findings could reflect a convolution of less accurate studies and longer stabilization periods for some products. Significant deviations for beginning-of-life measurements with respect to nameplate rating have been documented over the last 35 years. Therefore, degradation rates that use nameplate rating as reference may be significantly impacted. Studies that used nameplate rating as reference but used solar simulators showed less variation than similar studies using outdoor measurements, even when accounting for different climates. This could be associated with confounding effects of measurement uncertainty and soiling that take place outdoors. Hotter climates and mounting configurations that lead to sustained higher temperatures may lead to higher degradation in some, but not all, products. Wear-out non-linearities for the worst performing modules have been documented in a few select studies that took multiple measurements of an ensemble of modules during the lifetime of the system. However, the majority of these modules exhibit a fairly linear decline. Modeling these non-linearities, whether they occur at the beginning-of-life or end-of-life in the PV life cycle, has an important impact on the levelized cost of energy.","Wiley","","National Renewable Energy Lab.

Thus, for a given injection temperature, the size of the PbS QD product is purely controlled by the amount of OA. We used this relationship to study PbS QD solar cells that are fabricated from the same size of PbS QDs but synthesized using four different injection temperatures: 95, 120, 150, and 185 °C.

However, this development of unexplored yet promising absorbers can be hindered by complications that arise during solar cell fabrication. Here, a high-throughput combinatorial method is applied to accelerate development of photovoltaic devices, in this case, using the novel CuSbS2 absorber via a newly developed three-stage self-regulated growth process to control absorber purity and orientation. Photovoltaic performance of the absorber, using the typical substrate CuInxGa1 - xSe2 (CIGS) device architecture, is explored as a function of absorber quality and thickness using a variety of back contacts. This study yields CuSbS2 device prototypes with ~1% conversion efficiency, suggesting that the optimal CuSbS2 device fabrication parameters and contact selection criteria are quite different than for CIGS, despite the similarity of these two absorbers. The CuSbS2 device efficiency is at present limited by low short-circuit current because of bulk recombination related to defects, and a small open-circuit voltage because of a theoretically predicted cliff-type conduction band offset between CuSbS2 and CdS. Overall, these results illustrate both the potential and limits of combinatorial methods to accelerate the development of thin film photovoltaic devices using novel absorbers.","Wiley","","National Renewable Energy Lab.

Upon thermal annealing, this acid layer oxidizes P3HT, creating a thin p-type interlayer of P3HT+/acid- on top of the BHJ. Using x-ray absorption spectroscopy, Kelvin probe and ellipsometry measurements, this P3HT+/acid- layer is shown to be insoluble in water, indicating it remains intact during the subsequent deposition of PEDOT:PSS.

"Effects of humidity during formation of zinc oxide electron contact layers from a diethylzinc precursor solution","Mauger, Scott A.; Steirer, K. Xerxes; Boe, Jonas; Ostrowski, David P.; Olson, Dana C.; Hammond, Scott R.","14 SOLAR ENERGY; 36 MATERIALS SCIENCE; organic photovoltaics; zinc oxide; processing; humidity; contact layer","Here, this work focuses on the role of humidity in the formation of ZnO thin films from a reactive diethylzinc precursor solution for use as the electron contact layer (ECL) in organic photovoltaic (OPV) devices. This method is well suited for flexible devices because the films are annealed at 120 °C, making the process compatible with polymer substrates. ZnO films were prepared by spin coating and annealing at different relative humidity (RH) levels. It is found that RH during coating and annealing affects the chemical and physical properties of the ZnO films. Using x-ray photoelectron spectroscopy it is found that increasing RH during the formation steps produces a more stoichiometric oxide and a higher Zn/O ratio. Spectroscopic ellipsometry data shows a small decrease in the optical band gap with increased humidity, consistent with a more stoichiometric oxide. Kelvin probe measurements show that increased RH during formation results in a larger work function (i.e. further from vacuum). Consistent with these data, but counter to what might be expected, when these ZnO films are used as ECLs in OPV devices those with ZnO ECLs processed in low RH (less stoichiometric) had higher power conversion efficiency than those with high-RH processed ZnO due to improved open-circuit voltage. The increase in open-circuit voltage with decreasing humidity was observed with two different donor polymers and fullerene acceptors, which shows the trend is due to changes in ZnO. The observed changes in open-circuit voltage follow the same trend as the ZnO work function indicating that the increase in open-circuit voltage with decreasing humidity is the result of improved energetics at the interface between the bulk-heterojunction and the ZnO layer due to a vacuum level shift.","Elsevier","","National Renewable Energy Lab.

The large pool of potential D and A units and the laborious processes of chemical synthesis and device optimization, has made progress on new high efficiency materials slow with a few new efficient copolymers reported every year despite the large number of groups pursuing these materials. In our paper we present an integrated approach toward new narrow bandgap copolymers that uses theory to guide the selection of materials to be synthesized based on their predicted energy levels, and time-resolved microwave conductivity (TRMC) to select the best-performing copolymer–fullerene bulk heterojunction to be incorporated into complete OPV devices. We validate our methodology by using a diverse group of 12 copolymers, including new and literature materials, to demonstrate good correlation between (a) theoretically determined energy levels of polymers and experimentally determined ionization energies and electron affinities and (b) photoconductance, measured by TRMC, and OPV device performance. The materials used here also allow us to explore whether further copolymer design rules need to be incorporated into our methodology for materials selection. For example, we explore the effect of the enthalpy change (ΔH) during exciton dissociation on the efficiency of free charge carrier generation and device efficiency and find that ΔH of -0.4 eV is sufficient for efficient charge generation.","Royal Society of Chemistry","","National Renewable Energy Lab.

Thus far, only single-component building blocks of colloids with connected surfaces have been studied, although topological colloids, with constituent particles shaped as freestanding knots and handlebodies of different genus, have been recently introduced. Here we develop a topological class of colloids shaped as multicomponent links. Using two-photon photopolymerization, we fabricate colloidal microparticle analogs of the classic examples of links studied in the field of topology, the Hopf and Solomon links, which we disperse in nematic fluids that possess orientational ordering of anisotropic rod-like molecules. The surfaces of these particles are treated to impose tangential or perpendicular boundary conditions for the alignment of liquid crystal molecules, so that they generate a host of topologically nontrivial field and defect structures in the dispersing nematic medium, resulting in an elastic coupling between the linked constituents. Here, the interplay between the topologies of surfaces of linked colloids and the molecular alignment field of the nematic host reveals that linking of particle rings with perpendicular boundary conditions is commonly accompanied by linking of closed singular defect loops, laying the foundations for fabricating complex composite materials with interlinking-based structural organization.","National Academy of Sciences","","National Renewable Energy Lab.

"High Temperature Performance of High-efficiency, Multi-layer Solar Selective Coatings for Tower Applications","Gray, M. H.; Tirawat, R.; Kessinger, K. A.; Ndione, P. F.","14 SOLAR ENERGY; 47 OTHER INSTRUMENTATION; concentrating solar power (CSP); CSP; high temperatures; coatings","The roadmap to next-generation concentrating solar power plants anticipates a progression to central towers with operating temperatures in excess of 650°C. These higher temperatures are required to drive higher power-cycle efficiencies, resulting in lower cost energy. However, these conditions also place a greater burden on the materials making up the receiver. Any novel absorber material developed for next-generation receivers must be stable in air, cost effective, and survive thousands of heating and cooling cycles. The collection efficiency of a power tower plant can be increased if the energy absorbed by the receiver is maximized while the heat loss from the receiver to the environment is minimized. Thermal radiation losses can be significant (>7% annual energy loss) with receivers at temperatures above 650°C. We present progress toward highly efficient and durable solar selective absorbers (SSAs) intended for operating temperatures from 650°C to 1000°C. Selective efficiency (η<sub>sel</sub>) is defined as the energy retained by the absorber, accounting for both absorptance and emittance, relative to the energy incident on the surface. The low emittance layers of multilayer SSAs are binary compounds of refractory metals whose material properties indicate that coatings formed of these materials should be oxidation resistant in air to 800-1200°C. On this basis, we initially developed a solar selective coating for parabolic troughs. This development has been successfully extended to meet the absorptance and emittance objectives for the more demanding, high temperature regime. We show advancement in coating materials, processing and designs resulting in the initial attainment of target efficiencies η<sub>sel</sub> > 0.91 for proposed tower conditions. Additionally, spectral measurements show that these coatings continue to perform at targeted levels after cycling to temperatures of 1000°C in environments of nitrogen and forming gas.","Elsevier","","National Renewable Energy Lab.

"Revealing the semiconductor–catalyst interface in buried platinum black silicon photocathodes","Aguiar, Jeffery A.; Anderson, Nicholas C.; Neale, Nathan R.","14 SOLAR ENERGY; 71 CLASSICAL AND QUANTUM MECHANICS, GENERAL PHYSICS; water splitting; photocatalysis","Nanoporous 'black' silicon semiconductors interfaced with buried platinum nanoparticle catalysts have exhibited stable activity for photoelectrochemical hydrogen evolution even after months of exposure to ambient conditions. The mechanism behind this stability has not been explained in detail, but is thought to involve a Pt/Si interface free from SiOx layer that would adversely affect interfacial charge transfer kinetics. In this paper, we resolve the chemical composition and structure of buried Pt/Si interfaces in black silicon photocathodes from a micron to sub-nanometer level using aberration corrected analytical scanning transmission electron microscopy. Through a controlled electrodeposition of copper on samples aged for one month in ambient conditions, we demonstrate that the main active catalytic sites are the buried Pt nanoparticles located below the 400-800 nm thick nanoporous SiOx layer. Though hydrogen production performance degrades over 100 h under photoelectrochemical operating conditions, this burying strategy preserves an atomically clean catalyst/Si interface free of oxide or other phases under air exposure and provides an example of a potential method for stabilizing silicon photoelectrodes from oxidative degradation in photoelectrochemical applications.","Royal Society of Chemistry","","National Renewable Energy Lab.

The maximum values of the third-order nonlinear susceptibility X(3) (-1.6 x 10-6 esu) are similar to or larger than many common third-order materials. The source of the nonlinearity is shown to be primarily excitonic in the tribromide film by virtue of its strong enhancement near the exciton resonance. Nonresonant excitation reduces the nonlinearity significantly, as does increasing the temperature. Substitution of one I for one Br also reduces the nonlinearity by at least one order of magnitude, presumably due to the lack of strong exciton resonance in the substituted form. The thin films are stable, highly homogenous (lacking significant light scattering), and simple and inexpensive to fabricate, making them potentially useful in a variety of optoelectronic applications in which wavelength selectivity is important.","Royal Society of Chemistry","","National Renewable Energy Lab.

Nitrides can have better solar absorption and electrical transport properties than the more widely studied oxides, as well as the potential for better scalability than other pnictides or chalcogenides. In addition, nitrides are also relatively unexplored compared to other chemistries, so they provide a great opportunity for new materials discovery. This paper reviews the recent advances in the design of novel semiconducting nitrides for solar energy conversion technologies. Both binary and multinary nitrides are discussed, with a range of metal chemistries (Cu3N, ZnSnN2, Sn3N4, etc.) and crystal structures (delafossite, perovskite, spinel, etc.), including a brief overview of wurtzite III-N materials and devices.

Thin films of methylammonium lead halide alloys (MAPbI3, MAPbBr3, MAPbBr2I, and MAPbBrI2), formamidinium lead halide alloys (FAPbI3, FAPbBr3, and FAPbBr2I), and formamidinium cesium lead halide alloys [FA0.85Cs0.15PbI3, FA0.85Cs0.15PbBrI2, and FA0.85Cs0.15Pb(Br0.4I0.6)3] were studied. The complex refractive index and dielectric functions were determined by spectroscopic ellipsometry (SE) in the photon energy range of 0.7-6.5 eV. Critical point energies and optical transitions were obtained by lineshape fitting to the second-derivative of the complex dielectric function data of these thin films as a function of alloy composition. Absorption onset in the vicinity of the bandgap, as well as critical point energies and optical band transition shift toward higher energies as the concentration of Br in the films increases. Cation alloying (Cs+) has less effect on the optical properties of the thin films compared to halide mixed alloys. The reported optical properties can help to understand the fundamental properties of the perovskite materials and also be used for optimizing or designing new devices.","Royal Society of Chemistry","","National Renewable Energy Lab.

Among the possible underlying reasons, ion self-diffusion has been inferred to play important roles. While theoretical studies congruously support that iodine is more mobile, experimental studies only observe the direct diffusion of the MA ion and possible diffusion of iodine. The discrepancy may result from the incomplete understanding of ion diffusion mechanisms. With the help of first-principles calculations, we studied ion diffusion in CH3NH3PbI3 (MAPbI3) through not only the vacancy-assisted mechanisms presumed in previous theoretical studies, but also the neglected interstiticaly mechanisms. We found that compared to the diffusion through the vacancy-assisted mechanism, MA ion diffusion through the interstiticaly mechanism has a much smaller barrier which could explain experimental observations. For iodine diffusion, both mechanisms can yield relatively small barriers. Depending on the growth conditions, defect densities of vacancies and interstitials can vary and so do the diffusion species as well as diffusion mechanisms. Our work thus supports that both MA and iodine ion diffusion could contribute to the performance instability of MAPbI3. While being congruous with experimental results, our work fills the research gap by providing a full understanding of ion diffusion in halide perovskites.","Royal Society of Chemistry","","National Renewable Energy Lab.

Diamond wire sawn Si wafers exhibit nearly-periodic surface features of different spatial wavelengths, which correspond to kinematics of various movements during wafering, such as ingot feed, wire reciprocation, and wire snap. The surface damage occurs in the form of frozen-in dislocations, phase changes, and microcracks. The in-depth damage was determined by conventional methods such as TEM, SEM and angle-polishing/defect-etching. However, because these methods only provide local information, we have also applied a new technique that determines average damage depth over a large area. This technique uses sequential measurement of the minority carrier lifetime after etching thin layers from the surfaces. The lateral spatial damage variations, which seem to be mainly related to wire reciprocation process, were observed by photoluminescence and minority carrier lifetime mapping. Our results show a strong correlation of damage depth on the diamond grit size and wire usage.","AIMS Press","","National Renewable Energy Lab.

Attaining high-quality lattice-mismatched (metamorphic) semiconductor devices is challenging. However, recent improvements to compositionally graded buffer epitaxy and junction structures have led to the achievement of high-quality metamorphic solar cells exhibiting internal luminescence efficiencies over 90%. For this high material quality, photon recycling is significant, and therefore, the optical environment of the solar cell becomes important. In this paper, we first present recent progress and performance results for 1- and 0.7-eV GaInAs solar cells grown on GaAs substrates. Then, an electrooptical model is used to assess the potential performance improvements in current metamorphic solar cells under different realizable design scenarios. The results show that the quality of 1-eV subcells is such that further improving its electronic quality does not produce significant Voc increases in the four-junction inverted metamorphic subcells, unless a back reflector is used to enhance photon recycling, which would significantly complicate the structure. Conversely, improving the electronic quality of the 0.7-eV subcell would lead to significant Voc boosts, driving the progress of four-junction inverted metamorphic solar cells.","IEEE","","National Renewable Energy Lab.

The effect of deposition parameters, such as pressure and substrate temperature, on the texture evolution has been established. It was found that the deposition temperature plays a dominant role in determining the preferred orientation whereas the ambient pressure (below 10 Torr) does not greatly affect the film texture. We further found that the microstrain changes from tensile at lower deposition temperatures to compressive at higher deposition temperatures. The preferred orientation also had a strong impact on the electrical resistivity of the films. The results provide guidance on the selection of substrate and deposition parameters to grow Zn3P2 thin films with desirable properties.","Springer","","National Renewable Energy Lab.

As the radiative efficiency of these individual cells increases, radiative coupling between the stacked cells becomes an increasingly important factor not only in cell design, but also in accurate efficiency measurement and in determining performance of cells and systems under varying spectral conditions in the field. Past modeling has concentrated on electroluminescent coupling between the cells, although photoluminescent coupling is shown to be important for cells operating near their maximum power point voltage or below or when junction defect recombination is significant. Extension of earlier models is proposed to allow this non-negligible component of luminescent coupling to be included. The refined model is validated by measurement of the closely related external emission from both single and double junction cells.","Elsevier","","National Renewable Energy Lab.

These devices are based on organic photodiodes with optically thick junctions. Paradoxically, we use broadband-absorbing organic semiconductors and utilize the electro-optical properties of the junction to create the narrowest NIR-band photoresponses yet demonstrated. In this context, these photodiodes outperform the encumbent technology (input filtered inorganic semiconductor diodes) and emerging technologies such as narrow absorber organic semiconductors or quantum nanocrystals. The design concept allows for response tuning and is generic for other spectral windows.

To understand its electronic structure and related fundamental optical properties, we perform first-principles calculations for three structural variations: kesterite, stannite, and primitive-mixed CuAu phases. The calculated data are compared with the room-temperature dielectric functionϵ=ϵ1+iϵ2 spectrum of polycrystalline Cu<sub>2</sub>ZnGeSe<sub>4</sub> determined by vacuum-ultraviolet spectroscopic ellipsometry in the photon-energy range of 0.7 to 9.0 eV.

A comparison of overall peak shapes and relative intensities between experimental spectra and the calculated ϵ data for three structural variations suggests that the sample may not have a pure (ordered) kesterite phase.

"The contamination mechanism and behavior of amide bond containing organic contaminant on PEMFC","Cho, Hyun -Seok; Das, Mayukhee; Wang, Heli; Dinh, Huyen N.; Van Zee, J. W.","14 SOLAR ENERGY; 77 NANOSCIENCE AND NANOTECHNOLOGY; caprolactam; absorption; organic contaminant; amide bond","In this paper, a study is presented of the effects of an organic contaminant containing an amide bond (-CONH-), ε-caprolactam, on polymer electrolyte membrane fuel cells (PEMFCs). The ε-caprolactam has been detected in leachates from polyphthalamide materials that are being considered for use as balance-of-plant structural materials for PEMFCs. Contamination effects from ε-caprolactam in Nafion membranes are shown to be controlled by temperature. A possible explanation of the temperature effect is the endothermic ring-opening reaction of the amide bond (-NHCO-) of the cyclic ε-caprolactam. UV-vis and ATR-IR spectroscopy studies confirmed the presence of open ring structure of ε-caprolactam in membranes. The ECSA and kinetic current for the ORR of the Pt/C catalyst were also investigated and were observed to decrease upon contamination by the ε-caprolactam. By comparison of the CVs of ammonia and acetic acid, we confirmed the adsorption of carboxylic acid (-COOH) or carboxylate anion (-COO-) onto the surface of the Pt. In conclusion, a comparison of in situ voltage losses at 80°C and 50°C also revealed temperature effects, especially in the membrane, as a result of the dramatic increase in the HFR.","The Electrochemical Society","","National Renewable Energy Lab.

AEMs require hydroxide stable covalently tetherable cations to ensure required conductivity. Benzyltrimethylammonium (BTMA) has been the covalently tetherable cation that has been most often employed in anion exchange membranes because it is reasonably basic, compact (limited number of atoms per charge), and easily/cheaply synthesized. Several reports exist that have investigated hydroxide stability of BTMA under specific conditions, but consistency within these reports and comparisons between them have not yet been made. While the hydroxide stability of BTMA has been believed to be a limitation for AEMs, this stability has not been thoroughly reported. In this paper, we have found that several methods reported have inherent flaws in their findings due to the difficulty of performing degradation experiments at high temperature and high pH. In order to address these shortcomings, we have developed a reliable, standardized method of determining cation degradation under conditions similar/relevant to those expected in electrochemical devices. The experimental method has been employed to determine BTMA stabilities at varying cation concentrations and elevated temperatures, and has resulted in improved experimental accuracy and reproducibility. Finally and most notably, these results have shown that BTMA is quite stable at 80°C (half-life of ~4 years), a significant increase in stability over what had been reported previously.","The Electrochemical Society","","National Renewable Energy Lab.

It has, therefore, become an attractive candidate for high-efficiency solar cells, perhaps becoming competitive with GaAs. The choice of substrate is a key design feature for epitaxial CdTe solar cells, and several possibilities (CdTe, Si, GaAs, and InSb) have been investigated by others. All have challenges, and these have generally been addressed through the addition of intermediate layers between the substrate and CdTe absorber. InSb is an attractive substrate choice for CdTe devices, because it has a close lattice match with CdTe, it has low resistivity, and it is easy to contact. However, the valence-band alignment between InSb and p-type CdTe, which can both impede hole current and enhance forward electron current, is not favorable. Three strategies to address the band-offset problem are investigated by numerical simulation: heavy doping of the back part of the CdTe layer, incorporation of an intermediate CdMgTe or CdZnTe layer, and the formation of an InSb tunnel junction. Lastly, wach of these strategies is predicted to be helpful for higher cell performance, but a combination of the first two should be most effective.","Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers","","National Renewable Energy Lab.

First, we study the effects of removing surface contaminants while maintaining a near-stoichiometric surface. Then we examine stoichiometric thermally reconstructed surfaces. Here, we also investigate the effects of shifting the surface stoichiometry by both “subtractive” (wet chemical etches) and “additive” (ampoule anneals and epitaxial growth) means. We consistently find for a variety of methods that a highly ordered stoichiometric to Cd-rich surface shows a significant reduction in surface recombination, whereas a Te-rich surface has high recombination and propose a mechanism to explain this. While as-received single crystals and as-deposited polycrystalline films have surface recombination velocities in the range of 10<sup>5</sup>–10<sup>6</sup> cm/s, we find that several routes can reduce surface recombination velocities to <2.5 × 10<sup>4</sup> cm/s.","American Institute of Physics (AIP)","","National Renewable Energy Lab.

"Microphase separation in thin films of lamellar forming polydisperse di-block copolymers","Kumar, Rajeev; Lokitz, Bradley S.; Sides, Scott W.; Chen, Jihua; Heller, William T.; Ankner, John F.; Browning, James F.; Kilbey II, S. Michael; Sumpter, Bobby G.","14 SOLAR ENERGY; 36 MATERIALS SCIENCE; microphase separation; thin films; polydispersity","Despite the ubiquity of polydispersity in chain lengths of di-block copolymers, its effects on microphase separation in thin films have eluded a clear understanding. In this work, we have studied effects of polydispersity on the microphase separation in thin films of lamellar forming di-block copolymers using self-consistent field theory (SCFT) and neutron reflectivity experiments. Di-block copolymers containing a polydisperse block of poly(glycidylmethacrylate) (PGMA) connected to a near-monodisperse block poly(2-vinyl-4,4-dimethyl-d6 azlactone) (PVDMA-d6) are considered in this work. Effects of chain length polydispersity, film thickness, substrate-monomer and monomer-monomer interactions on the microphase segregation are studied using SCFT. The theoretical study reveals that in comparison to a film created with monodisperse di-block copolymers, an increase in polydispersity tends to decrease the number of lamellar strata that can be packed in a film of given thickness. This is a direct consequence of an increase in lamellar domain spacing with an increase in polydispersity index. Furthermore, it is shown that polydispersity induces conformational asymmetry and an increase in the polydispersity index leads to an increase in the effective Kuhn segment length of the polydisperse blocks. It is shown that the conformational asymmetry effects, which are entropic in origin and of increasing importance as film thickness decreases, drive the polydisperse blocks to the middle of the films despite favorable substrate interactions. These predictions are verified by results from neutron reflectivity experiments on thin films made from moderately polydisperse PGMA-PVDMA-d6 di-block copolymer deposited on silicon substrates. Finally, results from SCFT are used to predict neutron reflectivity profiles, providing a facile and robust route to obtain useful physical insights into the structure of polydisperse diblock copolymers at interfaces.","Royal Society of Chemistry","","Oak Ridge National Lab.

T.","14 SOLAR ENERGY; 36 MATERIALS SCIENCE; silicon; band gap; x-ray diffraction; optical absorption; phototherma spectroscopy","Developing silicon nanoparticle (SiNP) synthesis techniques that allow for straightforward control of nanoparticle size and associated optical properties is critical to potential applications of these materials. In addition, it is, in general, hard to probe the absorption threshold in these materials due to silicon's low absorption coefficient. In this study, size is controlled through direct introduction of sulfur hexafluoride (SF<sub>6</sub>) into the dilute silane precursor of plasma synthesized SiNPs. Size reduction by nearly a factor of two with high crystallinity independent of size is demonstrated. Optical absorption spectra of the SiNPs in the vicinity of the bandgap are measured using photothermal deflection spectroscopy. Bandgap as a function of size is extracted taking into account the polydispersity of the samples. A systematic blue shift inabsorption edge due to quantum confinement in the SiNPs is observed with increasing flow of SF<sub>6</sub>. Photoluminescence (PL) spectra show a similar blue shift with size. However, a ~300 meV difference in energy between emission and absorption for all sizes suggests that PL emission involves a defect related process. While PL may allow size-induced shifts in the bandgap of SiNPs to be monitored, it cannot be relied on to give an accurate value for the bandgap as a function of size.","","","National Renewable Energy Lab.

This paper reports titanium dioxide (TiO<sub>2</sub>) pigment-based reflectors that have 2.5 times higher broadband diffuse reflection than commercially produced aluminum or silver based reflectors and result in efficiency enhancements of a single-junction amorphous Si solar cell. Electrophoretic deposition is used to produce pigment-based back reflectors with high pigment density, controllable film thickness and site-specific deposition. Electrical conductivity of the pigment-based back reflectors is improved by creating electrical vias throughout the pigment-based back reflector by making holes using an electrical discharge / dielectric breakdown approach followed by a second electrophoretic deposition of conductive nanoparticles into the holes. While previous studies have demonstrated the use of pigment-based back reflectors, for example white paint, on glass superstrate configured thin film Si solar cells, this work presents a scheme for producing pigment-based reflectors on complex shape and flexible substrates. Finally, mechanical durability and scalability are demonstrated on a continuous electrophoretic deposition roll-to-roll system which has flexible metal substrate capability of 4 inch wide and 300 feet long.","Optical Society of America (OSA)","","National Renewable Energy Lab.

In this study, CdTe-based cells produced in three independent laboratories using different device fabrication technologies are investigated before and after CdCl2 activation with regard to structural changes (recrystallisation and grain growth) and sulphur out-diffusion. Using scanning transmission electron microscopy (STEM) and x-ray diffraction it is demonstrated that CdCl2 activation of the investigated cells produces no statistical structural changes to the CdTe. Additionally, energy dispersive spectrometry (EDS) performed in the STEM on the same samples illustrates that the change in sulphur diffusion following activation is more limited than expected from previous studies; no change is detectable when the thermal budget for CdTe deposition is significantly greater than that for activation. This suggests that the efficiency enhancement during CdCl2 treatment is not due to sulphur out-diffusion. Lastly, cathodoluminescence microscopy is used to demonstrate in two dimensions how sulphur diffuses into a model sample and the results are found to be consistent with STEM-EDS. Some spectroscopic evidence for enhanced sulphur diffusion along grain boundaries is also observed.","Elsevier","","National Renewable Energy Lab.

We found that automated detection of series resistance increases can provide early warnings of some of the most common reliability issues, which also pose fire risks, including broken ribbons, broken solder bonds, and contact problems in the junction or combiner box.

Although triplet excitons are long-lived, their transport occurs through a Dexter transfer, making them slower than singlet excitons, which travel by means of a Förster mechanism. A thorough understanding of the interplay between singlet fission and exciton transport is therefore necessary to assess the potential and challenges of singlet-fission utilization. We report a direct visualization of exciton transport in single tetracene crystals using transient absorption microscopy with 200 fs time resolution and 50 nm spatial precision. Moreover, these measurements reveal a new singlet-mediated transport mechanism for triplets, which leads to an enhancement in effective triplet exciton diffusion of more than one order of magnitude on picosecond to nanosecond timescales. These results establish that there are optimal energetics of singlet and triplet excitons that benefit both singlet fission and exciton diffusion.","Nature Publishing Group","","National Renewable Energy Lab.

"Optimization of the antireflection coating of thin epitaxial crystalline silicon solar cells","Selj, Josefine K.; Young, David; Grover, Sachit","14 SOLAR ENERGY; 36 MATERIALS SCIENCE; antireflection coatings; epitaxial silicon solar cell","In this study we use an effective weighting function to include the internal quantum efficiency (IQE) and the effective thickness, Te, of the active cell layer in the optical modeling of the antireflection coating (ARC) of very thin crystalline silicon solar cells. The spectrum transmitted through the ARC is hence optimized for efficient use in the given cell structure and the solar cell performance can be improved. For a 2-μm thick crystalline silicon heterojunction solar cell the optimal thickness of the Indium Tin Oxide (ITO) ARC is reduced by ~8 nm when IQE data and effective thickness are taken into account compared to the standard ARC optimization, using the AM1.5 spectrum only. The reduced ARC thickness will shift the reflectance minima towards shorter wavelengths and hence better match the absorption of very thin cells, where the short wavelength range of the spectrum is relatively more important than the long, weakly absorbed wavelengths. For this cell, we find that the optimal thickness of the ITO starts at 63 nm for very thin (1 μm) active Si layer and then increase with increasing T<sub>e</sub> until it saturates at 71 nm for T<sub>e</sub> > 30 μm.","Elsevier","","National Renewable Energy Lab.

Following various standards from the International Organization for Standardization (ISO), the DNI definition is related to the irradiance from a small solid angle of the sky, centered on the position of the sun. Half-angle apertures of pyrheliometers measuring DNI have varied over time, up to ≈10°. The current recommendation of the World Meteorological Organization (WMO) for this half-angle is 2.5°. Solar concentrating collectors have an angular acceptance function that can be significantly narrower, especially for technologies with high concentration ratios. The disagreement between the various interpretations of DNI, from the theoretical definition used in atmospheric physics and radiative transfer modeling to practical definitions corresponding to specific measurements or conversion technologies is significant, especially in the presence of cirrus clouds or large concentration of aerosols. Under such sky conditions, the circumsolar radiation—i.e. the diffuse radiation coming from the vicinity of the sun—contributes significantly to the DNI ground measurement, although some concentrating collectors cannot utilize the bulk of it. These issues have been identified in the EU-funded projects MACC-II (Monitoring Atmospheric Composition and Climate-Interim Implementation) and SFERA (Solar Facilities for the European Research Area), and have been discussed within a panel of international experts in the framework of the Solar Heating and Cooling (SHC) program of the International Energy Agency’s (IEA’s) Task 46 “<i>Solar Resource Assessment and Forecasting</i>”. In accordance with these discussions, the terms of reference related to DNI are specified here. The important role of circumsolar radiation is evidenced, and its potential contribution is evaluated for typical atmospheric conditions. Thus, thorough analysis of performance of concentrating solar systems, it is recommended that, in addition to the conventional DNI related to 2.5° half-angle of today’s pyrheliometers, solar resource data sets also report the sunshape, the circumsolar contribution or the circumsolar ratio (CSR).","Elsevier","","National Renewable Energy Lab.

To date, a commonly employed approach to depolymerize the polysaccharides in plant cell walls employs mineral acids, and upgrading strategies for the resulting sugars are under intense development. Although the behavior of cellulose and hemicellulose is reasonably well characterized, a more thorough understanding of lignin depolymerization mechanisms in acid environments is necessary to predict the fate of lignin under such conditions and ultimately to potentially make lignin a viable feedstock. To this end, dilute acid hydrolysis experiments were performed on two lignin model compounds containing the a-O-4 ether linkage at two temperatures concomitant with dilute acid pretreatment. Both primary and secondary products were tracked over time, giving insight into the reaction kinetics. The only difference between the two model compounds was the presence or absence of a methyl group on the a-carbon, with the former being typical of native lignin. It was found that methylation of the a-carbon increases the rate of reaction by an order of magnitude. Density functional theory calculations were performed on a proposed mechanism initiated by a nucleophilic attack on the a-carbon by water with a commensurate protonation of the ether oxygen. The values for the thermodynamics and kinetics derived from these calculations were used as the basis for a microkinetic model of the reaction. Results from this model are in good agreement with the experimental kinetic data for both lignin model compounds and provide useful insight into the primary pathways of a-O-4 scission reactions in acid-catalyzed lignin depolymerization. The distribution of primary and secondary products is interpreted as a function of two barriers of formation exhibiting opposite trends upon methylation of the a-carbon (one barrier is lowered while the other is increased). Such insights will be needed to construct a comprehensive model of how lignin behaves in a common deconstruction approach.","American Chemical Society (ACS)","","National Renewable Energy Lab.

The optic (which we call a polychromat) was designed using a modified version of the direct-binary-search algorithm. The polychromat was fabricated using grayscale lithography. Rigorous optical characterization demonstrates excellent agreement with simulation results. Electrical characterization of the solar cells made from GaInP, GaAs and Si indicate increase in the peak output power density of 43.63%, 30.84% and 30.86%, respectively when compared to normal operation without the polychromat. This represents an overall increase of 35.52% in output power density. As a result, the potential for cost-effective large-area manufacturing and for high system efficiencies makes our approach a strong candidate for low cost solar power.","Optical Society of America (OSA)","","National Renewable Energy Lab.

The degree of the preferred orientation to the (004) plane of the anatase crystal structure has a strong dependency on the root-mean-square roughness (Sq) of the initial Ti substrate when the roughness-controlled substrates are anodized in an ethylene glycol-based electrolyte containing ~2 wt % of water. Highly preferred oriented NTAs were obtained from low-Sq (<10 nm) substrates, which were accompanied by uniform pore distribution and low concentration of hydroxyl ions in as-anodized amorphous NTAs. The mechanism of the preferred oriented crystallization of nanometer-scaled tube walls is explained considering the microscopic geometrical uniformity of the oxide barrier and nanopores at the early stage of anodization, which affected the local electric field and thus the insertion of the hydroxyl group into the amorphous TiO2 tube walls.","American Chemical Society","","National Renewable Energy Lab.

The novel high temperature SPR-based CSP system uses solid particles as the heat transfer medium (HTM) in place of the more conventional fluids such as molten salt or steam used in current state-of-the-art CSP plants. The solar particle receiver (SPR) is designed to heat the HTM to temperatures of 800 °C or higher which is well above the operating temperatures of nitrate-based molten salt thermal energy storage (TES) systems. The solid particles also help overcome some of the other challenges associated with molten salt-based systems such as freezing, instability and degradation. The higher operating temperatures and use of low cost HTM and higher efficiency power cycles are geared towards reducing costs associated with CSP systems. This paper describes the SPR-based CSP system with a focus on the fluidized-bed (FB) heat exchanger and its integration with various power cycles. Furthermore, the SPR technology provides a potential pathway to achieving the levelized cost of electricity (LCOE) target of $0.06/kWh that has been set by the U.S. Department of Energy's SunShot initiative.","Elsevier","","National Renewable Energy Lab.

In this paper, we evaluate their performance in solar cells by exploring the photovoltaic properties of Mott insulator LaVO3 (LVO). LVO films show an indirect band gap of 1.08 eV as well as strong light absorption over a wide wavelength range in the solar spectrum. First-principles calculations on the band structure of LVO further reveal that the d-d transitions within the upper and lower Mott-Hubbard bands and p-d transitions between the O 2p and V 3d band contribute to the absorption in visible and ultraviolet ranges, respectively. Transport measurements indicate strong carrier trapping and the formation of polarons in LVO. To utilize the strong light absorption of LVO and to overcome its poor carrier transport, we incorporate it as a light absorber in solar cells in conjunction with carrier transporters and evaluate its device performance. Our complementary experimental and theoretical results on such prototypical solar cells made of Mott-Hubbard transition-metal oxides pave the road for developing light-absorbing materials and photovoltaic devices based on strongly correlated electrons.","American Physical Society","","National Renewable Energy Lab.

"Development of a concentrating solar power system using fluidized-bed technology for thermal energy conversion and solid particles for thermal energy storage","Ma, Z.; Mehos, M.; Glatzmaier, G.; Sakadjian, B. B.","14 SOLAR ENERGY; 47 OTHER INSTRUMENTATION; concentrating solar power (CSP); solar receiver; heat transfer fluid; gas/solid two-phase flow","Concentrating solar power (CSP) is an effective way to convert solar energy into electricity with an economic energy-storage capability for grid-scale, dispatchable renewable power generation. However, CSP plants need to reduce costs to be competitive with other power generation methods. Two ways to reduce CSP cost are to increase solar-to-electric efficiency by supporting a high-efficiency power conversion system, and to use low-cost materials in the system. The current nitrate-based molten-salt systems have limited potential for cost reduction and improved power-conversion efficiency with high operating temperatures. Even with significant improvements in operating performance, these systems face challenges in satisfying the cost and performance targets. This paper introduces a novel CSP system with high-temperature capability that can be integrated into a high-efficiency CSP plant and that meets the low-cost, high-performance CSP targets. Unlike a conventional salt-based CSP plant, this design uses gas/solid, two-phase flow as the heat-transfer fluid (HTF); separated solid particles as storage media; and stable, inexpensive materials for the high-temperature receiver and energy storage containment. We highlight the economic and performance benefits of this innovative CSP system design, which has thermal energy storage capability for base-load power generation.","Elsevier","","National Renewable Energy Lab.

In recent years, photovoltaic industry has grown very rapidly. The installed capacity of PV for 2013 was about 37 GW and 2014 sales are expected to be around 45 GW. However, there has been excess production for last several years, which is responsible in part for the low prices (about 60 c/W). To lower the PV energy costs further, a major strategy appears to be going to high efficiency solar cells. This approach is favored (over lower cost/lower efficiency) because cell efficiency has a very large influence on the acceptable manufacturing cost of a PV module. Hence, the PV industry is moving toward developing processes and equipment to manufacture solar cells that can yield efficiencies >20%. Therefore, further research is needed within existing technologies to accomplish these objectives.

This method has been used to prove contract guarantees for over 700 MW of installed projects. The method is transparent, and the results are deterministic. In contrast, current industry practices incorporate statistical regression where the empirical coefficients may only characterize the collected data.

We combine the optimized dispatch from the dynamic program with estimated system loss of load probabilities to compute a probability distribution for the state of charge of storage in each period. This probability distribution can be used as a forced outage rate for storage in standard reliability-based capacity value estimation methods. Our proposed method has the advantage over existing approximations that it explicitly captures the effect of system shortage events on the state of charge of storage in subsequent periods.

Insertion of an ultrathin layer of poly(methylmethacrylate) (PMMA) between the bottom electrode and the PEDOT:PSS resulted in a systematic and substantial decrease in turn-on voltage, from 7.0 V to less than 1.0 V. An optimal thickness of the PMMA layer was found to yield the lowest consistent turn-on voltage of ~0.8 V, with 0.5 V being the lowest value of all fabricated devices. The switching mechanism was attributed to filamentary doping of the PEDOT:PSS. Insertion of the PMMA acted to protect the underlying ZnO from being etched by the acidic PEDOT:PSS as well as to improve its wetting properties. Moreover, devices were demonstrated on both ITO and aluminum bottom electrodes, with aluminum yielding the highest ON/OFF ratios in the study. Owing to their inverted architecture, the devices demonstrated good stability, and the retention time of the ON-state was determined to be greater than twenty months while stored in air for devices with ITO bottom electrodes.

In this work, we demonstrate the existence of drift transport in liquid electrolyte-based DSSCs using a thin Al<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub>-sheathed 3-dimentional (3-D) fluorinated tin oxide (FTO), as photoanodes. The electron diffusion rate in such 3-D TCO based DSSC exhibits a striking enhancement to the value of ~10<sup>–2</sup> cm<sup>2</sup>/s, about 10<sup>4</sup> times faster than that of the TiO<sub>2</sub> nanoparticle-based DSSCs.

"Evaluation of moisture ingress from the perimeter of photovoltaic modules: Evaluation of moisture ingress","Kempe, Michael D.; Dameron, Arrelaine A.; Reese, Matthew O.","14 SOLAR ENERGY; 36 MATERIALS SCIENCE; photovoltaic; edge-seal; moisture; humidity; polyisobutylene; desiccant; encapsulant","Many thin film photovoltaic (PV) technologies can be sensitive to corrosion induced by the presence of water vapor in the packaging materials. Typically impermeable front and backsheets are used in conjunction with an edge-seal around the perimeter to prevent water vapor ingress. These edge-seal materials are often made of a polyisobutylene resin filled with desiccant, which dramatically increases the time for moisture to reach sensitive module components. While edge-seals can prevent moisture ingress, even the lowest diffusivity transparent encapsulant materials are insufficient for the lifetime of a module. To evaluate the performance of edge-seal and encapsulant materials in a manner that simulates their function in a PV module, an optical method was devised where ingress is detected by reaction of a Ca film with water. Using this method, we have exposed test samples to heat and humidity allowing quantitative comparison of different edge-seal and encapsulant materials. Next, we use measurements of polymer diffusivity and solubility to evaluate the ability to model this moisture ingress. Here, we find good agreement between these two methods highlighting the much greater ability of polyisobutylene materials to keep moisture out as compared with typical encapsulant materials used in the PV industry.","Wiley","","National Renewable Energy Lab.

"Free Carrier Generation in Organic Photovoltaic Bulk Heterojunctions of Conjugated Polymers with Molecular Acceptors: Planar versus Spherical Acceptors","Nardes, Alexandre M.; Ferguson, Andrew J.; Wolfer, Pascal; Gui, Kurt; Burn, Paul L.; Meredith, Paul; Kopidakis, Nikos","14 SOLAR ENERGY; 37 INORGANIC, ORGANIC, PHYSICAL AND ANALYTICAL CHEMISTRY; 77 NANOSCIENCE AND NANOTECHNOLOGY; Chemical and Material Sciences; bulk heterojunctions; carrier transport; donor-acceptor systems; fullerenes; organic photovoltaics","We present a comparative study of the photophysical performance of the prototypical fullerene derivative PC61BM with a planar small-molecule acceptor in an organic photovoltaic device. The small-molecule planar acceptor is 2-[{7-(9,9-di-n-propyl-9H-fluoren-2-yl)benzo[c][1,2,5]thiadiazol-4-yl}methylene]malononitrile, termed K12. We discuss photoinduced free charge-carrier generation and transport in blends of PC61BM or K12 with poly(3-n-hexylthiophene) (P3HT), surveying literature results for P3HT:PC61BM and presenting new results on P3HT:K12. For both systems we also review previous work on film structure and correlate the structural and photophysical results. In both cases, a disordered mixed phase is formed between P3HT and the acceptor, although the photophysical properties of this mixed phase differ markedly for PC61BM and K12. In the case of PC61BM the mixed phase acts as a free carrier generation region that can efficiently shuttle carriers to the pure polymer and fullerene domains. As a result, the vast majority of excitons quenched in P3HT:PC61BM blends yield free carriers detected by the contactless time-resolved microwave conductivity (TRMC) method. In contrast, approximately 85 % of the excitons quenched in P3HT:K12 do not result in free carriers over the nanosecond timescale of the TRMC experiment. We attribute this to poor electron-transport properties in the mixed P3HT:K12 phase. Here, we propose that the observed differences can be traced to the respective shapes of PC61BM and K12: the three-dimensional nature of the fullerene cage facilitates coupling between PC61BM molecules irrespective of their relative orientation, whereas for K12 strong electronic coupling is only expected for molecules oriented with their π systems parallel to each other. Comparison between the eutectic compositions of the P3HT:PC61BM and P3HT:K12 shows that the former contains enough fullerene to form a percolation pathway for electrons, whereas the latter contains a sub-percolating volume fraction of the planar acceptor. Moreover, the planar K12 co-assembles with P3HT into a disordered, glassy phase that partly accounts for the poor electron-transport properties, and may also enhance recombination due to the strong intermolecular interactions between the donor and the acceptor. The implication for the performance of organic photovoltaic devices with the two acceptors is also discussed.","ChemPubSoc Europe","","National Renewable Energy Lab.

"Handling Large and Complex Data in a Photovoltaic Research Institution Using a Custom Laboratory Information Management System","White, Robert R.; Munch, Kristin","14 SOLAR ENERGY; 97 MATHEMATICS AND COMPUTING; Solar Energy; Photovoltaics","Twenty-five years ago the desktop computer started becoming ubiquitous in the scientific lab. Researchers were delighted with its ability to both control instrumentation and acquire data on a single system, but they were not completely satisfied. There were often gaps in knowledge that they thought might be gained if they just had more data and they could get the data faster. Computer technology has evolved in keeping with Moore’s Law meeting those desires; however those improvements have of late become both a boon and bane for researchers. Computers are now capable of producing high speed data streams containing terabytes of information; capabilities that evolved faster than envisioned last century. Software to handle large scientific data sets has not kept up. How much information might be lost through accidental mismanagement or how many discoveries are missed through data overload are now vital questions. An important new task in most scientific disciplines involves developing methods to address those issues and to create the software that can handle large data sets with an eye towards scalability. This software must create archived, indexed, and searchable data from heterogeneous instrumentation for the implementation of a strong data-driven materials development strategy. At the National Center for Photovoltaics in the National Renewable Energy Laboratory, we began development a few years ago on a Laboratory Information Management System (LIMS) designed to handle lab-wide scientific data acquisition, management, processing and mining needs for physics and materials science data, and with a specific focus towards future scalability for new equipment or research focuses. We will present the decisions, processes, and problems we went through while building our LIMS system for materials research, its current operational state and our steps for future development.","Materials Research Society (MRS)","","National Renewable Energy Lab.

It employs first-principle optical treatment of collector optical error sources and derives analytical mathematical formulae to calculate the intercept factor of a trough collector. A suite of MATLAB code is developed for FirstOPTIC and validated against theoretical/numerical solutions and ray-tracing results. It is shown that FirstOPTIC can provide fast and accurate calculation of intercept factors of trough collectors. The method makes it possible to carry out fast evaluation of trough collectors for design purposes. The FirstOPTIC techniques and analysis may be naturally extended to other types of CSP technologies such as linear-Fresnel collectors and central-receiver towers.","","","National Renewable Energy Lab.

Changes in transmittance with time in the field affect module performance, which may impact product warranties. Transmittance is important in product development, module manufacturing, and field power production (both immediate and long-term). Therefore, an international standard (IEC 62788-1-4) has recently been proposed by the Encapsulation Task-Group within the Working Group 2 (WG2) of the International Electrotechnical Commission (IEC) Technical Committee 82 (TC82) for the quantification of the optical performance of PV encapsulation materials. Existing standards, such as ASTM E903, are general and more appropriately applied to concentrated solar power than to PV. Starting from the optical transmittance measurement, the solar-weighted transmittance of photon irradiance, yellowness index (which may be used in aging studies to assess durability), and ultraviolet (UV) cut-off wavelength may all be determined using the proposed standard. The details of the proposed test are described. The results of a round-robin experiment (for five materials) conducted at seven laboratories to validate the test procedure using representative materials are also presented. For example, the Encapsulation Group actively explored the measurement requirements (wavelength range and resolution), the requirements for the spectrophotometer (including the integrating sphere and instrument accessories, such as a depolarizer), specimen requirements (choice of glass-superstrate and -substrate), and data analysis (relative to the light that may be used in the PV application). The round-robin experiment identified both intra- and inter-laboratory instrument precision and bias for five encapsulation materials (encompassing a range of transmittance and haze-formation characteristics).","SPIE","","National Renewable Energy Lab.

In this study, the crosshatch roughness during growth of a compressive GaInP/GaAs graded buffer is reduced by increasing the phosphine partial pressure throughout the metamorphic growth. Changes in the average misfit dislocation length are qualitatively determined by characterizing the threading defect density and residual strain. The decrease of crosshatch roughness leads to an increase in the average misfit dislocation glide length, indicating that the surface roughness is limiting dislocation glide. Growth rate is also analyzed as a method to reduce surface crosshatch roughness and increase glide length, but has a more complicated relationship with glide kinetics. Using knowledge gained from these experiments, high quality inverted GaInAs 1 eV solar cells are grown on a GaInP compositionally graded buffer with reduced roughness and threading dislocation density. The open circuit voltage is only 0.38 V lower than the bandgap potential at a short circuit current density of 15 mA/cm{sup 2}, suggesting that there is very little loss due to the lattice mismatch.","","","National Renewable Energy Lab.

InAs/GaAsSb samples with 13% and 15% Sb compositions show distinct differences in emission spectra as the PL excitation power increases. Whilst no discernible shift is seen for the 13% sample, a blue-shift of PL spectra following a 1/3 exponent of the excitation power is observed for the 15% sample suggesting a transition from a type I to type II band alignment. Time-resolved PL data show a significant increase in carrier lifetime as the Sb composition increases between 13% and 15% implying that the transformation from a type I to type II band alignment occurs between 13% and 15% Sb compositions. These results taken together lead to the conclusion that a zero valence band offset (VBO) can be achieved for the InAs/GaAsSb system in the vicinity of 14% Sb composition.","","","National Renewable Energy Lab.

By confining film thicknesses to the range 500-4000 {angstrom}, optical microscopy in the reflection mode can be used to readily detect crystallites in the thermally annealed a-Si:H lattice. Measurements of the crystallite density versus annealing time for identically prepared films of different thickness show that the crystallite nucleation rate is smaller for thinner films, suggesting that crystallite nucleation is homogeneous, in agreement with previous results. A comparison of film nucleation rates with those obtained by other methods on identically prepared films shows excellent agreement, thus establishing the validity of the current technique. The potential effect of impurity (oxygen) incorporation during the stepwise annealing in air is shown not to affect crystallite nucleation and growth, in that SIMS oxygen profiles for stepwise versus continuous annealing show not only similar impurity profiles but also similar bulk impurity densities.","","","National Renewable Energy Lab.

Modified electrodes by these two methods have been examined for light induced water oxidation and compared to the unmodified SiO{sub 2}-BiVO{sub 4} electrodes by various photoelectrochemical techniques. The PED method was a more effective method of OEC preparation than the ED method as evidenced by an increased photocurrent magnitude during photocurrent-potential (I-V) characterizations. Electrode surfaces catalyzed by PED exhibited a very large cathodic shift (420 mV) in the onset potential for water oxidation.

We found that Ag screen-printing metallization fired at the over-fire temperature significantly degrades the junction uniformity beneath the Ag contact grid, whereas metallization at the optimal- and under-fire temperatures does not cause degradation. Ag crystallites with widely distributed sizes were found at the Ag-grid/emitter-Si interface of the over-fired cell, which is associated with the junction damage beneath the Ag grid. Large crystallites protrude into Si deeper than the junction depth. However, the junction was not broken down; instead, it was reformed on the entire front of the crystallite/Si interface. We propose a mechanism of junction-quality degradation, based on emitter Si melting at the temperature around the Ag-Si eutectic point during firing, and subsequent re-crystallization with incorporation of Ag and other impurities and with formation of crystallographic defects during quenching. The effect of this junction damage on solar cell performance is discussed.","","","National Renewable Energy Lab.

Prior to harmonization, the median of 42 estimates of life cycle GHG emissions from those 13 LCAs was 57 grams carbon dioxide equivalent per kilowatt-hour (g CO{sub 2}-eq/kWh), with an interquartile range (IQR) of 44 to 73. After harmonizing key performance characteristics, irradiation of 1,700 kilowatt-hours per square meter per year (kWh/m{sup 2}/yr); system lifetime of 30 years; module efficiency of 13.2% or 14.0%, depending on module type; and a performance ratio of 0.75 or 0.80, depending on installation, the median estimate decreased to 45 and the IQR tightened to 39 to 49. The median estimate and variability were reduced compared to published estimates mainly because of higher average assumptions for irradiation and system lifetime. For the sample of studies evaluated, harmonization effectively reduced variability, providing a clearer synopsis of the life cycle GHG emissions from c-Si PVs. The literature used in this harmonization neither covers all possible c-Si installations nor represents the distribution of deployed or manufactured c-Si PVs.","","","National Renewable Energy Lab.

We find that the charge-compensated co-alloying results in the following effects: (1) It enhances the solubility of Mg and Ti, which leads to reduced electron effective mass and therefore increased electron mobility; (2) It tunes the carrier density and therefore allows the optimization of electrical conductivity; and (3) It reduces the density of charged defects and therefore reduces carrier recombination. As a result, the Ti and Mg co-alloyed hematite thin films exhibit improved water oxidation photocurrent magnitudes as compared to pure hematite thin films. Our results suggest that charge-compensated co-alloying is a plausible approach for engineering hematite for the application of PEC water splitting.","","","National Renewable Energy Lab.

From 125 references reviewed, 10 produced 36 independent GHG emissions estimates passing screens for quality and relevance: 19 for parabolic trough (trough) technology and 17 for power tower (tower) technology. The interquartile range (IQR) of published estimates for troughs and towers were 83 and 20 grams of carbon dioxide equivalent per kilowatt-hour (g CO2-eq/kWh),1 respectively; median estimates were 26 and 38 g CO2-eq/kWh for trough and tower, respectively. Two levels of harmonization were applied. Light harmonization reduced variability in published estimates by using consistent values for key parameters pertaining to plant design and performance. The IQR and median were reduced by 87% and 17%, respectively, for troughs. For towers, the IQR and median decreased by 33% and 38%, respectively. Next, five trough LCAs reporting detailed life cycle inventories were identified. The variability and central tendency of their estimates are reduced by 91% and 81%, respectively, after light harmonization. By harmonizing these five estimates to consistent values for global warming intensities of materials and expanding system boundaries to consistently include electricity and auxiliary natural gas combustion, variability is reduced by an additional 32% while central tendency increases by 8%. These harmonized values provide useful starting points for policy makers in evaluating life cycle GHG emissions from CSP projects without the requirement to conduct a full LCA for each new project.","","","National Renewable Energy Lab.

Whether such medium-range order (MRO) can exist in materials at well above their melting or glass-transition temperature has been a long-standing important scientific issue. Here, using ab initio molecular dynamics simulations, we show that a novel, persistent MRO exists in liquid Al-Cu alloys near the composition of CuAl{sub 3}. The correlated atomic motions associated with the MRO give rise to a substantially enhanced viscosity in the vicinity of the composition. The component of the MRO liquid state gradually decreases with increasing temperature, and it disappears above a crossover temperature T{sub LLC}. The continuous liquid-liquid crossover through a percolationlike transition leads to a pronounced heat capacity peak at T{sub LLC}.","","","National Renewable Energy Lab.

The proposed tandem solar cell is comprised of a III-nitride top cell bonded to a non-III-nitride, series-constrained, multi-junction subcell. The top cell is electrically isolated, but optically coupled to the underlying subcell. The use of a III-nitride top cell is potentially beneficial when the top junction of a stand-alone non-III-nitride subcell generates more photocurrent than the limiting current of the non-III-nitride subcell. Light producing this excess current can either be redirected to the III-nitride top cell through high energy photon absorption, redirected to the lower junctions through layer thickness optimization, or a combination of both, resulting in improved total efficiency. When the non-III-nitride cell's top junction is the limiting junction, the minimum power conversion efficiency that the III-nitride top cell must contribute should compensate for the spectrum filtered from the multi-junction subcell for this design to be useful. As the III-nitride absorption edge wavelength, {lambda}{sub N}, increases, the performance of the multi-junction subcell decreases due to spectral filtering. In the most common spectra of interest (AM1.5G, AM1.5 D, and AM0), the technology to grow InGaN cells with {lambda}{sub N}&lt;520 nm is found to be sufficient for III-nitride top cell applications. The external quantum efficiency performance, however, of state-of-the-art InGaN solar cells still needs to be improved. The effects of surface/interface reflections are also presented. The management of these reflection issues determines the feasibility of the integrated III-nitride/non-III-nitride design to improve overall cell efficiency.","","","National Renewable Energy Lab.

LSSCPV can concentrate available sunlight and laterally split a single beam into bands with different spectra for absorption by different solar cells with band gaps matched to the split spectrum. Test assemblies of a sample LSSCPV architecture were constructed, each of which contains four p-n junctions and two optical pieces. Independent experiments or simulations had been implemented on the components but by using optimal assumptions. In order to examine the actual performances of all the components, which are dependent on each other and the light source, direct outdoor measurements were made. A set of self-consistent efficiency definitions was articulated and a test bed was developed to measure the parameters required by the efficiency calculation. By comparing the component efficiency items derived from the outdoor measurement and the expected values based on independent simulations, the potential opportunities for efficiency improvement are determined. In the outdoor measurement at the University of Delaware, the optical component demonstrated 89.1% efficiency. Additional assemblies were tested at the National Renewable Energy Laboratory. One assembly demonstrated 36.7% submodule efficiency, which compares favorably with the 32.6% previously reported verified submodule efficiency.","","","National Renewable Energy Lab.

Thermogravimetric analysis indicates complete decomposition of the metal-organic precursor by 115 C in air. Acetonitrile solutions spin-cast in a N{sub 2} atmosphere and annealed in air yield continuous thin films of MoO{sub x}. Ultraviolet, inverse, and X-ray photoemission spectroscopies confirm the formation of MoO{sub x} and, along with Kelvin probe measurements, provide detailed information about the energetics of the MoO{sub x} thin films. Incorporation of these films into conventional architecture bulk heterojunction OPV devices with poly(3-hexylthiophene) and [6,6]-phenyl-C{sub 61} butyric acid methyl ester afford comparable power conversion efficiencies to those obtained with the industry-standard material for hole injection and collection: poly(3,4-ethylenedioxythiophene):poly(styrene sulfonate) (PEDOT:PSS). The MoO{sub x} HCL devices exhibit slightly reduced open circuit voltages and short circuit current densities with respect to the PEDOT:PSS HCL devices, likely due in part to charge recombination at Mo{sup 5+} gap states in the MoO{sub x} HCL, and demonstrate enhanced fill factors due to reduced series resistance in the MoO{sub x} HCL.","","","National Renewable Energy Lab.

Here we offer a calculable selection metric of 'spectroscopic limited maximum efficiency (SLME)' that can be used for initial screening based on intrinsic properties alone. It takes into account the band gap, the shape of absorption spectra, and the material-dependent nonradiative recombination losses. This is illustrated here via high-throughput first-principles quasiparticle calculations of SLME for {approx}260 generalized I{sub p}III{sub q}VI{sub r} chalcopyrite materials.

The lifetime degradation of the most heavily contaminated samples was caused by Ni silicide precipitates at the surface of the wafers. The impact on lifetime was determined by surface recombination velocities (SRV). SRV values from RCPCD were comparable to those extracted by the QSSPC technique. A direct correlation between minority carrier lifetime and the concentration of electrically active substitutional Ni and Ni silicide precipitate traps measured using deep level transient spectroscopy was established.","","","National Renewable Energy Lab.

The effective mass of minority carrier ranges from 0.5 m{sub 0} perpendicular to the van der Waals layers to 0.2 m{sub 0} into the van der Waals layers.

Applying (i) traditional small polaron analysis to our in-situ high temperature four-point conductivity and thermopower measurements, we previously found an activated mobility, which is indicative of the small polaron mechanism. However, (ii) employing the recent developments in correcting density functional methodologies for hole localization, we predict that the self-trapped hole is unstable and that Rh{sub 2}ZnO{sub 4} is instead a band conductor with a large effective mass. The hole mobility measured by high-field room temperature Hall effect also suggests band rather than polaron conduction. The apparent contradiction between the conclusion of the traditional procedure (i) and first-principles theory (ii) is resolved by taking into account in the previous transport analysis the temperature dependence of the effective density of states, which leads to the result that the mobility is actually temperature-independent in Rh{sub 2}ZnO{sub 4}. Our case study on Rh{sub 2}ZnO{sub 4} illustrates the range of experimental and theoretical approaches at hand to determine whether the transport mechanism of a semiconductor is band or small polaron conduction.","","","National Renewable Energy Lab.

Rebate applications in California require results from the CEC PV model, and thus depend on an up-to-date database of module characteristics. Currently, adding new modules to the database requires calculating operational coefficients using a general purpose equation solver - a cumbersome process for the 300+ modules added on average every month. The combination of empirical regressions and heuristic methods presented herein achieve automated convergence for 99.87% of the 5487 modules in the CEC database and greatly enhance the accuracy and efficiency by which new modules can be characterized and approved for use. The added robustness also permits general purpose use of the CEC/6 parameter module model by modelers and system analysts when standard module specifications are known, even if the module does not exist in a preprocessed database.","","","National Renewable Energy Lab.

These misfitdislocations provide excellent strain relief. However, in their unreconstructed form the dislocation contains numerous high-energy N dangling bonds, which must be eliminated by reconstructing the dislocation core. Existing single-period (SP) and double-period (DP) dislocation reconstruction models eliminate these dangling bonds via a like-atom dimerization, such as N-N dimers. However, we show that these N-N dimers are unstable for the III-N materials, so an entirely new reconstruction mechanism is needed. A 'triple-period' (TP) structural model is developed which eliminates N dangling bonds via the formation of N vacancies instead of N-N dimers. The model contains no N-N (or III-III) bonds, fully bonds all N atoms to four group-III neighboring atoms, and satisfies the 'electron counting rule' by transferring charge from In dangling bonds to Ga dangling bonds.","","","National Renewable Energy Lab.

The thermal efficiency can be determined by testing the collector under actual operating conditions or by separately measuring these two components. This paper describes how outdoor measurement of the optical efficiency is combined with laboratory measurements of receiver heat loss to obtain the thermal efficiency curve. This paper describes this approach and also makes the case that there are advantages to plotting collector efficiency versus the difference between the operating temperature and the ambient temperature at which the receiver heat loss was measured divided by radiation to a fractional power (on the order of 1/3 but obtained via data regression) - as opposed to the difference between operating and ambient temperatures divided by the radiation. The results are shown to be robust over wide ranges of ambient temperature, sky temperature, and wind speed.","","","National Renewable Energy Lab.

Understanding and improving the incorporation of boron in GaAs is an important first step toward the realization of these strain-balanced systems. Here, we show that the apparent boron incorporation in GaAs, determined from X-ray diffraction measurements, decreases as the substrate temperature is increased, although measurements of the metallurgical concentration of boron remain constant. This implies that boron is incorporating preferentially on non-substitutional sites as growth temperature is increased. The addition of a bismuth surfactant flux not only makes the epilayers smoother, but within a narrow range of substrate temperatures, restores the incorporation of substitutional boron.","","","National Renewable Energy Lab.

Sorghum [Sorghum bicolor (L.) Moench] is one such crop that will be an important feedstock source for biofuel production. As composition influences productivity, there exists a need to understand the range in composition observed within the crop. The goal of this research was to assess the range in dietary fiber composition observed within different types of biomass sorghums. A total of 152 sorghum samples were divided into the four end-use types of sorghum: biomass, forage, sorghum-sudangrass, and sweet. These samples were analyzed chemically using dietary fiber analysis performed at the National Renewable Energy Laboratory using published protocols. Significant variation among the groups was detected for glucan and ash. Positive and highly significant correlations were detected between structural carbohydrates in the biomass and sweet sorghums while many of these correlations were negative or not significant in the forage and sorghum-sudangrass types.

The surface chemistry of GZO is complex and dominated by the hydrolysis chemistry of ZnO, which influences the work function via charge transfer and band bending caused by adsorbates. A comprehensive characterization of the surface chemical composition and electrochemical properties of GZO electrodes is presented, using both solution and surface adsorbed redox probe molecules. The GZO surface is characterized using monochromatic X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy and ultraviolet photoelectron spectroscopy after the following pretreatments: (i) hydriodic acid etch, (ii) potassium hydroxide etch, (iii) RF oxygen plasma etching, and (iv) high-vacuum argon-ion sputtering. The O 1s spectra for the GZO electrodes have contributions from the stoichiometric oxide lattice, defects within the lattice, hydroxylated species, and carbonaceous impurities, with relative near-surface compositions varying with pretreatment. Solution etching procedures result in an increase of the work function and ionization potential of the GZO electrode, but yield different near surface Zn:Ga atomic ratios, which significantly influence charge transfer rates for a chemisorbed probe molecule. The near surface chemical composition is shown to be the dominant factor in controlling surface work function and significantly influences the rate of electron transfer to both solution and tethered probe molecules.","","","National Renewable Energy Lab.

Aside from having desirable quantum confinement properties, colloidal nanocrystals are attractive because they are often synthesized in low-temperature, low-cost, and potentially scalable manners using simple benchtop reaction baths. Considerable progress in producing a variety of shapes, compositions, and complex structures has been achieved. However, there are challenges to overcome in order for these novel materials to reach their full potential and become new drivers for commercial applications. The final shape, composition, nanocrystal-ligand structure, and size can depend on a delicate interplay of precursors, surface ligands, and other compounds that may or may not participate in the reaction.

We attribute the dark spots to crystal dislocations, where nonradiative recombination is augmented by transitions utilizing defect-related energy levels between the conduction and valence bands. We note that, when the laser excitation intensity is reduced, the darkened regions expand. At lower excitation, the density of photogenerated electrons and holes is reduced, and they are more likely to reach the defective region before encountering a partner for radiative recombination. When we model the behavior with a simulation that allows for Laplacian diffusion and defect-related recombination only through mid-bandgap energy levels, we do not obtain good agreement between experimental and simulated images. But if we allow for an arbitrary distribution of defect levels, such that the occupation of the levels and bands can change independently, we have more flexibility for fitting the density-dependent recombination rates. The more sophisticated model produces results that are more consistent with experimental images.","","","National Renewable Energy Lab.

When backed by energy storage capability, CSP can supplement photovoltaics by adding generation from solar resources during periods of low solar insolation. The falling cost of solar photovoltaic (PV) - generated electricity has led to a rapid increase in the deployment of PV and projections that PV could play a significant role in the future U.S. electric sector. The solar resource itself is virtually unlimited; however, the actual contribution of PV electricity is limited by several factors related to the current grid. The first is the limited coincidence between the solar resource and normal electricity demand patterns. The second is the limited flexibility of conventional generators to accommodate this highly variable generation resource. At high penetration of solar generation, increased grid flexibility will be needed to fully utilize the variable and uncertain output from PV generation and to shift energy production to periods of high demand or reduced solar output. Energy storage is one way to increase grid flexibility, and many storage options are available or under development. In this article, however, we consider a technology already beginning to be used at scale - thermal energy storage (TES) deployed with concentrating solar power (CSP). PV and CSP are both deployable in areas of high direct normal irradiance such as the U.S. Southwest. The role of these two technologies is dependent on their costs and relative value, including how their value to the grid changes as a function of what percentage of total generation they contribute to the grid, and how they may actually work together to increase overall usefulness of the solar resource. Both PV and CSP use solar energy to generate electricity. A key difference is the ability of CSP to utilize high-efficiency TES, which turns CSP into a partially dispatchable resource. The addition of TES produces additional value by shifting the delivery of solar energy to periods of peak demand, providing firm capacity and ancillary services, and reducing integration challenges. Given the dispatchability of CSP enabled by TES, it is possible that PV and CSP are at least partially complementary. The dispatchability of CSP with TES can enable higher overall penetration of the grid by solar energy by providing solar-generated electricity during periods of cloudy weather or at night, when PV-generated power is unavailable. Such systems also have the potential to improve grid flexibility, thereby enabling greater penetration of PV energy (and other variable generation sources such as wind) than if PV were deployed without CSP.","","","National Renewable Energy Lab.

A thin CdTe absorber contributes to the right branch of the U-shape due to a punch-through effect at reverse or zero biases, when the CdTe absorber is nearly fully depleted. A rectifying back-contact contributes to both branches of the U-shape due to voltage sharing with the front junction under a forward bias and early punch-through under a reverse bias. Deep levels contribute to the right branch, but also raise the bottom of the U-shape, leading to an overestimate of carrier density.","","","National Renewable Energy Lab.

The origin of the enhancement is clarified by studying the interfacial energy level alignment between PCDTBT or the 1:4 blended heterojunctions and PEDOT:PSS or NiO{sub x} using ultraviolet and inverse photoemission spectroscopies. The 1.6 eV electronic gap of PEDOT:PSS and energy level alignment with the BHJ result in poor hole selectivity of PEDOT:PSS and allows electron recombination at the PEDOT:PSS/BHJ interface. Conversely, the large band gap (3.7 eV) of NiO{sub x} and interfacial dipole (0.6 eV) with the organic active layer leads to a hole-selective interface. This interfacial dipole yields enhanced electron blocking properties by increasing the barrier to electron injection. The presence of such a strong dipole is predicted to further promote hole collection from the organic layer into the oxide, resulting in increased fill factor and short circuit current. An overall decrease in recombination is manifested in an increase in open circuit voltage and power conversion efficiency of the device on NiO{sub x} versus PEDOT:PSS interlayers.","","","National Renewable Energy Lab.

Achieving this may require substantial changes to current transportation fuel systems for distribution, dispensing, and use in vehicles. The U.S. Department of Energy and the National Renewable Energy Laboratory designed a system dynamics approach to help focus government action by determining what supply chain changes would have the greatest potential to accelerate biofuels deployment. The National Renewable Energy Laboratory developed the Biomass Scenario Model, a system dynamics model which represents the primary system effects and dependencies in the biomass-to-biofuels supply chain. The model provides a framework for developing scenarios and conducting biofuels policy analysis. This paper focuses on the downstream portion of the supply chain-represented in the distribution logistics, dispensing station, and fuel utilization, and vehicle modules of the Biomass Scenario Model. This model initially focused on ethanol, but has since been expanded to include other biofuels. Some portions of this system are represented dynamically with major interactions and feedbacks, especially those related to a dispensing station owner's decision whether to offer ethanol fuel and a consumer's choice whether to purchase that fuel. Other portions of the system are modeled with little or no dynamics; the vehicle choices of consumers are represented as discrete scenarios. This paper explores conditions needed to sustain an ethanol fuel market and identifies implications of these findings for program and policy goals. A large, economically sustainable ethanol fuel market (or other biofuel market) requires low end-user fuel price relative to gasoline and sufficient producer payment, which are difficult to achieve simultaneously. Other requirements (different for ethanol vs. other biofuel markets) include the need for infrastructure for distribution and dispensing and widespread use of high ethanol blends in flexible-fuel vehicles.","","","National Renewable Energy Lab.

Currently, the mechanism underlying this process is unclear. Here, we describe the development of an experimental method for measuring charge creation yields in organic solar cell materials. We use this method to examine a series of conjugated polymer:fullerene blend films and observe two unexpected features: the existence of an optimal driving force and a loss in conversion efficiency if this force is exceeded. These observations have implications for the design of excitonic photovoltaic devices and can be explained by a simple Marcus formulation that introduces the importance of reorganization energy.","","","National Renewable Energy Lab.

Interfacial molecular layers provide a way of adjusting these devices to improve their performance. We have studied a prototypical system involving poly(3-hexylthiophene) (P3HT) on planar zinc oxide (ZnO) films that have been modified with two types of molecules having identical 18-carbon alkyl chain termination and different surface attachments: octadecanethiol (ODT) and octadecyltriethoxysilane (OTES). We examined the functionalized surfaces using water contact angle measurements, Kelvin probe measurements, infrared absorbance spectroscopy, and atomic force microscopy. These have shown that OTES forms disordered incomplete monolayers, while ODT is prone to develop multilayered islands. Both treatments enhance polymer ordering. However, inverted solar cell devices fabricated with these treated interfaces performed very differently. ODT improves the short circuit current (J{sub SC}), open circuit voltage (V{sub OC}), and power conversion efficiency ({eta}), while these parameters all decrease in devices constructed from OTES-treated ZnO. The differences in V{sub OC} are related to modifications of the surface dipole associated with deposition of the two types of alkyl molecules, while changes in J{sub SC} are attributed to a balance between charge transfer blocking caused by the saturated hydrocarbon and the improved hole mobility in the polymer.","","","National Renewable Energy Lab.

We investigated, by temperature-dependent time-of-flight measurements, the influence of proton intercalation on the electron-transport properties of nanoporous TiO{sub 2} films exposed to an ethanol electrolyte containing different percentages of water (0-10%). These measurements revealed that increasing the water content in the electrolyte led to increased proton intercalation into the TiO{sub 2} films, slower transport, and a dramatic change in the dependence of the thermal activation energy (E{sub a}) of the electron diffusion coefficient on the photogenerated electron density in the films. Random walk simulations based on a microscopic model incorporating exponential conduction band tail (CBT) trap states combined with a proton-induced shallow trap level with a long residence time accounted for the observed effects of proton intercalation on E{sub a}. Application of this model to the experimental results explains the conditions under which E{sub a} dependence on the photoelectron density is consistent with multiple trapping in exponential CBT states and under which it appears at variance with this model.","","","National Renewable Energy Lab.

Copolymers of thienoisoindoledione (TID) and benzodithiophene (BDT) had appreciably lower band gaps (by {approx}0.4 eV) than copolymers of thienopyrroledione (TPD) and BDT. In addition to intramolecular charge transfer stabilization (i.e., the 'push-pull' effect), the former copolymer's quinoid resonance structure is stabilized by a gain in aromatic resonance energy in the isoindole unit. Additionally, the HOMO levels of the copolymers could be tuned with chemical modifications to the BDT monomer, resulting in open circuit voltages of greater than 1 V in photovoltaic devices. Despite the optimized band gap, TID containing polymers displayed lower photoconductance, as determined by time-resolved microwave conductivity, and decreased device efficiency (2.1% vs 4.8%) as compared with TPD analogues. These results were partially attributed to morphology, as computational modeling suggests TID copolymers have a twisted backbone, and X-ray diffraction data indicate the polymer films do not form ordered domains, whereas TPD copolymers are considerably more planar and are shown to form partially ordered domains.","","","National Renewable Energy Lab.

These layers are either fully solution-processed, using orthogonal solvents for the layers of the polymer poly(3-hexylthiophene) (P3HT) and the fullerene phenyl-C{sup 61}-butyric acid methyl ester (PCBM), or prepared by thermally evaporating a C{sup 60} layer onto P3HT films. Our work is motivated by the remarkable efficiency of organic photovoltaic (OPV) devices using a sequentially processed P3HT/PCBM active layer. Here we use an electrodeless photoconductivity probe, so we can photoexcite the sample either through the polymer or the fullerene layer. We use samples with extremely thick P3HT films (2.4 {micro}m) and show that excitation from either side of both as-cast and thermally annealed sample yields virtually identical results, consistent with mixing of the PCBM into the polymer film. We also compare solution-deposited samples to samples made by thermally evaporating C{sup 60} on P3HT, and find that we can distinguish between charge generation in bulk-P3HT and at the polymer/fullerene interface. We show that, despite their morphological differences, the carrier dynamics in the sequentially processed samples resemble those of mixed, bulk heterojunction (BHJ) systems. All of this is consistent with the idea that PCBM readily mixes into the P3HT film in sequentially deposited P3HT/PCBM samples, although the total amount of fullerene mixed into the P3HT appears to be less than that typically used in an optimized BHJ. Finally, we discuss the implications for OPV device architectures prepared by sequential deposition from solution.","","","National Renewable Energy Lab.

Silicon wafers account for almost half the cost of today's solar photovoltaic panels, so reducing or eliminating wafer costs is essential to bringing prices down. Current crystalline silicon technology converts energy in a highly efficient manner; however, that technology is manufactured with processes that could stand some improvement. The industry needs a method that is less complex, creates less waste and uses less energy. First, half the refined silicon is lost as dust in the wafer-sawing process, driving module costs higher. Wafers are sawn off of large cylindrical ingots, or boules, of silicon. A typical 2-meter boule loses as many as 6,000 potential wafers during sawing. Second, the wafers produced are much thicker than necessary. To efficiently convert sunlight into electricity, the wafers need be only one-tenth the typical thickness. NREL, the Oak Ridge National Laboratory and Ampulse have partnered on an approach to eliminate this waste and dramatically lower the cost of the finished solar panels. By using a chemical vapor deposition process to grow the silicon on inexpensive foil, Ampulse is able to make the solar cells just thick enough to convert most of the solar energy into electricity. No more sawdust - and no more wasting refined silicon materials. NREL developed the technology to grow high-quality silicon and ORNL developed the metal foil that has the correct crystal structure to support that growth. Ampulse is installing a pilot manufacturing line in NREL's Process Development Integration Laboratory, where solar companies can work closely with lab scientists on integrated equipment to answer pressing questions related to their technology development, as well as rapidly overcoming R and D challenges and risk. NREL's program is focused on transformative innovation in the domestic PV industry. With knowledge and expertise acquired from the PDIL pilot production line tools, Ampulse plans to design a full-scale production line to accommodate long rolls of metal foil. The Ampulse process 'goes straight from pure silicon-containing gas to high-quality crystal silicon film,' said Brent Nelson, the operational manager for the Process Development Integration Laboratory. 'The advantage is you can make the wafer just as thin as you need it - 10 microns or less.' Most of today's solar cells are made out of wafer crystalline silicon, though thin-film cells made of more exotic elements such as copper, indium, gallium, arsenic, cadmium, tellurium and others are making a strong push into the market. The advantage of silicon is its abundance, because it is derived from sand. Silicon's disadvantage is that purifying it into wafers suitable for solar cells can be expensive and energy intensive. Manufacturers add carbon and heat to sand to produce metallurgical-grade silicon, which is useful in other industries, but not yet suitable for making solar cells. So this metallurgical-grade silicon is then converted to pure trichlorosilane (SiCl3) or silane (SiH4) gas. Typically, the purified gas is then converted to create a silicon feedstock at 1,000 degrees Celsius. This feedstock is melted at 1,414 C and recrystallized into crystal ingots that are finally sawed into wafers. The Ampulse method differs in that it eliminates the last two steps in the traditional process and works directly with the silane gas growing only the needed silicon right onto a foil substrate. A team of NREL scientists had developed a way to use a process called hot-wire chemical vapor deposition to thicken silicon wafers with near perfect crystal structure. Using a hot tungsten filament much like the one found in an incandescent light bulb, the silane gas molecules are broken apart and deposited onto the wafer using the chemical vapor deposition technique at about 700 C - a much lower temperature than needed to make the wafer. The hot filament decomposes the gas, allowing silicon layers to deposit directly onto the substrate. Armed with this new technique, Branz and Teplin searched for ways to grow the silicon on cheaper materials and still use it for solar cells. They found the ideal synergy when visiting venture capitalists from Battelle Ventures asked them whether they could do anything useful with a breakthrough from Oak Ridge's superconducting wire development group. The new development, called the rolling assisted biaxially textured substrate (RABiTS), was just the opportunity the two scientists had been seeking. If metal foil is to work as a substrate, it must be able to act as a seed crystal so the silicon can grow on it with the correct structure. The RABiTS process forms crystals in the foil that are correctly oriented to receive the silicon atoms and lock them into just the right positions.","","","National Renewable Energy Lab.

Thin films were characterized by X-ray diffraction (XRD), photocurrent spectroscopy (PS), inductively coupled plasma (ICP) analysis, and scanning electron microscopy (SEM). The detailed analysis from X-ray reveals that after annealing at 550 C the CuGaSe{sub 2} phase is formed when the thickness of Ga is 0.25 {mu}m, however at 0.5 {mu}m and 1.0 {mu}m Ga the formation of CuGa{sub 3}Se{sub 5} and CuGa{sub 5}Se{sub 8} phases is observed respectively.

In this paper, we focus on the compositional and mechanistic aspects of CdS:CaI complexes that control the photochemical conversion of solar energy into H{sub 2}. Self-assembly of CdS with CaI was driven by electrostatics, demonstrated as the inhibition of ferredoxin-mediated H{sub 2} evolution by CaI. Production of H{sub 2} by CdS:CaI was observed only under illumination and only in the presence of a sacrificial donor. We explored the effects of the CdS:CaI molar ratio, sacrificial donor concentration, and light intensity on photocatalytic H{sub 2} production, which were interpreted on the basis of contributions to electron transfer, hole transfer, or rate of photon absorption, respectively. Each parameter was found to have pronounced effects on the CdS:CaI photocatalytic activity. Specifically, we found that under 405 nm light at an intensity equivalent to total AM 1.5 solar flux, H{sub 2} production was limited by the rate of photon absorption ({approx}1 ms{sup -1}) and not by the turnover of CaI. Complexes were capable of H{sub 2} production for up to 4 h with a total turnover number of 106 before photocatalytic activity was lost. This loss correlated with inactivation of CaI, resulting from the photo-oxidation of the CdS capping ligand MPA.","","","National Renewable Energy Lab.

However, to date, the polydispersity present in as-synthesized SWCNT populations has obscured the dependence of the SWCNT {sup 13}C chemical shift on intrinsic parameters such as diameter and electronic structure, meaning that no information is gleaned for specific SWCNTs with unique chiral indices. In this article, we utilize a combination of {sup 13}C labeling and density gradient ultracentrifugation (DGU) to produce an array of {sup 13}C-labeled SWCNT populations with varying diameter, electronic structure, and chiral angle. We find that the SWCNT isotropic {sup 13}C chemical shift decreases systematically with increasing diameter for semiconducting SWCNTs, in agreement with recent theoretical predictions that have heretofore gone unaddressed. Furthermore, we find that the {sup 13}C chemical shifts for small diameter metallic and semiconducting SWCNTs differ significantly, and that the full-width of the isotropic peak for metallic SWCNTs is much larger than that of semiconducting nanotubes, irrespective of diameter.","","","National Renewable Energy Lab.

The investors for these projects calculate the expected return on investment based on expected electricity generation and adjust the interest rates and other financial terms according to the perceived risk. These calculations usually assume worst case according to thelisted warranty and any uncertainty in the measurement is translated directly into a reduced predicted performance. Because a 1% difference in predicted output could represent a large fraction of the expected return on investment, a small reduction in uncertainty translates into a much larger value to the entity making investment decisions. To reduce perceived risk in large-scale solarinvestments power plant performance (or production) guarantees have become increasingly common.

An important aspect of OPV device efficiency is good contact engineering. The use of oxide thin films for this application offers increased design flexibility and improved chemical stability. Here we present our investigation of radio frequency magnetron sputtered nickel oxide (NiO{sub x}) deposited from oxide targets as an efficient, easily scalable hole transport layer (HTL) with variable work-function, ranging from 4.8 to 5.8 eV. Differences in HTL work-function were not found to result in statistically significant changes in open circuit voltage (V{sub oc}) for poly(3-hexylthiophene):[6,6]-phenyl-C{sub 61}-butyric acid methyl ester (P3HT:PCBM) BHJ device. Ultraviolet photoemission spectroscopy (UPS) characterization of the NiO{sub x} film and its interface with the polymer shows Fermi level alignment of the polymer with the NiO{sub x} film. UPS of the blend also demonstrates Fermi level alignment of the organic active layer with the HTL, consistent with the lack of correlation between V{sub oc} and HTL work-function. Instead, trends in j{sub sc}, V{sub oc}, and thus overall device performance are related to the surface treatment of the HTL prior to active layer deposition through changes in active layer thickness.","","","National Renewable Energy Lab.

The ACP consists of domeless thermopile pyrgeometer, gold-plated concentrator, temperature controller, and data acquisition. The dome was removed from the pyrgeometer to remove errors associated with dome transmittance and the dome correction factor. To avoid thermal convection and wind effect errors resulting from using a domeless thermopile, the gold-plated concentrator was placed above the thermopile. The concentrator is a dual compound parabolic concentrator (CPC) with 180{sup o} view angle to measure the outdoor incoming longwave irradiance from the atmosphere. The incoming irradiance is reflected from the specular gold surface of the CPC and concentrated on the 11 mm diameter of the pyrgeometer's blackened thermopile. The CPC's interior surface design and the resulting cavitation result in a throughput value that was characterized by the National Institute of Standards and Technology. The ACP was installed horizontally outdoor on an aluminum plate connected to the temperature controller to control the pyrgeometer's case temperature. The responsivity of the pyrgeometer's thermopile detector was determined by lowering the case temperature and calculating the rate of change of the thermopile output voltage versus the changing net irradiance. The responsivity is then used to calculate the absolute atmospheric longwave irradiance with an uncertainty estimate (U{sub 95}) of {+-}3.96 W m{sup 02} with traceability to the International System of Units, SI. The measured irradiance was compared with the irradiance measured by two pyrgeometers calibrated by the World Radiation Center with traceability to the Interim World Infrared Standard Group, WISG. A total of 408 readings were collected over three different nights. The calculated irradiance measured by the ACP was 1.5 W/m{sup 2} lower than that measured by the two pyrgeometers that are traceable to WISG, with a standard deviation of {+-}0.7 W m{sup -2}. These results suggest that the ACP design might be used for addressing the need to improve the international reference for broadband outdoor longwave irradiance measurements.","","","National Renewable Energy Lab.

Third-party PV companies can reduce or eliminate up-front adoption costs, reduce technology risk and complexity by monitoring system performance, and can repackage the PV value proposition by showing cost savings in the first month of ownership rather than payback times on the order of a decade. We find that the entrance of third-party business models in southern California residential PV markets has enticed a new demographic to adopt PV systems that is more highly correlated to younger, less affluent, and less educated populations than the demographics correlated to purchasing PV systems. By enticing new demographics to adopt PV, we find that third-party PV products are likely increasing total PV demand rather than gaining market share entirely at the expense of existing customer owned PV demand. We also find that mean population demographics are good predictors of third-party and customer owned PV adoption, and mean voting trends on California carbon policy (Proposition 23) are poor predictors of PV adoption.","","","National Renewable Energy Lab.

The silane is attached at a single point on the quantum dot surface to avoid cross-linking and multilayer formation, and photoluminescence spectroscopy shows the colloidal suspension of dots is stable for over two months in air. The hydroxyl-terminated surfaces required for silanization are created by wet chemical etch, which can be used to tune the luminescence of the silicon dots in the green- to red-wavelength range. We find, however, that the wet etch cannot move the emission into the blue-wavelength range and discuss this observation in terms of the nature of etching process and origin of the emission.

In this work, we present measurements of carrier multiplication yields and biexciton lifetimes for a large selection of PbS nanocrystals and compare these results to the well-studied PbSe nanocrystals. The similar bulk properties of PbS and PbSe make this an important comparison for discerning the pertinent properties that determine efficient carrier multiplication. We observe that PbS and PbSe have very similar biexciton lifetimes as a function of confinement energy. Together with the similar bulk properties, this suggests that the rates of multiexciton generation, which is the inverse of Auger recombination, are also similar. The carrier multiplication yields in PbS nanocrystals, however, are strikingly lower than those observed for PbSe nanocrystals. We suggest that this implies the rate of competing processes, such as phonon emission, is higher in PbS nanocrystals than in PbSe nanocrystals. Indeed, our estimations for phonon emission mediated by the polar Froehlich-type interaction indicate that the corresponding energy-loss rate is approximately twice as large in PbS than in PbSe.","","","National Renewable Energy Lab.

Because device performances depend on the nanoscale film morphologies, most attention and extensive efforts have been invested in improving the nanofabrication of hybrid films. Nevertheless, the reported conjugated polymer/metal oxide device efficiencies are still far poorer than those of all-organic and solid-state dye-sensitized metal oxide solar cells. To decouple the effect of insufficient morphology control from other generic photocurrent-limiting processes, we study the photocurrent generation at conjugated polymer-metal oxide interfaces in self-organized, highly ordered, and uniform hybrid nanostructures. A combination of small-angle X-ray scattering, high-resolution transmission electron microscopy (TEM), and energy-filtered TEM confirms the structure and composition of the highly ordered, high interfacial area hybrid cubic mesostructured films prepared by the coassembly of a titania precursor species, a water-soluble polythiophene derivative, and a block copolymer surfactant. Contactless time-resolved microwave photoconductivity (TRMC) measurements show a moderate 2-fold increase in the photoconductivity of the highly ordered TiO{sub x}/conjugated polymer mesostructured film compared to that of a pristine film of the same polymer, indicating inefficient exciton dissociation at the oxide/polymer interface. Furthermore, strong correlation between the TRMC results and the device performance reveals that most of the photogenerated carriers in the conjugated polymer/TiO{sub x} photovoltaic device originate from exciton dissociation in the polymer bulk, followed by electron transfer from the polymer to the metal oxide, and not at the interface. Therefore, the photovoltaic devices utilizing the highly ordered conjugated polymer/metal oxide mesostructured films are not primarily limited by insufficient morphology control but rather by the inefficient process of exciton dissociation in the polymer. This observation is in agreement with the low photocurrent densities generally observed in photovoltaic devices comprising conjugated polymer/metal oxide active layers.","","","National Renewable Energy Lab.

We found that the N concentration in ZnO:N thin films can be effectively controlled by varying the RF power. ZnO:N films with narrowed bandgaps were synthesized. The photoelectrochemical properties of nitrogen-incorporated ZnO (ZnO:N) films were measured and compared with those of pure ZnO films. We find that nitrogen incorporation narrows the bandgap of ZnO and shifts the optical absorption into the visible-light regions. We further find that the ZnO:N films provide considerable photoresponse in the long-wavelength regions. As a result, the ZnO:N films exhibit higher photocurrents than pure ZnO films.","","","National Renewable Energy Lab.

Solar industry has seen an enormous growth during the last decade. The sale of PV modules has exceeded 27 GW in 2011, with significant contributions to the market share from all technologies. While the silicon technology continues to have the dominant share, the other thin film technologies (CdTe, CIGS, a-Si, and organic PV) are experiencing fast growth. Increased production of silicon modules has led to a very rapid reduction in their price and remains as benchmark for other technologies. The PV industry is in full gear to commercialize new automated equipment for solar cell and module production, instrumentation for process monitoring technologies, and for implementation of other cost-reduction approaches, and extensive research continues to be carried out in many laboratories to improve the efficiency of solar cells and modules without increasing the production costs. A large variety of solar cells, which differ in the material systems used, design, PV structure, and even the principle of PV conversion, are designed to date. This special issue contains peer-reviewed papers in the recent developments in research related to broad spectrum of photovoltaic materials and devices. It contains papers on many aspects of solar cells-the growth and deposition, characterization, and new material development.","","","National Renewable Energy Lab.
