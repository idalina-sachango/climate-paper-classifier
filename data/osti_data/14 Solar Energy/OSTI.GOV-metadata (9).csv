We found that the hematite films deposited in the N{sub 2}/O{sub 2} ambient exhibit much poorer crystallinity than the films deposited in the Ar/O{sub 2} ambient. We determined that Ti alloying leads to increased electron carrier concentration and crystallinity, and reduced bandgaps. Moreover, Ti-alloyed hematite thin films exhibited improved photoelectrochemical performance as compared with the pure hematite films: The photocurrents were enhanced and the photocurrent onset shifted to less positive potentials.","","","National Renewable Energy Lab.

The printed Ag contacts are being developed to replace the currently employed evaporated Ni/Al bi-layer contacts. Inkjet deposition conditions were optimized to reduce line resistivity and reduce contact resistance to the Al:ZnO layer. Ag lines printed at a substrate temperature of 200 C showed a line resistivity of 2.06 {mu}{Omega} {center_dot} cm and a contact resistance to Al:ZnO of 8.2 {+-} 0.2 m{Omega} {center_dot} cm{sup 2} compared to 6.93 {+-} 0.3 m{Omega} {center_dot} cm{sup 2} for thermally evaporated contacts. These deposition conditions were used to deposit front contacts onto high quality CIGS thin film photovoltaic cells. The heating required to print the Ag contacts caused the performance to degrade compared to similar devices with evaporated Ni/Al contacts that were not heated. Devices with inkjet printed contacts showed 11.4% conversion efficiency compared to 14.8% with evaporated contacts. Strategies to minimize heating, which is detrimental for efficiency, during inkjet printing are proposed.","","","National Renewable Energy Lab.

Results obtained by various groups have been incorporated and compared in this study. The highest efficiency reported so far for mc-Si solar cells is 20{center_dot}4% and 17-18% by research laboratories and commercial houses, respectively. The efficiency can be further enhanced if passivation characteristics on both the front and back surface are improved. The role of back surface recombination has become more significant in light of the use of thin mc-Si wafers by the solar cell industry. Based on the passivation characteristics and considering the understanding of the past three decades of studies, the authors have proposed and simulated a structure for mc-Si solar cells to improve the performance of the same. The results of our modeled structure of mc-Si solar cell show an efficiency of 21{center_dot}88% with short-circuit current density, J{sub sc} = 39{center_dot}39 mA/cm2, and open circuit voltage, V{sub oc} = 0{center_dot}666 V.","","","National Renewable Energy Lab.

"Dielectric Properties of BST/(Y<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub>)<sub>x</sub>(ZrO<sub>2</sub>)<sub>1-x</sub>/BST Trilayer Films","Sahoo, Santosh K.; Misra, D.","14 SOLAR ENERGY; 36 MATERIALS SCIENCE; nanoelectronics; thin film; trilayer films; BST layer; dielectric properties","Thin films of Ba1-xSrxTiO3 (BST) are being actively investigated for applications in dynamic random access memories (DRAM) because of their properties such as high dielectric constant, low leakage current, and high dielectric breakdown strength. Various approaches have been used to improve the dielectric properties of BST thin films such as doping, graded compositions, and multilayer structures. We have found that inserting a ZrO2 layer in between two BST layers results in a significant reduction in dielectric constant as well as dielectric loss. In this work the effect of Y2O3 doped ZrO2 on the dielectric properties of BST/ZrO2/BST trilayer structure is studied. The structure Ba0.8Sr0.2TiO3/(Y2O3)x(ZrO2)1-x/Ba0.8Sr0.2TiO3 is deposited by a sol-gel process on platinized Si substrate. The composition (x) of the middle layer is varied while keeping the total thickness of the trilayer film constant. The dielectric constant of the multilayer film decreases with the increase of Y2O3 amount in the film whereas there is a slight variation in dielectric loss. In Y2O3 doped multilayer thin films, the dielectric loss is lower in comparison to other films and also there is good frequency stability in the loss in the measured frequency range and hence very suitable for microwave device applications.","Materials Research Society (MRS)","","National Renewable Energy Lab.

"Second-surface silvered glass solar mirrors of very high reflectance","Butel, Guillaume P.; VanSant, Kaitlyn; Sherif, Raed A.; Coughenour, Blake M.; Macleod, H.

Roger P.","14 SOLAR ENERGY; 47 OTHER INSTRUMENTATION; thin film; silver; high reflectance; concentrating; solar; mirror; reflector; CPV; CSP","This paper reports methods developed to maximize the overall reflectance second-surface silvered glass. The reflectance at shorter wavelengths is increased with the aid of a dielectric enhancing layer between the silver and the glass, while at longer wavelengths it is enhanced by use of glass with negligible iron content. The calculated enhancement of reflectance, compared to unenhanced silver on standard low-iron float glass, corresponds to a 4.4% increase in reflectance averaged across the full solar spectrum, appropriate for CSP, and 2.7% for CPV systems using triple junction cells. An experimental reflector incorporating these improvements, of drawn crown glass and a silvered second-surface with dielectric boost, was measured at NREL to have 95.4% solar weighted reflectance. For comparison, non-enhanced, wetsilvered reflectors of the same 4 mm thickness show reflectance ranging from 91.6 - 94.6%, depending on iron content. A potential drawback of using iron-free drawn glass is reduced concentration in high concentration systems because of the inherent surface errors. This effect is largely mitigated for glass shaped by slumping into a concave mold, rather than by bending.","SPIE","","National Renewable Energy Lab.

"The Value of Concentrating Solar Power and Thermal Energy Storage","Sioshansi, Ramteen; Denholm, Paul","14 SOLAR ENERGY; economics; solar power generation; thermal energy storage (TES)","Our paper examines the value of concentrating solar power (CSP) and thermal energy storage (TES) in a number of regions in the southwestern United States. Our analysis also shows that TES can increase the value of CSP by allowing more thermal energy from a CSP plant's solar field to be used, allowing a CSP plant to accommodate a larger solar field, and by allowing CSP generation to be shifted to hours with higher energy prices. We also analyze the sensitivity of this value to a number of factors, including the optimization period, price and solar forecasting, ancillary service sales, and dry cooling of the CSP plant, and also estimate the capacity value of a CSP plant with TES. We further discuss the value of CSP plants and TES net of capital costs.","IEEE","","National Renewable Energy Lab.

"Optimizing CdTe Solar Cell Performance: Impact of Variations in Minority-Carrier Lifetime and Carrier Density Profile","Kanevce, Ana; Gessert, Timothy A.","14 SOLAR ENERGY; carrier lifetime; photovoltaic cells; semiconductor device modeling; thin films","Using numerical simulations, we study the combined effects of nonuniform minority-carrier lifetime t and carrier density NA on device performance. In a uniformly doped device, maximum open-circuit voltage V oc is obtained for high t and high NA . The fill-factor (FF) is mainly dependent on the lifetime. When the lifetime is low, and NA is high, the FF suffers losses due to voltage-dependant carrier collection. For a low carrier density and low lifetime, the electric field strength is low, recombination is a competitive process to drift, and the FF is reduced. Simulations predict that it might be possible to increase the device efficiency with lower carrier density, if the back of the absorber is highly doped. This configuration increases the built-in potential and the electric field close to the junction region, while keeping the space-charge region wide. In addition, a device with such a profile is very tolerant toward lifetime variations of the highly doped layer. With our simulation parameters, when the absorber properties are uniform, efficiencies >;18% require experimentally unrealistic doping and lifetime values. If the back of the absorber is doped significantly higher than the rest, such efficiencies can be achieved with realistic values of doping and lifetime.","IEEE","","National Renewable Energy Lab.

In layers containing up to ~10% Bi, the two variants of CuPtB-type atomic ordering on {111} B planes were observed and this is believed to be associated with the surface reconstruction present during growth. In a sample containing ~13% Bi, no atomic ordering was observed but instead an anisotropic platelike structure was present that is believed to result from phase separation, possibly associated with the surface segregation of excess Bi during growth. In conclusion, both of these effects are expected to have significant effects on the electrical and optical properties of the material.","American Vacuum Society/AIP","","National Renewable Energy Lab.

These models can be classified as empirical or physical based on the approach. Empirical models relate ground-based observations with satellite measurements and use these relations to compute surface radiation. Physical models consider the physics behind the radiation received at the satellite and create retrievals to estimate surface radiation. Furthermore, while empirical methods have been traditionally used for computing surface radiation for the solar energy industry, the advent of faster computing has made operational physical models viable. The Global Solar Insolation Project (GSIP) is a physical model that computes DNI and GHI using the visible and infrared channel measurements from a weather satellite. GSIP uses a two-stage scheme that first retrieves cloud properties and uses those properties in a radiative transfer model to calculate GHI and DNI. Developed for polar orbiting satellites, GSIP has been adapted to NOAA's Geostationary Operation Environmental Satellite series and can run operationally at high spatial resolutions.

We found that Ga–N co-doped ZnO films exhibited enhanced crystallinity when compared to undoped ZnO films grown under the same conditions. Furthermore, Ga–N co-doping ensured enhanced N-incorporation ZnO thin films as the substrate temperature is increased. As a result, Ga–N co-doped ZnO thin films exhibited much improved photoelectrochemical (PEC) response, compared to ZnO thin films. Our results therefore suggest that the passive co-doping approach could be a means to improve PEC response for bandgap-reduced wide-bandgap oxides through impurity incorporation.","Springer","","National Renewable Energy Lab.

They physically hold components in place, provide electrical insulation, optically couple superstrate materials (e.g., glass) to PV cells, protect components from mechanical stress by mechanically de-coupling components via strain relief, and protect materials from corrosion. To do this, encapsulants must adhere well to all surfaces, remain compliant, and transmit light after exposure to temperature, humidity, and UV radiation histories. Encapsulant materials by themselves do not completely prevent water vapour ingress [1-3], but if they are well adhered, they will prevent the accumulation of liquid water providing protection against corrosion as well as electrical shock. Here, a brief review of some of the polymeric materials under consideration for PV applications is provided, with an explanation of some of their advantages and disadvantages.","","","National Renewable Energy Lab.

This paper evaluates biomass pathways for hydrogen production and how they can be integrated with renewable resources to improve the efficiency, reliability, dispatchability, and cost of other renewable technologies. Two hybrid concepts were analyzed that involve co-production of gaseous hydrogen and electric power from thermochemical biorefineries. Both of the concepts analyzed share the basic idea of combining intermittent wind-generated electricity with a biomass gasification plant. The systems were studied in detail for process feasibility and economic performance. The best performing system was estimated to produce hydrogen at a cost of $1.67/kg. The proposed hybrid systems seek to either fill energy shortfalls by supplying hydrogen to a peaking natural gas turbine or to absorb excess renewable power during low-demand hours. Direct leveling of intermittent renewable electricity production is accomplished with either an indirectly heated biomass gasifier, or a directly heated biomass gasifier. The indirect gasification concepts studied were found to be cost competitive in cases where value is placed on controlling carbon emissions. A carbon tax in the range of $26-40 per metric ton of CO{sub 2} equivalent (CO{sub 2}e) emission makes the systems studied cost competitive with steam methane reforming (SMR) to produce hydrogen. However, some additional value must be placed on energy peaking or sinking for these plants to be economically viable. The direct gasification concept studied replaces the air separation unit (ASU) with an electrolyzer bank and is unlikely to be cost competitive in the near future. High electrolyzer costs and wind power requirements make the hybridization difficult to justify economically without downsizing the system. Based on a direct replacement of the ASU with electrolyzers, hydrogen can be produced for $0.27 premium per kilogram. Additionally, if a non-renewable, grid-mix electricity is used, the hybrid system is found to be a net CO{sub 2}e emitter.","New York, NY: American Society of Mechanical Engineers (ASME)","","National Renewable Energy Lab.

At present, PV is predominately based on crystalline and polycrystalline Si and is growing at >40% per year with production rapidly approaching 3 gigawatts/year with PV installations supplying <1% of energy used in the world. Increased cell efficiency and reduced manufacturing expenses are critical in achieving reasonable costs for PV and solarthermal. CdTe thin-film solar cells have reported a manufactured cost of $1.25/watt. There is also the promise of increased efficiency by use of multijunction cells or hybrid devices organized at the nanoscale. This could lead to conversion efficiencies of greater than 50%.

For HIT cells with p-type wafers, only tunneling at the back-contact barrier may be important. For p-wafer cells, the hydrogenated amorphous silicon (a-Si:H) between the indium tin oxide (ITO) and crystalline silicon may act as a passivating buffer layer but, otherwise, does not significantly contribute to device performance.

Using available experimental crystallographic data as a guide, we propose a detailed structural model for the packing of solid PPEEB. We find that due to the localized nature of the band edge wave function, theoretical approaches beyond the standard method, such as hybrid functional (PBE0), are required to correctly characterize the band structure of this material. Moreover, unlike previous assumptions, we observe the formation of hydrogen bonds between the side chains of different molecules, which leads to a dispersion of the energy levels. This result indicates that the side chains of the molecular crystal not only are responsible for its structural conformation but also can be used for tuning the electronic and optical properties of these materials.","","","National Renewable Energy Lab.

The phase evolution of the binary (In-Se and Cu-Se) and ternary (Cu-In-Se) MOD precursor films was examined during processing to evaluate the nature of the phase and composition changes. The In-Se binary precursor exhibits two specific phase regimes: (i) a cubic-InxSey phase at processing temperatures between 300 and 400 C and (ii) the {gamma}-In{sub 2}Se{sub 3} phase for films annealed above 450 C. Both phases exhibit a composition of 40 at.% indium and 60 at.% selenium. The binary Cu-Se precursor films show more diverse phase behavior, and within a narrow temperature processing range a number of Cu-Se phases, including CuSe{sub 2}, CuSe, and Cu{sub 2}Se, can be produced and stabilized. The ternary Cu-In-Se precursor can be used to produce relatively dense CuInSe{sub 2} films at temperatures between 300 and 500 C. Layering the binary precursors together has provided an approach to producing CuInSe{sub 2} thin films; however, the morphology of the layered binary structure exhibits a significant degree of porosity. An alternative method of layering was explored where the Cu-Se binary was layered on top of an existing indium-gallium-selenide layer and processed. This method produced highly dense and large-grained (&gt;3 {micro}m) CuInSe{sub 2} thin films. This has significant potential as a manufacturable route to CIGS-based solar cells.","","","National Renewable Energy Lab.

Here, we present a means of addressing the low voltage output by introducing novel trimetallic nitride endohedral fullerenes (TNEFs) as acceptor materials for use in photovoltaic devices. TNEFs were discovered in 1999 by Stevenson et al.; for the first time derivatives of the TNEF acceptor, Lu{sub 3}N{at}C{sub 80}, are synthesized and integrated into OPV devices. The reduced energy offset of the molecular orbitals of Lu{sub 3}N{at}C{sub 80} to the donor, poly(3-hexyl)thiophene (P3HT), reduces energy losses in the charge transfer process and increases the open circuit voltage (V{sub oc}) to 260 mV above reference devices made with [6,6]-phenyl-C{sub 61}-butyric methyl ester (C{sub 60}-PCBM) acceptor. PCEs &gt;4% have been observed using P3HT as the donor material.

Wide-depletion width devices generate significant photocurrents using an n-i-p structure grown by molecular-beam epitaxy, but these wide depletion widths are only realized in a region of parameter space that leads to rough surface morphologies. Surfactants are effective at reducing the surface roughness, but lead to increased defect densities and changes in the net acceptor or donor concentration. Here, we show that increasing the growth rate of GaInNAs solar cells leads to smooth surfaces without the use of a surfactant, even at high In compositions and substrate temperatures. No degradation in material quality is observed when increasing the growth rate from 1.5 to 3.0 {micro}m/h, but a shunt resistance does appear for the high-growth-rate samples. This shunt is attributed to increased spitting of the Ga cell, leading to an increase in the oval defect density, at the higher effusion cell temperatures used to achieve high growth rates. As with the case of Bi in GaInNAs, increased growth rates also appear to increase the net donor concentration, but it is not clear if these effects have the same cause.","","","National Renewable Energy Lab.

Nb-doped TiO{sub 2} (NTO) layers deposited on conventional Sn-doped In{sub 2}O{sub 3} (ITO) substrates using pulsed laser deposition (PLD) enhanced the optical-to-electrical conversion efficiency of the DSSCs by as much as 17% compared to that of bare ITO-based DSSCs. The electrical properties and J-V characteristics of the multilayered NTO/ITO films showed that the improved cell performance was due to the facilitated charge injection from TiO{sub 2} to ITO that resulted from the formation of an ohmic contact with ITO, as well as the conserved high conductivity of ITO after the oxidizing annealing process. Moreover, the NTO/ITO-based DSSC exhibited higher efficiency than a F-doped SnO{sub 2}(FTO)-based one, which demonstrates that optimization of multilayered NTO-based TCOs is a realistic approach for achieving highly efficient photoenergy conversion devices.","","","National Renewable Energy Lab.

Fundamentally, the proposed heat pump consists of an aqueous CaCl{sub 2} solution flow separated from a water flow by a vapor-permeable membrane. The low activity of the solution results in a net flux of water vapor across the membrane, which heats the solution stream and cools the water stream. This mechanism upgrades water-side low-temperature heat to solution-side high-temperature heat, creating a 'temperature lift.' The modeling results show that using two membranes and an air gap instead of a single membrane increases the temperature lift by 185%. The model predicts temperature lifts for the air-gap design of 24, 16, and 6 C for inlet temperatures of 55, 35, and 15 C, respectively. Membranes with lower thermal conductivities and higher porosities improve the performance of single-membrane designs while thinner membranes improve the performance of air-gap designs. This device can be used with a solar heating system which already uses concentrated salt solutions for liquid-desiccant cooling.","","","National Renewable Energy Lab.

Here we discuss five new thiophene-based dendrimers that were synthesized in order to study the relationship between their chemical structures and electronic properties. Three of these dendrimers incorporate acetylene spacers, included to relieve steric strain, between the thiophene arms and phenyl cores used in previous studies. Only a small effect on the electronic properties is observed upon inclusion of the acetylene spacer in the three-arm dendrimer, 3G1-2S-Ac. In contrast, a decrease in the bandgap is observed for the four-arm dendrimer, 4G1-2S-Ac, due to a reduction of interactions between the arms in the more sterically congested 1,2,4,5-arrangement around the phenyl core, resulting in delocalization of the exciton through the phenyl core. Incorporation of electron-withdrawing cyano groups on the phenyl core of the three-arm dendrimer, 3G1-2S-CN, resulted in a very large ({approx}0.5 eV) decrease in the bandgap, due to stabilization of the lowest unoccupied molecular orbital, and the low energy absorption band in this material is attributed to a transition with significant intramolecular charge-transfer character. The electronic properties of three- and four-arm dendrimers with electron-donating dibutylaniline moieties attached to the end of the thiophene dendron, 3G1-2S-N and 4G1-2S-N respectively, are almost identical, indicating that they are dominated by the arms, with no through-core communication allowed, even for the para-linked arms of 4G1-2S-N. However, there is a significant increase in the molar absorptivity of these materials, concomitant with significant broadening of the absorption spectrum, which is an important attribute in light-harvesting applications.","","","National Renewable Energy Lab.

The additional H{sub 2} annealing process recovered the electrical conductivity of the ITO film the same as its initial high conductivity, which enhanced the charge collecting property. Moreover, the employment of electrochemical oxidation of TiO{sub 2}/ITO photoelectrode improved the energy conversion efficiency of the ITO-based dye-sensitized solar cells (DSSC), higher than that of a conventional FTO-based DSSC. Electrochemical impedance analysis showed that the H2 annealing process reduced the internal resistance of the cell, i.e., the resistance of the ITO and the Schottky barrier at the TiO{sub 2}/ITO interface were reduced, and that the electrochemical treatment recovered the diodelike characteristics of the DSSC by retarding back electron transfer from the photoelectrode to the electrolyte. The present work demonstrates that thermally and electrochemically modified ITO-based photoelectrode is another alternative to the conventionally used FTO-based photoelectrode.","","","National Renewable Energy Lab.

We find that Zr allows IO-based films to maintain optical transparency as oxygen partial pressure in the sputter ambient decreases, and it also maintains high carrier concentration as the oxygen partial pressure increases. Applying this guidance could indicate pathways to improve film properties in large-area deposition systems. We also find that for films deposited at optimum oxygen partial pressure, the optical transparency of the IO-based films improves as Zr is added, especially in the near-infrared spectral region. Analysis of these films using Drude theory approximations indicate that optical improvement is due to an increase in dielectric permittivity caused by Zr addition. We propose that controlling dielectric permittivity may be an important strategy in improving other transparent conducting oxides (TCOs), as well as indicative of an important pathway to developing new TCOs.","","","National Renewable Energy Lab.

Because of the small pore size and electrical conductivity of the host material, it is challenging to employ electrochemical approaches to fill the entire pore network. Typically, during the electrochemical deposition process, the guest material blocks the pores of the host, precluding complete pore filling. We describe a general synthetic strategy for spatially controlling the growth of p-type semiconductors in the nanopores of electrically conducting n-type materials. As an illustration of this strategy, we report on the facile electrochemical deposition of p-CuInSe{sub 2} in nanoporous anatase n-TiO{sub 2} oriented nanotube arrays and nanoparticle films.

Our measurements of effective mass at the Fermi level indicate that as the carrier concentration increases, there is a shift from impurity-band transport to conduction-band transport, and that the electron effective mass is lower in the impurity band than in the conduction band of Si.

In this paper we investigate the critical parameters for both inkjet and ultrasonic spray deposition of PEDOT:PSS thin films on commercial indium tin oxide as a potentially scalable approach to contact formation. Inkjet parameters investigated include drop spacing and substrate temperature. Ultrasonic spray coating parameters investigated include substrate temperature and solution flow rate. We also show that the ink viscosity has a Newtonian character, making it well suited for inkjet printing. Films were characterized via optical profilometry, sheet resistance and atomic force microscopy. Optimized inkjet printed and ultrasonic sprayed PEDOT:PSS films were then compared to spincast layers in a prototypical bulk heterojunction photovoltaic device employing a poly(3-hexylthiophene) and [6,6]-PCBM (6,6-phenylC61-butyric acid-methyl ester) blend as the absorber.

A semiconductor based photoelectrolysis system may have cost advantages over using either a photovoltaic cell coupled to an electrolyzer or solar thermochemical cycles for water splitting. Unfortunately there is no known semiconducting material or combination of materials with the electronic properties and stability needed to efficiently photoelectrolyze water. Semiconducting oxides can have the required stability but present theoretical methods are insufficient to a priori identify materials with the required properties. Most likely, the discovered material will be a complex oxide containing many elements whereby each contributes to the required material properties such as light absorption across the solar spectrum, stability and electrocatalytic activity. The large number of possible multicomponent metal oxides, even if only ternary or quaternary materials are considered, points to the use of high-throughput combinatorial methods to discover and optimize candidate materials. In this critical review, we will cover some techniques for the combinatorial production and screening of metal oxides for their ability to efficiently split water with sunlight (88 references).","","","National Renewable Energy Lab.

Here, a co-sputtering composition spread combinatorial approach was used to examine the conductivity and optical transparency in a-IZO thin films as a function of both In : Zn metals stoichiometry and the amount of oxygen added to the argon sputter gas. For optimising the conductivity, the percent oxygen in the sputter gas and the metals composition were found to have a strongly coupled effect. In particular, a-IZO films with conductivity {sigma} &gt; 2000 S/cm can be grown for a broad range of metals compositions, In content from {approx}60 to {approx}85 cation%, as long as the corresponding optimal oxygen level is used in the deposition. The amount of oxygen required increases with increasing indium content. When too much oxygen is used, the conductivity is reduced due to a decreased carrier concentration whereas when too little oxygen is used, the conductivity is reduced due to decreased electron mobility. Concurrent with the decrease in electron mobility, there is increasing optical absorption from 400 nm to 1000 nm which renders the oxygen deficient a IZO samples grey.","","","National Renewable Energy Lab.

The natural band offsets were calculated taking into account the core-level deformation. Ternary alloy formation was explored through application of the special quasirandom structure method. The B3 structure is found to be stable over all (Zn,Cd)Te compositions, as expected from the preferences of ZnTe and CdTe.

It was shown that the splitting pattern is consistent with the previously proposed symmetry of NN1 defects and nonlinearities resulting from the reduction in the exciton binding energy. At high stresses, the NN1 lines disappeared due to the ionization of bound excitons.","","","National Renewable Energy Lab.

The group-IIIA delafossites have indirect band gaps with large differences between the direct and indirect band gaps. However, this difference is small for the group-IIIB delafossites: only 0.22 eV for CuScO{sub 2} and it diminishes further for CuYO{sub 2} and CuLaO{sub 2}. Also, whereas group IIIA prefers rhombohedral stacking, group IIIB stabilizes in hexagonal structures. We further find that CuScO{sub 2} has the highest calculated fundamental band gap among all the delafossite oxides. In addition, CuLaO{sub 2} is found to have a direct band gap. These differences are explained by the different atomic configurations between the group-IIIA and IIIB elements. Our understanding of these delafossites provides general guidance for proper selection of delafossites for suitable applications in optoelectronic devices.","","","National Renewable Energy Lab.

Here we demonstrate the fabrication of a-Si:H nanowires (NWs) and nanocones (NCs), using an easily scalable and IC-compatible process. We also investigate the optical properties of these nanostructures. These a-Si:H nanostructures display greatly enhanced absorption over a large range of wavelengths and angles of incidence, due to suppressed reflection. The enhancement effect is particularly strong for a-Si:H NC arrays, which provide nearly perfect impedance matching between a-Si:H and air through a gradual reduction of the effective refractive index. More than 90% of light is absorbed at angles of incidence up to 60{sup o} for a-Si:H NC arrays, which is significantly better than NW arrays (70%) and thin films (45%). In addition, the absorption of NC arrays is 88% at the band gap edge of a-Si:H, which is much higher than NW arrays (70%) and thin films (53%). Our experimental data agree very well with simulation.

"Solar Photovoltaics Wedge: Pathways for Growth and Potential Carbon Mitigation in the U.S.","Drury, E; Denholm, P; Margolis, R M","14 SOLAR ENERGY; 54 ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCES; CAPACITY; CARBON; ELECTRICITY; MANUFACTURING; MARKET; MITIGATION; Energy Analysis","The challenge of stabilizing global carbon emissions over the next 50 years has been framed in the context of finding seven 1.0 Gton C/year carbon reduction wedges. Solar photovoltaics (PV) could provide at least one carbon wedge, but will require significant growth in PV manufacturing capacity. The actual amount of installed PV capacity required to reach wedge-level carbon reductions will vary greatly depending on the mix of avoided fuels and the additional emissions from manufacturing PV capacity. In this work, we find that the US could reduce its carbon emissions by 0.25 Gton C/year, equal to the fraction of a global carbon wedge proportional to its current domestic electricity use, by installing 792-811 GW of PV capacity. We evaluate a series of PV growth scenarios and find that wedge-level reductions could be met by increasing PV manufacturing capacity and annual installations by 0.95 GW/year/year each year from 2009 to 2050 or by increasing up to 4 GW/year/year for a period of 4-17 years for early and late growth scenarios. This challenge of increasing PV manufacturing capacity and market demand is significant but not out of line with the recent rapid growth in both the global and US PV industry. We find that the rapid growth in PV manufacturing capacity leads to a short term increase in carbon emissions from the US electric sector. However, this increase is small, contributing less than an additional 0.3% to electric sector emissions for less than 4.5 years, alleviating recent concern regarding carbon emissions from rapid PV growth scenarios.","","","National Renewable Energy Lab.

By design, this type of radiometer can measure the; total hemispheric (global) or diffuse (sky) irradiance when the detector is unshaded or shaded from the sun disk, respectively. These measurements are used in a variety of applications including solar energy conversion, atmospheric studies, agriculture, and materials science. Proper calibration of pyranometers is essential to ensure measurement quality. This paper describes a step-by-step method for calculating and reporting the uncertainty of the calibration, using the guidelines of the ISO 'Guide to the Expression of Uncertainty in Measurement' or GUM, that is applied to the pyranometer; calibration procedures used at the National Renewable Energy Laboratory (NREL). The NREL technique; characterizes a responsivity function of a pyranometer as a function of the zenith angle, as well as reporting a single; calibration responsivity value for a zenith angle of 45 ..deg... The uncertainty analysis shows that a lower uncertainty can be achieved by using the response function of a pyranometer determined as a function of zenith angle, in lieu of just using; the average value at 45..deg... By presenting the contribution of each uncertainty source to the total uncertainty; users will be able to troubleshoot and improve their calibration process. The uncertainty analysis method can also be used to determine the uncertainty of different calibration techniques and applications, such as deriving the uncertainty of field measurements.","","","National Renewable Energy Lab.

The evolution of the nitrogen-concentration depth profile is consistent with liquid-phase diffusion, solute trapping at the rapidly moving solidification front, and surface evaporation. The reduction of the Schottky barrier height of the {Gamma}-like threshold at nitrogen composition up to x = 0.016 is studied by ballistic electron emission microscopy (BEEM) and determined quantitatively using the second voltage derivative BEEM spectra to be -191 {+-} 63 meV per x = 0.01, which is close to the corresponding slope for samples grown by low-temperature molecular beam epitaxy. This slope is also consistent with the bandgap narrowing measured on the same samples by photomodulated reflectance and is consistent with the band anticrossing model for the splitting of the conduction band in the GaN{sub x}As{sub 1-x} alloys. Lithographically patterned GaN{sub x}As{sub 1-x} dots are imaged by BEEM.

Its main idea is to introduce a partially occupied intermediate band (IB) between the valence band (VB) and conduction band (CB) of the semiconductor absorber, thereby increasing the photocurrent by the additional VB {yields} IB and IB {yields} CB absorptions. The confined electron levels of self-assembled quantum dots (QDs) were proposed as potential candidates for the implementation of such an IB. Here we report experimental and theoretical investigations on In{sub y}Ga{sub 1-y}As dots in a GaAs{sub 1-x}P{sub x} matrix, examining its suitability for acting as IBSCs. The system has the advantage of allowing strain symmetrization within the structure, thus enabling the growth of a large number of defect-free QD layers, despite the significant size mismatch between the dot material and the surrounding matrix. We examine the various conditions related to the optimum functionality of the IBSC, in particular those connected to the optical and electronic properties of the system. We find that the intensity of absorption between QD-confined electron states and host CB is weak because of their localized-to-delocalized character. Regarding the position of the IB within the matrix band gap, we find that, whereas strain symmetrization can indeed permit growth of multiple dot layers, the current repertoire of GaAs{sub 1-x}P{sub x} barrier materials, as well as In{sub y}Ga{sub 1-y} As dot materials, does not satisfy the ideal energetic locations for the IB. We conclude that other QD systems must be considered for QD-IBSC implementations.","","","National Renewable Energy Lab.

We further find that the random-alloy system is more favorable than the superlattice system in terms of light absorption in the longer-wavelength regions.

When not in use, they sit there discreetly among the lab equipment. But when a solar silicon wafer is placed inside one for processing, Sopori walks over to a computer and types in a temperature profile. Almost immediately this fires up the furnace, which glows inside and selectively heats up the silicon wafer to 800 degrees centigrade by the intense light it produces. Sopori, a principal engineer at the National Renewable Energy Laboratory, has been researching and developing optical furnace technology for around 20 years. He says it's a challenging technology to develop because there are many issues to consider when you process a solar cell, especially in optics. Despite the challenges, Sopori and his research team have advanced the technology to the point where it will benefit all solar cell manufacturers. They are now developing a commercial version of the furnace in partnership with a manufacturer. 'This advanced optical furnace is highly energy efficient, and it can be used to manufacture any type of solar cell,' he says. Each type of solar cell or manufacturing process typically requires a different furnace configuration and temperature profile. With NREL's new optical furnace system, a solar cell manufacturer can ask the computer for any temperature profile needed for processing a solar cell, and the same type of furnace is suitable for several solar cell fabrication process steps. 'In the future, solar cell manufacturers will only need this one optical furnace because it can be used for any process, including diffusion, metallization and oxidation,' Sopori says. 'This helps reduce manufacturing costs.' One startup company, Applied Optical Systems, has recognized the furnace's potential for manufacturing thin-film silicon cells. 'We'd like to develop thin-film silicon cells with higher efficiencies, up to 15 to 18 percent, and we believe this furnace will enable us to do so,' says A. Rangappan, founder and CEO of Applied Optical Systems. Rangappan also says it will take only a few minutes for the optical furnace to process a thin-film solar cell, which reduces manufacturing costs. Overall, he estimates the company's solar cell will cost around 80 cents per watt. For manufacturing these thin-film silicon cells, Applied Optical Systems and NREL have developed a partnership through a cooperative research and development agreement (CRADA) to construct an optical furnace system prototype. DOE is providing $500,000 from its Technology Commercialization Development Fund to help offset the prototype's development costs because of the technology's significant market potential. The program has provided the NREL technology transfer office with a total of $4 million to expand such collaborative efforts between NREL researchers and companies. Applied Optical will construct a small version of the optical furnace based on the prototype design in NREL's process development and integration laboratory through a separate CRADA. This small furnace will only develop one solar cell wafer at a time. Then, the company will construct a large, commercial-scale optical furnace at its own facilities, which will turn out around 1,000 solar cell wafers per hour. 'We hope to start using the optical furnace for manufacturing within four to five years,' Rangappan says. Meanwhile, another partnership using the optical furnace has evolved between NREL and SiXtron Advanced Materials, another startup. Together they'll use the optical furnace to optimize the metallization process for novel antireflective solar cell coatings. The process is not only expected to yield higher efficiencies for silicon-based solar cells, but also lowers processing costs and eliminates safety concerns for manufacturers. Most solar cell manufacturers currently use a plasma-enhanced chemical vapor deposition (PECVD) system with compressed and extremely pyrophoric silane gas (SiH4) for applying passivation antireflective coatings (ARC). If silane is exposed to air, the SiH4 will explode - a serious safety issue for high-volume manufacturers. SiXtron's process uses a solid, silicon-based polymer that's converted into noncompressed, nonexplosive gas, which then flows to a standard PECVD system. 'The solid source is so safe to handle that it can be shipped by FedEx,' says Zbigniew Barwicz, president and CEO of SiXtron. Barwicz says manufacturers can use the same PECVD processing equipment for the SiXtron process that they already use for SiH4, a plug-and-play solution. For this novel passivation ARC process, NREL is helping to optimize the metallization parameters. NREL has developed a new technology called optical processing. One of the applications of this process is fire-through contact formation of silicon solar cells.","","","National Renewable Energy Lab.

The conventional TCOs, such as Sn-doped In{sub 2}O{sub 3}, are crystalline single phase materials. Here, we report on In-Zn-O (IZO), a compositionally tunable amorphous TCO with some significantly improved properties. Compositionally graded thin film samples were deposited by co-sputtering from separate In{sub 2}O{sub 3} and ZnO targets onto glass substrates at 100 C. For the metals composition range of 55-84 cation% indium, the as-deposited IZO thin films are amorphous, smooth (R{sub RMS} &lt; 0.4 nm), conductive ({sigma} {approx} 3000 {Omega}{sup -1} {center_dot} cm{sup -1}), and transparent in the visible (T{sub Vis} &gt; 90%). Furthermore, the amorphous IZO thin films demonstrate remarkable functional and structural stability with respect to heating up to 600 C in either air or argon.

They found that polishing resulted in an amorphous layer on the surface and no Kikuchi pattern; however, ion-beam milling produced a relatively flat and good-quality surface, resulting in high-quality patterns and, consequently, excellent EBSD data. The authors used a combination of polishing and ion-beam milling or etching to study the crystalline structure of the CdTe film at different depths. They also used EBSD, in conjunction with other analytical techniques, to investigate the effects of the CdCl{sub 2} treatment, performed at different temperatures and times, on the recrystallization process of physical vapor deposition CdTe thin films. The authors found that the untreated films were &lt;111&gt; oriented, with grain sizes smaller than 1 {micro}m. The CdCl{sub 2} at 350 C produced partially recrystallized films, whereas treatments at 400 C or 420 C produced completely recrystallized films, with no texture, and grains with grain sizes varying from about 1 {micro}m to more than 40{micro}m. These films were so flat that good EBSD data could be obtained without any surface preparation. Atomic force microscopy and scanning electron microscopy showed that large grains had different morphologies than smaller grains, and EBSD showed that these large grains had &lt;111&gt; texture. These results indicate that the (111) surface is the lowest energy surface in these films and, consequently, &lt;111&gt;-oriented grains grow at the expense of grains oriented in less-favorable directions. Regardless of the deposition method and treatment, the CdTe films have a high density of 60{sup o} &lt;111&gt; twin boundaries.","","","National Renewable Energy Lab.

Wide-depletion-width devices generate significant photocurrent using a p-i-n structure grown by molecular beam epitaxy, but these depletion widths are only realized in a region of parameter space that leads to rough surface morphologies. Here, bismuth is explored as a surfactant for the growth of GaInNAs solar cells. Very low fluxes of Bi are effective at maintaining smooth surfaces, even at high growth temperatures and In contents. However, Bi also increases the net donor concentration in these materials, manifested in our n-on-p device structures as a pn-junction that moves deeper into the base layer with increasing Bi fluxes. Quantum efficiency modeling and scanning kelvin probe microscopy measurements confirm the type conversion of the base layer from p type to n type. Bi incorporation in GaAsBi samples shows signs of surface segregation, leading to a finite buildup time, and this effect may lead to slow changes in the electrical properties of the GaInNAs(Bi) devices. Bi also appears to create a defect level, although this defect level is not deleterious enough to increase the dark current in the devices.","","","National Renewable Energy Lab.

This article focuses on further understanding the conditions and mechanisms by which these Ca impurities incorporate. Plasma-assisted molecular-beam epitaxy utilizing a 1% N{sub 2} in Ar precursor gas mixture was used to grow GaAs at 400 and 580 C, and GaN{sub 0.01}As{sub 0.99} at 400 C. Two plasma operating combinations of rf power and gas flow rate were used to generate different amounts and energies of both ions and other plasma species, while keeping nitrogen incorporation constant. The ions were characterized with a dual-grid, retarding-field ion energy analyzer, and the corresponding ion energy distributions are presented to correlate ions with Ca incorporation. When appropriate, dc-biased deflector plates were used to remove ions during growth. Secondary ion mass spectrometry was used to measure Ca in GaAs and GaN{sub 0.01}As{sub 0.99}. Ca incorporation was observed in the dilute nitride samples, but the effects of ions did not exceed other Ca incorporation mechanisms associated with defects due to both low temperature growth and nitrogen incorporation; however, different neutral active nitrogen species (atomic N and metastable N{sub 2}) may be a factor. Ca incorporation measured in GaAs grown at 400 C with a pure Ar plasma is predominantly due to defects associated with low temperature growth, as opposed to plasma damage caused by the ions. GaAs growths at 580 C without a plasma did not exhibit Ca incorporation, but growth at 580 C with ions from a pure Ar plasma caused Ca incorporation.","","","National Renewable Energy Lab.

The transferable SiNMs are realized by first growing pseudomorphic SiGe and Si layers on silicon-on-insulator (SOI) substrates, and then, selectively removing the buried oxide (BOX) layer from the SOI. Before the release, only the SiGe layer is compressively strained. Upon release, part of the compressive strain in the SiGe layer is transferred to the thin Si layers, and the Si layers, thus, become tensile strained. Both the initial compressive strain state in the SiGe layer and the final strain sharing state between the SiGe and the Si layers are verified with X-ray diffraction measurements. The TFTs are fabricated employing the conventional high-temperature MOS process on the strain-shared SiNMs that are transferred to an oxidized Si substrate. The transferred strained-sharing SiNMs show outstanding thermal stability and can withstand the high-temperature TFT process on the new host substrate. The strained-channel TFTs fabricated on the new host substrate show high current drive capability and an average electron effective mobility of 270 cm{sup 2}/V ldr s. The results suggest that transferable and thermally stable single-crystal elastically strain- sharing SiNMs can serve as excellent active material for high-speed device application with a simple and scalable transfer method. The demonstration of MOS TFTs on the transferable nanomembranes may create the opportunity for future high-speed Si CMOS heterogeneous integration on any substrate.","","","National Renewable Energy Lab.

We found that Si nanocrystallites in the intrinsic and weakly P-doped materials aggregate to form cone-shaped structures. The local work function of the nanocrystalline aggregation areas is larger than the surrounding amorphous areas. Increasing the P-doping level requires an increased hydrogen dilution to reach the similar Raman crystallinity. The nanocrystalline aggregation disappears in the heavily P-doped materials, but isolated nanocrystallites appear. The effect of P-doping on the nanostructure is explained with the coverage of P-related radicals on the existing nanocrystalline surface during the deposition and the P segregation in grain boundaries, which prevent new nucleation on the surface of existing nanocrystallites.","","","National Renewable Energy Lab.

An analytical expression is derived for the time-dependent diffusion coefficient of electrons, which transforms at a characteristic (Fermi) time from strongly time-dependent values (dispersive transport) at short times to relatively time-independent values (nondispersive transport) at long times. At short times, the diffusion coefficient displays a power-law behavior with time. The timescale for the diffusion coefficient to reach its steady-state value is substantially longer than the Fermi time. The Fermi time and the steepness of the distribution of waiting times associated with trap sites have a strong influence on both the steady-state diffusion coefficient of electrons and on the dispersiveness of electron transport. At short timescales, ionic drag, associated with the ambipolar effect, slows electron transport through the TiO{sub 2} matrix, whereas at steady state, transport is trap limited. Decreasing the electron density lowers the steady-state limit of the diffusion coefficient and increases the timescale over which transport is dispersive.","","","National Renewable Energy Lab.

Tungsten oxide (WO{sub 3}) has emerged as one of the key materials, not only for EC devices, but also for many other related applications. After many years of technology development efforts, WO{sub 3}-based EC 'smart windows' have finally emerged as a viable commercial product. In spite of enormous progress being made on the structural, electrical, and optical properties of amorphous and crystalline WO{sub 3}, a detailed understanding of the EC effect in this material still remains somewhat qualitative. Although theoretical models based on intervalence charge transfer and polaron formation have been widely accepted, these models are still unable to explain some of the experimental results on the coloration phenomena. The coloration in WO{sub 3} is a structure-sensitive phenomenon, and excess electrons can be either localized or delocalized. The presence of structural defects such as oxygen vacancies, impurities, and degree of disorder plays a crucial role in determining the coloration efficiency. Although significant progress has been made in recent years on the calculation of electronic structure and defect properties of both amorphous and crystalline WO{sub 3}, the structural complexity of the material presents many challenges and opportunities for theoretical computation. The unique ability to induce bistable optical and electrical properties in WO{sub 3} by a variety of excitation sources has led to many devices of significant technological interest. Some of the applications currently being pursued include the photoelectrochemical cell for solar energy conversion and storage; photoelectrochemical splitting of water to generate hydrogen; chemical and biological sensors based on the gasochromic effect; photo- and electrocatalysts for a variety of chemical reactions; demonstration of high-temperature (91 K) superconductivity in WO{sub 3} doped with H, Na, and K; synthesis of a new class of hybrid organic/inorganic (WO{sub 3}) materials; and application in ultra-high-resolution electron beam lithography. The emergence of nanostructured WO{sub 3} in recent years will undoubtedly provide new opportunities and significant impact to many of these technologies. This paper presents a brief overview of some of the key research issues the author believes will impact the science and technology of this exciting material.","","","National Renewable Energy Lab.

The assumption is that the steady-state intrinsic photoluminescence at 1.09 eV (1.134 {micro}m) can be related to the recombination lifetime. In this work, we measured the band-edge photoluminescence (PL) intensities of a number of single-crystal wafers. The resistivity in the wafer set ranges from 1 to 11,000 ohm-cm under constant excitation intensity. We then measured the PL spectra and recombination lifetimes of these wafer sets under a variety of conditions. The lifetime was measured using resonant-coupled photoconductive decay (RCPCD) in both air ambient and an iodine/methanol solution. The same procedure was used for the PL spectra. Plots of the measured lifetime versus the PL intensity showed weak correlation between the two quantities in air ambient. However, there is a positive relationship between the near-bandgap PL intensity and the recombination lifetime for passivated surfaces. Some fundamental physical reasons will be used to explain these results.","","","National Renewable Energy Lab.

Different solvents and solvent/non-solvent mixtures were also studied. The FTIR imaging system allowed acquisition of sequential images of the CAB films as solvent penetration proceeded without disturbing the system. The interface between the non-swollen polymer and the initial swelling front could be identified using multivariate data analysis tools. For a series of ketone solvents the initial diffusion coefficients and diffusion rates could be quantified and were found to be related to the polar and hydrogen interaction parameters in the Hansen solubility parameters of the solvents. For the solvent/non-solvent system the initial diffusion rate decreased less than linearly with the weight-percent of non-solvent present in the solution, which probably was due to the swelling characteristic of the non-solvent. For a given solvent, increasing the butyryl content of the CAB increased the initial diffusion rate. Increasing the butyryl content from 17 wt.% butyryl to 37 wt.% butyryl produced a considerably larger increase in initial diffusion rate compared to an increase in butyryl content from 37 wt.% to 50 wt.% butyryl.","","","National Renewable Energy Lab.

The sublinear relationship between the photogenerated hole density and the incident light intensity, in both the neat polymer and the donor-acceptor blend, can be attributed to the quenching of excitons by holes, at a rate characterized by a second-order rate constant ({gamma}{sub 2}) of 3 x 10{sup -8} cm{sup 3}/s. This value is larger than that found for other, luminescent conjugated polymers; the difference may be attributed to a greater collision probability, due to the higher mobility of the interacting species, or to an enhancement of the quenching rate once they are in close proximity.

The active layer was a standard blend of poly(3-hexylthiophene) and [6-6]-phenyl C61-butyric acid methyl ester. Over 100 devices were fabricated and measured to obtain good statistics. Ba/Al and Ca/Al electrodes performed best, with similar open-circuit voltages and power conversion efficiencies. Device stability studies showed devices with these two electrodes remained similar after six weeks with degradation of 11%-16% in net conversion efficiency observed.

Despite a number of experimental attempts to realize this concept, no efficiency improvement over conventional single-junction solar cells has so far been demonstrated. This is likely due to the fact that the intermediate band itself acts to enhance electron-hole recombination. In this work we propose a novel intermediate-band solar-cell architecture based on doped semiconductor nanostructures having an inverted type-I band alignment with the surrounding host. The recombination of carriers in the nanostructures is prevented by ultra-fast charge transfer to the host, thereby removing the main obstacle to achieve high conversion efficiency.","","","National Renewable Energy Lab.

Comparative characterization of nanocrystal films made by spin-coating and by the LbL process shows that EDT quantitatively displaces oleic acid on the PbSe surface, causing a large volume loss that electronically couples the nanocrystals while severely degrading their positional and crystallographic order of the films. Field-effect transistors based on EDT-treated films are moderately conductive and ambipolar in the dark, becoming p-type and 30-60 times more conductive under 300 mW cm{sup -2} broadband illumination.

Both for cw and for laser pulse exposures, the early-time kinetics follows sublinear t{sup {beta}} time dependences, similar to the long-time limit. In addition, the overall defect creation rate is not a single function of the total defect number. Instead, it depends on the thermal stability, or annealing energy distribution, of the defects present in the film. Furthermore, creation of the thermally less stable defects is unaffected by the presence of a large number of stable defects introduced by pre-exposure at a higher temperature. These findings question the existing defect creation models. Thermal stability of the light-induced defects depends on the network microstructure, the less stable defects being created in a-Si:H deposited near microcrystalline transition.","","","National Renewable Energy Lab.

In the intrinsic and weakly P-doped (3 x 10{sup 18}at/cm{sup 3}) films, the nanocrystallites aggregate to cone-shaped structures. Conductive atomic force microscopy images showed high current flows through the nanocrystalline cones and a distinct two-phase structure in the micrometer range. Adding PH{sub 3} into the processing gas moved the amorphous/nanocrystalline transition to a higher hydrogen dilution ratio required for achieving a similar Raman crystallinity. In a heavily P-doped (2 x 10{sup 21} at/cm{sup 3}) film, the nanocrystalline aggregation disappeared, where isolated grains of nanometer sizes were distributed throughout the amorphous matrix. The heavily doped mixed-phase film with 5-10% crystal volume fraction showed a dramatic increase in conductivity. We offer an explanation for the nanocrystalline cone formation based on atomic hydrogen enhanced surface diffusion model, and propose that the coverage of P-related radicals on the existing nanocrystalline surface during film growth and the P segregation in grain boundaries are responsible for preventing new nucleation on the surface of the existing nanocrystallites, resulting in nanocrystallites dispersed throughout the amorphous matrix.","","","National Renewable Energy Lab.

The CdS domains were grown directly on the surface of the oxide by a chemical bath deposition method. Mobile charge carriers are generated with a low yield following photoexcitation of CdS grown on ZrO{sub 2}; there is no injection into the oxide and the short-lived photoconductance signal is attributed to the hole in CdS. In contrast, illumination of CdS domains grown on TiO{sub 2} results in very efficient electron injection into the TiO{sub 2} nanoparticles, producing long-lived charge carriers. We show that the quantum yield for electron injection into TiO{sub 2} per photon absorbed by the CdS sensitizer is close to unity. The photoconductance action spectrum follows the absorption of the CdS domains, which indicates that the charge injection efficiency does not depend on wavelength in the range where the CdS absorbs (425-550 nm).","","","National Renewable Energy Lab.

The microstructure of these polycrystalline Si films is bimodal, with near defect-free regions of (001) orientation along the growth direction and highly defective regions containing smaller grains of (111) orientation. In the defective regions, the dominant structural defects are twins in the seed layer and stacking faults in the IAD-grown epitaxial layer, both lying on (111) planes. The stacking faults originate at the seed layer surface due to surface imperfections, indicating that the quality of the seed layer surface plays an important role for the quality of the epitaxial Si film. We find a clear correlation between the structural crystal quality and defect-related radiative transitions at sub-bandgap wavelengths. Two dominant defect levels ({approx} 0.20 eV and {approx} 0.29 eV below the conduction band edge) are observed and identified as impurity-related.","","","National Renewable Energy Lab.

We have also considered transition-metal atom impurities and some codoping approaches in WO{sub 3}. We find that, in general, band gap reduction was a common result due to the formation of impurity bands in the band gap. Also, the changes of band-edge positions, valence-band maxima and conduction-band minima, were found to depend on the electronic properties of the foreign atom and their concentration. Our results therefore provide guidance for making WO3 a suitable candidate for photoelectrodes for hydrogen generation by water splitting.","","","National Renewable Energy Lab.

This study provides insights into the underlying physics of the alloy system in two important phases - disordered and CuPt ordered - and the interplay of alloying and ordering effects. It also offers much-needed guidance for the optimal use of ordering phenomenon in a range of applications including telecommunications, photovoltaics, and solid-state lighting. Critical-point energies, interband transition matrix elements, and optical anisotropy are calculated for both the disordered and ordered phases. The deviation of the wave function of an alloy state from that of a virtual-crystal state is analyzed using a spectral function. The implications of such deviation are examined explicitly for the above-mentioned properties. Unusual ordering effects are revealed in the indirect-band-gap composition region of the alloy. The connection and distinction between the ordered and disordered structures are discussed. An often-used perturbation theory, known as 'a quasicubic model', is found to be reasonably accurate for predicting the anisotropy of the interband transition but inadequate for predicting the intensity variation with varying order parameter.","","","National Renewable Energy Lab.

Recently, colloidal semiconductor nanocrystals and nanocrystal films have been shown to exhibit efficient multiple electron-hole pair generation from a single photon with energy greater than twice the effective band gap. This multiple carrier pair process, referred to as multiple exciton generation (MEG), represents one route to reducing the thermal loss in semiconductor solar cells and may lead to the development of low cost, high efficiency solar energy devices. We review the current experimental and theoretical understanding of MEG, and provide views to the near-term future for both fundamental research and the development of working devices which exploit MEG.","","","National Renewable Energy Lab.

The results suggest that the main resistance in the SWNT thin films is the resistance associated with tube-tube junctions. Redox dopants are found to increase the delocalized carrier density and transmission probability through intertube junctions more effectively for semiconductor-enriched films than for metal-enriched films.

Like the dilute nitrides the dilute bismides show a giant band gap bowing effect in which a small concentration of the alloying element has a disproportionate effect on the band gap, however in the case of the bismide the band gap reduction is associated with an increase in the energy of the valence band maximum (VBM) rather than a reduction in the energy of the conduction band minimum (CBM). Under standard GaAs growth conditions Bi acts as a surfactant with associated improvements in surface quality. In order to incorporate Bi, growth temperatures below 400 C are used with As{sub 2}/Ga flux ratios close to unity. The electron mobility of GaAs is only weakly affected by Bi alloying, in contrast to the dilute nitrides where the electron mobility decreases rapidly with N alloying. Bi alloying also produces a giant bowing effect in the spin orbit splitting in the valence band. Strong room temperature photoluminescence is observed. Prospects for future device applications of this new compound semiconductor alloy are discussed.","","","National Renewable Energy Lab.

The choice of Raman excitation wavelength and sample preparation conditions allows differences to be observed for complexes involving metallic (m) and semiconducting (s) species. Adsorbed CaHydI can reversibly inject electronic charge into the LUMOs of s-SWNTs, while charge can be injected and removed from m-SWNTs at lower potentials just above the Fermi energy. Time-dependent enzymatic assays demonstrated that the reduced and oxidized forms of CaHydI are deactivated by oxygen, but at rates that varied by an order of magnitude. The time evolution of the oxidative decay of the CaHydI activity reveals different time constants when complexed with m-SWNTs and s-SWNTs. The correlation of enzymatic assays with time-dependent Raman spectroscopy provides a novel method by which the charge transfer interactions may be investigated in the various SWNT-CaHydI complexes. Surprisingly, an oxidized form of CaHydI is apparently more resistant to oxygen deactivation when complexed to m-SWNTs rather than s-SWNTs.","","","National Renewable Energy Lab.

Theoretical efficiencies of &gt;60% are described for many approaches, but there is often confusion about the theoretical efficiency for a specific structure. The detailed balance approach to calculating theoretical efficiency gives an upper bound that can be independent of material parameters and device design. Other models predict efficiencies that are closer to those that have been achieved. Changing reference spectra and the choice of concentration further complicate comparison of theoretical efficiencies.

"Determining the Internal Quantum Efficiency of PbSe Nanocrystal Solar Cells with the Aid of an Optical Model","Law, M; Beard, M C; Choi, S; Luther, J M; Hanna, M C; Nozik, A J","14 SOLAR ENERGY; 77 NANOSCIENCE AND NANOTECHNOLOGY; ABSORPTION; DITHIOLS; ELLIPSOMETRY; EXCITONS; OPTICAL MODELS; PHOTOCURRENTS; PHOTONS; QUANTUM EFFICIENCY; RECOMBINATION; REFRACTIVE INDEX; SOLAR CELLS; SPECTRA; THIN FILMS; Chemical and Biosciences","We determine the internal quantum efficiency (IQE) of the active layer of PbSe nanocrystal (NC) back-contact Schottky solar cells by combining external quantum efficiency (EQE) and total reflectance measurements with an optical model of the device stack. The model is parameterized with the complex index of refraction of each layer in the stack as calculated from ellipsometry data. Good agreement between the experimental and modeled reflectance spectra permits a quantitative estimate of the fraction of incident light absorbed by the NC films at each wavelength, thereby yielding well-constrained QE spectra for photons absorbed only by the NCs. Using a series of devices fabricated from 5.1 {+-} 0.4 nm diameter PbSe NCs, we show that thin NC cells achieve an EQE and an active layer IQE as high as 60 {+-} 5% and 80 {+-} 7%, respectively, while the QE of devices with NC layers thicker than about 150 nm falls, particularly in the blue, because of progressively greater light absorption in the field-free region of the films and enhanced recombination overall. Our results demonstrate that interference effects must be taken into account in order to calculate accurate optical generation profiles and IQE spectra for these thin film solar cells. The mixed modeling/experimental approach described here is a rigorous and powerful way to determine if multiple exciton generation (MEG) photocurrent is collected by devices with EQE &lt; 100%. On the basis of the magnitudes and shapes of the IQE spectra, we conclude that the 1,2-ethanedithiol treated NC devices studied here do not produce appreciable MEG photocurrent.","","","National Renewable Energy Lab.

"The Locus of Free Charge-Carrier Generation in Solution-Cast Zn1–xMgxO/Poly(3-hexylthiophene) Bilayers for Photovoltaic Applications","Piris, J.; Kopidakis, N.; Olson, D. C.; Shaheen, S. E.; Ginley, D. S.; Rumbles, G.","14 SOLAR ENERGY; 59 BASIC BIOLOGICAL SCIENCES; organic photovoltaic devices; photoconductivity","The photoconductivity of solution-cast Zn<sub>1–x</sub>Mg<sub>x</sub>O (x=0-0.4) and poly(3-hexylthiophene) (P3HT) thin films, and Zn<sub>1-x</sub>Mg<sub>x</sub>O/P3HT bilayers is investigated using Time-Resolved Microwave Conductivity (TRMC) with the aim of determining the locus of free charge carrier generation in the bilayer system. The photoconductivity of Zn<sub>1-x</sub>Mg<sub>x</sub>O thin films, under illumination with 300 nm laser pulses, is limited by the formation of stable excitons and by scattering of the carriers at grain boundaries. The electron mobility in Zn<sub>1–x</sub>Mg<sub>x</sub>O films decreases exponentially with Mg concentration, up to x=0.4. In agreement with previous work, free carriers are observed in the P3HT film under illumination with 500 nm pulses in the absence of an acceptor. Under illumination with 500 nm pulses, where only the polymer absorbs, the TRMC signal for the Zn<sub>1-x</sub>Mg<sub>x</sub>O/P3HT bilayers for x≥0.2 is the same as that of pure P3HT, indicating that free carrier generation in these bilayers occurs predominately by exciton dissociation in the polymer bulk, and not at the interface between the polymer and the solution-cast oxide. At lower Mg concentrations (x<0.2) the TRMC signal increases with decreasing x following the dependence of the electron mobility in the oxide but its light intensity dependence remains consistent with free carrier generation in the polymer bulk. To explain these results and previously published photovoltaic device data (Adv. Funct. Mater. 2007, 17, 264) we propose that free carrier generation in the bilayers predominantly occurs in the bulk of P3HT, and is followed by electron injection to the oxide to yield photocurrent in photovoltaic cells. The dependence of the TRMC signal of the bilayers on Mg concentration is explained in terms of the yield for free carrier generation in the polymer and the relative contributions of electrons in the oxide and holes in the polymer.","Wiley","","National Renewable Energy Lab.

However, our first-principles density-functional theory calculations reveal that, surprisingly, GBs in CuInSe{sub 2} (CIS) do not follow the classic GB model: GBs in CIS do not create deep levels due to the large atomic relaxation in GB regions. Thus, unlike the classic GB model, GBs in CIS are electrically benign, which explains the long-standing puzzling fact that polycrystalline CIS solar cells with remarkable efficiency can be achieved without deliberate GB passivation. This benign electrical character of GBs in CIS is confirmed by our scanning Kelvin probe microscopy measurements on Cu(In,Ga)Se{sub 2} chalcopyrite films.","","","National Renewable Energy Lab.

The transverse electric mode of the edge-emitted PL showed about 5° deviation from the sample surface for the dots grown on (311)B GaAs.

Samples grown without ions and with a higher proportion of atomic N resulted in the best overall material quality, although this improvement was observed at high annealing temperatures. At lower annealing temperatures, increased blueshifts were observed for samples grown with a higher proportion of atomic N; however, there was no noticeable influence of ions on blueshift regardless of whether atomic N or metastable N*2N2* was the dominant species present in the plasma.

The H2O2 treatment also results in a reduction of the high-energy absorption background that has been associated with either carbonaceous impurities or the SWNT π-plasmon oscillation. An understanding of the related mechanisms leads to a new method for separating nanotubes by type based on selective oxidation followed by selective precipitation. These findings offer the possibility of efficiently separating large quantities of nanotubes by chirality.","American Chemical Society","","National Renewable Energy Lab.

"The Effect of Atmosphere and ZnO Morphology on the Performance of Hybrid Poly(3-hexylthiophene)/ZnO Nanofiber Photovoltaic Devices","Olson, Dana C.; Shaheen, Sean E.; Collins, Reuben T.; Ginley, David S.","14 SOLAR ENERGY; 77 NANOSCIENCE AND NANOTECHNOLOGY; photovoltaic devices; fabrication; characterization; morphology; nanofibers","We present detailed investigations of the fabrication and characterization of photovoltaic devices consisting of poly(3-hexylthiophene) (P3HT) intercalated into a mesoporous structure of ZnO nanofibers. ZnO nanofibers were grown via a low-temperature hydrothermal route from a solution of zinc nitrate precursor. P3HT was spin-coated on top of the structure, and intercalation into the voids between the nanofibers was induced with annealing. A silver electrode was used as the top contact. Spin-coating, storage, and testing of the device were performed in air. We discuss the effects of atmosphere and ZnO nanofiber morphology on device performance. Optimized nanofiber devices exhibited a 4-fold increase in the short circuit current (2.17 mA/cm<sup>2</sup>) as compared to that of a planar ZnO-P3HT bilayer device (0.52 mA/cm<sup>2</sup>) as a result of the increased donor-acceptor interfacial area. The efficiency of the nanofiber based device under 1 sun-simulated solar illumination was 0.53% and was found to increase at higher incident light intensities, reaching a value of 0.61% at 2.5 suns. Additionally, we found that for these devices fabrication in and exposure to air is required to obtain good diode characteristics. We also show that the morphology of the ZnO nanostructures in the nanocomposite directly impacts device performance. Treatment of the ZnO surface using surfactants increased the open circuit voltage at the expense of the short circuit current; however, there was little effect on overall device efficiency. Because of the inverted geometry of this device that allowed for the use of a silver top contact, the device was not susceptible to oxidative degradation when stored in the dark.","American Chemical Society","","National Renewable Energy Lab.

P.","14 SOLAR ENERGY; 59 BASIC BIOLOGICAL SCIENCES; organic photovoltaic devices","Effective infiltration of the polymer into the nanostructured oxide is critical for optimizing the performance of hybrid π-conjugated polymer/nanostructured metal oxide semiconductor photovoltaic devices. We investigated the effect of polymer processing parameters, solvent selection, and thermal annealing on poly(3-hexylthiophene) (P3HT)/ZnO nanorod photovoltaic devices and found that these play an important role in the degree of polymer infiltration and the subsequent device performance. We demonstrate that using dichlorobenzene as a solvent produced better performance devices than using chloroform. In addition, the infiltration of P3HT into the ZnO nanorod array has been improved through annealing and subsequent slow cooling. Time-resolved microwave conductivity studies reveal an increase in the photoconductivity of the composite devices with annealing, resulting from changes in both the polymer and ZnO. The device performance was shown to increase with enhanced infiltration, and the devices that had been slow cooled from melt at 225 °C demonstrated a VOC of 440 mV, a JSC of 1.33 mA/cm2, a fill factor of 48%, and a power conversion efficiency of 0.28%. In contrast to previously published results on P3HT infiltrated into mesoporous TiO2 (Appl. Phys. Lett. 2003, 83, 3380), we found that the device performance improves with increasing amount of the polymer embedded in the ZnO arrays, through proper solvent selection and polymer processing.","American Chemical Society","","National Renewable Energy Lab.

Spectra of external quantum efficiency (EQE) are measured and analyzed with a one-dimensional exciton diffusion model dependent upon the complex optical functions of pentacene films, which are measured by spectroscopic ellipsometry. An improvement in EQE is observed when the thickness of the bathocuproine (BCP) layer is decreased from 12 nm to 6 nm. Detailed analysis of the EQE spectra indicates that large exciton diffusion lengths in the pentacene films are responsible for the overall high EQE values near wavelengths of 668 nm. Analysis also shows that improvement in the EQE of devices with the thinner BCP layer can be attributed to a net gain in optical field distribution and improvement in carrier collection efficiency. An improvement in open-circuit voltage (VOC) is also achieved through a thermal annealing process, leading to a net increase in power conversion efficiency. Integration of the EQE spectrum with an AM1.5 G spectrum yields a predicted power conversion efficiency of 1.8 ± 0.2%. The increase in VOC is attributed to a significant reduction in the diode reverse saturation current upon annealing.","Elsevier","","National Renewable Energy Lab.

At H2 coverages ≤3 H2/B, a clear splitting is observed for the H2 rotation transition peak at about 14.7 meV in all arc-produced samples. In contrast, the spectra from laser-produced materials exhibit one broad peak. Further increase in H2 coverage results in adsorption at lower binding energy sites. No distinct signature of an enhanced boron–hydrogen interaction is observed. However, the overall line width of the rotation transition peak from a laser-produced sample is substantially smaller than that from arc-prepared samples. This difference might imply that some features of the H2 rotation transition peak might not be due to the intrinsic features of single wall carbon nanotubes.","Elsevier","","National Renewable Energy Lab.

These changes are quantitatively described by microtexture analysis, a spatial distribution of the orientation of the grains. The analysis is performed in a scanning electron microscope by means of identification of the electron back-scattered diffraction patterns from individual grains. The texture of each grain, the misorientation between grains, and coincident site lattice boundary maps are obtained. The results show that the CdCl2 treatment did not promote significant microstructural changes in HT-CdTe films, which grow with large and randomly oriented grains, and with a predominance of high-angle boundaries. On the other hand, for LT-CdTe films, this treatment promotes a substantial increase in grain size, a decreasing of preferential orientation, and an increase in the number of CSL and high-angle boundaries. These changes are considered to be a strong evidence for recrystallization.","Springer","","National Renewable Energy Lab.

Here, the authors focus on better understanding the conditions by which Ca is incorporated into GaInNAs. Various material combinations were grown including GaAs, InGaAs, GaInNAs, and Al(Ga)As. The materials were primarily grown by solid-source molecular-beam epitaxy (MBE) at {approx}400 and 580--620 C, with comparisons made to metal-organic chemical vapor deposition (MOCVD)-grown materials where appropriate. Calcium incorporation was measured through secondary ion mass spectrometry. There was no measurable Ca incorporation into MBE-grown GaAs at 580 C, but Ca incorporates into GaAs at low MBE growth temperatures ({approx}400 C) that are comparable to those typically used for GaInNAs. This suggests that the N species is not solely responsible for the observed Ca incorporation into MBE-grown GaInNAs; but rather, defects associated with the low temperature growth may also be a factor. The effects of defect-related Ca incorporation were further studied at interfaces between Al(Ga)As and GaAs, and substrates pretreated with an O2 plasma and NH4OH etch. Ca incorporation was observed at the interface between Al0.3Ga0.7As/GaAs, AlAs/GaAs, and at the epilayer/substrate interface for the pretreated samples. No Ca was observed in InGaAs samples grown by either MBE or MOCVD, suggesting the Ca incorporation into GaInNAs has something to do with the addition of nitrogen. Therefore, the authors propose that the likely causes of Ca incorporation into GaInNAs are a Ca--N affinity, defects generated by low temperature growth, defects generated by the incorporation of N into GaAs, or some combination thereof.","","","National Renewable Energy Lab.

High-quality thin films of the dichalcogenides were prepared using new soluble precursors, (CH{sub 3}NH{sub 3}){sub 2}MS{sub 4} (M = Mo, W). The precursors were dissolved in organic solvents and spun onto substrates via both single- and multistep spin coating procedures. The thin films were formed by the thermal decomposition of the coatings under inert atmosphere. Structural, electrical, optical absorption, thermal, and transport properties of the thin films were characterized. Surface morphology of the films was analyzed by atomic force microscopy and scanning electron microscopy. Highly conductive and textured n-type MoS{sub 2} films were obtained. The measured room temperature conductivity {approx}50 O-1 cm-1 is substantially higher than the previously reported values. The n-type WS{sub 2} films were prepared for the first time using solution-processed deposition.

The biaxial stress and strain grown into this highly lattice-mismatched junction can be controlled by varying the design of a step-graded Ga{sub x}In{sub 1-x}P buffer layer, in which most, but not all, of the 1.9% misfit strain is relieved. A multi-beam optical stress sensor (MOSS) is a convenient tool for in situ measurement of stress during metal-organic vapor phase epitaxy (MOVPE) for the optimization of solar cell performance. The analysis of stress from curvature data is complicated by significant temperature effects due to relatively small thermal gradients in our atmospheric-pressure MOVPE reactor. These temperature effects are discussed and approximations made to allow practical analysis of the data. The results show excellent performance of inverted In{sub .27}Ga{sub .73}. As solar cells grown with slight compressive stress, but degradation under tensile stress. The best devices had a V{sub oc} of 0.54 V and a dislocation density in the low 10{sup 6} cm{sup -2}.

"A proposed working standard for the measurement of diffuse horizontal shortwave irradiance","Michalsky, J. J.; Gueymard, C.; Kiedron, P.; McArthur, L. J. B.; Philipona, R.; Stoffel, T.","14 SOLAR ENERGY; 47 OTHER INSTRUMENTATION; 54 ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCES; diffuse irradiance; working standard; pyranometer","Atmospheric radiative transfer model estimates of diffuse horizontal broadband shortwave (solar) irradiance have historically been larger than measurements from a shaded pyranometer. A reference standard for the diffuse horizontal shortwave irradiance does not exist. There are no current efforts to develop an absolute standard that are known to the authors. This paper presents the case for a working standard for this measurement. Four well-behaved pyranometers from two previous intensive observation periods (IOP) were chosen for this study. The instruments were characterized for spectral and angular response before the IOP and calibrated during the IOP using a shade/unshade technique with reference direct irradiance from an absolute cavity radiometer. The results of the comparison and detailed analyses to explain the differences suggest selecting three of the four for the working standard. The 95% confidence uncertainty in this standard is estimated at 2.2% of reading + 0.2 W/m<sup>2</sup>. In lieu of a comparison to this trio, a procedure for obtaining low-uncertainty diffuse horizontal shortwave irradiance is suggested.","American Geophysical Union","","National Renewable Energy Lab.

The CuxTe primary back contact was formed by evaporating a Cu layer with various thicknesses at room temperature on HNO3/H3PO4 (NP) solution etched CdTe layer. A post-annealing was then followed. The structural evolution and electrical properties of CuxTe were investigated. Cu/Te ratio and post-annealing temperature are two processing parameters in this study. The CuxTe phases are mainly controlled by the Cu/Te ratio. After a post-annealing at a low temperature, such as 100 C, no CuxTe phase transformation from its as-deposited phase was observed. A post-annealing treatment at a higher temperature, such as 250 C, can reveal the stoichiometric CuxTe phases based on the Cu/Te ratio used in the devices. But a post-annealing at a further higher temperature, such as 400 C, resulted in a complicated CuxTe phase appearance. CuTe, Cu1.4Te, and Cu2Te are three major phases detected by X-ray diffraction (XRD) for different Cu thickness application annealed at 250 C. Application of Cu thicker than 60 nm degrades open-circuit voltage (Voc) and shunting resistance (Rsh), but increases series resistance (Rs). The correlation between device performance and the CuxTe back contact illustrates that the process used for forming the Cu2Te back contact failed to produce good fill factor (FF) and also introduced higher barrier height. The best device was observed for a back contact with a mixed Cu1.4Te and CuTe phases.","","","National Renewable Energy Lab.

After thermal annealing in a He atmosphere at 250 C for 30 min, recrystallization, coalescence, and agglomeration of grains were observed. We further found that nanovoids formed in the annealed ITO thin films. The majority of the nanovoids are distributed along the locations of the original grain boundaries.

Auger electron spectroscopy measurements indicate that copper-telluride films are formed at the substrate surface that have a 2:1 Cu-to-Te ratio, as predicted by the Cu--Te phase diagram. When these films are annealed above about 700 K in vacuum, Te desorbs from the substrate with zero-order kinetics. An analysis of Te-desorption traces that assumes the reaction Cu{sub 2}Te(s) {yields} 2Cu(s) + {alpha}Te(?) + 1/2(1 - {alpha})Te2({nu}) finds a thermal-decomposition activation energy of 217 {+-} 3 kJ mol{sup -1}.

We find that individual lamellar twins and stacking faults do not create deep levels in all these materials. However, areas with high density of these defects can form buried wurtzite layers that introduce a barrier to the majority carriers. Double-positioning twin boundaries, which contain dislocation cores, create deep levels in Si and CdTe. Surprisingly, however, they do not create deep levels in CuInSe{sub 2}. These results may explain the fact that Si and CdTe solar cells usually require special passivation, whereas CuInSe{sub 2} solar cells do not. Our further study on the passivation effects indicates that grain boundaries in Si cannot be passivated completely by H alone. On the other hand, grain boundaries in CdTe can be passivated well by Cl and I.","","","National Renewable Energy Lab.

A monotonic increase of the photoluminescence lifetime with decreasing temperature is observed. The external strain induced by lowering the temperature below the freezing point of the solution leads to an overall lowering of the photoluminescence lifetime. This effect indicates that the measured lifetime is defined by the intrinsic electronic properties of carbon nanotubes and could be understood as an exchange interaction between bright and dark excitonic states. We find the lifetime to vary between 223 and 319 ps between 290 and 5 K, obtained by a multiexponential fit, well in agreement with previous experiments.","","","National Renewable Energy Lab.

Biological catalysts, the hydrogenases, exist in a wide-variety of microbes and are biosynthesized from abundant, non-precious metals. By virtue of a unique catalytic metallo-cluster that is composed of iron and sulfur, [FeFe]-hydrogenases are capable of catalyzing H{sub 2} production at turnover rates of millimoles-per-second. In addition, these biological catalysts possess some of the characteristics that are desired for cost-effective solar H{sub 2} production systems, high solubilities in aqueous solutions and low activation energies, but are sensitive to CO and O{sub 2}. We are investigating ways to merge [FeFe]-hydrogenases with a variety of organic materials and nanomaterials for the fabrication of electrodes and biohybrids as catalysts for use in artificial solar H{sub 2} production systems. These efforts include designs that allow for the integration of [FeFe]-hydrogenase in dye-solar cells as models to measure solar conversion and H{sub 2} production efficiencies. In support of a more fundamental understanding of [FeFe]-hydrogenase for these and other applications the role of protein structure in catalysis is being investigated. Currently there is little known about the mechanism of how these and other enzymes couple multi-electron transfer to proton reduction. To further the mechanistic understanding of [FeFe]-hydrogenases, structural models for substrate transfer are being used to create enzyme variants for biochemical analysis.

WO{sub 3} films were deposited on unheated substrates by thermal evaporation followed by annealing at temperatures of 300, 500, and 600 C for 5 h in air. The WO{sub 3} film annealed at 500 C shows the best photoelectrochemical response due to improved crystallinity and enhanced light absorption in the long-wavelength region. Although the WO{sub 3} film annealed at 600 C exhibits better crystallinity and increased light absorption properties, it shows a decreased photoelectrochemical response in comparison to the one annealed at 500 C. These results strongly suggests that the reduced amount of electrochemical reaction sites for the film annealed at 600 C film plays a significant role in influencing the decreased photoresponse.","","","National Renewable Energy Lab.

Six native [FeFe]-hydrogenase genes from species of Clostridia were first cloned and separately expressed in Escherichia coli concomitantly with the assembly proteins required for [FeFe]-hydrogenase maturation. All enzymes, with the exception of C. thermocellum HydA, exhibited significant activity when expressed. Single-stranded DNA fragments from genes encoding the two most active [FeFe]-hydrogenases were used to optimize a gene-shuffling protocol and generate recombinant enzyme libraries. Random sampling demonstrates that several shuffled products are active. This represents the first successful application of gene-shuffling using hydrogenases. Moreover, we demonstrate that a single set of [FeFe]-hydrogenase maturation proteins is sufficient for the heterologous assembly of the bioinorganic active site of several native and shuffled [FeFe]-hydrogenases.","","","National Renewable Energy Lab.

We report for the first time MEG yields in colloidal Si NCs using ultrafast transient absorption spectroscopy. We find the threshold photon energy for MEG in 9.5 nm diameter Si NCs (effective band gap {identical_to} Eg = 1.20 eV) to be 2.4 {+-} 0.1E{sub g} and find an exciton-production quantum yield of 2.6 {+-} 0.2 excitons per absorbed photon at 3.4E{sub g}. While MEG has been previously reported in direct-gap semiconductor NCs of PbSe, PbS, PbTe, CdSe, and InAs, this represents the first report of MEG within indirect-gap semiconductor NCs. Furthermore, MEG is found in relatively large Si NCs (diameter equal to about twice the Bohr radius) such that the confinement energy is not large enough to produce a large blue-shift of the band gap (only 80 meV), but the Coulomb interaction is sufficiently enhanced to produce efficient MEG. Our findings are of particular importance because Si dominates the photovoltaic solar cell industry, presents no problems regarding abundance and accessibility within the Earth's crust, and poses no significant environmental problems regarding toxicity.","","","National Renewable Energy Lab.

Capillary stress created during evaporation of liquids from the mesopores of dense TiO{sub 2} NT arrays was of sufficient magnitude to induce bundling and microcrack formation. The average lateral deflection of the NTs in the bundles increased with the surface tension of the liquids and with the film thicknesses. The supercritical CO{sub 2} drying technique was used to produce bundle-free and crack-free NT films. Charge transport and recombination properties of sensitized films were studied by frequency-resolved modulated photocurrent/photovoltage spectroscopies. Transport became significantly faster with decreased clustering of the NTs, indicating that bundling creates additional pathways via intertube contacts. Removing such contacts alters the transport mechanism from a combination of one and three dimensions to the expected one dimension and shortens the electron-transport pathway. Reducing intertube contacts also resulted in a lower density of surface recombination centers by minimizing distortion-induced surface defects in bundled NTs. A causal connection between transport and recombination is observed. The dye coverage was greater in the more aligned NT arrays, suggesting that reducing intertube contacts increases the internal surface area of the films accessible to dye molecules. The solar conversion efficiency and photocurrent density were highest for DSSCs incorporating films with more aligned NT arrays owing to an enhanced light-harvesting efficiency. Removing structural disorder from other materials and devices consisting of nominally one-dimensional architectures (e.g., nanowire arrays) should produce similar effects.","","","National Renewable Energy Lab.

Specifically, we demonstrate that thin layers of carbon nanotubes in combination with insulating polymer layers can effectively replace the metal oxide layers typically used in polycrystalline thin-film solar cells. Replacing the standard n-type ZnO layer with a thin film of carbon nanotubes yielded energy conversion efficiencies up to 13%. The optical and electrical transport properties of the single-wall carbon nanotubes suggest that suitable applications for these materials include multiple-junction solar cells, thermophotovoltaics, and other applications benefiting from a p-type transparent conductor with high near-infrared transmission.","","","National Renewable Energy Lab.

We report here a theoretical investigation of the optical response and of the excited-state properties of three-arm and four-arm phenyl-cored dendrimers for photovoltaic applications. A variety of theoretical methods are used and evaluated against each other to calculate vertical transition energies, absorption and excitation spectra with vibronic structure, charge transport, and excitonic behavior upon photoexcitation and photoemission processes. Photophysical phenomena in these dendrimers are, in general, better explained with ab initio methods rather than with semiempirical techniques. Calculated reorganization energies were found to correlate well with the device photocurrent data where available. The excitons formed during photoexcitation are calculated to be more delocalized than the ones formed after vibrational relaxation in the excited states for fluorescence emission. The localization of excitons in emission processes is a result of geometrical changes in the excited state coupled with vibronic modes. Correlated electron-hole pair diagrams illustrate breaking of {pi}-conjugation in three-arm dendrimers due to meta linkage of arms with the core, whereas four-arm dendrimers are not affected by such breaking due to presence of ortho and para branching. Yet, ortho branching causes large twist angles between the core and the arms that are detrimental to {pi}-electron system delocalization over the structure.","","","National Renewable Energy Lab.

Polarizations both under chopped light and at different light intensities reveal that the photocurrent is linear to the input light intensity, indicating that the material has an efficient charge transport process. At varied light intensities, photocurrent decays with time. XPS was used to study the depth profiles of fresh sample and the polarized ones. Photocurrent decay is then related to the surface In-rich and Ga- and P-deficient layer formation. This layer thickens with the polarization time, and it is considered due to the selective dissolution of Ga. For GaInP2 film acting as a photoelectrode in photoelectrochemical water splitting, it will need protection to obtain a longer life time.","","","National Renewable Energy Lab.

We have been observing the growth of defects caused by tritium decay in tritiated a Si-H instead of inducing defects optically. Tritium decays to {sup 3}He, emitting a beta particle (average energy of 5.7 keV) and an antineutrino. This reaction has a half-life of 12.5 years. In these 7 at.% tritium-doped a-Si:H samples each beta decay will create a defect by converting a bonded tritium to an interstitial helium, leaving behind a silicon dangling bond. We use ESR (electron spin resonance) and PDS( photothermal deflection spectroscopy) to track the defects. First we annealed these samples, and then we used ESR to determine the initial defect density around 10{sup 16} to 10{sup 17}/cm{sup 3}, which is mostly a surface spin density. After that we have kept the samples in liquid nitrogen for almost two years. During the two years we have used ESR to track the defect densities of the samples. The defect density increases without saturation to a value of 3 x 10{sup 19}/cm{sup 3} after two years, a number smaller than one would expect if each tritium decay were to create a silicon dangling bond (2 x 10{sup 20}/cm{sup 3}). This result suggests that there might be either an annealing process that remains at liquid nitrogen temperature, or tritium decay in clustered phase not producing a dangling bond due to bond reconstruction and emission of the hydrogen previously paired to Si-bonded tritium atom. After storage in liquid nitrogen for two years, we have annealed the samples. We have stepwise annealed one sample at temperatures up to 200, where all of the defects from beta decay are annealed out, and reconstructed the annealing energy distribution. The second sample, which was grown at 150, has been isothermally annealing at 300 K for several months. The defects remain well above their saturation value at 300 K, and the shape of decay suggests some interaction between the defects.","Warrendale, PA: Materials Research Society","","National Renewable Energy Lab.

Spectroscopic ellipsometry measurements of polycrystalline CuInSe{sub 2} films reveal that there is a thin layer at the surface which has different optical and electronic properties from those of the bulk film. This surface layer of thin-film CIGS has a larger band gap and greater spin-orbit interaction energy than the bulk film. These properties indicate that the surface layer is more Cu deficient than the bulk in the nearly stoichiometric thin-film PX-CIGS used in photovoltaic devices.

This is referred to as the incoming longwave irradiance in this article. The method is based on an indoor calibration using a low-temperature blackbody source to obtain the calibration coefficients that determine the pyrgeometer's radiation characteristics. From these coefficients the outgoing irradiance of the pyrgeometer can be calculated. The pyrgeometer is then installed outdoors on an aluminum plate that is connected to a circulating temperature bath. By adjusting the temperature bath to the approximate value of the effective sky temperature, the pyrgeometer's body temperature is lowered changing the pyrgeometer's thermopile output. If the incoming longwave irradiance is stable, the slope of the outgoing irradiance versus the pyrgeometer's thermopile output is the outdoor net irradiance responsivity (RSnet), independent of the absolute value of the atmospheric longwave irradiance. The indoor calibration coefficients and the outdoor RSnet are then used in the pyrgeometer equation to calculate the incoming longwave irradiance. To evaluate this method, the calculated irradiance using the derived coefficients was compared to the irradiance measured using a pyrgeometer with direct traceability to the World Infrared Standard Group (WISG). This is maintained at the Physikalisch-Meteorologisches Observatorium Davos, World Radiation Center, Switzerland. Based on results from four pyrgeometers calibrations, this method suggests measurement agreement with the WISG to within +/- 3 W/m2 for all sky conditions.","","","National Renewable Energy Lab.

Recent advances in solar power conversion efficiencies have propelled organic-based photovoltaics out of the realm of strictly fundamental research at the university level and into the industrial laboratory setting. Fabricated from organic materials—polymers and molecules—these devices are potentially easier to manufacture than current technologies based on silicon or other materials. In this introductory article, we describe the motivation for pursuing research in this field and provide an overview of the various technical approaches that have been developed to date.We conclude by discussing the challenges that need to be overcome in order for organic photovoltaics to realize their potential as an economically viable path to harvesting energy from sunlight.","Materials Research Society","","National Renewable Energy Lab.

Addition of the surfactant to the CdS deposition bath allowed increased wetting of Cu(In,Ga)Se{sub 2} substrates and an increase in the uniformity of films, especially on model hydrophobic substrates. X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy and ultraviolet photoelectron spectroscopy data demonstrate that films produced with the surfactant have the same chemical and electronic properties as films grown without it. In CdS/Cu(In,Ga)Se{sub 2} devices, it was found that Triton X-100 allowed the use of CdS layers that were three to four times thinner than those used normally in high efficiency CIGS-based devices and eliminated the large drops in open-circuit voltage that usually accompany very thin buffer layers. For these thin CdS layers and relative to devices made without the surfactant, average absolute cell efficiencies were increased from 10.5% to 14.8% or by a relative 41%. Visual inspection of the CdS depositions reveals one possible mechanism of the surfactant's effects: Bubbles that form and adhere to the CIGS surface during the chemical bath deposition are almost completely eliminated with the addition of the TX-100. Thus, junction nonuniformities, pinholes, and thin areas in the CdS layer caused by poor wetting of the substrate surface are sharply reduced, leading to large increases in the open-circuit voltage in devices produced with the surfactant.","","","National Renewable Energy Lab.

However, S diffusion is required for lifetimes comparable to those observed in high-efficiency solar cells. Low-temperature photoluminescence, cathodoluminescence, and scanning electron images indicate how defect chemistry, grain-boundary passivation, and morphology are affected by S diffusion and the CdCl{sub 2} treatment.","","","National Renewable Energy Lab.

The observed transitions are exceedingly sharp, similar to those observed for excitons bound to nitrogen pairs in high quality GaAs with the narrowest transition being only 94 {micro}eV. Moreover, several other features can be observed originating most likely from phonon replicas of the nitrogen pair bound excitons and higher order clusters. However, the main transitions which dominate the photoluminescence spectra are thought to originate from excitons bound to a three nitrogen cluster. The sharp photoluminescence features are superimposed on a broad luminescence band indicating a strong perturbation induced by nitrogen atoms to the host GaAs lattice. The number of the allowed transitions and their polarization dependence provide important information about the arrangement of the nitrogen atoms in the cluster.","","","National Renewable Energy Lab.

Hydrogenated amorphous silicon (a-Si:H)/poly(3-hexylthiophene) (P3HT) and a-Si:H/poly(2-methoxy-5-(2{prime}-ethyl-hexyloxy)-1,4-phenylenevinylene) (MEH-PPV) solar cells show photoresponse dominated by exciton production in the polymer. The a-Si:H/P3HT devices are nearly as efficient as titania/P3HT cells.

The recent theory predicts that GBs in CIS are hole barriers, which prevent GB electrons from recombining. We examine the atomic structure and chemical composition of (112) GBs in Cu(In,Ga)Se{sub 2} (CIGS) using high-resolution Z-contrast imaging and nanoprobe x-ray energy-dispersive spectroscopy. We show that the theoretically predicted Cu-vacancy rows are not observed in (112) GBs in CIGS. Our first-principles modeling further reveals that the (112) GBs in CIS do not act as hole barriers. Our results suggest that the superior performance of polycrystalline CIS should not be explained solely by the GB behaviors.","","","National Renewable Energy Lab.

The influence of the guanidinium cation on the rate of recombination and band-edge movement was measured by transient photovoltage. When guanidinium is present in the electrolyte recombination becomes slower by a factor of about 20. At the same time, the adsorbent causes the band edges to move downward, toward positive electrochemical potentials, by 100 mV. The collective effect of both a downward shift of the band edges and slower recombination, owing to the presence of guanidinium, results in an overall improvement in the open-circuit photovoltage.","","","National Renewable Energy Lab.

Polymer solar cells have shown potential to harness solar energy in a cost-effective way. Significant efforts are underway to improve their efficiency to the level of practical applications. Here, we report highly efficient polymer solar cells based on a bulk heterojunction of polymer poly(3-hexylthiophene) and methanofullerene. Controlling the active layer growth rate results in an increased hole mobility and balanced charge transport. Together with increased absorption in the active layer, this results in much-improved device performance, particularly in external quantum efficiency. The power-conversion efficiency of 4.4% achieved here is the highest published so far for polymer-based solar cells. The solution process involved ensures that the fabrication cost remains low and the processing is simple. The high efficiency achieved in this work brings these devices one step closer to commercialization.","","","National Renewable Energy Lab.

"Transparent Conducting Oxides","Ginley, David S.; Bright, Clark","14 SOLAR ENERGY; 36 MATERIALS SCIENCE; transparent conducting oxides; n-type materials; p-type materials; deposition","<p>In the interim between the conception of this issue of<italic>MRS Bulletin</italic>on transparent conducting oxides (TCOs) and its publication, the remarkable applications dependent on these materials have continued to make sweeping strides. These include the advent of larger flat-screen high-definition televisions (HDTVs), larger and higher-resolution screens on portable computers, the increasing importance of low emissivity (“low-e”) and electrochromic windows, a significant increase in the manufacturing of thin-film photovoltaics (PV), and a plethora of new hand-held and smart devices, all with smart displays.<sup>1-7</sup>Coupled with the increased importance of TCO materials to these application technologies has been a renaissance over the last two years in the science of these materials. This has included new<italic>n</italic>-type materials, the synthesis of true<italic>p</italic>-type materials, and the theoretical prediction and subsequent confirmation of the applicability of codoping to produce<italic>p</italic>-type ZnO. Considering that over the last 20 years much of the work on TCOs was empirical and focused on ZnO and variants of In<sub>x</sub>Sn<sub>1-x</sub>O<sub>2</sub>, it is quite remarkable how this field has exploded.

Meanwhile, a redshift of the peak position, a decrease of the intensity, and a narrower bandwidth for the low energy PL are also observed.

"Thermophotovoltaic and photovoltaic conversion at high-flux densities","Coutts, T J; Ward, J S","14 SOLAR ENERGY; 36 MATERIALS SCIENCE; SOLAR CONCENTRATORS; CONCENTRATOR SOLAR CELLS; PHOTOVOLTAIC CONVERSION; THERMOPHOTOVOLTAIC CONVERSION","The authors first discuss the similarities between generation of electricity using thermophotovoltaic (TPV) and high-optical-concentration solar photovoltaic (PC) devices. Following this, the authors consider power losses due to above- and below-bandgap photons, and estimate the ideal bandgap by minimizing the sum of these, for a 6,000 K black-body spectrum. The ideal bandgap, based on this approach, is less than that previously predicted, which could have a significant influence on the performance of devices and systems. To reduce the losses, the authors show that the low-energy photons may be removed from both types of cells and consider the specific case of a back-surface reflector. This approach to the management of waste heat may offer a useful additional tool with which to facilitate the design of high-photo-flux solar cells. In the case of the high-energy photons and the associated problem of thermalization of hot electrons, however, the heat must be removed by other means, and the authors consider the applicability of microchannel cooling systems. These appear to have the potential to handle thermal loads at least several times those generated by 1,000 times concentrators, or by black-body TPV radiators at a temperature of far greater than 1,500 K. The authors go on to consider the management of the very high currents generated in both concentrator TPV and PV systems and discuss the concept of the monolithically integrated minimodule.","","","National Renewable Energy Lab.

Our results indicate that when CdS/CdTe devices have a very thin layer of CdS or no CdS at all, the i-SnO{sub 2} buffer layer helps to increase device efficiency. When the CdS layer is thicker than 600 {Angstrom}, the device performance is dominated by CdS thickness, not the i-SnO{sub 2} layer. If a very thin CdS layer is to be used to enhance device performance, we conclude that a better SnO{sub 2} buffer layer is needed. {copyright} {ital 1999 American Institute of Physics.}","","","National Renewable Energy Lab.

The characteristics of devices made in this manner suggest that the reaction generates a thin, n-doped region in the absorber.

The goals of PVMaT are to assist the U.S. PV industry improve module manufacturing processes and equipment; accelerate manufacturing cost reductions for PV modules, balance-of-systems components, and integrated systems; increase commercial product performance and reliability; and enhance investment opportunities for substantial scale-ups of U.S.-based PV manufacturing plant capacities. The approach for PVMaT has been to cost-share the R&D risk as industry explores new manufacturing options and ideas for improved PV modules and components, advances system and product integration, and develops new system designs. These activities will lead to overall reduced system life-cycle costs for reliable PV end-products. The 1994 PVMaT Product-Driven BOS and Systems activities, as well as Product-Driven Module Manufacturing R&D activities, are just being completed. Fourteen new subcontracts have just been awarded in the areas of PV System and Component Technology and Module Manufacturing Technology. Government funding, subcontractor cost-sharing, and a comparison of the relative efforts by PV technology throughout the PVMaT project are also discussed. {copyright} {ital 1999 American Institute of Physics.}","","","National Renewable Energy Lab.

"Review of the photothermal stability of EVA pottants: Effects of formulation on the discoloration rate and mitigation methods","Pern, F J; Glick, S H; Czanderna, A W","14 SOLAR ENERGY; SOLAR CELL ARRAYS; SOLAR ABSORBERS; ENCAPSULATION; STABILITY; COLOR; FABRICATION; SPECTRAL RESPONSE; VISIBLE SPECTRA","Results from extensive studies of the commercial ethylene vinyl acetate (EVA) formulations show that the UV absorber and curing-generated UV-excitable, {alpha},{beta}-unsaturated carbonyl chromophores facilitate the EVA discoloration, which is further enhanced by curing-generated acetic acid and probably residual peroxide curing agent also. Formation and concentration of the UV-excitable chromophores are substantially promoted by the antioxidant, Naugard P. The discoloration rate is greater under higher UV light intensity and temperatures. Heating in the dark at elevated temperatures (e.g., 85&hthinsp;{degree}C) in the air for {approximately}200 days only results in light yellowing. The discoloration reactions compete with photobleaching reactions, which destroy curing-generated chromophores and result in non-discoloring of EVA. By using better performance stabilizers to minimize the curing-generated UV-excitable chromophores, a new fast curing agent, and no UV absorber, the NREL-developed EVA formulations show a superior photothermal stability against browning to the commercial counterparts. Alternatively, the discoloration rate of the commercial EVA pottants can be considerably reduced by using UV-filtering glass superstrates that largely inhibit the UV-induced photooxidation reactions, or completely eliminated by using air-permeable polymer superstrate films that enable photobleaching reactions. {copyright} {ital 1999 American Institute of Physics.}","","","National Renewable Energy Lab.

These data are summarized in terms of the temperature coefficients of the modules{close_quote} current-voltage (I-V) parameters, dissected into four representative illumination levels (125, 250, 500 and 1000 W/m{sup 2} irradiance). The average efficiency taken at 1000 W/m{sup 2} irradiance and referenced to 25&hthinsp;{degree}C span a range of values from 10.5{percent} to 13.2{percent}, for the six modules. Yet, the behavior of the temperature coefficients of the I-V curves exhibit similar functional dependence against irradiance for each of the I-V parameters. The data show the temperature coefficients vary substantially across the range of illumination levels examined. Hence, if extrapolation of module performance in the field is made from a single set of coefficients measured at one illumination level, it will likely result in inaccurate prediction of that performance. Furthermore, the data show that when measured under natural lighting, there is a fair amount of dispersion in coefficients and performance at the lower (about 250 W/m{sup 2} or less) irradiance levels. {copyright} {ital 1999 American Institute of Physics.}","","","National Renewable Energy Lab.

Modeling calculations have shown that a thin, highly defective layer at this interface, perhaps caused by significant H out-diffusion and incomplete lattice reconstruction, results in sharply lower device FFs due to the large voltage dropped across this defective layer. We have therefore employed buffer layers designed to retard this out-diffusion. We find that an increased H content, either in the n-layer or a thin intrinsic low temperature buffer layer, does not significantly retard this out-diffusion, as observed by SIMS H profiles on devices. However, if this low temperature buffer layer is thick enough, the out-diffusion is minimized, yielding nearly flat H profiles and a much improved device performance. We discuss this behavior in the context of the H chemical potentials and H diffusion coefficients in the high temperature, buffer, n-, and stainless steel substrate layers. Finally, we report a 9.8{percent} initial active area device, fabricated at 16.5 {Angstrom}/s, using the insights obtained in this study.

Secondary ion mass spectroscopy (SIMS) is used to study Cu diffusion within this back-contact structure, and also, to monitor Cu diffusion from the contact into the CdTe. When Ni metallization is used, the ZnTe:Cu layer becomes increasingly depleted of Cu, and Ni diffusion into the ZnTe:Cu increases as the contact deposition temperature increases from 100&hthinsp;{degree}C to 300&hthinsp;{degree}C. Cu depletion is not observed when Ni is replaced with Ti. Diffusion of Cu from the ZnTe:Cu layer into the ZnTe layer also increases with contact deposition temperature, and produces a buildup of Cu at the ZnTe/CdTe interface. High-mass resolution SIMS indicates that, although Cu levels in the CdTe remain low, Cu diffusion from the contact proceeds into the CdTe layer and toward the CdTe/CdS junction region. {copyright} {ital 1999 American Institute of Physics.}","","","National Renewable Energy Lab.

Under the AM1.5 direct spectrum with all the light higher in energy than the GaAs band gap filtered out, the prototypes grown with base doping of about 10{sup 17}&hthinsp;cm{sup {minus}3} have open-circuit voltages ranging from 0.35 to 0.44 V, short-circuit current densities of 1.8 mA/cm{sup 2}, and fill factors from 61{percent} to 66{percent}. To improve on the current record-efficiency tandem GaInP/GaAs solar cell by adding a GaInNAs junction, the short-circuit current density of this 1-eV cell must be significantly increased. Because these low short-circuit current densities are due to short diffusion lengths, we have demonstrated a depletion-width-enhanced variation of one of the prototype devices that trades off decreased voltage for increased photocurrent, with a short-circuit current density of 7.4 mA/cm{sup 2} and an open-circuit voltage of 0.28 V. {copyright} {ital 1999 American Institute of Physics.}","","","National Renewable Energy Lab.

"The NREL outdoor accelerated-weathering tracking system and photovoltaic module exposure results","Basso, T S","14 SOLAR ENERGY; TESTING; NATIONAL RENEWABLE ENERGY LABORATORY; SOLAR CELL ARRAYS; TEST FACILITIES; PERFORMANCE TESTING; ELECTRICAL PROPERTIES","This paper describes the Outdoor Accelerated-weathering Tracking System (OATS) and interim results for the first OATS study on photovoltaic (PV) modules. With two test planes measuring 1.52{times}1.83&hthinsp;m, OATS provides a unique solar-concentrating exposure capability. Test sample temperatures are moderated by air blowers. Water spray capability exists for wetting samples. The OATS two-axis tracker points to the sun using software calculations. Non-imaging aluminum reflectors give a nominal clear-sky optical concentration ratio of three. Field-qualification measurements in the test plane under reflector conditions showed its relative irradiance non-uniformity was {plus_minus}15{percent} for a clear-sky summer day with {plus_minus} 75 mm as the smallest distance for that non-uniformity. Exposure studies began in November 1997 on seven pairs of commercially available ribbon silicon, crystalline silicon and amorphous silicon PV modules kept at constant resistive load. The modules were periodically removed from OATS for visual inspection and solar simulator performance measurements. There were no module failures. This PV module study is ongoing and later results will be compared to other testing techniques. Through July 1998, the modules under reflector conditions received 392 MJ/m{sup 2} of total ultraviolet (TUV) exposure. That was 2.07 times the TUV exposure compared to a south-facing fixed array tilted 40{degree} up from horizontal at NREL. Similarly, the modules in the test plane under the covered reflectors received 1.04 times the fixed array TUV exposure. For the test plane under the covered reflectors there was a loss of 13{percent} TUV exposure attributed to the reflectors blocking some of the diffuse-sky UV light. Also through July 1998, the OATS sunlight availability measured 95{percent} compared to the cumulative global normal exposure at the NREL Solar Radiation Research Laboratory (SRRL). The OATS sunlight availability losses included downtime when the PV modules were removed, and when there were OATS tracking problems, maintenance, and repair. For December 1997 through July 1998, the SRRL cumulative exposure was 99{percent} compared to the respective monthly averages from years 1961 through 1990 at Boulder, Colorado. {copyright} {ital 1999 American Institute of Physics.}","","","National Renewable Energy Lab.

The instrument uses the direct-current photoconductance decay (DC-PCD) method for linear detection of the transient photoconductance signal and localized probing / illumination for necessary sensitivity on low resistivity and large samples. The instrument also has a compact and high-power laser diode as the light source, data averaging capability, a pneumatic ingot transport and probe positioning mechanism, and a user-friendly graphical interface for data acquisition / lifetime calculation / data storage / hardcopy for factory-floor use with quick turnaround. A 3-dimensional finite-element analysis indicates that the as-cut surface finish is adequate for measuring the bulk lifetime on the order of 50 {mu}s or less.

Zinc stannate films have a high bandgap, high transmittance, low absorptance, and low surface roughness. In addition, these films are chemically stable and exhibit higher resistivities that are roughly matched to that of the CdS window layer in the device structure. Preliminary device results have demonstrated that by integrating a ZTO buffer layer in both SnO{sub 2}-based and Cd{sub 2}SnO{sub 4} (CTO)-based CdS/CdTe devices, performance and reproducibility can be significantly enhanced. {copyright} {ital 1999 American Institute of Physics.}","","","National Renewable Energy Lab.

We use this ability to understand how a back-contact, nitric-phosphoric (NP) etch affects the grain boundaries throughout the film. Quantitative determination of the grain-boundary barrier potentials and estimates of doping density near the grain perimeter are determined from theoretical fits to measurements of the current vs. temperature. Estimates of the bulk doping are determined from high-frequency resistivity measurements. Also, a variable doping density within the grains of non-etched material has been determined. These results allow a semi-quantitative grain-boundary band diagram to be drawn that should aid in determining more-accurate two-dimensional models for polycrystalline CdTe solar cells. {copyright} {ital 1999 American Institute of Physics.}","","","National Renewable Energy Lab.

Nonuniform browning patterns of ethylene vinyl acetate (EVA) pottants were observed for glass/EVA/glass-encapsulated c-Si cell samples under solar simulator exposures at elevated temperatures. The polymer/polymer-configured laminates with Tedlar or Tefzel did not discolor because of photobleaching reactions, but yellowed with polyester or nylon top films. Delamination was observed for the polyester/EVE layers on a-Si minimodules and for a polyolefin-based thermoplastic pottant at high temperatures. For all tested c-Si cell samples, irregular changes in the current-voltage parameters were observed that could not be accounted for simply by the transmittance changes of the superstrate/pottant layers.

The electronic and infrared properties of the film have been measured as a function of deposition parameters, leading to three principal conclusions. First, to obtain a high quality material, the Si atoms evaporated from the filament (distance L from the substrate) must react with silane (density ns) before reaching the substrate; this requires nsL greater than a critical value. Second, radical-radical reactions cause deterioration of film properties at high values of G(nsL),3 where G is the film growth rate; this requires G(nsL)3 less than a critical value. Finally, the film quality is a function of G, and as G is increased the substrate temperature must be correspondingly increased to obtain high film quality. By optimizing these parameters, we have produced films with excellent electronic properties (e.g., ambipolar diffusion length &gt;200 nm) at &gt;5 nm/s deposition rate. Based on these insights, formulas are also given for optimizing film properties in multiple-filament geometries and in diluted silane.","","","National Renewable Energy Lab.

This model not only explains a variety of seemingly conflicting experimental results reported in the literature that cannot be explained by existing models, it also has practical implications with respect to improving the coloring efficiency and durability of electrochromic devices. According to this model, a typical as-deposited tungsten oxide film has tungsten mainly in W6+ and W4+ states and can be represented as W6+(1-y) W4+(y)O(3-y) .cntdot. nH2O. The proposed chromic mechanism is based on the small polaron transition between the charge-induced W5+ state and the orignial W4+ state insteasd of the W5+ and W6+ states as suggested in previous models. The correlation between the electrochromic and photochromic behavior in amorphous tungsten oxide films is also discussed.","","","National Renewable Energy Lab.

In spite of great advances, all of the PV material systems that are currently being developed have problems that need to be solved. Therefore, the search for new material systems will continue. It is reasonable to expect that the next generation of materials is likely to come from ternary and multinary semiconductors belonging to a class of tetrahedrally bonded diamond-like compounds. These are most promising because of their close similarity with traditional semiconductors with respect to their composition, crystal structure, nature of chemical bonds, and electronic structures. {copyright} {ital 1997 American Institute of Physics.}","","","National Renewable Energy Lab.

A world-record, total-area efficiency of 17.7{percent} has been achieved by the concurrent delivery of the metals in the presence of Se. Ga has been introduced into the device in a such a manner as to produce homogeneous, normal profiling, and double-profiling graded band gap structures. This has resulted in an open-circuit voltage (V{sub oc}) parameter of 680 mV and a fill-factor over 78{percent}.

Here, I measured a group of silicon wafers of various origins, doping levels and mechanical structure, to demonstrate the range of phenomena that occur in photovoltaic materials. These various wafers had been the subject of a previous round-robin lifetime evaluation. These measurements demonstrate the difficulty and complexity of finding the true recombination rate when the material is incorporated into an operating device. The conclusion also supports the notion that characterizing a defect-dominated semiconductor with a single lifetime number is often inadequate. {copyright} {ital 1997 American Institute of Physics.}","","","National Renewable Energy Lab.

"Can the Staebler-Wronski effect account for the long-term performance of a-Si PV arrays?","von Roedern, B; Kroposki, B","14 SOLAR ENERGY; PHOTOVOLTAIC CELLS; PERFORMANCE; SOLAR CELL ARRAYS; SOLAR ENERGY CONVERSION; SILICON; STABILITY; OPERATION","We suggest a model for the Staebler-Wronski degradation of a-Si based solar cells that can account for long-term performance observations of deployed a-Si photovoltaic modules. The model suggests that the stabilization of the Staebler-Wronski degradation does not occur because an equilibrium between light-induced degradation and thermal or light-induced recovery is reached. Rather, stabilization occurs because the degradation phenomenon itself is self-limiting, i.e., once enough degradation has been introduced, the degradation process diminishes. This model shows that the module performance and the long-term power output of an a-Si PV array depend not only on the operating conditions, but also, on the temperature history of light exposure. This makes it difficult to accurately predict the exact amount of degradation in the field. {copyright} {ital 1997 American Institute of Physics.}","","","National Renewable Energy Lab.

"Incorporation of Cu and Al in thin layer silicon grown from Cu-Al-Si","Wang, T H; Ciszek, T F","14 SOLAR ENERGY; SOLAR CELLS; FABRICATION; SILICON; PHOTOVOLTAIC CELLS; CHEMICAL COMPOSITION; COPPER ADDITIONS; ALUMINIUM ADDITIONS; PERFORMANCE","Cu and Al concentrations in silicon thin layers grown from Cu-Al-Si are determined by segregation at the solid-liquid interface, and for the fast diffusing Cu, also at the free silicon surface. Using the multicomponent regular solution model and experimental results, we found that Si-Al and Si-Cu interactions in the liquid solution are repulsive, and Al-Cu interaction is attractive. As a result, Al incorporation as a function of Cu and Al compositions in the growth solution is determined at about 900{degree}C. Up to 0.2{Omega}{center_dot}cm P-type resistivities caused by Al doping are achieved because of suppression of Al incorporation by Cu, yet with a substantial amount of Al still present in the liquid for substrate surface-oxide removal. On the other hand, Cu concentration in the grown layers is reduced by Al in the liquid during growth and by surface segregation after growth. The surface segregation phenomenon can be conveniently used to getter Cu from the bulk of silicon layers so that its concentration ({approximately}10{sup 16}cm{sup {minus}3}) is much lower than its solubility (2.5{times}10{sup 17}cm{sup {minus}3}) at the layer growth temperature and the reported 10{sup 17}cm{sup {minus}3} degradation onset for solar-cell performance. {copyright} {ital 1997 American Institute of Physics.}","","","National Renewable Energy Lab.

There is a very large need for new sources of energy for rural electrification in China as represented by 120 million people in remote regions who do not have access to an electric grid and by over 300 coastal islands in China that are unelectrified. In heavily populated regions in China where there is an electric grid, there are still severe shortages of electric power and limited access to the grid by village populations. In order to meet energy demands in rural China, renewable energy in the form of solar, wind, and biomass resources are being utilized as a cost effective alternative to grid extension and use of diesel and gasoline generators. An Energy Efficiency and Renewable Energy Protocol Agreement was signed by the U.S. Department of Energy with the Chinese State Science and Technology Commission in Beijing in February, 1995. Under this agreement, projects using photovoltaics for rural electrification are being conducted in Gansu Province in western China and Inner Mongolia in northern China, providing the basis for much wider deployment and use of photovoltaics for meeting the growing rural energy demands of China. {copyright} {ital 1997 American Institute of Physics.}","","","National Renewable Energy Lab.

"Surface-Related Optical Anisotropy of GaInP, InP, and GaP","Luo, J S; Geisz, J F; Olson, J M; Wu, M C","14 SOLAR ENERGY; 36 MATERIALS SCIENCE; ANISOTROPY; INDIUM PHOSPHIDES; GALLIUM PHOSPHIDES; Materials Science and Semiconductors","We have studied the optical anisotropy induced by the (0 0 1) surface reconstruction of GaInP, InP, and GaP annealed under various gas environments in an atmospheric-pressure metal-organic chemical vapor deposition system using reflectance difference spectroscopy (RDS). The RD spectra of InP under a PH3 partial pressure of 10 Torr in a carrier of H2 between 500 C and 400 C are consistent with a (2 x 1) surface reconstruction. As the temperature of the InP is lowered to 200 C under PH3, the signature of the RD spectrum changes. If the flow of PH3 is removed when the InP cools to 300 C, the RD spectrum remains consistent with the (2 x 1) surface reconstruction down to room temperature. When InP is annealed at 400 C in hydrogen, the RD spectrum becomes consistent with a (2 x 4) surface reconstruction. The temperature-dependent RD spectra of GaInP are very similar to those of InP. The RD spectra of GaP reveal that the P-terminated surface of GaP observed at high temperatures is more stable then either InP or GaInP surfaces in the absence of PH3. The features of these surface-related RD spectra are quickly quenched in air and, under some conditions, nitrogen. This observation is important for studies of bulk-related, ordering-induced optical anisotropy in GaInP.","","","National Renewable Energy Lab.

Employing a metathesis approach, cadmium iodide is reacted with sodium telluride in methanol solvent, resulting in the formation of soluble NaI and insoluble CdTe nanoparticles. After appropriate chemical workup, methanol-capped CdTe colloids were isolated. CdTe colloids prepared by this method exhibit a dependence of the nanoparticle diameter upon reaction temperature as determined by UV-visible spectroscopy (UV-vis), X-ray diffraction (XRD), and transmission electron microscopy (TEM). CdTe thin-film formation was performed by spray depositing the 25-75 .ANG. diameter nanoparticle colloids according to a one- or two-step method. Films derived from a one-step approach were sprayed onto substrates at elevated temperatures (Tdep = 280-440 .degree.C) with no further themal treatment. Two-step films were sprayed at lower temperatures (Tdep = 25-125 .degree.C) and were subjected to subsequent thermal treatments (Tanneal =250-500 .degree.C) in argon or forming gas (10% H2 in N2) ambients. The effects of a CdCl2 treatment were also investigated for CdTe films on both 7059 glass and CS on SnO2-coated 7059 glass. The CdTe films were characterized by XRD, X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS), and atomic force microscopy (AFM). Phase-pure cubic CdTe formation was observed by XRD for two-step derived films (400 .degree.C in forming gas) while one-step films were composed of the cubic CdTe and an oxide phase. XPS analysis of five films processed at 400 .degree. C and a variety of conditions showed that while CdTe films produced by the one-step method contained no Na or C and substantial O, two-step films subjected to a CdCl2 treatment showed reduced O but increased C content. AFM gave CdTe grain sizes of .apprx.0.1-0.3 and .apprx.0.3-0.7 .mu.m for one-step film sprayed at 400 .degree.C and a two-step film anealed at 400 .degree.C, respectively.

The measurements reveal that the interfacial chemistry, especially as affected by etchants, has a very strong influence on the kinetics of the charge transfer reaction. According to our impedance analysis, which covered a frequency range between 10 Hz and 400 kHz, movement of the energy bands in the onset region of the forward current can be excluded for this system. For this reason a comparatively simple model can be used for the evaluation of the second-order rate constants for the electrochemical charge transfer reaction across the semiconductor-electrolyte interface. The combined analysis of the steady-state current/potential curves and the impedance spectra show that for the semiconductor electrode-electrolyte systems we have studied, the electron transfer rate constant ranges from about mid-10-10 cm4 s-1 to 10-17 cm4 s-1. The former value is unusually large and is over 6 orders of magnitude greater than the maximum possible rate constant predicted and reported by other workers; possible explanations are discussed.","","","National Renewable Energy Lab.

The KRS-5 crystal enabled FTIR-ATR measurements to be made at frequencies above 400 cm-1. Atomic force microscopy (AFM) and X-ray diffraction (XRD) measurements were also made to further characterize the films. The measurements were repeated on single-crystal specimens of strontium titanate and the substrates for comparison. Softening in the frequency of the v{sub 4} transverse optical phonon in the lattice-mismatched films below the established value of 544 cm-1 is indicative of the highly textured, polycrystalline ceramic nature of the films and is consistent with the XRD and AFM results.","","","National Renewable Energy Lab.

By establishing guidelines for the inclusion of results into these tables, this not only provides an authoritative summary of the current state of the art but also encourages researchers to seek independent confirmation of results and to report results on a standardized basis. Briefly, the main criterion for inclusion of results into these tables is that they be measured at one of the designated test centres previously listed under standardized test conditions. A distinction is also made between three different cell area measurements: total area, aperture area and designated illumination area. 'Active area' efficiency measurements are not included. There are also certain minimum values of area encouraged for the different cell types, although some discretion is exercised here (0.05 cm2 for a concentrator cell, 0.25 cm2 for a tendem cell, 1 cm2 for a 1-sun cell and 800 cm2 for a module).","","","National Renewable Energy Lab.

Several etching solutions (HCl, HBr, and their mixtures with HNO3) were used in this study. We have found that ITO films containing a larger volume fraction of the amorphous phase show higher etch rates than those containing a larger volume fraction of the crystalline phase. Also, the crystalline ITO fims have shown a very good uniformity in patterning, and following the etching no ITO residue (unetched ITO) formation has been observed. In contrast, ITO residues were found after the etching of the films containing both amorphous and crystalline phases. We have also developed a process for the fabrication of the ITO with a tapered edge profile. The taper angle can be controlled by varying the ratio of HNO3 to the HCl in the etching solutions. Finally, ITO films have been found to be chemically unstable in a hydrogen containing plasma environment. On the contrary, aluminum doped zinc oxide (AZO) films, having an optical transmittance and electrical resisitivity comparable to ITO films, are very stable in the same hydrogen containing plasma environment. In addition, a high etch rate, no etching residue formation, and a uniform etching have been found for the AZO films, which make them suitable for a-Si:H TFT-LCD applications.","","","National Renewable Energy Lab.

The efficiencies are the highest confirmed two-terminal values measured for any solar cell within each standard illumination category. The monolithic, series-connected design of the tandem cells allows them to be substituted for silicon or gallium arsenide cells in photovoltaic panel systems with minimal design changes. The advantages of using GaInP/GaAs tandem solar cells in space and terrestrial applications are discussed primarily in terms of the reduction in balance-of-system costs that accrues when using a higher efficiency cell. The new efficiency values represent a significant improvement over previous efficiencies for this materials system, and we identify grid design, back interface passivation, and top interface passivation as the three key factors leading to this improvement. In producing the high-efficiency cells, we have addressed nondestructive diagnostics and materials growth reproducibility as well as peak cell performance.","","","National Renewable Energy Lab.

This switching voltage is smaller than required by other solid-state EC devices reported to date. We attribute the lower-than-normal switching voltage to the use of a thermally evaporated MgF{sub 2} thin film as the lithium ion conducting layer. Electrochemical impedance spectroscopy studies show that high lithium ion conductivity and low interfacial barriers for lithium exchange with the adjacent electrochromic and ion storage layers make MgF{sub 2} a good choice for the ion conductor in EC devices. This reduction in switching voltage is a first step toward powering an EC device by an integrated semitransparent single-junction photovoltaic (PV) cell.

One alternative that provides the required contact parameters employs a Cu-doped ZnTe(ZnTe:Cu) interface layer between the {ital p}-CdTe and the outer metal contact. Thin films of ZnTe:Cu containing various concentrations of metallic Cu are produced by rf-magnetron sputtering. Additionally, the effect of incorporating small amounts of excess Zn into the sputtering target is studied.

Arriving at a conclusion drawn by other groups, we find that H dilution of the {ital i} layer increases device stability. H diluted devices usually degrade to saturation in less than 100 hours at AM1 Sun light intensity. We also find that our devices grown without H dilution degrade to saturation in less than 100 hours. However, they degrade to a lower value than the devices grown with H dilution. The main reason is that {ital V}{sub OC} does not decrease in the former (H-diluted) devices, whereas it does in the later devices. Changes in the stability of material properties in the {ital i} layer, as measured on companion films, show little if any affect of the hydrogen dilution.

Three important areas of defect engineering are considered. These include impurity gettering, impurity/defect passivation, and spatial distribution of impurities and defects. It is shown that processes such as gettering, and impurity and defect passivation do not occur uniformly within solar cells. It is also shown that non-uniformities arising from impurity segregation and dislocation pile-up can have disproportionately large influence on the cell performance.

We have studied the evolution of these properties under systematic variation of post-growth treatment conditions for several standard deposition techniques. The electro-optical properties and nanostructure depend strongly on deposition conditions and post-growth treatments. Our results indicate that the standard CdCl{sub 2}{emdash}heat treatment enhances grain size and passivates defects. We have also found strong evidence for sulfur diffusion across the CdTe{emdash}CdS interface. This interdiffusion produces a thin layer at the junction with a bandgap lower than the rest of the absorber layer. This effect could have important implications for photoexcited carrier collection in photovoltaic applications. {copyright} {ital 1996 American Institute of Physics.}","","","National Renewable Energy Lab.

Based on the results, some alternative PV module encapsulation schemes are proposed for improved module performance, where the current or modified formulations of EVA encapsulants still can be used so that the typical processing tools and conditions need not to be changed significantly. The schemes are designed in an attempt to eliminate or minimize the EVA yellow-browning and to increase the module power output. Four key experimental results from the studies of EVA discoloration and encapsulation are to employ: (1) UV-absorbing (filtering) glasses as superstrates to protect EVA from UV-induced discoloration, (2) gas-permeable polymer films as superstrates and/or substrates to prevent EVA yellowing by permitting photobleaching reactions, (3) modified EVA formulations, and (4) internal reflection of the light by white substrates. {copyright} {ital 1996 American Institute of Physics.}","","","National Renewable Energy Lab.

We have found that the treatment of the top surface of the HW {ital i} layer during cooling is crucial to device performance. Without any particular attention paid to the treatment of this surface while the sample is cooling from its high deposition temperature, a significant amount of H diffuses out of the sample during the cooling process, particularly near the surface, resulting in devices with very poor photovoltaic properties. By designing a surface treatment to address this problem, we have been able to deposit HW Schottky structures with device characteristics as good as the best glow discharge devices produced in our laboratory.

Using technical input from a number of sources, and under the guidance of an industry-based technical review committee, the approach described in this paper was developed. The Module Energy Rating (MER) consists of 10 estimates of how much energy a single typical module of a particular type will produce in one day, one for each of 5 different weather/location combinations and 2 load-types. This paper presents an overview of the procedures required to generate an MER for any particular module type. {copyright} {ital 1996 American Institute of Physics.}","","","National Renewable Energy Lab.

Cu{sub 2{minus}{ital x}}Se and In{sub 6}Se{sub 7} layers were deposited on GaAs (100) by physical vapor deposition from Cu{sub 2}Se and In{sub 2}Se{sub 3} sources. CdS overlayers were then deposited {ital in} {ital situ}, at room temperature, in steps on these layers. Photoemission measurements were acquired after each growth to observe changes in the valence-band electronic structure and changes in the In4{ital d} and Cd4{ital d} core lines. The results were used to correlate the interfacial chemistry with the electronic structure and to directly determine the CdS/Cu{sub 2{minus}{ital x}}Se and CdS/In{sub 6}Se{sub 7} heterojunction valence-band discontinuities and the consequent heterojunction band diagrams. These results are compared to the valence-band offset ({Delta}{ital E}{sub {ital v}}) for the CdS/CuInSe{sub 2} heterojunction interface.","","","National Renewable Energy Lab.

Due to the small energy separation between the {Gamma}- and the {ital L}-point conduction-band minima for this alloy composition, a significant fraction of the free carriers at room temperature are present in the {ital L}-conduction-band valley, giving rise to a multicomponent plasma. The carrier concentrations extracted from the Raman spectra for the different epilayers are in good agreement with the free electron concentrations determined by capacitance-voltage measurements. We employ the light scattering technique to extract the carrier concentration in the {ital n}-type emitter layer of a GaInP-based solar cell. {copyright} {ital 1995} {ital American} {ital Institute} {ital of} {ital Physics}.","","","National Renewable Energy Lab.

In the first experiment, x-ray photoelectron and Auger electron spectroscopies are used to show that etching CdTe in HNO{sub 3}:H{sub 3}PO{sub 4} results in a Te layer on the CdTe surface. In the second experiment, photoemission spectroscopy is used to explore the electronic properties of evaporated Te deposited on thin-film, polycrystalline {ital p}-CdTe in an effort to develop a band diagram for the Te/{ital p}-CdTe interface. The motivation for developing the band diagram derives from previous observations that chemically etching polycrystalline {ital p}-CdTe solar-cell device material before application of the back contact reduces the series resistance of the device. The key results are that the evaporated Te overlayer is {ital p} type and that the valence-band offset between Te and {ital p}-CdTe is favorable for low-series-resistance contact, {Delta}{ital E}{sub {ital v}}=0.26{plus_minus}0.1 eV.","","","National Renewable Energy Lab.

These specifications can be categorized into three areas: the device temperature at the time of measurement; the total incident irradiance level; and the spectral distribution of the incident irradiance. If these three conditions are identical to those specified in the standard measurement procedures, then no translation is required. However, because in practice the standard measurement conditions can be very difficult (and expensive) to achieve, one or more of these three conditions will generally be different and translation is then necessary.","","","National Renewable Energy Lab.
