"Three-dimensional seismic characterization and imaging of the Soda Lake geothermal field","Gao, Kai; Huang, Lianjie; Cladouhos, Trenton","15 GEOTHERMAL ENERGY; Full-waveform inversion; Fault detection; Reverse-time migration; Soda Lake geothermal field; Surface seismic data","Accurate characterization of subsurface geophysical properties and detection of the fault system are essential for geothermal energy exploration and production. The Soda Lake geothermal field is in western Nevada with a complex fault system. Previous seismic characterization only produced a low-resolution, smooth velocity model along with a simple, conceptual fault model. Using optimized correlation-based full-waveform inversion, wavefield-separation-based reverse-time migration, and automatic fault detection techniques, we present 3D seismic characterization for the Soda Lake geothermal field using 3D surface seismic data acquired with Vibroseis sources. Here, we obtain 3D high-resolution velocity, density, and acoustic impedance models, 3D seismic images with different grid spacings, and a high-resolution fault system. Consistency check between the constructed faults and currently active injection and production geothermal wells verifies that our seismic inversion and imaging results and detected faults are reliable. These results can provide valuable information for optimizing well placement and geothermal energy production at the Soda Lake geothermal field.","Elsevier","","Los Alamos National Lab.

"The Potential to Improve the Value of U.S. Geothermal Electricity Generation Through Flexible Operations","Millstein, Dev; Dobson, Patrick; Jeong, Seongeun","15 GEOTHERMAL ENERGY; alternative energy sources; geothermal energy; geothermal engineering; geothermal power stations; solar energy; wind; renewable energy; geothermal power","Geothermal power plants have typically been operated as baseload plants. The recent expansion of wind and solar power generation creates a potential opportunity to increase the value of geothermal generation through flexible operations. In recent years, California’s wholesale electricity markets have exhibited frequent, short-term periods of negative pricing, indicating that additional flexibility would be valued in the market. Here, we examine local nodal hourly price records at all geothermal plants located in the western United States. We describe how the frequency and temporal characteristics of negative pricing episodes have changed over recent years. Based on these price series, we calculate the value of multiple strategies of flexible operations. Additionally, we use the estimates of future prices, developed through a capacity-expansion model and a dispatch model, to explore how the value of such flexible operations might change along with further penetration of variable renewable power sources. Based on the historical pricing records, we find that simple curtailment of operations during negative pricing episodes could increase the average energy value by 1–2 dollars per MWh and that allowing for increased production during limited high-priced hours, in addition to curtailment during negative priced hours, could potentially double the increase in value (up to 4 dollars per MWh). The forward-looking simulations indicate reduced values of flexibility from geothermal power despite higher penetrations of variable renewable energy. This result highlights the possibility that increasing flexibility options throughout the system may counteract the influence of increased variable renewable energy deployment.","ASME","","Lawrence Berkeley National Lab.

"In-Situ Stress Measurements at the Utah Frontier Observatory for Research in Geothermal Energy (FORGE) Site","Xing, Pengju; McLennan, John; Moore, Joseph","15 GEOTHERMAL ENERGY; energy & fuels; in-situ stress; enhanced geothermal system (EGS); FORGE; DFIT","A scientific injection campaign was conducted at the Utah Frontier Observatory for Research in Geothermal Energy (FORGE) site in 2017 and 2019. The testing included pump-in/shut-in, pump-in/flowback, and step rate tests. Various methods have been employed to interpret the in-situ stress from the test dataset. This study focuses on methods to interpret the minimum in-situ stress from step rate, pump-in/extended shut-in tests data obtained during the stimulation of two zones in Well 58-32. This well was drilled in low-permeability granitoid. A temperature of 199 °C was recorded at the well’s total depth of 2297 m relative to the rotary Kelly bushing (RKB). The lower zone (Zone 1) consisted of 46 m of the openhole at the toe of the well. Fractures in the upper zone (Zone 2) were stimulated between 2123–2126 m measured depths (MD) behind the casing. The closure stress gradient variation depended on the depth and the injection chronology. The closure stress was found to increase with the pumping rate/volume. This stress variation could indicate that poroelastic effects (“back stress”) and the presence of adjacent natural fractures may play an important role in the interpretation of fracture closure stress. Further, progressively increasing local total stresses may, consequently, have practical applications when moderate volumes of fluid are injected in a naturally fractured or high-temperature reservoir. The alternative techniques that use pump-in/flowback tests and temperature signatures provide a valuable perspective view of the in-situ stress measurements.","MDPI","","Univ. of Utah, Salt Lake City, UT (United States)","USDOE Office of Energy Efficiency and Renewable Energy (EERE)","","United States","2020-11-09T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: Energies; Journal Volume: 13; Journal Issue: 21","","Medium: ED; Size: Article No. 5842","","","EE0007080","Journal ID: ISSN 1996-1073; ENERGA; PII: en13215842","10.3390/en13215842","","2022-04-26T00:00:00Z","1848474","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/1848474","https://www.osti.gov/servlets/purl/1848474","Energies","21","13"
"Using saline or brackish aquifers as reservoirs for thermal energy storage, with example calculations for direct-use heating in the Portland Basin, Oregon, USA","Burns, Erick R.; Bershaw, John; Williams, Colin F.; Wells, Ray; Uddenberg, Matt; Scanlon, Darby; Cladouhos, Trenton; van Houten, Boz","15 GEOTHERMAL ENERGY; Thermal energy storage; Geothermal; Reservoir Thermal Energy Storage (RTES)","Tools to evaluate reservoir thermal energy storage (RTES; heat storage in slow-moving or stagnant geochemically evolved permeable zones in strata that underlie well-connected regional aquifers) are developed and applied to the Columbia River Basalt Group (CRBG) beneath the Portland Basin, Oregon, USA. The performance of RTES for heat storage and recovery in the Portland Basin is strongly dependent on the operational schedule of heat injection and extraction. We examined the effects of the operational schedule, based on an annual solar hot water supply pattern and a building heating demand model, using heat and fluid flow simulations with SUTRA. We show RTES to be feasible for supply of heating energy for a large combined research/teaching building on the Oregon Health and Science University South Waterfront expansion, an area of planned future development. Initially, heat is consumed to increase the reservoir temperature, and conductive heat loss is high due to high temperature gradients between the reservoir and surrounding rock. Conductive heat loss continues into the future, but the rate of heat loss decreases, and heat recovery efficiency of the RTES system increases over time. Simulations demonstrate the effects of varying heat-delivery rate and temperature on the heat production history of the reservoir. If 100% of building heating needs are to be supplied by combined solar/RTES, then the solar system must be sized to meet building needs plus long-term thermal losses (i.e., conductive losses once the system is heated to pseudo-steady state) from the RTES system. If the solar heating system barely meets these criteria, then during early years, less than 100% of the building demand will be supplied until the reservoir is fully-heated. The duration of supplying less than 100% of building demand can be greatly shortened by pre-heating the reservoir before building heating operations or by adding extra heat from external sources during early years. Analytic solutions are developed to evaluate efficacy and to help design RTES systems (e.g., well-spacing, thermal source sizing, etc.). A map of thermal energy storage capacity is produced for the CRBG beneath the Portland Basin. The simulated building has an annual heat load of ~1.9 GWh, and the total annual storage capacity of the Portland Basin is estimated to be 43,400 GWh assuming seasonal storage of heat yields water from which 10 °C can be extracted via heat exchange, indicating a tremendous heating capacity of the CRBG.","Elsevier","","US Geological Survey, Portland, OR (United States)","USDOE Office of Energy Efficiency and Renewable Energy (EERE), Renewable Power Office.

Optimal selection and operation of heat pumps can significantly improve system performance. To support this analysis, we model the quantitative relationships between heat pump configurations and source flow, supply and distribution temperatures, facility heating design options, output heat generation, and carbon abatement outcomes. A systems approach is used for analysis, troubleshooting, and improvement of the model. The result of this effort is a dynamic tool that appropriately responds to hourly thermal demand and communicates energy response for techno-economic analysis. Simulations indicate that a single well-pair in the local Basement Contact Zone reservoir can satisfy almost 68% of annual thermal demand at nearly 20 MWth average capacity while remaining financially competitive compared to conventional heating with levelized cost of heating (LCOH) as low as $4.55/MMBTU ($15.53/MWh<sub>th</sub>). A direct-use scheme with heat pump augmentation provided more carbon abatement and 50 to 150% more annual heat supply than one without augmentation.

"Simulating Fracture Sealing by Granular LCM Particles in Geothermal Drilling","Lee, Lu (ORCID:0000000231214277); Dahi Taleghani, Arash","15 GEOTHERMAL ENERGY; Energy & Fuels; lost circulation; bridging; CFD–DEM; drilling fluid; fracture sealing; geothermal drilling","<p>Lost circulation occurs when the returned fluid is less than what is pumped into the well due to loss of fluid to pores or fractures. A lost-circulation event is a common occurrence in a geothermal well. Typical geothermal reservoirs are often under-pressured and have larger fracture apertures. A severe lost-circulation event is costly and may lead to stuck pipe, well instability, and well abandonment. One typical treatment is adding lost-circulation materials (LCMs) to seal fractures. Conventional LCMs fail to properly seal fractures because their mechanical limit is exceeded at elevated temperatures. In this paper, parametric studies in numerical simulations are conducted to better understand different thermal effects on the sealing mechanisms of LCMs. The computational fluid dynamics (CFDs) and the discrete element method (DEM) are coupled to accurately capture the true physics of sealing by granular materials. Due to computational limits, the traditional Eulerian–Eulerian approach treats solid particles as a group of continuum matter. With the advance of modern computational power, particle bridging is achievable with DEM to track individual particles by modeling their interactive forces between each other. Particle–fluid interactions can be modeled by coupling CFD algorithms. Fracture sealing capability is investigated by studying the effect of four individual properties including fluid viscosity, particle size, friction coefficient, and Young’s modulus. It is found that thermally degraded properties lead to inefficient fracture sealing.</p>","MDPI AG","","Univ. of Oklahoma, Norman, OK (United States)","USDOE Office of Nuclear Energy (NE); USDOE Office of Energy Efficiency and Renewable Energy (EERE)","","Switzerland","2020-09-17T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: Energies (Basel) Journal Volume: 13 Journal Issue: 18","","Medium: X; Size: Article No. 4878","","","DE EE0008602; EE0008602","Journal ID: ISSN 1996-1073; ENERGA; PII: en13184878","10.3390/en13184878","","2021-04-21T00:00:00Z","1664454","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/1664454","","Energies (Basel)","18","13"

The complexity and high-dimensionality of many process-level models, especially those used for geosystem energy exploration and utilization, often lead to formidable computational costs when the dimension of decision space is also large. This work adopts elements of recently advanced deep learning techniques to solve a sequential decision-making problem in applied geosystem management. Specifically, a deep reinforcement learning framework was formed for optimal multiperiod planning, in which a deep Q-learning network (DQN) agent was trained to maximize rewards by learning from high-dimensional inputs and from exploitation of its past experiences. To expedite computation, deep multitask learning was used to approximate high-dimensional, multistate transition functions. Both DQN and deep multitask learning are pattern based. As a demonstration, the framework was applied to optimal carbon sequestration reservoir planning using two different types of management strategies: monitoring only and brine extraction. Both strategies are designed to mitigate potential risks due to pressure buildup. Results show that the DQN agent can identify the optimal policies to maximize the reward for given risk and cost constraints. Experiments also show that knowledge the agent gained from interacting with one environment is largely preserved when deploying the same agent in other similar environments.","Elsevier","","Univ. of Texas, Austin, TX (United States)","USDOE Office of Fossil Energy (FE)","","United States","2020-08-10T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: Applied Energy; Journal Volume: 278; Journal Issue: C","","Medium: ED; Size: Article No. 115660","","","FE0026515","Journal ID: ISSN 0306-2619; PII: S0306261920311569","10.1016/j.apenergy.2020.115660","","2022-06-16T00:00:00Z","1849181","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/1849181","https://www.osti.gov/servlets/purl/1849181","Applied Energy","C","278"

C.; Bathija, Arpita P.","15 GEOTHERMAL ENERGY; geothermal; geothermal energy; renewable","Geothermal energy is a global renewable resource that has the potential to provide a significant portion of baseload energy in many regions. In the United States, it has the potential to provide 8.5% of the electric generation capacity by the middle of the century. In general, geothermal systems require heat, permeability, and water to be viable for energy generation. However, with current technologies, only heat is strictly necessary in a native system. Engineered geothermal systems (EGS) introduce water into the subsurface at elevated pressures and reduced temperatures and enhance permeability through hydraulic and/or shear fracturing. Additionally, although moderate- to high-temperature resources currently dominate geothermal energy production, low-temperature resources have been utilized for direct-use cases. When well balanced and maintained, geothermal resources can produce significant amounts of heat and achieve long-term sustainability on the order of an estimated tens to hundreds of years.","Society of Exploration Geophysicists, SEG","External Audience (Unlimited)","Lawrence Livermore National Lab.

"Cements with supplementary cementitious materials for high-temperature geothermal wells","Pyatina, Tatiana; Sugama, Toshifumi","15 GEOTHERMAL ENERGY","This paper discusses self-healing ability, characterized by the strength recovery and crack sealing, thermal shock and acid resistance of several cementitious composites in water, alkali carbonate or geothermal brine at 300 °C. The tested formulations included a common high-temperature OPC/SiO<sub>2</sub> formulation, a calcium-aluminate cement with alkali activated FAF blend (TSRC), alkali-activated granulated blast furnace slag (GBFS/SiO<sub>2</sub>) and fly ash C/fly ash F (FAC/FAF) cementitious blends. Compressive strength recoveries and visual observations of cracks sealing using 3D imaging after the compressive damage and then after the 5-day healing period were used to evaluate the self-healing abilities of these composites. The strength recoveries were evaluated for composites after 1-, 5-, 10-, 15-, and 30- day initial curing periods at 300 °C and after repeated damage and 5-day healing treatments. The nature of the failure was classified depending on the Young’s modulus (YM) of the tested blends. Composites with moderate values of YM, such as OPC/SiO<sub>2</sub> and TSRC developed slim cracks while brittle and very brittle FAC/FAF and GBFS/SiO<sub>2</sub> cementitious blends produced multidirectional cracks or near-fragment failures resulting in poor strength recoveries. In comparison with the common high-temperature OPC/SiO<sub>2</sub> blend, composites with alkali activated pozzolanic materials demonstrated a decrease in crack size during the short healing periods. Fly ash-containing composites showed better acid resistance surviving 28 days in sulfuric acid (pH 0.2) at 90 °C. The TSRC demonstrated the best thermal shock resistance losing only about 20 % of the original strength in five 350 °C heat→25 °C water thermal cycles. In all the tests the TSRC outperformed the rest of the composites with average strength recoveries of more than 85 %. Alkali carbonate was the most favorable for both strength recovery and crack sealing. The short-term strength recoveries could be further improved to above 100 % by addition of micro-glass fibers (MGF). However, the MGF raised the brittleness of the samples after longer initial curing times, which decreased recovery rates of the aged samples. Crystalline phase analysis demonstrated that different products assisted in strength recoveries and crack sealing. The later included for the most part silica and analcime while the former were hydrogrossulars (ferrian) with various stoichiometries, iron-magnesium minerals, cancrinite, quartz and boehmite. These phases formed thanks to the slow high-temperature alkaline reactions of fly ash and glass fibers for MGF-modified samples.","Elsevier","","Brookhaven National Lab.

Previous studies have sought to understand reservoir response to geothermal production and optimize production rates to maximize lifetime profits of geothermal reservoirs; however, these studies largely overlook the uncertainty in subsurface structure, such as the number of preferential flow pathways (e.g., fractures) that are available for fluid and heat transport. We present a combination of simple analytical models that maximize the profits of an idealized synthetic geothermal reservoir, while considering reservoir structural uncertainty, using expected net present value. For a typical case, we find that effective reservoir transmissivity and inter-well spacing exert the largest controls on the lifetime profitability of an idealized geothermal reservoir, and for a given reservoir there exists a critical number of hydraulically active fractures beyond which additional fractures provide no increase in lifetime profits. Given initial reservoir characterization data, our model simulates reservoir performance that predicts financial outcomes, which operators can use during initial exploration stage. These predictions are also useful during normal operations to consider strategies, such as drilling make-up wells, to mitigate the effects of production-induced thermal drawdown.","Elsevier","","Univ. of Wisconsin, Madison, WI (United States)","USDOE Office of Energy Efficiency and Renewable Energy (EERE), Renewable Power Office.

We excavated a paleoseismic trench across the GCF in the populated northern Willamette Valley and document three surface-rupturing earthquakes from stratigraphic and structural relationships. Radiocarbon samples from offset stratigraphy constrain these earthquakes to have occurred ~1000, ~4200, and ~8800 calibrated years before the present. The penultimate earthquake back–tilted a buried soil into the hillslope creating accommodation space that was infilled by a colluvial deposit. The most recent earthquake faulted and formed a fissure within the penultimate colluvial deposit. Our results suggest that the GCF has a recurrence interval of ~4000 yr, and if the full 73 km length were to rupture, it would result in an M<sub>w</sub> 7.1–7.4 earthquake, providing a significant seismic hazard for the greater Portland metropolitan area.","Seismological Society of America","","Portland State Univ., OR (United States)","USDOE Office of Energy Efficiency and Renewable Energy (EERE), Renewable Power Office.

This study of curtailment at The Geysers provides insights into the magnitude, duration, frequency, temporal and spatial distribution, and potential causes of curtailment events between 2013 and 2018. Annual levels of curtailment range during this period from 9 to 47 GW h, representing 0.15 to 0.81 % of the net generation. Most curtailments occurred at the power plants connected to a lower capacity transmission line and may result from transmission constriction. There is a clear link between negative pricing and economic curtailment, especially when solar production is higher. Economic curtailment events tend to be only a few hours and vary in magnitude up to almost 300 MW, whereas transmission-related curtailment events can be up to several weeks in duration. It is likely that curtailment of geothermal power will be an increasing concern, and could be mitigated by flexible generation strategies and increases in energy storage.

"Modeling study of deep direct use geothermal on the West Virginia university campus-morgantown, WV","Zhang, Yingqi; Garapati, Nagasree; Doughty, Christine; Jeanne, Pierre","15 GEOTHERMAL ENERGY; Deep Direct-use geothermal; Numerical simulations; Prediction uncertainty; Heterogeneity","To reduce the geothermal exploration risk, a feasibility study is performed for a deep direct-use (DDU) system proposed at the West Virginia University (WVU) Morgantown campus. This study applies numerical simulations to investigate reservoir impedance and thermal production. Because of the great depth of the geothermal reservoir, few data are available to characterize reservoir features and properties. Consequently, the study focuses on the following three aspects: 1. model choice for predicting reservoir impedance and thermal breakthrough: after investigating three potential models (one single permeability model and two dual permeability models) for flow through fractured rock, it is decided only the single permeability model is needed; 2. well placement (horizontal vs. vertical) options: horizontal well placement seems to be more robust to heterogeneity and the impedance is more acceptable; 3. Prediction uncertainty: the most influential parameters are identified using a First-Order-Second-Moment uncertainty propagation analysis, and the uncertain range of the model predictions is estimated by performing a Monte Carlo simulation. Heterogeneity has a large impact on the prediction, therefore, heterogeneity is included in the predictive model and uncertainty analysis. The numerical model results and uncertainty analysis will be used for further economic studies.","Elsevier","","Lawrence Berkeley National Lab.

"An embedded 3D fracture modeling approach for simulating fracture-dominated fluid flow and heat transfer in geothermal reservoirs","Wang, Cong; Winterfeld, Philip; Johnston, Henry; Wu, Yu-Shu","15 GEOTHERMAL ENERGY; geothermal; geothermal reservoir; reservoir simulation; fracture simulation; EDFM","In this paper, we describe an efficient modeling approach, named embedded discrete fracture method (EDFM), for incorporating arbitrary 3D, discrete fractures, such as hydraulic fractures or faults, into modeling fracture-dominated fluid flow and heat transfer in fractured geothermal reservoirs. This technique allows 3D discrete fractures to be discretized independently from surrounding rock volume and inserted explicitly into a primary fracture/matrix grid, generated without including 3D discrete fractures in prior. An effective computational algorithm is developed to discretize these 3D discrete fractures and construct local connections between 3D fractures and fracture/matrix grid blocks representing the surrounding rock volume. The constructed gridding information on 3D fractures is then added to the primary grid. This embedded fracture modeling approach can be directly implemented into a developed geothermal reservoir simulator via the integral finite difference (IFD) method or with TOUGH2 technology. This embedded fracture modeling approach is very promising and computationally efficient to handle realistic 3D discrete fractures with complicated geometries, connections, and spatial distributions. Compared with other fracture modeling approaches, it avoids cumbersome 3D unstructured, local refining procedures, and increases computational efficiency by simplifying Jacobian matrix size and sparsity, while maintaining enough accuracy. Several numeral simulations are presented to demonstrate the utility and robustness of the proposed technique. Our numerical experiments show that this approach captures all the key patterns about fluid flow and heat transfer dominated by fractures in these cases. Thus, this approach is readily available to the simulation of fractured geothermal reservoirs with both artificial and natural fractures.","Elsevier","","National Renewable Energy Lab.

"Assessing geothermal/solar hybridization – Integrating a solar thermal topping cycle into a geothermal bottoming cycle with energy storage","McTigue, Joshua Dominic P.; Wendt, Daniel; Kitz, Kevin; Gunderson, Joshua; Kincaid, Nicholas D.; Zhu, Guangdong","15 GEOTHERMAL ENERGY; 29 ENERGY PLANNING, POLICY, AND ECONOMY; geothermal power; concentrating solar power; thermal energy storage; retrofit; levelized cost of electricity; hybrid power plant","Geothermal and concentrating solar power (CSP) technologies typically use heat at different temperatures in their commercial deployments. This enables a technically viable hybridization of a solar topping cycle and a geothermal bottoming cycle at locations where both resources are available. In this article, an underperforming geothermal power system based at Burley, Idaho is used as a baseline to investigate the technical and economic potential of such a hybrid cycle. A direct thermal energy storage (TES) system is also integrated to overcome the intermittency of the solar resource. Design and off-design behavior of key components are modelled to simulate the annual performance of the hybrid system on an hourly basis. The sizing of the solar field and thermal storage is investigated and is seen to significantly impact the annual electricity generation and efficiency. Various cost scenarios for the solar field and thermal energy storage are investigated. An economic metric - levelized cost of electricity (LCOE) - is used to optimize the solar field sizing and TES capacity. The hybrid plant converts the additional solar heat input into additional work with an efficiency of 32.9%. Retrofitting a geothermal plant with solar and eight hours of energy storage can achieve an LCOE of 0.136 $/kWhe in current cost scenarios and 0.081 $/kWhe in a future cost reduction scenario. Although the hybrid system cannot directly compete with current PV systems without batteries, it has an LCOE 32% lower than that of a PV-battery system. This paper provides insights into the research and development of the future grid with a high renewable energy penetration and encourages further study of energy hybridization for improved efficiencies and economics.","Elsevier","","National Renewable Energy Lab.

Coupled ultrasonic and permeability measurements are presented for Westerly granite samples fractured in situ and used to illuminate the relationship between nonlinear dynamic stiffness and fracture permeability indexed via fracture aperture. We perturb the effective stress field using normal stress and pore pressure oscillations. The velocity of ultrasonic waves transmitted across the fracture is used to infer the evolution of elastic properties and the fracture nonlinearity. Changes in permeability are measured concurrently. We observe that relative changes in wave velocity and permeability, due to both normal stress and pore pressure oscillations, are correlated, such that larger drops in wave velocity (higher nonlinearity) correspond to larger increases in permeability. Furthermore, our observations suggest that dynamic stressing is more likely to enhance the permeability of fractures that exhibit greater nonlinearity.","American Geophysical Union","","Pennsylvania State Univ., University Park, PA (United States)","USDOE Office of Science (SC), Basic Energy Sciences (BES)","","United States","2019-12-09T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: Geophysical Research Letters; Journal Volume: 47; Journal Issue: 1","","Medium: ED","","","SC0017585","Journal ID: ISSN 0094-8276","10.1029/2019gl083557","","2021-05-31T00:00:00Z","1784566","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/1784566","https://www.osti.gov/servlets/purl/1784566","Geophysical Research Letters","1","47"

Nevertheless, due to the transient nature of solar energy, transitions from solar-only mode and natural-gas mode to hybrid solar-natural gas mode is quite challenging, especially when the plant is equipped with thermal storage. Thus, it is important to develop proper dynamic modeling and control schemes to accurately simulate such transitions. The objective of this study is to address this subject by demonstrating a dynamic model with reliable control schemes for a highly integrated hybrid parabolic trough-natural gas plant equipped with thermal energy storage. The specific goal is to study the dynamics of adding thermal storage to the hybrid plant. It is found that the developed control schemes assist smooth transitions between different operational modes and effective utilization of thermal storage and natural gas to maintain steady power production and steam mass flow rates under different solar conditions. The results demonstrate that the integration of storage regulates power production by solar energy and natural gas during the day time. It also enables an increase in the solar fraction of the hybrid plant while it causes a small decrease in thermodynamic efficiency. The analysis shows that the hybrid plant with the storage has a substantially lower specific CO<sub>2</sub> emission (0.320 tonne/MWh) than single natural gas plant (0.413 tonne/MWh) although it has a higher levelized cost of electricity (86.32/MWh against 74.92/MWh). The hybrid plant with storage demonstrates a promising potential for reliable and clean production of electricity, although research and development should be conducted to lower its cost.","Elsevier","","Univ. of Utah, Salt Lake City, UT (United States)","USDOE Office of Energy Efficiency and Renewable Energy (EERE), Energy Efficiency Office.

We compare the efficacy of a matched field processing algorithm with a multi-channel waveform correlation algorithm. Both methods identified between 60%–80% more events, with each slightly outperforming the other in different seismic noise contexts. Incorporating either template-matching technique into a seismic processing routine could therefore effectively increase the sensitivity of the seismic network without changes to the existing hardware. Additionally, lowering the magnitude of completeness would significantly add to the number of events that could subsequently inform future decision making at the reservoir level.","Elsevier","","Lawrence Livermore National Lab.

However, many fundamental transport parameters of h-BN, including the room temperature carrier mobility, minority carrier lifetime, and surface recombination velocity, which are essential to the performance of detectors, are still unknown. Here, we report here the carrier drift mobilities (<em>μ</em>) and lifetimes (τ) of both electrons and holes in h-<sup>10</sup>BN epilayers measured by using a time-of-flight (TOF) technique. Lateral photoconductive type detectors fabricated from a 65 μm thick freestanding h-<sup>10</sup>BN epilayer were utilized to carry out the TOF measurements, which revealed <em>μ</em><sub>e</sub> ~34 cm<sup>2</sup>/V s for electrons and <em>μ</em><sub>h</sub> ~36 cm<sup>2</sup>/V s for holes and carrier lifetimes on the order of tens of microseconds. By combining the values of μ measured from TOF with <em>S</em>/μ (the ratio of the surface recombination velocity to mobility) deduced directly from the bias voltage dependence of photocurrent, S for both electrons (<em>S</em><sub>e</sub> ~1.4 × 10<sup>4</sup> cm/s) and holes (<em>S</em><sub>h</sub> ~2.7 × 10<sup>3</sup> cm/s) in h-<sup>10</sup>BN has been extracted.

However, solutions from numerical schemes always suffer from numerical diffusion and/or oscillation. In this study, we develop an Intra-Cell Advection Tracking (ICAT) scheme to minimize numerical diffusion and preserve monotonicity for advection-dispersion modeling. The key idea is to introduce “queues” in each discretized cell, and using a sequential transport rule and a flow distribution mechanism to track the scalar transport in these queues temporally and spatially. The capability and limitations of ICAT are first investigated through three test cases. Compared with the results obtained from other numerical schemes, the results from ICAT show substantially reduced numerical diffusion and agree better with analytical solutions. We also employ ICAT to simulate the transport process of a conservative tracer in a fracture with a highly heterogeneous aperture distribution. We report discrete flow channels in the fracture are better discerned by ICAT than by other numerical schemes, indicating the suitability of ICAT for modeling tracer transport in channelized flow fields.","Elsevier","External Audience (Unlimited)","Lawrence Livermore National Lab.

A key limitation of LUT-based damage studies to date is the lack of explicit evidence used in associating material damage with the changes in measured LUT attributes (e.g., ultrasonic wave amplitude and velocity). In this study, the evolution of the full-field strains in brittle rock specimens (Lyons sandstone) subjected to failure are analyzed in real time and linked with the changes in the ultrasonic wave amplitude in localized areas illuminated by ultrasonic beams, termed as the ultrasonic image areas. The noncontact optical full-field displacement measurement method of 2-D digital image correlation is implemented in combination with the LUT procedure to continuously track changes in the ultrasonic wave amplitude with the evolution of strains across the surface of the uniaxially loaded intact rock specimens.

The results from the study corroborate that the ultrasonic changes are in fact influenced by the regions of tensile cracking, which is the primary inelastic deformation mechanism in brittle rocks.","American Geophysical Union","","Colorado School of Mines, Golden, CO (United States)","USDOE Office of Science (SC), Basic Energy Sciences (BES).

"Microseismic Focal Mechanisms and Implications for Changes in Stress during the 2014 Newberry EGS Stimulation","Aguiar, Ana C.; Myers, Stephen C.","58 GEOSCIENCES; 15 GEOTHERMAL ENERGY","<p>We adapt the relative polarity method from Shelly et al. (2016) to compute focal mechanisms for microearthquakes associated with the 2014 hydroshearing stimulation at the Newberry volcano geothermal site. We focus the analysis on events relocated by Aguiar and Myers (2018), who report that six event clusters predominantly comprise the 2014 sequence. Data quality allows focal mechanism analysis for four of the six event clusters. We use Hardebeck and Shearer (2002, 2003; hereafter HASH) to compute focal mechanisms based on first–motion polarities and S/P amplitude ratios. We manually determine P– and S–wave polarities for a well–recorded reference event in each cluster, then use waveform cross correlation to determine whether recordings of other events in the cluster are the same or reversed polarity at each network station. Here, most waveform polarities are consistent with the affiliated reference event, indicating similar focal mechanisms within each cluster. The deeper clusters are east–west–striking normal faults, whereas the shallower clusters, close to the top of the open–hole section of the borehole, are strike slip with east–west motion. Regional studies and prestimulation borehole breakouts find the maximum stress direction is vertical and maximum horizontal stress is approximately north–south. Fault geometry and focal mechanisms of microseismicity during the stimulation suggest that increased pressure from fluid injection predominantly caused changes in horizontal stress, consistent with predictions from numerical studies of stress change caused by fluid injection. At shallow depths, where previous studies suggest the difference between vertical and horizontal stress is lowest, injection appears to have rotated the direction of maximum stress from vertical to horizontal, resulting in strike–slip motion. At greater depth, vertical stress continued to be the dominant direction during the stimulation, but fault orientation indicates either reactivation of pre–existing fractures or rotation of the direction of maximum horizontal stress from approximately north–south to east–west.</p>","Seismological Society of America","External Audience (Unlimited)","Lawrence Livermore National Lab.

These sensors calculate the strain (or strain rate) at all points along the fiber and have been used extensively to monitor hydraulic stimulations. The data from these sensors indicate that they are sensitive to high-frequency signals associated with microseismicity and low-frequency signals associated with fracture growth. We have developed a set of idealized models to simulate these signals and to identify interpretation methods that may be used to estimate fracture location, geometry, and extent. We use a multiphysics code that includes rock physics, fluid flow, and elastic-wave propagation to generate synthetic DAS measurements from a set of simple models that mimic hydraulic fracturing. We then relate the signals observed in the synthetic DAS to specific features in the model such as fracture height, width, and aperture. Our results demonstrate that the synthetic DAS measurements may be used to determine field DAS measurements and to optimize the design of future sensor deployments for sensitivity to fracture attributes.","","External Audience (Unlimited)","Lawrence Livermore National Lab.

In particular, very complex structural settings, consisting of many closely spaced and intersecting faults, host many geothermal systems. To elucidate the key geologic factors that affect fault-controlled geothermal circulation, it is critical to precisely characterize the structural and stratigraphic geometries in these complex settings. Here, we present a methodology and the results of 3D geologic analyses of two geothermal systems in the Basin and Range, USA. This methodology is a quantitative and geologically focused technique that can be used to precisely characterize geothermal areas, in a time when future geothermal growth demands increased exploration precision and efficiency. Surficial and subsurface geologic and geophysical data are synthesized in the construction of detailed 3D geologic maps of geothermal areas. Based on these 3D geologic maps, we examine several geologic attributes that control permeability development and geothermal fluid flow along faults. We use the stress state of faults and the distribution of structural discontinuities (i.e., fault intersections and fault terminations) to identify locations of upflow along faults in these geothermal systems. These results and the methodology presented herein are directly applicable to structurally controlled geothermal fields in the Basin and Range and worldwide. As development focus shifts toward blind geothermal resources, integration of precisely characterized subsurface structural information into exploration methods will be increasingly critical to continued growth in geothermal exploration and development.","Springer","","Univ. of Nevada, Reno, NV (United States); Univ. of California, Oakland, CA (United States)","USDOE Office of Energy Efficiency and Renewable Energy (EERE)","","United States","2019-01-29T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: Geothermal Energy; Journal Volume: 7; Journal Issue: 1","","Medium: ED; Size: Article No. 2","","","EE0002748; FG36-02ID14311; AC02-05CH11231","Journal ID: ISSN 2195-9706; PII: 117","10.1186/s40517-018-0117-0","","2021-08-03T00:00:00Z","1613266","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/1613266","https://www.osti.gov/servlets/purl/1613266","Geothermal Energy","1","7"

Accurate characterization of stimulated hydraulic fractures has significant scientific and practical value but remains practically challenging. We introduce a novel templated electrical resistivity tomography (TERT) method to estimate both the extents and aperture of a hydraulic fracture through two key innovations. First, unlike the traditional ERT methods which image the perturbed electrical resistivity field, TERT images the perturbation to the smooth background field, where the perturbation is a planar feature caused by the hydraulic fracture in a 3D space. Moreover, we maximize the use of a priori information of the fracture and minimize the parameter space by using geometric templates to characterize the fracture. A hypothetical elliptical fracture in a 3D model as well as a field-scale hydraulic fracture corresponding to a typical reservoir stimulation scenario are successfully imaged with TERT.","Elsevier","External Audience (Unlimited)","Lawrence Livermore National Lab.

"Heat losses associated with the upward flow of air, water, CO<sub>2</sub> in geothermal production wells","Phuoc, Tran X.; Massoudi, Mehrdad; Wang, Ping; McKoy, Mark L.","15 GEOTHERMAL ENERGY","This present work reports on the heat losses associated with the upward flow of hot air, water, and CO<sub>2</sub> in a production well. The heat losses considered here are the frictional heat loss, the gravitational heat loss, the Joule-Thomson effect, and the conduction heat loss to the surrounding rock formation. These heat losses were characterized using the mass flow rate, the operation time as variable parameters while the surrounding formation was assumed to have constant properties with a linear geothermal gradient. The results show that, the frictional heat loss was small while the influences of the others depended on the flow conditions and the operation time. For water, the Joule-Thomson effect was a heating effect and its magnitude was comparable to that due to the gravitational effect. The conduction heat loss was dominant for all situations. For air as well as CO<sub>2</sub>, the Joule-Thomson effects were the cooling effects. For low mass flow rates, the conduction heat loss was the dominant heat loss during the initial stages of the operation and the combined heat losses due to the gravitational and the Joule-Thomson effects became dominant during the later times. For high mass flow rates, throughout the operation life time, the gravitational and the Joule-Thomson effects were the dominant heat losses that control the temperature of air and CO<sub>2</sub> in the production well.","Elsevier","","National Energy Technology Laboratory (NETL), Pittsburgh, PA, Morgantown, WV, and Albany, OR (United States)","USDOE Office of Fossil Energy (FE)","","United States","2019-04-01T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: International Journal of Heat and Mass Transfer; Journal Volume: 132; Journal Issue: C","","Medium: ED; Size: p. 249-258","","NETL-PUB-22197","","Journal ID: ISSN 0017-9310","10.1016/j.ijheatmasstransfer.2018.11.168","","2020-04-01T00:00:00Z","1569822","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/1569822","https://www.osti.gov/servlets/purl/1569822","International Journal of Heat and Mass Transfer","C","132"
"Characterizing volumetric strain at Brady Hot Springs, Nevada, USA using geodetic data, numerical models and prior information","Reinisch, Elena C.; Cardiff, Michael; Feigl, Kurt L.","15 GEOTHERMAL ENERGY; Satellite geodesy; Transient deformation; Numerical solutions; Spatial analysis","The geothermal field at Brady Hot Springs, Nevada has subsided over the past decade. Between 2004 and 2014, the rate of downward-vertical displacement was on the order of 10 mm yr<sup>-1</sup>, as measured by two independent geodetic techniques: interferometric synthetic aperture radar (InSAR) and Global Positioning System. The observed deformation field forms an approximately elliptical bowl that is 4 km long and aligned with the trace of the NNE striking normal fault system. We use modelling to estimate the plausibility of pressure changes or thermal contraction as the cause of the observed subsidence. As a result, Bayesian inference favours with ‘very strong evidence’ thermal contraction over other hypotheses as the dominant driving mechanism for the observed subsidence. Using InSAR data spanning from 2016 July 22 to 2017 August 22, we estimate the volume change rate in the significantly deforming volume to be (-29 ± 3) thousand m<sup>3</sup> yr<sup>-1</sup> and the total rate of change in thermal energy between -53 and -79 MW. We infer the total volume of cubes where the estimated volumetric strain rate is significantly different from zero with 95 per cent confidence to be 119 million m<sup>3</sup>. We find that the main region of significant cooling occurs between the injection and production well locations. This result supports the idea that highly permeable conduits along faults channel fluids from shallow aquifers to the deep reservoir tapped by the production wells.","Oxford University Press","","Univ. of Wisconsin, Madison, WI (United States); Temple Univ., Philadelphia, PA (United States)","USDOE Office of Energy Efficiency and Renewable Energy (EERE), Renewable Power Office.

However, there remain open questions about the mass and energy budgets, water recharge rates and residence time in the subsurface, origin of dissolved solutes, and processes affecting the phase and chemical composition of groundwater and surface water. Here we measured and sampled surface manifestations of the geothermal system (geysers, perpetual spouters, mud pools/volcanoes, and non-eruptive hot springs) and meteoric water. From the isotopic composition we infer that the thermal water has a meteoric origin that is different from the composition of local meteoric water. The absence of detectable tritium in thermal waters indicates that most of the recharge occurred pre-1950. Boiling and steam separation from the deep reservoir appear to be the main subsurface processes affecting the thermal fluids. A large amount of heat is lost to the atmosphere by evaporation from surface water and by steam emitted from erupting geysers. Finally, using the chloride inventory method, we estimate thermal water discharge to be 218 to 234 L/s, and the advective heat flow to be 120 to 170 MW.","Elsevier","","Lawrence Berkeley National Lab.

Integrating heat from a concentrating solar power (CSP) collector field increases the power output at low cost. This article considers five methods of solar heat addition in a double-flash geothermal plant. The most promising solution converts solar heat into electrical work with an efficiency of 24.3%. The economic feasibility and optimal sizing of the solar field and thermal stores are evaluated. A hybrid plant that increases power generation from 22 to 24 MWe has a Levelized Cost of Electricity (LCOE) of 0.07 +/- 0.01 $/kWhe. Adding three hours of storage increases the LCOE to 0.08 +/- 0.01 $/kWhe. Photovoltaic systems are considered to be a low-cost renewable technology, but an equivalent photovoltaic system with battery storage costs 0.15 +/- 0.07 $/kWhe due to the high cost and replacement rate of batteries compared to thermal storage. The hybrid plant also has a lower LCOE than a conventional CSP plant. If the dispatchability that thermal storage provides is rewarded with higher electricity prices, calculations indicate storage becomes an attractive investment when discharged power receives 1.75 times the typical price of electricity.","Elsevier","","National Renewable Energy Lab.

L.","15 GEOTHERMAL ENERGY","We deployed a dense seismic array to image the shallow structure in the injection area of the Brady Hot Springs geothermal power plant in western Nevada. The array was composed of 238 three-component, 5 Hz nodal instruments, 8700 m of distributed acoustic sensing (DAS) fiber-optic cable (FOC) installed horizontally in surface trenches, and 400 m of FOC installed vertically in a borehole. The geophone array had about 60 m instrument spacing in the target zone, whereas DAS channel separations were about 1 m with an averaging (gauge) length of 10 m. The acquisition systems provided 15 days of continuous records, including active-source and ambient noise signals. A large vibroseis truck was operated at 196 locations, exciting a swept-frequency signal from 5 to 80 Hz over 20 s using three vibration modes (vertical, longitudinal, and transverse), with three sweeps per mode at each site. Sweeps were repeated up to four times at each site during four different stages of power plant operation: normal operation, shutdown, high and oscillatory injection and production, and normal operation. After removal of the sweep signal from the raw data, the first P-wave arrivals were automatically picked using a combination of methods. Here, the travel times were then used to invert for the 3D P-wave velocity structure. Models with 100 m horizontal and 20–50 m vertical node spacing were obtained, covering an area 2000 m by 1300 m, with acceptable resolution extending to about 250 m below surface. The travel-time data were fit to a root mean square (rms) misfit of 31 ms, close to our estimated picking uncertainty. Lateral boundaries between high and low velocity zones agree relatively well with the location of local faults from previous studies, and low near-surface velocities are associated with faults and fumarole locations. A sharp increase in velocity from < 1500 to > 2000 m/s at approximately 50 m below the ground surface in many parts of the study area may indicate a shallower water table than expected for the region.","Seismological Society of America","","Univ. of Wisconsin, Madison, WI (United States)","USDOE Office of Energy Efficiency and Renewable Energy (EERE), Renewable Power Office.

Clustering of 46,000 earthquakes of 0.3 < ML < 1.5 from the Geysers geothermal field (CA) yields groupings that have no reservoir-scale spatial patterns but clear temporal patterns. Events with similar spectral properties repeat on annual cycles within each cluster and track changes in the water injection rates into the Geysers reservoir, indicating that changes in acoustic properties and faulting processes accompany changes in thermomechanical state.

"Microseismic Event Relocation Based on PageRank Linkage at the Newberry Volcano Geothermal Site","Aguiar, Ana C.; Myers, Stephen C.","58 GEOSCIENCES; 15 GEOTHERMAL ENERGY","In this paper, we adapt the PageRank method to define signal-correlation topology for microearthquakes at the Newberry Volcano enhanced geothermal systems (EGS) demonstration in central Oregon. The Newberry EGS was stimulated in 2012 and 2014, producing hundreds of microearthquakes. Event locations based on P-wave and S-wave picks and a double-difference method resulted in diffuse clouds of seismicity for both stimulations (Foulger and Julian, 2013b; Cladouhos et al., 2016). We expand on the seismological application of PageRank (Aguiar and Beroza, 2014) to define event families based on signal-correlation topology and analyze each event family by measuring differential arrival times of P and S waves. We relocate each family using the Bayesloc method (Myers et al., 2007, 2009) and find that, after relocation, event families are tightly clustered spatially, indicating that the rock volume affected by stimulation was more than an order of magnitude smaller than would be inferred from double-difference analyses. Finally, relocation also reveals that most events occurred at the contacts between lithologic units, suggesting preferential fluid flow and hydroshearing along pre-existing weaknesses, as well as microseismic activity progressing away from the well with time.","Seismological Society of America","","Lawrence Livermore National Lab.

"Geodetic measurements and numerical models of transient deformation at Raft River geothermal field, Idaho, USA","Ali, Syed T.; Reinisch, Elena C.; Moore, Joseph; Plummer, Mitchell; Warren, Ian; Davatzes, Nicholas C.; Feigl, Kurt L.","15 GEOTHERMAL ENERGY; InSAR","Here, we perform synthetic aperture radar interferometry using data acquired between 2004 and 2016 by the Envisat, and ALOS-2 satellite missions to measure transient deformation at the Raft River geothermal field in Cassia County in Southern Idaho where geothermal production began in late 2007. Time-series analysis of multiple interferometric pairs indicates uplift at an exponentially decaying rate, over an ~8 km-by-5 km area centered near three injection wells that recycle produced brine. Similarly, subsidence at an exponentially decaying rate is observed in a 4 km-by-4 km area west of the production wells. These two signatures stay in the same location in all of the well-correlated Envisat interferometric pairs spanning the time interval between 2007 and 2010. The boundary separating the uplifting and subsiding areas is associated with the steeply dipping Bridge fault zone. Using two-dimensional numerical models, we explore first-order, bi-directional coupling between hydrological and mechanical processes. Our results suggest that: (i) most of the deformation occurs due to pore pressure changes following the start of geothermal production, (ii) the rate of deformation decays to zero over a time scale on the order of ~5 years as the system reaches steady state, and (iii) a reservoir-scale permeability of the order of ~1E–14 m<sup>2</sup> is required to explain the transient deformation.","Elsevier","","Univ. of Wisconsin, Madison, WI (United States)","USDOE Office of Energy Efficiency and Renewable Energy (EERE), Renewable Power Office.

The 1500 m (length) by 500 m (width) by 400 m (depth) volume of the laboratory overlies a geothermal reservoir. The surface Distributed Acoustic Sensing (DAS) array consisted of 8700 m of fiber-optic cable in a shallow trench, including 340 m in a well. The conventional seismometer array consisted of 238 three- component geophones. The DAS cable was laid out in three parallel zig-zag lines with line segments approximately 100 meters in length and geophones were spaced at approximately 60- meter intervals. Both DAS and conventional geophones recorded continuously over 15 days during which a moderate-sized earthquake with a local magnitude of 4.3 was recorded on March 21, 2016. Its epicenter was approximately 150-km south-southeast of the laboratory. Several DAS line segments with co-located geophone stations were used to compare signal-to-noise (SNR) ratios in both time and frequency domains and to test relationships between DAS and geophone data. The ratios were typically within a factor of five of each other with DAS SNR often greater for P-wave but smaller for S-wave relative to geophone SNR. The SNRs measured for an earthquake can be better than for active sources, because the earthquake signal contains more low frequency energy and the noise level is also lower at those lower frequencies. Amplitudes of the sum of several DAS strain-rate waveforms matched the finite difference of two geophone waveforms reasonably well, as did the amplitudes of DAS strain waveforms with particle-velocity waveforms recorded by geophones. Similar agreement was found between DAS and geophone observations and synthetic strain seismograms. In conclusion, the combination of good SNR in the seismic frequency band, high-spatial density, large N, and highly accurate time control among individual sensors suggests that DAS arrays have potential to assume a role in earthquake seismology.","Oxford University Press","External Audience (Unlimited)","Lawrence Livermore National Lab.

Adjustment of feed pH may reduce silica scaling risk, which is important for inland facilities that operate at high water recoveries to reduce brine disposal costs. However, water recovery of reverse osmosis is also limited due to increased osmotic pressure with feed water concentration. Membrane distillation (MD) is a thermally driven membrane desalination technique that is not limited by increased osmotic pressure of the feed. In this investigation, pH adjustment was tested as a strategy to reduce silica scaling risk in the MD process. With feed water pH less than 5 or higher than 10, scaling impacts were negligible at silica concentrations up to 600 mg/L. Scaling rates were highest at neutral pH between 6 and 8. Cleaning strategies were also explored to remove silica scale from membranes. Cleaning using NaOH solutions at pH higher than 11 to induce dissolution of silica scale was effective at temporarily restoring performance; however, some silica remained on membrane surfaces and scaling upon re-exposure to supersaturated silica concentrations occurred faster than with new membranes.","Elsevier","","National Renewable Energy Lab.

"A conceptual geochemical model of the geothermal system at Surprise Valley, CA","Fowler, Andrew P. G.; Ferguson, Colin; Cantwell, Carolyn A.; Zierenberg, Robert A.; McClain, James; Spycher, Nicolas; Dobson, Patrick","15 GEOTHERMAL ENERGY; Surprise valley; geothermal; geochemical modeling; optimized multicomponent geothermometry; rare earth elements; trace elements","Characterizing the geothermal system at Surprise Valley (SV), northeastern California, is important for determining the sustainability of the energy resource, and mitigating hazards associated with hydrothermal eruptions that last occurred in 1951. Previous geochemical studies of the area attempted to reconcile different hot spring compositions on the western and eastern sides of the valley using scenarios of dilution, equilibration at low temperatures, surface evaporation, and differences in rock type along flow paths. These models were primarily supported using classical geothermometry methods, and generally assumed that fluids in the Lake City mud volcano area on the western side of the valley best reflect the composition of a deep geothermal fluid. In this contribution, we address controls on hot spring compositions using a different suite of geochemical tools, including optimized multicomponent geochemistry (GeoT) models, hot spring fluid major and trace element measurements, mineralogical observations, and stable isotope measurements of hot spring fluids and precipitated carbonates. We synthesize the results into a conceptual geochemical model of the Surprise Valley geothermal system, and show that high-temperature (quartz, Na/K, Na/K/Ca) classical geothermometers fail to predict maximum subsurface temperatures because fluids re-equilibrated at progressively lower temperatures during outflow, including in the Lake City area. We propose a model where hot spring fluids originate as a mixture between a deep thermal brine and modern meteoric fluids, with a seasonally variable mixing ratio. The deep brine has deuterium values at least 3 to 4‰ lighter than any known groundwater or high-elevation snow previously measured in and adjacent to SV, suggesting it was recharged during the Pleistocene when meteoric fluids had lower deuterium values. The deuterium values and compositional characteristics of the deep brine have only been identified in thermal springs and groundwater samples collected in proximity to structures that transmit thermal fluids, suggesting the brine may be thermal in nature. On the western side of the valley at the Lake City mud volcano, the deep brine-meteoric water mixture subsequently boils in the shallow subsurface, precipitates calcite, and re-equilibrates at about 130 °C. On the eastern side of the valley, meteoric fluid mixes to a greater extent with the deep brine, cools conductively without boiling, and the composition is modified as dissolved elements are sequestered by secondary minerals that form along the cooling and outflow path at temperatures <130 °C. Re-equilibration of geothermal fluids at lower temperatures during outflow explains why subsurface temperature estimates based on classical geothermometry methods are highly variable, and fail to agree with temperature estimates based on dissolved sulfate-oxygen isotopes and results of classical and multicomponent geothermometry applied to reconstructed deep well fluids. Furthermore, the proposed model is compatible with the idea suggested by others that thermal fluids on the western and eastern side of the valley have a common source, and supports the hypothesis that low temperature re-equilibration during west to east flow is the major control on hot spring fluid compositions, rather than dilution, evaporation, or differences in rock type.","Elsevier","","Lawrence Berkeley National Lab.

"Monitoring reservoir response to earthquakes and fluid extraction, Salton Sea geothermal field, California","Taira, Taka’aki; Nayak, Avinash; Brenguier, Florent; Manga, Michael","58 GEOSCIENCES; 15 GEOTHERMAL ENERGY","Continuous monitoring of in situ reservoir responses to stress transients provides insights into the evolution of geothermal reservoirs. By exploiting the stress dependence of seismic velocity changes, we investigate the temporal evolution of the reservoir stress state of the Salton Sea geothermal field (SSGF), California. We find that the SSGF experienced a number of sudden velocity reductions (~0.035 to 0.25%) that are most likely caused by openings of fractures due to dynamic stress transients (as small as 0.08 MPa and up to 0.45 MPa) from local and regional earthquakes. Depths of velocity changes are estimated to be about 0.5 to 1.5 km, similar to the depths of the injection and production wells. We derive an empirical in situ stress sensitivity of seismic velocity changes by relating velocity changes to dynamic stresses. We also observe systematic velocity reductions (0.04 to 0.05%) during earthquake swarms in mid-November 2009 and late-December 2010. On the basis of volumetric static and dynamic stress changes, the expected velocity reductions from the largest earthquakes with magnitude ranging from 3 to 4 in these swarms are less than 0.02%, which suggests that these earthquakes are likely not responsible for the velocity changes observed during the swarms. Instead, we argue that velocity reductions may have been induced by poroelastic opening of fractures due to aseismic deformation. We also observe a long-term velocity increase (~0.04%/year) that is most likely due to poroelastic contraction caused by the geothermal production. Our observations demonstrate that seismic interferometry provides insights into in situ reservoir response to stress changes.","AAAS","","Lawrence Berkeley National Lab.

Two temperature logs run on the corehole display an obvious inflection point at about 960 m. Such behavior is indicative of downward fluid flow in the wellbore. The geothermal gradient above 935 m is 4.5 °C/km, while the gradient is 72–75 °C/km from 980 to 1440 m. Projecting the higher gradients upward to where they intersect the lower gradient on the temperature logs places the bottom of the cold, freshwater Snake River Plain aquifer, which suppresses the geothermal gradient at this location, at least 860 m below the surface. The average heat flow for the corehole between 983 and 1550 m is 132 mW/m<sup>2</sup>. Although the maximum bottom-hole temperature extrapolated from a measured time–temperature curve was only 59.3 °C, geothermometers suggest an equilibrium temperature on the order of 125–140 °C based on a single fluid sample from 1070 m. Furthermore, below 960 m the basalt core shows obvious signs of alteration, including a distinct color change, the formation of smectite clay, and the presence of secondary minerals filling vesicles and fracture zones.

For this study, temperature data was collected in an observation well at an active geothermal site for a period of eight days under geothermal production conditions. Collected temperature data showcase the ability of DTS systems to detect changes to the location of the steam-water interface, visualize borehole temperature recovery — following injection of a coldwater “slug” — and identify anomalously warm and/or cool zones. The high sampling rate and spatial resolution of DTS data also shows borehole temperature dynamics that are not captured by traditional pressure-temperature survey tools. Inversion of thermal recovery data using a finite-difference heat-transfer model produces a thermal-diffusivity profile that is consistent with laboratorymeasured values and correlates with identified lithologic changes within the borehole. Used alone or in conjunction with complementary data sets, DTS systems are useful tools for developing a better understanding of both reservoir rock thermal properties as well as within and near borehole fluid movement.","","","Univ. of Wisconsin, Madison, WI (United States)","USDOE Office of Energy Efficiency and Renewable Energy (EERE), Renewable Power Office.

"Exergy of air, CO<sub>2</sub>, and H<sub>2</sub>O for use as geothermal fluids","Phuoc, Tran X.; Massoudi, Mehrdad; Wang, Ping; McKoy, Mark L.","15 GEOTHERMAL ENERGY; Geothermal fluid; Carbon dioxide; Air; Water; Geothermal; Exergy","Geothermal energy refers to the thermal energy naturally stored in the hot rock formation buried deep beneath the Earth’s surface. To harvest this source of energy, a fluid is pumped down in a set of injection wells, circulates through the hot rock and then is collected via a set of production wells for heating or other purposes. Furthermore, the selection of this fluid is an important component of a geothermal system. In this work, we review, evaluate, and develop the fundamental equations that can reliably predict the thermodynamic and the transport properties of air, CO<sub>2</sub>, and H<sub>2</sub>O. Using these equations, we characterize and compare the heat extraction and exergy carried by these fluids as they circulate through a hot rock reservoir to determine which fluid offers better functionality for geothermal heat harvesting applications. The results indicate that, in terms of heat extraction and exergy, air is a better fluid compared to CO<sub>2</sub> and water.","Elsevier","","National Energy Technology Lab.

"A suite of benchmark and challenge problems for enhanced geothermal systems","White, Mark; Fu, Pengcheng; McClure, Mark; Danko, George; Elsworth, Derek; Sonnenthal, Eric; Kelkar, Sharad; Podgorney, Robert","15 GEOTHERMAL ENERGY","A diverse suite of numerical simulators is currently being applied to predict or understand the performance of enhanced geothermal systems (EGS). To build confidence and identify critical development needs for these analytical tools, the United States Department of Energy, Geothermal Technologies Office sponsored a Code Comparison Study (GTO-CCS), with participants from universities, industry, and national laboratories. A principal objective for the study was to create a community forum for improvement and verification of numerical simulators for EGS modeling. Teams participating in the study were those representing U.S. national laboratories, universities, and industries, and each team brought unique numerical simulation capabilities to bear on the problems. Two classes of problems were developed during the study, benchmark problems and challenge problems. The benchmark problems were structured to test the ability of the collection of numerical simulators to solve various combinations of coupled thermal, hydrologic, geomechanical, and geochemical processes. This class of problems was strictly defined in terms of properties, driving forces, initial conditions, and boundary conditions. The challenge problems were based on the enhanced geothermal systems research conducted at Fenton Hill, near Los Alamos, New Mexico, between 1974 and 1995. The problems involved two phases of research, stimulation, development, and circulation in two separate reservoirs. The challenge problems had specific questions to be answered via numerical simulation in three topical areas: (1) reservoir creation/stimulation, (2) reactive and passive transport, and (3) thermal recovery. Whereas the benchmark class of problems were designed to test capabilities for modeling coupled processes under strictly specified conditions, the stated objective for the challenge class of problems was to demonstrate what new understanding of the Fenton Hill experiments could be realized via the application of modern numerical simulation tools by recognized expert practitioners. Lastly, we present the suite of benchmark and challenge problems developed for the GTO-CCS, providing problem descriptions and sample solutions.","Springer","External Audience (Unlimited)","Lawrence Livermore National Lab.

"How to sustain a CO<sub>2</sub>-thermosiphon in a partially saturated geothermal reservoir: Lessons learned from field experiment and numerical modeling","Pan, Lehua; Doughty, Christine; Freifeld, Barry","15 GEOTHERMAL ENERGY; sustainability of CO2-Thermosiphon; partially saturated reservoir; field experiment; coupled wellbore-reservoir-surface devices simulation; T2Well","CO<sub>2</sub> has been proposed as a working fluid for geothermal energy production because of its ability to establish a self-sustaining CO<sub>2</sub> thermosiphon, taking advantage of the strong temperature dependence of CO<sub>2</sub> density. To test the concept of CO<sub>2</sub> heat extraction, in January 2015 a CO<sub>2</sub> thermosiphon was operated at the SECARB Cranfield Site, Cranfield, Mississippi, where a brine-saturated sand at a depth of 3.2 km has been under near continuous CO<sub>2</sub> flood since December 2009 as part of a U.S. Department of Energy demonstration of CO<sub>2</sub> sequestration, resulting in a partially saturated reservoir surrounding a well pair. The lateral distance between the producer and injector was 112 m at reservoir depth, a distance considered pre-commercial in scale, but great enough that thermal breakthrough was still not significant after several years of injection. Instead of producing power with a turbine, heat was extracted heat from recirculated fluid using a heat exchanger and portable chiller. The well field and surface equipment were instrumented to compare field observations with predicted responses from numerical models. Thermosiphon flow could be initiated by venting, but thereafter flow rate steadily declined, indicating that the thermosiphon was not sustainable. To model the system, the capability of T2Well, a fully coupled wellbore/reservoir numerical simulator, was expanded to enable simulation of the entire loop of fluid circulation in the fully-coupled system consisting of the injection/production wells, the reservoir, and the surface devices (heat exchanger, flow-rate regulator etc.). Combined with the newly developed TOUGH2 equation of state module called EOS7CMA, the enhanced T2 Well was used prior to the field experiment to simulate the circulation of a CO<sub>2</sub> -H<sub>2</sub>O-CH<sub>4</sub>mixture in a model geothermal system patterned after the Cranfield demonstration test. The model predicted that a sustainable thermosiphon could be achieved. After the field thermosiphon did not achieve the pre-test prediction of flow rates and thermosiphon sustainability, the numerical model was modified to improve realism and calibrate certain processes; it was then able to reproduce the major phenomena observed in the field. In a series of sensitivity studies, many factors were found that could potentially contribute to the failing of a sustainable thermosiphon. These factors could be categorized as two types: factors that increase the resistance to flow and factors that increase heat loss of the working fluid. In conclusion, the lessons learned can be applied to both future modeling and to achieving CO<sub>2</sub> -based geothermal reservoir exploitation.","Elsevier","","Lawrence Berkeley National Lab.

Geothermal brines are used to generate electricity, but often contain high concentrations of dissolved salt. Here in this paper, we demonstrate how the residual heat left in spent geothermal brines can be used to drive a membrane distillation (MD) process and recover desalinated water. Porous polypropylene membranes were coated with a carbon nanotube (CNT)/poly(vinyl alcohol) layer, resulting in composite membranes having a binary structure that combines the hydrophobic properties critical for MD with the hydrophilic and conductive properties of the CNTs. We demonstrate that the addition of the CNT layer increases membrane flux due to enhanced heat transport from the bulk feed to the membrane surface, a result of CNT's high thermal transport properties. Furthermore, we show how hydroxide ion generation, driven by water electrolysis on the electrically conducting membrane surface, can be used to efficiently dissolve silicate scaling that developed during the process of desalinating the geothermal brine, negating the need for chemical cleaning.","American Chemical Society (ACS)","","National Renewable Energy Lab.

A new concept, to use concentrated solar thermal energy first in a high pressure steam topping turbine, and then as an additional heat source to the Raft River geothermal binary power plant (GBPP) in Idaho, USA was investigated. The approach yielded an economically attractive design through lower capital cost, higher net output and higher efficiency. An unexpected result was the option to incorporate solar thermal storage into the hybrid cycle for 4 or 8 hours at a cost far below battery storage of electrical energy. U.S. Geothermal Inc.

"Anomalous aging of EPDM and FEPM under combined thermo-oxidative and hydrolytic conditions","Redline, Erica M.; Celina, Mathias C.; Harris, Charles E.; Giron, Nicholas H.; Sugama, Toshifumi; Pyatina, Tatiana","15 GEOTHERMAL ENERGY; 36 MATERIALS SCIENCE; polymer degradation; high temperature; Steam environment; mechanistic changes; anomalous aging","Previous observation of EPDM and FEPM materials aged in thermo-oxidative and thermo-oxidative plus hydrolytic environments revealed an unusual trend: the degradation and disintegration of these polymers in the former case but the ability to maintain mechanical performance and shape in the latter [1]. No abnormalities were observed in the chemical (oxidation rates, FTIR spectra, solvent uptake, gel content, and weight loss vs. temperature) or physical (modulus profile) measurements that could explain these empirically observed aging differences. A second controlled aging test was conducted to verify this trend using only EPDM. Once again it was shown that thermo-oxidative conditions appear to cause more degradative damage (enhanced embrittlement) than observed for the combined thermo-oxidative plus hydrolytic environments. From these data we conclude that water may favorably interfere with normal thermo-oxidative degradation processes. This interference may occur via some combination of chemical and physical property changes in the presence of steam such as: oxidation rate and O2 permeability changes, additional sensitivity to hydrolytic damage, and/or mechanistic changes in relation to pH and hydroperoxide formation.","Elsevier","","Brookhaven National Lab.

"Strain localization and elastic-plastic coupling during deformation of porous sandstone","Dewers, Thomas A.; Issen, Kathleen A.; Holcomb, David J.; Olsson, William A.; Ingraham, Mathew D.","15 GEOTHERMAL ENERGY; 36 MATERIALS SCIENCE; 42 ENGINEERING; localization theory; bifurcation; sandstone; experimental rock; mechanics","In this paper, results of axisymmetric compression tests on weak, porous Castlegate Sandstone (Cretaceous, Utah, USA), covering a range of dilational and compactional behaviors, are examined for localization behavior. Assuming isotropy, bulk and shear moduli evolve as increasing functions of mean stress and Mises equivalent shear stress respectively, and as decreasing functions of work-conjugate plastic strains. Acoustic emissions events located during testing show onset of localization and permit calculation of observed shear and low-angle compaction localization zones, or bands, as localization commences. Total strain measured experimentally partitions into: A) elastic strain with constant moduli, B) elastic strain due to stress dependence of moduli, C) elastic strain due to moduli degradation with increasing plastic strain, and D) plastic strain. The third term is the elastic-plastic coupling strain, and though often ignored, contributes significantly to pre-failure total strain for brittle and transitional tests. Constitutive parameters and localization predictions derived from experiments are compared to theoretical predictions. In the brittle regime, predictions of band angles (angle between band normal and maximum compression) demonstrate good agreement with observed shear band angles. Compaction localization was observed in the transitional regime in between shear localization and spatially pervasive compaction, over a small range of mean stresses. Finally, in contrast with predictions, detailed acoustic emissions analyses in this regime show low angle, compaction-dominated but shear-enhanced, localization.","Elsevier","","Sandia National Lab.

Upon loading, a zwitterionic structure forms with a small activation energy of ca 16 kJ/mol and a small stabilization of ca 6 kJ/mol. Viscosity increases exponentially with CO<sub>2</sub> loading due to hydrogen-bonding between neighboring Zwitterions. We find that molecular structures that promote internal hydrogen bonding (within the same molecule) and suppress interactions with neighboring molecules have low viscosities. In addition, tuning the acid/base properties leads to a shift of the equilibrium toward a non-charged (acid) form that further reduces the viscosity. Here, based on the above structural criteria, a reduced order model is also presented that allows for the quick screening of large compound libraries and down selection of promising candidates for synthesis and testing.","Elsevier","","Pacific Northwest National Lab.

This screening was intended to prioritize prospects that have a greater likelihood of proceeding through regulatory review to production in a timely and cost-effective manner. Development viability was determined to be high, medium, or low based on four factors: i) grid accessibility, ii) vulnerability to natural hazards, iii) current and probable future land uses; and iv) community sentiment and acceptance. Development viability was assessed in >10 areas of interest that were selected based on the results of the probability and confidence mapping, and was a guiding criterion used to develop a prioritized roadmap for the next phase of exploration activity in Hawaii.

"Numerical analysis of downhole heat exchanger designed for geothermal energy production","Akhmadullin, I.; Tyagi, M.","15 GEOTHERMAL ENERGY; Downhole heat exchanger; Low enthalpy geothermal reservoir; Horizontal well; Zero mass extraction method","A traditional way of geothermal energy production implies hot brine extraction from the reservoir to a surface facility. This method is economically profitable only for high enthalpy reservoirs associated with shallow depths and high temperatures. The low enthalpy geothermal (LEG) projects are out of consideration due to the high cost of produced electric power related to expensive drilling, cost of the binary cycle system, and long term installation cost. This paper presents a new zero mass extraction method utilizing downhole heat exchanger (DHE) with no geo-fluid production to the surface. The well design stays as a single horizontal well with coupled production and injection sections. The brine pump is located between the sections providing hot brine circulation through the DHE. The coupled fluid flow and heat transfer mathematical model was developed and simulated using nodal analysis method. The LEG reservoir prototype located in South Louisiana was used to study several cases of the DHE lengths, inclination angles, reservoir permeabilities, and flow rates optimization. According to the analysis, the power unit is able to provide 160 kW of net electric power with CO2 working fluid circulating inside a single lateral well. Increasing the reservoir temperature and the number of laterals, the available power production rises up to 600 kW with an attractive electricity cost of $21.84/MWh at 7000 m well depth. This methods opens a new prospective for the depleted petroleum wells converting them to the electricity production units.","Springer","","Louisiana State Univ., Baton Rouge, LA (United States)","USDOE","","United States","2017-07-29T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: Geothermal Energy; Journal Volume: 5; Journal Issue: 1","","Medium: ED; Size: 24 p.","","","EE0005125","Journal ID: ISSN 2195-9706","10.1186/s40517-017-0071-2","","2021-07-30T00:00:00Z","1511039","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/1511039","https://www.osti.gov/servlets/purl/1511039","Geothermal Energy","1","5"

Although the new instruments have battery life and bandwidth limitations compared to broadband instruments, the relatively low deployment and procurement cost of these new nodal geophones provides an additional novel tool for researchers. In this paper, we explore the viability of using autonomous three-component nodal geophones to calculate teleseismic Ps receiver functions by comparison of co-located broadband stations and highlight some potential advantages with a dense nodal array deployed around the Upper Geyser basin in Yellowstone National Park. Two key findings from this example include (1) very dense nodal arrays can be used to image small-scale features in the shallow crust that typical broadband station spacing would alias, and (2) nodal arrays with a larger footprint could be used to image deeper features with greater or equal detail as typical broadband deployments but at a reduced deployment cost.","Seismological Society of America","","Univ. of Utah, Salt Lake City, UT (United States)","USDOE Office of Energy Efficiency and Renewable Energy (EERE), Renewable Power Office.

"Muscovite dissolution kinetics as a function of pH at elevated temperature","Lammers, Kristin (ORCID:0000000185953342); Smith, Megan M.; Carroll, Susan A.","58 GEOSCIENCES; 15 GEOTHERMAL ENERGY; 37 INORGANIC, ORGANIC, PHYSICAL AND ANALYTICAL CHEMISTRY; Muscovite; Sheet silicate; Dissolution kinetics; Reaction affinity; Geothermal energy","We report that mineral reactivity can play an important role in fracture-controlled fluid networks where maintaining or increasing permeability is a goal, such as enhanced geothermal systems. In these systems, dissolution generates new void space, removes cement and physically transports less reactive mineral grains, while secondary precipitation acts to narrow or seal off fluid pathways. Sheet silicate mineral reactivity is likely to affect permeability evolution at the elevated temperatures of geothermal reservoirs because of the high reactive surface area and prevalence of these minerals in hydrothermal zones. To better describe the reactivity of one common sheet silicate, muscovite, we conducted kinetic dissolution experiments using flow-through reactors at temperatures of 100–280 °C and a pH range of 2–9. Surface area-normalized muscovite dissolution rates ranged from 0.17–155 · 10<sup>- 11</sup> mol m<sup>- 2</sup> s<sup>- 1</sup> over this temperature range, but showed little variation with pH above 150 °C. Aluminum was released to solution nonstoichiometrically with respect to dissolved silica, most likely resulting from secondary precipitation of an aluminum oxy-hydroxide identified as boehmite (γ-AlO(OH)(<sub>s</sub>)) by X-ray diffraction in reaction products from experiments conducted at pH ≤ 6. Surface area-normalized muscovite dissolution rates, Rate<sub>mus</sub> (mol m<sup>- 2</sup> s<sup>- 1</sup>), can be described from 25 to 280 °C with the following kinetic rate equation: Rate<sub>mus</sub> = ([3∙10<sup>-3</sup>∙e<sup>-44</sup><sup>/R∙T</sup>∙a$0.8\atop{H+}$] + [9∙10<sup>-6</sup>∙e-<sup>45/R∙T</sup>] + [5∙10<sup>-1</sup>∙<sup>e-61/R∙T</sup> ∙a$0.6\atop{OH-}$] ∙ (1-e<sup>-ΔG<sub>r</sub>/RT</sup>) where the rate and pre-exponential factors are in mol m<sup>- 2</sup> s<sup>- 1</sup>; the activation energies, E, are in kJ mol<sup>- 1</sup>; a<sub>H<sup>+</sup></sub> and a<sub>OH<sup>-</sup></sub> represent the activities of H<sup>+</sup> and OH<sup>-</sup>, respectively; R (kJ mol<sup>- 1</sup> K<sup>- 1</sup>) is the gas constant; T is the temperature in Kelvins; and ΔG<sub>r</sub> (kJ mol<sup>- 1</sup>) is a measure of how close the aqueous solution is to muscovite equilibrium. The rate equation is constrained by our new data literature rates and has been evaluated against previous formulations with varying dependence on reaction affinity. Although 150 °C muscovite rates from Oelkers et al. (2008) show a systematic dependence on reaction affinity, incorporating this dependence did not accurately reproduce the higher-temperature rates. In conclusion, we recommend the rate equation shown above, with an affinity term that slows reaction rates only when solutions are close to equilibrium, for simulating the dissolution of muscovite under geothermal conditions.","Elsevier","","Lawrence Livermore National Lab.

"An Experimental Investigation of Distributed Acoustic Sensing (DAS) on Lake Ice","Castongia, Ethan; Wang, Herb F.; Lord, Neal; Fratta, Dante; Mondanos, Michael; Chalari, Athena","15 GEOTHERMAL ENERGY","A vibration-sensitive, Distributed Acoustic Sensor (DAS) array, using fiber-optic cables, was deployed in a triangularly shaped geometry on the frozen surface of Lake Mendota in Madison, Wisconsin, USA. The purpose of the array and testing program was to analyze the DAS response and to utilize the high spatial density of the distributed array for system response characterization in a well-constrained, small, surface array. A geophone array was also deployed to provide a reference system. The design of the array allowed us to assess the response of DAS with respect to distance from the seismic sources, the degradation of the response with length of the cable, the directivity of the fiber response with respect of the direction of the particle motion, and the quality of the signal with respect to cable type. The DAS array was examined for different cable constructions and orientations relative to the source propagation direction. Tight-buffered and loose-tube fiber-optic cable constructions were used, with both having good signal responses when well-coupled to the ice. In general, the tight-buffered cable was better suited for DAS applications. Directional sensitivity of the DAS was also inspected for several directions of wave propagation and particle motion. The results showed that the strongest DAS signals were recorded when the direction of the fiber was oriented parallel to the direction of particle motion. Lastly, the DAS and geophone data sets were examined together to qualitatively determine, in conjunction with established DAS best practices, how the high spatial density offered by DAS could improve results over traditional point sensor arrays in certain situations.","Environmental and Engineering Geophysical Society","","Univ. of Wisconsin, Madison, WI (United States)","USDOE Office of Energy Efficiency and Renewable Energy (EERE), Renewable Power Office.

The recoveries of the samples depended on their modification with silica and the curing environment, but were more than 100% after repeated damage under some test conditions. The mechanical properties and phase compositions of recovered samples were evaluated by compressive strength measurements and x-ray diffraction, differential thermogravimetric analyses, Fourier transform infrared analyses and scanning electron microscopy coupled with energy dispersive x-ray spectroscopy. The sealing of 0·25 mm wide and ~2 mm deep cracks was visualised with a three-dimensional optical microscope. Fer decomposed under high-temperature alkaline conditions with the release of hydrolysates that, along with the hydrating clinker, participated in the formation of new phases contributing to strength recoveries. Here, these phases included crystalline magnesium and aluminium-containing silicates, calcium and carbonated calcium silicates and amorphous hydrates. Crack sealing was complete for the silica-modified samples and partial for unmodified ones cured in carbonate environments. The sealing was very poor for samples cured in water. Lastly, the main sealing phases included crystalline and amorphous silica, high-temperature-stable zeolites and talc mineral.","ICE Publishing","","Brookhaven National Lab.

"Play-fairway analysis for geothermal resources and exploration risk in the Modoc Plateau region","Siler, Drew L.; Zhang, Yingqi; Spycher, Nicolas F.; Dobson, Patrick F.; McClain, James S.; Gasperikova, Erika; Zierenberg, Robert A.; Schiffman, Peter; Ferguson, Colin; Fowler, Andrew; Cantwell, Carolyn","15 GEOTHERMAL ENERGY; geothermal exploration; play-fairway; fuzzy logic; faults; geothermometry","The region surrounding the Modoc Plateau, encompassing parts of northeastern California, southern Oregon, and northwestern Nevada, lies at an intersection between two tectonic provinces; the Basin and Range province and the Cascade volcanic arc. Both of these provinces have substantial geothermal resource base and resource potential. Geothermal systems with evidence of magmatic heat, associated with Cascade arc magmatism, typify the western side of the region. Systems on the eastern side of the region appear to be fault controlled with heat derived from high crustal heat flow, both of which are typical of the Basin and Range. As it has the potential to host Cascade arc-type geothermal resources, Basin and Range-type geothermal resources, and/or resources with characteristics of both provinces, and because there is relatively little current development, the Modoc Plateau region represents an intriguing potential for undiscovered geothermal resources. It remains unclear however, what specific set(s) of characteristics are diagnostic of Modoc-type geothermal systems and how or if those characteristics are distinct from Basin and Range-type or Cascade arc-type geothermal systems. In order to evaluate the potential for undiscovered geothermal resources in the Modoc area, we integrate a wide variety of existing data in order to evaluate geothermal resource potential and exploration risk utilizing ‘play-fairway’ analysis. Here, we consider that the requisite parameters for hydrothermal circulation are: 1) heat that is sufficient to drive circulation, and 2) permeability that is sufficient to allow for fluid circulation in the subsurface. We synthesize data that indicate the extent and distribution of these parameters throughout the Modoc region. ‘Fuzzy logic’ is used to incorporate expert opinion into the utility of each dataset as an indicator of either heat or permeability, and thus geothermal favorability. The results identify several geothermal prospects, areas that are highly favorable for the occurrence of both heat and permeability. These are also areas where there is sufficient data coverage, quality, and consistency that the exploration risk is relatively low. These unknown, undeveloped, and under-developed prospects are well-suited for continued exploration efforts. The results also indicate to what degree the two ‘play-types,’ i.e. Cascade arc-type or Basin and Range-type, apply to each of the geothermal prospects, a useful guide in exploration efforts.","Elsevier","","Lawrence Berkeley National Lab.

Compressive strength recoveries and cracks sealing were examined to evaluate self-healing of the cement after repeated crush tests followed by two consecutive healing periods of 10 and 5 days at 270°C. Optical and scanning electron microscopes, X-ray diffraction, Fourier Transform infrared and EDX measurements along with thermal gravimetric analyses were used to identify phases participating in the healing processes. Samples with 1% mass fraction of TA by weight of blend demonstrated improved strength recoveries and crack plugging properties, especially in alkali carbonate environment. This effect was attributed to silicon-rich (C,N)-A-S-H amorphous phase predominant in TA-modified samples, high-temperature stable zeolite phases along with the formation of tobermorite-type crystals in the presence of tartaric acid.","MDPI","","Brookhaven National Lab.

"Geodetic imaging of thermal deformation in geothermal reservoirs - production, depletion and fault reactivation","Im, Kyungjae; Elsworth, Derek; Guglielmi, Yves; Mattioli, Glen S.","15 GEOTHERMAL ENERGY; geothermal; surface deformation; induced microearthquakes; geodesy; permeability","Here, we investigate thermally induced surface deformation in geothermal systems. To define source mechanisms at depth, we assess the mechanical process of subsurface deformation by assuming a spherically cooled fractured reservoir in an infinite medium and derive relations that define magnitudes of thermal contraction, stress change and permeability evolution. The magnitude of thermal deformation in typical geothermal system is larger than anticipated and suggests two different modalities of surface subsidence – thermal contraction and fault reactivation. Here, surface deformation (vertical displacement, surface tilt and horizontal strain) induced by the two different modalities are assessed with Mogi (contraction) and Okada (slip) models and compared with instrumental sensitivity of high precision surface geodetic tools. Here, we show that 1 year of geothermal operation at 10 MW with a power plant conversion efficiency of 12% can yield ~ 3.0 × 10<sup>4</sup> m<sup>3</sup> of subsurface volume change. For a reservoir at 2000 m depth, this induces ~ 1.7 mm of vertical surface displacement, ~ 800 nano-radians of surface tilt and ~ 900 nano-strains of surface strain. This result implies that typically observed magnitudes of surface subsidence (order of cm/year) are naturally expected in massive (100 MW scale) geothermal operations and observed surface subsidence may largely be the result of thermal contraction. Conversely, thermal unloading can trigger fault reactivation. Analysis with an Okada slip model shows these shear offsets on pre-existing faults can also result in surface deformations of considerable magnitude. Our analysis of field operational data from various geothermal projects suggests that both thermal contraction and slow fault reactivation may contribute to the observed large surface deformation. Comparison of predicted deformation with instrumental sensitivity of high precision surface tools confirms that geodetic signals, especially tilt and strain, are indeed sufficiently large to describe reservoir evolution and to potentially deconvolve reservoir parameters of interest, such as permeability.","Elsevier","","Lawrence Berkeley National Lab.

"Identification of blind geothermal resources in Surprise Valley, CA, using publicly available groundwater well water quality data","Fowler, Andrew P. G.; Spycher, Nicolas; Zierenberg, Robert A.; Cantwell, Carolyn A.","15 GEOTHERMAL ENERGY; 58 GEOSCIENCES; Surprise Valley; geothermal; evaporation; geochemical modeling; fluid mixing; blind geothermal resources","Geothermal resource exploration is generally limited to areas with surface expressions of thermal activity (fumaroles and hot springs), or relies on expensive geophysical exploration techniques. The hidden subsurface distribution of geothermal fluids has been identified using a free and publicly available water quality dataset from agricultural and domestic water wells in Surprise Valley, northeastern California. Thermally evolved waters in Surprise Valley have element ratios that vary in response to Ca carbonate and Mg silicate mineral precipitation, and have elevated total dissolved solids (TDS). The arid climate in Surprise Valley leads to surface water evaporation in a closed basin, producing high TDS Na-Cl-CO<sub>3</sub>-SO<sub>4</sub> brines in three ephemeral alkali lakes and in shallow groundwater under elevated soil CO<sub>2</sub> conditions. Evaporated fluids in Surprise Valley follow a chemical divide that leads to Ca carbonate and Mg silicate mineral precipitation. Plots of dissolved element ratios can be used to distinguish groundwater affected by evaporation from water affected by thermal water-rock interaction, however it is challenging to select components for plotting that best illustrate different fluid evolution mechanisms. Here, we use a principal component analysis of centered log-ratio transformed data, coupled with geochemical models of fluid evaporation and thermal mixing pathways, to identify components to plot that distinguish between groundwater samples influenced by evaporation from those influenced by thermal processes. We find that groundwater samples with a thermal signature come from wells that define a coherent, linear geographical distribution that closely matches the location of known and inferred faults. Finally, modification of the general approach employed here provides promise for identifying blind geothermal resources in other locations, by applying low-cost geochemical modeling and statistical techniques to areas where large groundwater quality geochemical datasets are available.","Elsevier","","Lawrence Berkeley National Lab.

"Play fairway analysis of geothermal resources across the State of Hawaii: 1.

The final products of this work include a statewide geothermal resource probability map, a map of confidence in this probability, an assessment of the viability of development in areas of interest, and a prioritized list of recommended future exploration activities. The intersection of subsurface heat (H), permeability (P), and fluid (F) is necessary for an optimum geothermal play. This study: (1) identified and compiled all legacy and current data relevant to Hawaii’s geothermal resource; (2) ranked these datasets in terms of their relevance to subsurface H, P, F; (3) developed a Bayesian statistical method to incorporate the data and their rankings, and produce a statewide resource probability map; (4) developed a method to assess confidence in the probability values; and (5) assessed what we term ‘development viability’ in resulting areas of interest across the state. This paper details the basic project workflow, and activities (1) and (2). It describes the rationale for including this study’s datasets: surface geologic mapping data (calderas, rift zones, volcanic vents, dikes, faults), groundwater data (temperature, Chloride:Magnesium, SiO<sub>2</sub>) and geophysical data (gravity, magnetotelluric, seismic, geodetic strain), and justifies their relative rankings in terms of H, P, and F. A second paper describes activities (3) and (4) related to the statistical methodology, and a third paper describes activity (5), the development viability criteria, as well as our suggested roadmap for future exploration activities. Overall, we find that the likelihood of abundant of geothermal resources is highest on the youngest island of Hawaii, but groundwater indicators suggest there may also be resources on the other, older islands. Furthermore, the higher demand for renewable energy on the more populated islands of Maui and Oahu, as well as a high viability of development on Lanai, also motivate further exploration on these islands.","Elsevier","","Univ. of Hawaii at Manoa, Honolulu, HI (United States)","USDOE Office of Energy Efficiency and Renewable Energy (EERE), Renewable Power Office.

The MH-2 drillhole targeted fractured crystalline and hydrothermally altered basalt in the area of the Mountain Home Air Force Base (Idaho) to a total depth of 1821 m. At 1745 m depth the drillhole encountered flowing artesian hydrothermal fluids of at least 150 °C. We integrate geological analyses of core, image log, and borehole geophysical data, and in situ stress analyses to describe the structural environment that produces permeability for artesian flow. The rocks in the lower 540 m of the drillhole consist of basalt flows as much as 30 m thick, altered basalt, and thin sedimentary horizons. The mechanical stratigraphy is defined by nine mechanical horizons that are in three ranges of rock strength on the basis of experimentally determined strength data, core logging, and geophysical log signatures. Hydrothermal alteration products and mineralization in the core are associated with three highly faulted sections; the lowermost section is associated with the zone of flowing thermal water. Shear slip indicators on faults observed in core indicate slip ranging from pure strike slip to normal failure mechanisms in the stronger horizons. The borehole breakouts indicate that the maximum horizontal stress, SH, is oriented 047° ± 7°, and drilling-induced tensile fractures indicate that SH is oriented at 67° ± 21°. The in situ stress orientations exhibit little variation over the depth of the measured interval, but the SH magnitude varies with depth, and is best explained by an oblique normal fault stress regime. The geomechanical model indicates that if pore pressures at depth are elevated above the normal hydrostatic gradient, as observed here, the system has the potential to deform by mixed normal and strike-slip failure. Our observations and interpretations suggest that the MH-2 borehole was drilled into oblique normal faults that intersect a buried 300°-trending fault block masked by the basaltic volcanic complex. These data indicate that the transition from the central to western Snake River Plain is characterized by complex structures developed in response to a transitional stress state related to Snake River Plain and western Basin and Range stress regimes. Furthermore, the western Basin and Range stress and tectonic regime may extend from northern Nevada into western Idaho and may enhance the potential for geothermal resources by creating interconnected fracture and fault-related permeability at depth.","Geological Society of America","","Utah State Univ., Logan, UT (United States)","USDOE Office of Energy Efficiency and Renewable Energy (EERE)","","United States","2017-06-01T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: Lithosphere; Journal Volume: 9; Journal Issue: 3","","Medium: ED; Size: p. 476-498","","","EE0002848; EE0006733","Journal ID: ISSN 1941-8264","10.1130/l609.1","","2021-11-24T00:00:00Z","1829494","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/1829494","https://www.osti.gov/servlets/purl/1829494","Lithosphere","3","9"

The work presented her focuses on bridging these knowledge gaps. Because the majority of water-lean solvents are still at the lab scale, substantial studies are still needed to model their performance at scale. This presents a significant challenge as eachformulation has different physical and thermodynamic properties and behavior, and quantifying how these different properties manifest themselves in conventional absorber-stripper configurations, or identifying new configurations that are specific for a solvent’s signature behavior. We identify critical areas of study that are needed, and our efforts (e.g. custom infrastructure, molecular models) to predict, measure, and model these behaviors. Such findings are critical for determining the rheology required for heat exchanger design; absorber designs and packing to accommodate solvents with gradient changes (e.g. viscosity, contact angle, surface tension), and stripper configurations without direct steam utilization or water reflux. Another critical area of research need is to understand the molecular structure of the liquid interface and bulk as a function of CO<sub>2</sub> loading, and to assess whether conventional film theories accurately quantify solvent behavior, or if thermodynamic models adequately quantify activity coefficients of ions in solution. We conclude with an assessment of our efforts to aid in bridging the knowledge gaps in understanding water-lean solvents, and suggestions of what is needed to enable large-scale demonstrations to meet the United States Department of Energy’s year 2030 goal.","Elsevier","","Pacific Northwest National Lab.

The application is to the State of Hawaii, and the data sets include the locations and ages of mapped volcanic centers, gravity and magnetotelluric measurements, groundwater temperature and geochemistry, ground surface deformation, seismicity, water table elevation, and groundwater recharge. Using the basic principles of Bayesian statistics, these data and expert knowledge about the effects and importance of the data are used to compute the probabilities of the primary resource qualities of elevated subsurface heat, reservoir permeability, and reservoir fluid content. The product of these marginal probabilities estimates the joint probability of all three qualities and hence the probability of a successful geothermal prospect at each map point. An analogous set of algorithms is used to quantify the confidence in the probability at each point. Not surprisingly, we find that successful geothermal prospects are most probable on the active volcanoes of Hawaii Island, including the area of Hawaii’s single geothermal energy plant. Probability decreases primarily with shield volcano age, being relatively moderate in select locations on Maui and Lanai, relatively low on Oahu, and minimal on Kauai. Future exploration efforts should consider these results as well as the practical, societal, and economic conditions that influence development viability. Here, the difficulties of interisland power transmission mean that even areas with moderate to low probabilities are worth investigating on islands with population centers.","Elsevier","","Univ. of Hawaii at Manoa, Honolulu, HI (United States)","USDOE Office of Energy Efficiency and Renewable Energy (EERE), Renewable Power Office.

Results show reservoir temperatures calculated using the quartz geothermometer are closest to those estimated with the IMG method. The concentrations of Al and Mg, as well as selected minerals for geothermometry computations, are key factors for successfully using the IMG. Using the IMG method together with classical geothermometers can significantly increase confidence in reservoir temperature estimations.

"Bond Durability of Carbon-Microfiber-Reinforced Alkali-Activated High-Temperature Cement Adhering to Carbon Steel","Sugama, Toshifumi; Pyatina, Tatiana","15 GEOTHERMAL ENERGY; Carbon Microfibers; Calcium Aluminate Cement; Fly Ash; Thermal Shock","The study aims at evaluating the bond durability of a carbon microfiber (CMF)-reinforced alkali-activating calcium aluminate cement (CAC)/fly ash F (FAF) blend cementitious material adhering to carbon steel (CS) under stresses induced by a 350°C heat-25°C water cooling cycle. This cementitious material/CS joint sample was originally prepared in an autoclave at 300°C under a pressure of 8.3 MPa. For comparison, two reference geothermal well cements, Class G modified with silica (G) and calciumaluminum phosphate (CaP), were employed as well reinforced with CMF. In the CAC/FAF blending cement systems, the CAC-derived cementitious reaction products preferentially adhered to CS surfaces, rather than that of FAF-related reaction products. CMF played a pivotal role in creating tough interfacial bond structure of cement layer adhering to CS. The bond toughness also was supported by the crystalline cementitious reaction products including sodalite, brownmillerite, and hedenbergite as major phases, and aragonite, boehmite, and garronite as minor ones. The brownmillerite as an interfacial reaction product between cement and CS promoted the chemical bonding of the cement to CS, while the other phases served in providing the attractive bonding of the cement to CS. The post-stress-test joint samples revealed the formation of additional brown-millerite, aragonite, and garronite, in particular brownmillerite as the major one. The combination of chemical bonding and self-advancing adherence behavior of the cement was essential for creating a better interfacial bond structure. A similar interfacial bond structure was observed with CaP. The crystalline phase composition of the autoclaved cement revealed apatite, zeolite, and ferrowyllieite as major reaction products, and aragonite and al-katoite as the minor ones. Ferrowyllieite was identified as cement/CS interfacial reaction product contributing to the chemical bond of cement, while the other phases aided in providing the attractive bond of cement. After a stress test, two phases, ferrowyllieite and aragonite, promoted the self-advancing adherence of cement to CS. However, the effectiveness of these phases in improving adherence performance of cement was less than that of CAC/FAF blend cement, reflecting the fact that the bond durability of CAC/FAF blend cement was far better than that of the CaP. In contrast, the autoclaved silica-modified G cement consisting of xonotlite, and 0.9 nm-to-bermorite and riversideite, with calcite as the crystalline reaction products, had no significant effect on improving the shear bond strength and the bond’s toughness. No interaction product with CS was found in the cement adhering to CS. After a stress test, the calcite phase acted only to promote the self-advancing adherence of cement, but its extent was minimal compared with that of the other cements, thereby resulting in poor bond durability.","Scientific Research Publishing Inc.

C.","15 GEOTHERMAL ENERGY; 58 GEOSCIENCES; Proppant transport; Particle settling; Microcapsules; Hydraulic fracture","In this study, proppant is a vital component of hydraulic stimulation operations, improving conductivity by maintaining fracture aperture. While correct placement is a necessary part of ensuring that proppant performs efficiently, the transport behavior of proppant in natural rock fractures is poorly understood. In particular, as companies pursue new propping strategies involving new types of proppant, more accurate models of proppant behavior are needed to help guide their deployment. A major difficulty with simulating reservoir-scale proppant behavior is that continuum models traditionally used to represent large-scale slurry behavior loose applicability in fracture geometries. Particle transport models are often based on representative volumes that are at the same scale or larger than fractures found in hydraulic fracturing operations, making them inappropriate for modeling these types of flows. In the absence of a first-principles approach, empirical closure relations are needed. However, even such empirical closure relationships are difficult to derive without an accurate understanding of proppant behavior on the particle level. Thus, there is a need for experiments and simulations capable of probing phenomena at the sub-fracture scale. In this paper, we present results from experimental and numerical studies investigating proppant behavior at the sub-fracture level, in particular, the role of particle dispersion during proppant settling. In the experimental study, three-dimensional printing techniques are used to accurately reproduce the topology of a fractured Marcellus shale sample inside a particle-flow cell.","Springer","","Lawrence Livermore National Lab.

"Inversion of geothermal heat flux in a thermomechanically coupled nonlinear Stokes ice sheet model","Zhu, Hongyu; Petra, Noemi; Stadler, Georg; Isaac, Tobin; Hughes, Thomas J. R.; Ghattas, Omar","15 GEOTHERMAL ENERGY","We address the inverse problem of inferring the basal geothermal heat flux from surface velocity observations using a steady-state thermomechanically coupled nonlinear Stokes ice flow model. This is a challenging inverse problem since the map from basal heat flux to surface velocity observables is indirect: the heat flux is a boundary condition for the thermal advection&ndash;diffusion equation, which couples to the nonlinear Stokes ice flow equations; together they determine the surface ice flow velocity. This multiphysics inverse problem is formulated as a nonlinear least-squares optimization problem with a cost functional that includes the data misfit between surface velocity observations and model predictions. A Tikhonov regularization term is added to render the problem well posed. We derive adjoint-based gradient and Hessian expressions for the resulting partial differential equation (PDE)-constrained optimization problem and propose an inexact Newton method for its solution. As a consequence of the Petrov&ndash;Galerkin discretization of the energy equation, we show that discretization and differentiation do not commute; that is, the order in which we discretize the cost functional and differentiate it affects the correctness of the gradient. Using two- and three-dimensional model problems, we study the prospects for and limitations of the inference of the geothermal heat flux field from surface velocity observations. The results show that the reconstruction improves as the noise level in the observations decreases and that short-wavelength variations in the geothermal heat flux are difficult to recover. We analyze the ill-posedness of the inverse problem as a function of the number of observations by examining the spectrum of the Hessian of the cost functional. Motivated by the popularity of operator-split or staggered solvers for forward multiphysics problems &ndash; i.e., those that drop two-way coupling terms to yield a one-way coupled forward Jacobian &ndash; we study the effect on the inversion of a one-way coupling of the adjoint energy and Stokes equations. Here, we show that taking such a one-way coupled approach for the adjoint equations can lead to an incorrect gradient and premature termination of optimization iterations. This is due to loss of a descent direction stemming from inconsistency of the gradient with the contours of the cost functional. Nevertheless, one may still obtain a reasonable approximate inverse solution particularly if important features of the reconstructed solution emerge early in optimization iterations, before the premature termination.","European Geosciences Union","","Univ. of Texas, Austin, TX (United States)","USDOE Office of Science (SC), Advanced Scientific Computing Research (ASCR)","","United States","2016-07-13T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: The Cryosphere (Online); Journal Volume: 10; Journal Issue: 4","","Medium: ED; Size: p. 1477-1494","","","SC0002710; SC0009286","Journal ID: ISSN 1994-0424","10.5194/tc-10-1477-2016","","2021-07-26T00:00:00Z","1435724","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/1435724","https://www.osti.gov/servlets/purl/1435724","The Cryosphere (Online)","4","10"

Formation occurs in two steps. Hot water circulates in the subsurface and dissolves silica from the host rock, usually rhyolites. Silica then precipitates after hot water is discharged and cools. Extensive sinter formations are linked to up-flow areas of fluids originating from high temperature (> 175 °C) deep reservoirs. Fluid geochemistry, microbial communities, and environmental conditions of deposition determine the texture of sinter and pore framework. Porosity strongly influences physical and hydraulic properties of rocks. To better understand the properties controlling the transport of fluids, and interpret geophysical observations in geothermal systems, here we studied 17 samples of modern geyserite sinter deposits (< 10 ka) from the active El Tatio geothermal field in northern Chile. We measured the physical properties (hydraulic, seismic, and electrical), and internal microstructure (using μX-Ray computed tomography). We find that the pore structure, and thus hydraulic and physical properties, is controlled by the distribution of microbial matter. Based on velocity-porosity relationships, permeability-porosity scaling, and image analysis of the 3D pore structure; we find that the physical and hydraulic properties of sinter more closely resemble those of vesicular volcanic rocks and other material formed by precipitation in geothermal settings (i.e., travertine) than clastic sedimentary rocks.","Elsevier","","Lawrence Berkeley National Lab.

A method for handling linearly dependent flow directions is described. A residual that can be used in a line search is defined. An algorithm that has been implemented and comprehensively tested is discussed in detail. Examples are presented to illustrate the computational cost of various components of the algorithm. The overall result is that a single Newton-Raphson iteration of the algorithm costs between 1.5 and 2 times that of an elastic calculation. Examples also illustrate the successful convergence of the algorithm in complicated situations. For example, without using the new contributions presented here, the algorithm fails to converge for approximately 50% of the trial stresses for a common geomechanical model of sedementary rocks, while the current algorithm results in complete success. Since it involves no approximations, the algorithm is used to quantify the accuracy of an efficient, pragmatic, but approximate, algorithm used for sedimentary-rock plasticity in a commercial software package. Furthermore, the main weakness of the algorithm is identified as the difficulty of correctly choosing the set of initially active constraints in the general setting.","Wiley","","Idaho National Lab.

"Effect of Tartaric Acid on Hydration of a Sodium-Metasilicate-Activated Blend of Calcium Aluminate Cement and Fly Ash F","Pyatina, Tatiana; Sugama, Toshifumi; Moon, Juhyuk; James, Simon","15 GEOTHERMAL ENERGY","An alkali-activated blend of aluminum cement and class F fly ash is an attractive solution for geothermal wells where cement is exposed to significant thermal shocks and aggressive environments. Set-control additives enable the safe cement placement in a well but may compromise its mechanical properties. Here, this work evaluates the effect of a tartaric-acid set retarder on phase composition, microstructure, and strength development of a sodium-metasilicate-activated calcium aluminate/fly ash class F blend after curing at 85 °C, 200 °C or 300 °C. The hardened materials were characterized with X-ray diffraction, thermogravimetric analysis, X-ray computed tomography, and combined scanning electron microscopy/energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy and tested for mechanical strength. With increasing temperature, a higher number of phase transitions in non-retarded specimens was found as a result of fast cement hydration. The differences in the phase compositions were also attributed to tartaric acid interactions with metal ions released by the blend in retarded samples. The retarded samples showed higher total porosity but reduced percentage of large pores (above 500 µm) and greater compressive strength after 300 °C curing. Lastly, mechanical properties of the set cements were not compromised by the retarder.","MDPI","","Brookhaven National Lab.

"Multifluid geo-energy systems: Using geologic CO<sub>2</sub> storage for geothermal energy production and grid-scale energy storage in sedimentary basins","Buscheck, Thomas A.; Bielicki, Jeffrey M.; Edmunds, Thomas A.; Hao, Yue; Sun, Yunwei; Randolph, Jimmy B.; Saar, Martin O.","15 GEOTHERMAL ENERGY; 25 ENERGY STORAGE","We present an approach that uses the huge fluid and thermal storage capacity of the subsurface, together with geologic carbon dioxide (CO<sub>2</sub>) storage, to harvest, store, and dispatch energy from subsurface (geothermal) and surface (solar, nuclear, fossil) thermal resources, as well as excess energy on electric grids. Captured CO<sub>2</sub> is injected into saline aquifers to store pressure, generate artesian flow of brine, and provide a supplemental working fluid for efficient heat extraction and power conversion. Concentric rings of injection and production wells create a hydraulic mound to store pressure, CO<sub>2</sub>, and thermal energy. This energy storage can take excess power from the grid and excess/waste thermal energy, and dispatch that energy when it is demanded and thus enable higher penetration of variable renewable energy technologies (e.g., wind, solar). CO<sub>2</sub> stored in the subsurface functions as a cushion gas to provide enormous pressure-storage capacity and displace large quantities of brine, some of which can be treated for a variety of beneficial uses. Geothermal power and energy-storage applications may generate enough revenues to compensate for CO<sub>2</sub> capture costs. While our approach can use nitrogen (N<sub>2</sub>), in addition to CO<sub>2</sub>, as a supplemental fluid, and store thermal energy, this study focuses using CO<sub>2</sub> for geothermal energy production and grid-scale energy storage. We conduct a techno-economic assessment to determine the levelized cost of electricity of using this approach to generate geothermal power. We present a reservoir pressure-management strategy that diverts a small portion of the produced brine for beneficial consumptive use to reduce the pumping cost of fluid recirculation, while reducing the risk of seismicity, caprock fracture, and CO<sub>2</sub> leakage.","Geological Society of America","","Lawrence Livermore National Lab.

Our Phase 1 PFAs predicted several plays throughout the study area, with a range of certainty and risk, based upon legacy data. In Phase 2, new data were collected for high priority plays and integrated into the PFAs to enhance certainty and further reduce risk. Field geology, gravity surveys and alluvial fan geomorphology supplemented the understanding of geologic structure and potential permeability, while additional well sampling, geothermometry and temperature logging provided valuable information about heat in the subsurface. In order to statistically compare and contrast the layers of evidence in the Tularosa Basin with the broader Great Basin, a probabilistic Weights of Evidence analysis was conducted in parallel with the inclusive and deterministic petroleum industry logic PFA.

"Thermal drawdown-induced flow channeling in a single fracture in EGS","Guo, Bin; Fu, Pengcheng; Hao, Yue; Peters, Catherine A.; Carrigan, Charles R.","15 GEOTHERMAL ENERGY; EGS; Thermal drawdown; Flow channeling; Aperture heterogeneity; THM coupling; GEOS","Here, the evolution of flow pattern along a single fracture and its effects on heat production is a fundamental problem in the assessments of engineered geothermal systems (EGS). The channelized flow pattern associated with ubiquitous heterogeneity in fracture aperture distribution causes non-uniform temperature decrease in the rock body, which makes the flow increasingly concentrated into some preferential paths through the action of thermal stress. This mechanism may cause rapid heat production deterioration of EGS reservoirs. In this study, we investigated the effects of aperture heterogeneity on flow pattern evolution in a single fracture in a low-permeability crystalline formation. We developed a numerical model on the platform of GEOS to simulate the coupled thermo-hydro-mechanical processes in a penny-shaped fracture accessed via an injection well and a production well. We find that aperture heterogeneity generally exacerbates flow channeling and reservoir performance generally decreases with longer correlation length of aperture field. The expected production life is highly variable (5 years to beyond 30 years) when the aperture correlation length is longer than 1/5 of the well distance, whereas a heterogeneous fracture behaves similar to a homogeneous one when the correlation length is much shorter than the well distance. Besides, the mean production life decreases with greater aperture standard deviation only when the correlation length is relatively long. Although flow channeling is inevitable, initial aperture fields and well locations that enable tortuous preferential paths tend to deliver long heat production lives.","Elsevier","","Lawrence Livermore National Lab.

Positive vertical deformation (2–5 mm/yr) was recorded in the middle of the Dachnyi Area in 2005–2006, giving way to a later stabilization. The North Test Area where the exhaust heat carrier was reinjected did not show any substantial deformation during the 2003–2006 period. This was followed by an uplift in 2006–2008 (6–7 mm/yr) and then by a subsidence (5–8 mm/yr) in 2009–2013. No vertical deformation worth mentioning was recorded in the Verkhne-Mutnovskii Area prior to 2008, but a rapid subsidence began at a rate of 6–18 mm/yr after 2008. Here, we used the TOUGH-FLAC software to analyze vertical ground deformation. This program is used to perform thermo-hydrogeomechanical (THM) modeling based on the previous TOUGH2 model. THM modeling can explain relative vertical deformation during the exploitation of the Mutnovskii Geothermal Field by separating the geothermal field into two compartments by the Osnovnoi fault, as the two have different tectonic settings and petrophysical properties.","","","Lawrence Berkeley National Lab.

The long axis of the ~4 km by ~1.5 km elliptical subsiding area coincides with the strike of the dominant normal fault system at Brady. Within this bowl of subsidence, the interference pattern shows several smaller features with length scales of the order of ~1 km. This signature occurs consistently in all of the well-correlated interferometric pairs spanning several months. Results from inverse modeling suggest that the deformation is a result of volumetric contraction in shallow units, no deeper than 600 m, likely associated with damaged regions where fault segments mechanically interact. Such damaged zones are expected to extend downward along steeply dipping fault planes, providing a high permeability conduit to the production wells. Using time series analysis, we test the hypothesis that geothermal production drives the observed deformation. We find a good correlation between the observed deformation rate and the rate of production in the shallow wells. We also explore mechanisms that could potentially cause the observed deformation, including thermal contraction of rock, decline in pore pressure and dissolution of minerals over time.","Elsevier","","Lawrence Berkeley National Lab.

If this ET did not occur temperatures would be higher, so understanding ET trends is crucial to predict future temperatures. Recent studies have reported prolonged declines in ET in recent decades, although these declines may relate to climate variability. Here, we used a well-validated diagnostic model to estimate daily ET during 1981–2012, and its three components: transpiration from vegetation (E<sub>t</sub>), direct evaporation from the soil (E<sub>s</sub>) and vaporization of intercepted rainfall from vegetation (E<sub>i</sub>). During this period, ET over land has increased significantly (p < 0.01), caused by increases in E<sub>t</sub> and E<sub>i</sub>, which are partially counteracted by E<sub>s</sub> decreasing. These contrasting trends are primarily driven by increases in vegetation leaf area index, dominated by greening. The overall increase in E<sub>t</sub> over land is about twofold of the decrease in E<sub>s</sub>. These opposing trends are not simulated by most Coupled Model Intercomparison Project phase 5 (CMIP5) models, and highlight the importance of realistically representing vegetation changes in earth system models for predicting future changes in the energy and water cycle.","Nature Publishing Group","","Princeton Univ., NJ (United States)","USDOE Office of Science (SC), Biological and Environmental Research (BER)","","United States","2016-01-11T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: Scientific Reports; Journal Volume: 6","","Medium: ED; Size: Article No. 19124","","","FG02-04ER63917","Journal ID: ISSN 2045-2322; srep19124","10.1038/srep19124","","2022-05-23T00:00:00Z","1238787","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/1238787","https://www.osti.gov/servlets/purl/1238787","Scientific Reports","","6"

"The effect of spatial aperture variations on the thermal performance of discretely fractured geothermal reservoirs","Fox, Don Bruce; Koch, Donald Lyle; Tester, Jefferson William","15 GEOTHERMAL ENERGY; Enhanced geothermal systems; Aperture variations; Roughness; Discrete fractures; Heat transport in fractures; Coupled convective conductive heat transport; Thermal hydraulic modeling; Geothermal reservoir performance modeling","The effect of spatial aperture variations on the thermal performance of discretely fractured geothermal reservoirs was investigated using finite element method solutions to the convective heat transfer in the fracture coupled with a boundary integral description of conductive heat transfer in the rock. The dipolar flow was generated by a source of fluid volume at an injection well and a sink at a production well within a circular fracture. The statistics of the thermal performance of an ensemble of fracture realizations was evaluated. Fractures with self-affine aperture fields where long range correlations dominant over short range correlations were generated. The results showed that spatial aperture variations most frequently lead to diminished thermal performance by creating flow channeling that reduces the heat transfer area. Enhanced thermal performance occurred in the less common cases when the aperture was small in the region between the wellbores, causing fluid flow to sweep out greater areas of the fracture and extract heat from a larger area. The standard deviation of the apertures had the largest influence on the thermal performance, while the spatial correlation of the aperture played a secondary role. Larger values of the standard deviation led to more adverse thermal performance. For the range of standard deviations investigated, the fraction of fractures exhibiting enhanced thermal performance compared to the base case of no aperture variations ranged from 34 to 49 %. The degradation of thermal performance due to aperture variations was largest when the well bore spacing was a larger fraction of the fracture diameter. Reservoirs consisting of two non-intersecting fractures connected to the same injection and production wells were also modeled. The uneven split of the flow between the reservoirs in this case caused a further deterioration of thermal performance compared with the single fracture reservoirs. However, flow control was able to overcome nearly all of the additional loss of thermal performance for the multifracture reservoir.","Springer Science + Business Media","","Cornell Univ., Ithaca, NY (United States)","USDOE","","Germany","2015-10-28T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: Geothermal Energy Journal Volume: 3 Journal Issue: 1","","Medium: X","","","EE0000842; EE0006764","Journal ID: ISSN 2195-9706; 21; PII: 39","10.1186/s40517-015-0039-z","","2020-05-19T00:00:00Z","1503035","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/1503035","","Geothermal Energy","1","3"

Beneath the low-permeability cap and the hydrothermal circulation volume, there exists a zone of limited permeability where water does not circulate freely.

"Discovering new events beyond the catalogue—application of empirical matched field processing to Salton Sea geothermal field seismicity","Wang, Jingbo; Templeton, Dennise C.; Harris, David B.","15 GEOTHERMAL ENERGY; 58 GEOSCIENCES","Using empirical matched field processing (MFP), we compare 4 yr of continuous seismic data to a set of 195 master templates from within an active geothermal field and identify over 140 per cent more events than were identified using traditional detection and location techniques alone. In managed underground reservoirs, a substantial fraction of seismic events can be excluded from the official catalogue due to an inability to clearly identify seismic-phase onsets. Empirical MFP can improve the effectiveness of current seismic detection and location methodologies by using conventionally located events with higher signal-to-noise ratios as master events to define wavefield templates that could then be used to map normally discarded indistinct seismicity. Since MFP does not require picking, it can be carried out automatically and rapidly once suitable templates are defined. In this application, we extend MFP by constructing local-distance empirical master templates using Southern California Earthquake Data Center archived waveform data of events originating within the Salton Sea Geothermal Field. We compare the empirical templates to continuous seismic data collected between 1 January 2008 and 31 December 2011. The empirical MFP method successfully identifies 6249 additional events, while the original catalogue reported 4352 events. The majority of these new events are lower-magnitude events with magnitudes between M0.2–M0.8. Here, the increased spatial-temporal resolution of the microseismicity map within the geothermal field illustrates how empirical MFP, when combined with conventional methods, can significantly improve seismic network detection capabilities, which can aid in long-term sustainability and monitoring of managed underground reservoirs.","Oxford University Press","","Lawrence Livermore National Lab.

The factors assessed included the extent of oxidation, changes in thermal behavior, micro-defects, permeation of ionic species from the test environments into the O-rings, silicate-related scale-deposition, and changes in the O-rings' elastic modulus. The reliability of the O-rings to maintain their integrity depended on the elastomeric polymer composition and the exposure environment. FSR disintegrated while EPDM was oxidized only to some degree in all the environments, FKM withstood heat-water quenching but underwent chemical degradation, FEPM survived in all the environments with the exception of heat-water quenching where it underwent severe oxidation-induced degradation, and FFKM displayed outstanding compatibility with all the tested environments.

"Wellbore and groundwater temperature distribution eastern Snake River Plain, Idaho: Implications for groundwater flow and geothermal potential","McLing, Travis L.; Smith, Richard P.; Smith, Robert W.; Blackwell, David D.; Roback, Robert C.; Sondrup, Andrus J.","15 GEOTHERMAL ENERGY; Eastern Snake River Plain; Thermal groundwater tracer; Groundwater flow; Temperature distribution","A map of groundwater temperatures from the Eastern Snake River Plain (ESRP) regional aquifer can be used to identify and interpret important features of the aquifer, including aquifer flow direction, aquifer thickness, and potential geothermal anomalies. The ESRP is an area of high heat flow, yet most of this thermal energy fails to reach the surface, due to the heat being swept downgradient by the aquifer to the major spring complexes near Thousand Springs, ID, a distance of 300 km. Nine deep boreholes that fully penetrate the regional aquifer display three common features: (1) high thermal gradients beneath the aquifer, corresponding to high conductive heat flow in low-permeability hydrothermally-altered rocks; (2) isothermal temperature profiles within the aquifer, characteristic of an actively flowing groundwater; and (3) moderate thermal gradients in the vadose zone with values that indicate that over half of the geothermal heat flow is removed by advective transport in the regional aquifer system. This study utilized temperature data from 250 ESRP aquifer wells to evaluate regional aquifer flow direction, aquifer thickness, and potential geothermal anomalies. Because the thermal gradients are typically low in the aquifer, any measurement of groundwater temperature is a reasonable estimate of temperature throughout the aquifer thickness, allowing the construction of a regional aquifer temperature map for the ESRP. Mapped temperatures are used to identify cold thermal plumes associated with recharge from tributary valleys and adjacent uplands, and warm zones associated with geothermal input to the aquifer. Warm zones in the aquifer can have various causes, including local circulation of groundwater through the deep conductively dominated region, slow groundwater movement in low-permeability regions, or localized heat flow from deeper thermal features.","","","Idaho National Lab.

"Groundwater flow characterization in a fractured bedrock aquifer using active DTS tests in sealed boreholes","Coleman, Thomas I.; Parker, Beth L.; Maldaner, Carlos H.; Mondanos, Michael J.","15 GEOTHERMAL ENERGY; Fractured rock; groundwater flow; distributed temperature sensing; borehole sealing","In recent years, wireline temperature profiling methods have evolved to offer new insight into fractured rock hydrogeology. Important advances in wireline temperature logging in boreholes make use of active line source heating alone and then in combination with temporary borehole sealing with flexible impervious fabric liners to eliminate the effects of borehole cross-connection and recreate natural flow conditions. Here, a characterization technique was developed based on combining fiber optic distributed temperature sensing (DTS) with active heating within boreholes sealed with flexible borehole liners. DTS systems provide a temperature profiling method that offers significantly enhanced temporal resolution when compared with conventional wireline trolling-based techniques that obtain a temperature–depth profile every few hours. The ability to rapidly and continuously collect temperature profiles can better our understanding of transient processes, allowing for improved identification of hydraulically active fractures and determination of relative rates of groundwater flow. Here, the advantage of a sealed borehole environment for DTS-based investigations is demonstrated through a comparison of DTS data from open and lined conditions for the same borehole. Evidence for many depth-discrete active groundwater flow features under natural gradient conditions using active DTS heat pulse testing is presented along with high resolution geologic and geophysical logging and hydraulic datasets. Implications for field implementation are discussed.","Elsevier","","Univ. of Wisconsin, Madison, WI (United States)","USDOE Office of Energy Efficiency and Renewable Energy (EERE), Renewable Power Office.

"Numerical modeling of injection, stress and permeability enhancement during shear stimulation at the Desert Peak Enhanced Geothermal System","Dempsey, David; Kelkar, Sharad; Davatzes, Nicholas; Hickman, Stephen; Moos, Daniel","58 GEOSCIENCES; 15 GEOTHERMAL ENERGY; Desert Peak; Shear stimulation; Permeability enhancement; Thermal stress; Modeling","Creation of an Enhanced Geothermal System relies on stimulation of fracture permeability through self-propping shear failure that creates a complex fracture network with high surface area for efficient heat transfer. In 2010, shear stimulation was carried out in well 27-15 at Desert Peak geothermal field, Nevada, by injecting cold water at pressure less than the minimum principal stress. An order-of-magnitude improvement in well injectivity was recorded. In this work, we describe a numerical model that accounts for injection-induced stress changes and permeability enhancement during this stimulation. We use the coupled thermo-hydrological–mechanical simulator FEHM to (i) construct a wellbore model for non-steady bottom-hole temperature and pressure conditions during the injection, and (ii) apply these pressures and temperatures as a source term in a numerical model of the stimulation. A Mohr–Coulomb failure criterion and empirical fracture permeability is developed to describe permeability evolution of the fractured rock. The numerical model is calibrated using laboratory measurements of material properties on representative core samples and wellhead records of injection pressure and mass flow during the shear stimulation. The model captures both the absence of stimulation at low wellhead pressure (WHP ≤1.7 and ≤2.4 MPa) as well as the timing and magnitude of injectivity rise at medium WHP (3.1 MPa). Results indicate that thermoelastic effects near the wellbore and the associated non-local stresses further from the well combine to propagate a failure front away from the injection well.

"Thermal Drawdown-Induced Flow Channeling in Fractured Geothermal Reservoirs","Fu, Pengcheng; Hao, Yue; Walsh, Stuart D. C.; Carrigan, Charles R.","58 GEOSCIENCES; 15 GEOTHERMAL ENERGY; geothermal; enhanced geothermal system; hot wet rock; thermal breakthrough; flow channeling; THM model","In this paper, we investigate the flow-channeling phenomenon caused by thermal drawdown in fractured geothermal reservoirs. A discrete fracture network-based, fully coupled thermal–hydrological–mechanical simulator is used to study the interactions between fluid flow, temperature change, and the associated rock deformation. The responses of a number of randomly generated 2D fracture networks that represent a variety of reservoir characteristics are simulated with various injection-production well distances. We find that flow channeling, namely flow concentration in cooled zones, is the inevitable fate of all the scenarios evaluated. We also identify a secondary geomechanical mechanism caused by the anisotropy in thermal stress that counteracts the primary mechanism of flow channeling. This new mechanism tends, to some extent, to result in a more diffuse flow distribution, although it is generally not strong enough to completely reverse flow channeling. We find that fracture intensity substantially affects the overall hydraulic impedance of the reservoir but increasing fracture intensity generally does not improve heat production performance. Finally, increasing the injection-production well separation appears to be an effective means to prolong the production life of a reservoir.","Springer","","Lawrence Livermore National Lab.

The practical feasibility of using the ground as a source of renewable energy is clearly demonstrated. Better than 75% of the energy needed for space heating was extracted from the ground. The average monthly electricity consumption for space conditioning was only 40 kWh at summer and winter thermostat set points of 24.4°C and 21.7°C, respectively. The WA-GSHP shared the same 94.5 m vertical bore ground loop with a separate water-to-water ground-source heat pump (WW-GSHP) for meeting domestic hot water needs in the same house. Sources of systemic irreversibility, the main cause of lost work are identified using Exergy and energy analysis. Quantifying the sources of Exergy and energy losses is essential for further systemic improvements. The research findings suggest that the WA-GSHPs are a practical and viable technology to reduce primary energy consumption and greenhouse gas emissions under the IECC 2012 Standard, as well as the European Union (EU) 2020 targets of using renewable energy resources.","Elsevier","","Oak Ridge National Lab.

"Earth Battery","Buscheck, Thomas A.","15 GEOTHERMAL ENERGY; 25 ENERGY STORAGE","It’s the bane of renewable energy. No matter how efficient photovoltaic cells become or how much power a wind turbine can capture, someone will counter with, “What happens when the sun goes down and wind doesn’t blow?” And the person who poses that question uses it as an argument in favor of traditional baseload power. While it’s true that the way the electrical grid has developed in North America and Europe doesn’t lend itself to the start-and-stop, opportunistic nature of wind and solar, there are ways to meet the challenge. Electricity can be stored in batteries or water pumped uphill into reservoirs when power generation exceeds demand, to be tapped when needed. Unfortunately, utility-scale battery storage is prohibitively expensive, and pumped hydro is possible only in particular geographic locations. What is needed is a large-scale, distributed, dispatchable energy storage system that can smooth out a renewable energy generation profile that changes by the minute as well as over the course of the day or the season. Colleagues from Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory, the Ohio State University (led by Jeffrey Bielicki), and the University of Minnesota (led by Jimmy Randolph), and I have developed a system that can do all that. What’s more, this system actually sequesters carbon dioxide—a gas implicated in global climate change—as part of its normal operation. Furthermore, we have modeled our system and found that, if it can be successfully demonstrated in the field, it could provide utility-scale diurnal and seasonal energy storage (many hundreds of MWe) and dispatchable power, while permanently sequestering CO<sub>2</sub> from industrial-scale fossil-energy power plants. Certainly, an energy storage system is only as clean or as green as the primary generation it’s working with. But it is going to be difficult to implement solar or wind power to a degree high enough to make a difference in global carbon dioxide emissions without utility-scale energy storage.","ASME","","Lawrence Livermore National Lab.

This poses the challenge for developing a new unconventional geomechanics approach to stimulate such reservoirs. While a number of new unconventional brittle techniques are still available to improve stimulation on short time scales, the astonishing richness of failure modes of longer time scales in hot rocks has so far been overlooked. These failure modes represent a series of microscopic processes: brittle microfracturing prevails at low temperatures and fairly high deviatoric stresses, while upon increasing temperature and decreasing applied stress or longer time scales, the failure modes switch to transgranular and intergranular creep fractures. Accordingly, fluids play an active role and create their own pathways through facilitating shear localization by a process of time-dependent dissolution and precipitation creep, rather than being a passive constituent by simply following brittle fractures that are generated inside a shear zone caused by other localization mechanisms. We lay out a new paradigm for reservoir stimulation by reactivating pre-existing faults at reservoir scale in a reservoir scale aseismic, ductile manner. A side effect of the new “soft” stimulation method is that owing to the design specification of a macroscopic ductile response, the proposed method offers the potential of a safer control over the stimulation process compared to conventional stimulation protocols such as currently employed in shale gas reservoirs.","China University of Geosciences","","Idaho National Lab.

Concentric rings of injection and production wells are used to create a <i>hydraulic divide</i> to store pressure, CO₂, and thermal energy. Such storage can take excess power from the grid and excess/waste thermal energy, and dispatch that energy when it is demanded, enabling increased penetration of variable renewables.

"Resistance of fly ash-Portland cement blends to thermal shock","Pyatina, Tatiana; Sugama, Toshifumi","15 GEOTHERMAL ENERGY","Thermal-shock resistance of high-content fly ash-Portland cement blends was tested in the following ways. Activated and non-activated blends with 80-90 % fly ash F (FAF) were left to set at room temperature, then hydrated for 24 hours at 85°C and 24-more hours at 300°C and tested in five thermal-shock cycles (600°C heat - 25°C water quenching). XRD, and thermal gravimetric analyses, along with calorimetric measurements and SEM-EDX tests demonstrated that the activated blends form more hydrates after 24 hours at 300°C, and achieve a higher short-term compressive strength than do non-activated ones. Sodium meta-silicate and sodaash engendered the concomitant hydration of OPC and FAF, with the formation of mixed crystalline FAF-OPC hydrates and FAF hydrates, such as garranite, analcime, and wairakite, along with the amorphous FAF hydration products. In SS-activated and non-activated blends separate OPC (tobermorite) and FAF (amorphous gel) hydrates with no mixed crystalline products formed. The compressive strength of all tested blends decreased by nearly 50% after 5 thermal-shock test cycles. These changes in the compressive strength were accompanied by a marked decrease in the intensities of XRD patterns of the crystalline hydrates after the thermalshock. As a result, there was no significant difference in the performance of the blends with different activators","ICE Publishing","","Brookhaven National Lab.

"An efficient optimization of well placement and control for a geothermal prospect under geological uncertainty","Chen, Mingjie; Tompson, Andrew F.B.; Mellors, Robert J.; Abdalla, Osman","15 GEOTHERMAL ENERGY; geothermal; surrogate; optimization; uncertainty; sensitivity","This work applies an efficient optimization technique based on a multivariate adaptive regression spline (MARS) technique to determine the optimal design and engineering of a potential geothermal production operation at a prospect near Superstition Mountain in Southern California, USA. The faster MARS-based statistical model is used as a surrogate for higher-fidelity physical models within the intensive optimization process. Its use allows for the exploration of the impacts of specific engineering design parameters in the context of geologic uncertainty as a means to both understand and maximize profitability of the production operation. The MARS model is initially developed from a training dataset generated by a finite set of computationally complex hydrothermal models applied to the prospect. Its application reveals that the optimal engineering design variables can differ considerably assuming different choices of hydrothermal flow properties, which, in turn, indicates the importance of reducing the uncertainty of key geologic properties. The major uncertainty sources in the natural-system are identified and ranked first by an efficient MARS-enabled total order sensitivity quantification, which is then used to assist evaluating the effect of geological uncertainties on optimized results. At the Southern California prospect, this parameter sensitivity analysis suggests that groundwater circulation through high permeable structures, rather than heat conduction through impermeable granite, is the primary heat transfer method during geothermal extraction. Reservoir histories simulated using optimal parameters with different constraints are analyzed and compared to investigate the longevity and maximum profit of the geothermal resources. The comparison shows that the longevity and profit are very likely to be overestimated by optimizations without appropriate constraints on natural conditions. In addition to geothermal energy production, this optimization approach can also be used to manage other geologic resource operations, such as hydrocarbon production or CO<sub>2</sub> sequestration, under uncertain reservoir conditions.","Elsevier","External Audience (Unlimited)","Lawrence Livermore National Lab.

Fast MARS models are developed from training dataset generated by CPU-intensive hydrothermal models and used as surrogate of high-fidelity physical models in Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) sampling. This Bayesian inference with MARS-enabled MCMC method is used to reduce prior estimates of uncertainty in structural or characteristic hydrothermal flow parameters of the model to posterior distributions. A geothermal prospect near Superstition Mountain in Imperial County of California in USA is used to illustrate the proposed framework and demonstrate the computational efficiency of MARS-based Bayesian inversion. The developed MARS models are also used to efficiently drive calculation of Sobol’ total sensitivity indices. Furthermore, only top sensitive parameters are included in Bayesian inference to further improve the computational efficiency of inversion. Sensitivity analysis also confirms that water circulation through high permeable structures, rather than heat conduction through impermeable granite, is the primary heat transfer method. The presented framework is demonstrated an efficient tool to update knowledge of geothermal prospects by inversing field data.

The information has been included in RTEst through the addition of filters that decrease the potential number of minerals from all possibilities based on the basis species to those that are more relevant to the particular conditions in which the user is interested. The three groups of filters include host rock type (tholeiitic, calc-alkaline, silicic, siliciclastic, carbonate), water type (acidic, neutral), and the temperature range over which the alteration minerals were formed (low, medium, high). The user-chosen mineral assemblage is checked to make sure that it does not violate the Gibbs phase rule. The user can select one of three mineral saturation weighting schemes that decrease the chance the optimization from being skewed by reaction stoichiometry or analytical uncertainty.","Geothermal Resources Council","","Idaho National Lab.

We also analyze the potential for injection-induced fracturing and reactivation of natural fractures in a porous medium with associated permeability enhancement. Our analysis aims to understand how far the EGS reservoir may grow and how the hydroshearing process relates to system conditions. We analyze the enhanced reservoir, or hydrosheared zone, by studying the extent of the failure zone using an elasto-plastic model, and accounting for permeability changes as a function of the induced stresses. For both fully saturated and unsaturated medium cases, the results demonstrate how EGS reservoir growth depends on the initial fluid phase, and how the reservoir extent changes as a function of two critical parameters: (1) the coefficient of friction, and (2) the permeability-enhancement factor. Furthermore, while well stimulation is driven by pressure exceeding the hydroshearing threshold, the modeling also demonstrates how injection-induced cooling further extends the effects of stimulation.","Springer","","Lawrence Berkeley National Lab.

X-ray computed tomography (XRCT) provides a method that can nondestructively probe these changes in three dimensions. Here, we describe a method for extracting subvoxel mineralogical and chemical information from synchrotron XRCT images by combining advanced image segmentation with geochemical models of cement alteration. The method relies on determining “effective linear activity coefficients” (ELAC) for the white light source to generate calibration curves that relate the image grayscales to material composition. The resulting data set supports the modeling of cement alteration by CO<sub>2</sub>-rich brine with discrete increases in calcium concentration at reaction boundaries. The results of these XRCT analyses can be used to further improve coupled geochemical and mechanical models of cement alteration in the wellbore environment.","American Chemical Society (ACS)","","Lawrence Livermore National Lab.

The viscosities of the polar SPS solutions were measured and ranged from near water in dilute systems through to gel formation at high concentrations. The van't Hoff indices for SPS solutions were measured through freezing point depression studies as a proxy for osmotic pressures. A new form of SPS with an amine : carbonate ratio significantly greater than unity has been identified. Tertiary amines that function as SPS at ambient pressures appear to be limited to molecules with fewer than 12 carbons.

Filling this gap in our knowledge of viruses will enhance our understanding of the relationships between RNA viruses from the three domains of cellular life and, in particular, could shed light on the origin of the enormous diversity of RNA viruses infecting eukaryotes. We describe here the identification of novel RNA viral genome segments from high-temperature acidic hot springs in Yellowstone National Park in the United States. These hot springs harbor low-complexity cellular communities dominated by several species of hyperthermophilic Archaea. A viral metagenomics approach was taken to assemble segments of these RNA virus genomes from viral populations isolated directly from hot spring samples. Analysis of these RNA metagenomes demonstrated unique gene content that is not generally related to known RNA viruses of Bacteria and Eukarya. However, genes for RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp), a hallmark of positive-strand RNA viruses, were identified in two contigs. One of these contigs is approximately 5,600 nucleotides in length and encodes a polyprotein that also contains a region homologous to the capsid protein of nodaviruses, tetraviruses, and birnaviruses. Phylogenetic analyses of the RdRps encoded in these contigs indicate that the putative archaeal viruses form a unique group that is distinct from the RdRps of RNA viruses of Eukarya and Bacteria. Collectively, our findings suggest the existence of novel positive-strand RNA viruses that probably replicate in hyperthermophilic archaeal hosts and are highly divergent from RNA viruses that infect eukaryotes and even more distant from known bacterial RNA viruses. These positive-strand RNA viruses might be direct ancestors of RNA viruses of eukaryotes.","","","Idaho National Lab.

Water temperature increases at the upgradient extraction wells in the system and at the downgradient Columbia River are potential concerns, especially since heat rejection to the subsurface will occur year-round. Hence, thermal impacts of the open-loop GSHP were investigated to identify operational scenarios that minimized downgradient environmental impacts at the river, and upgradient temperature drift at the production wells. Simulations examined the sensitivity of the system to variations in pumping rates and injected water temperatures, as well as to hydraulic conductivity estimates of the aquifer. Results demonstrated that both downgradient and upgradient thermal impacts were more sensitive to injection flow rates than estimates of hydraulic conductivity. Higher injection rates at lower temperatures resulted in higher temperature increases at the extraction wells but lower increases at the river. Conversely, lower pumping rates and higher injected water temperatures resulted in a smaller temperature increase at the extraction wells, but higher increases at the river. The scenario with lower pumping rates is operationally more efficient, but does increase the likelihood of a thermal plume discharging into the Columbia River. However, this impact would be mitigated by mixing within the hyporheic zone and the Columbia River. The impact under current operational conditions is negligible, but future increases in heat rejection could require a compromise between maximizing operational efficiency and minimizing temperature increases at the shoreline.","","","Pacific Northwest National Lab.

The highest and lowest heating COP achieved was 4.90 (October) and 3.44 (February), respectively. The highest and lowest cooling COP achieved was 6.09 (April) and 3.88 (August). These COPs are calculated on the basis of the total power input (including duct, ground loop, and control power losses ). The second Law (Exergy) analysis provides deep insight into how systemic inefficiencies are distributed among the various GSHP components. Opportunities for design and further performance improvements are identified. Through Exergy analysis we provide a true measure of how closely actual performance approaches the ideal, and it unequivocally identifies, better than energy analysis does, the sources and causes of lost work, the root cause of system inefficiencies.","","","Oak Ridge National Lab.

This approach is being applied to boilers in other studies and offers the potential to make a small number of simple measurements to obtain the model parameters. These parameters can then be used to predict performance under complex load patterns. Both condensing and non-condensing water heaters have been tested under a very wide range of load conditions.

The Portable Multi-use Automated Concentration System (PMACS) was designed for concentrating microorganisms from large volumes of water in the field and was assessed for enhancing surveillance of L. pneumophila at the Savannah River Site, SC. PMACS samples (100 L; n = 28) were collected from six towers between August 2010 and April 2011 with grab samples (500 ml; n = 56) being collected before and after each PMACS sample. All samples were analyzed for the presence of L. pneumophila by direct fluorescence immunoassay (DFA) using FITC-labeled monoclonal antibodies targeting serogroups 1, 2, 4 and 6. QPCR was utilized for detection of Legionella spp. in the same samples. Counts of L. pneumophila from DFA and of Legionella spp. from qPCR were normalized to cells/L tower water. Concentrations were similar between grab and PMACS samples collected throughout the study by DFA analysis (P = 0.4461; repeated measures ANOVA). The same trend was observed with qPCR. However, PMACS concentration proved advantageous over membrane filtration by providing larger volume, more representative samples of the cooling tower environment, which led to reduced variability among sampling events and increasing the probability of detection of low level targets. These data highlight the utility of the PMACS for enhanced surveillance of L. pneumophila by providing improved sampling of the cooling tower environment.","","available","Savannah River Site (SRS), Aiken, SC (United States)","USDOE","","United States","2011-10-10T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: Journal of Applied Environmental Microbiology","","Medium: ED","","SRNL-MS-2011-00192","DE-AC09-08SR22470","TRN: US201121%%129","","","2011-12-05T00:00:00Z","1026835","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/1026835","https://www.osti.gov/servlets/purl/1026835","Journal of Applied Environmental Microbiology","",""

Arsenic (As) in particular is a common component in geothermal fluids and leads to a degradation of water quality when present in mobile and bioavailable forms. We have examined changes in arsenic speciation caused by quick transition from high temperature reducing conditions to surface conditions, retention mechanisms, and the extent of transport associated with the release of spent geothermal fluids at the Dachny geothermal fields (Mutnovsky geothermal region), Kamchatka, Russia -- a high temperature field used for electricity production. In the spent fluids, the arsenic concentration reaches 9 ppm, while in natural hot springs expressed in the vicinity of the field, the As concentration is typically below 10 ppb. The aqueous phase arsenic speciation was determined using Liquid Chromatography (LC) coupled to an Inductively Coupled Plasma Mass Spectrometer (ICP-MS). The arsenic speciation in the bottom sediments (&lt; 65 {mu}m fraction) of the local surface waters was analyzed using X-ray Absorption Spectroscopy (XAS). Arsenic in the geothermal source fluids is predominantly found as As(III), while a mixture of As(III)/As(V) is found in the water and sediment of the Falshivaia River downstream from the power plant. The extent of elevated arsenic concentrations in water is limited by adsorption to the bottom sediment and dilution, as determined using Cl{sup -} from the deep well fluids as a tracer. Analysis of the Extended X-ray Absorption Fine Structure (EXAFS) spectra shows that sediment phase arsenic is associated with both Al- and Fe-rich phases with a bi-dentate corner sharing local geometry. The geothermal waste fluids released in the surface water create a localized area of arsenic contamination. The extent of transport of dissolved As is limited to {approx}7 km downstream from the source, while As associated with bottom sediment travels {approx}3 km farther.","","","Argonne National Lab.

This paper compares the energy performance of three HVAC systems: a direct expansion (DX) split system, a split air source heat pump (ASHP) system, and a closed-loop water source heat pump (WSHP) system with a boiler and an evaporative fluid cooler as the central heating and cooling source. All three systems use gas furnace for heating or heating backup. The comparison is made in a number of scenarios including different climate conditions, system operation schemes and applicable building codes. It is found that with the minimum code-compliant equipment efficiency, ASHP performs the best among all scenarios except in extremely code climates. WSHP tends to perform better than the split DX system in cold climates but worse in hot climates.","","","Pacific Northwest National Lab.

Windows typically account for about 30-50 percent of the transmission losses though the building envelope, even if their area fraction of the envelope is far less. The reason for this can be found by comparing the thermal transmittance (U-factor) of windows to the U-factor of their opaque counterparts (wall, roof and floor constructions). In well insulated buildings the U-factor of walls, roofs an floors can be between 0.1-0.2 W/(m2K). The best windows have U-values of about 0.7-1.0. It is therefore obvious that the U-factor of windows needs to be reduced, even though looking at the whole energy balance for windows (i.e. solar gains minus transmission losses) makes the picture more complex.In high performance windows the frame design and material use is of utmost importance, as the frame performance is usually the limiting factor for reducing the total window U-factor further. This paper describes simulation studies analyzing the effects on frame and edge-of-glass U-factors of different surface emissivities as well as frame material and spacer conductivities. The goal of this work is to define materials research targets for window frame components that will result in better frame thermal performance than is exhibited by the best products available on the market today.","","","Lawrence Berkeley National Lab.

However, the routine three-dimensional (3D) interpretation of voluminous induced polarization (IP) data sets still poses a challenge due to large computational demands and solution nonuniqueness. We have developed a flexible methodology for 3D (spectral) IP data inversion. Our inversion algorithm is adapted from a frequency-domain electromagnetic (EM) inversion method primarily developed for large-scale hydrocarbon and geothermal energy exploration purposes. The method has proven to be efficient by implementing the nonlinear conjugate gradient method with hierarchical parallelism and by using an optimal finite-difference forward modeling mesh design scheme. The method allows for a large range of survey scales, providing a tool for both exploration and environmental applications. We experimented with an image focusing technique to improve the poor depth resolution of surface data sets with small survey spreads. The algorithm's underlying forward modeling operator properly accounts for EM coupling effects; thus, traditionally used EM coupling correction procedures are not needed. The methodology was applied to both synthetic and field data. We tested the benefit of directly inverting EM coupling contaminated data using a synthetic large-scale exploration data set. Afterward, we further tested the monitoring capability of our method by inverting time-lapse data from an environmental remediation experiment near Rifle, Colorado. Similar trends observed in both our solution and another 2D inversion were in accordance with previous findings about the IP effects due to subsurface microbial activity.","","","Lawrence Berkeley National Lab.

Analytical solutions have been developed for tracer transport in both single-fracture and multiple-fracture systems associated with these reactions under transient and steady-state transport conditions. These solutions also take into account advective transport in fractures and molecular diffusion in the rock matrix. For studying distributions of disturbed tracer concentration (the difference between actual concentration and its equilibrium value), effects of precipitation-dissolution reactions are mathematically equivalent to a 'decay' process with a decay constant proportional to the corresponding bulk reaction rate. This important feature significantly simplifies the derivation procedure by taking advantage of the existence of analytical solutions for tracer transport associated with radioactive decay in fractured rock. It is also useful for interpreting tracer breakthrough curves, because the impact of a decay process is relatively easy to analyze. Several illustrative examples are presented, which show that the results are sensitive to fracture spacing, matrix diffusion coefficient (fracture surface area), and bulk reaction rate (or 'decay' constant), indicating that the relevant flow and transport parameters may be estimated by analyzing tracer signals.","","","Lawrence Berkeley National Lab.

In this report, sediment samples collected before and after acetate field addition were used to assess the active microbes via {sup 13}C acetate stable isotope probing on 3 phases [coarse sand, fines (8-approximately 150 {micro}m), groundwater (0.2-8 {micro}m)] over a 24-day time frame. TRFLP results generally indicated a stronger signal in {sup 13}C-DNA in the 'fines' fraction compared to the sand and groundwater. Before the field-scale acetate addition, a Geobacter-like group primarily synthesized {sup 13}C-DNA in the groundwater phase, an alpha Proteobacterium primarily grew on the fines/sands, and an Acinetobacter sp. and Decholoromonas-like OTU utilized much of the {sup 13}C acetate in both groundwater and particle-associated phases. At the termination of the field-scale acetate addition, the Geobacter-like species was active on the solid phases rather than the groundwater, while the other bacterial groups had very reduced newly synthesized DNA signal. These findings will help to delineate the acetate utilization patterns of bacteria in the field and can lead to improved methods for stimulating distinct microbial populations in situ.","","","Lawrence Berkeley National Lab.

However, as temperature decreases, disequilibrium mineral assemblages may occur due to the slow kinetics of reaction involving the minerals and fluids. In this study, we conducted a series of experiments in which hematite or magnetite was reacted with an acidic solution under H{sub 2}-rich hydrothermal conditions (T = 100-250 C, P{sub H{sub 2}} = 0.05-5 MPa) to investigate the kinetics of redox and non-redox transformations between hematite and magnetite, and the mechanisms of iron oxide transformation under hydrothermal conditions. The formation of euhedral crystals of hematite in 150 and 200 C experiments, in which magnetite was used as the starting material, indicates that non-redox transformation of magnetite to hematite occurred within 24 h. The chemical composition of the experimental solutions was controlled by the non-redox transformation between magnetite and hematite throughout the experiments. While solution compositions were controlled by the non-redox transformation in the first 3 days in a 250 C experiment, reductive dissolution of magnetite became important after 5 days and affected the solution chemistry. At 100 C, the presence of maghemite was indicated in the first 7 days. Based on these results, equilibrium constants of non-redox transformation between magnetite and hematite and those of non-redox transformation between magnetite and maghemite were calculated. Our results suggest that the redox transformation of hematite to magnetite occurs in the following steps: (1) reductive dissolution of hematite to Fe{sub (aq)}{sup 2+} and (2) non-redox transformation of hematite and Fe{sub (aq)}{sup 2+} to magnetite.","","","Oak Ridge National Lab.

Yet despite studies demonstrating significant energy savings from ground-source heat pump (GSHP) systems, their adoption has been hindered by high upfront costs. Fewer than 1% of US homes use a GSHP system. However, compared to a minimum-code-compliant conventional space-conditioning system, when properly designed and installed, a GSHP retrofit at current market prices offers simple payback of 4.3 years on national average, considering existing federal tax credits. Most people understand how air-source heat pumps work: they move heat from indoor air to outdoor air when cooling and from outdoor air to indoor air when heating. The ground-source heat pump operates on the same principle, except that it moves heat to or from the ground source instead of outdoor air. The ground source is usually a vertical or horiontal ground heat exchanger. Because the ground usually has a more favorable temperature than ambient air for the heating and cooling operation of the vapor-compression refrigeration cycle, GSHP sysems can operate with much higher energy efficiencies than air-source heat pump systems when properly designed and installed. A GSHP system used in a residual building typically provides space conditioning and hot water and comprises three major components: a water-source heat pump unit designed to operate at a wider range of entering fluid temperatures (typically from 30 F to 110 F, or 1 C to 43 C) than a conventional water-source heat pump unit; a ground heat exchanger (GHX); and distribution systems to deliver hot water to the storage tank and heating or cooling to the conditioned rooms. In most residual GSHP systems, the circulation pumps and associated valves are integrated with the heat pump to circulate the heat-carrier fluid (water or aqueous antifreeze solution) through the heat pump and the GHX. A recent assessment indicates that if 20% of US homes replaced their existing space-conditioning and water-heating systems with properly designed, installed and operated state-of-the-art GSHP systems, it would yield significant benefits each year. These include 0.8 quad British thermal units (Btu) of primary energy savings, 54.3 million metric tons of CO{sub 2} emission reductions, $10.4 billion in energy cost savings and 43.2 gigawatts of reduction in summer peak electrical demand.","","","Oak Ridge National Lab.

However, as temperature decreases, disequilibrium mineral assemblages may occur due to the slow kinetics of reaction involving the minerals and fluids. In this study, we conducted a series of experiments in which hematite or magnetite was reacted with an acidic solution under H2-rich hydrothermal conditions (T = 100 250 C,) to investigate the kinetics of redox and non-redox transformations between hematite and magnetite, and the mechanisms of iron oxide transformation under hydrothermal conditions. The formation of euhedral crystals of hematite in 150 and 200 C experiments, in which magnetite was used as the starting material, indicates that non-redox transformation of magnetite to hematite occurred within 24 h. The chemical composition of the experimental solutions was controlled by the non-redox transformation between magnetite and hematite throughout the experiments. While solution compositions were controlled by the non-redox transformation in the first 3 days in a 250 C experiment, reductive dissolution of magnetite became important after 5 days and affected the solution chemistry. At 100 C, the presence of maghemite was indicated in the first 7 days. Based on these results, equilibrium constants of non-redox transformation between magnetite and hematite and those of non-redox transformation between magnetite and maghemite were calculated. Our results suggest that the redox transformation of hematite to magnetite occurs in the following steps: (1) reductive dissolution of hematite to and (2) non-redox transformation of hematite and to magnetite.","","","Oak Ridge National Lab.

The type virus, Sulfolobus spindle-shaped virus 1 (SSV1), has a double-stranded DNA genome that contains 34 open reading frames (ORFs). Fuselloviral genomes show little similarity to other organisms, generally precluding functional predictions. However, tertiary protein structure can provide insight into protein function. We have thus undertaken a systematic investigation of the SSV1 proteome and report here on the F112 gene product. Biochemical, proteomic and structural studies reveal a monomeric intracellular protein that adopts a winged helix DNA binding fold. Notably, the structure contains an intrachain disulfide bond, prompting analysis of cysteine usage in this and other hyperthermophilic viral genomes. The analysis supports a general abundance of disulfide bonds in the intracellular proteins of hyperthermophilic viruses, and reveals decreased cysteine content in the membrane proteins of hyperthermophilic viruses infecting Sulfolobales. The evolutionary implications of the SSV1 distribution are discussed.","","","SLAC National Accelerator Lab., Menlo Park, CA (United States)","USDOE","","United States","2009-05-26T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: Virology 376:270,2008; Journal Volume: 376; Journal Issue: 2","","Medium: X","","SLAC-REPRINT-2009-267","AC02-76SF00515","Journal ID: ISSN 0042-6822; VIRLAX; TRN: US201002%%1444","","","2010-02-18T00:00:00Z","953616","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/953616","","Virology 376:270,2008","2","376"

Unique phase transition behavior during heating is found for the Li0.33Ni1/3Co1/3Mn1/3O2 cathode samples: when no electrolyte is present, the initial layered structure changes first to a LiM2O4-type spinel, and then to a M3O4-type spinel and remains in this structure up to 600 C. For the Li0.33Ni1/3Co1/3Mn1/3O2 cathode sample with electrolyte, additional phase transition from the M3O4-type spinel to the MO-type rock salt phase takes place from about 400 to 441 C together with the formation of metallic phase at about 460 C. The major difference between this type of phase transitions and that for Li0.27Ni0.8Co0.15Al0.05O2 in the presence of electrolyte is the delayed phase transition from the spinel-type to the rock salt-type phase by stretching the temperature range of spinel phases from about 20 to 140 C. This unique behavior is considered as the key factor of the better thermal stability of the Li1-xNi1/3Co1/3Mn1/3O2 cathode materials.","","","Brookhaven National Lab.

Bacteria of the genus Exiguobacterium are low G + C, Gram-positive facultative anaerobes that have been repeatedly isolated from ancient Siberian permafrost. In addition, Exiguobacterium spp. have been isolated from markedly diverse sources, including Greenland Glacial ice, hot springs at Yellowstone National Park, the rhizosphere of plants, and the environment of food processing plants. Strains of this hereto little known bacterium that have been retrieved from such different (and often extreme) environments are worthy of attention as they are likely to be specifically adapted to such environments and to carry variations in the genome which may correspond to psychrophilic and thermophilic adaptations. However, comparative genomic investigations of Exiguobacterium spp. from different sources have been limited. In this study, we employed different molecular approaches for the comparative analysis of 24 isolates from markedly diverse environments including ancient Siberian permafrost and hot springs at Yellowstone National Park. Pulsed-field gel electrophoresis (PFGE) with I-CeuI (an intron-encoded endonuclease), AscI and NotI were optimized for the determination of genomic fingerprints of nuclease-producing isolates. The application of a DNA macroarray for 82 putative stress-response genes yielded strain-specific hybridization profiles. Cluster analyses of 16S rRNA gene sequence data, PFGE I-CeuI restriction patterns and hybridization profiles suggested that Exiguobacterium strains formed two distinct divisions that generally agreed with temperature ranges for growth. With few exceptions (e.g., Greenland ice isolate GIC31), psychrotrophic and thermophilic isolates belonged to different divisions.","","","Oak Ridge National Lab.

C at economic drilling depths can be found east of the Rocky Mountains. The object of this paper is to present new heat flow data and to evaluate the geothermal potential of Texas and adjacent areas. The new data show that, west of the Ouachita Thrust Belt, the heat flow values are lower than east of the fault zone. Basement heat flow values for the Palo Duro and Fort Worth Basins are below 50 mW/m{sup 2} while, in the frontal zone of the belt, they can exceed 60 mW/m{sup 2}. Further east, along the Balcones fault system the heat flow is in general higher than 55 mW/m{sup 2}. The eastern most heat flow sites are in Louisiana and they show very high heat flow (over 80 mW/m{sup 2}), which is associated with the apparently highly radioactive basement of the Sabine uplift. The geothermal resource in this area is large and diverse, and can be divided in high grade (temperature above 150 deg. C) convective systems, conductive based enhanced geothermal systems and geothermal/geopressured systems. One of the most attractive areas east of the cordillera extends from eastern Texas across Louisiana and Arkansas to western Mississippi. Here temperatures reach exploitation range at depths below 4 km, and tapping such a resource from shut in hydrocarbon fields is relatively easy. The initial costs of the development can be greatly reduced if existing hydrocarbon infrastructure is used, and therefore using shut-in hydrocarbon fields for geothermal purposes should not be neglected.","","","","","","United States","2008-12-15T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: Natural Resources Research (New York, N.Y.); Journal Volume: 17; Journal Issue: 4; Other Information: DOI: 10.1007/s11053-008-9081-x; Copyright (c) 2008 International Association for Mathematical Geology; Article Copyright (c) 2008 The Author(s); http://www.springer-ny.com; Country of input: International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA)","","Medium: X; Size: page(s) 227-243","","","","Journal ID: ISSN 1520-7439; TRN: US09K1436101899","10.1007/S11053-008-9081-X","","2010-06-03T00:00:00Z","21238858","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/21238858","","Natural Resources Research (New York, N.Y.)","4","17"

By combining these measurements with {mu}-XRF imaging, it is possible to distinguish inhomogeneities in Eu{sup 2+}/Eu{sup 3+} ratios that developed during mineral precipitation from the effects of subsequent hydrothermal alteration and weathering. Thermodynamic analysis reveals that under the conditions typical of the formation of many Au deposits, the Eu{sup 2+}/Eu{sup 3+} ratio in the hydrothermal fluid is highly sensitive to pH. The range in pH calculated from the Eu{sup 2+}/Eu{sup 3+} ratios in the analyzed scheelite corresponds to a maximum in Au solubility under the ore-forming conditions, and suggests buffering of pH by the CO{sub 2(aq)}-rich fluid. The primary heterogeneity of the Karlgoorlie scheelite most likely results form pH oscillating between fluid- and rock-buffered conditions, and reflects the dynamics of the hydrothermal system.","Elsevier","","Argonne National Lab.

Improved technologies have the potential to access untapped geothermal energy sources, which experts estimate to be greater than 100,000 MWe. However, many technical challenges in areas such as exploration, drilling, reservoir engineering, and energy conversion must be addressed if the United States is to unlock the full potential of Earth's geothermal energy and displace fossil fuels. (For example, see Tester et al., 2006; Green and Nix, 2006; and Western Governors Association, 2006.) Achieving next-generation geothermal power requires both basic science and applied technology to identify prospective resources and effective extraction strategies. Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory (LLNL) has a long history of research and development work in support of geothermal power. Key technologies include advances in scaling and brine chemistry, economic and resource assessment, direct use, exploration, geophysics, and geochemistry. For example, a high temperature, multi-spacing, multi-frequency downhole EM induction logging tool (GeoBILT) was developed jointly by LLNL and EMI to enable the detection and orientation of fractures and conductive zones within the reservoir (Figure 1). Livermore researchers also conducted studies to determine how best to stave off increased salinity in the Salton Sea, an important aquatic ecosystem in California. Since 1995, funding for LLNL's geothermal research has decreased, but the program continues to make important contributions to sustain the nation's energy future. The current efforts, which are highlighted in this report, focus on developing an Engineered Geothermal System (EGS) and on improving technologies for exploration, monitoring, characterization, and geochemistry. Future research will also focus on these areas.","","","Lawrence Livermore National Lab.

L. Renner, Idaho National Laboratory Geothermal energy is used to produce electricity in 24 countries. The United States has the largest capacity (2,544 MWe) followed by Philippines (1,931 MWe), Mexico (953 MWe), Indonesia (797 MWe), and Italy (791 MWe) (Bertani, 2005). When Chevron Corporation purchased Unocal Corporation they became the leading producer of geothermal energy worldwide with projects in Indonesia and the Philippines. The U. S. geothermal industry is booming thanks to increasing energy prices, renewable portfolio standards, and a production tax credit. California (2,244 MWe) is the leading producer, followed by Nevada (243 MWe), Utah (26 MWe) and Hawaii (30 MWe) and Alaska (0.4 MWe) (Bertani, 2005). Alaska joined the producing states with two 0.4 KWe power plants placed on line at Chena Hot Springs during 2006. The plant uses 30 liters per second of 75°C water from shallow wells. Power production is assisted by the availability of gravity fed, 7°C cooling water (http://www.yourownpower.com/) A 13 MWe binary power plant is expected to begin production in the fall of 2007 at Raft River in southeastern Idaho. Idaho also is a leader in direct use of geothermal energy with the state capital building and several other state and Boise City buildings as well as commercial and residential space heated using fluids from several, interconnected geothermal systems. The Energy Policy Act of 2005 modified leasing provisions and royalty rates for both geothermal electrical production and direct use. Pursuant to the legislation the Bureau of Land management and Minerals Management Service published final regulations for continued geothermal leasing, operations and royalty collection in the Federal Register (Vol. 72, No. 84 Wednesday May 2, 2007, BLM p. 24358-24446, MMS p. 24448-24469). Existing U. S. plants focus on high-grade geothermal systems located in the west. However, interest in non-traditional geothermal development is increasing. A comprehensive new MIT-led study of the potential for geothermal energy within the United States predicts that mining the huge amounts of stored thermal energy in the Earth’s crust not associated with hydrothermal systems, could supply a substantial portion of U.S. electricity with minimal environmental impact (Tester, et al., 2006, available at http://geothermal.inl.gov). There is also renewed interest in geothermal production from other non-traditional sources such as the overpressured zones in the Gulf Coast and warm water co-produced with oil and gas. Ormat Technologies, Inc., a major geothermal company, recently acquired geothermal leases in the offshore overpressured zone of Texas. Ormat and the Rocky Mountain Oilfield Testing Center recently announced plans to jointly produce geothermal power from co-produced water from the Teapot Dome oilfield (Casper Star-Tribune, March 2, 2007). RMOTC estimates that 300 KWe capacity is available from the 40,000 BWPD of 88°C water associated with oil production from the Tensleep Sandstone (Milliken, 2007). The U. S. Department of Energy is seeking industry partners to develop electrical generation at other operating oil and gas fields (for more information see: https://e-center.doe.gov/iips/faopor.nsf/UNID/50D3734745055A73852572CA006665B1?OpenDocument).

While its function is unknown, orthologs are found in three additional crenarchaeal viral families. Due to the central importance of this protein family to crenarchaeal viruses, we have undertaken structural and biochemical studies of B116. The structure reveals a previously unobserved fold consisting of a five-stranded beta-sheet flanked on one side by three alpha helices. Two subunits come together to form a homodimer with a 10-stranded mixed beta-sheet, where the topology of the central strands resembles an unclosed beta-barrel. Highly conserved loops rise above the surface of the saddle-shaped protein and suggest an interaction with the major groove of DNA. The predicted B116-DNA interaction is confirmed by electrophoretic mobility shift assays.","","","SLAC National Accelerator Lab., Menlo Park, CA (United States)","USDOE","","United States","2007-07-09T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: Virology 363:387-396,2007; Journal Volume: 363","","Medium: X","","SLAC-REPRINT-2007-076","AC02-76SF00515","Journal ID: ISSN 0042-6822; VIRLAX; TRN: US200723%%208","10.1016/j.virol.2007.01.027","","2009-12-16T00:00:00Z","909818","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/909818","","Virology 363:387-396,2007","","363"

Several mechanisms for recent CH4 release have been proposed including subsurface biological methanogenesis, abiogenic hydrothermal and/or volcanic activity, dissociation of CH4 hydrates, atmospheric photolysis, or addition of organics via bolide impact. This study examines the effects of increasing salinity on gas hydrate stability and compares estimates of the Martian geothermal gradient to CH4 and CO2 hydrate stability fields in the presence of high salinity brines. The results demonstrate that salinity increases alone result in a significant decrease in the predicted hydrate stability zone within the Martian subsurface and may be a driving force in CH4 hydrate destabilization. Active thermal and/or pressure fluctuations are not required in order for CH4 hydrates to be the source of atmospheric CH4.","","","Oak Ridge National Lab.

"Abiotic Formation of Hydrocarbons Under Hydrothermal Conditions: Constraints from Chemical and Isotope Data","Fu, Q.; Lollar, Barbara Sherwood; Horita, Juske; Lacrampe-Couloume, Georges; Seyfried, W.

A robust technique for sample storage and transfer from experimental apparatus to stable isotope mass spectrometer provides a methodology for integration of both carbon and hydrogen isotope characterization of reactants and products generated during abiogenic synthesis experiments. Experiments were performed with and without pretreatment of magnetite to remove background carbon associated with the mineral catalyst. Prior to experiments, the abundance and carbon isotope composition of all carbon-bearing components were determined. Time-series samples of the fluid from all experiments indicated significant concentrations of dissolved CO and C{sub 1}-C{sub 3} hydrocarbons and relatively large changes in dissolved CO{sub 2} and H{sub 2} concentrations, consistent with formation of additional hydrocarbon components beyond C{sub 3}. The existence of relatively high dissolved alkanes in the experiment involving non-pretreated magnetite in particular, suggests a complex catalytic process, likely involving reinforcing effects of mineral-derived carbon with newly synthesized hydrocarbons at the magnetite surface. Similar reactions may be important mechanisms for carbon reduction in chemically complex natural hydrothermal systems. In spite of evidence supporting abiotic hydrocarbon formation in all experiments, an 'isotopic reversal' trend was not observed for {sup 13}C values of dissolved alkanes with increasing carbon number. This may relate to the specific mechanism of carbon reduction and hydrocarbon chain growth under hydrothermal conditions at elevated temperatures and pressures. Over time, significant {sup 13}C depletion in CH{sub 4} suggests either depolymerization reactions occurring in addition to synthesis, or reactions between the C{sub 1}-C{sub 3} hydrocarbons and carbon species absorbed on mineral surfaces and in solution.","","","Oak Ridge National Lab.

"Assessment of the Enhanced Geothermal System Resource Base of the United States","Blackwell, David D., E-mail: blackwel@smu.edu; Negraru, Petru T; Richards, Maria C","15 GEOTHERMAL ENERGY; ECONOMIC POLICY; ENERGY POLICY; GEOLOGIC MODELS; GEOTHERMAL ENERGY; GEOTHERMAL SYSTEMS; HYDROCARBONS; MAPS; NATURAL GAS FIELDS; SEDIMENTS; THERMAL CONDUCTIVITY; USA","This paper describes an assessment of the enhanced geothermal system (EGS) resource base of the conterminous United States, using constructed temperature at depth maps. The temperature at depth maps were computed from 3 to 10 km, for every km. The methodology is described. Factors included are sediment thickness, thermal conductivity variations, distribution of the radioactive heat generation and surface temperature based on several geologic models of the upper 10 km of the crust. EGS systems are extended in this paper to include coproduced geothermal energy, and geopressured resources.A table is provided that summarizes the resource base estimates for all components of the EGS geothermal resource. By far, the conduction-dominated components of EGS represent the largest component of the U.S. resource. Nonetheless, the coproduced resources and geopressured resources are large and significant targets for short and intermediate term development. There is a huge resource base between the depths of 3 and 8 km, where the temperature reaches 150-250{sup o}C. Even if only 2% of the conventional EGS resource is developed, the energy recovered would be equivalent to roughly 2,500 times the annual consumption of primary energy in the U.S. in 2006. Temperatures above 150{sup o}C at those depths are more common in the active tectonic regions of the western conterminous U.S., but are not confined to those areas. In the central and eastern U.S. there are identified areas of moderate size that are of reasonable grade and probably small areas of much higher grade than predicted by this analyses. However because of the regional (the grid size is 5' x 5') scale of this study such potentially promising sites remain to be identified.Several possible scenarios for EGS development are discussed. The most promising and least costly may to be developments in abandoned or shut-in oil and gas fields, where the temperatures are high enough. Because thousands of wells are already drilled in those locations, the cost of producing energy from such fields could be significantly lowered. In addition many hydrocarbon fields are producing large amounts of co-produced water, which is necessary for geothermal development. Although sustainability is not addressed in this study, the resource is so large that in at least some scenarios of development the geothermal resource is sustainable for long periods of time.","","","","","","United States","2006-12-15T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: Natural Resources Research (New York, N.Y.); Journal Volume: 15; Journal Issue: 4; Other Information: DOI: 10.1007/s11053-007-9028-7; Copyright (c) 2007 Springer Science+Business Media, LLC; http://www.springer-ny.com; Country of input: International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA)","","Medium: X; Size: page(s) 283-308","","","","Journal ID: ISSN 1520-7439; TRN: US07K1718079156","10.1007/S11053-007-9028-7","","2010-06-03T00:00:00Z","21064190","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/21064190","","Natural Resources Research (New York, N.Y.)","4","15"

XAFS spectra were acquired at the Ca K-edge at temperatures up to 400 C and pressures up to 350 bar. For the system at 400 C, both Ca (4038.5 eV) and Cl (2822.4 eV) K-edge data were acquired and a global model was used to fit the two independent sets of XAFS data. Measurements were made at the bending magnet beamline (sector 20) at the Advanced Photon Source, Argonne. Above 250 C, a significant number of Ca2+-Cl- direct contact ion pairs form in agreement with existing thermodynamic data for this system. For a 1 m CaCl2 solution at 400 C, the mean coordination structure about Ca2+ contains 3.2 ? 0.6 water molecules at an average Ca-O distance of 2.356 ?0.026 ? and 1.8 ? 0.7 Cl- at a Ca-Cl distance of 2.677 ? 0.007 ?. An evaluation of the Ca and Cl pre-edge and near-edge (XANES) spectrum provided further confirmation of the change in the Ca2+ first-shell structure and symmetry. Overall these measurements provide a structural basis for understanding solvation of Ca2+ in hydrothermal systems. These results also provide important new insights into the structural aspects of Ca2+ ion pairing that are the basis of many biological processes under ambient conditions.","","","Pacific Northwest National Lab.

Transport of the fluorocarbon compounds was explored in flowing helium at 23 and 60 °C. This work found that fluorocarbon retention is strongly affected by sand moisture content. The fluorocarbon compounds flowed with the bulk fluid when the sand was damp, but were significantly retained by the solid phase when the sand was thoroughly dried. The data suggest that the fluorocarbons may be conservative tracers in geothermal conditions up to mild superheat but they may not be conservative at geothermal conditions with a high degree of superheat.","","","Idaho National Lab.

A variety of subsurface thermo-physical-chemical processes are considered under a wide range of conditions of pressure, temperature, water saturation, ionic strength, and pH and Eh. Interactions between mineral assemblages and fluids can occur under local equilibrium or kinetic rates. The gas phase can be chemically active. Precipitation and dissolution reactions can change formation porosity and permeability. The program can be applied to many geologic systems and environmental problems, including geothermal systems, diagenetic and weathering processes, subsurface waste disposal, acid mine drainage remediation, contaminant transport, and groundwater quality.

Use of currently available correlations often yields widely differing results for geothermal wells. A new liquid holdup correlation is devised for cased wellbores using high-quality discharge and downhold pressure and temperature data from flowing geothermal wells. The latter dataset encompasses a wide range of wellbore diameters, discharge rates and flowing enthalpies. The measured wellhead pressure for wells in the dataset display excellent agreement with the pressures computed by using the new holdup correlation. Finally, an example illustrating the use of the holdup correlation to match downhole pressure and temperature profiles and well characteristic data is given.","","","Idaho National Lab.

They are indispensable tools for managing groundwater resources, analyzing proposed and actual remediation activities at contaminated sites, optimizing recovery of oil, gas, and geothermal energy, evaluating subsurface structures and mining activities, designing monitoring systems, assessing the long-term impacts of chemical and nuclear waste disposal, and devising improved irrigation and drainage practices in agricultural areas, among many other applications. The complexity of subsurface hydrology in the vadose zone calls for sophisticated modeling codes capable of handling the strong nonlinearities involved, the interactions of coupled physical, chemical and biological processes, and the multiscale heterogeneities inherent in such systems. The papers in this special section of ''Vadose Zone Journal'' are illustrative of the enormous potential of such numerical simulators as applied to the vadose zone. The papers describe recent developments and applications of one particular set of codes, the TOUGH family of codes, as applied to nonisothermal flow and transport in heterogeneous porous and fractured media (http://www-esd.lbl.gov/TOUGH2). The contributions were selected from presentations given at the TOUGH Symposium 2003, which brought together developers and users of the TOUGH codes at the Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory (LBNL) in Berkeley, California, for three days of information exchange in May 2003 (http://www-esd.lbl.gov/TOUGHsymposium). The papers presented at the symposium covered a wide range of topics, including geothermal reservoir engineering, fracture flow and vadose zone hydrology, nuclear waste disposal, mining engineering, reactive chemical transport, environmental remediation, and gas transport. This Special Section of ''Vadose Zone Journal'' contains revised and expanded versions of selected papers from the symposium, with special attention to issues related to the vadose zone and unsaturated flow systems. The first paper, written by the original developer of TOUGH, Karsten Pruess, provides an overview of the history of the TOUGH codes, the main physical processes considered, their mathematical and numerical implementation, and case studies. That paper is followed by a review article summarizing inverse modeling applications performed by iTOUGH2. A subsequent group of papers deals with diverse unsaturated zone systems, highlighting the versatility of the code to handle a variety of processes in different geologic settings. Simulation capabilities of the TOUGH codes are increasingly used for geologic carbon sequestration studies as testified by the next group of papers. The final series of papers demonstrates the use of the TOUGH codes in support of remediation and engineering applications. These studies discuss biological and reactive chemical transport simulations, the design of clean-up operations and landfill management, and the analysis of engineered soil stabilization. As guest editors, we thank the authors for their interesting contributions, and the many reviewers for their careful and constructive review comments. Finally, on behalf of all of the authors and ourselves, we express our sincerest appreciation to Rien van Genuchten for providing the opportunity to publish these papers together in a Special Section of ''Vadose Zone Journal''.","","","Lawrence Berkeley National Lab.

Thermus strains SA-01 and NMX2 A.1 have also been shown previously to grow using nitrate, Fe(III), , Mn(IV) or So as terminal electron acceptors and to be capable of reducing Cr(VI), U(VI), Co(III), and the quinine-containing compound anthraquinone-2,6-disulfonate. The objectives of this study were to determine the phylogenetic positions of the three known metal-reducing Thermus strains and to determine the phylogenetic significance of metal reduction within the genus Thermus. Phylogenetic analyses of 16S rDNA sequences, BOX PCR genomic fingerprinting, and DNA-DNA reassociation analyses indicated that these strains belong to the previously described genospecies T. scotoductus. The morphologies and lipid fatty acid profiles of these metal-reducing strains are consistent with their identification as T. scotoductus; however, the T. scotoductus strains tested in this study evinced a wide intraspecies variability in some other phenotypic traits, e.g., carbon substrate utilization and pigmentation. Iron reduction occurred in all strains of T. scotoductus tested except the mixotrophic, sulfur-oxidizing strain IT-7254. Thermus strains belonging to other species did not reduce Fe(III) to Fe(II) or reduced it only poorly.","","","Pacific Northwest National Lab.

The Endeavour segment is devoid of overlying sediments and has shown no observable signs of surficial magmatic activity during the {approx}20 years of ongoing studies. The appearance of isotopically heavy, radiocarbon dead CO{sub 2} after a 1999 earthquake swarm requires that this earthquake event was magmatic in origin. Evidence for a sedimentary organic carbon source suggests the presence of buried sediments at the ridge axis. These findings, which represent the first temporally coherent set of radiocarbon measurements from hydrothermal vent fluids, demonstrate the utility of radiocarbon analysis in hydrothermal studies. The existence of a sediment source at Endeavour and the occurrence of magmatic episodes illustrate the extremely complex and evolving nature of the Endeavour hydrothermal system.","","","Lawrence Livermore National Lab.

Previous studies of the Yellowstone geothermal system have characterized water-rock interaction through analysis of rocks and fluids obtained from both surface and downhole samples. Fluid chemistry, rock mineralogy, permeability, porosity, and thermal data obtained from the Y-8 borehole in Upper Geyser Basin were used to constrain a series of reactive transport simulations of the Yellowstone geothermal system using TOUGHREACT. Three distinct stratigraphic units were encountered in the 153.4 m deep Y-8 drill core: volcaniclastic sandstone, perlitic rhyolitic lava, and nonwelded pumiceous tuff. The main alteration phases identified in the Y-8 core samples include clay minerals, zeolites, silica polymorphs, adularia, and calcite. Temperatures observed in the Y-8 borehole increase with depth from sub-boiling conditions at the surface to a maximum of 169.8 C at a depth of 104.1 m, with near-isothermal conditions persisting down to the well bottom. 1-D models of the Y-8 core hole were constructed to simulate the observed alteration mineral assemblage given the initial rock mineralogy and observed fluid chemistry and temperatures. Preliminary simulations involving the perlitic rhyolitic lava unit are consistent with the observed alteration of rhyolitic glass to form celadonite.","","OSTI as DE00834970","Lawrence Berkeley National Lab.

"Reactive geothermal transport simulation to study the formation mechanism of impermeable barrier between acidic and neutral fluid zones in the Onikobe geothermal field, Japan","Todaka, Noritumi; Akasaka, Chitosi; Xu, Tianfu; Pruess, Karsten","15 GEOTHERMAL ENERGY; CALCITE; EXPLORATION; FRACTURES; GALENA; HYDROTHERMAL SYSTEMS; MAGMA; ONIKOBE GEOTHERMAL FIELD; PERMEABILITY; POROSITY; PRECIPITATION; PYRITE; QUARTZ; SMECTITE; SULFIDE MINERALS; UPWELLING","Two types of fluids are encountered in the Onikobe geothermal reservoir (Japan): One is neutral and the other is acidic. It is hypothesized that acidic fluid might be upwelling along a fault zone from magma and that an impermeable barrier might be present between the acidic and neutral fluid zones. To test such a conceptual model and to study the geochemical behavior due to mixing of the two fluids, reactive geothermal transport simulations under both natural and production conditions were carried out using the code TOUGHREACT. Results indicate Mn-rich smectite precipitates near the mixing front. Precipitation of sphalerite and galena occurs in a similar region as the Mn-rich smectite. Precipitation of these minerals depends on pH and temperature. In addition, quartz, pyrite, and calcite precipitate in the shallow zone resulting in further development of caprock. The changes in porosity and permeability due to precipitation of Mn-rich smectite are small compared with that of quartz, calcite, and pyrite. However, the smectite precipitation is likely to fill open fractures and to form an impermeable barrier between acidic and neutral fluid regions. The simulated mineral assemblage is generally consistent with observations in the Onikobe field. The numerical simulations described here provide useful insight into geochemical behavior and formation of impermeable barriers from fluid mixing. The method presented in this paper may be useful in fundamental analysis of hydrothermal systems and in the exploration of geothermal reservoirs, including chemical evolution, mineral alteration, mineral scaling, and changes in porosity and permeability.","","","Lawrence Berkeley National Lab.

We are imaging several large areas in the western US with high resolution airborne hyperspectral and satellite multispectral sensors. We have now entered the phase where the remote sensing techniques and tools we are developing are mature enough to be combined with other geothermal exploration techniques such as aeromagnetic, seismic, well logging and coring data. The imaging sensors and analysis techniques we have developed have the ability to map visible faults, surface effluents, altered minerals, subtle hidden faults. Large regions are being imaged at reasonable costs. The technique of geobotanical remote sensing for geothermal signatures is based on recent successes in mapping hidden faults, high temperature altered mineralization, clays, hot and cold springs and CO2 effluents the Long Valley Caldera and Mammoth Mountain in California. The areas that have been imaged include Mammoth Mountain and the Long Valley Caldera, Dixie Meadows NV, Fish Lake Valley NV, and Brady Hot Springs.

Porosity and matrix permeability measurements and petrographic examination of the cores were used to evaluate the effects of lithology and hydrothermal alteration on porosity and permeability. The intervals studied in these two core holes span the conductive zone and the upper portion of the convective geothermal reservoir. Variations in porosity and matrix permeability observed in the Y-5 and Y-8 cores are primarily controlled by lithology. Y-8 intersects three distinct lithologies: volcaniclastic sandstone, perlitic rhyolitic lava, and nonwelded pumiceous ash-flow tuff. The sandstone typically has high permeability and porosity, and the tuff has very high porosity and moderate permeability, while the perlitic lava has very low porosity and is essentially impermeable. Hydrothermal self-sealing appears to have generated localized permeability barriers within the reservoir. Changes in pressure and temperature in Y-8 correspond to a zone of silicification in the volcaniclastic sandstone just above the contact with the perlitic rhyolite; this silicification has significantly reduced porosity and permeability. In rocks with inherently low matrix permeability (such as densely welded ash-flow tuff), fluid flow is controlled by the fracture network. The Y-5 core hole penetrates a thick intracaldera section of the0.6 Ma Lava Creek ash-flow tuff. In this core, the degree of welding appears to be responsible for most of the variations in porosity, matrix permeability, and the frequency of fractures and veins. Fractures are most abundant within the more densely welded sections of the tuff. However, the most prominent zones of fracturing and mineralization are associated with hydrothermal breccias within densely welded portions of the tuff. These breccia zones represent transient conduits of high fluid flow that formed by the explosive release of overpressure in the underlying geothermal reservoir and that were subsequently sealed by supersaturated geothermal fluids. In addition to this fracture sealing, hydrothermal alteration at Yellowstone appears generally to reduce matrix permeability and focus flow along fractures, where multiple pulses of fluid flow and self-sealing have occurred.","","","Lawrence Berkeley National Lab.

The following scenarios of parental geothermal fluid upflow were studied: (1) single-phase conditions, 260 C at the bottom ( Ogiri type); (2) two-phase conditions, 300 C at the bottom ( Hatchobaru type); and (3) heat pipe conditions, 260 C at the bottom ( Matsukawa type). THC modeling for the single-phase upflow scenario shows wairakite, quartz, K-feld spar and chlorite formed as the principal secondary minerals in the production zone, and illite-smectite formed below 230 C. THC modeling of the two-phase upflow shows that quartz, K-feldspar (microcline), wairakite and calcite precipitate in the model as principal secondary minerals in the production zone. THC modeling of heat pipe conditions shows no significant secondary deposition of minerals (quartz, K-feldspar, zeolites) in the production zone. The influence of thermodynamic and kinetic parameters of chemical interaction, and of mass fluxes on mineral phase changes, was found to be significant, depending on the upflow regime. It was found that no parental geothermal fluid inflow is needed for zeolite precipitation, which occurs above 140 C in saturated andesite, provided that the porosity is greater than 0.001. In contrast, quartz and K-feldspar precipitation may result in a significant porosity reduction over a hundred-year time scale under mass flux conditions, and complete fracture sealing will occur given sufficient time under either single-phase or two-phase upflow scenarios. A heat pipe scenario shows no significant porosity reduction due to lack of secondary mineral phase deposition.","","","Lawrence Berkeley National Lab.

"Revisiting the 'Buy versus Build' Decision for Publicly Owned Utilities in California Considering Wind and Geothermal Resources","Bolinger, Mark; Wiser, Ryan; Golove, William","15 GEOTHERMAL ENERGY; 17 WIND ENERGY; 29 ENERGY PLANNING, POLICY AND ECONOMY; AVAILABILITY; CAPACITY; COMPETITION; DEPRECIATION; ECONOMIC ANALYSIS; ECONOMICS; ELECTRIC UTILITIES; ELECTRICITY; GEOTHERMAL RESOURCES; MARKET; OWNERSHIP; PRODUCTION; SCHEDULES; TAX CREDITS; Geothermal Legacy","The last two decades have seen a dramatic increase in the market share of independent, nonutility generators (NUGs) relative to traditional, utility-owned generation assets. Accordingly, the ''buy versus build'' decision facing utilities--i.e., whether a utility should sign a power purchase agreement (PPA) with a NUG, or develop and own the generation capacity itself--has gained prominence in the industry. Very little of this debate, however, has focused specifically on publicly owned electric utilities, and with few exceptions, renewable sources of supply have received similarly scant attention. Contrary to historical treatment, however, the buy versus build debate is quite relevant to publicly owned utilities and renewables because publicly owned utilities are able to take advantage of some renewable energy incentives only in a ''buy'' situation, while others accrue only in a ''build'' situation. In particular, possible economic advantages of public utility ownership include: (1) the tax-free status of publicly owned utilities and the availability of low-cost debt, and (2) the renewable energy production incentive (REPI) available only to publicly owned utilities. Possible economic advantages to entering into a PPA with a NUG include: (1) the availability of federal tax credits and accelerated depreciation schedules for certain forms of NUG-owned renewable energy, and (2) the California state production incentives available to NUGs but not utilities. This article looks at a publicly owned utility's decision to buy or build new renewable energy capacity--specifically wind and geothermal power--in California. To examine the economic aspects of this decision, we used a 20-year financial cash-flow model to assess the levelized cost of electricity under four supply options: (1) public utility ownership of new geothermal capacity, (2) public utility ownership of new wind capacity, (3) a PPA for new geothermal capacity, and (4) a PPA for new wind capacity. We focus on wind and geothermal because both resources are abundant and, in some cases, potentially economic in California. Our analysis is not intended to provide precise estimates of the levelized cost of electricity from wind projects and geothermal plants; nor is our intent to compare the levelized costs of wind and geothermal power to one another. Instead, our intent is simply to compare the costs of buying wind or geothermal power to the costs of building and operating wind or geothermal capacity under various scenarios. Of course, the ultimate decision to buy or build cannot and should not rest solely on a comparison of the levelized cost of electricity. Thus, in addition to quantitative analysis, we also include a qualitative discussion of several important features of the ''buy versus build'' decision not reflected in the economic analysis.","","OSTI as DE00836793","Lawrence Berkeley National Lab.

"A Reaction-Transport Model for Calcite Precipitation andEvaluation of Infiltration Fluxes in unsaturated fractured rock","Xu, Tianfu; Sonnenthal, Eric; Bodvarsson, Gudmundur","12 MANAGEMENT OF RADIOACTIVE WASTES, AND NON-RADIOACTIVE WASTES FROM NUCLEAR FACILITIES; 15 GEOTHERMAL ENERGY; BOREHOLES; CALCITE; CAVITIES; DEPOSITION; FRACTURES; GEOTHERMAL GRADIENTS; MODIFICATIONS; PRECIPITATION; SIMULATION; SITE CHARACTERIZATION; TRANSPORT; TUFF; US GS; YUCCA MOUNTAIN","The percolation flux in the unsaturated zone (UZ) is an important parameter addressed in site characterization and flow and transport modeling of the potential nuclear-waste repository at Yucca Mountain, NV, USA. The US Geological Survey (USGS) has documented hydrogenic calcite abundances in fractures and lithophysal cavities at Yucca Mountain to provide constraints on percolation fluxes in the UZ. The purpose of this study was to investigate the relationship between percolation flux and measured calcite abundances using reactive transport modeling. Our model considers the following essential factors affecting calcite precipitation: (1) infiltration, (2) the ambient geothermal gradient, (3) gaseous CO2 diffusive transport and partitioning in liquid and gas phases, (4) fracture matrix interaction for water flow and chemical constituents, and (5) water rock interaction. Over a bounding range of 2 20 mm/year infiltration rate, the simulated calcite distributions capture the trend in calcite abundances measured in a deep borehole (WT-24) by the USGS. The calcite is found predominantly in fractures in the welded tuffs, which is also captured by the model simulations. Simulations showed that from about 2 to 6 mm/year, the amount of calcite precipitated in the welded Topopah Spring tuff is sensitive to the infiltration rate. This dependence decreases at higher infiltration rates owing to a modification of the geothermal gradient from the increased percolation flux. The model also confirms the conceptual model for higher percolation fluxes in the fractures compared to the matrix in the welded units, and the significant contribution of Ca from water rock interaction. This study indicates that reactive transport modeling of calcite deposition can yield important constraints on the unsaturated zone infiltration-percolation flux and provide useful insight into processes such as fracture matrix interaction as well as conditions and parameters controlling calcite deposition.","","","Lawrence Berkeley National Lab.

For the evaluation of the possibilities in the energy system of Germany, the available potentials are one of the most important criteria. Within this context, in the past only the available resources and the reserves have been discussed. But these data have hardly practical relevance for the energy-political and energy-economic discussions, since they do not consider the conditions in the corresponding energy system. In this article, therefore, explanations additional to the overall existing amount of heat in underground portions are shown, which could be used also from a technical point of view. In addition, the demand-side restrictions are considered and the share of the available heat is pointed out which can be used within the energy system of Germany. The explanations show that consideration of the demand side is necessary to make relevant statements. The investigations also make clear that terrestrial heat will never be able to cover more than just a part of the energy demand for warmth in Germany.","","","Univ. of Stuttgart (DE)","","","United States","2000-06-01T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: Energy Sources; Journal Volume: 22; Journal Issue: 5; Other Information: PBD: Jun 2000","","Medium: X; Size: page(s) 417-430","","","","Journal ID: ISSN 0090-8312; EGYSAO; TRN: IM200031%%182","","","2010-06-03T00:00:00Z","20076053","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/20076053","","Energy Sources","5","22"

These precipitates formed from spring water that has a temperature of &gt;90 C and a pH of 8.1--8.8. The opaline silica is restricted to areas around the vent where cooling and evaporation of the spring water triggered precipitation. The calcite deposits in the spring vent and on the discharge apron are formed of large (up to 15 cm long) asymmetrical dendrite crystals that are characterized by multiple levels of branching. Branches grew preferentially from the downflow side of their parent branch. All branches have a trigonal transverse cross section except in areas where competition for growth space induced merger of neighboring crystals. The primary branches of the dendrite crystals are (sub)perpendicular to the substrate even in areas where the discharge apron slopes at a high angle (up to 80{degree}). On the steeper parts of the discharge apron, the plate-like primary branches form the floors of the small terrace pools whereas their distal edges form the rims of the pools. Growth of these dendrite crystals is attributed to abiotic processes. High levels of saturation with respect to calcite were caused by rapid CO{sub 2} degassing of the sheets of spring water that flowed down the steep discharge apron. Calcite crystals with different crystal morphologies characterize other springs near this spring. The variation in crystal morphologies from spring to spring is attributed to different levels of saturation that are related to the initial PCO{sub 2} of the spring water upon discharge and the rate of CO{sub 2} degassing at each spring.","","","Univ. of Alberta, Edmonton, Alberta (CA)","","","United States","2000-05-01T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: Journal of Sedimentary Research, Section A: Sedimentary Petrology and Processes; Journal Volume: 70; Journal Issue: 3; Other Information: PBD: May 2000","","Medium: X; Size: page(s) 586-603","","","","Journal ID: ISSN 1073-130X; JSRAEA; TRN: IM200031%%189","10.1306/2DC4092A-0E47-11D7-8643000102C1865D","","2016-04-26T00:00:00Z","20076060","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/20076060","","Journal of Sedimentary Research, Section A: Sedimentary Petrology and Processes","3","70"

Spring waters are expelled in the vent facies at 71 to 73 C and precipitate mounded travertine composed of aragonite needle botryoids. The apron and channel facies (43--72 C) is floored by hollow tubes composed of aragonite needle botryoids that encrust sulfide-oxidizing Aquificales bacteria. The travertine of the pond facies (30--62 C) varies in composition from aragonite needle shrubs formed at higher temperatures to ridged networks of calcite and aragonite at lower temperatures. Calcite ice sheets, calcified bubbles, and aggregates of aragonite needles (fuzzy dumbbells) precipitate at the air-water interface and settle to pond floors. The proximal-slope facies (28--54 C), which forms the margins of terracette pools, is composed of arcuate aragonite needle shrubs that create small microterracettes on the steep slope face. Finally, the distal-slope facies (28--30 C) is composed of calcite spherules and calcite feather crystals. Despite the presence of abundant microbial mat communities and their observed role in providing substrates for mineralization, the compositions of spring-water and travertine predominantly reflect abiotic physical and chemical processes. Vigorous CO{sub 2} degassing causes a +2 unit increase in spring water pH, as well as Rayleigh-type covariations between the concentration of dissolved inorganic carbon and corresponding {delta}{sup 13}C. Travertine {delta}{sup 13}C and {delta}{sup 18}O are nearly equivalent to aragonite and calcite equilibrium values calculated from spring water in the higher-temperature ({approximately}50--73 C) depositional facies. Conversely, travertine precipitating in the lower-temperature (&lt;{approximately}50 C) depositional facies exhibits {delta}{sup 13}C and {delta}{sup 18}O values that are as much as 4% less than predicted equilibrium values. This isotopic shift may record microbial respiration as well as downstream transport of travertine crystals. Despite the production of H{sub 2}S and the abundance of sulfide-oxidizing microbes, preliminary {delta}{sub 34}S data do not uniquely define the microbial metabolic pathways present in the spring system. This suggests that the high extent of CO{sub 2} degassing and large open-system solute reservoir in these thermal systems overwhelm biological controls on travertine crystal chemistry.","","","Univ. of Illinois, Urbana, IL (US)","","","United States","2000-05-01T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: Journal of Sedimentary Research, Section A: Sedimentary Petrology and Processes; Journal Volume: 70; Journal Issue: 3; Other Information: PBD: May 2000","","Medium: X; Size: page(s) 565-585","","","","Journal ID: ISSN 1073-130X; JSRAEA; TRN: IM200031%%188","","","2010-06-03T00:00:00Z","20076059","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/20076059","","Journal of Sedimentary Research, Section A: Sedimentary Petrology and Processes","3","70"

The X-ray reflectivity data, taken over a momentum transfer range of 6 {angstrom}{sup {minus}1}, indicate that the calcite surface does not vary significantly over this range of experimental conditions. From an analysis of the data at pH 8.3, the best-fit reflectivity model requires the presence of 1.0 {+-} 0.4 monolayer of a hydroxyl species (OH or OH{sub 2}) at 2.50 {+-} 0.12 {angstrom} above the surface Ca ions and involves rotations of the surface carbonate groups toward the (104) plane. The X-ray reflectivity data for pH 6.8 and 12.1 can be explained without involving changes other than protonation reactions in the surface speciation of terrace areas. This is consistent with scanning force microscopy studies of calcite growth and dissolution near equilibrium, which show that attachment and detachment of Ca and CO{sub 3} ions occurs primarily at step-edge kink sites. These results demonstrate how high-resolution X-ray reflectivity can be used for direct, in situ measurement of mineral surface structure, to provide strong constraints on chemical speciation and reactivity at the mineral-fluid interface.","","","Argonne National Lab., IL (US)","USDOE","","United States","2000-04-01T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: Geochimica et Cosmochimica Acta; Journal Volume: 64; Journal Issue: 7; Other Information: PBD: Apr 2000","","Medium: X; Size: page(s) 1221-1228","","","AC06-76RL01830; FG03-99ER45776; W-31109-ENG-38; AC02-98CH10886","Journal ID: ISSN 0016-7037; GCACAK; TRN: IM200019%%311","10.1016/S0016-7037(99)00403-2","","2010-06-03T00:00:00Z","20020886","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/20020886","","Geochimica et Cosmochimica Acta","7","64"

The calcite crystals were preannealed and H{sub 2}O was excluded from the system to determine the self-diffusion coefficients. The CO{sub 2} consisted of 99% {sup 13}C and 90% {sup 18}O. After heating for 7--147 d, diffusion profiles were measured with the use of secondary ion mass spectrometry. The results indicate that the diffusivity of C is D{sub c} = 7.77 x 10{sup {minus}9} exp ({minus}166 {+-} 16 kJ/mol/RT) cm{sup 2}/s and of O is D{sub o} = 7.5 x 10{sup {minus}3} exp ({minus}242 {+-} 39 kJ/mol/RT)cm{sup 2}/s. In comparison with other determinations of diffusivities in calcite, diffusion of O under the experimental conditions is consistent with vacancy migration in the intrinsic region, and diffusion of C seems to occur by diffusion of carbonate anions. Increased pressure appears to reduce the activation energy and the value of D{sub 0}, and the presence of H{sub 2}O greatly increases the diffusivity of O without appreciably changing the activation energy. Closure temperatures calculated for isotopic exchange by diffusion predict that C isotope compositions of calcite are preserved during cooling in most geologic environments, but that O isotope compositions in H{sub 2}O-rich environments are preserved only in rapidly cooling environments, such as contact metamorphic aureoles.","","","Univ. of Tennessee, Knoxville, TN (US)","USDOE","","United States","2000-04-01T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: American Mineralogist; Journal Volume: 85; Journal Issue: 3-4; Other Information: PBD: Mar-Apr 2000","","Medium: X; Size: page(s) 488-494","","","AC05-96OR22464","Journal ID: ISSN 0003-004X; AMMIAY; TRN: IM200019%%315","10.2138/am-2000-0410","","2016-04-19T00:00:00Z","20020890","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/20020890","","American Mineralogist","3-4","85"

In many cases, this behavior can be modeled adequately by a simple pseudo-first order rate model that accounts for changes in surface area of the solid. Previous modeling of high temperature isotope exchange data for carbonates, sulfates, and silicates indicated that within a given mineral group there appears to be a systematic relationship between rate and mineral chemistry. The author tested this idea by conducting oxygen isotope exchange experiments in the systems, carbonate-H{sub 2}O and layer silicate-H{sub 2}O at 300 and 350 C, respectively. Witherite (BaCO{sub 3}), strontianite (SrCO{sub 3}) and calcite (CaCO{sub 3}) were reacted with pure H{sub 2}O for different lengths of time (271--1,390 H) at 300 C and 100 bars. The layer silicates, chlorite, biotite and muscovite were reacted with H{sub 2}O for durations ranging from 132 to 3,282 h at 350 C and 250 bars.

The Nd isotopic results evidence a common pattern of REE concentration from igneous sources despite large differences in age (Proterozoic to Tertiary), tectonic setting (subduction vs. intraplate), and magmatic style (mafic vs. felsic). In the Middle Proterozoic St. Francois Mountains terrane of southeastern Missouri, {epsilon}{sub Nd} for Fe-P-REE (apatite, monazite, xenotime) deposits ranges from +3.5 to +5.1, similar to associated felsic to intermediate igneous rocks of the same age ({epsilon}{sub Nd} = +2.6 to +6.2). At the mid-Jurassic Humboldt mafic complex in western Nevada, {epsilon}{sub Nd} for Fe-P-REE (apatite) mineralization varies between +1.1 and +2.4, similar to associated mafic igneous rocks ({minus}1.0 to +3.5). In the nearby Cortez Mountains in central Nevada, mid-Jurassic felsic volcanic and plutonic rocks ({epsilon}{sub Nd} = {minus}2.0 to {minus}4.4) are associated with Fe-P-REE (apatite-monazite) mineralization having similar {epsilon}{sub Nd}({minus}1.7 to {minus}2.4). At Cerro de Mercado, Durango, Mexico, all assemblages analyzed in this Tertiary rhyolite-hosted Fe oxide deposit have identical isotopic compositions with {epsilon}{sub Nd} = {minus}2.5. These data are consistent with coeval igneous host rocks being the primary source of REE in all four regions, and are inconsistent with a significant contribution of REE from other sources. Interpretations of the origin of these hydrothermal systems and their concomitant REE mobility must account for nonspecialized igneous sources and varied tectonic settings.","","","Univ. of Arizona, Tucson, AZ (US)","","","United States","2000-03-01T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: Geochimica et Cosmochimica Acta; Journal Volume: 64; Journal Issue: 6; Other Information: PBD: Mar 2000","","Medium: X; Size: page(s) 1059-1068","","","","Journal ID: ISSN 0016-7037; GCACAK; TRN: IM200019%%303","10.1016/S0016-7037(99)00325-7","","2010-06-03T00:00:00Z","20020878","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/20020878","","Geochimica et Cosmochimica Acta","6","64"

"Dissolved and particulate Fe in a hydrothermal plume at 9{degree}45 minutes N, East Pacific Rise: Slow Fe (II) oxidation kinetics in Pacific plumes","Field, M P; Sherrell, R M","15 GEOTHERMAL ENERGY; 54 ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCES; HYDROTHERMAL SYSTEMS; PACIFIC OCEAN; IRON; SOLUBILITY; OXIDATION; REDOX REACTIONS; OCEANIC CIRCULATION; BIOGEOCHEMISTRY","Production of Fe(III) particles in hydrothermal plumes is of fundamental importance to the long-term effect of hydrothermal circulation on seawater composition. To elucidate the fundamental controls on Fe redox kinetics and solution/particle partitioning in neutrally buoyant plumes, the authors sampled near-field (&lt;3 km) plume particles at 9{degree}45 minutes N on the East Pacific Rise in 1996, returning in 1997 to sample both particulate and dissolved phases (0.40 {micro}m filter). Concentrations of dissolved Fe varied from 320 to 20 nM in proximal (&lt;0.3 km from vent site) to distal samples (1--3 km downfield), constituting {approximately}85--50% of total Fe, respectively. Based on vent fluid dilution factors calculated from dissolved Mn, a mass balance for vent fluid Fe at this site indicates that {approximately}65% of Fe is lost to particulate sulfide settling in the buoyant plume, and that particulate Fe in distal (1--3 km) samples is twice as concentrated as predicted from dilution of particles in proximal plume water. These observations are consistent with a calculated Fe(II) oxidation half-time of 3.3 h, long enough that Fe(III) colloid production and aggregation occurs primarily in the neutrally buoyant plume at relatively high dilutions, preventing generation of high particular Fe concentrations (11--56 nM observed). A general investigation of Fe(II) oxidation rates in plumes worldwide gives Fe(II) oxidation half-lives as short as 17 min at some Atlantic sites, and as long as 6 h at some Pacific sites. The calculations indicate that the distribution of Fe particles in plumes depends chiefly on inter-basin differences in ambient deep water chemistry (primarily pH and dissolved O{sub 2}) and on local currents driving plume dilution, and to a much lesser extent on variations in primary vent fluid composition. Long-term changes in thermohaline circulation or ocean biogeochemistry may therefore alter Fe dynamics and minor element fluxes associated with global hydrothermal activity, independent of variations in crustal production rates.","","","Rutgers Univ., New Brunswick, NJ (US)","","","United States","2000-02-01T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: Geochimica et Cosmochimica Acta; Journal Volume: 64; Journal Issue: 4; Other Information: PBD: Feb 2000","","Medium: X; Size: page(s) 619-628","","","","Journal ID: ISSN 0016-7037; GCACAK; TRN: IM200017%%166","10.1016/S0016-7037(99)00333-6","","2010-06-03T00:00:00Z","20017444","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/20017444","","Geochimica et Cosmochimica Acta","4","64"

The authors have sampled these spring waters from a manned submersible, along with associated sediment pore waters from 48 gravity and piston cores. Systematic variations in the chemical composition of these waters indicate that hydrothermal reactions in basement at moderate temperatures remove Na, K, Li, Rb, Mg, TCO{sub 2}, alkalinity, and phosphate from the circulating seawater and leach Ca, Sr, Si, B, and Mn from the oceanic crust; and that reactions with the turbidite sediment surrounding Baby Bare remove Na, Li, Mg, Ca, Sr, and sulfate from the pore water while producing ammonium and Si and both producing and consuming phosphate, nitrate, alkalinity, Mn, and Fe. K, Rb, and B are relatively unreactive in the sediment column. The composition of altered seawater in basement at Baby Bare is similar to the inferred composition of 58 C formation water from crust nearly twice as old (5.9 Ma) on the southern flank of the Costa Rica Rift. The Baby Bare fluids also exhibit the same directions of net elemental transfer between basalt and seawater as solutions produced in laboratory experiments at a similar temperature, and complement compositional changes form seawater observed in seafloor basalts altered at cool to moderate temperatures. The common parameter among the two ridge flanks and experiments is temperature, suggesting that the residence time of seawater in the two ridge-flank sites is sufficiently long for the solutions to equilibrate with altered basalt. The authors use the Baby Bare spring water to estimate upper limits on the global fluxes of 14 elements at warm ridge-flank sites such as Baby Bare. Maximum calculated fluxes of Mg, Ca, sulfate, B, and K may equal or exceed 25% of the riverine flux, and such sites may represent the missing, high K/Rb sink required for the K budget.","","","Univ. of Alaska, Fairbanks, AK (US)","","","United States","2000-02-01T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: Geochimica et Cosmochimica Acta; Journal Volume: 64; Journal Issue: 4; Other Information: PBD: Feb 2000","","Medium: X; Size: page(s) 629-642","","","","Journal ID: ISSN 0016-7037; GCACAK; TRN: IM200017%%167","10.1016/S0016-7037(99)00347-6","","2010-06-03T00:00:00Z","20017445","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/20017445","","Geochimica et Cosmochimica Acta","4","64"
"U, Ra and Ba incorporation during precipitation of hydrothermal carbonates: Implications for {sup 226}Ra-Ba dating of impure travertines","Rihs, S; Condomines, M; Sigmarsson, O","15 GEOTHERMAL ENERGY; HYDROTHERMAL SYSTEMS; CALCITE; URANIUM; RADIUM; BARIUM; PRECIPITATION; ISOTOPE DATING; CARBONATE MINERALS","The authors studied U, Ra and Ba incorporation in calcite in a natural CO{sub 2}-rich hydrothermal area from the French Massif Central. Along the western border of the Limagne graben, several springs are exploited for the petrification of various artifacts with calcite. These sites offer the opportunity to sample the water and the calcite layers downflow from the spring, and thus to follow the evolution of their U, Ra and Ba contents as precipitation proceeds. Results show that the apparent partition coefficients of U, Ra and Ba between water and calcite decrease during precipitation for the three elements. The authors found no direct relation between this variation and the main factors able to influence the partition coefficient, such as precipitation rate, which suggests that the incorporation of these trace elements could result from a composite process of adsorption and coprecipitation. Ra and Ba have a similar behavior, with an apparent partition coefficient decreasing from 0.80 to 0.47 for Ra and 0.96 to 0.68 for Ba, resulting in a small ({le}10%) variation of the Ra/Ba ratio. The apparent partition coefficient of U decreases from 0.38 to 0.20. These apparent coefficients are much higher than equilibrium values but might be applicable to natural systems with high precipitation rates. The authors also investigated the possibility of using the decay of the {sup 226}Ra-excess, or the decrease of the ({sup 226}Ra)/Ba ratio to date older deposits. Whereas the {sup 226}Ra initial activity at the time of deposition has not remained constant, and cannot be used for dating, the ({sup 226}Ra)/Ba method gives better results, when appropriate corrections for detrital contamination in Ba are made. Mixing diagrams using Th as an indicator of contamination allow calculation of the ({sup 226}Ra)/Ba ratio of the pure carbonate component. The calculated ages of five travertine layers range from 330 to 800 years, suggesting a mean deposition rate of about 1 cm/yr. The relatively good agreement of the calculated ages and stratigraphic positions of the samples suggest that this method could be successfully applied to date impure hydrothermal carbonates in the range 0--10 ky.","","","Univ.

The Geysers geothermal region was rapidly developed as a site of geothermal power production. The likelihood that this could cause significant strain within the reservoir, with corresponding surface displacements, led to a series of deformation monitoring surveys. In 1973, 1975, 1977, and 1980, The Geysers region was surveyed using first-order, class I, spirit leveling. In 1994, 1995, and 1996, many of the leveling control monuments were resurveyed using high-precision Global Positioning System receivers. The two survey methods are reconciled using the GEOID96 geoid model. The displacements are inverted to determine volume strain within the reservoir. For the period 1980-1994, peak volume strains in excess of 5x10{sup -4} are imaged. There is an excellent correlation between the observed changes in reservoir steam pressures and the imaged volume strain. If reservoir pressure changes are inducing volume strain, then the reservoir quasi-static bulk modulus K must be &lt;4.6x10{sup 9} Pa. However, seismic velocities indicate a much stiffer reservoir with K=3.4x10{sup 10} Pa. This apparent discrepancy is shown to be consistent with predicted frequency dependence in K for fractured and water-saturated rock. Inversion of surface deformation data therefore appears to be a powerful method for imaging pressure change within the body of the reservoir. Correlation between induced seismicity at The Geysers and volume strain is observed. However, earthquake distribution does not appear to have a simple relationship with volume strain rate.

A 15-station network of digital, three-component seismic stations was operated for one month in 1991, and 3,900 earthquakes were recorded. Highly-accurate moment tensors were derived for 30 of the best recorded earthquakes by tracing rays through tomographically derived 3-D V{sub p} and V{sub p}/V{sub s} structures, and inverting P- and S-wave polarities and amplitude ratios. The orientations of the P- and T-axes are very scattered, suggesting that there is not strong, systematic deviatoric stress field in the reservoir, which could explain why the earthquakes are not large. Most of the events had significant non-double-couple (non-DC) components in their source mechanisms with volumetric components up to {approximately}30% of the total moment. Explosive and implosive sources were observed in approximately equal numbers, and must be caused by cavity creation (or expansion) and collapse. It is likely that there is a causal relationship between these processes and fluid reinjection and steam withdrawal. Compensated linear vector dipole (CLVD) components were up to 100% of the deviatoric component. Combinations of opening cracks and shear faults cannot explain all the observations, and rapid fluid flow may also be involved. The pattern of non-DC failure at The Geysers contrasts with that of the Hengill-Grensdalur area in Iceland, a largely unexploited water-dominated field in an extensional stress regime. These differences are poorly understood but may be linked to the contrasting regional stress regimes and the industrial exploitation at The Geysers.","","","Amoco, London (GB)","","","United States","1999-12-01T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: Geophysics; Journal Volume: 64; Journal Issue: 6; Other Information: PBD: Nov-Dec 1999","","Medium: X; Size: page(s) 1877-1889","","","","Journal ID: ISSN 0016-8033; GPYSA7; TRN: US0000655","10.1190/1.1444694","","2010-06-03T00:00:00Z","20006257","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/20006257","","Geophysics","6","64"

These amorphous reaction products, which ground the partially reacted and unreacted CAC and fly ash particles into a coherent mass, were responsible for strengthening and densifying the SFCB specimens at room temperature, playing an essential role in mitigating their acid erosion. In these cements, the extent of acid erosion depended primarily on the ratio of fly ash/CAC; namely, those with a higher ratio underwent a severe erosion.

"Dynamics of the Galapagos hotspot from helium isotope geochemistry","Kurz, M D; Geist, D","15 GEOTHERMAL ENERGY; VOLCANOES; HOT SPOTS; GEOCHEMISTRY; ISOTOPE RATIO; LAVA; ISOTOPE DATING; ISLANDS; GEOLOGIC MODELS","The authors have measured the isotopes of He, Sr, Nd and Pb in a number of lava flows from the Galapagos Archipelago; the main goal is to use magmatic helium as a tracer of plume influence in the western volcanoes. Because the Galapagos lava flows are so well preserved, it is also possible to measure surface exposure ages using in situ cosmic-ray-produced {sup 3}He. The exposure ages range from {lt}0.1 to 580 Ka, are consistent with other chronological constrains, and provide the first direct dating of these lava flows. The new age data demonstrate the utility of the technique in this important age range and show that the western Galapagos volcanoes have been erupting distance compositions simultaneously for the last {approximately}10 Ka. The magmatic {sup 3}He/{sup 4}He ratios range from 6.0 to 27 times atmospheric (R{sub a}), with the highest values found on the islands of Isabella (16.8 R{sub a} for Vulcan Sierra Negra) and Fernandina (23 to 27 R{sub a}). Values from Santa Cruz are close to typical mid-ocean ridge basalt values (MORB, of {approximately}9 R{sub 2}) and Pinta has a {sup 3}He/{sup 4}He ratio lower than MORB (6.9 R{sub a}). These data confirm that the plume is centered beneath Fernandina which is the most active volcano in the archipelago and is at the leading edge of plate motion. The data are consistent with previous isotopic studies, confirming extensive contributions from depleted asthenospheric or lithospheric mantle sources, especially to the central islands. The most striking aspect of the helium isotopic data is that the {sup 3}He/{sup 4}He ratios decrease systematically in all directions from Fernandina. This spatial variability is assumed to reflect the contribution of the purest plume component to Fernandina magmatism, and shows that helium is a sensitive indicator of plume influence. The highest {sup 3}He/{sup 4}He ratios are found in volcanoes with lowest Na{sub 2}O(8) and FeO(8), which may relate to source composition as well as degree and depth of melting. An excellent correlation is observed between {sup 3}He/{sup 4}He and Nb/La, suggesting that the Galapagos plume source is characterized by high concentrations of Nb (and Ta). The major and trace element correlations demonstrate that helium is controlled by silicate melting and source variations rather than degassing and/or metasomatic processes. Although lavas with radiogenic isotopic compositions tend to have higher {sup 3}He/{sup 4}He, the island-wide isotopic variability cannot be explained by simple two components mixing alone. The preferred model to explain the isotopic data includes a heterogeneous plume, centered at Fernandina, which undergoes polybaric melting, and spatial divergence and mixing with asthenospheric material at shallower depths. The unique regional pattern of the helium isotopic data suggests that helium is extracted more efficiently than other elements during the early stages of melting in the ascending plume.","","","Woods Hole Oceanographic Institution, MA (US)","","","United States","1999-12-01T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: Geochimica et Cosmochimica Acta; Journal Volume: 63; Journal Issue: 23-24; Other Information: PBD: Dec 1999","","Medium: X; Size: page(s) 4139-4156","","","","Journal ID: ISSN 0016-7037; GCACAK; TRN: IM200007%%328","10.1016/S0016-7037(99)00314-2","","2010-06-03T00:00:00Z","20006272","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/20006272","","Geochimica et Cosmochimica Acta","23-24","63"

The authors have analyzed published phase-equilibrium and thermodynamic data for the dry fusion of high albite to develop a more accurate equation for the Biggs free energy of this reaction to 30 kbar and 1,400 C. Strict criteria for reaction reversal were sued to evaluate the phase-equilibrium data, and the thermodynamic properties of solid and liquid albite were evaluated using the published uncertainties in the original measurements. Results suggest that neither available phase-equilibrium experiments nor thermodynamic data tightly constrain the location of the reaction. Experimental solidus temperatures at 1 atm range from 1,100 to 1,120 C. High-pressure experiments were not reversed completely and may have been affected by several sources of error, but the apparent inconsistencies among the results of the various experimentalists are eliminated when only half-reversal data are considered. Uncertainties in thermodynamic data yield large variations in permissible reaction slopes. Disparities between experimental and calculated melting curves are, therefore, largely attributable to these difficulties, and there is no fundamental disagreement between the available phase-equilibrium and thermodynamic data for the dry melting of albite. Consequently, complex speciation models for albitic melts, based on the assumption that these discrepancies represent a real characteristic of the system, are unjustified at this time.","","","Oak Ridge National Lab.

The glasses were cooled at {approximately}10{sub 2}C/s after having been held at 400 to 600C, for sufficient time for the equilibrium distribution of species to have been reached. The speciation of water in samples with greater than 2.5 wt.% total dissolved water and quenched rapidly from temperatures {ge}600C were shown to reequilibrate during quench. However, samples with less than 2.0% water and quenched rapidly from {le}600C, and those with less than 5.5% water and quenched rapidly from {le}500C, did not undergo changes on quench and record the equilibrium species concentrations of the experimental run conditions. Knowledge of the equilibrium speciation of water in samples at lower temperatures can be used to predict the species concentrations at magmatic temperatures and allow one to explore the effect of melt structure on the physical properties of natural hydrous magmas. Their measurements differ with recent studies using in situ measurement techniques that show lesser concentrations of molecular species at magmatic temperatures, and the authors address concerns associated with the in situ method. Their study on quenched glasses can be applied to natural rhyolites; using measured species concentrations, the apparent equilibration temperature can be calculated to within 12 C (2{sigma} uncertainty) which can be used to determine the cooling rate of a naturally quenched rhyolitic glass.","","","California Inst. of Tech., Pasadena, CA (US)","National Science Foundation (NSF); USDOE","","United States","1999-11-01T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: Geochimica et Cosmochimica Acta; Journal Volume: 63; Journal Issue: 21; Other Information: PBD: Nov 1999","","Medium: X; Size: page(s) 3567-3578","","","FG03-85ER13445","Journal ID: ISSN 0016-7037; GCACAK; TRN: IM200007%%318","10.1016/S0016-7037(99)00277-X","","2010-06-03T00:00:00Z","20006262","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/20006262","","Geochimica et Cosmochimica Acta","21","63"

Measurements using single-sale solutions show that the rate-enhancing effects increase in the order: Mg{sup 2+} {lt} Ca{sup 2+} {approximately} Na{sup +} {lt} Ba{sup 2+}. Barium ion increases dissolution rates by 114X compared to new, slower rates found for deionized water (10{sup {minus}8.41}) at 200 C. Experimental activation energies, E{sub xp}, measured for each salt solution are similar within experimental errors. In solution mixtures of two salts, dissolution rates are a nonlinear combination of the bulk concentrations of cations in solution such that rates are limited by the cation with the smallest rate-enhancing effect. That is, a small fraction of magnesium ion in the mixture limits the net dissolution rate to an extent disproportionate to its bulk concentration. This behavior is more pronounced for salt mixtures of 2{sup +}: 1{sup +} cations (i.e. Mg{sup 2+} and Na{sup +}) than 2{sup +}: 2{sup +} cations (i.e. Mg{sup 2+} and Ba{sup 2+} or Ca{sup 2+}). The behavior observed in salt mixtures is quantified by an empirical expression based on a competitive cation-surface interaction model. The kinetic model assumes that salt-enhanced dissolution rates are determined by the intrinsic ability of each type of cation, i, to enhance rates (k{sub mx,i}) and their concentration(s) at the surface (K{sub ad,i}). Estimates of these parameters are obtained by fitting the model to data from the rate versus concentration experiments conducted in single-salt solutions. The resulting kinetic expression gives good predictions of rates measured in salt mixtures and is consistent with previous models of cation-enhanced dissolution kinetics of quartz. The model predicts that magnesium and calcium have greater roles in regulating quartz dissolution rates despite lower concentrations in natural waters than sodium and potassium because of their larger surface interaction strengths.","","","Georgia Inst. of Tech., Atlanta, GA (US)","","","United States","1999-11-01T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: Geochimica et Cosmochimica Acta; Journal Volume: 63; Journal Issue: 22; Other Information: PBD: Nov 1999","","Medium: X; Size: page(s) 3715-3727","","","","Journal ID: ISSN 0016-7037; GCACAK; TRN: IM200007%%320","10.1016/S0016-7037(99)00218-5","","2010-06-03T00:00:00Z","20006264","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/20006264","","Geochimica et Cosmochimica Acta","22","63"

Amplitudes and phases of the 50 Hz signals (and the odd harmonics up to 450 Hz) were determined using a software implementation of a phase-locked filter. These data were then analyzed to determine the components of the magnetotelluric impedance tensor and the corresponding apparent resistivities and phases. At most sites, there was sufficient variation in the elliptical polarization of the EM fields to enable the impedance tensors to be determined in full. Sites where the EM data had been affected by near-source effects were identified by having large vertical magnetic field components and by being closer to a power line source than about 3--5 skin depths. With the test measurements, the north-eastern part of the Tokaanu geothermal field was successfully delineated giving low resistivities ({gt}5{Omega}m) on the inside and higher resistivities on the outside, in agreement with the Schlumberger array DC apparent resistivities.

Most geothermal production wells are currently drilled with tungsten-carbide-insert roller-cone bits. PDC bits have significantly improved penetration rates and bit life beyond roller-cone bits in the oil and gas industry where soft to medium-hard rock types are encountered. If PDC bits could be used to double current penetration rates in hard rock geothermal well-drilling costs could be reduced by 15 percent or more. PDC bits exhibit reasonable life in hard-rock wear testing using the relatively rigid setups typical of laboratory testing. Unfortunately, field experience indicates otherwise. The prevailing mode of failure encountered by PDC bits returning from hard-rock formations in the field is catastrophic, presumably due to impact loading. These failures usually occur in advance of any appreciable wear that might dictate cutter replacement. Self-induced bit vibration, or ''chatter'', is one of the mechanisms that may be responsible for impact damage to PDC cutters in hard-rock drilling. Chatter is more severe in hard-rock formations since they induce significant dynamic loading on the cutter elements. Chatter is a phenomenon whereby the drillstring becomes dynamically unstable and excessive sustained vibrations occur. Unlike forced vibration, the force (i.e., weight on bit) that drives self-induced vibration is coupled with the response it produces. Many of the chatter principles derived in the machine tool industry are applicable to drilling. It is a simple matter to make changes to a machine tool to study the chatter phenomenon. This is not the case with drilling. Chatter occurs in field drilling due to the flexibility of the drillstring. Hence, laboratory setups must be made compliant to observe chatter.","","OSTI as DE00013999","Sandia National Lab. (SNL-NM), Albuquerque, NM (United States); Sandia National Lab.

In the aureole, Skiddaw Group metasedimentary rocks with relatively uniform lithology and major-element compositions show a dramatic decrease in N content toward the granite contact (from {ge}800 ppm at distances >2.5 km from the contact, to <410 ppm {le}0.55 km from the contact). Far from the intrusive body (>1.5 km), these rocks have extremely uniform {delta}{sup 15}N{sub air} near +3.7%, whereas closer to the contact ({le}1 km) {delta}{sup 15}N is shifted to higher values (up to +8.7%). The coupled decreases in N content and increases in {delta}{sup 15}N are compatible with the removal of N having low {delta}{sup 15}N in fluids during continuous, prograde devolatilization reactions involving the breakdown of white mica and the stabilization of biotite-, cordierite-, and andalusite-bearing assemblages. In the same metasedimentary rocks, the lack of obvious trends in major-element concentrations (including SiO{sub 2}/TiO{sub 2}, SiO{sub 2}/Al{sub 2}O{sub 3}, and the ratios of other major oxides to TiO{sub 2} and Al{sub 2}O{sub 3}) with distance from the granitic contact is consistent with minimal change in major element composition during the contact metamorphism.

"Seafloor hydrothermal clay alteration at Jade in the back-arc Okinawa Trough: Mineralogy, geochemistry and isotope characteristics","Marumo, Katsumi; Hattori, K H","15 GEOTHERMAL ENERGY; HYDROTHERMAL SYSTEMS; SEA BED; CLAYS; HYDROTHERMAL ALTERATION; MINERALOGY; GEOCHEMISTRY; ISOTOPE RATIO; GEOLOGIC HISTORY","Seafloor hydrothermal activity at Jade has resulted in extensive alteration of the host epiclastic sediments and pumiceous tuffs, forming mica, kaolins (kaolinite and halloysite), Mg-rich chlorite, talc, montmorillonite, and a mixed-layer mineral of dioctahedral chlorite and montmorillonite (Chl/Mont). Clay mineral assemblages show a vertical variation, which reflects variable amounts of cold seawater incorporated into hot hydrothermal fluids in subsurface sediments and tuff. However, mixing alone cannot explain the occurrence of abundant kaolin minerals at Jade. The formation of kaolin minerals requires much more acidic fluid than expected from simple mixing of hydrothermal fluids and cold seawater. Low pH values are likely attained by oxidation of H{sub 2}S either dissolved in the hydrothermal fluid or released from the fluid during decompression. The fluid reaching the seafloor is discharged into cold seawater, which caused precipitation of sulfides close to vents and native sulfur and barite at the margins of the vent areas. Halloysite, barite and anhydrite show Sr isotope compositions similar to marine Sr, indicating the derivation of marine Sr directly from seawater or by the dissolution of calcareous nannoplanktons. At Jade, there is only one black smoker actively discharging high temperature ({approximately}320 C) fluid, but there are many fossil sulfide chimneys and mounds in the area. The mineralogy and high Au and Cu in these precipitates suggest highly metalliferous hydrothermal activity in the past. These activities likely resulted in discharge of hydrothermal plumes and fall-outs of sulfides and sulfates on the seafloor. These fall-outs were incorporated in sediments far from the vent areas. They are now recorded as high metal contents in sediments with no petrographic and mineralogical evidence of in-situ hydrothermal activity. Some are high as 8,100 ppm for Cu, 12,500 ppm for Zn, 1,000 ppm for As, 100 ppm for Ag and 21,000 ppm for Pb. Detrital grains of montmorillonite in such sediments are coated with Fe-oxyhydroxides during the suspension in seawater before settling on the seafloor. The depths of such metal anomalies in sediments suggest high levels of metalliferous hydrothermal activities from 1,800 to 300 ybp.","","","Geological Survey of Japan, Tsukuba, Ibaraki (JP)","","","United States","1999-09-01T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: Geochimica et Cosmochimica Acta; Journal Volume: 63; Journal Issue: 18; Other Information: PBD: Sep 1999","","Medium: X; Size: page 2785-2804","","","","Journal ID: ISSN 0016-7037; GCACAK","10.1016/S0016-7037(99)00158-1","","2010-06-03T00:00:00Z","20000936","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/20000936","","Geochimica et Cosmochimica Acta","18","63"

Using in situ fluid cell atomic force microscopy (AFM), the authors show that the movement of monomolecular steps comprising growth hillocks on {l{underscore}brace}10{bar 1}4{r{underscore}brace} faces during the growth of this anisotropic material is specific to crystallographic direction. By quantifying the sensitivity of step growth kinetics to supersaturation, the authors can produce spiral hillocks with unique geometries. These forms are caused by a complex dependence of step migration rates, {nu}{sub s{sup +}} and {nu}{sub s{sup {minus}}}, upon small differences in solution chemistry as they grow normal to the conventional fast ([{bar 4}41]{sub +} and [48{bar 1}]{sub +}) and slow ([{bar 4}41]{sub {minus}} and [48{bar 1}]{sub {minus}}) crystallographic directions. As solute activity, a, decreases, {nu}{sub s{sup +}} and {nu}{sub s{sup {minus}}} converge and growth hillocks express a pseudo-isotropic form. At still lower supersaturations where a approaches its equilibrium value, a{sub e}, an inversion in the rates of step advancement produces hillocks with unusual reversed geometries. Comparisons of the kinetic data with classical theoretical models suggest that the observed behavior may be due to minute impurities that impact the kinetics of growth through blocking and incorporation mechanisms. These findings demonstrate the control of crystallographic structure on the local-scale kinetics of growth to stabilize the formation of unusual hillock morphologies at the near-equilibrium conditions found in natural environments.","","","Georgia Inst. of Tech., Atlanta, GA (US)","USDOE","","United States","1999-09-01T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: Geochimica et Cosmochimica Acta; Journal Volume: 63; Journal Issue: 17; Other Information: PBD: Sep 1999","","Medium: X; Size: page 2507-2512","","","FG05-95ER14517; W-7405-ENG-48","Journal ID: ISSN 0016-7037; GCACAK","10.1016/S0016-7037(99)00103-9","","2010-06-03T00:00:00Z","20000931","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/20000931","","Geochimica et Cosmochimica Acta","17","63"
"Widespread assimilation of a seawater-derived component at Loihi Seamount, Hawaii","Kent, A J.R.; Clague, D A; Honda, M; Stolper, E M; Hutcheon, I D; Norman, M D","15 GEOTHERMAL ENERGY; HAWAII; VOLCANOES; VOLCANIC ROCKS; SEAWATER; GEOCHEMISTRY; CHLORIDES; GEOLOGIC HISTORY","Many tholeiitic and transitional pillow-rim and fragmental glasses from Loihi seamount, Hawaii, have high Cl contents and Cl/K{sub 2}O ratios (and ratios of Cl to other incompatible components, such as P{sub 2}O{sub 5}, H{sub 2}O, etc.) relative to other Hawaiian subaerial volcanoes (e.g., Mauna Loa, Mauna Kea, and Kilauea). The authors suggest that this results from widespread contamination of Loihi magmas by a Cl-rich, seawater-derived component. Assimilation of high-Cl phases such as saline brine or Cl-rich minerals (halite or iron-hydroxychlorides) with high Cl/H{sub 2}O ratios can explain the range and magnitude of Cl contents in Loihi glasses, as well as the variations in the ratios of Cl to other incompatible elements. Brines and Cl-rich minerals are thought to form from seawater within the hydrothermal systems associated with submarine volcanoes, and Loihi magmas could plausibly have assimilated such materials from the hydrothermal envelope adjacent to the magma chamber. Their model can also explain semiquantitatively the observed contamination of Loihi glasses with atmospheric-derived noble gases, provided the assimilant has concentrations of Ne and Ar comparable to or slightly less than seawater. This is more likely for brines than for Cl-rich minerals, leading the authors to favor brines as the major assimilant. Cl/Br ratios for a limited number of Loihi samples are also seawater-like, and show no indication of the higher values expected to be associated with the assimilation of Cl-rich hydrothermal minerals. Although Cl enrichment is a common feature of lavas from Loihi, submarine glasses from other Hawaiian volcanoes show little (Kilauea) or no (Mauna Loa, Mauna Kea) evidence of this process, suggesting that assimilation of seawater-derived components is more likely to occur in the early stages of growth of oceanic volcanoes. Summit collapse events such as the one observed at Loihi in October 1996 provide a ready mechanism for depositing brine-bearing rocks from the volcanic edifice into the top of a submarine summit magma chamber.","","","California Inst. of Tech., Pasadena, CA (US)","National Science Foundation (NSF); USDOE","","United States","1999-09-01T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: Geochimica et Cosmochimica Acta; Journal Volume: 63; Journal Issue: 18; Other Information: PBD: Sep 1999","","Medium: X; Size: page 2749-2761","","","FG03-85ER13445; W-7405-ENG-48","Journal ID: ISSN 0016-7037; GCACAK","10.1016/S0016-7037(99)00215-X","","2016-05-02T00:00:00Z","20000934","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/20000934","","Geochimica et Cosmochimica Acta","18","63"

The exchanger consists of a system of pipes or tubes suspended in the well through which clean secondary water is pumped or allowed to circulate by natural convection. These systems offer substantial economic savings over surface heat exchangers where a single-well system is adequate (typically less than 0.8 MWt, with well depths up to about 500 ft) and may be economical under certain conditions at well depths to 1500 ft. Several designs have proven successful; but, the most popular are a simple hairpin loop or multiple loops of iron pipe (similar to the tubes in a U-tube and shell exchanger) extending to near the well bottom. An experimental design consisting of multiple small tubes with headers at each end suspended just below the water surface appears to offer economic and heating capacity advantages.

For anyone not from the area, a geothermally-heated home may be something unfamiliar. This paper is intended to provide some background information to guide one through the purchase of a home equipped with a geothermal system. One aspect of geothermal that is somewhat unique to Klamath Falls is the use of the Downhole Heat Exchanger (also known as a DHE or a loop). This is simply a loop of pipe which is installed in the well and connected to the home`s heating system. Water passes through the DHE, is heated and then passes through the home`s heating system giving up its heat to the space. It is then returned to the DHE to repeat the process. This arrangement eliminates the need to pump water from the well (only heat is removed) and simplifies the system. The paper offers some detailed comments on the systems and some suggestions for questions to ask of one`s agent or the existing homeowner.","","","","USDOE, Washington, DC (United States)","","United States","1999-09-01T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: Geo-Heat Center Quarterly Bulletin; Journal Volume: 20; Journal Issue: 3; Other Information: PBD: Sep 1999","","Medium: X; Size: pp. 14-16","","","FG01-99EE35098","Journal ID: GCQBDW; ISSN 0276-1084; TRN: IM9945%%227","","","2009-12-16T00:00:00Z","691515","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/691515","","Geo-Heat Center Quarterly Bulletin","3","20"

The resin Diaion CRB 02 exhibited a higher sorption capacity for boron removal from 0.01 M H{sub 3}BO{sub 3} solution than did Purolite S 108. The presence of calcium, sodium, and chloride ions did not make a large interference on boron removal by both Diaion CRB 02 and Purolite S 108 resins. The sorption behavior of these two chelating resins obeyed the Langmuir isotherm model. Kinetic tests were performed to find the mass transfer mechanism of the sorption process of boron by Diaion CRB 02 resin. Five kinetic models were applied to fit the kinetic data obtained by using glucamine type-resin Diaion CRB 02. The results showed that the rate-determining step is particle diffusion for boron removal by Diaion CRB 02. The quantitative stripping of boron from both chelating resins was obtained with either 0.05 M H{sub 2}SO{sub 4} or 0.1 M HCl solutions. Boron in wastewater of the Kizildere geothermal field was effectively removed by both Diaion CRB 02 and Purolite S 108 resins.

Diffusion coefficient values were derived from the depth profiles obtained by ion microprobe analysis. The resultant activation energies for Mg tracer diffusion and Ca self-diffusion are, respectively: E{sub a}(Mg) = 284 {+-} 74 kJ/mol and E{sub a}(Ca) = 271 {+-} 80 kJ/mol. For the temperature ranges in these experiments, the diffusion of Mg is faster than Ca. The results are generally consistent in magnitude with divalent cation diffusion rates obtained in previous studies, and provide a means of interpreting the thermal histories of carbonate minerals, the mechanism of dolomitization, and other diffusion-controlled processes. The results indicate that cation diffusion in calcite is relatively slow and cations are the rate-limiting diffusing species for the deformation of calcite and carbonate rocks. Application of the calcite-dolomite geothermometer to metamorphic assemblages will be constrained by cation diffusion and cooling rates. The direct measurement of Mg tracer diffusion in calcite indicates that dolomitization is unlikely to be accomplished by Mg diffusion in the solid state but by a recrystallization process.","","","Sandia National Laboratories (SNL), Albuquerque, NM, and Livermore, CA (United States)","USDOE, Washington, DC (United States)","","United States","1999-09-01T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: American Mineralogist; Journal Volume: 84; Journal Issue: 9; Other Information: PBD: Sep 1999","","Medium: X; Size: pp. 1392-1399","","","AC04-94AL85000","Journal ID: AMMIAY; ISSN 0003-004X; TRN: IM9946%%536","10.2138/am-1999-0917","","2016-04-26T00:00:00Z","697150","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/697150","","American Mineralogist","9","84"

Excess Gibbs free energies are continuously positive and asymmetric toward H{sub 2}O at all pressures up to 400 MPa, rising to peak values of approximately 1300, 1800, 2000, and 2100 J/mol at 50, 100, 200 and 400 MPa, respectively. Calculated activities for H{sub 2}O and CO{sub 2} vary correspondingly, increasing substantially from 0 to 100 MPa, moderately from 100 to 200 MPa, and slightly from 200 to 400 MPa. In addition, because G{sup ex} is asymmetric toward H{sub 2}O, a-X relations for H{sub 2}O are distinctly different from those for CO{sub 2}. These results indicate that CO{sub 2}-H{sub 2}O fluids are strongly nonideal at 400 C and all pressures above {approximately}1 cm{sup 3}/mol at 200 MPa, and remain small to pressures at least as high as 500 MPa. Excess Gibbs free energies and a-X relations for CO{sub 2}-H{sub 2}O fluids at 400 C and pressures to 400 MPa calculated from modified Redlich-Kwong and Lee-Kesler equations of state generally suggest significantly smaller positive deviations from ideality.","","","","USDOE, Washington, DC (United States)","","United States","1999-08-01T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: Geochimica et Cosmochimica Acta; Journal Volume: 63; Journal Issue: 16; Other Information: PBD: Aug 1999","","Medium: X; Size: pp. 2393-2408","","","AC05-96OR22464","Journal ID: GCACAK; ISSN 0016-7037; TRN: IM9944%%387","10.1016/S0016-7037(98)00296-8","","2009-12-16T00:00:00Z","687722","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/687722","","Geochimica et Cosmochimica Acta","16","63"

A series of field samplings and experiments show that the acid was derived from two sources: the release of magmatic volatiles and water-rock reactions. Although the bulk of the magmatic volatiles (CO{sub 2}, H{sub 2}O, and SO{sub 2}) are vented at Puu Oo cinder cone before the lava`s transit downslope to the ocean, a portion of the sulfur (S) and fluoride (F) gases are retained by the lava and then are released partially when the lava is quenched by seawater. The primary water-rock reaction responsible for acid formation appears to be Na-metasomatism, which is much different from the predominant acid-forming reaction found in submarine hydrothermal systems, Mg-metasomatism. Analyses of surface seawater and of precipitation (rain) deposited at the shore show that {approximately}30% of the acid comes from magmatic gases with the balance from reactions between the rock and the salts found in seawater. Experimental results show that {approximately}4 {+-} 1.5 mEq of acid are formed per kilogram of lava entering the ocean, and of this 1 {+-} 0.5 mEq/kg of lava came from S and F, with the balance coming from water-rock reactions. On the basis of lava extrusion rates, {approximately}200--720 {times} 10{sup 6} Eq/yr of acid are being formed at this site. The deposition of the acid results in the alteration of subaerial lava flows along the coast, and the lowering of the pH of the adjacent surface ocean waters by more than 1 unit. The ejection of this acid into the atmosphere contributes to the formation of an extensive haze downwind of the lava entries.","","","","","","United States","1999-08-01T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: Geochimica et Cosmochimica Acta; Journal Volume: 63; Journal Issue: 15; Other Information: PBD: Aug 1999","","Medium: X; Size: pp. 2183-2198","","","","Journal ID: GCACAK; ISSN 0016-7037; TRN: IM9944%%379","10.1016/S0016-7037(99)00193-3","","2009-12-16T00:00:00Z","687714","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/687714","","Geochimica et Cosmochimica Acta","15","63"

With this technique, it is possible to measure directly the surface retreat of alumino-silicates as a function of time and thereby the dissolution rate using a new application of interferometry. The dissolution experiments are carried out in a flow-through cell system with a near endmember anorthite (An{sub 98}) from Miyake-Jima, Tokyo, Japan, Perchloric acid solutions (pH 3) were used at a constant temperature of 25 C. After having measured the topography of the original pristine anorthite surface, measurements of the surface normal retreat were taken after 48,84,120, and 168 hrs of run duration at 15 different regions on the surface. An internal-reference technique allows absolute measurements of the changes in surface height for the very first time. From these measurements, an average bulk rate for dissolution of the (010) anorthite surface is calculated to be 5.7 x 10{sup {minus}13} [moles/cm{sub 2}/sec]. Finally, their directly determined bulk rate for the (010) face is compared with the bulk rates calculated from the rate law obtained from powder experiments and using the BET or total surface area.","","","Yale Univ., New Haven, CT (US)","USDOE; National Science Foundation (NSF); Alexander von Humboldt Foundation","","United States","1999-07-01T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: American Journal of Science; Journal Volume: 299; Journal Issue: 7-9; Other Information: PBD: 1999","","Medium: X; Size: page(s) 652-678","","","FG02-90ER14153","Journal ID: ISSN 0002-9599; AJSCAP; TRN: IM200007%%310","10.2475/ajs.299.7-9.652","","2010-06-03T00:00:00Z","20006254","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/20006254","","American Journal of Science","7-9","299"

Detailed mineralogical analysis revealed an assemblage with kaolinite, alunite, and opal-C as the major mineral phases. Electron paramagnetic resonance spectroscopy (EPR) showed 3 different redox-sensitive cations associated with the mineral phases, Cu{sup +} is structure-bound in opal-C, whereas VO{sup 2+} and Fe{sup 3+} are located in the kaolinite structure. The location of the redox-sensitive cations in different minerals of the assemblage is indicative of different chemical conditions. The formation of the alteration products can be described schematically as a 2-step process. In a first step alunite and opal-C were precipitated in a fluid with slightly reducing conditions and a low chloride availability. The second step is characterized by a decrease in K{sup +} activity and subsequent formation of kaolinite under weakly oxidizing to oxidizing redox conditions as indicated by structure-bound VO{sup 2+} and Fe{sup 3+}. The detection of paramagnetic trace elements structure-bound in mineral phases by EPR provide direct information about the prevailing redox conditions during alteration and can, therefore, be used as additional insight into the genesis of the hydrothermal, near-surface system.","","","","","","United States","1999-07-01T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: Geochimica et Cosmochimica Acta; Journal Volume: 63; Journal Issue: 13-14; Other Information: PBD: Jul 1999","","Medium: X; Size: pp. 2061-2069","","","","Journal ID: GCACAK; ISSN 0016-7037; TRN: IM9944%%377","10.1016/S0016-7037(99)00134-9","","2009-12-16T00:00:00Z","687712","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/687712","","Geochimica et Cosmochimica Acta","13-14","63"

The computation algorithm is based on the electrostatic approach for the interaction between aqueous species and H{sub 2}O. The approach uses the SUPCRT92 database and the HKF format and may be considered as an application of the revised HKF model for mixed H{sub 2}O-non-polar gas fluids. Thermodynamic properties of dissolved gases at high temperatures and pressures are calculated using the Redlich-Kwong approach. Dielectric permittivity of the mixed solvent is estimated by the modified Kirkwood equation. The proposed approach is validated using available experimental data on the dissociation constants of H{sub 2}O and NaCl and the solubility of both covalent and ion crystals (SiO{sub 2}, AgCl, Ag{sub 2}SO{sub 4}, Ca(OH){sub 2}, CaCO{sub 3}) in H{sub 2}O-non-polar component (dioxane, Ar, CO{sub 2}) mixtures. Predicted and experimental data are in close agreement over a wide range of P-T-x{sub gas} conditions (up to 500 C, 4 kbar and 0.25--0.3 mole fraction of non-polar gas). It is also shown how the computation method can be applied to estimate the Born parameters of aqueous species. The proposed approach enables not only examination of isolated reactions, but the study of equilibria of whole systems. Thus, it allows modelling of mixed natural fluids.","","","","","","United States","1999-07-01T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: Geochimica et Cosmochimica Acta; Journal Volume: 63; Journal Issue: 13-14; Other Information: PBD: Jul 1999","","Medium: X; Size: pp. 2025-2041","","","","Journal ID: GCACAK; ISSN 0016-7037; TRN: IM9944%%376","10.1016/S0016-7037(98)00304-4","","2009-12-16T00:00:00Z","687711","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/687711","","Geochimica et Cosmochimica Acta","13-14","63"

The existence of each trace metal at the single site in the bulk crystal is significant in view of previous studies showing that these trace elements are incorporated differentially at multiple, structurally distinct surface sites occurring in nonequivalent growth steps on calcite surfaces. The octahedral coordination for Ba is particularly noteworthy because of its large size (35% larger than host Ca) and the fact that it rarely exists as a major constituent with such a low coordination number. Analysis of the local distortion and relaxation around the impurities shows a nearly complete contraction of the structure around Co{sup 2+} and Zn{sup 2+}. The Co-O and Zn-O first-shell distances are only slightly longer than in CoCO{sub 3} and ZnCO{sub 3}, with a site compliance of {approximately}80--90%. Displacements of higher shells relative to those in calcite decrease rapidly, but irregularly, over a short distance, and the relaxation may be largely confined within 6--7 {angstrom} of the impurity. The dilation around the large Pb{sup 2+} and Ba{sup 2+} ions in calcite also shows a high degree of site compliance (85--90%). Relaxation around Pb and Ba also appears to be restricted, but extending further for Ba than for Pb. The limited observations suggest that compliance of the octahedral site in calcite is larger than for the cation site in the rocksalt structure. The high compliance for the metal site in calcite may reflect the corner-sharing topology of the structure and is also probably the reason that calcite shows such a wide range of isovalent substitutions in nature. The findings also provide a direct indication of the local strain associated with a dilute substitutional solid solution.","","","","USDOE, Washington, DC (United States)","","United States","1999-07-01T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: American Mineralogist; Journal Volume: 84; Journal Issue: 7-8; Other Information: PBD: Jul-Aug 1999","","Medium: X; Size: pp. 1049-1060","","","","Journal ID: AMMIAY; ISSN 0003-004X; TRN: IM9943%%282","10.2138/am-1999-7-807","","2016-05-26T00:00:00Z","684591","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/684591","","American Mineralogist","7-8","84"

The experiments were conducted in standard cold-seal pressure vessels at 680 C and 500 MPa in the T-P-X{sub CO{sub 2}} stability field of the calcite-forsterite assemblage for 2, 5, 10, 20, 40 and 80 days, respectively. The weight ratio of mineral to fluid in the starting mixture is 1.46; the fluid was a mixture of H{sub 2}O and CO{sub 2} with the mole fraction of CO{sub 2} being 0.1. The results show that the oxygen isotope exchange between the minerals was accomplished via mineral-fluid exchange by a dual-mechanism, i.e. initial rapid exchange due to Ostwald ripening of both calcite and forsterite, followed by a slower diffusion-controlled process. Furthermore, for the given fluid composition, calcite shows a greater rate of dissolution-recrystallization and oxygen isotope exchange with fluid than forsterite. As a result, oxygen isotope fractionations between calcite and forsterite and between the minerals and the fluid can simply pass the equilibrium fractionations with time and even lead to crossover behavior. Once diffusion becomes a primary mechanism for further isotope exchange in the three-phase system, the rate of oxygen diffusion in calcite is equal to, or slightly less than that in forsterite.","","","","","","United States","1999-06-01T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: Geochimica et Cosmochimica Acta; Journal Volume: 63; Journal Issue: 11-12; Other Information: PBD: Jun 1999","","Medium: X; Size: pp. 1781-1786","","","","Journal ID: GCACAK; ISSN 0016-7037; TRN: IM9944%%368","10.1016/S0016-7037(99)00127-1","","2009-12-16T00:00:00Z","687703","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/687703","","Geochimica et Cosmochimica Acta","11-12","63"

Heat associated with the emplacement of the mafic intrusions generated fluid flow in the overlying plateau lavas. {delta}{sup 18}O values for whole rocks from the NSVG and hypabyssal sills range from 5.5 to 17.7{per_thousand} and 5.3 to 11.5{per_thousand}, respectively, and most values are higher than those considered normal for basaltic rocks (5.4 to 6.0{per_thousand}). In general, there is a positive correlation between whole rock {delta}{sup 18}O and water content, which suggests that elevated {delta}{sup 18}O values are related primarily to secondary mineral growth and isotopic exchange during hydrothermal alteration and metamorphism. {delta}{sup 18}O{sub H{sub 2}O} values computed from amygdule-filling minerals such as smectite, chlorite, and epidote found in low- to high-temperature metamorphic zones range from {approximately}{minus}1 to 6{per_thousand} with an average value of {approximately}3{per_thousand}. Smectite in the lower-grade zones gives computed {delta}D{sub H{sub 2}O} values between {minus}26 and {minus}83{per_thousand}, whereas epidote in the higher-grade zones gives {delta}D{sub H{sub 2}O} values of {minus}15 to 6{per_thousand}. Fluid isotopic compositions computed from epidote and smectite values are suggestive of the involvement of at least two fluids during the early stages of amygdule filling. Fluid {delta}D and {delta}{sup 18}O values determined from epidote at the higher metamorphic grades indicate that seawater dominated the deeper portions of the system where greenschist facies assemblages and elevated {delta}{sup 18}O values were produced in flow interiors, as well as margins. Smectite isotopic compositions suggest that meteoric water was predominant in the shallower portions of the system. The increase in {delta}{sup 18}O values of massive flow interiors with depth is interpreted as a result of rock interaction with a fluid of constant oxygen isotopic composition with increasing temperature. The stable isotopic data are supportive of previous suggestions that seawater was involved in the hydrothermal system associated with the Midcontinent Rift. Although the origin of the seawater remains problematic, it appears that marine incursions may have occurred during the late stages of Portage Lake volcanism, and periodically thereafter.","","","","","","United States","1999-06-01T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: Geochimica et Cosmochimica Acta; Journal Volume: 63; Journal Issue: 11-12; Other Information: PBD: Jun 1999","","Medium: X; Size: pp. 1787-1804","","","","Journal ID: GCACAK; ISSN 0016-7037; TRN: IM9944%%369","10.1016/S0016-7037(99)00101-5","","2009-12-16T00:00:00Z","687704","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/687704","","Geochimica et Cosmochimica Acta","11-12","63"

After subtraction of non-plume background particle composition, plume particles at 9{degree}45(minutes)N and in the TAG plume on the Mid-Atlantic Ridge had indistinguishable ranges of light REE-enriched fractionation relative to ambient seawater and had very similar Sm/Fe, demonstrating that plume particles in both oceans reflect to a first degree the local seawater REE composition. Within-plume REE variations at 9{degree}45(minutes)N were investigated using a simple mixing model which accounts for the bulk Fe-Al-Mn variations in the plume using two endmembers: fresh hydrothermal oxyhydroxide precipitates and ridge-crest background particles. Sm/Fe and Nd/Er plot linearly with mixing ratio (R > 0.96), implying that the observed REE trends result from mixing of these two endmembers. Extrapolation to the composition of pure hydrothermal precipitates suggests that Nd/Er is fractionated relative to seawater by a factor of 1.8 during adsorption onto fresh Fe oxyhydroxide particles. In sum, REE behavior in hydrothermal plumes is more consistent with equilibrium adsorption and mixing of distinct particle types, than with kinetic uptake control.","","","","","","United States","1999-06-01T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: Geochimica et Cosmochimica Acta; Journal Volume: 63; Journal Issue: 11-12; Other Information: PBD: Jun 1999","","Medium: X; Size: pp. 1709-1722","","","","Journal ID: GCACAK; ISSN 0016-7037; TRN: IM9944%%365","10.1016/S0016-7037(99)00182-9","","2009-12-16T00:00:00Z","687700","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/687700","","Geochimica et Cosmochimica Acta","11-12","63"

Results were obtained in 130 runs under conditions equivalent to medium pressure amphibolite facies. Experiments were performed with and without CaCl{sub 2} dissolved in a supercritical CO{sub 2} - H{sub 2}O mixture (CaCl{sub 2} = 0 to 0.5 mol/l water; X{sub CO{sub 2}} = 0.75 and 0.25). The pressure was 5 {+-} 0.05 kb, and the temperatures ranged from 630 to 720 C ({+-}3 C), with six different temperature oversteps of 13 up to 103 C above the equilibrium temperature at 617 C. Percent conversion, measured by CO{sub 2} production as a function of time for a period of up to 34 days (816 hrs), is presented, and the appropriate reaction rate constants (up to k = 5 x 10{sup {minus}8} mol/m{sup 2} sec) as well as the apparent activation energies (E{sub app} = 255--470 kJ/mol) are extracted from the measured data. The observed asymmetric sigmoidal shape of all conversion versus time curves indicates changes in the rate-limiting process during the reaction. The development of the overall kinetics as a result of the combination of the different sub-processes (dissolution, nucleation, and growth of reactants and product) are discussed. Analysis of the experimental results shows that the reaction rates obtained from a chloride-bearing fluid are an order of magnitude larger than those obtained from chloride-free experiments. The implications for natural systems are quite important, because their results suggest that reaction rates may indeed be much faster than originally expected. Additionally, there seems to be evidence that nucleation starts earlier and is increased in the presence of a fluid that has even a low chloride content.","","","Univ.

The distribution coefficients D{sub Na}, D{sub K}, D{sub Rb}, and D{sub Cu} (D{sub i} = C{sub iv}/C{sub im}, where C{sub iv} and C{sub im} are the concentrations of element i in the aqueous fluid and the melt, respectively) increase linearly with the (Na, K)Cl concentration in the fluid, indicating the presence of (Na, K, Rb, or Cu)Cl complexes. D{sub Sr} shows a quadratic relation with the chloride concentration, suggesting a SrCl{sub 2} complex in these fluids.

In contrast, Al, Ge, Mo, W, La, and Ce strongly partition toward the melt. NaF has little effect on the partitioning of these elements, except for Al, W, and Mo. D{sub Al} increases with increasing NaF content. At low NaF concentrations, W and Mo are enriched in the aqueous fluid, but at higher NaF contents they partition toward the silicate melt.

The quenched glasses are highly peralkaline in the experiments with (Na,K){sub 2}CO{sub 3}, slightly peralkaline with NaF, slightly peraluminous with pure H{sub 2}O or (Na,K)Cl, and highly peraluminous with HCl. D{sub Al} and D{sub Ge} increase slightly in peralkaline melts. In the experiments with highly peraluminous melts, the distribution coefficient for all the elements, except Al, Ge, and W, is {much_gt} 1.

The data indicate that the smectite to chlorite transition is prevalent, but a secondary smectite to illite transition is also present. At depths approximately <750 m, smectite with very minor chlorite mixed-layers (approximately <15%) is dominant, and has a composition midway between a di- and tri-smectite. At {approximately}750 m there is a very clear distinction and sharp transition into discrete chlorite with very minor smectite mixed-layers (approximately <10%). Corrensite is recorded only as a rare and minor phase. Smectite occurs in abundance at temperatures up to {approximately}200 C, and the transition from a smectite-dominant to chlorite-dominant assemblage takes place over a narrow temperature range ({approximately}150 to 200 C). The stability range of smectite is very similar to that recorded in other geothermal systems, whereas the smectite to chlorite transition differs greatly from that recorded in other systems. The transition does not involve continuous chlorite/smectite mixed-layering but a marked step: It is the sharpest and most discontinuous stepped sequence of this mineralogical transition recorded.","","","","USDOE","","United States","1999-04-01T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: American Mineralogist; Journal Volume: 84; Journal Issue: 4; Other Information: PBD: Apr 1999","","Medium: X; Size: pp. 607-619","","","","Journal ID: AMMIAY; ISSN 0003-004X; TRN: IM9921%%229","10.2138/am-1999-0414","","2016-05-12T00:00:00Z","343765","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/343765","","American Mineralogist","4","84"
"Yttrium and rare earth elements in fluids from various deep-sea hydrothermal systems","Douville, E; ; Appriou, P; Bienvenu, P; Charlou, J L; Donval, J P; Fouquet, Y; Gamo, Toshitaka","15 GEOTHERMAL ENERGY; HYDROTHERMAL SYSTEMS; YTTRIUM; RARE EARTHS; GEOCHEMISTRY; GEOTHERMAL FLUIDS; PACIFIC OCEAN; ATLANTIC OCEAN; PHASE STUDIES; EXPERIMENTAL DATA","Rare earth element (REE) and yttrium (Y) concentrations were measured in fluids collected from deep-sea hydrothermal systems including the Mid-Atlantic Ridge (MAR), i.e., Menez Gwen, Lucky Strike, TAG, and Snakepit; the East Pacific Rise (EPR), i.e., 13{degree}N and 17--19{degree}S; and the Lau (Vai Lili) and Manus (Vienna Woods, PacManus, Desmos) Back-arc Basins (BAB) in the South-West Pacific. In most fluids, Y is trivalent and behaves like Ho. Chondrite normalized Y-REE (Y-REE{sub N}) concentrations of fluids from MAR, EPR, and two BAB sites, i.e., Vai Lili and Vienna Woods, showed common patterns with LREE enrichment and positive Eu anomalies. REE analysis of plagioclase collected at Lucky Strike strengthens the idea that fluid REE contents, are controlled by plagioclase phenocrysts. Other processes, however, such as REE complexation by ligands (Cl{sup {minus}}, F{sup {minus}}, So{sub 4}{sup 2{minus}}), secondary phase precipitation, and phase separation modify REE distributions in deep-sea hydrothermal fluids. REE speciation calculations suggest that aqueous REE are mainly complexed by Cl{sup {minus}} ions in hot acidic fluids from deep-sea hydrothermal systems. REE concentrations in the fluid phases are, therefore, influenced by temperature, pH, and duration of rock-fluid interaction. Unusual Y-REE{sub N} patterns found in the PacManus fluids are characterized by depleted LREE and a positive Eu anomaly. The Demos fluid sample shows a flat Y-REE{sub N} pattern, which increases regularly from LREE to HREE with no Eu anomaly. These Manus Basin fluids also have an unusual major element chemistry with relatively high Mg, So{sub 4}, H{sub 2}S, and F contents, which may be due to the incorporation of magmatic fluids into heated seawater during hydrothermal circulation. REE distribution in PacManus fluids may stem from a subseafloor barite precipitation and the REE in Demos fluids are likely influenced by the presence of sulfate ions.","","","","","","United States","1999-03-01T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: Geochimica et Cosmochimica Acta; Journal Volume: 63; Journal Issue: 5; Other Information: PBD: Mar 1999","","Medium: X; Size: pp. 627-643","","","","Journal ID: GCACAK; ISSN 0016-7037; TRN: IM9931%%191","10.1016/S0016-7037(99)00024-1","","2009-12-16T00:00:00Z","355671","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/355671","","Geochimica et Cosmochimica Acta","5","63"

They are valid in the range 0 to 350 C, at 1 bar below 100 C and at vapor saturation pressures (P{sub sat}) at higher temperatures. The equations for low-albite and microcline are valid for Amelia albite and for microcline with the same degree of Al-Si order (Z = 0.95), respectively. The same kind of log K-temperature equations have also been retrieved for alkali-feldspar and plagioclase solid solutions. The calculated feldspar equilibrium constants of this study indicate much higher solubility under weathering conditions than generally accepted to date, the difference being more than one and a half orders of magnitude at 0 C for both high- and low-albite, but somewhat less for microcline, sanidine, and anorthite. This higher solubility is largely a consequence of new data for the thermodynamic properties of H{sub 4}SiO{sub 4}{sup 0}. The present results have a particularly important bearing on the stability of feldspars under weathering conditions and the study of interaction between water and rock/soil in this environment. They are, however, also important for the study of equilibrium/dis-equilibrium conditions in active geothermal systems.","","","","USDOE","","United States","1999-03-01T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: American Journal of Science; Journal Volume: 299; Journal Issue: 3; Other Information: PBD: Mar 1999","","Medium: X; Size: pp. 173-209","","","","Journal ID: AJSCAP; ISSN 0002-9599; TRN: IM9931%%195","10.2475/ajs.299.3.173","","2016-04-11T00:00:00Z","355675","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/355675","","American Journal of Science","3","299"

In order to widen the bridge across the US Bureau of Reclamation A Canal and to have the road cross under the Southern Pacific Railroad main north-south line, a new bridge and roadway were constructed at the beginning of this urban route. Because the approach and stop where this roadway intersected Alameda Ave (now Hwy 50 -- Eastside Bypass) caused problems with traffic getting traction in the winter on an adverse 8% grade, a geothermal experiment in pavement de-icing was incorporated into the project. A grid system within the pavement was connected to a nearby geothermal well using a downhole heat exchanger (DHE). The 419-foot well provided heat to a 50-50 ethylene glycol-water solution that ran through the grid system at about 50 gpm. This energy could provide a relatively snow free pavement at an outside temperature of {minus}10 F and snowfall up to 3 inches per hour, at a heat requirement of 41 Btu/hr/ft{sup 2}. Over time, the well temperature dropped from 143 to 98 F at the surface. The bridge and surface pavement, geothermal well, and associated equipment were modified.

The 50--60-m-thick roof is overlain by a 150--200-m-thick low-velocity zone that may correspond to a fracture zone that hosts the hydrothermal circulation, and the roof itself may be the transition zone separating the magma chamber from circulating fluids. Furthermore, enhanced hydrothermal activity at the sea floor seems to be associated with a fresh supply of magma in the crust from the mantle. The presence of the solid floor indicates that at least the upper gabbros of the oceanic lower crust are formed by cooling and crystallization of melt in magma chambers.","","","","","","United States","1999-03-01T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: Geology; Journal Volume: 27; Journal Issue: 3; Other Information: PBD: Mar 1999","","Medium: X; Size: pp. 219-222","","","","Journal ID: GLGYBA; ISSN 0091-7613; TRN: IM9919%%161","10.1130/0091-7613(1999)027<0219:SEFAHL>2.3.CO;2","","2009-12-16T00:00:00Z","338545","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/338545","","Geology","3","27"
"Aquaculture in the Imperial Valley -- A geothermal success story","Rafferty, K","15 GEOTHERMAL ENERGY; SALTON SEA GEOTHERMAL FIELD; AQUACULTURE; FISHERIES; GEOTHERMAL WATER HEATING; TEMPERATURE CONTROL; WATER CHEMISTRY; ENERGY CONSUMPTION","The Salton Sea and Imperial Valley area of southern California has long been recognized as a hot spot of geothermal development. In the geothermal industry, this area has for some time been synonymous with electric power generation projects. Starting with the first plant in East Mesa in 1979, geothermal power has increased over the years to the present 400+ MW of installed capacity in the three primary areas of Salton Sea, Heber and East Mesa. Although most in the industry are aware of the millions of kilowatt-hours annually produced in this desert oasis of development, they remain surprisingly uninformed about the Valley`s other geothermal industry -- aquaculture. At present, there are approximately 15 fish farming (or aquaculture) operations clustered, for the most part, around the Salton Sea. All of these farms use geothermal fluids to control the temperature of the fish culture facilities so as to produce larger fish in a shorter period of time and to permit winter production which would otherwise not be possible. In aggregate, these farms produce on the order of 10,000,000 lbs of fish per year most of which is sold into the California market. Principle species are catfish, striped bass and tilapia. For the past several years, tilapia has been the fastest growing part of the aquaculture industry. In 1996, the total US consumption of tilapia was 62,000 lbs. Of this, only 16,000,000 lbs (26%) was domestically produced and the balance imported. The primary market for the fish on the West Coast is among the Asian-American populations in the major cities. Fish are shipped and sold liver at the retail level.","","","","USDOE, Washington, DC (United States)","","United States","1999-03-01T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: Geo-Heat Center Quarterly Bulletin; Journal Volume: 20; Journal Issue: 1; Other Information: PBD: Mar 1999","","Medium: X; Size: pp. 1-4","","","FG07-90ID13040","Journal ID: GCQBDW; ISSN 0276-1084; TRN: IM9919%%222","","","2009-12-16T00:00:00Z","338606","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/338606","","Geo-Heat Center Quarterly Bulletin","1","20"

It has been in continuous operation for 35 years and now heats 11 buildings ({approximately}600,000 ft{sup 2}/55,700 m{sup 2}). It is the oldest of the modern geothermal district-heating systems, and due to the lack of experience with the design of large systems in the early-1960s, it has experienced some difficulties through the years. These difficulties have been resolved and the experience has provided a substantial body of information concerning the applicability of various materials and designs for low-temperature use. The paper describes the original system and the redesigned system.","","","","USDOE, Washington, DC (United States)","","United States","1999-03-01T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: Geo-Heat Center Quarterly Bulletin; Journal Volume: 20; Journal Issue: 1; Other Information: PBD: Mar 1999","","Medium: X; Size: pp. 10-13","","","FG07-90ID13040","Journal ID: GCQBDW; ISSN 0276-1084; TRN: IM9919%%224","","","2009-12-16T00:00:00Z","338608","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/338608","","Geo-Heat Center Quarterly Bulletin","1","20"
"Klamath Falls geothermal district heating systems","Brown, B","15 GEOTHERMAL ENERGY; 32 ENERGY CONSERVATION, CONSUMPTION, AND UTILIZATION; KLAMATH FALLS; GEOTHERMAL DISTRICT HEATING; CENTRAL HEATING PLANTS; CAPACITY; RELIABILITY; PERFORMANCE; DESIGN; PAVEMENTS","The city of Klamath Falls, Oregon, geothermal district heating system was constructed in 1981 to initially serve 14 government buildings with planned expansion to serve additional buildings along the route. After a difficult start-up period, the system has provided reliable service since 1991. For more information on the system development, see Lienau, et al., (1989 and 1991). The district heating system was designed for a thermal capacity of 20 million Btu/hr (5.9 MWt). At peak heating, the original buildings on the system utilized only about 20 percent of the system thermal capacity, and revenue from heating those buildings was inadequate to sustain system operation. This led the city to begin a marketing effort in 1992 to add more customers to the system. Since 1992, the customer base has increased substantially, with the district heating system serving several additional buildings and extensive areas of sidewalk snowmelt. In the winter of 1998 to 1999 the district heating system served the highest load ever, with peak loads estimated at 50 to 60 percent of the original design capacity. The system showed some strain under the load, with operational difficulties related to capacity, controls and equipment failures. System upgrade and maintenance work is scheduled for the summer of 1999 to improve system capacity, control, and reliability.","","","","USDOE, Washington, DC (United States)","","United States","1999-03-01T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: Geo-Heat Center Quarterly Bulletin; Journal Volume: 20; Journal Issue: 1; Other Information: PBD: Mar 1999","","Medium: X; Size: pp. 5-9","","","FG07-90ID13040","Journal ID: GCQBDW; ISSN 0276-1084; TRN: IM9919%%223","10.1080/073993399245926","","2009-12-16T00:00:00Z","338607","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/338607","","Geo-Heat Center Quarterly Bulletin","1","20"

From measurements of the induction times preceding the onset of precipitation the surface energy of the forming solid, identified as gypsum, was found between ca. 12 and 25 mJ/m{sup 2} for the temperature range between 80.0 and 25.0 C, respectively. Kinetics analysis showed that over 50 C it is possible that anhydrous calcium sulfate is forming as a transient phase converting into the more stable calcium sulfate dihydrate. The linear dependence of the rates of precipitation on the relative solution supersaturation suggested a mechanism according to which the growth units are integrated into the active sites of the supercritical nuclei by surface diffusion. According to the morphological examination of the crystals it is possible that crystal growth occurs by the advancement of steps.","","","","","","United States","1999-02-16T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: Langmuir; Journal Volume: 15; Journal Issue: 4; Other Information: PBD: 16 Feb 1999","","Medium: X; Size: pp. 1534-1540","","","","Journal ID: LANGD5; ISSN 0743-7463; TRN: IM9914%%35","10.1021/la9800912","","2009-12-16T00:00:00Z","328228","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/328228","","Langmuir","4","15"

In one series of experiments, the Northrop-Clayton partial exchange method was used where three (sometimes four) isotopically different waters were reacted with chlorite. The percents of exchange determined for the four times from shortest to longest are 4.4, 6.5, 8.0, and 11.9. The fractionations calculated from the Northrop and Clayton method are in modest agreement for the four run durations: 0.13, 0.26, {minus}0.46, and {minus}0.55 per mil. Errors associated with each of these fractionations are quite large (e.g. {+-}1.2 per mil for the longest run). The value determined for the longest run of {approximately}20 weeks is the most reliable of the group and compares very closely with a value of {approximately}{minus}0.7 per mil estimated by Wenner and Taylor based on natural chlorides. Good agreement is also observed with the estimates, {minus}1.2 and {minus}1.3% calculated at 350 C for chlorite compositions with [({Sigma}Fe)/{Sigma}Fe + Mg] = 0.313 and 0.444, respectively, from equations given by Savin and Lee based on their empirical bond-type method. Additional fractionation data have been estimated from hydrothermal granite-fluid experiments where chlorite formed from biotite. Detailed thin section, scanning electron microscope (SEM), x-ray diffraction (XRD), and electron microprobe analyses demonstrate that biotite is altered exclusively to chlorite in 13 granite-fluid experiments conducted at the following conditions: T = 170--300 C, P = vapor saturation - 200 b, salinity = H{sub 2}O, 0.1 and 1 m NaCl, fluid/biotite mass ratios = 3--44, run durations = 122--772 h. The amount of chlorite, quantified through point counting and XRD, increased with increasing temperature, salinity, and time. The isotope compositions of chlorite were calculated from mass balance and compared to the final measured {delta}{sup 18}O of the fluids. The 10{sup 3}ln {alpha} values averaged 0.14, 0.8 and 2.9 per mil for 300, 250, and 200 C, respectively.

The origin of hydrothermal brines, which have been analyzed also for O and H isotopes, is essentially meteoric-hydrothermal. Air-corrected isotope compositions of helium (2.2 Rc/Ra < {sup 3}He/{sup 4}He < 8.6 Rc/Ra) and carbon ({minus}20 < {delta}{sup 13}C{sub PDB} < +0.5) are variable and require a variety of crustal and magmatic sources. The diversity of {delta}{sup 13}C{sub PDB} and {sup 3}He/CO{sub 2} ratios within individual volcanic centers suggests that crustal sources (e.g., limestone) contaminate magmatic CO{sub 2} en route from high-level magma reservoirs (depth < 15 km) to the surface. A similar contamination may be found for magmatic helium on distal springs. The {sup 3}He/{sup 4}He signature of summit fumaroles, thought to reflect the {sup 3}He/{sup 4}He signature of high-level magmas, shows a remarkable systematic variation along the arc. In addition, there is a correlation throughout the arc between published Sr, Pb, and Nd isotope signatures of lavas and the {sup 3}He/{sup 4}He signatures of summit fumaroles. On the northern islands (Nevis, Montserrat, Guadeloupe, and Dominica) summit fumaroles have the N-MORB signature ({sup 3}He/{sup 4}He = 8 {+-} 1 R/Ra), and the isotope signature of lavas is not dissimilar from comparable intra-oceanic arc tholeiites elsewhere. Variable enrichments in radiogenic Sr and Pb have been reported for lavas of individual volcanic centers of the Southern Islands (Martinique, St Lucia, and Grenada), and summit fumaroles on these centers match these variations by variable radiogenic He-enrichments, i.e., lower {sup 3}He/{sup 4}He ratios. This correlation suggests that radiogenic Sr and Pb enrichments of lavas and low {sup 3}He/{sup 4}He signatures on summit fumaroles have a common origin, i.e., a terrigenous contaminant derived from the Orinoco depositionary fan. Crustal assimilation is thought to decouple the He isotope system from any other radiogenic isotope system and, therefore, the authors argue that the observed correlation of He, Sr, Pb, and Nd isotope systems is related to a terrigenous contaminant derived from subducted sediments. Support for this scenario also comes from the matching of low {sup 3}He/{sup 4}He ratios and tectonic features of the forearc thought to favor the subduction of forearc sediments. The present study offers a first clue that, under suitable conditions, crustal helium from oceanic sediments might be subducted to the depth of arc magma sources and, possibly, even recycled into the deeper mantle.","","","","","","United States","1999-02-01T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: Geochimica et Cosmochimica Acta; Journal Volume: 63; Journal Issue: 3-4; Other Information: PBD: Feb 1999","","Medium: X; Size: pp. 515-532","","","","Journal ID: GCACAK; ISSN 0016-7037; TRN: IM9931%%190","10.1016/S0016-7037(99)00018-6","","2009-12-16T00:00:00Z","355670","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/355670","","Geochimica et Cosmochimica Acta","3-4","63"
"A mechanistic model for calcite crystal growth using surface speciation","Nilsson, O; Sternbeck, J","15 GEOTHERMAL ENERGY; 54 ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCES; CALCITE; CRYSTAL GROWTH; MATHEMATICAL MODELS; REACTION KINETICS; CARBON DIOXIDE; ENVIRONMENTAL TRANSPORT","A new mechanistic model for the crystal growth kinetics of calcite is presented, accounting for the presence of various surface complexes. Calcite crystal growth rates were determined with the constant composition method at {Omega}{sub c} (calcite supersaturation) values of 1.5--9.8. In general the rate increases with {Omega}{sub c}, but variations in CO{sub 2} partial pressures and the (CO{sub 3}{sup 2{minus}})/(Ca{sup 2+}) ratio also have a major effect on the crystal growth rate. These effects are eliminated by assuming that calcite crystal growth proceeds through three reversible reactions, in which CaCO{sub 3}{sup 0}(aq) and Ca{sup 2+}(aq) are incorporated at specific surface complexes. The model derived rates closely follow the experimental rates over the entire experimental range (r = 0.996, n = 23). The obtained rate constants indicate that CaCO{sub 3}{sup 0}(aq) is {approx} 20 times more reactive than Ca{sup 2+}(aq) at the calcite-water interface. This agrees with the fact that dehydration of metal ions precedes crystal growth and, in analogy with other metal-ligand complexes, the CO{sub 3}{sup 2{minus}} ligand will increase the rate of water exchange of Ca. This model is a modified version of a rhodochrosite crystal growth model (Sternbeck, 1997) which allows for the comparison of reaction mechanisms and rate constants. The rate constants for incorporation of CaCO{sub 3}{sup 0}(aq) at the mineral surface are 55 to 270 times higher than for MnCO{sub 3}{sup 0}(aq). This difference can not likely be explained by the water exchange rates, but may be due to the fact that ligand exchange mechanisms for Ca and Mn differ.","","","","","","United States","1999-01-01T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: Geochimica et Cosmochimica Acta; Journal Volume: 63; Journal Issue: 2; Other Information: PBD: Jan 1999","","Medium: X; Size: pp. 217-225","","","","Journal ID: GCACAK; ISSN 0016-7037; TRN: IM9923%%477","10.1016/S0016-7037(99)00026-5","","2009-12-16T00:00:00Z","347939","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/347939","","Geochimica et Cosmochimica Acta","2","63"
"Reevaluation of plate motion models based on hotspot tracks in the Atlantic and Indian Oceans","Baksi, A K","15 GEOTHERMAL ENERGY; 58 GEOSCIENCES; INDIAN OCEAN; ATLANTIC OCEAN; PLATE TECTONICS; HOT SPOTS; MATHEMATICAL MODELS; GEOLOGIC HISTORY; ISOTOPE DATING; MOTION","Plate motion models based on hotspot tracks in the Atlantic and Indian Oceans predict minimal movement (less than a few millimeters per year) between these hotspots and their counterparts in the Pacific Ocean for the past {approximately}100 m.yr., whereas plate circuit exercises indicate relative motions of {approximately}20 mm/yr. Hotspot-based models also suggest that the Rajmahal Traps, India, were located {approximately}1,000 km away from the Kerguelen hotspot at {approximately}115 Ma, and the Deccan Traps, India, were located a similar distance from the Reunion hotspot at {approximately}65 Ma; this is at odds with conclusions derived from paleomagnetism, plate circuits, and geochemical parameters that suggest a genetic link between flood basalt provinces in India and hotspots in the Indian Ocean. These divergent views may be explained by plume action {approximately}1,000 km from its center or errors in the hotspot motion models. The latter hypothesis is scrutinized in this article by examination of the radiometric ages for hotspot tracks in the Atlantic and Indian Oceans. The {sup 40}/{sup 39}Ar step-heating data for rocks defining the tracks of the Reunion and Kerguelen hotspots in the Indian Ocean and the Great Metero and Tristan da Cunha hotspots in the Atlantic Ocean are critically reexamined. Of {approximately}35 such ages utilized for deriving plate motion models for the past 130 m.yr., at best, only three ({approximately}32, {approximately}50, and {approximately}52 Ma) in the Indian Ocean and one ({approximately}65 Ma) for the Atlantic Ocean may be treated as crystallization ages. Conclusions based on hotspot track modeling for Late Cretaceous to Eocene time are suspect, and those for the Early to Late Cretaceous period are untenable. In the absence of precise age data for the tracks of hotspots in the Atlantic and Indian Oceans, and inconsistent age progressions noted within a single volcanic chain, plate circuit models serve as the superior technique for tracing plate motions over the past {approximately}100 m.yr. The degree of (absolute) motion for hotspots remains contentious. For most hotspots, models indicating detectable movement (>20 mm/yr) for the past {approximately}100 m.yr. are favored; the Kerguelen plume was situated close to its current position (49{degree}S) at {approximately}115 Ma.","","","","USDOE","","United States","1999-01-01T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: Journal of Geology; Journal Volume: 107; Journal Issue: 1; Other Information: PBD: Jan 1999","","Medium: X; Size: pp. 13-26","","","","Journal ID: JGEOAZ; ISSN 0022-1376; TRN: IM9919%%159","10.1086/314329","","2016-05-25T00:00:00Z","338543","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/338543","","Journal of Geology","1","107"

The authors examine the dynamics of such evolution for several geologically relevant permeability distributions (models for en-echelon cracks, an isolated sloping fractured zone, and two sloping high-permeability zones that are close enough together to interact). Although the focus is on a simple quartz matrix system, generic features emerge from this study that can aid in the broader goal of understanding the long-term feedback between flow and chemistry, where dissolution and precipitation is under kinetic control. Examples of thermal convection in a porous medium with spatially variable permeability reveal features of central importance to water-rock interaction. After a transient phase, an accelerated rate of change of porosity may be used with care to decrease computational time, as an alternative to the quasi-stationary state approximation (Lichtner, 1988). Kinetic effects produce features not expected by traditional assumptions made on the basis of equilibrium, for example, that cooling fluids are oversaturated and heating fluids are undersaturated with respect to silicic acid equilibrium. Indeed, the authors observe regions of downwelling oversaturated fluid experiencing heating and regions of upwelling, yet cooling, undersaturated fluid. When oscillatory convection is present, the amplitudes of oscillation generally increase with time in near-surface environments, whereas amplitudes tend to decrease over long times near the heated lower boundary. The authors examine the scaling behavior of characteristic length scales, of terms in the solute equation, and of the typical deviation from equilibrium, each as a function of the kinetic rate parameters.","","","","USDOE","","United States","1999-01-01T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: American Journal of Science; Journal Volume: 299; Journal Issue: 1; Other Information: PBD: Jan 1999","","Medium: X; Size: pp. 1-68","","","","Journal ID: AJSCAP; ISSN 0002-9599; TRN: 99:005827","10.2475/ajs.299.1.1","","2016-05-30T00:00:00Z","338542","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/338542","","American Journal of Science","1","299"

The analyses were conducted on site, using ion chromatography for thiosulfate, polythionate, and sulfate, and using colorimetry for dissolved sulfide. Thiosulfate was detected at concentrations typically less than 2 {micro}mol/L in neutral and alkaline chloride springs with low sulfate concentrations (Cl{sup {minus}}/SO{sub 4}{sup 2{minus}} > 25). The thiosulfate concentration levels are about one to two orders of magnitude lower than the concentration of dissolved sulfide in these springs. In most acid sulfate and acid sulfate-chloride springs (Cl{sup {minus}}/SO{sub 4}{sup 2{minus}} < 10), thiosulfate concentrations were also typically lower than 2 {micro}mol/L. However, in some chloride springs enriched with sulfate (Cl{sup {minus}}/SO{sub 4}{sup 2{minus}} between 10 and 25), thiosulfate was found at concentrations ranging from 9 to 95 {micro}mol/L, higher than the concentrations of dissolved sulfide in these waters. Polythionate was detected only in Cinder Pool, Norris Geyser basin, at concentrations up to 8 {micro}mol/L, with an average S-chain-length from 4.1 to 4.9 sulfur atoms. The results indicate that no thiosulfate occurs in the deeper parts of the hydrothermal system. Thiosulfate may form, however, from (1) hydrolysis of native sulfur by hydrothermal solutions in the shallower parts (<50 m) of the system, (2) oxidation of dissolved sulfide upon mixing of a deep hydrothermal water with aerated shallow groundwater, and (3) the oxidation of dissolved sulfide by dissolved oxygen upon discharge of the hot spring. Upon discharge of a sulfide-containing hydrothermal water, oxidation proceeds rapidly as atmospheric oxygen enters the water. The transfer of oxygen is particularly effective if the hydrothermal discharge is turbulent and has a large surface area.","","","","","","United States","1998-12-01T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: Geochimica et Cosmochimica Acta; Journal Volume: 62; Journal Issue: 23-34; Other Information: PBD: Dec 1998","","Medium: X; Size: pp. 3729-3743","","","","Journal ID: GCACAK; ISSN 0016-7037; TRN: IM9921%%217","10.1016/S0016-7037(98)00269-5","","2009-12-16T00:00:00Z","343753","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/343753","","Geochimica et Cosmochimica Acta","23-34","62"

The world direct-use energy production is about 37 TWh/a (installed capacity of 10,000 MWt in nearly forty countries), and is, with the exception of China, mainly in the industrialized, and central and eastern European countries. Fourteen countries have installed capacities over 100 MWt. The main uses are space heating (33%), heat pumps (12%) for heating and cooling, bathing (19%), greenhouses (14%), aquaculture (11%) and industry (10%). The application of the ground-source heat pump opens a new dimension in the scope for using the earth`s heat, as heat pumps can be used basically everywhere and are not site specific as conventional geothermal resources. Geothermal energy, with its proven technology and abundant resources, can make a very significant contribution towards reducing the emission of greenhouse gases worldwide.

Geothermal investigations for Akranes started as early as around 1950; but in spite of several attempts, a geothermal field, which could be utilized economically, was not found for a long period. After the increase in oil prices in the early 1970s, further studies were carried out. On the basis of the results of those studies, it was decided to build a combined district heating system for Akranes, Borgarnes, Hvanneyri (agricultural school) and some farms in the Borgarfjordur region. The water is piped from the hot spring Deildartunga, which is one of the largest hot springs in the world. Besides that, the system utilizes two wells at the farm Baer. The utilization of the hot spring makes the system different from most other district heating systems in Iceland, which are based on water from wells. Akranes and Borgarfjordur District Heating System was established in 1979. Before that time, space heating in this area was both by oil (93%) and electricity (7%). The system has now been split into three companies: one that is responsible for all the hot water production and transmission, and one district heating system for each of the two communities.","","","","","","United States","1998-12-01T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: Geo-Heat Center Quarterly Bulletin; Journal Volume: 19; Journal Issue: 4; Other Information: PBD: Dec 1998","","Medium: X; Size: pp. 10-13","","","","Journal ID: GCQBDW; ISSN 0276-1084; TRN: IM9907%%93","","","2009-12-16T00:00:00Z","308167","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/308167","","Geo-Heat Center Quarterly Bulletin","4","19"

The extreme variability of heat flow is explained by conductive heating immediately adjacent to vents and shallow circulation within sediments above the reservoir. This secondary circulation is hydrologically separated from the deeper system feeding the vents by a shallow conductive lid within the sediments. A similar separation of shallow and deep circulation may also occur at sediment-free ridge-crest hydrothermal environments.","","","","","","United States","1998-12-01T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: Geology; Journal Volume: 26; Journal Issue: 12; Other Information: PBD: Dec 1998","","Medium: X; Size: pp. 1115-1118","","","","Journal ID: GLGYBA; ISSN 0091-7613; TRN: IM9908%%367","10.1130/0091-7613(1998)026<1115:FSHFSH>2.3.CO;2","","2009-12-16T00:00:00Z","316286","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/316286","","Geology","12","26"

Cook-Austral islands include a variety of disparate geomorphic types: volcanic islands without reefs, with fringing reefs, and with barrier reefs enclosing shallow lagoons, low-lying atolls; and makatea islands composted of volcanic cores surrounded by annular limestone tablelands. The distribution of subsided and uplifted islands along the Cook-Austral chain reflects multiple hotspot activity, probably related to multiple mantle diapirs of local character rather than to deep-seated plumes. Rapid Pacific plate motion can generate elongate hotspot tracks from transient hotspot activity unrelated to columnar advective plumes.","","","","USDOE","","United States","1998-12-01T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: International Geology Review; Journal Volume: 40; Journal Issue: 12; Other Information: PBD: Dec 1998","","Medium: X; Size: pp. 1039-1075","","","","Journal ID: IGREAP; ISSN 0020-6814; TRN: IM9908%%436","10.1080/00206819809465254","","2016-05-19T00:00:00Z","316354","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/316354","","International Geology Review","12","40"

This is the maximum flow permitted, so as not to influence the springs and wells at the spa about 1 km away. For this reason, the flow is monitored carefully by the state. A second geothermal well at 52 C and 1,500 meters deep is used only as an observation well. Cold water, which is heated by the geothermal water, is pumped from wells near the Turiec River 1.8 km away at 8 to 12 C, depending upon the season, for use in the various holding or raising tanks.

Experiments were conducted with muscovite, kaolinite, and quartz or amorphous silica in 2M KCl solutions for 43 to 176 d. Post-experiment solution compositions lie either within the illite(0.88 K) stability field or on the illite(0.88 K)-kaolinite or illite(0.88 K)-diaspore univariant boundaries in log (a{sub K}{sup +}/a{sub H}{sup +}) vs. log a{sub H{sub 4}SiO{sub 4}} activity space. Transmission electron microscopy (TEM) observations of muscovite grain edges reveal the neoformation of illite crystals with a range of compositions (ATEM) from 0.31 to 0.89 K/O{sub 10}(OH){sub 2}. The range of K-contents appears to narrow toward 0.88 K/O{sub 10}(OH){sub 2} with increased experiment duration. HRTEM suggests the presence of 2 to 11 layer fundamental particles composed of illitic layers with 10 A periodicity. Fundamental particle thicknesses increase toward an average of 8 layers/particle with increased experiment duration. In the longer duration experiments, fundamental particle thicknesses were normally distributed about thicknesses of 4 and 8 layers, whereas fundamental particles with thicknesses <4 layers were common in a shorter duration experiment. The compositions and structure of the illites are consistent with the multiphase model, which states that the smectite-to-illite transition occurs through the step-wise formation of solubility-controlling phases consisting of fundamental particles with thicknesses of 1, 2, 4, and {le}8 layers. The increase in K-content and fundamental particle thickness with the extent of reaction suggests that the illite crystals underwent a prograde reaction culminating in the formation of end-member illite [0.88 K/O{sub 10}(OH){sub 2}]. This reaction, in conjunction with the previously observed, retrograde reaction from muscovite to end-member illite, demonstrates the stability of end-member illite in the system K{sub 2}O-Al{sub 2}O{sub 3}-SiO{sub 2}H{sub 2}O at 250 C.","","","","USDOE, Washington, DC (United States)","","United States","1998-11-01T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: American Mineralogist; Journal Volume: 83; Journal Issue: 11-12Pt1; Other Information: PBD: Nov-Dec 1998","","Medium: X; Size: pp. 1199-1208","","","","Journal ID: AMMIAY; ISSN 0003-004X; TRN: IM9921%%220","10.2138/am-1998-11-1208","","2016-05-26T00:00:00Z","343756","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/343756","","American Mineralogist","11-12Pt1","83"

This methodology has been applied to the Alhama Aquifer, which is the origin of the most important thermal springs of the Iberian Peninsula. A conceptual model was made of the aquifer by integrating data such as (1) the geometry at depth (on the basis of deep geophysics) and at the surface (from conventional geological maps); (2) hydrographic analysis of the aquifer discharge; (3) a study of the recharge by classic hydrometeorological methods; and (4) conventional and isotopic hydrochemistry. In addition to the hydraulic regional parameters it provides, the model explains the origin of the Alhama springs in terms of simple circulation at a depth of some 900 m and a normal geothermal gradient (3 C/100 m), with no requirement of contact with a source of heat at the bottom of the aquifer.","","","","USDOE","","United States","1998-11-01T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: Ground Water; Journal Volume: 36; Journal Issue: 6; Other Information: PBD: Nov-Dec 1998","","Medium: X; Size: pp. 913-923","","","","Journal ID: GRWAAP; ISSN 0017-467X; TRN: IM9904%%17","10.1111/j.1745-6584.1998.tb02098.x","","2016-05-27T00:00:00Z","302229","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/302229","","Ground Water","6","36"

Such precision is essential in a wide range of geophysical problems, including hydrocarbon exploration, geothermal reservoir characterization, or detection of discontinuities in coal beds. A processing method for three-component wide-band crosshole seismic data is presented. It is based on the observed phenomena of a decrease in the coherency between the coda waves recorded by closely spaced sensors or exited by closely spaced seismic sources. The authors transfer signals to the time-frequency domain and compute the instantaneous coherency at each moment of time between signals propagated on adjacent raypaths. /As a result, the authors obtain the distribution of the high-coherency time-frequency areas connected with coherent components of the signal. They can then see different modes of the recorded seismic signal and identify them as direct P- and S-waves, reflected waves, and converted tube waves. A reliable method of evaluation of the onset`s time for different modes of the seismic signal is also proposed. The technique has good resolution and allows separation of even very closely spaced wavefield components.","","","","USDOE","","United States","1998-11-01T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: Geophysics; Journal Volume: 63; Journal Issue: 6; Other Information: PBD: Nov-Dec 1998","","Medium: X; Size: pp. 1847-1857","","","","Journal ID: GPYSA7; ISSN 0016-8033; TRN: IM9908%%335","10.1190/1.1444477","","2016-05-17T00:00:00Z","316254","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/316254","","Geophysics","6","63"

A deep drill hole, WD-1, reached a depth of 3,729 m in July 1995 by applying the latest drilling techniques, such as a top-drive drilling system, enabling the collection of highly valuable information for understanding the characteristics of deep geothermal systems. Side-track drilling of WD-1 was started from a depth of 2,200 m in September 1996, targeting productive fractures expected near the boundary of the granite in a depth range from 2,800 to 3,000 m.

"Origin of platy calcite crystals in hot-spring deposits in the Kenya Rift Valley","Jones, B; Renault, R W","15 GEOTHERMAL ENERGY; 36 MATERIALS SCIENCE; KENYA; HOT SPRINGS; CALCITE; ORIGIN; RIFT ZONES; CRYSTAL STRUCTURE","Platy calcite crystals, which have their c axis parallel to their shortest length axis, are common components of travertine deposits found around some hot springs in the Kenya Rift Valley. They are composite crystals formed of numerous paper-thin subcrystals. Individual plates allowed to grow without obstruction develop a hexagonal motif. The Kenyan crystals typically form in hot (>75 C) waters that have a low Ca content (<10 mg/l), a high CO{sub 2} content, and a high rate of CO{sub 2} degassing. At Chemurkeu, aggregates of numerous small platy crystals collectively form lattice crystals that superficially resemble ray crystals. The walls of the lattice crystals are formed of large platy crystals that have their long and intermediate length axes aligned parallel to the plane of the long axis of the lattice crystal. Internally, the lattice crystals are formed of small platy calcite crystals arranged in a boxlike pattern that creates the appearance of a lattice when viewed in thin section. Lattice crystals are highly porous, with each pore being enclosed by platy crystals. At Lorusio, travertines are mainly formed of pseudodentrites that are constructed by numerous small platy crystals attached to a main stem which is a large platy crystal that commonly curves along its long axis. The pseudodentrites are the main construction blocks in ledges and lilypads that form in the vent pool and spring outflow channels, where the water is too hot for microbes other than hyperthermophiles. The platy calcite crystals in the Kenyan travertines are morphologically similar to platy calcite crystals that form as scale in pipes in the geothermal fields of New Zealand and hydrothermal angel wing calcite from the La Fe mine in Mexico. Comparison of the Kenyan and New Zealand crystals indicates that platy calcite crystals form from waters with a low Ca{sup 2+} content and a high CO{sub 3}/Ca ratio due to rapid rates of CO{sub 2} degassing.","","","","USDOE","","United States","1998-09-01T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: Journal of Sedimentary Research, Section A: Sedimentary Petrology and Processes; Journal Volume: 68; Journal Issue: 5; Other Information: PBD: Sep 1998","","Medium: X; Size: pp. 913-927","","","","Journal ID: JSRAEA; ISSN 1073-130X; TRN: IM9901%%74","10.2110/jsr.68.913","","2016-05-13T00:00:00Z","289447","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/289447","","Journal of Sedimentary Research, Section A: Sedimentary Petrology and Processes","5","68"

"Tectonic controls on magmatism in The Geysers--Clear Lake region: Evidence from new geophysical models","Stanley, W D; Benz, H M; Villasenor, A; Rodriguez, B D; Walters, M A","15 GEOTHERMAL ENERGY; GEYSERS GEOTHERMAL FIELD; MAGMATISM; GEOLOGIC MODELS; TECTONICS; CONTINENTAL CRUST; HEAT SOURCES","In order to study magmatism and geothermal systems in the Geysers-Clear Lake region, the authors developed a detailed three-dimensional tomographic velocity model based on local earthquakes. This high-resolution model resolves the velocity structure of the crust in the region to depths of approximately 12 km. The most significant velocity contrasts in The Geysers-Clear Lake region occur in the steam production area, where high velocities are associated with a Quaternary granite pluton, and in the Mount Hannah region, where low velocities occur in a 5-km-thick section of Mesozoic argillites. In addition, a more regional tomographic model was developed using traveltimes from earthquakes covering most of northern California. This regional model sampled the whole crust, but at a lower resolution than the local model. No large silicic magma chamber is noted in either the local or regional tomographic models. A three-dimensional gravity model also has ben developed in the area of the tomographic imaging. The gravity model demonstrates that all density contrasts can be accounted for in the upper 5--7 km of the crust. Two-dimensional magnetotelluric models of data from a regional east-west profile indicate high resistivities associated with the granitic pluton in The Geysers production area and low resistivities in the low-velocity section of Mesozoic argillites near Mount Hannah. No indication of midcrustal magma bodies is present in the magnetotelluric data. The geophysical models, seismicity patterns, distribution of volcanic vents, heat flow, and other data indicate that small, young intrusive bodies that were injected along a northeast trend from The Geysers to Clear Lake probably control the thermal regime.","","","","USDOE Assistant Secretary for Energy Efficiency and Renewable Energy, Washington, DC (United States); Department of the Interior, Washington, DC (United States)","","United States","1998-09-01T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: Geological Society of America, Bulletin; Journal Volume: 110; Journal Issue: 9; Other Information: PBD: Sep 1998","","Medium: X; Size: pp. 1193-1207","","","AC07-94ID13223","Journal ID: BUGMAF; ISSN 0016-7606; TRN: IM9831%%195","10.1130/0016-7606(1998)110<1193:TCOMIT>2.3.CO;2","","2009-12-16T00:00:00Z","669934","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/669934","","Geological Society of America, Bulletin","9","110"
"Natural convection below a downward facing heated horizontal surface in a fluid-saturated porous medium","Angirasa, D; Peterson, G P","15 GEOTHERMAL ENERGY; NATURAL CONVECTION; GEOTHERMAL SYSTEMS; POROUS MATERIALS; NUMERICAL ANALYSIS; PRESSURE GRADIENTS","Natural convection heat transfer from a horizontal surface facing upward or downward situated in a vast fluid-saturated porous medium is one of the fundamental problems studied for better understanding of transport phenomena in geothermal energy systems. Here, the nature of natural convection under a downward facing horizontal surface in a vast fluid-saturated porous medium is numerically studied. The two-dimensional flow is considered to be symmetric about the mid-vertical plane under the surface, and numerical calculations are presented for one half of the domain. The flow and thermal fields demonstrate no boundary layer behavior, and hence similarity and integral analyses are not possible. A layer of thermally stratified fluid grows under the central region of the surface, which inhibits flow. Convection picks up toward the edges of the surface, where the heat transfer rates are consequently high. The average Nusselt number (based on the total length of the surface) is correlated as Nu = 1.142Ra{sup 0.37} in the range 30 {le} Ra {le} 1,000.

The combined effect of Rayleigh number and thermal stratification on the global heat flux in porous cavities of varying aspect ratios has been analyzed. It is observed that the global heat flux (1) decreases with increasing values of the thermal stratification b and (2) increases with increasing values of Rayleigh number Ra. However, the cumulative heat flux along the midsegment of the vertical wall increases with increasing b and decreases with Ra. With increasing b, a reduction in the convection zone with a downward drift is noticed. Global heat flux can be boosted by reducing the width L of the cavity by a factor of {approximately}8 or more. The flow field and the heat transfer results are presented through the streamlines, isotherms, and global heat flux plots.","","","","USDOE","","United States","1998-08-28T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: Numerical Heat Transfer.

"Hydrothermal gas equilibria: The H{sub 2}O-H{sub 2}-CO{sub 2}-CO-CH{sub 4} system","Chiodini, G; Marini, L","15 GEOTHERMAL ENERGY; GAS ANALYSIS; WATER VAPOR; HYDROGEN; CARBON DIOXIDE; CARBON MONOXIDE; METHANE; FUMAROLIC FLUIDS; NATURAL STEAM; EQUILIBRIUM","The difficulty in measuring reservoir gas concentrations in geothermal systems often forces the use of gas ratios in a separated vapor phase to investigate reservoir conditions. Measured CO/CO{sub 2} and H{sub 2}/H{sub 2}O ratios of fumarolic fluids and vapors from geothermal wells representative of twenty-two different hydrothermal systems are consistent with theoretical values obtained from either of two commonly used redox buffers, indicating that CO and H{sub 2} attain chemical equilibrium in the hydrothermal reservoir. Use of different f{sub O{sub 2}}-buffers has little effect on these functions. Since CH{sub 4}/CO{sub 2} ratios are strongly affected by redox conditions in the gas equilibration zone, this disagreement between measured and theoretical values likely indicates that either no unique f{sub O{sub 2}}-buffer is active in all the hydrothermal environments or that CH{sub 4} is not in equilibrium with the other gases. The CO/CO{sub 2}, H{sub 2}/H{sub 2}O, and H{sub 2}/CO ratios in the hypothetical single saturated vapor phase were calculated and used to investigate f{sub O{sub 2}} and f{sub CO{sub 2}} distributions in the considered twenty-two hydrothermal systems. Recalculated f{sub CO{sub 2}} values are generally consistent, within one-half log-unit, with the full equilibrium function of Giggenbach (1984, 1988) although production of thermometamorphic CO{sub 2} might locally take place. It is evident that no unique f{sub O{sub 2}}-buffer is active in all the hydrothermal environments. This fact imply that CH{sub 4} could have attained chemical equilibrium with other gas species in the H{sub 2}O-H{sub 2}-CO{sub 2}-CO-CH{sub 4} system.","","","","","","United States","1998-08-01T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: Geochimica et Cosmochimica Acta; Journal Volume: 62; Journal Issue: 15; Other Information: PBD: Aug 1998","","Medium: X; Size: pp. 2673-2687","","","","Journal ID: GCACAK; ISSN 0016-7037; TRN: IM9901%%73","10.1016/S0016-7037(98)00181-1","","2009-12-16T00:00:00Z","289446","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/289446","","Geochimica et Cosmochimica Acta","15","62"

Estimates are based on a critical review of data from the literature at 25 C and 1 bar. The combined data for 14 minerals, 6 cations, and 56 aqueous complexes provide a foundation for quantitative predictions of aqueous speciation of these platinum group elements (PGE), as well as platinum group mineral (PGM) solubilities as functions of pH, oxidation state, and chloride and sulfate content of geologic fluids at temperatures to 1000 C and pressures to 5 kbar. Therefore, these estimates are the first to address PGE speciation at the pressure and temperatures of most PGM deposits. Comparisons are made to other theoretical predictions of platinum-group element (PGE) complex formation in aqueous solutions and to pertinent experimental data. The authors conclude that Pd-chloride complexes may be less stable at lower temperatures than previously predicted by other investigators, but that Pt-chloride complexes may be considerably more stable.","","","","","","United States","1998-08-01T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: Geochimica et Cosmochimica Acta; Journal Volume: 62; Journal Issue: 15; Other Information: PBD: Aug 1998","","Medium: X; Size: pp. 2643-2671","","","","Journal ID: GCACAK; ISSN 0016-7037; TRN: IM9901%%72","10.1016/S0016-7037(98)00049-0","","2009-12-16T00:00:00Z","289445","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/289445","","Geochimica et Cosmochimica Acta","15","62"

Experiments were carried out at temperatures between 50 and 290 C and pressures up to 200 bars. The experimentally determined concentrations of sulfur in the gas phase are 6--7 orders of magnitude higher than the corresponding concentrations calculated for a system free of hydrogen sulfide. The results of experiments show significant interaction between S and H{sub 2}S. These interactions can be of two kind: solvation by hydrogen sulfide (solubility), as with formation of new stable gaseous chemical compounds, like polysulfanes (chemical reaction). The data obtained can be reasonably well described by the formation of a H{sub 2}S {center_dot} S compound. Thermodynamic parameters for polysulfanes and equilibrium compositions of the S-H{sub 2}S system have been calculated ab initio for the experimental conditions. At temperatures above 170 C, results (of calculations) are in good agreement with experimental data, although the difference between the calculated and experimental mole fraction of the sulfur in the gas phase reaches 2 orders of magnitude at 125--170 C. It is theorized that sulfur solubility in gaseous H{sub 2}S is related to two main chemical reactions, dominated in the different temperature ranges: sulfur solvation by H{sub 2}S (125--170C) and polysulfane formation (200--290 C).","","","","","","United States","1998-08-01T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: Geochimica et Cosmochimica Acta; Journal Volume: 62; Journal Issue: 15; Other Information: PBD: Aug 1998","","Medium: X; Size: pp. 2627-2635","","","","Journal ID: GCACAK; ISSN 0016-7037; TRN: IM9901%%70","10.1016/S0016-7037(98)00188-4","","2009-12-16T00:00:00Z","289460","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/289460","","Geochimica et Cosmochimica Acta","15","62"

The objective of the seismic survey was to estimate the depth and continuity of a basalt and rhyolite volcanic sequence. Well siting was based on geothermal aquifer depth, location of interpreted faults, projected thermal impact of injection on existing wells, surface pipe extension costs, and public land availability. Seismic acquisition tests and careful processing were used to ensure high-quality data while minimizing the potential for damage along city streets. A video camera placed in a sewer and a blast vibration monitor were used to confirm that energy from the seismic source (a 75-in{sup 3} land air gun) did not damage nearby buildings, street surfaces, or buried utilities along the survey lines. Walkaway seismic tests were also used to compare signal quality of the air-gun source to an explosive source for imaging targets up to 800 m depth. These tests show less signal bandwidth from the air-gun source compared to the buried explosive source, but the air-gun signal quality was adequate to meet imaging objectives. Seismic reflection results show that the top of this rhyolite/basalt sequence dips ({approximately}8--1{degree}) southwest away from the Boise foothills at depths of 200 to 800 m. Seismic methods enabled interpretation of aquifer depths along the profiles and located fault zones where injected water may encounter fracture permeability and optimally benefit the existing producing system.

Based on a fixed-grid Eulerian description, the classical SOLA-VOF method is largely extended to incorporate, for example, three incompressible fluids and liquid-vapor phase change. The thorough validation and assessment process covers several benchmark simulations, some which are presented, documenting the multipurpose value of the new code. The direct-contact evaporation simulations reveal severe numerical problems that are closely related to the fixed-grid Euler formulation. As a consequence, the comparison to experiments have to be limited to the initial stage. Potential applications using several design variations can be found in waste heat recovery and reactor cooling. Furthermore, direct contact evaporators may be used in such geothermal power plants where the brines cannot be directly fed into a turbine either because of a high salt load causing severe fouling and corrosion or because of low steam fraction.","","","","Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft, Bonn (Germany)","","United States","1998-05-08T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: Numerical Heat Transfer.

Originally, the system was used mostly for offshore and higher cost land drilling, and it had to be installed as a permanent installation because of its enormous weight and size. Essentially, a top drive replaces the kelly and rotary table as the means of rotating drillpipe on oil, gas and geothermal rigs and is considered to be 15% to 40% more efficient than a kelly drive. Top drive systems allow the operator to drill and maintain directional orientation for triple stands and provide tripping efficiency because of the ability to ream and circulate with triple stands, to reduce the risk of stuck pipe or lost wells, and to improve well control and pipe handling safety. The paper describes electric top drives with DC motors, top drives with AC motors, top drives with permanent magnet motors, and top drives with permanent magnet brushless synchronous motors.","","","","","","United States","1998-05-01T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: Petroleum Engineer International; Journal Volume: 71; Journal Issue: 5; Other Information: PBD: May 1998","","Medium: X; Size: pp. 45-48","","","","Journal ID: PEEID4; ISSN 0164-8322; TRN: IM9817%%167","","","2009-12-16T00:00:00Z","616284","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/616284","","Petroleum Engineer International","5","71"
"Onset of natural convection in a fluid-saturated porous medium inside a cylindrical enclosure bottom heated by constant flux","Wang, C Y","32 ENERGY CONSERVATION, CONSUMPTION, AND UTILIZATION; 15 GEOTHERMAL ENERGY; NATURAL CONVECTION; POROUS MATERIALS; THERMAL INSULATION; SATURATION; GEOTHERMAL ENERGY","The study of buoyancy-driven natural convection in fluid-saturated porous media is important in thermal insulation design and geothermal energy utilization. For a porous layer heated from below, the heat transfer is through conduction only if the Rayleigh number is lower than a critical value R{sub c}. Above this critical value convection sets in and the heat transfer is dramatically increased. For an unbounded layer under isothermal boundary conditions Horton and Rogers found R{sub c} to be 4{pi}{sup 2}. However, if the region is bounded, such as in an enclosure, R{sub c} is increased, although not monotonically, as the size of the enclosure is decreased. For a rectangular box Beck found R{sub c} and the corresponding three dimensional convection modes are quite sensitive to the dimensions of the box. Zebib studied the convective stability of a finite cylindrical enclosure and found the incipient convection is truly three-dimensional. In most cases the preferred convection modes are not axisymmetric even for an axisymmetric geometry. The previous literature on convective instability all studied constant temperature boundary conditions on the top and bottom surfaces. The present note considers the case where the bottom surface has a constant heat flux condition. This important situation occurs when the bottom is heated by say, electric heating elements. The authors study the cylindrical enclosure with insulated sidewalls.","","","","","","United States","1998-05-01T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: International Communications in Heat and Mass Transfer; Journal Volume: 25; Journal Issue: 4; Other Information: PBD: May 1998","","Medium: X; Size: pp. 593-598","","","","Journal ID: IHMTDL; ISSN 0735-1933; TRN: IM9820%%85","10.1016/S0735-1933(98)00046-3","","2009-12-16T00:00:00Z","624118","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/624118","","International Communications in Heat and Mass Transfer","4","25"

The alkaline Na-HCO{sub 3}-Cl water, which discharged at 95 C with a flow rate of 10 l/s, flowed down a broad discharge apron into the Waikato River. The discharge apron was inhabited by thriving microbial communities that included Calothrix, Phormidium, and numerous Synechococcus. These microbes mediated the construction of columnar stromatolites around the edge of Ohaaki Pool, oncoids in the discharge channel, and intercalated stratiform stromatolites, Conophyton, and coccoid microbial mats on the distal part of the discharge apron. All the microbes were variably replaced and encrusted by amorphous silica while alive or shortly after death. Consequently, fabrics in the siliceous sinters around Ohaaki Pool are controlled by the growth patterns and composition of the microbial community. For example, the Calothrix-dominated community gave rise to stratiform stromatolites that are characterized by alternating erect and prostrate laminae. Conversely, the Synechococcus-dominated communities formed mats that produced dense, while siliceous laminae. The Phormidium-Synechococcus community constructed the Conophyton. Platy, skeletal, and blocky calcite crystals are found in, around, and between the siliceous stromatolites that formed around Ohaaki Pool, the proximal part of the discharge apron, and in the oncoids. Although minor calcite is found locally in the stratiform stromatolites on the discharge apron, there is no evidence that microbes played any role in calcite precipitation.","","","","USDOE","","United States","1998-05-01T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: Journal of Sedimentary Research, Section A: Sedimentary Petrology and Processes; Journal Volume: 68; Journal Issue: 3; Other Information: PBD: May 1998","","Medium: X; Size: pp. 413-434","","","","Journal ID: JSRAEA; ISSN 1073-130X; TRN: IM9819%%228","10.2110/jsr.68.413","","2016-04-21T00:00:00Z","619638","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/619638","","Journal of Sedimentary Research, Section A: Sedimentary Petrology and Processes","3","68"

It is a closed cycle utilizing an external heat source; thus application to solar, geothermal, and waste heat utilization may be possible. One aspect of implementing the cycle allows for a heat exchanger located outside the working volume of the engine. This would permit a much larger heat transfer area than current Stirling cycle engines can accommodate, thus leading to higher practical efficiency without the penalty of increasing the dead volume of the device. Expressions for the ideal thermal efficiency and maximum work output point are derived. Results show a lower ideal efficiency than the Carnot cycle for all relevant expansion ratios, although for moderate expansion ratios, the deviation is not large if the temperature ratio exceeds 3. Furthermore, the efficiency at which most engines operate, the so-called maximum work output point, is similar to that derived from finite-rate analysis of Otto and Brayton cycles.","","","","USDOE","","United States","1998-04-01T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: Energy Sources; Journal Volume: 20; Journal Issue: 3; Other Information: PBD: Apr 1998","","Medium: X; Size: pp. 199-208","","","","Journal ID: EGYSAO; ISSN 0090-8312; TRN: IM9817%%247","10.1080/00908319808970058","","2016-04-19T00:00:00Z","616364","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/616364","","Energy Sources","3","20"

Natural convection above a heated horizontal upward facing surface in a porous medium is one of the many fundamental problems being studied in geothermal heat transfer. A numerical study is presented of natural convection from a heated upward facing finite horizontal surface in a fluid-saturated porous medium. The Rayleigh number range for which two-dimensional flows occur is numerically determined as 40 {le} Ra {le} 600. At higher Rayleigh numbers the flow is shown to become three-dimensional with multiple plume formation and growth. At lower Rayleigh numbers the transport is dominated by conduction, and there is greater uncertainty in the numerical determination of heat transfer rates by convection models. For the two-dimensional flows the correlation for the Nusselt number is obtained as Nu = 3.092Ra{sup 0.272}. The fundamental physical mechanisms of convection in a vast porous medium are presented and explained with the aid of the numerical results.","","","","USDOE","","United States","1998-04-01T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: Numerical Heat Transfer.

Determination of the geometry and growth process of a hydraulic fracture zone is important for monitoring and assessing subsurface fractures. A relative-source-location approach, based on a waveform correlation and a grid search method, has been developed to estimate relative hypocenter locations for a cluster of 157 microearthquakes induced by hydraulic fracturing at the Los Alamos Hot Dry Rock (HDR) geothermal site. Among the 157 events, 147 microearthquakes occurred in a tight cluster with a dimension of 40 m, roughly defining a vertical hydraulic fracture zone with an orientation of N40{degree}W. The length, height, and width of the hydraulic fracture zone are estimated to be 40, 35, and 5 m, respectively. Analysis of the spatial-temporal pattern of the induced microearthquakes reveals that the fracture zone grew significantly, averaging 0.2m/ minute in a two-hour period toward the northwest along the fracture zone strike.","","","","USDOE, Washington, DC (United States)","","United States","1998-01-01T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: Geophysics; Journal Volume: 63; Journal Issue: 1; Other Information: PBD: Jan-Feb 1998","","Medium: X; Size: pp. 120-131","","","FG02-86ER13636","Journal ID: GPYSA7; ISSN 0016-8033; TRN: IM9814%%177","10.1190/1.1444304","","2009-12-16T00:00:00Z","599954","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/599954","","Geophysics","1","63"

Geothermal systems have a number of positive social characteristics (they are simple, safe, and adaptable systems with modular 1--50 MW [thermal (t) or electric (e)] plants capable of providing continuous baseload, load following, or peaking capacity) and benign environmental attributes (negligible emissions of CO{sub 2}, SO{sub x}, NO{sub x}, and particulates, and modest land and water use). Because these features are compatible with sustainable growth of global energy supplies in both developed and developing countries, geothermal energy is an attractive option to replace fossil and fissile fuels. In 1997, about 7,000 MWe of base-load generating capacity and over 15,000 MWt of heating capacity from high-grade geothermal resources are in commercial use worldwide. 114 refs., 6 figs., 4 tabs.","","","","","","United States","1997-12-31T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: Annual Review of Energy and the Environment; Journal Volume: 22; Other Information: PBD: 1997","","Medium: X; Size: pp. 305-356","","","","Journal ID: ANEEER; ISSN 1056-3466; TRN: 98:003359","10.1146/annurev.energy.22.1.305","","2009-12-16T00:00:00Z","566243","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/566243","","Annual Review of Energy and the Environment","","22"

A system to tap this potential and heat the Haakon School District buildings in Philip has been in operation since November 1980. Five school buildings having a total area of 44,000 ft{sup 2} (4088 ft{sup 2}) are heated with 157{degrees}F (69{degrees}C) water. A single well provides water at a maximum artesian flow of 340 gpm (21.5 L/s), which more than meets the heat demand of the school buildings. Eight buildings in the Philip business district utilize geothermal fluid discharged from the school for space heating. During the 1980-81 heating season, these buildings obtained 75% to 90% of their heat from geothermal fluid. Peak heat delivery of the system is 5.5 million Btu/h (1.61. MJ/s), with an annual energy delivery of 9.5 billion Btu (10 TJ). The geothermal system has operated nearly problem free with the exception of the equipment to remove Radium-226 from the spent fluid.

The surface is maintained at a uniform wall temperature (UWT) or uniform heat flux (UHF). The transformed governing equations are solved by Keller box method. Numerical data for the dimensionless temperature profiles and the local Nusselt number are presented for a wide range of the mass flux parameter. In general, it has been found that the local surface heat transfer rate increases owing to suction of fluid. This trend reversed for blowing of fluid. The mass flux parameter is found to have a more pronounced effect on the local Nusselt number for the case of UWT than it does for the case of UHF. Natural convection heat transfer in a saturated porous medium has a number of important engineering and geophysical applications, such as nuclear reactor cooling system and underground energy transport.","","","","","","United States","1997-12-01T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: International Communications in Heat and Mass Transfer; Journal Volume: 24; Journal Issue: 8; Other Information: PBD: Dec 1997","","Medium: X; Size: pp. 1195-1205","","","","Journal ID: IHMTDL; ISSN 0735-1933; TRN: 98:004663","10.1016/S0735-1933(97)00114-0","","2009-12-16T00:00:00Z","596777","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/596777","","International Communications in Heat and Mass Transfer","8","24"

Proper dimensionless parameters are employed for various thermal boundary conditions on the left and right walls of the channel prescribed as isothermal-isothermal, isothermal-isoflux, and isoflux-isothermal. Analytical expressions for the velocity and the temperature profiles in the channel as well as for the mass flow rate, friction factor, and heat carried out by the fluid in the channel are developed for special cases of the problem. Conditions for the occurrence of fluid backflow zones are reported. The fully nonlinear governing equations are solved numerically by an implicit finite difference method. Favorable comparisons with the developed analytical results and previously published work are performed. Graphical results of the closed-form and numerical results are reported for various parametric conditions to illustrate special features of the solution. Mixed convection flow of an electrically conducting and heat-generating/absorbing fluid in a porous medium channel in the presence of a magnetic field is of special technical significance because of its frequent occurrence in many industrial applications such as geothermal reservoirs, cooling of nuclear reactors, thermal insulation, and others.","","","","USDOE","","United States","1997-11-07T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: Numerical Heat Transfer.

"The self-potential method in the geothermal exploration of Greece","Apostolopoulos, G; Louis, I; Lagios, E","15 GEOTHERMAL ENERGY; GEOTHERMAL EXPLORATION; SELF-POTENTIAL SURVEYS; GREECE; DATA ANALYSIS; PERFORMANCE","Self-potential (SP) anomalies are generated by flows of fluid, heat, and ions in the earth. SP investigations have been used to locate and delineate sources associated with such flows in three areas of geothermal interest in Greece -- Lesvos Island, Loutra Hypatis (central Greece), and Nisyros Island. A combination of geophysical methods, with SP being the primary method, has been applied in these areas. The SP method is adversely influenced by various sources of noise. Field procedures have been suggested to minimize their effects by monitoring electrode polarization and telluric activity. The interpretation of SP contour maps is preferred to using profile data. A procedure was adopted for SP interpretation, and the results were satisfactory. However, this model is based on thermoelectric sources only and is not related directly to hot fluid movement. In all three survey areas, the geothermal zones delimited by the SP interpretation in combination with data acquired by other geophysical methods result in an integrated interpretation of the geothermal system. Since SP and very-low-frequency (VLF) anomalies can be generated by the same geological source (i.e., geothermal, highly conductive zone), the corresponding results are compared to provide a strong indication of the presence of geothermal zones. The activity of geothermal zones affects the conductivity of the surrounding medium, which also can be detected by dc resistivity and audiomagnetotelluric (AMT) methods. In addition, geothermal zones can be related to various interfaces or tectonic features that can be detected by gravity or seismic methods.","","","","","","United States","1997-11-01T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: Geophysics; Journal Volume: 62; Journal Issue: 6; Other Information: DN: Paper presented at the 64. annual international meeting, Society of Exploration Geophysicists; PBD: Nov-Dec 1997","","Medium: X; Size: pp. 1715-1723","","","","Journal ID: GPYSA7; ISSN 0016-8033; TRN: IM9812%%166","10.1190/1.1444271","","2009-12-16T00:00:00Z","597028","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/597028","","Geophysics","6","62"

This interest stems from numerous possible industrial and technological applications. Examples of some applications include geothermal reservoirs, drying of porous solids, heat exchanger design, petroleum production, filtration, chemical catalytic reactor, nuclear waste repositories, and geophysical flows. Here, continuum equations governing steady, laminar, buoyancy-induced flow and heat transfer of a power-law fluid over a horizontal surface immersed in a uniform porosity and permeability porous medium are developed. These partial differential equations are transformed into ordinary differential equations by using a general similarity transformation for variable surface temperature and constant heat flux cases. The resulting equations are solved numerically by an implicit finite-difference method. Numerical results for typical velocity and temperature profiles are presented and discussed.","","","","","","United States","1997-10-01T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: International Communications in Heat and Mass Transfer; Journal Volume: 24; Journal Issue: 6; Other Information: PBD: Oct 1997","","Medium: X; Size: pp. 805-814","","","","Journal ID: IHMTDL; ISSN 0735-1933; TRN: 97:017806","10.1016/S0735-1933(97)00067-5","","2009-12-16T00:00:00Z","531510","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/531510","","International Communications in Heat and Mass Transfer","6","24"

These parameters are used with standard state thermodynamic data at 25{degrees}C and 1 bar to calculate equilibrium constants for redox reactions among the four most common oxidation states of uranium (U(III), U(IV), U(V), and U(VI)), and their hydrolysis reactions at temperatures to 1000{degrees}C and pressures to 5 kb. A total of nineteen aqueous uranium species are included. The predicted equilibrium constants are used to construct oxidation potential-pH diagrams at elevated temperatures and pressures and to calculate the solubilities of uraninite as functions of temperature and pH, which are compared to experimental data. Oxidation potential-pH diagrams illustrate the relative stabilities of aqueous uranium species and indicate that U(IV) and U(VI) species predominate in aqueous solution in the U-O-H system. Increasing temperature stabilizes U(VI) and U(III) species relative to U(IV) species, but U(IV) species dominate at oxidation states consistent and mineral-buffer assemblages and near-neutral pH. At low pH, U(VI) is stabilized relative to U(IV) suggesting that uranium transport in hydrothermal systems requires either acidic solutions or potent complexes of U(IV). 40 refs., 15 figs., 3 tabs.","","","","","","United States","1997-10-01T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: Geochimica et Cosmochimica Acta; Journal Volume: 61; Journal Issue: 20; Other Information: PBD: Oct 1997","","Medium: X; Size: pp. 4245-4266","","","","Journal ID: GCACAK; ISSN 0016-7037; TRN: 98:001305-0001","10.1016/S0016-7037(97)00240-8","","2009-12-16T00:00:00Z","617815","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/617815","","Geochimica et Cosmochimica Acta","20","61"

"Water-rock interaction processes in the Triassic sandstone and the granitic basement of the Rhine Graben: Geochemical investigation of a geothermal reservoir","Aquilina, L; Pauwels, H; Genter, A; Fouillac, C","15 GEOTHERMAL ENERGY; 54 ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCES; ROCK-FLUID INTERACTIONS; TRIASSIC PERIOD; RHINE RIVER; RIFT ZONES; GEOCHEMISTRY; HOT-DRY-ROCK SYSTEMS; RESERVOIR FLUIDS; GEOTHERMOMETRY","Saline fluids have been collected in the Rhine Graben over the last two decades, both from the Triassic sandstone aquifer and the granitic basement down to a depth of 3500m. Their salinities and location are compared in order to distinguish the respective influences of temperature and host-rock mineralogy in the water-rock interaction processes. The comparison shows that sulphates in the sedimentary formations were dissolved by the fluids, which also led to Br enrichment. Mica dissolution has strongly increased the Rb and Cs contents, which then provide an indication of the degree of water-rock interaction. The Sr isotopic ratios are used to compare the fluids with the granite minerals. Two relationships are revealed for the fluids in the sandstone and the granite, one related to widespread mica dissolution, which could have affected both the Buntsandstein and the granite, and the other to subsequent plagioclase dissolution, which is observed only in the granite. Computations showed that 12.5g of mica and 1.65g of plagioclase per liter of fluid have been dissolved. The nature of these two relationships suggests two different evolutions for the fluids and the individualization of the two reservoirs during the graben`s history. The cation concentrations are mainly controlled by temperature, and are independent of the type of host rock. Equilibrium with the rock mainly caused Ca and K concentration variations, which has induced clear Ca-K and Ca-{delta}{sup 18}O, K-{delta}{sup 18}O correlations. Geothermometric computations indicate that with increasing depth, the cations, the silica and the {delta}{sup 18}O (SO{sub 4}) geothermometers evolve towards a value close to 230{degrees}C. This demonstrates the existence of a hot reservoir in the granite of the graben, at a depth estimated at 4.5-5 km. 59 refs., 11 figs., 6 tabs.","","","","","","United States","1997-10-01T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: Geochimica et Cosmochimica Acta; Journal Volume: 61; Journal Issue: 20; Other Information: PBD: Oct 1997","","Medium: X; Size: pp. 4281-4295","","","","Journal ID: GCACAK; ISSN 0016-7037; TRN: 98:001305-0002","10.1016/S0016-7037(97)00243-3","","2009-12-16T00:00:00Z","617816","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/617816","","Geochimica et Cosmochimica Acta","20","61"

The governing equations are solved numerically for small and large values of the Rayleigh number, and at small times, the results are found to be in very good agreement with the analytical solution as obtained by Pop et al., who uses the method of matched asymptotic expansions. A plume region develops at the top of the cylinder, and two counterrotating vortices form adjacent to the sides of the cylinder. A novel feature of the results is that as convection becomes increasingly more dominant, a single hot cell of fluid forms vertically above the cylinder and rapidly moves away from the cylinder as time increases. The hot cell of fluid occurs at smaller times and distances from the surface of the cylinder as the Rayleigh number increases. The numerical results indicate that the heat and flow penetrate farther upward into the porous media as time increases, whereas the conservation of energy principle shows that the heat penetrates infinitely into the porous media. At very large times the numerical results show reasonable agreement, in the vicinity of the cylinder,m with the steady state solution obtained by Ingham and Pop, which should only be considered as an inner solution to the problem.","","","","USDOE","","United States","1997-09-01T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: Numerical Heat Transfer.

In contrast to geothermal systems, where CO{sub 2} partial pressures approach equilibrium with respect to the conversion of Ca-Al-silicates to calcite and clay, absolute gas pressures in hydrocarbon reservoirs are governed by reservoir pressure. In high-heatflow, >80mW/m{sup 2}, sedimentary basins, CH{sub 4}, C{sub 2}H{sub 6}, and C{sub 3}H{sub 8} concentrations are controlled by a kinetic processes corresponding to random breakage of C-C bonds of more complex molecules. Short-distance variations in relative CH{sub 4} and CO{sub 2} contents of well discharges are largely due to underground vapor-liquid separation processes. The composition of gases from high-heatflow sedimentary basins suggests that they form in systems open to the escape of earlier formed products and to interaction with redox-active components of the host rock. In addition to oxidative degradation of organic material in contact with comparatively oxidising sedimentary material, interaction with highly reduced mafic rocks may give rise to reductive degradation or even synthesis of reduced C species. 89 refs., 16 figs., 1 tab.","","","","","","United States","1997-09-01T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: Geochimica et Cosmochimica Acta; Journal Volume: 61; Journal Issue: 17; Other Information: PBD: Sep 1997","","Medium: X; Size: pp. 3763-3785","","","","Journal ID: GCACAK; ISSN 0016-7037; TRN: 98:001182-0008","10.1016/S0016-7037(97)00171-3","","2009-12-16T00:00:00Z","585483","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/585483","","Geochimica et Cosmochimica Acta","17","61"

Published isopiestic molalities, direct vapor pressures, and emf results for CaCl{sub 2}(aq) have been critically reevaluated and recalculated in an internally consistent manner. This critically-assessed database was used to evaluate the parameters of Pitzer`s equations and various extended forms at 298.15 K and 0.1 MPa. Neither the standard equations nor empirically extended versions were able to represent the thermodynamic results over more than part of the molality range without large cyclic systematic deviations. It was possible, however, to obtain essentially quantitative agreement between experiment and model over the full molality range if (1) the presence of CaCl{sup +}(aq) ion pairs was included explicitly and (2) higher-order virial terms were included. One such quantitative model is presented here in detail. Without these higher-order virial terms the same model is able to represent the {phi}(CaCl{sub 2}) fairly well only to about 8 mol/kg. The osmotic coefficient of CaCl{sub 2}(aq) goes through a minimum around 0.11 mol/kg, which is followed by a regular increase with molality to a broad maximum in the supersaturated molality region where {phi}(CaCl{sub 2}) is nearly constant at 3.169--3.173 from about (8.5 to 9.5) mol/kg.

Corresponding log(D{sub 0}/r{sub 0}{sup 2}) values (5 {+-} 3 s{sup -1}) were highly correlated with E, yielding a slope that reproduces the previously documented feldspar compensation relationship. Numerical analysis of this correlation permits us to rule out large systematic laboratory errors in our data. In applying the multiple diffusion domain (MDD) model, we observed general tendencies in the domain distribution of basement K-feldspars. For the majority of samples, most {sup 39}Ar resides in the larger domains. The smallest domains generally constitute <5% volume fraction of the sample and tend to plot {approximately}2 orders of magnitude above log (D{sub 0}/r{sub 0}{sup 2}). Alternatively, the largest domains constrained by {sup 39}Ar released below melting have log (D/r{sup 2}) values that are typically {approximately}3 orders of magnitude smaller than log(D{sub 0}/r{sub 0}{sup 2}). Systematic analysis of the database demonstrates that the diffusion behavior predicted by the MDD model prevails for virtually all samples. 44 refs., 14 figs., 2 tabs.","","","","","","United States","1997-08-01T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: Geochimica et Cosmochimica Acta; Journal Volume: 61; Journal Issue: 15; Other Information: PBD: Aug 1997","","Medium: X; Size: pp. 3171-3192","","","","Journal ID: GCACAK; ISSN 0016-7037; TRN: 98:001178-0004","10.1016/S0016-7037(97)00147-6","","2009-12-16T00:00:00Z","585148","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/585148","","Geochimica et Cosmochimica Acta","15","61"

Economic incentives for slimhole, short-radius re-entry and multilateral wells have been well established, but until recently, the options for this kind of work have been limited. The increased use of coiled tubing has introduced additional challenges for motor manufacturers, with greater emphasis on shortness for ease of rig-up and steerability. These challenges are addressed by a unique new motor that promises benefits for coiled tubing drilling, re-entry work and multilateral drilling, as well as for geothermal wells.","","","","","","United States","1997-08-01T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: Petroleum Engineer International; Journal Volume: 70; Journal Issue: 8; Other Information: PBD: Aug 1997","","Medium: X; Size: pp. 31-34","","","","Journal ID: PEEID4; ISSN 0164-8322; TRN: IM9745%%283","","","2009-12-16T00:00:00Z","536444","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/536444","","Petroleum Engineer International","8","70"
"New technology improves cement-slurry design","","15 GEOTHERMAL ENERGY; GEOTHERMAL WELLS; CEMENTS; CEMENTING; WELL CASINGS; PERFORMANCE; RHEOLOGY; MATERIALS TESTING; FIELD TESTS","A promising geothermal concession is located in a tea plantation on the island of Java. A drilling project was undertaken to evaluate and harness this resource for geothermal electricity generation. The program used two slimhole rigs to drill appraisal wells to establish the potential of the field. Geothermal wells present the most severe conditions to which cements are exposed. As a result, their performance requirements are among the most stringent. Geothermal cements are usually designed to provide at least 1,000 psi compressive strength and no more than 1.0-md water permeability. While casings with tight annular clearances require that good cementing practices be observed, they also create conditions that demand much greater care and control in slurry and procedure design than regular casing cementation. Free-water and thickening-time requirements are similar for geothermal and slimhole conditions, but the use of perlite and silica flour complicate the rheology required for geothermal wells. The paper describes liquid-cement premix, applications, laboratory testing, field pilot testing, and field operations.","","","","","","United States","1997-08-01T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: JPT, Journal of Petroleum Technology; Journal Volume: 49; Journal Issue: 8; Other Information: PBD: Aug 1997","","Medium: X; Size: pp. 844-845","","","","Journal ID: JPTJAM; ISSN 0149-2136; TRN: IM9745%%340","","","2009-12-16T00:00:00Z","536501","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/536501","","JPT, Journal of Petroleum Technology","8","49"

Outstanding examples include heat pipes and capillary pumped loops, drying processes, heat and moisture transfer in insulation materials, high-level radioactive waste repositories, latent heat storage, and geothermal energy systems. This study aims at developing a general numerical formalism for efficient simulation of two-phase flow and heat transfer processes in porous media. These problems are characterized by the coexistence of a two-phase zone and single-phase regions with irregular and moving phase interfaces in between. Based on the two-phase mixture model previously developed by the present author and co-workers, a fixed-grid numerical formulation is presented in this article for general problems that may simultaneously include a superheated vapor region, a two-phase zone, and a subcooled liquid region in a single physical domain. The governing equations are solved numerically by two approaches, a pressure-based method and a primitive-variable method. Both methods yield equivalent performance, but the latter appears to offer more convenience and greater flexibility for a wide variety of problems. The present algorithm can be readily implemented into widely available single-phase computational fluid dynamics (CFD) codes. A sample simulation concerning two-phase boiling flow through a porous bed with heating from below is carried out to demonstrate the applicability and efficiency of the proposed formulation. Also, the numerical predictions are compared to available experimental observations with good agreement. The present algorithm provides a powerful, yet routine tool for the numerical modeling of complex two-phase transport processes in porous media.","","","","USDOE","","United States","1997-07-01T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: Numerical Heat Transfer.

This fast modeling method provides synthetic waveforms which include the effects of two borehole irregularities, diameter changes (washout), and formation property changes. The essential physics of the low-frequency Stoneley waves are captured with a simple 1-D model. A mass-balance boundary condition and a propagator matrix are used to express Stoneley-wave interactions with the borehole irregularities. The accuracy of the proposed method was confirmed through comparison with existing finite-difference and boundary integral modeling methods that yielded cross-correlations greater than 0.98. Comparison of synthetic records calculated for an actual borehole with field records showed qualitative agreement in the major reflections because of the washout zones, but showed some disagreements in the reflections caused by the fractures. Since the synthetic records include only information relating to the borehole geometry and the elastic properties of formation, the reflection caused by the fracture will appear only in the field record. These results suggest the possibility of distinguishing Stoneley-wave reflections caused by fractures from those caused by borehole irregularities. Further, the fast computational speed of this method--over 300 times faster than either boundary integral or finite-difference methods--makes it quite suitable for field application.","","","","USDOE, Washington, DC (United States)","","United States","1997-07-01T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: Geophysics; Journal Volume: 62; Journal Issue: 4; Other Information: PBD: Jul-Aug 1997","","Medium: X; Size: pp. 1047-1058","","","FG02-86ER13636","Journal ID: GPYSA7; ISSN 0016-8033; TRN: IM9744%%191","10.1190/1.1444206","","2009-12-16T00:00:00Z","533068","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/533068","","Geophysics","4","62"

From these soundings, a resistivity interpretation was produced using an inversion algorithm based on a structural parameterization. In the upper ten kilometers of the transect, the interpretation shows two segments of low resistivity lying beneath allochthonous rocks of the Late Mesozoic, Sevier thrust sheet. Subsequent industry drilling motivated in part by this surveying confirms the existence and position of the eastern subthrust conductor and, more spectacularly, identifies the presence of yet deeper, autochthonous Mesozoic rocks. A simple structural interpretation is offered where one underthrust segment of low-resistivity sediments was created originally, but this segment was broken later into two major ones during higher-angle Tertiary extension. For the middle and lower crust, the MT data imply a nearly 1-D resistivity structure of remarkable uniformity across the entire transect. Pre-existing structural fabrics have had no measurable influence on localizing regions of high temperature fluids and melting in the lower crust, at least averaged over the scale of tens of kilometers. Given its uniformity over a distance of 155 km or more, the depth to the regional deep conductor does not appear related to the distribution of high-temperature geothermal resources.","","","","National Science Foundation, Washington, DC (United States); USDOE, Washington, DC (United States)","","United States","1997-07-01T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: Geophysics; Journal Volume: 62; Journal Issue: 4; Other Information: PBD: Jul-Aug 1997","","Medium: X; Size: pp. 1069-1086","","","AC07-90ID12929; AC07-95ID13274","Journal ID: GPYSA7; ISSN 0016-8033; TRN: IM9744%%192","10.1190/1.1444208","","2009-12-16T00:00:00Z","533069","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/533069","","Geophysics","4","62"

Water movement in geothermal reservoirs, underground spreading of chemical wastes and other pollutants, thermal insulation, and solidification are just a few examples where the thermal natural convection or the combined thermosolutal natural convection in porous media are observed. This work describes a numerical study of double-diffusive natural convection in a square cavity filled with a porous medium. The flow is driven by a combined buoyancy effect due to both temperature and concentration variations. Several different flow models for porous media, such as Darcy flow, Forchheimer`s extension, Brinkman`s extension, and the generalized flow are considered. The coupled equations are solved using a finite volume approach with a projection algorithm for the momentum equation. Non-Darcian effects are analyzed through investigating the average heat and mass transfer rates. This study consists of a global analysis of each model and the comparison between them when the Darcy number varies. This work also focuses on the influence of the Lewis number on the inertial and boundary effects. It is shown that the inertial and boundary effects have a profound effect on the double-diffusive convection.","","","","USDOE","","United States","1997-06-01T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: Numerical Heat Transfer.

"Well pumping issues in commercial groundwater after heat pump systems","Rafferty, K","15 GEOTHERMAL ENERGY; 29 ENERGY PLANNING AND POLICY; HEAT PUMPS; ENERGY EFFICIENCY; GROUND WATER; PUMPING; GEOTHERMAL SPACE HEATING; TECHNOLOGY ASSESSMENT","Groundwater heat pump (GWHP) systems have historically been considered by many to be characterized by excessive pumping energy. When poorly designed or controlled, this can be true; however, much of the perception is a carryover from experiences in residential systems. In large commercial GWHP systems, overall pump efficiency is much higher, flow requirements (per ton) are generally lower and in many applications, pump head is reduced relative to residential systems. These factors combine to result in much lower unit pumping energy requirements than is commonly believed. In fact, under some conditions, groundwater systems can offer system performance superior to ground-coupled systems. Key to efficient well pumping design is the consideration of the three major power consuming components of the system: well pump, heat pumps and building loop pump. Careful consideration of the interaction between these components and their impact upon system performance is necessary in order to minimize operating costs for the building owner. The strategies discussed in this article are intended to address large (>50 tons) commercial GWHP systems. The basic system configuration is illustrated. The heat exchanger, separating the building loop from the groundwater distinguishes large systems from smaller installations in which the groundwater is commonly supplied directly to the heat pumps. Discussion of system performance focuses on the cooling mode since this is usually the dominant load in large buildings regardless of the climate.","","","","","","United States","1997-04-01T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: Geo-Heat Center Quarterly Bulletin; Journal Volume: 18; Journal Issue: 2; Other Information: PBD: Apr 1997","","Medium: X; Size: pp. 12-16","","","","Journal ID: GCQBDW; ISSN 0276-1084; TRN: 97:004161-0002","","","2009-12-16T00:00:00Z","543111","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/543111","","Geo-Heat Center Quarterly Bulletin","2","18"
"Reno Industrial Park geothermal district heating system","Lienau, P J","15 GEOTHERMAL ENERGY; NEVADA; GEOTHERMAL DISTRICT HEATING; GEOTHERMAL RESOURCES; STEAMBOAT SPRINGS; RESOURCE POTENTIAL; GEOTHERMAL POWER PLANTS","Ten miles south of Reno, on U.S. 395 near the junction of the road to historic Virginia City, is Steamboat Hot Springs, a popular stop for travelers since the mid-1800s. Legend has it that Mark Twain named the geothermal area because it looked and sounded like a chugging Mississippi River paddle-wheeler. It is said when he first saw the steam rising from the ground he exclaimed, {open_quotes}Behold! A Steamboat in the desert.{close_quotes} Over the years, the area has been used for its relaxing and curative qualities by Indians, settlers, and geothermal experts. Since the mid-1980s five geothermal power plants have been built at Steamboat Springs and in December 1996 it was announced that the proposed largest geothermal district heating system in the U.S. would supply an industrial park in the area. The active geothermal area is located within the north-south trending graben like trough between the Carson and Virginia Ranges at the southern end of Truckee Meadows. Hot springs and other geothermal features occur over an area of about one square mile. The mid-basin location is controlled by faulting more or less parallel to the major mountain-front faults. It is believed that the heat source for the system is a cooling magmatic body at depth. The Steamboat geothermal area consists of a deep, high-temperature (215{degrees}C to 240{degrees} C) geothermal system, a shallower, moderate-temperature (160{degrees}C to 18{degrees} C) system, and a number of shallow low-temperature (30{degrees}C to 80{degrees}C) subsystems. The higher temperature systems are used for electric-power generation. It is proposed that the exit fluids from the electric power plants be used for the geothermal district heating system.","","","","","","United States","1997-04-01T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: Geo-Heat Center Quarterly Bulletin; Journal Volume: 18; Journal Issue: 2; Other Information: PBD: Apr 1997","","Medium: X; Size: pp. 17-19","","","","Journal ID: GCQBDW; ISSN 0276-1084; TRN: 97:004161-0003","","","2009-12-16T00:00:00Z","543112","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/543112","","Geo-Heat Center Quarterly Bulletin","2","18"

The unsteady Navier-Stokes equations with the Brinkman-Forchheimer-extended Darcy model in the porous region are solved by using finite volume techniques. Changes in convective heat transfer and in effective axial heat conduction due to pulsation are investigated over broad ranges of the relevant parameters, i.e., the thickness of the porous layer and the frequency and amplitude of pulsation. The results obtained indicate that the effective axial thermal conductivity is substantially increased by pulsation, and this augmentation is more pronounced by partial fillings of porous material. This issue is of relevance to a host of thermal engineering applications, e.g., in geothermal reservoirs and Stirling engines.","","","","USDOE","","United States","1997-04-01T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: Numerical Heat Transfer.

Part 1: Implications for structure of the western caldera","Wannamaker, P E","15 GEOTHERMAL ENERGY; THERMAL SPRINGS; MAGNETOTELLURIC SURVEYS; NEW MEXICO; GEOMORPHOLOGY; CALDERAS; GEOLOGIC STRUCTURES; GEOLOGIC FAULTS","An extensive tensor controlled-source audiomagnetotelluric (CSAMT) survey has been carried out over the Sulphur Springs geothermal area, Valles Caldera, New Mexico. Forty-five sites were acquired using two crossed transmitter bipoles placed approximately 13 km south of the center of the survey. The soundings in the Sulphur Springs area were arranged in four profiles to cross major structural features. CSAMT and magnetotelluric (MT) data taken outside Valles Caldera were constrained by drill logs and imply resistive Bandelier Tuff, underlain by conductive Paleozoic sediments, and further underlain by resistive, primarily Precambrian crystalline rocks. Model cross-sections within the caldera were derived using 2-D parameterized inversion constrained by drilling, with layered-earth inversion for starting models. Southeast of the Sulphur Creek fault, the upper 200 m of the section are of relatively low resistivity and correspond to unconsolidated land-slide and debris flows. The Bandelier Tuff below exhibits higher but variable resistivities because of alteration controlled by local faulting. Beneath the Bandelier Tuff, the Paleozoic sedimentary layer is only moderately less resistive than it is outside the caldera, with the lowest values occurring northwest of Sulphur Creek. Its low resistivity per se does not necessarily represent a hydrothermal aquifer. The Sulphur Creek fault appears to be a locus of substantial change in structural relief; upthrow of stratigraphy and basement to its west appears to be about 400--500 m. A major normal fault down to the southeast is located under the topographic expression of Freelove Canyon, which is up to 1 km farther southeast than suggested by previous geologic sections. High resistivities possibly corresponding to a vapor zone in the upper 500 m near VC-2B and VC-2A are not consistent with the CSAMT data.","","","","USDOE, Washington, DC (United States)","","United States","1997-03-01T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: Geophysics; Journal Volume: 62; Journal Issue: 2; Other Information: PBD: Mar-Apr 1997","","Medium: X; Size: pp. 451-465","","","FG02-89ER14083; AC07-90ID12929","Journal ID: GPYSA7; ISSN 0016-8033; TRN: IM9726%%213","10.1190/1.1444156","","2009-12-16T00:00:00Z","483820","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/483820","","Geophysics","2","62"

Part 2: Implications for CSAMT methodology","Wannamaker, P E","15 GEOTHERMAL ENERGY; THERMAL SPRINGS; MAGNETOTELLURIC SURVEYS; NEW MEXICO; PERFORMANCE; CALDERAS; MATHEMATICAL MODELS; GEOLOGIC STRUCTURES","The resistivity model for the Sulphur Springs area in the companion paper (Part 1) plus the availability of overlapping controlled-source audiomagnetotelluric (CSAMT) and magnetotelluric (MT) data has allowed study of far-field to near-field transitions, source field geometries over the survey area, and scalar-tensor impedance discrepancies. The regional setting of conductive Paleozoic sediments over resistive basement seriously reduced depth of exploration within the plane-wave regime to about 1/20th of the transmitter-receiver separation, rather than the traditional 1/3rds to 1/5th based on half-space models. As frequency falls to where skin depth in the sedimentary layer exceeds its thickness, transmitter electromagnetic (EM) fields enter the resistive basement and may diffuse to the receiver with relatively little attenuation, promoting near-field behavior. Comparisons are made of observed electric (E) and magnetic (H) fields inside and outside the caldera with EM fields computed from layered resistivity models derived from local 1-D inversion of the {rho}{sub a} and {phi}, and from simple 3-D models. First, the comparisons indicate that small-scale structure near the transmitter does not lead to overprint effects in the impedance data at the receiver but, instead, acts as an equivalent far-field source. Second, at both high and low frequencies, the observed E and H fields can depart substantially from those predicted by local layered models. In fact, an effective regional layering appears to control the magnetic field amplitudes and the far- to near-field transition in this survey area. The observed electric fields, on the other hand, are controlled by all scales of geology.","","","","USDOE, Washington, DC (United States)","","United States","1997-03-01T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: Geophysics; Journal Volume: 62; Journal Issue: 2; Other Information: PBD: Mar-Apr 1997","","Medium: X; Size: pp. 466-476","","","FG02-89ER14083; AC07-90ID12929","Journal ID: GPYSA7; ISSN 0016-8033; TRN: IM9726%%214","10.1190/1.1444157","","2009-12-16T00:00:00Z","483821","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/483821","","Geophysics","2","62"

Veins are present throughout the drilled granite, and there are flows of warm water localized in fractures within the granite. Detailed mineralogical study of core material from the research drillhole EPSI has been carried out in order to assess the alteration history of the Soultz granite, part of the crystalline basement of the Rhine Graben. The results of the study have been used, in conjunction with analyses of present-day fluids from deep drilling in the Rhine Graben reported in the literature, to model thermodynamically the alteration process, and in particular to evaluate if it is likely to be continuing today. Reaction-path calculations show that if deep basinal brines, such as are known from sediments of the central Rhine Graben, react with Hercynian granite, they will form different alteration assemblages depending on both the path that the fluid follows (e.g., descending through sediments or through granite) and the extent of preexisting alteration of the granite. The calculations suggest that fluid now sampled from granite in EPS-1 achieved its peak temperature, c. 200{degrees}C while within Permo-Triassic sandstone. The modeling also indicates that present-day fluids from the Rhine Graben system are capable of producing the vein quartz and possibly also the baryte veins, seen in the EPSI core. Much of the alteration present in the granite in the vicinity of veins and fractures may have been produced by a flow regime similar to that prevailing today. 48 refs., 15 figs., 4 tabs.","","","","","","United States","1997-02-01T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: Geochimica et Cosmochimica Acta; Journal Volume: 61; Journal Issue: 3; Other Information: PBD: Feb 1997","","Medium: X; Size: pp. 515-531","","","","Journal ID: GCACAK; ISSN 0016-7037; CNN: Project JOU-CRT93-0318; TRN: 98:000522-0001","10.1016/S0016-7037(96)00358-4","","2009-12-16T00:00:00Z","569854","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/569854","","Geochimica et Cosmochimica Acta","3","61"

REE concentrations in the volcanic rocks range from 222 to 347 ppm: their chondrite-normalised REE patterns are typical of upper continental crust, with LREE > HREE and negative Eu anomalies. Total REE concentrations in the fluids range from 3 to 1133 nmol kg{sup -1} ({ge}162 ppm), and {Sigma}REE concentrations in sinter are {ge}181 ppm. REE abundances and patterns in drill core material from YNP indicate some REE mobility. Relative to the host rocks the REE patterns of the fluids are variably depleted in HREEs and LREEs, and usually have a pronounced positive Eu anomaly. This decoupling of Eu from the REE suite suggests that (1) Eu has been preferentially removed either from the host rock glass or from the host rock minerals, or (2) the waters are from a high temperature or reducing environment where Eu{sup 2+} is more soluble than the trivalent REEs. Since the latter is inconsistent with production of acid-sulphate springs in a low temperature, oxidising near-surface environment, we suggest that the positive Eu anomalies in the fluids result from preferential dissolution of a Eu-rich phase in the host rock. Spatial and temporal variations in major element chemistry and pH of the springs sampled from Norris Geyser Basin and Crater Hills accompany variations in REE concentrations and patterns of individual geothermal springs. These are possibly related to changes in subsurface plumbing, which results in variations in mixing and dilution of the geothermal fluids and may have lead to changes in the extent and nature of REE complexing. 37 refs., 7 figs., 4 tabs.","","","","","","United States","1997-02-01T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: Geochimica et Cosmochimica Acta; Journal Volume: 61; Journal Issue: 4; Other Information: PBD: Feb 1997","","Medium: X; Size: pp. 695-706","","","","Journal ID: GCACAK; ISSN 0016-7037; TRN: 98:000354-0001","10.1016/S0016-7037(96)00384-5","","2009-12-16T00:00:00Z","567947","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/567947","","Geochimica et Cosmochimica Acta","4","61"

Because of its importance in oceanography, thermohaline convection in viscous liquids has received more attention than thermohaline convection in porous media. The fingered and layered convection patterns observed in viscous liquid thermohaline convection have been hypothesized to occur also in porous media. However, the extension of convective dynamics from viscous liquid systems to porous media systems is complicated by the presence of the solid matrix in porous media. The solid grains cause thermal retardation, hydrodynamic dispersion, and permeability effects. We present simulations of thermohaline convection in model systems based on the Salton Sea Geothermal System, California, that serve to point out the general dynamics of porous media thermohaline convection in the diffusive regime, and the effects of porosity and permeability, in particular. We use the TOUGH2 simulator with residual formulation and fully coupled solution technique for solving the strongly coupled equations governing thermohaline convection in porous media. We incorporate a model for brine density that takes into account the effects of NaCl and CaCl2. Simulations show that in forced convection, the increased pore velocity and thermal retardation in low-porosity regions enhances brine transport relative to heat transport. In thermohaline convection, the heat and brine transport are strongly coupled and enhanced transport of brine over heat cannot occur because buoyancy caused by heat and brine together drive the flow. Random permeability heterogeneity has a limited effect if the scale of flow is much larger than the scale of permeability heterogeneity. For the system studied here, layered thermohaline convection persists for more than one million years for a variety of initial conditions. Our simulations suggest that layered thermohaline convection is possible in hypersaline geothermal systems provided the vertical permeability is smaller than the horizontal permeability, as is likely in sedimentary basins such as the Salton Trough. Layered thermohaline convection can explain many of the observations made at the Salton Sea Geothermal System over the years.","","","Lawrence Berkeley National Lab.

The siliceous sinter that precipitated around their vents has the characteristics of geyserite, a dense laminated deposit of presumed abiogenic origin, that was precipitated from waters too hot (>73C) to support microbes other than thermophilic bacteria. Petrographic and SEM examinations of the sinters show that they incorporate columnar stromatolites and silicified, laminated stromatolitic mats that contain well-preserved filamentous microbes. At both localities the microbes lack evidence of desiccation or shrinkage, which implies that they were silicified rapidly at or shortly after their death. Although boiling and very hot (>90 C) waters were discharged, temperatures at many sites surrounding the vents remained sufficiently low and moist to support a microbial community that included thermophilic bacteria and cyanobacteria. In these cooler niches, the microbes and their biofilms served as highly favorable templates for the nucleation and growth of amorphous silica, and collectively provided a microbial framework for the laminated accretionary sinter. Some columnar, spicular, and stratiform geyserites are probably not abiotic precipitates, but are true silica stromatolites.","","","","Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of Canada, Ottawa, ON (Canada)","","United States","1997-01-01T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: Journal of Sedimentary Research, Section A: Sedimentary Petrology and Processes; Journal Volume: 67; Journal Issue: 1; Other Information: PBD: Jan 1997","","Medium: X; Size: pp. 88-104","","","","Journal ID: JSRAEA; ISSN 1073-130X; TRN: IM9715%%215","","","2009-12-16T00:00:00Z","452183","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/452183","","Journal of Sedimentary Research, Section A: Sedimentary Petrology and Processes","1","67"

The measuring system was installed as a permanent sensor in the annulus between casing and tubings. The injection/extraction regime was monitored by repeating the measurements every few weeks. Short-term variations of the temperature during injection and extraction were studied by recording the temperature profile every 1 min over a time period of several hours. Testing shows that the fiber optic temperature sensing technique opens new possibilities for measuring the actual temperature along the entire length of a borehole as well as for monitoring short-term and long-term temperature variations.","","","","USDOE","","United States","1997-01-01T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: Energy Sources; Journal Volume: 19; Journal Issue: 1; Conference: World geothermal congress: worldwide utilization of geothermal energy, Florence (Italy), 18-31 May 1995; Other Information: PBD: Jan 1997","","Medium: X; Size: pp. 55-62","","CONF-950514-","","Journal ID: EGYSAO; ISSN 0090-8312; TRN: IM9717%%263","10.1080/00908319708908832","","2016-05-10T00:00:00Z","458477","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/458477","","Energy Sources","1","19"

In virtually all operating systems, the geothermal fluid is used in a hot water heating system to meet 100% of both the peak and annual heating requirements of the structure. This strategy is a result of the relatively low costs associated with the development of most US geothermal direct-use resources and past tax credit programs which penalized systems using any conventional fuel sources. Increasingly, greenhouse operations will encounter limitations in available geothermal resource flow due either to production or disposal considerations. As a result, it will be necessary to operate additions at reduced water temperatures reflective of the effluent from the existing operations. Water temperature has a strong influence on heating system design. Greenhouse operators tend to have unequivocal preferences regarding heating system equipment. Many growers, particularly cut flower and bedding plant operators, prefer the {open_quotes}bare tube{close_quotes} type heating system. This system places small diameter plastic tubes under the benches or adjacent to the plants. Hot water is circulated through the tubes providing heat to the plants and the air in the greenhouse. Advantages include the ability to provide the heat directly to the plants, low cost, simple installation and the lack of a requirement for fans to circulate air. The major disadvantage of the system is poor performance at low (<140{degrees}F) water temperatures, particularly in cold climates. Under these conditions, the quantity of tubing required to meet the peak heating load is substantial. In fact, under some conditions, it is simply impractical to install sufficient tubing in the greenhouse to meet the peak heating load.","","","","","","United States","1997-01-01T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: Geo-Heat Center Quarterly Bulletin; Journal Volume: 18; Journal Issue: 1; Other Information: PBD: Jan 1997","","Medium: X; Size: pp. 1-4","","","","Journal ID: GCQBDW; ISSN 0276-1084; TRN: 97:002455-0001","","","2009-12-16T00:00:00Z","543082","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/543082","","Geo-Heat Center Quarterly Bulletin","1","18"

Using geothermal energy is both an economical and efficient way to heat greenhouses. Greenhouse heating systems can be designed to utilize low-temperature (>50{degrees}C or 122{degrees}F) resources, which makes the greenhouse an attractive application. These resources are widespread throughout the western states providing a significant potential for expansion of the geothermal greenhouse industry. This article summarizes the development of geothermal heated greenhouses, which mainly began about the mid-1970`s. Based on a survey (Lienau, 1988) conducted in 1988 and updated in 1997, there are 37 operators of commercial greenhouses.

A set of 480 high-quality microearthquakes distributed evenly throughout the field and with a minimum of 10 P-wave arrivals was selected for the study. They constructed spectral ratios by dividing each spectrum with a reference spectrum from each observing station. The reference spectrum was derived from the average spectrum of all events that were recorded at that station to correct for the strong site dependence of the observed spectra. They then estimated the differential attenuation operator from the slopes of the spectral ratios. The velocity models and the raypaths for all events are known from a previous velocity inversion study. The inversion for the differential attenuation structure was carried out using a modified progressive inversion method. The observed Q structure correlates well with mapped geologic units. High Q and lower velocities correlate with Franciscan melange, while lower attenuation and higher velocities correspond to metagraywacke units. High P-wave Q also underlies the southern region between 2 and 3 km depth where low V{sub p}/V{sub s} values suggest undersaturation of the reservoir rocks. Most of the steam entries also occur within this region and probably delineate the steam reservoir. These anomalies may be explained by high rock temperatures and the presence of steam and other gases.","","","","","","United States","1997-01-01T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: Geophysics; Journal Volume: 62; Journal Issue: 1; Other Information: PBD: Jan-Feb 1997","","Medium: X; Size: pp. 149-167","","","AC03-76SF00098","Journal ID: GPYSA7; ISSN 0016-8033; TRN: 97:006666","10.1190/1.1444114","","2009-12-16T00:00:00Z","452197","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/452197","","Geophysics","1","62"
"Resistivity During Boiling in the SB-15-D Core from the Geysers Geothermal Field: The Effects of Capillarity","Roberts, J; Duba, A; Bonner, B; Kasameyer, P","15 GEOTHERMAL ENERGY; BOILING; BOREHOLES; DISTRIBUTION; ELECTRIC CONDUCTIVITY; GEOTHERMAL FIELDS; MONITORING; PORE PRESSURE; WATER; Geothermal Legacy","In a laboratory study of cores from borehole SB-15-D in The Geysers geothermal area, we measured the electrical resistivity of metashale with and without pore-pressure control, with confining pressures up to 100 bars and temperatures between 20 and 150 C, to determine how the pore-size distribution and capillarity affected boiling. We observed a gradual increase in resistivity when the downstream pore pressure or confining pressure decreased below the phase boundary of free water. For the conditions of this experiment, boiling, as indicated by an increase in resistivity, is initiated at pore pressures of approximately 0.5 to 1 bar (0.05 to 0.1 MPa) below the free-water boiling curve, and it continues to increase gradually as pressure is lowered to atmospheric. A simple model of the effects of capillarity suggests that at 145 C, less than 15% of the pore water can boil in these rocks. If subsequent experiments bear out these preliminary observations, then boiling within a geothermal reservoir is controlled not just by pressure and temperature but also by pore-size distribution. Thus, it may be possible to determine reservoir characteristics by monitoring changes in electrical resistivity as reservoir conditions change.","","","Lawrence Livermore National Lab.

"The chemical and isotopic composition of fumarolic gases and spring discharges from Galeras Volcano, Colombia.","Fischer, T P; Sturchio, N C; Stix, J; Arehart, G B; Counce, D; Williams, S N; Arizona State Univ.; Univ. de Montreal; LANL,","15 GEOTHERMAL ENERGY; ACID CARBONATES; ACID SULFATES; COLOMBIA; GASES; GROUND WATER; HYDROTHERMAL SYSTEMS; MAGMATIC WATER; THERMAL SPRINGS; VOLCANOES; FUMAROLES","Galeras fumarole discharges have been collected since its reactivation, in 1988, through December 1995. The gases are dominated by H{sub 2}O, CO{sub 2}, S (as SO{sub 2} and H{sub 2}S) and HCl. The relative proportions of these gases classify them as 'magmatic'. Thermodynamic equilibrium temperatures of the gases range from 260 to &gt; 600 C. The relative abundance of inert gases, N{sub 2}, Ar and He, can be used as 'tracers' to identify the source of the fumarole discharges. At Galeras the majority of the samples have a composition characteristic of gases originating from arc-related magmas, with relatively high N{sub 2} contents and minor He and Ar. During 1993, the year of frequent eruptions, the gas composition changed to basaltic or 'mantle-derived' gases, with significantly higher He contents. This is interpreted to be the result of injection of volatiles from a basaltic magma body at depth prior to and during the increased eruptive activity of 1993. The {delta}{sup 13}C values for CO{sub 2} in fumarole discharges are typical of andesitic volcanoes and may indicate addition of MORB-derived CO{sub 2}. The {delta}{sup 15}N values for N2 may indicate significant contribution of N{sub 2} from marine sediments and only minor contribution of MORB-derived N{sub 2}. The {delta} D and {delta}{sup 18}O values of the discharging steam lie on a mixing trend between the isotopic composition of 'arc-related' magmatic water and {sup 18}O-shifted meteoric water. The most magmatic discharges have {delta} D values of -30 to -35{per_thousand}; while the most meteoric discharges have values of -70 to -75{per_thousand}, similar to Galeras thermal spring waters. Galeras thermal water discharges consist of acid sulfate and bicarbonate waters. S/Cl ratios in the acid sulfate waters are similar to fumarole ratios, suggesting direct absorption of magmatic gases into shallow ground waters. This is supported by the essentially meteoric {delta}D and {delta}{sup 18}O values of the discharges and by elevated {sup 3}He/{sup 4}He ratios of thermal spring waters. The absorption of acid S- and Cl-rich gases yield acid waters which are capable of dissolving rocks. The thermal waters, however, are far from equilibrium with Galeras lavas and pyroclastic rocks, providing evidence of the immaturity of the Galeras hydrothermal system. The SO{sub 4} and Cl content, as well as the O and H isotopic composition of Galeras thermal springs vary with the activity of the volcano. The 7-year sampling program at Galeras revealed intriguing results concerning the activity of Galeras, its magmatic-hydrothermal system and the origin of the volatiles. Despite decreasing outlet temperatures since 1992, deep temperatures remain high, implying continued unrest in the Galeras magmatic system.","","","Argonne National Lab.

"Group additivity equations of state for calculating the standard molal thermodynamic properties of aqueous organic species at elevated temperatures and pressures","Amend, J P; Helgeson, H C","15 GEOTHERMAL ENERGY; 54 ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCES; 40 CHEMISTRY; THERMODYNAMIC PROPERTIES; ORGANIC COMPOUNDS; HYDROCARBONS; GEOCHEMISTRY; HYDROTHERMAL SYSTEMS","Group additivity equations of state for aqueous organic molecules have been generated by combining the revised Helgeson-Kirkham-Howers (HKF) equations of state with experimental values of the standard molal properties of aqueous alkanes, alkanols, alkylbenzenes, carboxylic acids, amides, and amines. Equations of state parameters for the groups represented by -CH{sub 2}-, -CH{sub 3}, -CHCH{sub 3}, -C{sub 6}H{sub 5}, -CH{sub 2}OH, -COOH, -CONH{sub 2}, and -CH{sub 2}NH{sub 2} were determined by regression of the experimental data. This procedure permits calculation of the standard molal thermodynamic properties of these groups at elevated temperatures and pressures. Although curves representing the apparent standard molal Gibbs free energies ({Delta}G{degrees}) and enthalpies ({Delta}H{degrees}) of formation, and the standard molal entropies (S{degrees}) of the groups as a function of temperature and pressure are respectively similar for each of them, the temperature dependence of the standard molal heat capacities (C{degrees}{sub P}) and volumes (V{degrees}) of a number of the groups are quite different from one another. For example, the standard molal heat capacities of the hydrocarbon groups minimize with increasing temperature, but those of -CH{sub 2}OH and -CH{sub 2}NH{sub 2} maximize. Computed values of {Delta}G{degrees}, {Delta}H{degrees}, S{degrees}, C{degrees}{sub P}, V{degrees}, and the equations of state parameters for the various groups were used together with group additivity relations to generate corresponding values of these properties for aqueous n-alkanes, 2-methylalkanes, n-alkylbenzenes, n-alkanols, n-carboxylic acids, n-amides, and n-amines at temperatures {le} 250{degrees}C and pressures {le} 1 kbar. 159 refs., 25 figs., 20 tabs.","","","","","","United States","1997-01-01T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: Geochimica et Cosmochimica Acta; Journal Volume: 61; Journal Issue: 1; Other Information: PBD: Jan 1997","","Medium: X; Size: pp. 11-46","","","FG03-85ER13419","Journal ID: GCACAK; ISSN 0016-7037; CNN: Grant EAR-8606052;Grant EAR-9117393; TRN: 98:000349-0002","10.1016/S0016-7037(96)00306-7","","2009-12-16T00:00:00Z","569878","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/569878","","Geochimica et Cosmochimica Acta","1","61"
"Geothermal carbon dioxide for use in greenhouses","Dunstall, M G; Graeber, G","15 GEOTHERMAL ENERGY; GREENHOUSES; HEATING SYSTEMS; CARBON DIOXIDE; PLANTS; GROWTH; STIMULATION; GEOTHERMAL FLUIDS; A CODES","Geothermal fluids often contain carbon dioxide, which is a very effective growth stimulant for plants in greenhouses. Studies have shown that as CO{sub 2} concentration is increased from a normal level of 300 ppm (mmol/kmol) to levels of approximately 1000 ppm crop yields may increase by up to 15% (Ullmann`s Encyclopedia of Industrial Chemistry, 1989). It is suggested that geothermal greenhouse heating offers a further opportunity for utilization of the carbon dioxide present in the fluid. The main difficulty is that plants react adversely to hydrogen sulphide which is invariably mixed, at some concentration, with the CO{sub 2} from geothermal fluids. Even very low H{sub 2}S concentrations of 0.03 mg/kg can have negative effects on the growth of plants (National Research Council, 1979). Therefore, an appropriate purification process for the CO{sub 2} must be used to avoid elevated H{sub 2}S levels in the greenhouses. The use of adsorption and absorption processes is proposed. Two purification processes have been modelled using the ASOEN PLUS software package, using the Geothermal Greenhouses Ltd. Operation Kawerau New Zealand and an example. A greenhouse area of 8,000 m{sup 2}, which would create a demand for approximately 20 kg CO{sub 2} per hour, was chosen based on a proposed expansion at Kawerau. The Kawerau operation currently takes geothermal steam (and gas) from a high temperature 2-phase well to heat an area of 1650 m{sup 2}. Bottled carbon dioxide is utilized at a rate of about 50 kg per day, to provide CO{sub 2} levels of 800 mg/kg when the greenhouse is closed and 300 to 350 mg/kg whilst venting. In England and the Netherlands, CO{sub 2} levels of 1000 mg/kg are often used (Ullmann`s Encyclopedia of Industrial Chemistry, 1989) and similar concentrations are desired at Kawerau, but current costs of 0.60 NZ$/kg for bottled CO{sub 2} are too high (Foster, 1995).","","","","","","United States","1997-01-01T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: Geo-Heat Center Quarterly Bulletin; Journal Volume: 18; Journal Issue: 1; Other Information: PBD: Jan 1997","","Medium: X; Size: pp. 8-13","","","","Journal ID: GCQBDW; ISSN 0276-1084; TRN: 97:002455-0003","","","2009-12-16T00:00:00Z","543084","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/543084","","Geo-Heat Center Quarterly Bulletin","1","18"

This concentrated demand for energy can be satisfied, in the case of geothermal, by siting facilities near wells even though they are located far from urban areas and industrial concentrations. The reasons for this high energy requirement are in the nature of the greenhouse construction itself: (1) Greenhouses are typically constructed of light materials that have very poor insulating qualities, and (2) The {open_quotes}internal{close_quotes} climate of the greenhouse are usually significantly different than the external one, especially during the colder seasons.","","","","","","United States","1997-01-01T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: Geo-Heat Center Quarterly Bulletin; Journal Volume: 18; Journal Issue: 1; Other Information: PBD: Jan 1997","","Medium: X; Size: pp. 14-20","","","","Journal ID: GCQBDW; ISSN 0276-1084; TRN: 97:002455-0004","","","2009-12-16T00:00:00Z","543085","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/543085","","Geo-Heat Center Quarterly Bulletin","1","18"

The process itself depends on a number of flexible parameters, allowing this technology to be tailored to specific needs of different geothermal producing regimes, such as those found in the Salton Sea and the Geysers area of California. Thus geothermal residual sludges and brines can be processed to remove only a few metals, such as arsenic and mercury, or many metals, ranging from valuable metals such as chromium, gold, and silver to radionuclides, such as radium. In some cases, combined metal removal and metal recovery processes may be cost efficient and therefore advantageous. The emerging biotechnology for the treatment of geothermal energy production wastes is versatile and offers a number of application options, which are discussed in the paper.","","","","USDOE, Washington, DC (United States)","","United States","1997-01-01T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: Energy Sources; Journal Volume: 19; Journal Issue: 1; Conference: World geothermal congress: worldwide utilization of geothermal energy, Florence (Italy), 18-31 May 1995; Other Information: PBD: Jan 1997","","Medium: X; Size: pp. 9-17","","CONF-950514-","","Journal ID: EGYSAO; ISSN 0090-8312; TRN: IM9717%%259","10.1080/00908319708908828","","2016-04-27T00:00:00Z","458473","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/458473","","Energy Sources","1","19"

As a major constitutive mineral in natural geologic systems, quartz was selected for study. Dissolution experiments were carried out in a continuous-flow, titanium autoclave reactor system at 100--200 C in various chemical environments. Acidification to pH 1.1 using nitric acid showed very little effect on the quartz dissolution rate. The effect of hydroxide ion concentration and ionic strength were evaluated in NaOH, NaOH/NaCl and NaOH/Na{sub 2}SO{sub 4} solutions. The fractional-order dependency of the quartz dissolution rate on hydroxide ion and sodium ion (or ionic strength) concentration was determined in NaOH/NaCl solutions. The results that extend the available range of kinetic data for quartz generally agree with previous work. The observed fractional-order kinetics were qualitatively described using classical adsorption isotherms. No significant variation in the apparent reaction order of the hydroxide ion with increasing temperature could be determined due to the scatter in the data. Quartz dissolution rates were slower by about 40% in NaOH/Na{sub 2}SO{sub 4} solutions than in NaOH/NaCl solutions at sodium concentrations higher than 0.01 molal. The apparent activation energy from 100 to 200 C in NaOH/NaCl solutions up to 0.01 molal hydroxide ion and 0.1 molal sodium ion was estimated to be 72 ({+-}6) kJ/mol.","","","","","","United States","1996-12-01T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: AIChE Journal; Journal Volume: 42; Journal Issue: 12; Other Information: PBD: Dec 1996","","Medium: X; Size: pp. 3442-3455","","","","Journal ID: AICEAC; ISSN 0001-1541; TRN: 97:002105","10.1002/aic.690421214","","2009-12-16T00:00:00Z","419885","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/419885","","AIChE Journal","12","42"

Numerous subaerial and subaqueous spring deposits are known from the geological record as a result of the occurrence of economic mineral deposits in many of them. Some are reported to contain fossils, but very few have been studied by paleobiologists; they represent an untapped source of paleobiological information on the history of hydrothermal ecosystems. Such systems are of special interest, given the molecular biological evidence that thermophilic bacteria lie near the root of the tree of extant life. The Drummond Basin sinters are very closely comparable with modern examples in Yellowstone National Park and elsewhere. Thirteen microfacies are recognisable in the field, ranging from high temperature apparently abiotic geyserite through various forms of stromatolitic sinter probably of cyanobacterial origin to ambient temperature marsh deposits. Microfossils in the stromatolites are interpreted as cyanobacterial sheaths. Herbaceous lycopsids occur in the lower temperature deposits. 56 refs., 23 figs., 1 tab.","","","","USDOE","","United States","1996-12-01T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: Palaios; Journal Volume: 11; Journal Issue: 6; Other Information: PBD: Dec 1996","","Medium: X; Size: pp. 497-518","","","","Journal ID: PALAEM; ISSN 0883-1351; TRN: 97:001051-0001","10.2307/3515187","","2016-05-10T00:00:00Z","525880","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/525880","","Palaios","6","11"
"Lichens as bioindicators of geothermal air pollution in central Italy","Loppi, S","15 GEOTHERMAL ENERGY; 54 ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCES; AIR POLLUTION; BIOLOGICAL INDICATORS; LICHENS; CHEMICAL COMPOSITION; GEOTHERMAL INDUSTRY; ITALY","The suitability of lichens as bioindicators of geothermal air pollution was evaluated in central Italy. Fifty-one sites were sampled in the Travale-Radicondoli geothermal field, an area of about 15 km{sup 2}. Lichens on 1-5 trees per station were sampled, using 30 x 50 cm grids on tree boles, where lichens were most dense. Index of Atmospheric Purity (IAP) was calculated as the sum of the frequencies of all lichen species present at the station. Using automatic mapping programs, the area was divided into four air quality zones and the lowest IAP values were found within about 500 m of geothermal power plants. No direct measurements of air pollution are available for the whole study area, however, other studies show that air pollution levels (mercury, boron) fall with distance from a geothermal source. Also no substrate parameter (height, circumference, bark pH, and buffer capacity of the trees) discriminates between IAP zones. This suggests that air pollution arising from geothermal emissions is responsible for the zonation shown, with values for species richness and IAP rising with distance from geothermal installations. It is concluded that lichens are reliable bioindicators of geothermal pollution. 64 refs., 1 fig., 3 tabs.","","","","USDOE","","United States","1996-11-01T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: Bryologist; Journal Volume: 99; Journal Issue: 1; Other Information: PBD: Spr 1996","","Medium: X; Size: pp. 41-48","","","","Journal ID: BRYOAM; ISSN 0007-2745; TRN: 96:004423-0001","10.2307/3244436","","2016-05-27T00:00:00Z","381314","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/381314","","Bryologist","1","99"

It has been heated by geothermal energy since the end of the seventies. Prior to that, it was partly heated by electricity, but mainly with oil burners, located within individual buildings. During the period 1928-1970, several attempts were made to exploit known hot spring areas in the vicinity of Akureyri. These attempts failed. Following the jump in energy price during the oil crisis of 1973, considerable effort was put into further exploration. Based on resistivity soundings, the Laugaland field was selected for deep drilling. In 1975, this resulted in the discovery of a big feed zone, which initially yielded around 100 1/s of 90{degrees}C hot water by free flow. Two years later another big feed zone was located at the Ytri-Tjarnir geothermal field initially yielding 50 1/2 of 80{degrees}C water. Based on short-term pump tests, and simulations by the Theis model, it was estimated that these two fields together could yield 240 1/s with a water level drawdown to 190 m below the surface. This was expected to satisfy the energy need for space heating in Akureyri. In 1977, Hitaveita Akureyrar was, therefore, established. Construction of the district heating system was initiated in 1976 and most of the town had been connected in 1979.","","","","","","United States","1996-11-01T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: Geo-Heat Center Quarterly Bulletin; Journal Volume: 17; Journal Issue: 4; Other Information: PBD: Nov 1996","","Medium: X; Size: pp. 17-22","","","","Journal ID: GCQBDW; ISSN 0276-1084; TRN: 97:000815-0004","","","2009-12-16T00:00:00Z","508604","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/508604","","Geo-Heat Center Quarterly Bulletin","4","17"

About 85% of all houses are heated with geothermal energy; the rest are heated mainly by electricity. So far, geothermal resources have only, to a limited extent, been used for electric power generation, because of the availability of relatively cheap hydropower resources.

Experiments reacting rhyolite with 0.5 molal solutions of CO{sub 2} at 200{degrees} and 350{degrees}C were carried out to test the hypothesis of Fournier to explain the chemistry of these springs: that CO{sub 2} is relatively unreactive with volcanic rocks at temperatures >270{degrees}C. The experimental results strongly support this hypothesis. Extent of alteration is twenty-seven times greater at 200{degrees}C than at 350{degrees}C. The dominant process in the experiments appears to be the alteration of the albitic component of the rhyolite by dissolved CO{sub 2} to form a kaolinite-like alteration product plus quartz: 2NaAlSi{sub 3}O{sub 8} + 2CO{sub 2} + 3H{sub 2}O = 2Na{sup +} + 2HCO{sub 3}{sup -} + Al{sub 2}Si{sub 2}O{sub 5}(OH){sub 4} + 4SiO{sub 2}. CO{sub 2} reacts with water to form H{sub 2}CO{sub 3} which dissociates to H{sup +} and HCO{sub 3}{sup -}, more so at lower temperatures. Kinetic and thermodynamic considerations suggest that the reactivity of H{sub 2}CO{sub 3} with wallrocks is at its maximum between 150{degrees} and 200{degrees}C, consuming most of the H{sup +} and liberating equivalent amounts of cations and bicarbonate. Wallrocks in higher temperature reservoirs are relatively unreactive to dissolved CO{sub 2} which is eventually lost from the system by boiling. These observations also offer a possible explanation for the change in chemical sediments from chloride-dominated to bicarbonate-dominated salts found in the stratigraphic section at Searles Lake, California, the terminus of the Owens River which derives its dissolved load from hot springs of the Long Valley caldera. 21 refs., 5 figs., 2 tabs.","","","","","","United States","1996-10-01T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: Geochimica et Cosmochimica Acta; Journal Volume: 60; Journal Issue: 20; Other Information: PBD: Oct 1996","","Medium: X; Size: pp. 3859-3867","","","","Journal ID: GCACAK; ISSN 0016-7037; TRN: 98:000353-0004","10.1016/0016-7037(96)00208-6","","2009-12-16T00:00:00Z","577440","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/577440","","Geochimica et Cosmochimica Acta","20","60"

The Cole-Cole dispersion model is assumed to represent the frequency dependence of the impedivity complex function, defined as the inverse of Stoyer`s admittivity complex parameter. To simulate real geological situations, they consider three structural models, representing a sedimentary basin, a geothermal system and a magma chamber, assumed to be partially or totally dispersive. From a detailed study of the frequency and space behaviors of the magnetotelluric parameters, taking known non-dispersive results as reference, they outline the main peculiarities of the local distortion effects, caused by the presence of dispersion in the target media. Finally, they discuss the interpretive errors which can be made by neglecting the dispersion phenomena. The apparent dispersion function, which was defined in a previous paper to describe similar effects in the one-dimensional case, is again used as a reliable indicator of location, shape and spatial extent of the dispersive bodies. The general result of this study is a marked improvement in the resolution power of the magnetotelluric method.","","","","USDOE","","United States","1996-09-01T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: Geophysical Prospecting; Journal Volume: 44; Journal Issue: 5; Other Information: PBD: Sep 1996","","Medium: X; Size: pp. 789-818","","","","Journal ID: GPPRAR; ISSN 0016-8025; TRN: IM9646%%362","10.1111/j.1365-2478.1996.tb00174.x","","2016-04-15T00:00:00Z","390077","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/390077","","Geophysical Prospecting","5","44"

Immense amounts of thermal energy are generated and stored in the earth`s core, mantle, and crust. The heat is transferred from the interior towards the surface mostly by conduction, and this conductive heat flow makes temperatures rise with increasing depth in the crust on average 25-30{degrees}C/km. This is called the geothermal gradient. The recoverable thermal energy theoretically suitable for direct applications has been estimated at 2.9 {times} 10{sup 24} Joules, which is about 10,000 times the present annual world consumption of primary energy without regard to grade (Armstead, 1983). Most of the earth`s heat is, however, far too deeply buried to be tapped by man, even under the most optimistic assumptions of technological development. Geothermal energy has at present a considerable economic potential only in areas where thermal water or steam is concentrated at depths less than 3 km(1.9 mi) in restricted volumes analogous to oil in commercial oil reservoirs. The drilling technology is similar for geothermal fluid as for oil. But as the energy content of a barrel of oil is much greater than an equivalent amount of hot water, the economic requirements for permeability of the formations and the productivity of the geothermal wells are much higher than for oil wells. Geothermal production wells are commonly 2 km (1.2 mi) deep, but rarely much over 3 km (1.9 mi) at present.","","","","","","United States","1996-08-01T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: Geo-Heat Center Quarterly Bulletin; Journal Volume: 17; Journal Issue: 3; Other Information: PBD: Aug 1996","","Medium: X; Size: pp. 1-5","","","","Journal ID: GCQBDW; ISSN 0276-1084; TRN: 97:000139-0001","","","2009-12-16T00:00:00Z","508608","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/508608","","Geo-Heat Center Quarterly Bulletin","3","17"
"Klamath Falls geothermal district heating system evaluation","Brown, B","15 GEOTHERMAL ENERGY; 29 ENERGY PLANNING AND POLICY; KLAMATH FALLS; GEOTHERMAL RESOURCES; GEOTHERMAL DISTRICT HEATING; EVALUATION; PERFORMANCE; PUBLIC OPINION","The city of Klamath Falls, Oregon, is located near a geothermal resource that has provided heating for homes, businesses, schools, and institutions for many years. Almost 20 years ago, in 1977, Klamath Falls and Klamath County became interested in establishing a geothermal district heating system to extend the benefits of the geothermal resource to government buildings and businesses in downtown Klamath Falls. The district heating system was constructed in 1981 to initially serve 14 government buildings with planned expansion to serve additional building along the route. The expectation at the time was that the system would have a high initial load and rapid expansion to full capacity. When the system feasibility was studied, the cost of natural gas was increasing rapidly; that trend was expected to continue, making geothermal energy highly attractive by comparison (Lienau, et al., 1977). The promise of profitable operation has been elusive, even after fifteen years. More than once, financial and operational problems have resulted in serious consideration of shutting the system down. Challenges faced by the system have included: (1) initial opposition from other geothermal users to operating the system, resulting in a three year delay in system start-up to 1984, (2) failure of a portion of the distribution system piping after one season of operation, resulting in five years of downtime, reconstruction cost, and poor public perception of the system, (3) low-load factor, with the system operating at only about 15-20 percent of design capacity, and (4) low-natural gas cost, resulting in pressure to keep district heating energy costs low and leaving little incentive for new customers to connect. While the district heating system has had more than its share of problems, there has been a strong underlying support for geothermal energy and the will to work through the problems.","","","","","","United States","1996-08-01T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: Geo-Heat Center Quarterly Bulletin; Journal Volume: 17; Journal Issue: 3; Other Information: PBD: Aug 1996","","Medium: X; Size: pp. 16-23","","","","Journal ID: GCQBDW; ISSN 0276-1084; TRN: 97:000139-0004","","","2009-12-16T00:00:00Z","508611","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/508611","","Geo-Heat Center Quarterly Bulletin","3","17"

"Direct heat utilization of geothermal resources","Lund, J W","15 GEOTHERMAL ENERGY; GEOTHERMAL RESOURCES; RESOURCE POTENTIAL; GEOTHERMAL HEATING SYSTEMS; HISTORICAL ASPECTS; GEOTHERMAL ENERGY; USES; GEOTHERMAL SPACE HEATING","Direct or non-electric utilization of geothermal energy refers to the immediate use of the heat energy rather than to its conversion to some other form such as electrical energy. The primary forms of direct use include swimming, bathing and balneology (therapeutic use), space heating and cooling including district heating, agriculture (mainly greenhouse heating and some animal husbandry), aquaculture (mainly fish pond and raceway heating), industrial processes, and heat pumps (for both heating and cooling). In general, the geothermal fluid temperatures required for direct heat use are lower than those for economic electric power generation. Most direct use applications use geothermal fluids in the low-to-moderate temperature range between 50{degrees} and 150{degrees}C, and in general, the reservoir can be exploited by conventional water well drilling equipment. Low-temperature systems are also more widespread than high-temperature systems (above 150{degrees}C), so they are more likely to be located near potential users. In the US, for example, of the 1,350 known or identified geothermal systems, 5% are above 150{degrees}C, and 85% are below 90{degrees}C (Muffler, 1979). In fact, almost every country in the world has some low-temperature systems; while, only a few have accessible high-temperature systems.","","","","","","United States","1996-08-01T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: Geo-Heat Center Quarterly Bulletin; Journal Volume: 17; Journal Issue: 3; Other Information: PBD: Aug 1996","","Medium: X; Size: pp. 6-9","","","","Journal ID: GCQBDW; ISSN 0276-1084; TRN: 97:000139-0002","","","2009-12-16T00:00:00Z","508609","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/508609","","Geo-Heat Center Quarterly Bulletin","3","17"
"Selected cost considerations for geothermal district heating in existing single-family residential areas","Rafferty, K","15 GEOTHERMAL ENERGY; GEOTHERMAL ENERGY; COST; RESOURCE POTENTIAL; HOUSES; GEOTHERMAL SPACE HEATING","District heating in existing single-family residential areas has long been considered to be uneconomical due to the low heating load density. In comparison to the typical downtown business districts load density is low; however, there are some characteristics of residential areas which could serve to enhance the economics of district heating. Among these are: (1) wide variety of heating fuels (and costs) which can result in a range of conventional heating costs of 3 or more to 1 for the same heating load density, (2) availability of unpaved areas for installation of distribution system, (3) fewer utilities in the pipeline corridor, (4) less traffic control requirements during construction, (5) potential for the use of uninsulated piping, and (6) older, poorly insulated structures with high energy use. In addition to these considerations, the Geo-Heat Center has recently completed work which identified 271 western US population centers which are collocated with geothermal resources of greater than 50{degrees}C. In many of these sites, due to the absence of industrial facilities, district heating would be the most useful application of the resource. With these factors in mind, this report explores some of the issues related costs involved in the installation of geothermal district heating (GDH) in existing single-family residential areas. Using an actual residential area as an example, individual sections of the report examine: (1) distribution piping costs and potential savings areas, (2) central plant vs. individual-home heat exchangers, (3) customer branch lines costs, and (4) current conventional heating costs vs. district system debt service revenue requirements.","","","","","","United States","1996-08-01T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: Geo-Heat Center Quarterly Bulletin; Journal Volume: 17; Journal Issue: 3; Other Information: PBD: Aug 1996","","Medium: X; Size: pp. 10-15","","","","Journal ID: GCQBDW; ISSN 0276-1084; TRN: 97:000139-0003","","","2009-12-16T00:00:00Z","508610","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/508610","","Geo-Heat Center Quarterly Bulletin","3","17"

These wells supply all of the heating and part of the cooling needs of the 11-building, 62,200 m{sup 2} (670,000 ft{sup 2}) campus. The combined capacity of the well pumps is 62 L/s(980 gpm) of 89{degrees}C (192{degrees}F) geothermal fluids. Swimming pool and domestic hot water heating impose a small but nearly constant year-round flow requirement. In addition to heating, a portion of the campus is also cooled using the geothermal resource. This is accomplished through the use of an absorption chiller. The chiller, which operates on the same principle as a gas refrigerator, requires a flow of 38 L/s (600 gpm) of geothermal fluid and produces 541 kW (154 tons) of cooling capacity (Rafferty, 1989). The annual operating costs for the system is about $35,000 including maintenance salary, equipment replacement and cost of pumping.

The rangefront comprises four imbricate lithologic packages. The Triassic Star Peak Group sits structurally lowest beneath Triassic phyllite of the Fencemaker-B allochthon. Bedded quartz arenite of the Jurassic Boyer Ranch Formation lies above the phyllite along the Boyer thrust. Rocks of the Humboldt Igneous Complex sit structurally highest in brittle fault contact with both the arenite and phyllite. The Fenoemaker thrust is a major Jurassic structure in west-central Nevada which places Triassic basinal strata northeastward over shelf carbonates of the Star Peak Group, which depositionally overlie the Golconda allochthon. Locally, the Fencemaker thrust lies within a high strain zone characterized by mylonitic marble, phlogopite-bearing calcareous argillite schist, boudinaged siliciclastics, and phyllonite. Consistently southeast-dipping penetrative foliations and down-dip stretching lineations in these Triassic metasedimentary rocks are, however, inconsistent with northeast directed thrusting. This suggests that northwest vergent thrusting also occurred here, possibly along the Willow Creek thrust. In contrast to the Fencemaker thrust, the Boyer thrust is characterized by close folds in the hanging wall, a narrow zone of fault gouge, and crenulation of footwall foliations, indicating a less ductile regime. East dipping Tertiary extensional faults expose these thrusts along the Stillwater rangefront and displace the thrust sheets downdip beneath Dixie Valley. The geometry of these thrust sheets in the subsurface is critical to the production of geothermal wells in the area.","","","","","","United States","1996-06-01T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: AAPG Bulletin; Journal Volume: 80; Journal Issue: 6; Conference: American Association of Petroleum Geologogists (AAPG) Rocky Mountain section meeting, Billings, MT (United States), 28-31 Jul 1996; Other Information: PBD: Jun 1996","","Medium: X; Size: pp. 979a","","CONF-9607116-","","Journal ID: AABUD2; ISSN 0149-1423; TRN: 96:003409-0056","","","2009-12-16T00:00:00Z","272647","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/272647","","AAPG Bulletin","6","80"

Crystalline crusts are laminated slope deposits that formed abiotically following CO{sub 2} degassing from spring water. The formation of shrub travertine--irregular, dendritic precipitates from pool environments--is controversial and has been attributed to both abiotic and microbial processes. Oxygen isotope variation in the authors` travertines can be explained by abiotic processes, mainly CO{sub 2} degassing. In contrast, the carbon isotope data cannot be wholly explained by abiotic CO{sub 2} degassing invoked in earlier studies. Because photosynthesis is known to preferentially remove {sup 12}C, leaving ambient waters enriched in {sup 13}C, this fractionation should be recorded in {delta}{sup 13}C values of microbially influenced travertine. The shrub carbon isotope values are between 0.5% and 6.0% larger than values for associated abiotic precipitates, and this difference is probably caused by microbial activity. These isotope data support previous visual evidence that some shrub fabrics are microbially influenced.","","","","","","United States","1996-05-01T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: Journal of Sedimentary Research, Section A: Sedimentary Petrology and Processes; Journal Volume: 66; Journal Issue: 3; Other Information: PBD: May 1996","","Medium: X; Size: pp. 468-473","","","","Journal ID: JSRAEA; ISSN 1073-130X; TRN: IM9637%%53","","","2009-12-16T00:00:00Z","277594","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/277594","","Journal of Sedimentary Research, Section A: Sedimentary Petrology and Processes","3","66"

The method is based on molecular statics computation of energies for the formation of proton vacancies and interstitials in ideal periodic slabs representing the (100), (110), (010), (001), and (021) surfaces of goethite. Gas-phase energies of clusters representing the hydrolysis products of ferric iron are calculated using the same potential energy functions used for the surface. These energies are linearly related to the hydrolysis constants for ferric iron in aqueous solution. Stability constants for proton binding at goethite surfaces are estimated by assuming the same log K-{Delta}E relationship for goethite surface protonation reactions. These stability constants predict a pH of zero charge of 8.9, in adequate agreement with measurements on CO{sub 2}-free goethite. The estimated stability constants differ significantly from previous estimations based on Pauling bond strength. We find that nearly all the surface oxide ions are reactive; nineteen of the twenty-six surface sites investigated have log K{sup int} between 7.7 and 9.4. This implies a site density between fifteen and sixteen reactive sites/nm for crystals dominated by (110) and (021) crystal faces. 39 refs., 8 figs., 4 tabs.","","","","","","United States","1996-05-01T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: Geochimica et Cosmochimica Acta; Journal Volume: 60; Journal Issue: 9; Other Information: PBD: May 1996","","Medium: X; Size: pp. 1563-1576","","","AC06-76RL01830","Journal ID: GCACAK; ISSN 0016-7037; TRN: 97:000029-0002","10.1016/0016-7037(96)00035-X","","2009-12-16T00:00:00Z","486302","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/486302","","Geochimica et Cosmochimica Acta","9","60"

The potentials were taken from a previous investigation of Fe(III) in aqueous solutions which involved the extrapolation of the gas-phase Fe(III)-OH{sub 2} potential energy surface to the solvated hexaaqua complex. Using this model for the solid phases, lattice parameters for goethite, akaganeite, lepidocrocite, and hematite are generally within 4% of experiment. Internal energies (at 0 K) were computed for each structure; lepidocrocite is energetically the most stable polymorph, followed by akaganeite, with goethite being the least stable. While the model exhibits some variances with experiment, it performs remarkably well, despite the challenges constraint of being consistent with a dissociating molecular dynamics model for water in its gas, aqueous, and solid phases. Because of this consistency, the model allows qualitative theoretical treatment of previously unapproachable problems in mineral-water interface geochemistry. We apply the model to identify surface species on the solvated (110) surface of goethite. 29 refs., 5 figs., 3 tabs.","","","","","","United States","1996-05-01T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: Geochimica et Cosmochimica Acta; Journal Volume: 60; Journal Issue: 9; Other Information: PBD: May 1996","","Medium: X; Size: pp. 1553-1562","","","AC06-76RL01830","Journal ID: GCACAK; ISSN 0016-7037; TRN: 97:000029-0001","10.1016/0016-7037(96)00046-4","","2009-12-16T00:00:00Z","486301","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/486301","","Geochimica et Cosmochimica Acta","9","60"

"The Nevada geothermal industry - 1996","Flynn, T","15 GEOTHERMAL ENERGY; NEVADA; GEOTHERMAL RESOURCES; GEOTHERMAL INDUSTRY; EVALUATION; GEOTHERMAL POWER PLANTS; ECONOMICS; POWER GENERATION","Nevada ranks second in the United States for overall geothermal utilization and number one on a per capita basis. Nevada`s geothermal power plants generate approximately 210 megawatts (MWe) of electricity (gross), enough for about 200,000 households. Modern development began during the 1980s; but, geothermal utilization can be traced from prehistoric applications by indigenous Native Americans to modern uses. In July 1984, the first electricity generated from a Nevada geothermal resource occurred at Wabuska, in Lyon County. The binary electric power plant yielded an output of 600 kW, and the electricity was purchased by Sierra Pacific Power Company. Today, Nevada`s geothermal resources support twelve electric power plants at ten sites representing a total investment of approximately $450,000,000. Several large-scale direct-use projects have also provided significant economic and environmental benefits. Conservative estimates suggest that the 210 MWe presently produced in Nevada could easily be doubled or tripled, from identified existing geothermal resources if sufficient market demand exists.","","","","","","United States","1996-05-01T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: Geo-Heat Center Quarterly Bulletin; Journal Volume: 17; Journal Issue: 2; Other Information: PBD: May 1996","","Medium: X; Size: pp. 21-24","","","","Journal ID: GCQBDW; ISSN 0276-1084; TRN: 96:005367-0006","","","2009-12-16T00:00:00Z","440668","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/440668","","Geo-Heat Center Quarterly Bulletin","2","17"

Since the drier was to be used in a demonstration project to interest local fruit growers and processors, the size was minimal to expedite construction and minimize cost. The design was based on preliminary work reported by Herman Guillen. The design is described here, as it can be adapted to many small or experimental situations. The actual design will handle about 900 kg (2000 lbs) of fruit (wet) per drying cycle. Cutting, storing and packaging of the fruit should be done on site in a separate building. A cold-storage facility may be designed to keep fresh fruit when harvest exceeds the capacity of the drier.","","","","","","United States","1996-02-01T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: Geo-Heat Center Quarterly Bulletin; Journal Volume: 17; Journal Issue: 1; Other Information: PBD: Feb 1996","","Medium: X; Size: pp. 24-26","","","","Journal ID: GCQBDW; ISSN 0276-1084; TRN: 96:002790-0003","","","2009-12-16T00:00:00Z","245419","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/245419","","Geo-Heat Center Quarterly Bulletin","1","17"

The system extracts geothermal water to supply about ninety percent of the heat required for nine buildings in the downtown Boise area including the State Capitol. The cost savings over natural gas heating are estimated to be $400,000 per year. The primary components of the system are: (1) a production well, (2) heat exchangers, (3) underground delivery and collection pipes, and (4) an injection well. Production, temperature and system operation data have been recorded manually on Daily Logs since May, 1983. In 1991, the Department of Administration-Building Services made this data available through computer Trend Logs which capture information every six hours. The Capitol Mall geothermal system is located within the borders of an administrative district called the Boise Front Low Temperature Geothermal Resource Ground Water Management Area (GWMA) in Ada County of southwestern Idaho. The GWMA was established by the Idaho Department of Water Resources (IDWR) in 1987 in response to declining water levels in geothermal wells along the edge of the Boise foothills. In addition to the Capitol Mall system, the other major geothermal users in the Boise area are: (1) City of Boise, (2) Veterans Administration, and (3) Boise Warm Springs Water District. Collectively, these four users extract about 600 million gallons of geothermal water annually. Capitol Mall geothermal production accounts for about 160 to 205 million gallons of water annually. The supply temperature for the Capitol Mall system is currently about 155{degrees} Fahrenheit.","","","","","","United States","1996-02-01T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: Geo-Heat Center Quarterly Bulletin; Journal Volume: 17; Journal Issue: 1; Other Information: PBD: Feb 1996","","Medium: X; Size: pp. 19-23","","","","Journal ID: GCQBDW; ISSN 0276-1084; TRN: 96:002790-0002","","","2009-12-16T00:00:00Z","245418","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/245418","","Geo-Heat Center Quarterly Bulletin","1","17"

This paper attempts to update the previous survey carried out in 1990 by the same author and presented at the International Symposium in Hawaii. For each of these updates since 1975, the recording of data has been similar but not exactly the same and, for this latest update, an effort has been made to collate additional information on heat pumps and investments in geothermal for the past two decades. A preliminary version of this paper was published in the Proceedings of the World Geothermal Congress held in Florence in May 1995, which was prepared on the basis of draft manuscripts and information provided to the organizing committee prior to the meeting. However, some of these papers were modified on publication in the proceedings, and it was thought necessary to update this paper, particularly the tables, after the publication of the final manuscripts in the Proceedings of the Congress. What is evident from the papers received, is that there is a large potential for the development of low- to moderate-enthalpy direct use across the world which is not currently being exploited due to financial constraints and the low prices of competing energy. An estimate of the installed thermal power at the end of 1994 (1990 in brackets) from the current returns is 8,664 MWt (8,064 MWt) utilizing 37,050 kg/s (31,800 kg/s) of fluid, and the thermal energy used is 112,441 TJ/y (61,747 TJ/y).","","","","USDOE","","United States","1996-02-01T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: Geo-Heat Center Quarterly Bulletin; Journal Volume: 17; Journal Issue: 1; Other Information: PBD: Feb 1996","","Medium: X; Size: pp. 1-18","","","","Journal ID: GCQBDW; ISSN 0276-1084; TRN: 96:002790-0001","10.1016/0375-6505(95)00051-8","","2016-05-17T00:00:00Z","245417","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/245417","","Geo-Heat Center Quarterly Bulletin","1","17"

The heavy rainfall in the first half of 1995 altered the long-term production and injection patterns and underscored the need to increase injection in the field. From January to June 1995, steam production at The Geysers was reduced by 37 percent form the amount produced during the same period in 1994--because the rain increased availability of hydroelectric power. At the same time, water injection in the field rose by 25 percent because more rainwater was available for injection. Consequently, both reservoir pressure and available steam reserves grew, and most power plants that returned on line in the second half of the year produced more megawatts with less steam. This confirmed findings form several injection studies at The Geyser`s.","","","","","","United States","1996-01-01T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: Geothermal Hot Line; Journal Volume: 22; Journal Issue: 1; Other Information: PBD: Jan 1996","","Medium: X; Size: pp. 12-14","","","","Journal ID: GHLIDT; ISSN 0735-0503; TRN: 96:001945-0003","","","2009-12-16T00:00:00Z","232026","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/232026","","Geothermal Hot Line","1","22"

The field is at the southern end of a network of irrigated agricultural fields extending across the valley floor. The Heber geothermal system is circular, producing water of moderate temperature (360{degrees}F) and low-salinity (13,000-14,000 ppm TDS). In cross section, the geothermal system resembles a lopsided mushroom. The system has three major permeability units: capping clays form 500 to 1800 feet; a high-matrix-permeability, deltaic-sandstone outflow reservoir from 1,800 to 5,500 feet; and feeder faults and fractures in indurated sediments below 5,500 feet. The deltaic sandstones were deposited by the ancestral Colorado River. As both power plants continue operating in Heber field, the need persists to monitor subsidence and uplift. The field`s subsidence bowl is not expected to expand significantly, but some small changes are expected due to pressure changes caused by production for the SIGC binary power plant. The three SIGC injection wells, located between the production areas for the two power plants, will be managed for adequate reservoir pressure support.","","","","","","United States","1996-01-01T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: Geothermal Hot Line; Journal Volume: 22; Journal Issue: 1; Other Information: PBD: Jan 1996","","Medium: X; Size: pp. 15-26","","","","Journal ID: GHLIDT; ISSN 0735-0503; TRN: 96:001945-0004","","","2009-12-16T00:00:00Z","232027","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/232027","","Geothermal Hot Line","1","22"

The presence of skeletal crystals of calcite (three types--trigonal prisms, hexagonal prisms, and plates) and trona in hot (> 90 C) spring deposits in New Zealand (Waikite Springs and Ohaaki Pool) and Kenya (Lorusio hot springs) shows that they can form in natural sedimentary regimes. Analysis of samples from these deposits shows that this crystal morphology develops under disequilibrium conditions that are unrelated to a specific environmental or diagenetic setting. Skeletal crystals transform into solid crystals when subsequent precipitation fills their hollow cores. In some cases, this may involve precipitation of crystalline material that has a sieve-like texture. In other examples, the skeletal crystal provides a framework upon which other materials can be precipitated. Walls in the skeletal trigonal calcite prisms from Waikite Springs are formed of subcrystals that mimic the shape of the parent crystal. Similarly, plate-like skeletal crystals from Lorusio are formed of densely packed subcrystals that are < 0.5 {micro}m long. Conversely, the walls of the skeletal hexagonal calcite crystals from Ohaaki Pool and the skeletal trona crystals from Lorusio are not formed of subcrystals. Recognition of skeletal crystals is important because they represent growth that follows the reverse pattern of normal growth. Failure to recognize that crystal growth followed the skeletal motif may lead to false interpretations concerning the growth of a crystal.","","","","","","United States","1996-01-01T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: Journal of Sedimentary Research, Section A: Sedimentary Petrology and Processes; Journal Volume: 66; Journal Issue: 1; Other Information: PBD: Jan 1996","","Medium: X; Size: pp. 265-274","","","","Journal ID: JSRAEA; ISSN 1073-130X; TRN: IM9616%%209","","","2009-12-16T00:00:00Z","207881","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/207881","","Journal of Sedimentary Research, Section A: Sedimentary Petrology and Processes","1","66"

Using 3-D numerical models, the authors evaluate four EM techniques for use in geothermal exploration: magnetotellurics (MT), controlled-source audio magnetotellurics (CSAMT), long-offset time-domain EM (LOTEM), and short-offset time-domain EM (TEM). Their results show that all of these techniques can delineate the clay cap, but non can be said to unequivocally detect the reservoir. They do find, however, that the EM anomaly from a deep, conductive reservoir overlain by a larger, more conductive clay cap is caused by the presence of the electric charge at conductivity boundaries rather than electromagnetic induction. This means that, for detection of the reservoir, methods such as MT, which rely on electric field measurements, are superior to those where only the magnetic field is measured. The anomaly produced by boundary charges at the reservoir is subtle and will be evident only if high-quality data are collected at closely spaced measurement sites. LOTEM electric field measurements look promising and should be useful when efficient multidimensional tools are developed for LOTEM interpretation. Although CSAMT employs electric field measurements, this method is not recommended for reservoir detection because the anomaly caused by a deep reservoir is obscured by transmitter effects that cannot be isolated reliably. A combination of CSAMT and TEM measurements appears most appropriate for delineation of the clay cap.","","","","","","United States","1996-01-01T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: Geophysics; Journal Volume: 61; Journal Issue: 1; Other Information: PBD: Jan-Feb 1996","","Medium: X; Size: pp. 121-130","","","","Journal ID: GPYSA7; ISSN 0016-8033; TRN: IM9616%%166","10.1190/1.1443931","","2009-12-16T00:00:00Z","207838","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/207838","","Geophysics","1","61"

In previous studies a number of different relationships between the normal stress on the crack, the fluid pressure, and the crack height (so-called crack laws) have been used, as have different ``flow laws`` to determine the relationship between flow rate and crack geometry. Here it is shown that the choice of submodel may have profound implications for the mathematical structure of the problem. In particular, two crack laws (a linear law and a hyperbolic law) are considered as well as two flow laws (a cubic law and a linear law). The model contains a dimensionless parameter that measures the relative importance of stresses due to local deformation of asperities and the long-range deformation of the crack surface. The case is considered where the former is the dominant mechanism. A perturbation analysis is performed, and it is found that for some combinations of laws a strained-coordinate analysis is required, while for others a matched asymptotic approach is needed. In the latter case the problem may be reduced to that of solving a linear, nonhomogeneous singular integrodifferential equation to determine the behavior in the boundary layer. This problem is solved, and some conclusions are drawn regarding the relevance of various laws to flow in HDRGERs.","","","","USDOE","","United States","1995-12-01T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: SIAM Journal of Applied Mathematics; Journal Volume: 55; Journal Issue: 6; Other Information: PBD: Dec 1995","","Medium: X; Size: pp. 1592-1608","","","","Journal ID: SMJMAP; ISSN 0036-1399; TRN: IM9553%%62","10.1137/S0036139993260241","","2016-05-04T00:00:00Z","137060","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/137060","","SIAM Journal of Applied Mathematics","6","55"

This organism, designated SA-01, clustered most closely with members of the genus Thermus, as determined by 16S rDNA gene sequence analysis. The 16S rDNA sequence of SA-01 was >98% similar to that of Thermus strain NMX2 A.1, which was previously isolated by other investigators from a thermal spring in New Mexico. Strain NMX2 A.1 was also able to reduce Fe(III) and other electron acceptors, whereas Thermus aquaticus (ATCC 25104) and Thermus filiformis (ATCC 43280) did not reduce NO{sub 3}{sup -} or Fe(III). Neither SA-01 nor NMX2 A.1 grew fermentatively, i.e., addition of an external electron acceptor was required for anaerobic growth. Thermus SA-01 reduced soluble Fe(III) complexed with citrate or nitrilotriacetic acid (NTA); however, it could only reduce relatively small quantities (0.5 mM) of hydrous ferric oxide (HFO) except when the humic acid analog 2,6-anthraquinone disulfonate (AQDS) was added as an electron shuttle, in which case 10 mM Fe(III) was reduced. Fe(III)-NTA was reduced quantitatively to Fe(II), was coupled to the oxidation of lactate, and could support growth through three consecutive transfers. Suspensions of Thermus SA-01 cells also reduced Mn(IV), Co(III)-EDTA, Cr(VI), and AQDS. Mn(IV)-oxide was reduced in the presence of either lactate or H{sub 2}. Both strains were also able to mineralize NTA to CO{sub 2} and to couple its oxidation to Fe(III) reduction and growth. The optimum temperature for growth and Fe(III) reduction by Thermus SA-01 and NMX2 A.1 is approximately 65 C; optimum pH is 6.5 to 7.0. This is the first report of a Thermus sp. being able to couple the oxidation of organic compounds to the reduction of Fe, Mn or S.","","","Pacific Northwest National Lab.

Lower drilling costs are achieved primarily by the faster penetration rates, reduced nondrilling time, and reduced mud volume requirements associated with underbalanced drilling. Greater well productivity can sometimes be obtained because of reduced formation damage for mud. Recent advances in rotating head technology have increased the range of well conditions to which this technology can be applied. Even though the use of rotating control heads is growing rapidly, this topic has been largely neglected in most well control training programs. Many engineers are not yet familiar with this important emerging technology and some of the modern concepts and practices used. The paper discusses the high-pressure rotating head and its application to gas or air drilling, flow drilling, geothermal drilling, overbalanced drilling and workover operations. The paper also discusses operating guidelines and rig crew training.","","","","","","United States","1995-10-09T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: Oil and Gas Journal; Journal Volume: 93; Journal Issue: 41; Other Information: PBD: 9 Oct 1995","","Medium: X; Size: pp. 72-77","","","","Journal ID: OIGJAV; ISSN 0030-1388; TRN: IM9545%%475","","","2009-12-16T00:00:00Z","116505","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/116505","","Oil and Gas Journal","41","93"

Mass-transfer coefficients, instead of the heat-transfer coefficients, on the packed particles in the slit and on the slit wall were measured by making use of the electrochemical method. The results indicate that the mass-transfer coefficient on the particles increases with decreasing void fraction and approaches that in a usual packed bed. The mass-transfer coefficient at the wall increases also with decreasing void fraction.

"Fluid inclusion and isotopic systematics of an evolving magmatic-hydrothermal system","Moore, J N; Gunderson, R P","15 GEOTHERMAL ENERGY; GEYSERS GEOTHERMAL FIELD; RESERVOIR ROCK; FLUID FLOW; VAPOR-DOMINATED SYSTEMS; GEOCHEMISTRY; CALIFORNIA; GEOTHERMAL RESOURCES; INCLUSIONS","The Geysers, California, is the site of a long-lived hydrothermal system that initially developed 1.5-2 m.y. ago in response to the intrusion of a hypabyssal granitic pluton. Although wells drilled into The Geysers produce only dry steam, fluid inclusion, isotopic, and mineralogic data demonstrate that the present vapor-dominated regime evolved from an earlier and more extensive, liquid-dominated hydrothermal system. Circulation of these early fluids produced veins characterized by tourmaline {+-} biotite {+-} actinolite {+-} clinopyroxene within the pluton and adjacent biotite-rich hornfels, actinolite {+-} ferroaxinite {+-} epidote and epidote {+-} chlorite within the intermediate parts of the thermal system and calcite in the outer parts. Potassium feldspar and quartz are present in all assemblages. Pressure-corrected homogenization temperatures and apparent salinities of fluid inclusions trapped in vein minerals range from 440{degrees}C and 44 wt% NaCl equivalent within the hornfels (<600 m from the pluton) to 325{degrees}C and 5 wt% NaCl equivalent at distances of approximately 1500 m from the intrusion. We suggest that the shallow, moderate salinity fluids are connate waters modified by water-rock interactions while the high-salinity fluids are interpreted as magmatic brines. Halite-dissolution temperatures of inclusions in the hornfels and pluton indicate that the magnetic fluids were trapped at lithostatic pressures (300-900 bars). In contrast, homogenization temperatures of the connate fluids suggest trapping under hydrostatic pressures of less than several hundred bars. Whole-rock {delta}{sup 18}O values of samples from The Geysers display systematic variations with respect to depth, location within the field, and grade of alteration. At depths below +610 m relative to mean sea level, the {delta}{sup 18}O values are strongly zoned around a northwest-southeast trending low located near the center of the steam reservoir. 77 refs., 15 figs., 2 tabs.","","","","","","United States","1995-10-01T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: Geochimica et Cosmochimica Acta; Journal Volume: 59; Journal Issue: 19; Other Information: PBD: Oct 1995","","Medium: X; Size: pp. 3887-3907","","","AC07-90ID12929","Journal ID: GCACAK; ISSN 0016-7037; TRN: 96:006005-0001","10.1016/0016-7037(95)00289-C","","2009-12-16T00:00:00Z","505161","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/505161","","Geochimica et Cosmochimica Acta","19","59"

Numerous resources occur in the areas indicated in Figure 1, with individual reservoir areas one to ten square miles in extent. In the northern Great Plains, major aquifers with fluid temperatures exceeding 50{degrees}C extend in a continuous manner for thousands of square miles. Geothermal resources also occur at certain locations in the east. The last major effort in assessing the national potential of low-temperature geothermal resources occurred in the early 1980s. Since that time, substantial resource information has been gained through drilling hydrologic, environmental, petroleum and geothermal projects; but there has been no significant effort to update information on low-temperature geothermal resources. While there has been a substantial increase (49%) in direct-heat (excluding geothermal heat pumps) utilization during the last decade, the large resource base (266 Quads, the U.S. uses about 80 Quads/yr) is greatly under-utilized. Since the thermal energy extracted from these resources must be used near the reservoir, collocation of the resource and user is required.","","","","","","United States","1995-10-01T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: Geo-Heat Center Quarterly Bulletin; Journal Volume: 16; Journal Issue: 4; Other Information: PBD: Oct 1995","","Medium: X; Size: pp. 15-22","","","","Journal ID: GCQBDW; ISSN 0276-1084; TRN: 96:000025-0003","","","2009-12-16T00:00:00Z","160012","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/160012","","Geo-Heat Center Quarterly Bulletin","4","16"

Our survey included the two major ridge segments north and south of the Clipperton Transform Fault at about 10{degrees}10{prime}, both limbs of the overlapping spreading centers (OSC`s) at 9{degrees}03 {prime}N and 11{degrees}45{prime}N, and a 30-km section of the next ridge segment to the south. We found vigorous plumes along most of this ridge axis, in keeping with its magmatically robust cross-section, axial summit caldera, and shallow, magma-related seismic reflector. These plumes were detectable by both physical (temperature and light attenuation) and chemical (dissolved Mn and CH{sub 4}) measurements, although the chemical measurements were more sensitive. The least active sections were the southern third of the northern segment from 10{degrees}20 to 52{prime}N and the OSCs, especially the OSC at 11{degrees}45{prime}N. Plumes there had weak Mn and CH{sub 4} signals and were barely detectable by physical methods. These axial sections were the only ones surveyed that lie deeper than 2600 m and appear to be magma starved. The most active sections on the northern segment gave stronger signals for Mn and temperature than for CH{sub 4} and light attenuation, whereas the opposite was true on the southern segment, which was the site of a volcanic eruption at 9{degrees}45-52{prime}N only seven months prior to our cruise. On the northern segment the four physical and chemical plume tracers correlated positively and linearly with one another, suggesting that the segment was fed by relatively uniform end-member fluids with a mean CH{sub 4}/Mn molar ratio of 0.075. 61 refs., 12 figs., 1 tab.","","","","","","United States","1995-10-01T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: Geochimica et Cosmochimica Acta; Journal Volume: 59; Journal Issue: 20; Other Information: PBD: Oct 1995","","Medium: X; Size: pp. 4147-4165","","","","Journal ID: GCACAK; ISSN 0016-7037; TRN: 96:006049-0001","10.1016/0016-7037(95)00245-U","","2009-12-16T00:00:00Z","482172","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/482172","","Geochimica et Cosmochimica Acta","20","59"

Induction periods for the nucleation of barium sulfate were experimentally determined as a function of supersaturation in NaCl solutions from 0 to 6 m at 25 C and in 1.0 m NaCl solutions at temperatures from 25 to 90 C. Employing the classical nucleation theory, the interfacial tension between barite and supersaturated solutions with NaCl was estimated to be about 93 mJ/m{sup 2} (less than 0.003 m NaCl) and 79 mJ/m{sup 2} (1 m NaCl) at 25 C. It decreases slightly with increasing temperature (to 71 mJ/m{sup 2} in 1 m NaCl solutions at 90 C). It was observed that the induction period decreases with increasing NaCl concentrations to 3 mm and then starts to increase slightly at a given temperature and saturation index. The electrolyte effect on nucleation was proportional to the enhanced solubility of barium sulfate in NaCl solutions. This phenomenon may result from decreased crystal-solution interfacial tensions caused by increased barite solubility in electrolyte solutions.

In the case of NaCl electrolyte solutions, the induction period only decreases to 1 m and then starts to increase to 6 m, probably because of substitution of small ions (Na{sup +}) into SrSO{sub 4} nuclei and the crystal lattice. The accelerated nucleation rate of SrSO{sub 4} in electrolyte solutions was a result of enhanced solubility of SrSO{sub 4} and resultant lowered interfacial tension. Threshold inhibitors 1-hydroxyethylidene-1,1-diphosphonic acid (HEDP), bishexamethylenetriaminetetra (methylene) phosphonic acid (BHTP), and phosphinopolycarboxylic acid (PPPC) are effective in inhibiting SrSO{sub 4} nucleation in NaCl solutions. Prolonged induction periods in the presence of inhibitors can be interpreted in terms of an elevation in the interfacial tension (up to 90 mJ/m{sup 2} with 10 mg/liter HEDP).","","","","","","United States","1995-09-15T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: Journal of Colloid and Interface Science; Journal Volume: 174; Journal Issue: 2; Other Information: PBD: 15 Sep 1995","","Medium: X; Size: pp. 327-335","","","","Journal ID: JCISA5; ISSN 0021-9797; TRN: IM9542%%323","10.1006/jcis.1995.1398","","2009-12-16T00:00:00Z","106235","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/106235","","Journal of Colloid and Interface Science","2","174"

The LCPC slurries consisted of calcium aluminate cement (CAC) as the base reactant, a {single_bond}({single_bond}NaPO{sub 3}{single_bond}){single_bond}{sub n} solution as the acid reactant, and mullite-shelled hollow microspheres as the lightweight additive. Two major aspects were studied; one was the importance of the chemical constituents of CAC, and the other was the rate of the hydrothermal reaction between the mullite shell and the Na ions dissociated from {single_bond}({single_bond}NaPO{sub 3}{single_bond}){single_bond}{sub n}. For the former, the use of CAC having C{sub 2}AS and CA phases as the major chemical components shortened the thickening time of LCPC slurries, whereas CACs with CA, CA{sub 2}, and {alpha}-Al{sub 2}O{sub 3} phase components extended the thickening time. For the hydrothermal reaction, an excess of zeolite X type formed by the uptake of Na by mullite microspheres reduced the thickening time.","","","","","","United States","1995-08-01T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: Cement and Concrete Research; Journal Volume: 25; Journal Issue: 6; Other Information: PBD: Aug 1995","","Medium: X; Size: pp. 1305-1310","","","","Journal ID: CCNRAI; ISSN 0008-8846; TRN: IM9538%%371","10.1016/0008-8846(95)00123-T","","2009-12-16T00:00:00Z","94397","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/94397","","Cement and Concrete Research","6","25"

Of the 700 mud volcanoes known in the world, 220 are in Azerbaijan. These are of great interest, not least in relation to oil and gas exploration since they give information on subsurface sediments beyond the reach of drilling. Mud volcanoes are clearly visible on satellite images. They are confined to structural lineaments and associated fractures. Changes in the morphology of some mud volcanoes post-eruption can be detected from a series of images pre-dating and post-dating eruptions. Mud volcanoes are notable for gradients of temperature that are by an order of magnitude or a factor of 102 greater than the temperature gradients established elsewhere. The gases of mud volcanoes consist mainly of methane (95-100%). There are small amounts of C{sub 2-6}, CO{sub 2}, N{sub 2}, He and Ar. The isotopic composition of carbon (ICC) within the methane varies from -61.29. to -35.W{close_quotes} which is isotopically heavier than the methane from producing fields. The ICC of the CO{sub 2} has a very wide range (from -49.6% to +23.1%), indicating several sources of its formation. The isotopically superheavy CO{sub 2} (+5%) is especially interesting. Oils from mud volcanoes are typically severely biodegraded. Their ICC ranges from -24.76% to -28.2%. A relationship between {partial_derivative}{sup l3}C of oils and ages of accumulations has been established. Waters of mud volcanoes are lightly mineralised, containing chiefly bicarbonates and sodium. The hydrogen composition of the water is abnormally heavy. Ejected rocks from mud volcanoes range in age from Cretaceous - Pliocene. Their study suggests that deeply buried reservoirs maintain good poroperm characteristics because of relatively little catagenesis.","","","","","","United States","1995-08-01T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: AAPG Bulletin; Journal Volume: 79; Journal Issue: 8; Conference: International conference and exhibition of the American Association of Petroleum Geologists, Inc.: managing change at the turn of the century, Nice (France), 10-13 Sep 1995; Other Information: PBD: Aug 1995","","Medium: X; Size: pp. 1219.a","","CONF-950995-","","Journal ID: AABUD2; ISSN 0149-1423; TRN: 95:005942-0127","","","2009-12-16T00:00:00Z","127432","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/127432","","AAPG Bulletin","8","79"

Since the change of resistivity across the contact can distort or obscure the transient electromagnetic (TEM) response of the target, it is important to understand the possible effects. Previous investigators have examined similar problems using scale models. For example, Spies and Parker (1984) studied the TEM responses of fixed-loop and moving-loop configurations to geological contacts with lateral resistivity variations. More recently, Wilt (1991) systematically studied TEM soundings near a geological contact and observed that different survey systems respond to the contact in different ways. This paper will illustrate the use of the finite-difference, time-domain (FDTD) algorithm of Wang and Hohmann (1993) for calculating the TEM response of a 3-D conductive body at a geological contact. The algorithm is based on the Yee staggered grid FDTD method for solving the transient electrical nonmagnetic field responses of a 3-D model. On a suitable computer, a wide range of model responses can be readily calculated, a versatility that scale modeling does not share. This study uses a fixed transmitter loop, roving-receiver configuration. Many other configurations can be regarded as special cases of this survey. It is commonly employed, for instance, by the Newmont EMP (Body and Wiles, 1984), UTEM (West et al., 1984), and Geonics EM37 systems. The configuration also facilitates finite-difference, time-domain modeling because it does not require frequent movement of the source.","","","","","","United States","1995-07-01T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: Geophysics; Journal Volume: 60; Journal Issue: 4; Other Information: PBD: Jul-Aug 1995","","Medium: X; Size: pp. 1265-1269","","","","Journal ID: GPYSA7; ISSN 0016-8033; TRN: IM9540%%231","10.1190/1.1443859","","2009-12-16T00:00:00Z","100757","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/100757","","Geophysics","4","60"

Geothermal energy, wastes burning, cogeneration, energy recovery and integrative boilers have properly been matched. A previous analysis and simulation of the plants working allowed the authors to choose the size of each sub-system and to foresee the operation results throughout the year.

"Geothermal district heating and cooling in Vicenza, Italy","Leoni, P","15 GEOTHERMAL ENERGY; ITALY; GEOTHERMAL HEATING SYSTEMS; GEOTHERMAL AIR CONDITIONING; TECHNOLOGY ASSESSMENT; GEOTHERMAL POWER PLANTS; PERFORMANCE; HEAT PUMPS","The discovery of a large low-enthalpy geothermal water reservoir under the city of Vicenza (110,000 people) in northern Italy, through an oil prospecting venture, opened up the opportunity to install a district heating system with low energy consumption. Although the geothermal water is at 67{degrees}C, this is insufficient for heating the city`s commercial and residential buildings using their existing high-temperature heat distribution systems. Heat pumps are, therefore, used to obtain optimum useful heat energy from the geothermal source. Experience so far suggests that the system can reduce energy consumption by up to 60%, or 3885 MWh/year. The 2000 m deep well was completed in 1983 and is the first such well in Italy to be located within an urban area, making it ideal as a heat source for a district heating system. It produces 100 m{sup 3}/h of low salt-content water. The {open_quotes}Vicenza{close_quotes} geothermal heating and cooling project was developed by {open_quotes}Aziende Industriali Muncipalizzate{close_quotes} from 1988 to 1991, a utility company owned by the city of Vicenza, with the purpose of distributing approximately 40,000 MWh year to residential and commercial buildings. The project includes the installation of a power plant, and a district heating and cooling network. A reduction in the consumption of conventional fuels both for heating and domestic water has been achieved through a highly-efficient thermodynamic system based on reversible heat pumps. The system provides heating in the winter and air conditioning in summer.","","","","","","United States","1995-06-01T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: Geo-Heat Center Quarterly Bulletin; Journal Volume: 16; Journal Issue: 3; Other Information: PBD: Jun 1995","","Medium: X; Size: pp. 7-9","","","","Journal ID: GCQBDW; ISSN 0276-1084; TRN: 95:005253-0002","","","2009-12-16T00:00:00Z","90748","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/90748","","Geo-Heat Center Quarterly Bulletin","3","16"

Higher heat flow (>100 mW m{sup -2}) is characteristic of the north-central Great Basin (the Battle Mountain High, BMH) and several smaller areas along its margins. There is also a large area of lower heat flow (<60 mW m{sup -2}, the Eureka Low, EL) in the south-central portion of the province. There is hydrologic and thermal evidence that the EL is a shallow ({approximately}3 km) hydrologically controlled heat sink associated with interbasin water flow. For example, the temperature profile from a 3.7 km deep hole at Pahute Mesa in the EL indicates low heat flow in the upper 1.5 km and high heat flow in the lowermost kilometer. On the other hand, seismic and magnetic studies suggest that the heat sink in the EL extends to at least mid-crustal depths. Temperatures in the deeper parts of many basins in the BMH are higher than considered favorable for generation or stability of oil. Paradoxically, temperature-gradients as high as 100{degrees}C km{sup -1} and an underlying hydrothermal system are found within the EL in Railroad Valley, the site of the most productive oil-fields in the Great Basin. The heat source driving this hydrothermal system is a combination of local upward flow from the Paleozoic carbonate aquifer and possible thermal input from nearby igneous activity. J. B. Hulen and others have suggested that the Railroad Valley hydrothermal system has enhanced hydrocarbon transport and accelerated maturation. If a hydrothermal system is required for the formation of significant hydrocarbon reservoirs in the EL, then such reservoirs will occur only where groundwater flow in the carbonate aquifer is not removing heat from the basins.","","","","","","United States","1995-06-01T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: AAPG Bulletin; Journal Volume: 79; Journal Issue: 6; Conference: American Association of Petroleum Geologists (AAPG) Rocky Mountain Section meeting, Reno, NV (United States), 16-19 Jul 1995; Other Information: PBD: Jun 1995","","Medium: X; Size: pp. 924b","","CONF-9507131-","","Journal ID: AABUD2; ISSN 0149-1423; TRN: 95:004859-0079","","","2009-12-16T00:00:00Z","86676","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/86676","","AAPG Bulletin","6","79"

The concentrated heat which drives these systems is commonly viewed as a negative influence: in other words, any oil initially present in or generated by these systems is quickly degraded to a useless carbonaceous residue. This is true in extreme cases, but numerous examples from the Great Basin, the northern California Coast Ranges, and elsewhere suggest that under certain circumstances, geothermal systems can efficiently generate, transport, and entrap significant quantities of producible petroleum. B.R.T. Simoneit has shown that oil can be hydrothermally generated in an {open_quotes} instant{close_quotes} of geologic time. It follows, then, that away from geothermal systems` high-temperature centers (or in wholly moderate-temperature systems), the encompassing shallow thermal anomalies can distill large volumes of oil from otherwise immature hydrocarbon source rocks. Transport of this newly-generated oil is enhanced by the buoyant upwelling of heated aqueous fluid. Porosity for oil transport and storage is created or increased by hydrothermal dissolution of rock-forming or secondary silicates and carbonates. Finally, geothermal {open_quotes}self-sealing{close_quotes} -- the deposition of secondary minerals (especially silica and clay) at the margins of a system -- can provide a very effective hydrocarbon seal. Lee Allison has noted the coincidence of igneous intrusions and oil reservoirs in Nevada. It is suggested that here and elsewhere, both igneous-related and amagmatic geothermal systems in otherwise favorable settings should be viewed as prime petroleum exploration targets.","","","","","","United States","1995-06-01T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: AAPG Bulletin; Journal Volume: 79; Journal Issue: 6; Conference: American Association of Petroleum Geologists (AAPG) Rocky Mountain Section meeting, Reno, NV (United States), 16-19 Jul 1995; Other Information: PBD: Jun 1995","","Medium: X; Size: pp. 919","","CONF-9507131-","","Journal ID: AABUD2; ISSN 0149-1423; TRN: 95:004859-0063","","","2009-12-16T00:00:00Z","86660","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/86660","","AAPG Bulletin","6","79"

Chemical and fluid inclusion data demonstrate that production is from a narrow, asymmetric plume of thermal water that originates from a deep reservoir to the south and then flows laterally to the north. Geologic controls on the geometry of the upwelling plume were investigated using petrographic and analytical analyses of reservoir rock and vein material. The nature of the low-angle outflow zone and the overlying cap that prevents a surface expression of the geothermal system appears to be related to a combination of lithologic, structural and mineralogic factors. The position of the outflow plume is partially controlled by the distribution of fractured crystalline intrusives within foliated metamorphic rocks. Intrusive-metamorphic lithologic contacts are characterized by sericite-pyrite alteration and correlate with fluid entries in the wells. The base of a thick intrusive unit in several wells coincides with the 250{degrees}C isotherm based on fluid inclusion data. A smectite clay zone developed in the overlying metamorphic rock acts as a cap to the productive zone and inhibits vertical movement of the geothermal fluids above the main upwelling zone. The upwelling zone lies within a epidote-quartz veined, coarse-grained granite at depth in the southern portion of the field. The mineralogy of the clays varies systematically with depth and temperature. The distribution of fine-grained clay minerals with depth indicates that the smectite cap thickens dramatically from the north to the south, and overlies a strongly sericitized zone in the upwelling portion of the reservoir. Wairakite-chlorite-epidote-calcite-quartz veins at the contact with the deep granite record deposition from the hottest geothermal fluids (342{degrees}C) in the Coso field.","","","","","","United States","1995-06-01T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: AAPG Bulletin; Journal Volume: 79; Journal Issue: 6; Conference: American Association of Petroleum Geologists (AAPG) Rocky Mountain Section meeting, Reno, NV (United States), 16-19 Jul 1995; Other Information: PBD: Jun 1995","","Medium: X; Size: pp. 922a","","CONF-9507131-","","Journal ID: AABUD2; ISSN 0149-1423; TRN: 95:004859-0071","","","2009-12-16T00:00:00Z","86668","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/86668","","AAPG Bulletin","6","79"

The {delta}D and {delta}{sup 18}O values of mica (sericite), mica-smectite, chlorite, chlorite-smectite, nacrite, dickite, kaolinite, and smectite were used to deduce the type(s) of hydrothermal fluid at each locality. Calculated compositions for Minamishiraoi and Kagenosawa fluids suggest that seawater was dominant, but some mixing with magmatic water is also indicated, particularly for the polymetallic Kagenosawa deposit. Hydrothermal fluids at Date, Chitose, and the Noboribetsu geothermal area were dominated by meteoric water. The {delta}D and {delta}{sup 18}O values of modern hot-spring waters at Noboribetsu closely parallel fluid compositions calculated for the clay alteration at Date, Chitose, and Noboribetsu. In vacuo TG patterns of other smectitic clays suggested gradual loss of hydroxyl-groups beginning near 200{degrees}C, rather than the more typical distinct separation between interlayer water at <200{degrees}C and hydroxyl-groups at >400{degrees}C. This behaviour constrains the maximum temperature that can be used for in vacuo preheating. Furthermore, shifts to lower {delta}D values (by as much as 19{per_thousand}) were obtained when this smectite was dispersed in low-D water for three weeks, perhaps indicating isotopic exchange. However, with appropriate care, {delta}D values obtained by conventional procedures (including preheating to {le}200{degrees}C) normally reproduced natural compositions of the smectitic clays with acceptable accuracy and precision.","","","","","","United States","1995-06-01T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: Geochimica et Cosmochimica Acta; Journal Volume: 59; Journal Issue: 12; Other Information: PBD: Jun 1995","","Medium: X; Size: pp. 2545-2559","","","","Journal ID: GCACAK; ISSN 0016-7037; TRN: 95:005939-0004","10.1016/0016-7037(95)00149-2","","2009-12-16T00:00:00Z","107732","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/107732","","Geochimica et Cosmochimica Acta","12","59"
"The origin of hydrothermal and other gases in the Kenya Rift Valley","Darling, W G; Griesshaber, E; Andrews, J N","15 GEOTHERMAL ENERGY; KENYA; GEOTHERMAL RESOURCES; RIFT ZONES; HYDROTHERMAL SYSTEMS; GEOCHEMISTRY; VAPORS; ORIGIN; ROCK-FLUID INTERACTIONS","The Kenya Rift Valley (KRV) is part of a major continental rift system from which much outgassing is presently occurring. Previous research on gases in the KRV has tended to concentrate on their geothermal implications; the present paper is an attempt to broaden the interpretation by consideration of new data including helium and carbon isotope analyses from a wide cross-section of sites. In order to do this, gases have been divided into categories dependent on origin. N{sub 2} and noble gases are for the most part atmospherically derived, although their relative concentrations may be altered from ASW ratios by various physical processes. Reduced carbon (CH{sub 4} and homologues) appears to be exclusively derived from the shallow crust, with thermogenic {delta}{sup 13}C values averaging -25{per_thousand} PDB for CH{sub 4}. H{sub 2} is likely also to be crustally formed. CO{sub 2}, generally a dominant constituent, has a narrow {delta}{sup 13}C range averaging -3.7{per_thousand} PDB, and is likely to be derived with little modification from the upper mantle. Consideration of the ratio C/{sup 3}He supports this view in most cases. Sulphur probably also originates there. Ratios of {sup 3}He/{sup 4}He reach a MORB-like maximum of 8.0 R/R{sub A} and provide the best indication of an upper mantle source of gases beneath the KRV. A correlation between {sup 3}He/{sup 4}He and the hydrocarbon parameter log (C{sub 1}/{Sigma}C{sub 2-4}) appears to be primarily temperature related. The highest {sup 3}He/{sup 4}He ratios in spring waters are associated with basalts, perhaps because of the leaching of basalt glasses. There may be a structural control on {sup 3}He/{sup 4}He ratios in the KRV as a whole.","","","","","","United States","1995-06-01T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: Geochimica et Cosmochimica Acta; Journal Volume: 59; Journal Issue: 12; Other Information: PBD: Jun 1995","","Medium: X; Size: pp. 2501-2512","","","","Journal ID: GCACAK; ISSN 0016-7037; TRN: 95:005939-0003","10.1016/0016-7037(95)00145-X","","2009-12-16T00:00:00Z","107731","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/107731","","Geochimica et Cosmochimica Acta","12","59"
"Mapping the fluid flow of the Mariana Mounds ridge flank hydrothermal system: Pore water chemical tracers","Wheat, C G; McDuff, R E","15 GEOTHERMAL ENERGY; HYDROTHERMAL SYSTEMS; FLUID FLOW; MAPPING; TRACER TECHNIQUES; RIFT ZONES","The authors present a conceptual model of fluid circulation in a ridge flank hydrothermal system, the Mariana Mounds. The model is based on chemical data from pore waters extracted from piston cores and from push cores collected by deep-sea research vessel Alvin in small, meter-sized mounds situated on a local topographic high. These mounds are located within a region of heat flow exceeding that calculated from a conductive model and are zones of strong pore water upflow. The authors have interpreted the chemical data with time-dependent transport-reaction models to estimate pore water velocities. In the mounds themselves pore water velocities reach several meters per year to kilometers per year. Within about 100 m from these zones of focused upflow velocities decrease to several centimeters per year up to tens of centimeters per year. A large area of low heat flow surrounds these heat flow and topographic highs, with upwelling pore water velocities less than 2 cm/yr. In some nearby cores, downwelling of bottom seawater is evident but at speeds less than 2 cm/yr. Downwelling through the sediments appears to be a minor source of seawater recharge to the basaltic basement. The authors conclude that the principal source of seawater recharge to basement is where basement outcrops exist, most likely a scarpt about 2-4 km to the east and southeast of the study area. 71 refs., 14 figs., 3 tabs.","","","","","","United States","1995-05-10T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: Journal of Geophysical Research; Journal Volume: 100; Journal Issue: B5; Other Information: PBD: 10 May 1995","","Medium: X; Size: pp. 8115-8131","","","","Journal ID: JGREA2; ISSN 0148-0227; TRN: 95:006711-0001","10.1029/95JB00047","","2009-12-16T00:00:00Z","136213","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/136213","","Journal of Geophysical Research","B5","100"

The calcite particles were then packed, and the NMR longitudinal relaxation time T{sub 1} of water saturating the interparticle pores was measured. NMR surface relaxivity was then computed as 1/(T{sub 1}{times}S{sub p}/V{sub p}), where S{sub p}/V{sub p} is the ratio of surface area to pore volume. Adsorbed manganese increases the NMR surface relaxivity to approximately 2.4 {times} 10{sup {minus}3} cm/s, roughly 50 times the surface relaxivity of very pure calcite. Flowing water with 4 {mu}M Mn{sup 2+} through a porous limestone plug decreased its T{sub 1} by a factor of 6. Iron as adsorbate produced relatively small increases in surface relaxivity. These results suggest that manganese dominates the surface relaxivity, of limestone rocks in situ, which is important in the interpretation of NMR borehole logs. Observations suggest that some adsorbed manganese eventually becomes buried by freshly precipitated calcite. In particular, the surface relaxivity increased with initial adsorption, but gradually decreased at long reaction times, even as the aqueous manganese concentration continued to decrease. NMR evidently senses only the manganese in the outermost atomic layer, and thus might prove useful in more detailed studies of adsorption.","","","","","","United States","1995-03-15T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: Journal of Colloid and Interface Science; Journal Volume: 170; Journal Issue: 2; Other Information: PBD: 15 Mar 1995","","Medium: X; Size: pp. 502-514","","","","Journal ID: JCISA5; ISSN 0021-9797; TRN: IM9521%%297","10.1006/jcis.1995.1129","","2009-12-16T00:00:00Z","43132","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/43132","","Journal of Colloid and Interface Science","2","170"

The authors present a model which predicts the amplitudes of these Stoneley waves as a function of certain parameters of the fractures, namely, the fracture aperture (width), the orientation, and the degree of stiffness and roughness of the fracture. The proposed mechanism for the generation of these borehole Stoneley waves is coupling of a guided mode, induced in the fracture by an incident plane wave (typically a P wave), to the borehole. The model expresses the borehole Stoneley wave amplitude, normalized by the amplitude of the direct P wave, as a function of frequency, in terms of the fracture parameters. The model is used as the basis for an inversion scheme, employing a nonlinear least squares algorithm to estimate the fracture parameters. The inversion is then applied to VSP data where borehole Stoneley waves are observed at depths where fractures are known to intersect the borehole. The results of the inversion indicate that the aperture and vertical component of the orientation (i.e., dip) of the fracture can be accurately estimated but the horizontal component of the orientation (i.e., strike) is not well resolved. These conclusions are based on comparisons with independent estimates of these parameters from flow tests and borehole televiewer measurements. In addition, stiffness and roughness of the fractures are important effects which must be considered in order to obtain realistic estimates for the other parameters, especially the fracture aperture. 27 refs., 14 figs., 21 tabs.","","","","","","United States","1995-03-10T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: Journal of Geophysical Research; Journal Volume: 100; Journal Issue: B3; Other Information: PBD: 10 Mar 1995","","Medium: X; Size: pp. 4131-4148","","","FG02-86ER13636","Journal ID: JGREA2; ISSN 0148-0227; TRN: 95:005653-0001","10.1029/94JB02982","","2009-12-16T00:00:00Z","181968","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/181968","","Journal of Geophysical Research","B3","100"

Elastic wave velocities are reduced in the presence of open microcracks and fractures and may therefore be used to monitor the progressive damage of the rock. In general, these microcracks are not randomly oriented, and the rock displays an elastic anisotropy. The elastic anisotropy due to cracks can be expressed in terms of a second-rank and fourth-rank crack density tensor. For open cracks the contribution of the fourth-rank crack density tensor to the elastic wave velocities is small. These results are compared with recent measurements of the ultrasonic compressional and shear wave velocities for propagation parallel and perpendicular to an increasing axial stress applied at constant confining stress to Berea sandstone. Inversion of the velocity measurements indicates that the microcracks propagate parallel to the maximum compressive stress, in agreement with current rock mechanics theory. A reasonable fit to the data is obtained using only the second-rank crack density tensor even though, at high confining stress, the cracks are expected to be in partial contact along their length. This is consistent with the model of elastic wave propagation in a medium containing partially contacting fractures published by White.

"Use of silica waste from the Cerro Prieto geothermal field as construction material","Lund, J W; Boyd, T; Monnie, D","15 GEOTHERMAL ENERGY; CERRO PRIETO GEOTHERMAL FIELD; LIQUID WASTES; BY-PRODUCTS; BRINES; PRODUCTION; SILICA; USES; THERMODYNAMIC PROPERTIES; CALIFORNIA; GEOTHERMAL FIELDS; MEXICO; BUILDING MATERIALS; BRICKS","The Cerro Prieto geothermal field generates 620 MW of electric power and in the process produces 11,000 tonnes of brine per hour that is disposed of in surface ponds. Approximately 1300 tonnes of silica waste is the residual product from this hourly production of brine. At present, there is no use for this waste silica. Some experimental work has been undertaken by CFE to utilize this waste silica such as for surfacing roads with a cement-silica mixture and making bricks with various additives. However, none of this research has been documented. Approximately two years ago, a joint USDOE/CFE research project was proposed to investigate the use of the waste silica. The proposal included using the silica mixed with asphalt and cement to produce a suitable road surfacing material, and to combine the silica with various additives to be used as bricks for low cost housing. It was thought, that the low specific gravity of the silica and the proposed mixtures would give the bricks a high insulating value (low-thermal conductivity), thus protecting the residents from high solar heating, typical of Baja California and the area around Mexicali. Finally, since the geothermal fields of the area extend into the Imperial Valley of California where 420 MW of geothermal power is generated, it was hoped that this research would also be applicable to the U.S. side of the border. Some attempt has been made by UNOCAL at their Imperial Valley plant (now owned by Magma Power) to use the waste silica stabilized with cement for roads and dikes around the plant.","","","","","","United States","1995-02-01T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: Geo-Heat Center Quarterly Bulletin; Journal Volume: 16; Journal Issue: 2; Other Information: PBD: Feb 1995","","Medium: X; Size: pp. 15-22","","","","Journal ID: GCQBDW; ISSN 0276-1084; TRN: 95:005251-0004","","","2009-12-16T00:00:00Z","107726","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/107726","","Geo-Heat Center Quarterly Bulletin","2","16"

A column filled with structured packing is used as condenser with the water in counterflow with the steam/CO[sub 2] mixture. The region along the column where the bulk of condensation takes place is controllable by suitable choice of the steam/water ratio. Measured local heat-transfer coefficients change by roughly an order of magnitude from the bottom to the top of the column. The extent of CO[sub 2] dissolution in the water/condensate under most conditions is unexpectedly high and depends strongly on the exit liquid temperature. A driving force based on the interfacial CO[sub 2] concentration, not the overall concentration difference used in conventional absorption operations, is suggested as more appropriate to describe the phenomenon. The data are complemented with preliminary results from a computational model based on the integration along the column of local heat and mass-transfer rates. Direct-contact condensation of steam on water in the presence of noncondensable gases is encountered in various applications such as power-plant condensers, ocean thermal energy conversion systems, and geothermal installations. It is also relevant to the nuclear industry in certain safety evaluation scenarios. The application motivating this study is the separation of noncondensable gases from high pressure geothermal steam upstream of the turbines.","","","","","","United States","1995-02-01T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: AIChE Journal (American Institute of Chemical Engineers); (United States); Journal Volume: 41:2","","Medium: X; Size: Pages: 241-250","","","","Journal ID: ISSN 0001-1541; CODEN: AICEAC","10.1002/aic.690410206","","2016-05-26T00:00:00Z","6501754","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/6501754","","AIChE Journal (American Institute of Chemical Engineers); (United States)","","41:2"

Table 1 summarizes the U.S. geothermal direct heat uses. It should be noted that Table 1 does not contain enhanced oil recovery, which was included in the 1990 update report. In the oil fields of the upper midwest (Montana, North Dakota and Wyoming), thermal waters are not being injected at higher temperatures than the oil producing zones. This means that there is no benefit to reducing oil viscosity, which would have increased production rates; therefore, resulting in this use being deleted from direct uses in the table. In the 1990 report two geothermal district heating systems were listed as under construction, Mammoth Lakes and Bridgeport, these systems have not been built although exploratory wells have been drilled. They are not included in the current summary of direct uses. There have been no new geothermal district heating systems started; however, San Bernardino and Klamath Falls have expanded their systems. Annual energy use of direct heat applications reported for both the 1990 and 1994 updates are shown. All of the categories experienced some increase in use, however the largest growth has been in geothermal heat pumps. From 1985 to 1990 the highest growth rate in geothermal heat pumps occurred, then tapered off some from 1990 to 1994. In the other five categories there has been a steady growth with the largest occurring in space heating, greenhouses and industrial plants. Greenhouse development has been significant in New Mexico and Utah and a new onion and garlic dehydration plant was built in Nevada.","","","","","","United States","1995-02-01T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: Geo-Heat Center Quarterly Bulletin; Journal Volume: 16; Journal Issue: 2; Other Information: PBD: Feb 1995","","Medium: X; Size: pp. 1-6","","","FG07-90ID13040","Journal ID: GCQBDW; ISSN 0276-1084; TRN: 95:005251-0001","","","2009-12-16T00:00:00Z","107723","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/107723","","Geo-Heat Center Quarterly Bulletin","2","16"

Due to a change in traffic routing in 1948, U.S. Highway 97 was routed with a new bridge and roadway through downtown Klamath Falls with an adverse 8 percent grade. Problems with traffic in winter led to the incorporation of a geothermal experiment in de-icing into the Oregon Department of Transportation (ODOT) construction project. The geothermal well was originally artesian, but the static water level has dropped over the years of usage, and the water temperatures at various depths have also dropped. Changes in city environmental regulations in 1985 have called for the elimination of all surface and sewer discharge from geothermal wells. Modifications to the existing pavement de-icing system which would bring it into compliance with the city ordinances are discussed in this paper.","","","","","","United States","1995-02-01T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: Geo-Heat Center Quarterly Bulletin; Journal Volume: 16; Journal Issue: 2; Other Information: PBD: Feb 1995","","Medium: X; Size: pp. 23-28","","","","Journal ID: GCQBDW; ISSN 0276-1084; TRN: 95:005251-0005","","","2009-12-16T00:00:00Z","107727","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/107727","","Geo-Heat Center Quarterly Bulletin","2","16"
"A spreadsheet for geothermal energy cost evaluation","Rafferty, K","15 GEOTHERMAL ENERGY; GEOTHERMAL ENERGY; COST; GEOTHERMAL HEATING SYSTEMS; FINANCIAL DATA; EVALUATION; ECONOMICS","In order to be seriously considered as an alternative in any project, an energy source must be easily characterized in terms of cost, both capital and unit energy cost. Historically, this has been a difficult hurdle for geothermal energy. Its costs vary with the depth and character of the resource, number of production and injection wells, and a host of other parameters. As a result, even in cases where developers are interested in using the geothermal, identifying its costs has been a cumbersome process. To address this problem, the Geo-Heat Center is developing a spreadsheet which will allow potential users to quickly evaluate the capital cost and unit energy cost of accessing a geothermal resource. Using resource, financing and operating inputs, the spreadsheet calculates the capital cost for production well(s), well pump(s), well head equipment, injection well(s), and connecting pipelines. These capital costs are used along with the quantity of annual energy to be supplied and financing information to produce a unit cost of energy. Unit costs for operation (maintenance and electricity) are added to arrive at a total unit cost in $ per million Btu for geothermal heat. To put this value into perspective, similar costs for an equivalently sized gas boiler plant are also calculated. These values can then be compared to determine the relative economic merit of geothermal for any specific set of circumstances. This information is particularly useful at the conceptual stage of a project when decisions as to fuel source are typically made by the developers. Cost data for geothermal systems was drawn primarily from past projects and vendor price data. Costs for well head piping and gas boiler equipment was taken from standard industry estimating guides.","","","","","","United States","1995-02-01T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: Geo-Heat Center Quarterly Bulletin; Journal Volume: 16; Journal Issue: 2; Other Information: PBD: Feb 1995","","Medium: X; Size: pp. 11-14","","","","Journal ID: GCQBDW; ISSN 0276-1084; TRN: 95:005251-0003","","","2009-12-16T00:00:00Z","107725","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/107725","","Geo-Heat Center Quarterly Bulletin","2","16"

Two types of large (up to 4 cm long) noncrystallographic dendrites are important components of these deposits. Feather dendrites are characterized by multiple levels of branching with individual branches developed through crystal splitting and spherulitic growth. Scandulitic (from Latin meaning shingle) dendrites are formed of stacked calcite crystals and are generally more compact than feather dendrites. These developed through the incremental stacking of rectangular-shaped calcite crystals that initially grew as skeletal crystals. Feather and scandulitic dendrites precipitated from the same waters in the same springs. The difference in morphology is therefore related to microenvironments in which they grew. Feather dendrites grew in any direction in pools of free-standing water provided that they were in constant contact with the solute. Conversely, scandulitic dendrites grew on rims of dams where water flowed over the surface in concert with the pulses of spring water. Thus, each calcite crystal in these dendrites represents one episode of crystal growth. The orientation of the component crystals in scandulitic dendrites is controlled by the topography of the dam or surface, not crystallographic criteria. The noncrystallographic dendrites formed from spring waters with initial temperatures of 90--99 C. Surficial water cooling, loss of CO{sub 2}, and presence of other elements that can interfere with crystal growth contributed to the formation of these unusual crystals.","","","","","","United States","1995-01-02T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: Journal of Sedimentary Research, Section A: Sedimentary Petrology and Processes; Journal Volume: 65; Journal Issue: 1; Other Information: PBD: 2 Jan 1995","","Medium: X; Size: pp. 154-169","","","","Journal ID: JSRAEA; ISSN 1073-130X; TRN: IM9519%%38","","","2009-12-16T00:00:00Z","37117","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/37117","","Journal of Sedimentary Research, Section A: Sedimentary Petrology and Processes","1","65"

The heat in the water is derived from the normal heat of the rocks, and the contribution from chemical heating is negligible. Water is pumped from the mines to act as the primary input to heat pumps for heating and cooling industrial buildings. Annual heat exchange with the mine by the largest user puts more heat into the mine in summer than is taken out in winter. Buildings without heavy machinery, such as office buildings, drain little heat from the mine, so that many heat exchange systems could operate indefinitely, without significant depletion of the heat source. Initial costs of heat pump installation are higher than the costs of conventional oil furnaces, but the operating costs are substantially lower. In the Springhill systems, heat pumps provide summer cooling as well as winter heating, and total costs of geothermal heating are substantially lower than heating by fuel oil in eastern Canada. There is a net saving in the emission of carbon dioxide to the atmosphere.","","","","USDOE","","United States","1995-01-01T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: Energy Sources; Journal Volume: 17; Journal Issue: 1; Conference: Annual meeting of the Canadian Society of Coal and Organic Petrology, Calgary (Canada), 21-22 May 1993; Other Information: PBD: Jan-Feb 1995","","Medium: X; Size: pp. 93-106","","CONF-9305402-","","Journal ID: EGYSAO; ISSN 0090-8312; TRN: IM9516%%174","10.1080/00908319508946072","","2016-05-12T00:00:00Z","28048","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/28048","","Energy Sources","1","17"

The long side walls of the cavity are maintained at a uniform heat flux condition, while the short side walls are thermally insulated. On the basis of a parallel flow model, the problem is solved analytically to obtain a set of closed-form solutions. Scale analysis is applied to the case of a boundary layer flow regime in a vertical enclosure. Comparison between the fully numerical and analytical solutions is presented for 0 {<=} Ra {<=} 10{sup 3}, 0 {<=} Ha {<=} 10, and {minus}180 {<=} {phi} {<=} 180{degree}, where Ra, Ha, and {phi} denote the Rayleigh number, Hartmann number, and inclination of the enclosure, respectively. It is found that the analytical solutions can faithfully predict the influence of a magnetic field on the flow structure and heat transfer for a wide range of the governing parameters. For a boundary layer flow regime in a vertical cavity the results of the scale analysis agree well with approximations of the analytical solution. For this situation it is found that the Nusselt number is Nu = 0.5Ra{sup 2/5} / (1 + Ha{sup 2}){sup 2/5}. For a horizontal cavity heated from below the critical Rayleigh number for the onset of motion, determined from a stability analysis, corresponds to that for the existence of unicellular convection using the parallel flow approximation. In general, it is demonstrated that, with the application of an external magnetic field, the temperature and velocity fields are significantly modified and the Nusselt number is decreased with increasing Ha.","","","","USDOE","","United States","1995-01-01T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: Numerical Heat Transfer.

"Fractal geometry characterization of geothermal reservoir fracture networks","Watanabe, K; Takahashi, H","15 GEOTHERMAL ENERGY; FRACTALS; MONTE CARLO METHOD; GEOTHERMAL RESOURCES; COMPUTERIZED SIMULATION; FRACTURED RESERVOIRS; MATHEMATICAL MODELS","As a new procedure for modeling geothermal energy extraction systems, a two-dimensional modeling technique for subsurface fracture networks on the basis of `fractal geometry` is presented. Models of fracture networks are generated by distributing fractures randomly in space and by using the fractal relation between fracture length r and the number of fractures N expressed with a fractal dimension D as N = Cr(exp -D), where C is a constant that signifies the fracture density within the rock mass. This procedure makes it possible to characterize geothermal reservoirs by parameters measured from field data, such as from core sampling. In this characterization the fracture density parameter C of a geothermal reservoir is used as a parameter to model the subsurface fracture network. Using this fracture network model, the connectivities of the water flow paths between wells are calculated by means of a Monte Carlo simulation, and the result is then compared with that derived from a percolation model. We show that many fewer fractures are required to connect two wells for the fracture network model than for the percolation model. The transmissivities between wells for the fracture network model are also obtained as a function of the fracture density parameter C. The results show that the transmissivities in geothermal reservoirs are significantly dependent upon the fracture density of rock mass, and they can be predicted from the fracture density parameter C of the reservoirs.","","","","","","United States","1995-01-01T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: Journal of Geophysical Research; Journal Volume: 100; Journal Issue: B1; Other Information: PBD: Jan 1995","","Medium: X; Size: pp. 521-528","","","","Journal ID: JGREA2; ISSN 0148-0227; TRN: 9574963","10.1029/94JB02167","","2009-12-16T00:00:00Z","57312","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/57312","","Journal of Geophysical Research","B1","100"

No correlation was found between Au and As, Sb, or total Fe in the sinters, although the sample containing the highest Au also contains the highest Sb. There also was no correlation of Au in the sinter with the H{sub 2}S concentration in the discharged hot spring water or with the estimated temperature of last equilibration of the water with the surrounding rock. The Au in rhyolitic tuffs and lavas at YNP found within the Yellowstone caldera show the same range in Au as do those outside the caldera, while thermal waters from within this caldera all have been found to contain relatively low dissolved Au and to deposit sinters that contain relatively little Au. Therefore, it is not likely that variations in Au concentrations among these sinters simply reflect differences in leachable Au in the rocks through which the hydrothermal fluids have passed. Rather, variations in [H{sub 2}S], the concentration of total dissolved sulfide, that result from different physical and chemical processes that occur in different parts of the hydrothermal system appear to exert the main control on the abundance of Au in these sinters. Hydrothermal fluids at YNP convect upward through a series of successively shallower and cooler reservoirs where water-rock chemical and isotopic reactions occur in response to changing temperature and pressure. In some parts of the system the fluids undergo decompressional boiling, and in other parts they cool conductively without boiling. Mixing of ascending water from deep in the system with shallow groundwaters is common. All three processes generally result in a decrease in [H{sub 2}S] and destabilize dissolved gold bisulfide complexes in reservoir waters in the YNP system.","","","","","","United States","1994-12-01T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: Geochimica et Cosmochimica Acta; Journal Volume: 58; Journal Issue: 24; Other Information: PBD: Dec 1994","","Medium: X; Size: pp. 5401-5419","","","AC03-76SF00098","Journal ID: GCACAK; ISSN 0016-7037; TRN: 95:000422-0002","10.1016/0016-7037(94)90238-0","","2009-12-16T00:00:00Z","28811","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/28811","","Geochimica et Cosmochimica Acta","24","58"

However, even if reservoir productivity goals are achieved, the role of heat mining with today`s energy prices and development costs is limited to only a small fraction of the Earth`s surface. A generalized multi-parameter economic model was developed for optimizing the design and performance of hot dry rock (HDR) geothermal systems. Key technical and institutional obstacles to universal heat mining are discussed in a more general context. Advanced concepts in drilling technology are reviewed in light of their potential impact on overcoming some of these obstacles to universal heat mining.","","","","USDOE","","United States","1994-12-01T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: Science and Global Security; Journal Volume: 5; Journal Issue: 1; Other Information: PBD: Dec 1994","","Medium: X; Size: pp. 99-121","","","","Journal ID: SGSEE8; ISSN 0892-9882; TRN: 95:001978-0007","10.1080/08929889408426418","","2016-05-30T00:00:00Z","68051","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/68051","","Science and Global Security","1","5"

The wide variety of equipment, growers preferences and resource temperatures can make the selection a complicated process. As with any project, the cost of the equipment is a primary consideration. To manually evaluate the cost of five or six alternate systems for each project is prohibitive due to the time required. As a result of these issues, the Geo-Heat Center has developed a spreadsheet entitled [open quotes]Greenhouse Heating Equipment Selection[close quotes] (GHS). GHS is a tool for evaluating the cost (both capital and operating) of six types of greenhouse heating systems: unit heaters, finned pipe, bare tube, fan coil, combination bare tube/fan coil and low temperature unit heaters.

Solutions of the problem have been carried out using a finite-difference method through the use of a stream function-vorticity transformation. Various interesting characteristics of the flow and temperature fields in the composite layer are analyzed and discussed in detail. The effects of various governing dimensionless parameters, such as the Darcy number, Reynolds number, Prandtl number, the inertia parameter as well as the effects of pertinent geometric parameters are thoroughly explored.

Oil field scales are formed mainly from the sparingly soluble sulfates and carbonates of calcium, strontium and barium. All the available sale prediction models are based on thermodynamics and, hence, can predict only the potential to form scale. To understand and predict actual scale formation, it is necessary to study and incorporate into scale prediction models, the kinetics and mechanism of precipitation from solution over wide ranges of temperature, pressure, ionic strength and supersaturation. The kinetic data available in the literature cover a reasonably wide range of supersaturation, but are in a narrow range of temperature around 298 K. There are hardly any discussions on the effects of ionic strength and pressure on spontaneous precipitation. In this work, the precipitation of strontium sulfate from supersaturated solutions was studied by monitoring the changes in strontium ion concentration during spontaneous precipitation. This work presents the experimental results on the effects of temperature and ionic strength on the rate constant. Kinetic rate expressions, which may be used in development of models for predicting scale formation, are developed.","","","","","","United States","1994-08-01T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: AIChE Journal (American Institute of Chemical Engineers); (United States); Journal Volume: 40:8","","Medium: X; Size: Pages: 1422-1425","","","","Journal ID: ISSN 0001-1541; CODEN: AICEAC","10.1002/aic.690400815","","2016-05-24T00:00:00Z","6930711","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/6930711","","AIChE Journal (American Institute of Chemical Engineers); (United States)","","40:8"

"Isotope and fluid inclusion studies of geological and hydrothermal processes, northern Peru","MacFarlane, A W; Prol-Ledesma, R M; Conrad, M E","15 GEOTHERMAL ENERGY; 58 GEOSCIENCES; PERU; HYDROTHERMAL SYSTEMS; MINERAL RESOURCES; ROCK-FLUID INTERACTIONS; GEOCHEMISTRY; INCLUSIONS; CHEMICAL COMPOSITION","Mineralization in the Hualgayoc district of northern Peru occurs in altered Miocene felsic intrusions and in mid-Cretaceous platform sedimentary rocks of the Goyllarisquizga, Inca, and Chulec formations. The ores occur both as stratiform and stratabound pyritiferous base-metal deposits (mantos), and as steeply dipping, sedimentary and intrusive rock-hosted base-metal veins. Igneous rocks in the district are affected by propylytic, sericitic-argillic, sericitic, potassic, and acid-sulfate alteration. K-Ar and Rb-Sr dating and geological evidence indicate multiple stages of intrusive activity and hydrothermal alteration, including close spatial emplacement of two or more separate Miocene magmatic-hydrothermal systems. K-Ar dates on sericite, hydrothermal biotite, and alunite indicate that the most important hydrothermal episodes in the district took place {approx}13.24 and 12.4 Ma. Other K-Ar dates on altered rocks in the district may reflect various amounts of resetting by the emplacement of the 9.05 {+-} 0.2 Ma Hualgayoc rhyodacite. A five-point Rb-Sr isochron for the San Miguel intrusion at Cerro Coymolache yields an age of 45 {+-} 3.4 Ma, which indicates much earlier magmatic activity in this area than recognized previously. Fluid inclusion and paragenetic studies reveal a clear temporal evolution of fluid temperature and chemistry in the San Agustin area at Hualgayoc. Gradually, ore formation shifted to precipitation of vein minerals in the brittle fractures as the mantos became less permeable and were sealed off. Vein formation continued from progressively cooler and more diluted fluids (down to {approx}150{degrees}C and 4.3 wt% NaCl equivalent) as the system waned. No evidence for phase separation is observed in the fluids until the very last paragenetic stage, which contributed no economic mineralization. 53 refs., 15 figs., 7 tabs.","","","","USDOE","","United States","1994-07-01T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: International Geology Review; Journal Volume: 36; Journal Issue: 7; Other Information: PBD: Jul 1994","","Medium: X; Size: pp. 645-677","","","AC03-76SF00098","Journal ID: IGREAP; ISSN 0020-6814; CNN: Grant EAR-8614877;Grant IN101992; TRN: 95:004481-0001","10.1080/00206819409465480","","2016-05-27T00:00:00Z","456727","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/456727","","International Geology Review","7","36"

Within a narrow pH range, close to the pH value where spontaneous bulk precipitation occurs, thin coherent layers develop, which are well attached to the steel substrate. Initial deposition rate data combined with CdS sol characterization, using light absorbance measurements and scanning electron microscopy, suggest that the prevailing mechanism is crystallization right on the tubular surface. More specifically, the influence of velocity on initial deposition rate as well as the level of estimated activation energy for wall crystallization points to a mass-transfer-controlled process. By studying the morphology of deposits as a function of solution properties (pH, concentration, temperature), flow velocity, and time, conditions are identified for creating (or avoiding the formation of) coherent CdS layers.","","","","","","United States","1994-07-01T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: Journal of Colloid and Interface Science; (United States); Journal Volume: 165:2","","Medium: X; Size: Pages: 301-309","","","","Journal ID: ISSN 0021-9797; CODEN: JCISA5","10.1006/jcis.1994.1233","","2016-05-20T00:00:00Z","7267856","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/7267856","","Journal of Colloid and Interface Science; (United States)","","165:2"

The purpose of the 1992-1993 low-temperature geothermal resource assessment is to update the earlier physical, geochemical, and utilization data and compile computerized databases of the location, chemistry, and general information of the low-temperature geothermal resources in Colorado. The main sources of the data included published data from the Colorado Geological Survey, the U.S. Geological Survey WATSTOR database, and the files of the State Division of Water Resources. The staff of the Colorado Geological Survey in 1992 and 1993 visited most of the known geothermal sources that were recorded as having temperatures greater than 30{degrees}C. Physical measurements of the conductivity, pH, temperature, flow rate, and notes on the current geothermal source utilization were taken. Ten new geochemical analyses were completed on selected geothermal sites. The results of the compilation and field investigations are compiled into databases. For the purpose of this report, a geothermal area is defined as a broad area, usually less than three square miles in size, that may have several wells or springs. A geothermal site is an individual well or spring within a geothermal area. The 1992-1993 assessment reports that there are 93 geothermal areas in Colorado, up from the 56 reported in 1978; there are 157 geothermal sites up from 125 reported in 1978; and a total of 382 geochemical analyses are compiled, up from the 236 reported in 1978. Six geothermal areas are recommended for further investigation: Trimble Hot Springs, Orvis Hot Springs, an area southeast of Pagosa Springs, the eastern San Luis Valley, Rico and Duntton area, and Cottonwood Hot Springs.","","","","","","United States","1994-07-01T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: Geo-Heat Center Quarterly Bulletin; Journal Volume: 15; Journal Issue: 4; Other Information: PBD: Jul 1994","","Medium: X; Size: pp. 9-14","","","","Journal ID: GCQBDW; ISSN 0276-1084; TRN: 95:003101-0002","","","2009-12-16T00:00:00Z","75377","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/75377","","Geo-Heat Center Quarterly Bulletin","4","15"

The discharge zone of the hydrothermal system is revealed along scarps, thus providing an opportunity to examine the uppermost mineralized, and highly altered interior parts of the crust. Altered rocks collected in situ by the submersible ALVIN show complex concentric alteration zones. Microsamples of individual zones have been analysed for major/minor, trace elements, and strontium isotopes in order to describe the complex compositional details of the hydrothermal alteration. Interlayered chlorite-smectite and chlorite with disequilibrium compositions dominate the secondary mineralogy as replacement phases of primary glass and acicular pyroxene. Phenocrysts and matrix grains of plagioclase are unaffected during alteration. Using a modification of the Gresens` equation we demonstrate that the trivalent rare earth elements (REEs) are relatively immobile, and calculate degrees of enrichment and depletion in other elements. Strontium isotopic ratios increase as Sr concentrations decrease from least-altered cores to most-altered rims and cross-cutting veins in individual samples, and can be modeled by open system behaviour under low fluid-rock ratio (<10) conditions following a period of lower-temperature weathering of volcanics within the rift zone. The complex patterns of element enrichment and depletion and strontium isotope variations indicate mixing between pristine seawater and ascending hot fluids to produce a compositional spectrum of fluids. If, as suggested here, the discharge zone alteration occurred under relatively low fluid-rock ratios, then this shallow region must play an important role in determining the exit composition of vent fluids in marine hydrothermal systems. 50 refs., 10 figs., 4 tabs.","","","","","","United States","1994-06-01T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: Geochimica et Cosmochimica Acta; Journal Volume: 58; Journal Issue: 11; Other Information: PBD: Jun 1994","","Medium: X; Size: pp. 2477-2494","","","","Journal ID: GCACAK; ISSN 0016-7037; TRN: 96:006004-0003","10.1016/0016-7037(94)90025-6","","2009-12-16T00:00:00Z","482169","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/482169","","Geochimica et Cosmochimica Acta","11","58"

Boiling-point elevation is taken into account in these calculations. Preliminary application to some wells in the Larderello geothermal field indicate that: (1) the high concentration of HCl in the steam causes both the low pH and very high TDS of the first drop; (2) the lower the dew-point temperature, the higher the TDS of the first drop; (3) for a given chemical composition, the lower the steam pressure, the higher the risk of corrosion and scaling in the steam path.","","","","","","United States","1994-06-01T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: Geothermics (International Journal of Geothermal Research and its Applications); (United Kingdom); Journal Volume: 23:3","","Medium: X; Size: Pages: 233-255","","","","Journal ID: ISSN 0375-6505; CODEN: GTMCAT","10.1016/0375-6505(94)90002-7","","2016-04-11T00:00:00Z","6964978","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/6964978","","Geothermics (International Journal of Geothermal Research and its Applications); (United Kingdom)","","23:3"

Second shallower reservoir is assumed to exist, with a temperature of the order of 200--220 C. The deep reservoir is shown to be liquid-dominated, while water and steam occupy the shallow one. The piezometric level (elevation 150 m) regulates the areal distribution of water springs and fumaroles.

The MT survey, comprising 18 soundings, was carried out in the bandwidth 128 Hz-40 s, in order to determine the deep conductivity structure in the geothermally prospective western part of the island, Rigorous dimensionality analysis has indicated that the geoelectric structure could adequately be approximated with 1-D interpretation tools. Two significant and seemingly communicating conductive zones of potential geothermal interest were found within the first 2 km. The first is extensive and shallow, detected at depths of 400--600 m; the second is deeper (1,000--1,300 m), but of considerably smaller lateral dimensions. A very deep relative conductor (< 25 [Omega]m) was also detected at depths of 7--10 km, which is thought to comprise part of an old magma chamber with brine-saturated rocks. The microseismicity studies revealed the partial or total attenuation of shear waves in many microearthquake records. The analysis of these observations determined the vertical and lateral extent of that attenuation zone, the greatest part of which is located underneath the marine area between western Kos and Nissyros island to the south, extending approximately from near the surface to about 1.5 km depth. The nature of this zone is discussed in terms of fluid concentration due to the geothermal system of the area.","","","","","","United States","1994-06-01T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: Geothermics (International Journal of Geothermal Research and its Applications); (United Kingdom); Journal Volume: 23:3","","Medium: X; Size: Pages: 267-281","","","","Journal ID: ISSN 0375-6505; CODEN: GTMCAT","10.1016/0375-6505(94)90004-3","","2016-04-25T00:00:00Z","6965010","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/6965010","","Geothermics (International Journal of Geothermal Research and its Applications); (United Kingdom)","","23:3"

"Self-propping and fluid flow in slightly offset joints at high effective pressures","Durham, W B; Bonner, B P; ","15 GEOTHERMAL ENERGY; GRANITES; HYDRAULICS; FLUID FLOW; FRACTURED RESERVOIRS; GEOLOGIC FRACTURES; JOINING; VERY HIGH PRESSURE","The authors have made laboratory measurements of joint closure and permeability of both well- and poorly mated, laboratory-produced joints in Westerly granite under joint normal stresses to 160 MPa, appropriate to midcrustal depths. They have also made detailed topographic measurements of the joint surfaces, both before and after pressure testing. The purpose of the study was to characterize and understand the hydraulic behavior of joints under conditions where fluid migration under natural settings is known to occur but where physical conditions, namely high lithostatic load, suggest that the presence of open, fluid-conducting joints might be improbable. Normal stress was applied by hydrostatic confinement of cylindrical samples, each containing a single axial tensile fracture. Experiments were performed at room temperature under conditions designed to minimize chemical effects of dissolution or precipitation. The authors found that while a mated joint can be completely closed by the application of high normal stresses, the same joint laterally offset by 0.53 mm remains open and many orders of magnitude more hydraulically conductive than the mated joint even at highest stresses. Detailed topographic observations are consistent with self-propping of the offset joint. Permanent damage to the surfaces of the offset joint is not widespread but occurs at isolated locales covering about 10% of the surface. Damage is confined to regions of negative (convex upward) curvature, such as summits and the edges of plateaus. Approximately 20% of the joint surface is in wall-to-wall contact at 160 MPa, and the flow tortuosity thus induced is probably the cause of the breakdown of the parallel plate approximation for fluid flow in the offset joint. 38 refs., 7 figs., 1 tab.","","","","","","United States","1994-05-10T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: Journal of Geophysical Research; Journal Volume: 99; Journal Issue: B5; Other Information: PBD: 10 May 1994","","Medium: X; Size: pp. 9391-9399","","","","Journal ID: JGREA2; ISSN 0148-0227; TRN: 95:005672-0002","10.1029/94JB00242","","2009-12-16T00:00:00Z","135828","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/135828","","Journal of Geophysical Research","B5","99"
"Combined chemical and physical model for plutonic devolatilization: A non-Rayleigh fractionation algorithm","Candela, P A","15 GEOTHERMAL ENERGY; DEVOLATILIZATION; MATHEMATICAL MODELS; MAGMA; GEOTHERMAL ENERGY; ENERGY; ENERGY SOURCES; RENEWABLE ENERGY SOURCES; 152000* - Geothermal Data & Theory","Modeling of magmatic-hydrothermal processes requires the estimation of intensive parameters, the experimental determination of partition coefficients and other equilibria, and quantitative models of processes such as magmatic crystallization and devolatilization. In this paper, a new chemical model for magmatic devolatilization, based on a physical model for volatile release during second boiling, is presented. Models are presented for stable isotopes and nonchloride complexed elements. The release of volatiles during isobaric, plutonic crystallization (second boiling) has been modeled as either a batch (closed-system) or Rayleigh-fractional (open-system) process. However, when the chemical mass transfer, attendant to second boiling, is modeled in conjunction with a simple physical model involving critical percolation of the magmatic volatile phase, the mass transfer can be shown to occur as a transitional batch-fractionation process. Early devolatilization during second boiling follows a batch law as discrete bubbles grow. Depending on the depth (pressure) of intrusion, and the initial volatile content of the magma, the discrete volumes of the volatile phase will achieve a spanning cluster of volumes at some stage in devolatilization progress. When connectivity of volatile phase volumes is established, devolatilization will follow a modified fractionation law wherein a finite, rather than infinitesimal volume of the fractionating phase is in equilibrium with the melt. For devolatilization of melts of a given initial volatile concentration, increasing depth leads to later formation of a spanning cluster and increasing batch character. Extreme depletions of magmatic chlorine or deuterium, or enrichments of magmatic molybdenum or fluorine are made more probable by early establishment of spanning clusters of volatile volumes.","","","","","","United States","1994-05-01T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: Geochimica et Cosmochimica Acta; (United States); Journal Volume: 58:10","","Medium: X; Size: Pages: 2157-2167","","","FG07-90ID13025","Journal ID: ISSN 0016-7037; CODEN: GCACAK; CNN: EAR-9018870; EAR-9204671","10.1016/0016-7037(94)90002-7","","2016-04-25T00:00:00Z","6777789","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/6777789","","Geochimica et Cosmochimica Acta; (United States)","","58:10"

A key resource management issue at this field is the distribution of fluid in the matrix of the reservoir rock. In this paper, the authors interpret seismic compressional-wave velocity and quality quotient (Q) data at The Geysers in terms of the geologic structure and fluid saturation in the reservoir. Their data consist of waveforms from approximately 300 earthquakes. Using compressional-wave arrival times, they invert for earthquake location, origin time, and velocity within a three-dimensional grid. Using the pulse width of the compressional wave, they invert for the pulse width contribution associated with the source and the one-dimensional Q structure. They find that the velocity structure correlates with known mapped geologic units. The dry steam reservoir, which is known from steam well drilling, is mostly correlated with low velocity. The correlation is best for those areas where the steam pressure has been reduced by production. The Q increases with depth to the top of the dry steam reservoir and decreases with depth within the reservoir. This decrease of Q with depth suggests that the liquid saturation of the reservoir rock matrix increases with depth.","","","","","","United States","1994-04-01T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: Geothermics (International Journal of Geothermal Research and its Applications); (United Kingdom); Journal Volume: 23:2","","Medium: X; Size: Pages: 111-126","","","","Journal ID: ISSN 0375-6505; CODEN: GTMCAT","10.1016/0375-6505(94)90033-7","","2016-05-20T00:00:00Z","6841976","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/6841976","","Geothermics (International Journal of Geothermal Research and its Applications); (United Kingdom)","","23:2"

The reservoir linked an injection well (RH12) with a production well (RH15). The initial production temperature (at the casing shoe) was 80 C. The average injection temperature during the early part of the circulation test was about 25 C. Ten per cent thermal drawdown occurred after about 300 days circulation at an average production flow rate of 8.5 kg/s. The mass of fluid produced in this time was 220 million kg. A comprehensive program of reservoir characterization was undertaken to measure as many as possible of the fundamental reservoir parameters was undertaken to measure as may as possible of the fundamental reservoir parameters that are considered to have given rise to the observed thermal and hydraulic performance. This paper reports the main results of this reservoir characterization program. It is concluded that many of the parameters measured are not true estimates of the actual parameters being sought, but apparent parameters, whose values are highly dependent upon the simplifying assumptions used to obtain them. The performance of the RH12/RH15 reservoir is compared with that which would be required of an individual cell of a commercial-scale HDR reservoir consisting of many stimulated cells in parallel. By these criteria, the performance of the RH12/RH15 reservoir falls short in terms of thermal output and water loss, but meets the required impedance. The performance of the RH12/RH15 reservoir was severely limited by the unfavorable trajectory well (RH12), especially in terms of thermal output.","","","","","","United States","1994-04-01T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: Geothermics (International Journal of Geothermal Research and its Applications); (United Kingdom); Journal Volume: 23:2","","Medium: X; Size: Pages: 73-109","","","","Journal ID: ISSN 0375-6505; CODEN: GTMCAT","10.1016/0375-6505(94)90032-9","","2016-04-18T00:00:00Z","6928822","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/6928822","","Geothermics (International Journal of Geothermal Research and its Applications); (United Kingdom)","","23:2"

The installed capacity is nearly 6300 MW-electric. Four developing countries (El Salvador 18%, Kenya 11%, Nicaragua 18% and Philippines 21%) produce over 10% of their total electricity from geothermal. Electric generation cost is commonly around 4 US cents/kWh. Direct utilization of geothermal water is known in about 40 countries, thereof 14 countries have each an installed capacity of over 100 MW-thermal. A worldwide survey shows that the total investments in geothermal energy between 1973 and 1992 amounted to approximately 22 billion US$. During the two decades, 30 countries invested each over 20 million US$, 12 countries over 200 million US$, and 5 countries over 1 billion US$. During the first decade, 1973--1982, public funding amounted to 4.6 billion US$ and private funding to 3 billion US$. During the second decade, 1983--1992, public funding amounted to 6.6 billion US$ and private funding to 7.7 billion US$. The relative economic viability of geothermal energy will improve significantly if and when a pollution tax is endorsed on power production using fossil fuels. Geothermal exploration and exploitation requires skills from many scientific and engineering disciplines. International geothermal training centers are operated in Iceland, Italy, Japan, Mexico, and New Zealand.

To date, little has been published about the connectivity of this area to the rest of the geothermal field, the interaction between the so-called ''typical'' reservoir and the underlying high-temperature zone, or the combined potential of both producing horizons. To investigate these issues, a dual-porosity numerical model of The Geysers geothermal system with special emphasis to the NW Geysers was developed. The model was calibrated using production data from 1957 to early 1991. Simulation results and the measured data suggest that: the typical reservoir in NW Geysers is connected to the rest of the field; significant migration of fluids from this part of the reservoir to the rest of The Geysers has occurred; and there still are some undeveloped areas in the NW Geysers with production potential. The production/injection scenarios analyzed with the model suggest that the existing wells are not sufficient to sustain a 60 MWe operations for 30 years starting in 1991. However, the addition of new wells within the licensed boundaries of the Coldwater Creek steamfield, drilled over a period of years, could sustain the steam production required to generate 60 MWe for 30 years. A 130 MWe development is not feasible within the mid-1993 licensed boundaries.","","","","","","United States","1994-04-01T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: Geothermics (International Journal of Geothermal Research and its Applications); (United Kingdom); Journal Volume: 23:2; Journal Issue: 2","","Medium: X; Size: Pages: 127-141","","","","Journal ID: ISSN 0375-6505; CODEN: GTMCAT","10.1016/0375-6505(94)90034-5","","2016-04-27T00:00:00Z","7085342","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/7085342","","Geothermics (International Journal of Geothermal Research and its Applications); (United Kingdom)","2","23:2"

The dissolution rates are studied in NaCl, Na[sub 2]SO[sub 4], and CaCl[sub 2] solutions and in a stabilized natural water using an automated titrimetric method. The dissolution results are analyzed using an electrical double layer model containing options to account for cation complexation of the silica surface and ion-pair formation in the bulk solution. Simplified expressions are given for the surface potential calculated for 1:1, 2:1, and 1:2 electrolytes which are used to determine the activities of the ions in the surface plane. The results demonstrate similar effects of NaCl and Na[sub 2]SO[sub 4] salts on the dissolution rates with a greater than twofold increase over the range of ionic strength studied. In contrast, the results from the dissolution of silica in CaCl[sub 2] solutions show no influence at calcium concentrations between ca. 2 and 70 mM, but the dissolution rate increases at high calcium concentrations. The dissolution rate in the natural water is similar to that found in CaCl[sub 2] solutions containing the same calcium concentration. The results support the conclusion that the complexation of Na[sup +] with the surface of silica is not an important influence on the dissolution reaction, whereas it is necessary to invoke the surface complexation of Ca[sup 2+] to explain the observed increase of the dissolution rate at higher calcium concentrations. The optimum parameters for the hydrolysis of the ionized and cation-complexed silica are given together with the calculated values of the surface density of the terminal groups. CaCl[sub 2] is shown to enhance the dissolution rate for ionic strengths of <0.1 M relative to NaCl and Na[sub 2]SO[sub 4].","","","","","","United States","1994-03-15T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: Journal of Colloid and Interface Science; (United States); Journal Volume: 163:2","","Medium: X; Size: Pages: 379-390","","","","Journal ID: ISSN 0021-9797; CODEN: JCISA5","10.1006/jcis.1994.1117","","2016-05-23T00:00:00Z","7207790","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/7207790","","Journal of Colloid and Interface Science; (United States)","","163:2"

In this paper, the authors first designed and constructed a greenhouse cooling facility using geothermal water for the driving energy, and then conducted a cooling performance test and growth experiment in the growing of vegetables. As a result of the investigation, first, the facility showed the cooling performance as designed, since the air in the greenhouse was cooled to the desired temperature of 15 C. Second, in the open division, almost all the spinach, lettuce, and Kinusaya peas died back during growing and there was therefore no yield. However, in the cooling division, all the vegetables grew normally and their yields were large. From the results mentioned above, the authors concluded that it is possible to grow vegetables during the high-temperature summer season in greenhouse cooled only at night.","","","","","","United States","1994-03-01T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: Heat Transfer - Japanese Research; (United States); Journal Volume: 22:4","","Medium: X; Size: Pages: 340-354","","","","Journal ID: ISSN 0096-0802; CODEN: HTJPAU","","","2009-12-16T00:00:00Z","5077435","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/5077435","","Heat Transfer - Japanese Research; (United States)","","22:4"

Indigenous sources of energy like the heat content of the subsurface are especially in focus, also due to environmental concern (greenhouse effect due to CO{sub 2} emissions). The most popular and technically advanced space heating system to use ground heat is the borehole heat exchanger (BHE). Shallow, coaxial or U-shaped BHEs are installed in 30-50 m deep, backfilled boreholes to extract, by closed-fluid circulation, heat from the ground. They feed the cold (evaporator) (e.g. floor panel) system to heat usually a single dwelling house. The energy supply for the heat exchanger comes from several sources: the vertical geothermal flux itself, the import of energy horizontally by conduction, advective transport with groundwater if present, and the compensating effect of heat exchange between the ground surface and the atmosphere. Multiple BHEs are installed for larger units like community buildings, etc. Since 1980, almost 5,000 such systems, using about 10,000 BHEs with a total length of more than 700,000 m have been installed in Switzerland. The BHE can be upscaled in order to be installed in otherwise abandoned deep boreholes (e.g., in {open_quotes}dry{close_quotes} geothermal or hydrocarbon exploratory holes). Experimental as well as theoretical studies have been pursued in Switzerland in the last 10 years to establish a sound technical and energy economics base for shallow and deep BHE systems.","","","","","","United States","1994-03-01T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: Geo-Heat Center Quarterly Bulletin; Journal Volume: 15; Journal Issue: 3; Other Information: PBD: Mar 1994","","Medium: X; Size: pp. 12-15","","","","Journal ID: GCQBDW; ISSN 0276-1084; TRN: 95:007974-0004","","","2009-12-16T00:00:00Z","150525","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/150525","","Geo-Heat Center Quarterly Bulletin","3","15"

It`s purpose is to introduce the issues involved and outline the direction the research will take. In an upcoming research task, the Geo-Heat Center will be comparing some cost and performance aspects of different ground-source (geothermal) heat pump systems for commercial applications. Over a range of system sizes (50 to 500 tons), the work will examine capital cost and pumping energy requirements of the ground source portion of ground-coupled and groundwater systems. Due to the different factors influencing the cost of these two approaches, it is likely that for a given project one design will be substantially less costly than the other.","","","","","","United States","1994-03-01T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: Geo-Heat Center Quarterly Bulletin; Journal Volume: 15; Journal Issue: 3; Other Information: PBD: Mar 1994","","Medium: X; Size: pp. 9-11","","","","Journal ID: GCQBDW; ISSN 0276-1084; TRN: 95:007974-0003","","","2009-12-16T00:00:00Z","150524","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/150524","","Geo-Heat Center Quarterly Bulletin","3","15"

Induction periods for the nucleation of calcium sulfate dihydrate were experimentally determined as a function of supersaturation in NaCl solutions from 0 to 6 m at 25 C and in 3.0-m NaCl solutions at temperatures from 25 to 90 C. Using classic nucleation theory, the interfacial tension between gypsum and 3.0-m NaCl solution was estimated to be about 39 mJ/m[sup 2] at 25 C and increases with increasing temperature (to 63 mJ/m[sup 2] at 90 C). It was observed that the induction period decreases with increasing NaCl concentrations up to 3 m and then starts to increase slightly at a given temperature and saturation state. The electrolyte effect on nucleation was proportional to the enhanced solubility of calcium sulfate dihydrate in NaCl solutions. This phenomenon may result from decreased crystal-solution interfacial tensions caused by increased gypsum solubility in electrolyte solutions. Although anhydrite is the thermodynamically stable phase at elevated temperatures and in concentrated solutions, only gypsum was nucleated.","","","","","","United States","1994-02-01T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: Journal of Colloid and Interface Science; (United States); Journal Volume: 162:2","","Medium: X; Size: Pages: 297-303","","","","Journal ID: ISSN 0021-9797; CODEN: JCISA5","10.1006/jcis.1994.1042","","2016-04-08T00:00:00Z","7206183","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/7206183","","Journal of Colloid and Interface Science; (United States)","","162:2"

Analysis of these tracer elements help determine (1) if gases extracted by bulk inclusion analysis can provide accurate measurement of N[sub 2]-Ar-He in active and fossil geothermal systems, (2) if hydrothermal fluids associated with paleogeothermal systems in a continental setting follow N[sub 2]-Ar-He systematics similar to those in the western Pacific Rim active geothermal systems, specifically New Zealand, and (3) whether different deposit types systematically vary with regard to N[sub 2]-Ar-He. The N[sub 2]-Ar-He ratios of fluid inclusion volatiles released from recently deposited minerals from the Valles system are similar to those of present day Valles thermal waters. Those inclusion samples from deep within the Valles system, below a regional aquitard, increase in N[sub 2]. Compositions for inclusions from the Questa and Copper Flat-porphyry deposits are N[sub 2]-rich, similar to those of arc-related volcanic gases, whereas those from Taylor Creek Sn deposit appear to be mixtures of magmatic and crustal components. N[sub 2]-Ar-He ratios of the Precambrian Tribag deposit suggest a basalt source, but significant levels of self-generated He from U and Th in the inclusion fluids are also possible. Inclusions from two epithermal deposits with low-salinity inclusions have N[sub 2]-Ar-He ratios trending towards air-saturated meteoric waters (ASW), and those inclusions with higher salinities indicate minor to no ASW component. The N[sub 2]-Ar-He ratios in Fresnillo and Cochiti inclusions, which have magmatic helium isotopic ratios, indicate additions of magmatic gases to meteoric fluids. Inclusions from sediment-hosted deposits that contain hydrocarbon-bearing brines are He-rich, as are meteoric waters with a long residence time in the crust.","","","","","","United States","1994-02-01T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: Geochimica et Cosmochimica Acta; (United States); Journal Volume: 58:3","","Medium: X; Size: Pages: 1119-1131","","","","Journal ID: ISSN 0016-7037; CODEN: GCACAK; CNN: G1194135; EAR8419081","10.1016/0016-7037(94)90576-2","","2016-05-23T00:00:00Z","7198660","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/7198660","","Geochimica et Cosmochimica Acta; (United States)","","58:3"

Previous interpretations suggested the isotopic composition of the two systems was mainly the result of reactions at high temperature between deeply circulating meteoric water and largely sedimentary host rocks. The authors interpret the data for the Larderello and The Geysers fluids as indicating that meteoric water, exchanged with host rocks, mixes with local magnetic water. The isotopic composition of end-member magmatic water at The Geysers is typical of convergent plate boundaries ([delta][sup 18]O = +5 to +11 per mil; [delta]D = [minus]10 to [minus]35 per mil); a local isotopic composition of +11 to +15 per mil [delta][sup 18]O and [minus]15 to [minus]35 per mil [delta]D is suggested for the Larderello magmatic water. The magmatic water derived from the crystallization of underlying magma. Metamorphic waters, derived from dehydration reactions of OH-bearing minerals, may also make a minor contribution to the geothermal fluids.","","","","","","United States","1994-02-01T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: Geothermics (International Journal of Geothermal Research and its Applications); (United States); Journal Volume: 23:1","","Medium: X; Size: Pages: 21-32","","","","Journal ID: ISSN 0375-6505; CODEN: GTMCAT","10.1016/0375-6505(94)90043-4","","2016-05-23T00:00:00Z","7115455","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/7115455","","Geothermics (International Journal of Geothermal Research and its Applications); (United States)","","23:1"

The model has been implemented in the two-phase flow simulator, HORF, which has been developed in order to predict pressure losses relative to pipeline flow of geothermal brines.

A two-dimensional porous-slab model was used with a non-uniform heat flux boundary conditions at the bottom. Steady-state solutions are obtained for the phase distribution and heat transfer behavior for cases with different mass of fluid (gas saturation) in place, permeabilities, and capillary pressures. The results obtained show very efficient heat transfer in the vapor-dominated zone due to the development of heat pipes and near-uniform saturations. The phase distribution below the vapor-dominated zone depends on permeability. For relatively high-permeability systems, single-phase liquid zones prevail, with convection providing the energy throughput. For lower permeability systems, a two-phase liquid-dominated zone develops, because single-phase liquid convection is not sufficient to dissipate heat released from the source. These results are consistent with observations from the field, where most high-temperature liquid-dominated two-phase systems have relatively low permeabilities e.g. Krafla, Iceland; Kenya; Baca, New Mexico. The numerical results obtained also show that for high heat flow a high-temperature single-phase vapor zone can develop below a typical (240 C) vapor-dominated zone, as has recently been found at the Geysers, California, and Larderello, Italy.","","","","","","United States","1994-02-01T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: Geothermics (International Journal of Geothermal Research and its Applications); (United States); Journal Volume: 23:1","","Medium: X; Size: Pages: 3-20","","","AC03-76SF00098","Journal ID: ISSN 0375-6505; CODEN: GTMCAT","10.1016/0375-6505(94)90042-6","","2016-05-16T00:00:00Z","7304850","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/7304850","","Geothermics (International Journal of Geothermal Research and its Applications); (United States)","","23:1"

The unit costs of heat produced from these schemes are compared with conventional fossil fuel-fired sources in three competitive contexts. In today's fuel markets, in Europe, only the highest temperature geothermal resources are economically viable in all competitive contexts. Lower temperature resources are only viable in more restrictive contexts.

Those experiments have been carried out in both pure H[sub 2]O and solutions containing Na or Pb at various ionic strengths and pH. The measured rates were found to increase significantly with the addition of either Na or Pb. In an attempt to determine the mechanism of these effects, the degree of adsorption of Na and Pb were measured on amorphous silica at 25 and 150[degrees]C. At 25[degrees]C, Na is found to adsorb on the quartz surface as an outer-sphere complex, and the corresponding dissolution rate increase is explained by an increase of the ionic strength. By contrast, at 25[degrees], lead, which forms inner-sphere complexes, increases the quartz dissolution rate specifically. At high temperature, quartz dissolution is promoted in the presence of both Na and Pb by a pH-dependent formation of surface inner-sphere complexes. This effect tends to vanish when the degree of saturation of the solution increases, as a result of the competition between electrolyte and aqueous silica adsorption on quartz surface. These results show that the electrolytes which adsorb as inner-sphere complexes dominate the overall reaction at conditions far from equilibrium only. Consequently, for a large range of chemical affinity quartz dissolution in Na and Pb electrolyte solutions can be modeled within the framework of the Transition State Theory by simply taking into account the protonated surface species and the ionic strength of the solution.","","","","","","United States","1994-01-01T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: Geochimica et Cosmochimica Acta; (United States); Journal Volume: 58:2","","Medium: X; Size: Pages: 541-551","","","","Journal ID: ISSN 0016-7037; CODEN: GCACAK","10.1016/0016-7037(94)90487-1","","2016-04-22T00:00:00Z","5237268","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/5237268","","Geochimica et Cosmochimica Acta; (United States)","","58:2"

Transport models dealing with stable isotopes are well established in recent geochemical literature. The authors extend previous treatments by presenting the derivation of both analytical and numerical solutions to the transport equations incorporating simultaneously advection, diffusion and hydrodynamic dispersion, and kinetics of isotopic exchange. The increased generality of numerical solutions allows the incorporation of other effects which control the spatial patterns of [delta][sup 18]O values developed in rocks and fluids including multiple reactive species and temperature gradients. The authors discuss the effects of flow parameters, conditions of isotopic exchange, and temperature gradients on the spatial patterns of isotopic shifts produced in rock sequences subjected to fluid flow, and on conventionally calculated W/R ratios for these rock sequences. Finally, the authors examine the implications of oxygen isotope transport for two natural systems where isotopic shifts or gradients could be interpreted in terms of unidirectional fluid infiltration. Solutions of one-dimensional transport equations including the mechanisms of advection, diffusion, hydrodynamic dispersion, and non-equilibrium exchange between water and rock indicate that the time-space evolution of oxygen isotopic compositions of rock and infiltrating fluid is dependent on (1) the rate of fluid infiltration, (2) the diffusive and dispersive properties of the rock matrix, (3) the rate of isotopic exchange, and (4) the rock-water mass oxygen ratio in a unit volume of water-saturated, porous rock. 56 refs., 18 figs., 2 tabs.","","","","","","United States","1994-01-01T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: American Journal of Science; (United States); Journal Volume: 294:1","","Medium: X; Size: Pages: 1-55","","","","Journal ID: ISSN 0002-9599; CODEN: AJSCAP; CNN: EAR 8904948; EAR 9205085","10.2475/ajs.294.1.1","","2016-05-13T00:00:00Z","6924604","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/6924604","","American Journal of Science; (United States)","","294:1"

Induced microearthquakes were observed using four borehole seismometers. The P-wave and S-wave arrival times have been inverted to find the 3-D velocity structures and the microearthquake locations and origin times. The inversion was implemented using the separation of parameters technique, and constraints were incorporated to require smooth velocity structures and to restrict the velocities within the fractured region to be less than or equal to the velocities of the unfractured basement rock.","","","","USDOE","","United States","1994-01-01T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: Geophysics; Journal Volume: 59; Journal Issue: 1; Other Information: PBD: Jan 1994","","Medium: X; Size: pp. 102-112","","","W-7405-ENG-36; FG02-86ER13636","Journal ID: GPYSA7; ISSN 0016-8033; TRN: IM9413%%301","10.1190/geo1992-0156","","2016-05-25T00:00:00Z","143791","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/143791","","Geophysics","1","59"

An AE doublet is a pair of acoustic emissions with similar waveforms and adjacent locations on the same crack but which occur at different times. The relative source location is estimated by an analysis in the frequency domain. The relative distance between two AE sources is determined from the difference of P-S arrival time delays by cross-spectrum analysis. The relative direction is derived using a spectral matrix from the difference in P-wave polarization directions. They also propose a method to optimize the estimated relative location by using a group of AE doublets. The accuracy of the estimated source location was confirmed by performing field experiments. The relative locations of artificial wave sources about 150 m from a triaxial detector can be estimated with distance errors of less than 1 m, and direction errors of less than 3.8 degrees in both azimuth and inclination. Results of the application of this analysis on AE doublets in a geothermal field demonstrate its ability to evaluate deeper subsurface fractures.","","","","","","United States","1994-01-01T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: Geophysics; Journal Volume: 59; Journal Issue: 1; Other Information: PBD: Jan 1994","","Medium: X; Size: pp. 36-45","","","","Journal ID: GPYSA7; ISSN 0016-8033; TRN: IM9413%%296","10.1190/1.1443532","","2009-12-16T00:00:00Z","143786","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/143786","","Geophysics","1","59"

Hydrothermal fluids are presently being discharged at two vent fields about 3 km apart, Bent Hill and the area of active venting. The hydrothermally active chimneys at both Bent Hill and the area of active venting consist of anhydrite and Mg-rich silicates with minor pyrite, Cu-Fe sulfide, sphalerite, and galena. Hydrothermal discharge in these areas appears to be focused along extensional faults. At the Bent Hill massive sulfide deposit, clastic sulfide layers are interbedded with hydrothermally altered and unaltered hemipelagic and turbiditic sediment along the flanks of the sulfide mound. Sulfide textures and mineralogy suggest that the Bent Hill sulfide mound formed by the build-up and collapse of sulfide chimneys, the resedimentation of sulfide debris and the formation of clastic sulfide layers, and the infilling and replacement of clastic sulfides by hydrothermal fluids near vents. Sulfur isotope values that are consistently more positive than basaltic sulfur support the addition of seawater sulfur. Pb isotope values for the Bent Hill deposit that are transitional between midocean ridge basalt (MORB) and Middle Valley sediments indicate that the sulfides probably formed from fluids which originated in the oceanic crust but which have been modified by reaction with lower temperature (<274 C) fluids generated in the sedimentary pile, similar to those now venting in Middle Valley.","","","","","","United States","1993-12-01T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: Economic Geology (plus the Bulletin of the Society of Economic Geologists); (United States); Journal Volume: 88:8","","Medium: X; Size: Pages: 2037-2068","","","","Journal ID: ISSN 0361-0128; CODEN: ECGLAL","10.2113/gsecongeo.88.8.2037","","2016-05-19T00:00:00Z","7049377","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/7049377","","Economic Geology (plus the Bulletin of the Society of Economic Geologists); (United States)","","88:8"

Three major hydrothermal fields (Hine Hina, Vai Lili, and White Church) were discovered in the areas of the greatest differention of volcanic rocks. The type of hydrothermal deposit is controlled by the type of volcanism and by tectonic activity which increases from south to north. Three stages of sulfide formation are proposed and described. Vent fluids at Valu Fa have much higher metal contents than those at midocean ridges. Cl enrichment is best explained by mixing with deep brine rather than by subcritical phase separation and there is no evidence for a magmatic fluid contribution. Some characteristics of the fluids, such as low pH (2) and low concentration of H[sub 2]S, can be explained by subsea-floor sulfide formation. Vertical mineralogical zonation within the mound differs from midocean ridge deposits but is similar to that of a kuroko deposit. At the surface of the deposit, the virtual absence of pyrite and the high amount of sphalerite, barite, tennantite, galena, and locally, native gold are remarkable. Compared to midocean ridges, Lau basin deposits are enriched in Ba, Zn, As, Pb, Ag, Au, and Hg and depleted in Mo, Se, and Co. Their mineralogy, chemical composition, and geologic setting show that the southern Lau basin deposits are intermediate between oceanic and continental back-arc deposits.","","","","","","United States","1993-12-01T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: Economic Geology (plus the Bulletin of the Society of Economic Geologists); (United States); Journal Volume: 88:8","","Medium: X; Size: Pages: 2154-2181","","","","Journal ID: ISSN 0361-0128; CODEN: ECGLAL","10.2113/gsecongeo.88.8.2154","","2016-05-23T00:00:00Z","7049432","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/7049432","","Economic Geology (plus the Bulletin of the Society of Economic Geologists); (United States)","","88:8"

The axial high is the principal locus of present magmatic intrusions. The TAG field contains three main areas of present and past hydrothermal activity: (1) an actively venting high-temperature sulfide mound; (2) two former high-temperature vent areas; (3) a zone of low-temperature venting and precipitation of Fe and Mn oxide deposits. The volcanic centers occur at the intersections between ridge axis-parallel normal faults and projected axis-transverse transfer faults. The intersections of these active fault systems may act as conduits both for magmatic intrusions from sources beneath the axial high that build the volcanic centers and for hydrothermal upwelling that taps the heat sources. Radiometric dating of sulfide samples and manganese crusts in the hydrothermal zones and dating of sediments intercalated with pillow lava flows in the volcanic center adjacent to the active sulfide mound indicate multiple episodes of hydrothermal activity throughout the field driven by heat supplied by episodic intrusions over a period of at least 140 [times] 10[sup 3] yr. The sulfide deposits are built by juxtaposition and superposition during relatively long residence times near episodic axial heat sources counterbalanced by mass wasting in the tectonically active rift valley of the slow-spreading oceanic ridge. Hydrothermal reworking of a relict hydrothermal zone by high-temperature hydrothermal episodes has recrystallized sulfides and concentrated the first visible primary gold reported in a deposit at an oceanic ridge.","","","","","","United States","1993-12-01T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: Economic Geology (plus the Bulletin of the Society of Economic Geologists); (United States); Journal Volume: 88:8","","Medium: X; Size: Pages: 1989-2017","","","","Journal ID: ISSN 0361-0128; CODEN: ECGLAL","10.2113/gsecongeo.88.8.1989","","2016-04-26T00:00:00Z","7049433","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/7049433","","Economic Geology (plus the Bulletin of the Society of Economic Geologists); (United States)","","88:8"
"Velocity structure of the Long Valley caldera from the inversion of local earthquake P and S travel times","Romero, Jr, A E; McEvilly, T V; Majer, E L","15 GEOTHERMAL ENERGY; 58 GEOSCIENCES; LONG VALLEY; SEISMIC SURVEYS; CALDERAS; GEOTHERMAL EXPLORATION","A high-resolution tomographic study of the Long Valley region began in 1989 with the installation of a special fan array of eight three-component borehole (80-160 m depths) receivers on the northwestern rim of the caldera to provide the data necessary for a joint inversion for hypocenters and the three-dimensional P and S wave velocity structure in and below the caldera. The experiment specifically targeted the subsurface location of the previously inferred magma chamber beneath the Resurgent Dome. Additional coverage was provided by existing US Geological Survey and University of Nevada, Reno seismographic networks. The authors employed the progressive inversion scheme of Thurber, with cubic spline interpolation after Michelini and McEvilly. The final model is based on data from 280 well-distributed local earthquakes. Some 6900 arrival times were used, including about 700 S wave times from the three-component stations. The resulting velocity structure reflects the known geology, defining the low-velocity Sierran block and highland terrane. No isolated distinct low-velocity anomalies are revealed beneath the caldera floor, although a diffuse zone of reduced velocity persists to a depth of about 8 km. These lower velocities may be related to hydrothermal alteration and/or extensive fractures. The Vp/Vs structure contains significant lateral variation within and beneath the caldera to about 8 km depth, and these variations can be related to accepted models of the active geothermal system. The lack of a significant S wave velocity anomaly, along with the normal or low values of the Vp/Vs ratio, argues against the presence of a sizable and distinct magma body at shallow to midcrustal depth beneath Long Valley caldera, although a very low percentage of partial melt cannot be precluded. 37 refs., 7 figs.","","","","USDOE","","United States","1993-11-10T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: Journal of Geophysical Research; Journal Volume: 98; Journal Issue: B11; Other Information: PBD: 10 Nov 1993","","Medium: X; Size: pp. 19869-19879","","","AC03-76SF00098","Journal ID: JGREA2; ISSN 0148-0227; TRN: 95:002473-0002","10.1029/93JB01553","","2016-04-21T00:00:00Z","67926","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/67926","","Journal of Geophysical Research","B11","98"

After acquiring three geothermal plants, a power contract and 11,000 acres of geothermal leaseholds, officials at Magma Power Co. can probably wipe their brows, take a deep breath and agree that is has been a big year. The San Diego-based company acquired the three projects in March. The leaseholds came from Unocal and are in the Imperial Valley of California, close to the four geothermal plants Magma operates near the Salton Sea. Overnight, Magma's generating capacity increased 50 percent, from 164 MW to 244 MW, and revenues, as measured on a pro forma basis, were boosted 60 percent to $174 million from $108 million in fiscal 1992. By most standards, that qualifies as a big year. No wonder, then, that Magma's stock (MGMA:NASDAQ) has been this year's best performing public, independent energy stock by far, soaring 17.8 percent to about $38 a share through August 31. That's way ahead of Standard Poor's 500 Index, which increased 5.7 percent during the same time. The industry's other major independent geothermal player, California Energy Co., based in Omaha, Neb., is a strong competitor with Magma for geothermal assets. Both companies are nearly even in terms of megawatt capacity, and both are pursuing an aggressive expansion strategy as they begin to reach global markets. California Energy has begun implementing its own plans for rapid growth. Its stock (CE:NYSE, PSE, LSE) has outperformed the S P 500, too, rising 6.7 percent through August 31 to trade at a little more than $18 a share. California Energy also acquired some Unocal assets, paying between $15 million and $19 million for 26,000 acres of reserves in the Glass Mountain area in Northern California. While Magma acquired three operating plants able to generate 80 MW and a power contract to supply 20 MW more, California Energy acquired leases and wells.","","","","","","United States","1993-11-01T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: Independent Energy; (United States); Journal Volume: 23:9","","Medium: X; Size: Pages: 16, 18-19","","","","Journal ID: ISSN 1043-7320; CODEN: IDPEEW","","","2009-12-16T00:00:00Z","5318740","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/5318740","","Independent Energy; (United States)","","23:9"

Under forseeable economics and technology, extraction of geothermal resources is limited to the upper few kilometres of the earth's crust. At these depths, the global distribution of geothermal resources is primarily controlled by plate-tectonic features. Geothermal resources related to igneous intrusions in the upper crust occur along spreading ridges, subduction zones, inter-arc basins, and melting anomalies. Geothermal resources unrelated to igneous intrusions in the upper crust occur most commonly in porous sedimentary rocks near convergent or divergent plate boundaries where regional heat flow is high. Geothermal reservoirs at pressures well in excess of hydrostatic occur commonly in young tectonic basins characterized by high rates of sedimentation and subsidence; these reservoirs are commonly termed [open quotes]geopressured.[close quotes] The hydrologic properties of crustal rocks are very important in determining location, size, and type of geothermal resource. Hot dry rock can result from solidification of a young intrusive body or from conductive heating of impermeable rock around such a body. Convective hydrothermal systems result either from convection of meteoric water around young intrusive bodies or from deep circulation of meteoric water along fracture zones. Geopressured reservoirs are formed in deep sedimentary basins when escape of connate water and water produced by the thermal dehydration of clays is impeded by sediments of low permeability.","","","","","","United States","1993-11-01T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: Geo-Heat Center Quarterly Bulletin; (United States); Journal Volume: 15:2","","Medium: X; Size: Pages: 1-10","","","","Journal ID: ISSN 0276-1084; CODEN: GCQBDW","","","2009-12-16T00:00:00Z","5462134","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/5462134","","Geo-Heat Center Quarterly Bulletin; (United States)","","15:2"

SOLVGAS and GASWORKS compute simultaneous equilibria by solving simultaneously a set of mass balance and mass action equations written for all gas species and for all gas-solid or gas-liquid equilibria. The programs interface with a thermo-chemical data base, GASTHERM, which contains coefficients for retrieval of the equilibrium constants from 25[degrees] to 1200[degrees]C. The programs and data base model dynamic chemical processes in 30- to 40-component volcanic-gas systems. The authors can model gas evaporation from magma, mixing of magmatic and hydrothermal gases, precipitation of minerals during pressure and temperature decrease, mixing of volcanic gas with air, and reaction of gases with wall rock. Examples are given of the gas-evaporation-from-magma and precipitation-with-cooling calculations for volcanic gases collected from Mt. St. Helens in September 1981. The authors predict: (1) the amounts of trace elements volatilized from shallow magma, deep magma, and wall rock, and (2) the solids that precipitate from the gas upon cooling. The predictions are tested by comparing them with the measured trace-element concentrations in gases and the observed sublimate sequence. This leads to the following conclusions: (1) most of the trace elements in the Mt. St. Helens gases are volatilized from shallow magma as simple chlorides; (2) some elements (for example, Al, Ca) exist dominantly in rock aerosols, not gases, in the gas stream; (3) near-surface cooling of the gases triggers precipitation of oxides, sulfides, halides, tungstates, and native elements; and (4) equilibrium cooling of the gases to 100[degrees]C causes most trace elements, except for Hg, Sb, and Se, to precipitate from the gas. 94 refs., 30 figs., 7 tabs.","","","","","","United States","1993-10-01T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: American Journal of Science; (United States); Journal Volume: 293:8","","Medium: X; Size: Pages: 758-864","","","","Journal ID: ISSN 0002-9599; CODEN: AJSCAP","10.2475/ajs.293.8.758","","2016-05-30T00:00:00Z","5582648","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/5582648","","American Journal of Science; (United States)","","293:8"

Geothermal exploration was started in 1962, and the first large commercial power plants came on-line in 1979 in two fields. By 1984, four geothermal fields had a combined installed capacity of 890 MWe and in 1992 these plants supplied about 20% of the country`s electric needs. Geothermal energy development was stimulated in the mid-1970s by the oil crisis and rapidly growing power demand, government support, available foreign funding, and a combination of private and government investment and technical expertise. However, no new geothermal capacity has been added since 1984, despite the growing demand for energy and the continuing uncertainty in the supply of crude oil. The Philippines` geothermal capacity is expected to expand by 270--1,100 MWe by the end of 1999. Factors that will affect the rate growth in this decade include suitable legislation, environmental requirements, financing, degree of private involvement, politics, inter-island electric grid connections, and viability of the remaining prospects.","","","","","","United States","1993-10-01T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: Geothermics; Journal Volume: 22; Journal Issue: 5-6; Other Information: PBD: Oct-Dec 1993","","Medium: X; Size: pp. 353-367","","","","Journal ID: GTMCAT; ISSN 0375-6505; TRN: IM9413%%323","10.1016/0375-6505(93)90024-H","","2009-12-16T00:00:00Z","143813","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/143813","","Geothermics","5-6","22"

The field is associated with a 0.5 Ma dacite dome on the southeastern flank of the Late Pliocene to Quaternary Mt. Makiling stratovolcano. The reservoir occurs within pre-Makiling andesite flows and pyroclastic rocks capped by the volcanic products of Mt. Makiling. Initially, the reservoir was liquid-dominated with a two-phase zone overlying the neutral-pH liquid. Exploitation has resulted in an enlargement of the two-phase zone, return to the reservoir of separated waste liquid that has been injected, scaling in the wellbores and rock formation, and influx of cooler groundwaters. Return of injected waters to the reservoir and scaling have been the major reservoir management concerns. These have been mitigated effectively by relocating injection wells farther away from the production area and by dissolving scale from wells with an acid treatment.","","","","","","United States","1993-10-01T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: Geothermics; Journal Volume: 22; Journal Issue: 5-6; Other Information: PBD: Oct-Dec 1993","","Medium: X; Size: pp. 381-394","","","","Journal ID: GTMCAT; ISSN 0375-6505; TRN: IM9413%%325","10.1016/0375-6505(93)90026-J","","2009-12-16T00:00:00Z","143815","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/143815","","Geothermics","5-6","22"

In 1982, Tiwi became the world`s first water-dominated system to produce more than 160 MWe. Today the field supplies about 11% of Luzon`s electricity. Initially, the reservoir was single-phase liquid with a small, shallow steam zone on the east side. Temperature reversals in the first wells showed the east to be an outflow zone. As production began, reservoir pressure declined, two-phase conditions developed, and groundwater entered the reservoir from the east. As many productions wells cooled, brine production increased and generation decreased from about 280 MWe in 1983 to about 190 MWe in 1986. Improvements to surface facilities and new wells drilled farther west raised generation to about 280 MWe by mid-1993. Separated brine was first injected into the reservoir, but this lowered steam production; injection is now outside the field.","","","","","","United States","1993-10-01T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: Geothermics; Journal Volume: 22; Journal Issue: 5-6; Other Information: PBD: Oct-Dec 1993","","Medium: X; Size: pp. 403-416","","","","Journal ID: GTMCAT; ISSN 0375-6505; TRN: IM9413%%327","10.1016/0375-6505(93)90028-L","","2009-12-16T00:00:00Z","143817","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/143817","","Geothermics","5-6","22"

A central core or chimney, with a diameter of about 1 km, a height of some 3 km and occupied by a high gas vapor (1.1 to 5.6 molal CO{sub 2}), is surrounded by an envelope of intermediate salinity water (7,000 mg/kg Cl) with temperatures between 250 and 350 C. The transition from purely vapor-dominated to liquid-dominated zones takes place via two-phase zones occupied by fluid mixtures of highly variable compositions. Much of the lower temperature, mature neutral pH Cl water is likely to have formed during an earlier stage in the evolution of the system. High temperatures of > 300 C, and associated alteration, are limited to wells AP-1D and the lower parts of AP-2D and are ascribed to re-heating by recent magmatic intrusions. The isotopic composition of the well discharges suggests that they contain some 40 to 50% of magmatic water. Alto Peak is considered a typical example of hydrothermal systems associated with many dormant volcanoes.","","","","","","United States","1993-10-01T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: Geothermics; Journal Volume: 22; Journal Issue: 5-6; Other Information: PBD: Oct-Dec 1993","","Medium: X; Size: pp. 479-519","","","","Journal ID: GTMCAT; ISSN 0375-6505; TRN: IM9413%%332","10.1016/0375-6505(93)90033-J","","2009-12-16T00:00:00Z","143822","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/143822","","Geothermics","5-6","22"

They were identified using gas compositions and equilibria involving H{sub 2}, H{sub 2}S, CH{sub 4} and CO{sub 2} to calculate temperature and vapor fraction in the reservoir. The first process is pressure drawdown in the southern part of the field, producing a local increase in the vapor fraction, with the liquid maintaining a high measured temperature, close to 300 C. The second process is vapor loss from an original liquid phase during its ascent through fractures. Wells affected by this process show high degrees of vapor loss (> 10%) when evaluated at the original high temperature of the liquid (290--300 C). But if vapor loss is modeled to occur at much lower temperatures (220--250 C), more realistic vapor losses (1--3%) are calculated. The last process involves mixing and cooling due to injection fluid returns to wells located in the northeastern part of the field. For some wells the fraction of injected brine in total temperatures can decline from 290 to 300 C to as low as 215--220 C, corresponding to periods when most of the produced fluids are derived from injected brine. Gas geothermometry gives a more reliable temperature estimate than quartz geothermometry for fluids with high fractions of injected brine, as the gas equilibria reflects the local reservoir temperature.","","","","","","United States","1993-10-01T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: Geothermics; Journal Volume: 22; Journal Issue: 5-6; Other Information: PBD: Oct-Dec 1993","","Medium: X; Size: pp. 535-553","","","","Journal ID: GTMCAT; ISSN 0375-6505; TRN: IM9413%%334","10.1016/0375-6505(93)90035-L","","2009-12-16T00:00:00Z","143824","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/143824","","Geothermics","5-6","22"

Even in systems with sulfate minerals as common components of alteration assemblages, indicating highly immature, oxidizing conditions at depth, the redox potential governing the concentrations of the reactive gases CO{sub 2}, H{sub 2}S, H{sub 2}, CH{sub 4} and CO approaches closely that expected for attainment of equilibrium with rock in more mature, reduced systems. The finding suggests that overall fluid compositions reflect more closely redox conditions established at the advancing front of interaction with primary rock rather than those of equilibrium with the set of secondary minerals left behind. With the exception of CO and NH{sub 3}, the close agreement in the compositions of gas samples, taken from pools and deep wells indicates that the secondary processes have only a slight effect on the vapors during their rise from drilled depths (1.8 km) to the surface and that samples from natural features may be taken to be representative of redox conditions at drilled depths.","","","","","","United States","1993-10-01T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: Geothermics; Journal Volume: 22; Journal Issue: 5-6; Other Information: PBD: Oct-Dec 1993","","Medium: X; Size: pp. 575-587","","","","Journal ID: GTMCAT; ISSN 0375-6505; TRN: IM9413%%336","10.1016/0375-6505(93)90037-N","","2009-12-16T00:00:00Z","143826","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/143826","","Geothermics","5-6","22"

The work involved the development of various numerical models of the field in order to understand the observed data. A three-dimensional porous medium model of the reservoir has been developed that matches well the observed pressure declines and enthalpy transients of the wells. Submodels representing the reservoir as a fractured porous medium were developed for the analysis of chemical transport of chlorides within the reservoir and the movement of the cold water front away from injection wells. These models indicate that the effective porosity of the reservoir varies between 1 and 7% and the effective permeability between 1 and 45 millidarcies. The numerical models were used to predict the future performance of the Palinpinon reservoir using various possible exploitation scenarios. A limited number of make-up wells were allocated to each sector of the field. When all the make-up wells had been put on line, power production gradually began to decline. The model indicates that under the assumed conditions it will not be possible to maintain the planned power production of 112.5 MWe at Palinpinon I and 80 MWe at Palinpinon II for the next 30 years, but the decline in power output will be within acceptable normal operating capacities of the plants.","","","","","","United States","1993-10-01T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: Geothermics; Journal Volume: 22; Journal Issue: 5-6; Other Information: PBD: Oct-Dec 1993","","Medium: X; Size: pp. 555-574","","","AC03-76SF00098","Journal ID: GTMCAT; ISSN 0375-6505; TRN: IM9413%%335","10.1016/0375-6505(93)90036-M","","2009-12-16T00:00:00Z","143825","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/143825","","Geothermics","5-6","22"

This lack of marketing and the system history of poor availability combined to reduce or eliminate interest in connecting on the part of local building owners and it served only the original 14 government buildings connected at start up. The revenue from these buildings, however, did not cover the entire cost of operating the system. As a result, the city was faced with a difficult decision - develop the revenue required to make the system self-supporting or shut it down. As a result, a marketing strategy for the system was developed. A flat rate was developed in which the rate is negotiable, but for most customers approximates 50% of the gas bill. In addition, the flat rate reduced customer retrofit costs because it is not necessary to buy a meter. Finally, the flat rate is a guaranteed value for the first 10 years of the contract. To reduce retrofit costs, the new marketing plan eliminates the requirement for a customer heat exchanger. New customers are now connected directly into the distribution system with district loop water used as the building heating medium. The state operates two programs which have been used in the marketing plan. The first of these is available only to taxable entities and is referred to as the Business Energy Tax Credit (BETC). This program offers business a 35% tax credit on the costs associated with connection to the geothermal district heat system (retrofit, design, permits, etc.). The second state program is the Small Energy Loan Program (SELP). This program will loan the entire cost of the energy project to the customer. The new marketing strategy for the Klamath Falls system has concentrated on offering the customer an attractive and easy to understand rate structure, reduced retrofit cost and complexity for this building along with an attractive package of financing and tax credits. 1 tab.","","","","","","United States","1993-08-01T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: Geo-Heat Center Quarterly Bulletin; (United States); Journal Volume: 15:1","","Medium: X; Size: Pages: 4-6","","","","Journal ID: ISSN 0276-1084; CODEN: GCQBDW","","","2009-12-16T00:00:00Z","5318648","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/5318648","","Geo-Heat Center Quarterly Bulletin; (United States)","","15:1"

Two main objectives of the program are: (1) to update and compile databases for wells and springs in 10 western states with temperature ranges of 20[degrees] to 150[degrees]C, and (2) to collect and interpret information on utility geothermal heat pump programs and energy use patterns of typical residential and commercial installations, along with energy savings and life-cycle costs. State geothermal resource teams are reviewing and updating their geothermal resource inventories which were completed as part of the USGS-DOE national assessment from 1977--1983. Each state is preparing a comprehensive digital database in table format and a resource map at a scale of 1:1,000,000. UURI and OIT are providing technical guidance and coordination, and UURI will complete 10 fluid chemistry analyses for each state. Simultaneously, they will collect and interpret demographic and other data to evaluate potential heat loads, fossil-fuel displacement, utility electrical-demand reduction and load-leveling opportunities, and environmental benefits for potential geothermal direct-heat applications. At the same time, they will undertake R D on better cost effective methods for locating low- and moderate-temperature geothermal resources and on siting successful test and product wells. They are collecting and interpreting information on the performance of residential and commercial installations of geothermal heat pumps (GHPs). This will yield information on utility marketing and incentive programs to expand GHP markets, the benefit to utilities from reduced peak demand and higher annual load factors, barriers to market entry, the potential total national energy savings contribution from GHPs, and suitability of GHPs for northern climates. 5 refs., 3 figs., 3 tabs.","","","","","","United States","1993-08-01T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: Geo-Heat Center Quarterly Bulletin; (United States); Journal Volume: 15:1","","Medium: X; Size: Pages: 17-21","","","","Journal ID: ISSN 0276-1084; CODEN: GCQBDW","","","2009-12-16T00:00:00Z","5318862","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/5318862","","Geo-Heat Center Quarterly Bulletin; (United States)","","15:1"

For this reason, the standard design practice is to isolate the geothermal fluid from the balance of the system through the use of a heat exchanger. In the majority of applications, the plate and frame heat exchanger has been the design of choice for this duty. Recently, a low-cost version of the plate heat exchanger, the brazed plate heat exchanger has become available. Due to their simpler construction these units can be economically produced in very small sizes. Considering the reduced cost these exchangers could greatly enhance the economics of small direct use geothermal systems. Brazed plate heat exchangers were placed in three geothermal fluids (Klamath Falls, OR; Boise, ID; and Pagosa Springs, CO) in order to determine the effect of H[sub 2]S on braze material. Based on subsequent analysis, it appears that the rate of corrosion of the braze material is much slower than corrosion of copper tube materials in the same fluids. Minimum expected life of the heat exchangers based on these corrosion rates is reported to be 12 years in fluids of less than 1 ppM H[sub 2]S and 10 years in fluids of less than 5 ppM. Based on these expected lives, and using a 3% inflation rate and 8% discount rate, brazed plate heat exchangers are a clear economic choice in which the capital cost is 50% or less of the cost of a plate and frame heat exchanger for the same duty. Due to their single pass design, brazed plate heat exchangers are generally limited to approach temperatures of 10[degrees]F or greater. Size limitations restrict applications to 100 gpm and/or 200 ft[sup 2] heat transfer surface area. 7 refs., 7 figs., 2 tabs.","","","","","","United States","1993-08-01T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: Geo-Heat Center Quarterly Bulletin; (United States); Journal Volume: 15:1","","Medium: X; Size: Pages: 7-12","","","","Journal ID: ISSN 0276-1084; CODEN: GCQBDW","","","2009-12-16T00:00:00Z","5318594","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/5318594","","Geo-Heat Center Quarterly Bulletin; (United States)","","15:1"

In response to increasing interest in renewable resources and prospects for expanding the county's economic development, a project was proposed to provide a county-wide inventory of geothermal resources and prospects, collect new field data and temperature gradients in areas lacking data, and preparation of initial plans for expanded resource utilization. One result of the Allen study was the location of twenty-six unreported sites of warm irrigation wells ranging from 68[degrees]F to 111[degrees]F in a somewhat linear alignment south of Alturas and several wells with temperatures of 75[degrees]F to 80[degrees]F north of Alturas along a similar alignment. Exploratory/production well AL-1 was drilled to total depth of 2,424 feet. Below 2,300 feet, a production zone at 187[degrees]F was encountered in fractured, low permeability, fine grained tuff. Well AL-2 was drilled to total depth of 1,940 feet in September and October 1991. The well produces 182[degrees]F fluid with shut-in pressure of 117 psi. Wellhead pressure decreased from 112 psi to 40 psi after ten days. The well is an apparent success and retrofit of the elementary/middle school complex is currently progressing. Plans are also progressing for heating the nearby city pool and potentially a planned community/horse activities center. Although longer term productivity is required to verify the total resource potential, it appears the resource could support a district heat system for at least the business district of Alturas. At current and near-term projected prices for natural gas, retrofit to gas will probably be more economic than a geothermal district heating system. Further development will likely be postponed for 10--20 years when natural gas will be in short supply and prices increased. 3 figs.","","","","","","United States","1993-08-01T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: Geo-Heat Center Quarterly Bulletin; (United States); Journal Volume: 15:1","","Medium: X; Size: Pages: 1-3","","","","Journal ID: ISSN 0276-1084; CODEN: GCQBDW","","","2009-12-16T00:00:00Z","5389956","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/5389956","","Geo-Heat Center Quarterly Bulletin; (United States)","","15:1"

It has been utilized for space heating in the city of Reykjavik since 1968. The subsurface rocks may be divided into an upper basalt group, a hyaloclastite group and a lower basalt group. A temperature reversal between 400 and 1,200 m depth with a maximum temperature of 100--110 C is observed inside the production field of the Ellidaar area. This indicates a hot water inflow from the north. Hydrological barriers are believed to separate the Ellidaar area from the Laugarnes geothermal area 2--3 km to the west. The Ellidaar area is situated next to a deep cold water system, associated with the Krysuvik fissure swarm, which interacts with the geothermal system. The cold water penetrates from the surface down to 750--1,000 m depth. It is suggested that a flow of colder water from the fissure swarm to the Ellidaar system mines heat along the way. During production colder water from groundwater systems above and adjacent to the geothermal system replaces the geothermal water produced. This has caused a 7--36 C drop in production temperatures.","","","","","","United States","1993-08-01T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: Geothermics (International Journal of Geothermal Research and its Applications); (United States); Journal Volume: 22:4","","Medium: X; Size: Pages: 329-348","","","","Journal ID: ISSN 0375-6505; CODEN: GTMCAT","10.1016/0375-6505(93)90006-9","","2016-05-09T00:00:00Z","5698234","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/5698234","","Geothermics (International Journal of Geothermal Research and its Applications); (United States)","","22:4"

All the volcano is discussed, but the focus is on its lower east rift zone (LERZ) because active exploration for geothermal energy is concentrated in that area. Kilauea probably has several separate hydrothermal-convection systems that develop in response to the dynamic behavior of the volcano and the influx of abundant meteoric water. Important features of some of these hydrothermal-convection systems are known through studies of surface geology and drill holes. Observations of eruptions during the past two centuries, detailed geologic mapping, radiocarbon dating, and paleomagnetic secular-variation studies indicate that Kilauea has erupted frequently from its summit and two radial rift zones during Quaternary time. Petrologic studies have established that Kilauea erupts only tholeiitic basalt. Extensive ash deposits at Kilauea's summit and on its LERZ record locally violent, but temporary, disruptions of local hydrothermal-convection systems during the interaction of water or steam with magma. Recent drill holes on the LERZ provide data on the temperatures of the hydrothermal-convection systems, intensity of dike intrusion, porosity and permeability, and an increasing amount of hydrothermal alteration with depth. The prehistoric and historic record of volcanic and seismic activity indicates that magma will continue to be supplied to deep and shallow reservoirs beneath Kilauea's summit and rift zones and that the volcano will be affected by eruptions and earthquakes for many thousands of years. 71 refs., 2 figs.","","","","","","United States","1993-08-01T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: Geothermics (International Journal of Geothermal Research and its Applications); (United States); Journal Volume: 22:4","","Medium: X; Size: Pages: 243-254","","","","Journal ID: ISSN 0375-6505; CODEN: GTMCAT","10.1016/0375-6505(93)90002-5","","2016-05-24T00:00:00Z","5698251","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/5698251","","Geothermics (International Journal of Geothermal Research and its Applications); (United States)","","22:4"

However, most studies to date have focused on the relatively shallow, low-salinity parts of the ground-water system, and the deeper hydrothermal system remains poorly understood. The rift zones of adjacent Mauna Loa volcano bound the regional ground-water flow system that includes Kilauea, and the area bounded by the rift zones of Kilauea and the ocean may comprise a partly isolated subsystem. Rates of ground-water recharge vary greatly over the area, and discharge is difficult to measure, because streams are ephemeral and most ground-water discharges diffusely at or below sea level. Hydrothermal systems exist at depth in Kilauea's east and southwest rift zone, as evidenced by thermal springs at the coast and wells in the lower east-rift zone. Available data suggest that dike-impounded, heated ground water occurs at relatively high elevations in the upper east- and southwest-rift zones of Kilauea, and that permeability at depth in the rift zones. Available data suggest that dike-impounded, heated ground water occurs at relatively high elevations in the upper east- and southwest-rift zones of Kilauea, and that permeability at depth in the rift zones (probably [le]10[sup [minus]15] m[sup 2]) is much lower than that of unaltered basalt flows closer to the surface ([ge]10[sup [minus]10] m[sup 2]). Substantial variations in permeability and the presence of magmatic heat sources influence that structure of the fresh water-salt water interface, so the Ghyben-Herzberg model will often fail to predict its position. Numerical modeling studies have considered only subsets of the hydrothermal system, because no existing computer code solves the coupled fluid-flow, heat- and solute-transport problem over the temperature and salinity range encountered at Kilauea. 73 refs., 7 figs., 2 tabs.","","","","","","United States","1993-08-01T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: Geothermics (International Journal of Geothermal Research and its Applications); (United States); Journal Volume: 22:4","","Medium: X; Size: Pages: 255-270","","","","Journal ID: ISSN 0375-6505; CODEN: GTMCAT","10.1016/0375-6505(93)90003-6","","2016-04-14T00:00:00Z","5630792","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/5630792","","Geothermics (International Journal of Geothermal Research and its Applications); (United States)","","22:4"

The rift zones and summit are underlain by dense, magnetic, and seismic velocity variations. The rift zones and summit are underlain by dense, magnetic, high P-wave-velocity rocks at depths of about 2 km less. The gravity and seismic velocity studies indicate that the rift structures are broad, extending farther to the north than to the south of the surface features. The magnetic data allow separation into a narrow, highly-magnetized, shallow zone and broad, flanking, magnetic lows. The patterns of gravity, magnetic variations, and seismicity document the southward migration of the upper east rift zone. Regional, hydrologic features of Kilauea can be determined from resistivity and self-potential studies. High-level groundwater exists beneath Kilauea summit to elevations of +800 m within a triangular area bounded by the west edge of the upper southwest rift zone, the east edge of the upper east rift zone, and the Koa'e fault system. High-level groundwater is present within the east rift zone beyond the triangular summit area. Self-potential mapping shows that areas of local heat produce local fluid circulation in the unconfined aquifer (water table). Shallow seismicity and surface deformation indicate that magma is intruding and that fractures are forming beneath the rift zones and summit area. Heat flows of 370--820 mW/m[sup 2] are calculated from deep wells within the lower east rift zone. The estimated heat input rate for Kilauea of 9 gigawatts (GW) is at least 25 times higher than the conductive heat loss as estimated from the heat flow in wells extrapolated over the area of the summit caldera and rift zones. 115 refs., 13 figs., 1 tab.","","","","","","United States","1993-08-01T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: Geothermics (International Journal of Geothermal Research and its Applications); (United States); Journal Volume: 22:4","","Medium: X; Size: Pages: 271-299","","","","Journal ID: ISSN 0375-6505; CODEN: GTMCAT","10.1016/0375-6505(93)90004-7","","2016-05-11T00:00:00Z","5569857","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/5569857","","Geothermics (International Journal of Geothermal Research and its Applications); (United States)","","22:4"

The present paper studies the convective instability in a two-dimensional porous enclosure with a horizontal baffle protruding from one of the side walls. The vertical side walls are insulated, while the top and bottom surfaces are maintained at lower and higher constant temperatures, respectively. The present work considers a baffle of high conductivity. We assume the baffle temperature can be considered constant throughout. We ask, for a given enclosure aspect ratio, is the addition of another physical constraint (such as lengthening a baffle) always stabilizing Is there an optimum baffle location and length such that the critical Rayleigh number is maximized In summary, several concluding remarks can be drawn in the following: (1) Other dimensions being same, a centered baffle always results in a more stable state than an off-centered baffle.

The first part of the paper discusses what may have occurred in the time period from the Lower Paleolithic (10[sup 5]--10[sup 6] years ago) until the end of the Neolithic. Throughout this period, the relationship of man with the various manifestations of terrestrial heat and its associated products was quite close and intense. In addition to the initial development of direct uses, this relationship with geothermal energy also involved man's cultural sphere. The second part of the paper discusses the development of direct uses and the importance that thermal balneology attained in some regions of the Mediterranean area in historical times. The exploitation and processing of hydrothermal products by the Etruscans, the blossoming of balneotherapy and the multiple functions of the spas in Roman times, the decline of all direct uses between the 5th and 6th centuries A.D. following the collapse of the Roman Empire, and the intensive exploitation of the manifestations of Larderello between the 11th and 16th centuries are discussed. The third part of the work refers to the Mesoamerican area (Mexico and neighboring regions) and covers the period extending from several millennia before the Christian era until the time of the voyages of Columbus. The last part of the paper attempts to reconstruct the birth and initial development of scientific thought regarding the various types of geothermal phenomena, starting from the oldest known illustration of a volcanic eruption until the end of the Middle Ages. 2 figs., 1 tab.","","","","","","United States","1993-08-01T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: Geo-Heat Center Quarterly Bulletin; (United States); Journal Volume: 15:1","","Medium: X; Size: Pages: 13-16","","","","Journal ID: ISSN 0276-1084; CODEN: GCQBDW","","","2009-12-16T00:00:00Z","5459545","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/5459545","","Geo-Heat Center Quarterly Bulletin; (United States)","","15:1"

The nature of the pre-1886 surface thermal activity indicates that boiling conditions prevailed in the upflow zone beneath the vicinity of the then-existing shallow Lake Rotomahana. On June 10, 1886, magma erupted through this part of the system, triggering violent volcanic and hydrothermal explosions that led to the formation of new fluid conduits and a large crater that filled to form the present Lake Rotomahana. Several years after the eruption, hot springs broke out along the line of 1886 craters southwest of Lake Rotomahana. The evolution of these features has been punctuated by spectacular geysers from 1900 to 1904 and a substantial hydrothermal eruption in 1917. The main effect of the 1886 volcanic eruption on the hydrothermal system was the perturbation of pressure gradients, causing abrupt near-surface cooling followed by gradual reheating. 23 refs., 4 figs.","","","","","","United States","1993-07-01T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: Geology; (United States); Journal Volume: 21:7","","Medium: X; Size: Pages: 643-646","","","","Journal ID: ISSN 0091-7613; CODEN: GLGYBA","10.1130/0091-7613(1993)021<0643:ICOTRW>2.3.CO;2","","2016-05-19T00:00:00Z","5807861","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/5807861","","Geology; (United States)","","21:7"

Reactors 7 to 9 are the subjects of this study. These organic-rich reactors may serve as time-tested analogues for anthropogenic nuclear-waste containment strategies. Organic matter helped to concentrate quantities of uranium sufficient to initiate the nuclear chain reactions. Liquid bitumen was generated from organic matter by hydrothermal reactions during nuclear criticality. The bitumen soon became a solid, consisting of polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons and an intimate mixture of cryptocrystalline graphite, which enclosed and immobilized uraninite and the fission-generated isotopes entrapped in uraninite. This mechanism prevented major loss of uranium and fission products from the natural nuclear reactors for 1.2 b.y. 24 refs., 4 figs.","","","","","","United States","1993-07-01T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: Geology; Journal Volume: 21; Journal Issue: 7; Other Information: PBD: Jul 1993","","Medium: X; Size: pp. 655-658","","","","Journal ID: GLGYBA; ISSN 0091-7613; TRN: 93:024949","10.1130/0091-7613(1993)021<0655:ROOMIT>2.3.CO;2","","2009-12-16T00:00:00Z","140074","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/140074","","Geology","7","21"

New investigations by a team of ten scuba divers during the multinational (France, Zaire, Germany, and Burundi) TANGANYDRO expedition (August-October 1991) found hydrothermal vents down to a depth of 46 m along north-trending active faults bounding the Tanganyika rift on the western side. Temperatures from 53 to 103 {degrees}C were measured in hydrothermal fluids and sediments. Veins of massive sulfides 1-10 cm thick (pyrite and marcasite banding) were found associated with vents at the Pemba site. At Cape Banza, active vents are characterized by 1-70-cm-high aragonite chimneys, and there are microcrystalline pyrite coatings on the walls of hydrothermal pipes. Hydrothermal fluid end members show distinctive compositions at the two sites. The Pemba end member is a NaHCO{sub 3}-enriched fluid similar to the NaHCO{sub 3} thermal fluids form lakes Magadi and Bogoria in the eastern branch of the rift. The Cape Banza end member is a solution enriched in NaCl. Such brines may have a deep-seated basement origin, as do the Uvinza NaCl brines on the eastern flank of the Tanganyika basin. Geothermometric calculations have yielded temperatures of fluid-rock interaction of 219 and 179 {degrees}C in the Pemba and Cape Banza systems, respectively. Abundant white or reddish-brown microbial colonies resembling Beggiatoa mats were found surrounding the active vents. Thermal fluid circulation is permitted by opening of cracks related to 130{degrees}N normal-dextral faults that intersect the north-south major rift trend. The sources of heat for such hydrothermal systems may relate to the existence of magmatic bodies under the rift, which is suggested by the isotopic composition of carbon dioxide released at Pemba and Cape Banza. 21 refs., 2 figs.","","","","","","United States","1993-06-01T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: Geology; Journal Volume: 21; Journal Issue: 6; Other Information: PBD: Jun 1993","","Medium: X; Size: pp. 499-502","","","","Journal ID: GLGYBA; ISSN 0091-7613; TRN: 97:001389-0002","10.1130/0091-7613(1993)021<0499:HVILTE>2.3.CO;2","","2009-12-16T00:00:00Z","543373","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/543373","","Geology","6","21"

At the beginning of 1993 the installed capacity had reached 5915 MW, an increase of 202% with respect to 1980. The percentage increase in installed capacity worldwide per annum in that same period, however, dropped from 13.5 in the 1980--1984 period to 9.6 in the period 1985--1989 and 0.5 in the 1990--92. Geothermal development has recently assumed a downward trend. There is evidence, however, to believe that the situation will improve in the near future. Based on data from reliable sources, approximately 10,200 MW will be installed throughout the world by the year 2000, increasing 72% with respect to 1993 figures. The greatest increase (167%) is expected in Asia. The percentage increase per annum in the world in the period 1993--2000 should rise to 8.1.

The proposed narrow heat source coincides with the Quaternary volcanic arc, whereas the wider heat source would extend 10-30 km west of the arc. To test the models, four new heat-flow holes were sited west of the Quaternary arc but within the area of the proposed wide heat source. The sites are separated from the Quaternary arc by topographic divides and (or) major river valleys, so that heating by regional-scale ground-water flow seems unlikely. Measured heat flow (76[+-]5 mW/m[sup 2]) was significantly lower than the values predicted by interpolation from an existing heat-flow contour map (95[+-]7 mW/m[sup 2]). The lower values are consistent with a narrow zone of magmatic heat sources. The complete heat-flow data set consists mostly of shallow (100-200 m) data and defines lobate highs around hot-springs groups in the Western Cascades. However, all of the deepest holes in the study area (44[degree]--45[degree]15 minutes N) show hydrologic gradient disturbances extending to depths >200 m, so the shallow data must be extrapolated with caution.","","","","","","United States","1993-06-01T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: Geothermics (International Journal of Geothermal Research and its Applications); (United States); Journal Volume: 22:3","","Medium: X; Size: Pages: 151-163","","","","Journal ID: ISSN 0375-6505; CODEN: GTMCAT","10.1016/0375-6505(93)90040-T","","2016-04-19T00:00:00Z","5821603","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/5821603","","Geothermics (International Journal of Geothermal Research and its Applications); (United States)","","22:3"

These systems, together with eleven active volcanoes, five degassing volcanoes and one caldera volcano (Lake Toba), are controlled by the Sumatra Fault Zone, an active mega shear zone that follows the median axis of the arc. At least half of the active and degassing volcanoes are associated with volcanic geothermal reservoirs containing magmatic gases and acid fluids. Large, low temperature resources exist in the Tertiary sedimentary basins of east Sumatra (back-arc region), where anomalously higher thermal gradients (up to 8 C/100 m) have been measured. Volcanic activity was not continuous during the Cenozoic; subduction and arc volcanism probably decreased after the Eocene as a result of a clockwise rotation of Sumatra. In the Late Miocene, subduction started again, and andesitic volcanism reached a new peak of intensity in the Pliocene and has been continuous ever since. Rhyolitic volcanism, which has produced voluminous ignimbrite flows, began later (Pliocene/Pleistocene).

In order to evaluate a geothermal system by geochemical techniques, the chemical compositions of the source waters have to be identified. The composition of the source water from a deep reservoir is particularly important for evaluating the geothermal potential of the system. The determination of the chemical compositions of these waters and their mixing fractions by the self-consistent least-squares method seems to be the most effective of the various mixing model calculations used for this purpose. A new method of water mixing model calculation had been devised and applied to a few geothermal fields in Kyushu, Japan. The computer program consists of an iterative least-squares calculation. The mixing fractions of the assumed source waters are first calculated by least-squares, using chemical compositions for the assumed source waters and the chemical data of samples; the chemical compositions of the assumed source waters are then calculated in a similar manner using the mixing fractions and the chemical data of samples. By repeating the two calculations, consistent sets of concentrations and mixing fractions are obtained for the source waters. The subsurface fluid mixing conditions of two geothermal fields in Kyushu, Japan were determined by this method. Reasonable results were thus obtained for subsurface mixing of geothermal waters and/or diluting of deep water with cold groundwater in these fields. This method is considered a useful tool for defining the subsurface behavior of geothermal fluids.","","","","","","United States","1993-06-01T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: Geothermics (International Journal of Geothermal Research and its Applications); (United States); Journal Volume: 22:3","","Medium: X; Size: Pages: 165-180","","","","Journal ID: ISSN 0375-6505; CODEN: GTMCAT","10.1016/0375-6505(93)90041-K","","2016-05-23T00:00:00Z","5888214","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/5888214","","Geothermics (International Journal of Geothermal Research and its Applications); (United States)","","22:3"

The thermal gradients is high all over the area; the He/Ne ratio, and He, CO[sub 2], and H[sub 2] concentrations have been determined in 259 samples. Compared with its surroundings, this area exhibits an overall positive CO[sub 2] anomaly, but the distribution of diffusive gases (He and H[sub 2]) allows one to distinguish three different sectors around the lake: (1) a northern sector with high CO[sub 2], and H[sub 2]/CO[sub 2], He/CO[sub 2], and He/Ne ratios close to the background value; (2) a south-eastern sector, characterized by the presence of cold fumaroles, with high He, H[sub 2], CO[sub 2] and He/Ne, and generally low H[sub 2]/CO[sub 2] and He/CO[sub 2] spots. Permeability is assumed to the main factor controlling the differences between the above three sectors. In sector 1, the flysch (1 km thick) is intruded by a great number of sills and dikes, and the underlying limestones are completely metamorphosed into marbles; CO[sub 2] is the late stage of a heavy degassing process. Sector 2 includes several volcanic spatter cones along the tectonic trends; the high permeability allows the deep gases to be ducted with minor changes. Sector 3 is an elongated strip with an anti-Apennine trend; diffusion of H[sub 2] only is the result of the thick (>3 km) unaltered flysch cover. In sector 3 the underground outflow of the lake through shallow volcanics entrains large quantities of air and masks any deep gases; the few anomalous spots reproduce situations like that of sector 2.

The well was planned to be vertical and the target area was a 100-m radius of 2800 m. Mainly, because of the formation inclination, strong bit walk tendency was encountered below 1200 m. Even with packed-hole assemblies (BHA), the well inclination buildup rate was over 1 deg per 30 m. With this buildup rate, the well inclination would be over 50 deg at 2800 m, and not only miss the target area, but could not reach total depth because of severe rotation drag in the very abrasive formation (tertiary: shale, dacitic tuff and andesitic tuff-breccia; pre-tertiary: slate, sandstone and andesitic tuff). Because a pendulum BHA did not help to drop the inclination, downhole motors with bent subs were employed. Totals of six and seven downhole motors for 12 1/4 and 8 1/2-in. hole sections, respectively, were run. The estimated formation temperature was over 350[degree]C below 1900 m, so two mud cooling towers and 500 m[sup 3] pit were used to cool the returned mud. These systems worked well, but at 2245 m the estimated mud circulation temperature on bottom went up to 150[degree]C and the stator rubber of the downhole motors unbonded and broke up after a 1-h run. Below that depth, only a packed hole BHA was employed, and the inclination increased from 6 deg at 2300 m to 14 deg at 2800 m.

The enactment of new regulations regarding air toxics and ARB's report entitled [open quotes]Public Exposure to Airborne Inorganic Arsenic in California[close quotes] suggest that geothermal energy producers in California must remain aware of the current atmospheric levels of arsenic at The Geyser. These producers must also be able to provide evidence of the species-specific nature of the airborne arsenic if the regulatory climate changes to include the inorganic species of arsenic in health risk assessment calculations.

If species-specific instead of total data on arsenic in the atmosphere are required by regulators, these results could be useful in evaluating future monitoring and assessment needs for arsenic at The Geysers. 12 refs., 1 fig., 1 tab.","","","","","","United States","1993-05-01T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: Journal of the Air and Waste Management Association; (United States); Journal Volume: 43:5","","Medium: X; Size: Pages: 765-768","","","","Journal ID: ISSN 1047-3289; CODEN: JAWAEB","10.1080/1073161X.1993.10467159","","2016-05-13T00:00:00Z","6093550","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/6093550","","Journal of the Air and Waste Management Association; (United States)","","43:5"

Aluto-Langano is a water-dominated gas-rich geothermal field, with a maximum temperature close to 360[degree]C, in the Lakes District region of the Ethiopian Rift Valley. The upflow zone for the system lies along a deep, young NNE trending fault and is characterized by boiling. As a result, the deep upflow zone loses some water as steam and produces a cooler saline shallow aquifer. The high partial pressure of carbon dioxide (about 30 bar in the reservoir) depresses the water table and restricts boiling to deeper levels. The main aquifer for the systems is in the Tertiary ignimbrite, which lies below 1400 m. The capacity of the existing wells is close to 7 MW[sub c]: the energy potential of the area is estimated to be between 3000 and 6000 MW[sub t] yr/km[sup 3], or 10-20 MW[sub c]/km[sup 3] for over 30 years.","","","","","","United States","1993-04-01T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: Geothermics (International Journal of Geothermal Research and its Applications); (United States); Journal Volume: 22:2","","Medium: X; Size: Pages: 101-116","","","","Journal ID: ISSN 0375-6505; CODEN: GTMCAT","10.1016/0375-6505(93)90050-W","","2016-05-06T00:00:00Z","7369214","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/7369214","","Geothermics (International Journal of Geothermal Research and its Applications); (United States)","","22:2"

In the case of Nestos geothermal field, considered to be a blind field (no surface manifestation), the geological and geophysical data were studied and intercorrelated. The geophysical results from SP, gravity, and VES data were compared with basement morphology and tectonics, as well as with the high temperatures measured in the area of main geothermal interest. As a result, the highly conductive subsurface zone and high temperatures observed on the ground surface were closely associated with a specific fracturing system. The latter was successfully mapped by the SP method. The SP method also defined certain fracture zones which, being highly electrically polarized, are hypothesized as future geothermal targets. All existing geophysical data have been re-evaluated, along with the SP data acquired over the geothermal field, and compared with the thermal contour maps and regional tectonics of the area. A deep borehole, drilled earlier in the area of the geothermal field, detected high temperatures in the basement (115[degree]C), but very low flowrate of the geothermal fluids. According to the results of this study, this is due to the fact that the borehole was located outside the area of the main fracture zones of geothermal interest.","","","","","","United States","1993-04-01T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: Geothermics (International Journal of Geothermal Research and its Applications); (United States); Journal Volume: 22:2","","Medium: X; Size: Pages: 117-134","","","","Journal ID: ISSN 0375-6505; CODEN: GTMCAT","10.1016/0375-6505(93)90051-N","","2016-05-16T00:00:00Z","7368798","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/7368798","","Geothermics (International Journal of Geothermal Research and its Applications); (United States)","","22:2"

The isotopic composition of the reservoir waters ([delta][sup 18]O = [minus]13[per thousand] and [delta]D= [minus]114.8[per thousand]) was calculated from data on post-flash deep thermal waters, using a two-stage steam loss model. The reservoir composition shows an oxygen shift of 2.4[per thousand] relative to the local meteoric water line. The composition of the recharge, obtained by removing the oxygen shift, is isotopically heavier than the average local meteoric waters, suggesting that the recharge may be from an area to the west of Mt Meager where isotopically heavier ground-waters are likely to be found. The small [delta][sup 18]O shift of the deep high-temperature waters is indicative of dominance of fracture-related permeability in the reservoir. Analyses of the chemistry and the temperature of the waters from hot springs and shallow thermal wells suggests that these waters have evolved from the deep geothermal waters through dilution by meteoric waters and about 40C adiabatic cooling (steam loss).","","","","","","United States","1993-04-01T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: Geothermics (International Journal of Geothermal Research and its Applications); (United States); Journal Volume: 22:2","","Medium: X; Size: Pages: 79-89","","","","Journal ID: ISSN 0375-6505; CODEN: GTMCAT","10.1016/0375-6505(93)90048-R","","2016-05-24T00:00:00Z","7368799","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/7368799","","Geothermics (International Journal of Geothermal Research and its Applications); (United States)","","22:2"

The processes governing these fluids also produce vast reserves of methane hydrate which not only serves as a potentially vast source of natural gas but could also be one of the most critical contributors to global climate shifts manifested in glacial periods and atmospheric warming. Samples were obtained from an accretionaly prism, a site where the small Juan de Fuca tectonic plate is being pushed underneath the North American Plate. As the Juan de Fuca plate plows under, the western edge of the North American continent scrapes off kilometers of the plate's sediment cap. During the process, organic materials in the sediment are first converted into methane and then cooked. Instead of bubbling up as gas, the methane reaches a depth where the temperature in the sediments and pressure from the overlying seawater cause the methane to freeze with seawater, forming methane hydrate. If the oceans were to warm, the heat could potentially melt some of the hydrate layer and release the methane, which could produce a chain reaction of global warming.","","","","","","United States","1993-02-01T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: Sea Technology; (United States); Journal Volume: 34:2","","Medium: X; Size: Pages: 71","","","","Journal ID: ISSN 0093-3651; CODEN: SEATAD","","","2009-12-17T00:00:00Z","6718265","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/6718265","","Sea Technology; (United States)","","34:2"

This approach to chemical geothermometry was initially proposed by Reed and Spycher. Its advantage over individual solute geothermometers such as the silica and the Na-K and Na-K-Ca geothermometers is that it allows a distinction to be made between equilibrated and non-equilibrated waters. However, care should be taken in interpreting the results of multi-mineral/solute equilibria as the results depend on both the thermodynamic data base used for mineral solubilities and the activities of end-member minerals in solid solutions. When using old analytical data attention has to be paid to analytical methods, especially in the case of important constituents present at low concentrations in the fluid, such as aluminium, for which analytical results obtained by two methods yielded very different equilibrium temperatures. The results for selected wells in Iceland, presented here, indicate that the geothermometry results are with few exceptions within 20 C of measured aquifer temperatures, and within 10 C for about half the wells considered. The method responds rapidly to changes such as cooling or mixing.","","","","","","United States","1993-02-01T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: Geothermics (International Journal of Geothermal Research and its Applications); (United States); Journal Volume: 22:1","","Medium: X; Size: Pages: 17-37","","","","Journal ID: ISSN 0375-6505; CODEN: GTMCAT","10.1016/0375-6505(93)90018-I","","2016-05-09T00:00:00Z","6097390","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/6097390","","Geothermics (International Journal of Geothermal Research and its Applications); (United States)","","22:1"

The resource consists of primarily dry steam which is produced from a low, porosity fractured graywacke. Over the last several years steam pressure at the Geysers has been dropping. Concern over decline of the resource has prompted research to understand its fundamental nature. A key issue is the distribution of fluid in the matrix of the reservoir rock. In this paper we interpret seismic compressional-wave velocity and attenuation data at the Geysers in terms of the geologic structure and fluid saturation in the reservoir. Our data consist of approximately 300 earthquakes that are of magnitude 1.2 and are distributed in depth between sea level and 2.5 km. Using compressional-wave arrival times, we invert for earthquake location, origin time, and velocity along a three-dimensional grid. Using the initial pulse width of the compressional-wave, we invert for the initial pulse width associated with the source, and the one-dimensional Q structure. We find that the velocity structure correlates with known mapped geologic units, including a velocity high that is correlated with a felsite body at depth that is known from drilling. The dry steam reservoir, which is also known from drilling, is mostly correlated with low velocity. The Q increases with depth to the top of the dry steam reservoir and decreases with depth within the reservoir. The decrease of Q with depth probably indicates that the saturation of the matrix of the reservoir rock increases with depth.","","","Lawrence Livermore National Lab.

The Li{sup +} insertion occurred effectively in LiCl solutions with higher concentration than 10 mmol/dm{sup 3}, but it could hardly occur in a 0.1 mmol/dm{sup 3} LiCl solution. Alkaline earth metal ions showed a stronger inhibition effect against the Li{sup +} insertion into the Pt/{lambda}-MnO{sub 2} electrode than alkali metal ions. However, since only Li{sup +} ions were taken up from a mixed solution of lithium and alkaline earth metal chlorides, a high selectivity of the electrode for lithium ions was shown. It was possible to recover lithium ions from geothermal water by this electrochemical method using the Pt/{lambda}-MnO{sub 2} electrode; the lithium uptake was 11 mg/g-MnO{sub 2}.","","","","USDOE","","United States","1993-01-01T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: Separation Science and Technology; Journal Volume: 28; Journal Issue: 1-3; Conference: 7. symposium on separation science and technology for energy applications, Knoxville, TN (United States), 20-24 Oct 1991; Other Information: PBD: Jan-Feb 1993","","Medium: X; Size: pp. 643-651","","CONF-911049-","","Journal ID: SSTEDS; ISSN 0149-6395; TRN: TRN: 93:000018-037","10.1080/01496399308019512","","2016-05-16T00:00:00Z","145162","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/145162","","Separation Science and Technology","1-3","28"

Because the solution of a tomographic inversion is often underdetermined, it is essential to carry out an uncertainty analysis on the solution, which is classically done by linearizing the problem at the vicinity of the computed solution. Earlier uncertainty analyses gave results which strongly depend on the chosen discretization interval: they have no physical meaning. The authors' goal is to compute numerical uncertainties that approximate the physical uncertainties. Limiting the study to Hilbertian model spaces, they theoretically derive a necessary and sufficient condition which yields the desired result: the norm chosen in model space has to bind the Frechet derivative of the forward map. Physically, this requires the velocity distribution and the reflectors to be smooth functions, an assumption which is quite compatible with the smoothness imposed to make use of ray theory. The required degree of smoothness depends on the space dimension (two- or three-dimensional). This theoretical study yields a new method which allows, in the classical framework of a linearization, calculation of uncertainties that are almost independent of the chosen model discretization interval: they are thus intrinsically related to travel time information. Hence the authors can predict how travel times determine the slowness distribution and the reflector geometries. Their method is validated for a simple example. As a result, a very fine parameterization of the model is needed for an accurate estimate of the uncertainties on the solution.","","","","","","United States","1992-12-10T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: Journal of Geophysical Research; (United States); Journal Volume: 97:B13","","Medium: X; Size: Pages: 19827-19844","","","","Journal ID: ISSN 0148-0227; CODEN: JGREA2","10.1029/92JB01739","","2009-12-17T00:00:00Z","7093124","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/7093124","","Journal of Geophysical Research; (United States)","","97:B13"

The third orthogonal source point gives propagation times characteristic of near-horizontal paths along the detected slow direction. The reflected VSP wave field contains both P and S energy.

Rare earth element inversions of the melt distribution in the mantle source region suggest that sufficient melt is generated under normal oceanic spreading centers to produce an 8.3 [plus minus] 1.5 km thick igneous crust. The difference between the thickness estimates from seismics and from rare earth element inversions is not significant given the uncertainties in the mantle source composition. The inferred igneous thickness increases to 10.3 [plus minus] 1.7 km (seismic measurements) and 10.7 [plus minus] 1.6 km (rare earth element inversions) where spreading centers intersect the regions of hotter than normal mantle surrounding mantle plumes. This is consistent with melt generation by decompression of the hotter mantle as it rises beneath spreading centers. Maximum inferred melt volumes are found on aseismic ridges directly above the central rising cores of mantle plumes, and average 20 [plus minus] 1 and 18 [plus minus] 1 km for seismic profiles and rare earth element inversions respectively. Both seismic measurements and rare earth element inversions show evidence for variable local crustal thinning beneath fracture zones, though some basalts recovered from fracture zones are indistinguishable geochemically from those generated on normal ridge segments away from fracture zones. The authors attribute the decreased mantle melting on very slow-spreading ridges to the conductive heat loss that enables the mantle to cool as it rises beneath the rift.","","","","","","United States","1992-12-10T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: Journal of Geophysical Research; (United States); Journal Volume: 97:B13","","Medium: X; Size: Pages: 19683-19715","","","","Journal ID: ISSN 0148-0227; CODEN: JGREA2","10.1029/92JB01749","","2009-12-17T00:00:00Z","7093375","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/7093375","","Journal of Geophysical Research; (United States)","","97:B13"

Location of the most massive sulfide structures appears to be controlled by intersections of ridge-parallel normal faults and other fracture-fissure sets that trend oblique to, and perpendicular to the overall structural fabric of the axial valley. As presently mapped, the field is about 200 by 400 m on a side and contains at least 15 large (> 1,000 m[sup 3]) sulfide edifices and many tens of smaller, commonly inactive, sulfide structures. The larger sulfide structures are also the most vigorously venting features in the field; they are commonly more than 30 m in diameter and up to 20 m in height. Maximum venting temperatures of 375[degrees]C are associated with the smaller structures in the northern portion of the field are consistently 20[degrees]-30[degrees]C lower. Hydrothermal output from individual active sulfide features varies from no flow in the lower third of the edifice to vigorous output from fracture-controlled black smoker activity near the top of the structures. Two types of diffuse venting in the Endeavour field include a lower temperature 8[degrees]-15[degrees]C output through colonies of large tubeworms and 25[degrees]-50[degrees]C vent fluid that seems to percolate through the tops of overhanging flanges. The large size and steep-walled nature of these structures evidently results from sustained venting in a mature hydrothermal system, coupled with dual mineral depositional mechanisms involving vertical growth by accumulation of chimney sulfide debris and lateral growth by means of flange development.","","","","","","United States","1992-12-10T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: Journal of Geophysical Research; (United States); Journal Volume: 97:B13","","Medium: X; Size: Pages: 19663-19682","","","","Journal ID: ISSN 0148-0227; CODEN: JGREA2","10.1029/92JB00174","","2009-12-17T00:00:00Z","6937229","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/6937229","","Journal of Geophysical Research; (United States)","","97:B13"

These stations would use the low temperature heat from the water that now occupies the former oil reservoirs to generate electricity. NASA recently retrofitted its engine test facility to enable it to use warm water from an underground aquifer as source water in a heat pump. A major policy guideline regarding electricity is issued by the California Energy Commission (CEC) every two years. This year, CEC appears to be revising its method for determining the total societal cost of various electricity supply options. The change may impact geothermal energy usage in a positive way. Virtually untapped geothermal resources in Preston, Idaho will be utilized for warm water catfish farming. Stockton State College in New Jersey will be the site of one of the nation's largest geothermal projects when it is completed in 1993. It is designed to satisfy the college's energy requirements at an estimated cost savings of $300,000 per year.

"Effective stress for transport properties of inhomogeneous porous rock","Berryman, J G","58 GEOSCIENCES; 15 GEOTHERMAL ENERGY; POROUS MATERIALS; HYDRAULIC TRANSPORT; ROCKS; FLUID FLOW; FLOW STRESS; STRAINS","General effective-stress rules are derived for various physical properties of inhomogeneous porous rocks. Some rigorous relations arising in the analysis show that the fluid (pore) pressure p{sub f} is least effective at counteracting the changes caused by confining pressure for the solid (grain) volume; p{sub f} is more effective for the total (solid plus pore) volume; p{sub f} is still more effective for the pore volume; and p{sub f} is most effective at maintaining the fluid content of the pores. Although these results are expected intuitively, this analysis provides the first rigorous demonstration. During analysis of coefficients, care is taken to distinguish between rigorous inequalities (following from thermodynamics) and empirical inequalities (commonly observed, but not required by thermodynamics). For microscopically inhomogeneous rocks (the Gassmann limit), it is shown that the confining pressure is always at least as effective as the fluid pressure at changing the fluid permeability; therefore, it is impossible to use any {open_quotes}equivalent homogeneous rock{close_quotes} to explain experimental results of Zoback and Byerlee and others (wherein it has been shown experimentally that the permeability sometimes is more strongly influenced by fluid pressure than confining pressure). The authors show that the equivalent homogeneous rock paradigm may be successfully replaced by the {open_quotes}two-constituent porous medium{close_quotes} paradigm. In principle, the new paradigm can explain the data, but new measurements of pore compressibilities are required before quantitative comparisons can be made. 103 refs., 7 figs., 2 tabs.","","","","USDOE","","United States","1992-11-10T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: Journal of Geophysical Research; Journal Volume: 97; Journal Issue: B12; Other Information: PBD: 10 Nov 1992","","Medium: X; Size: pp. 17409-17424","","","W-7405-ENG-48","Journal ID: JGREA2; ISSN 0148-0227; TRN: 95:002701-0003","10.1029/92JB01593","","2016-05-10T00:00:00Z","83358","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/83358","","Journal of Geophysical Research","B12","97"

Mixtures of the plumes with ambient seawater were sampled during the 1989 CYAPOL cruise and found to contain significant amounts of CH[sub 4], Mn, Fe, Zn, and Ni, which are comparable in concentration to those found over hydrothermal fields on the EPR and in megaplumes over the Juan de Fuca Ridge. Above Teahitia volcano, CH[sub 4] shows maximum concentrations of 8 nmol/kg, Mn concentrations of 19 nmol/kg, and Fe concentrations of 125 nmol/kg. The concentrations were much higher during an earlier SO-47 cruise in 1987, reaching maximum values of 14 nmol CH[sub 4]/kg and 60 nmol Mn/kg. By contrast, the Macdonald seamount plume shows an opposite trend reaching very high concentrations of 350 nmol/kg CH[sub 4], 250 nmol Mn/kg, and 3,920 nmol Fe/kg during the CYAPOL cruise when the volcano was at an eruptive stage with high seismic activity. Mapping of the element concentrations in the water column shows the plume ceiling, or anomaly maxima, to occur to several hundred meters above the seafloor and up to several kilometers (>5 km) from the vents on Macdonald seamount. Multiple maxima in hydrocast profiles indicate the presence of several distinct hydrothermal vents at different water depths on Teahitia and on the western flank of Macdonald seamount.

Dissolved Si correlates linearly with sample temperature, suggesting that the solutions sampled from numerous vents in the [approximately]20 m diameter field have a common source and that Si can be used as a conservative tracer for mixing of the vent fluids with ambient seawater. These juvenile inputs likely reflect the shallow, hotspot setting of this hydrothermal system.

New B, Gd, and Sm analyses have been made on a suite of Yellowstone rhyolites, including fresh and partially devitrified glassy obsidian from surface exposures of several flows, a drill-core of increasing degrees of alteration in the Biscuit Basin Flow, and two drill-cores from other flows. Within the Biscuit Basin Flow, the Sm and Gd concentrations remain rather constant and behave conservatively, independent of alteration. Boron decreases from about 10 to 3 ppm with progressive alteration, and Li increases from about 40 ppm by a factor of 2-3 in the most altered rocks. Obsidians from the Valles and Long Valley calderas show greater Li loss during alteration. All the rhyolitic rocks lose B during aqueous alteration; the waters acquire both B and Li, but proportionately much more B. Natural waters of all kinds, including those from the three calderas, show six orders of magnitude range in aqueous B and Li, with a high degree of linear correlation and an average ratio B/Li essentially constant at 4.0. The linearity mainly expresses processes of dilution and concentration: reactions specific to B or Li engender waters with deviating B/Li.","","","","","","United States","1992-10-01T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: Geochimica et Cosmochimica Acta; (United States); Journal Volume: 56:10","","Medium: X; Size: Pages: 3723-3731","","","W-31109-ENG-38","Journal ID: ISSN 0016-7037; CODEN: GCACAK","10.1016/0016-7037(92)90165-F","","2009-12-17T00:00:00Z","6917738","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/6917738","","Geochimica et Cosmochimica Acta; (United States)","","56:10"

An investigation of interactions between the biology of the sulfide worm and chimney mineralization has led to a hypothesis linking formation of marcasite-pyrite crusts on chimney surfaces to colonization and tube-building by the worms. Marcasite precipitation beneath worm tubes and worm migration to newly formed areas of chimney together create a moving front of biomineralization that keeps pace with chimney growth. Sulfide oxidation by this organism can potentially produce enough S to form the FeS[sub 2] crusts. The marcasite-pyrite crusts act as a sealing layer within the outer chimney wall, reducing inflow of cold seawater or outflow of hydrothermal fluid. This may enhance temperature increases within the chimney conduit and hasten replacement of the early anhydrite matrix in the chimney wall by higher temperature sulfides.","","","","","","United States","1992-10-01T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: Geology; (United States); Journal Volume: 20:10","","Medium: X; Size: Pages: 895-898","","","","Journal ID: ISSN 0091-7613; CODEN: GLGYBA","10.1130/0091-7613(1992)020<0895:IOATBP>2.3.CO;2","","2016-04-14T00:00:00Z","7006423","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/7006423","","Geology; (United States)","","20:10"

The experiments made use of the assemblage hematite-magnetite to buffer key aspects of fluid chemistry. FeCl[sup +] and FeCl[sub 2][sup 0] species were found to best fit the experimental data. At relatively low temperatures (e.g., 200C), the authors' data agree with recent spectroscopic data, which show FeCl[sup +] to be the dominant form of dissolved Fe in low to moderate Cl-bearing aqueous fluids. At higher temperatures, however, FeCl[sub 2][sup 0] becomes increasingly significant. Taking explicit account of recent revisions to the HKF equation of state for aqueous species, they determined association constants for FeCl[sup +] and FeCl[sub 2][sup 0] as a function of temperature and pressure from measured pH, as well as dissolved Fe and Cl concentrations. Fe-Cl complex data, along with their previously determined data for the effect of dissolved NaCl on activity coefficients of H[sub 2(aq)] and H[sub 2]S[sub (aq)] at elevated temperatures and pressures, permit one to constrain subseafloor hydrothermal alteration processes from dissolved Cl, Fe, H[sub 2(aq)], and/or H[sub 2]S[sub (aq)] concentrations of hot spring fluids. For example, assuming vent fluids at mid-ocean ridges equilibrate with pyrite-magnetite, subseafloor temperatures and pH[sub (in situ)] values of 372-394C and 4.6-5.2, respectively, are indicated. These results are in good agreement with phase equilibria constraints involving plagioclase-epidote-quartz coexisting with Na-Ca-Cl fluids.","","","","","","United States","1992-10-01T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: Geochimica et Cosmochimica Acta; (United States); Journal Volume: 56:10","","Medium: X; Size: Pages: 3681-3692","","","","Journal ID: ISSN 0016-7037; CODEN: GCACAK","10.1016/0016-7037(92)90161-B","","2016-05-23T00:00:00Z","7170479","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/7170479","","Geochimica et Cosmochimica Acta; (United States)","","56:10"

Growth during the first two decades (1960-1980) was characterized by a single utility's development of one dry-steam resource. After 1983, growth shifted toward independent power producers, and development of water-dominated geothermal resources at several locations. In the absence of significant changes in demand, incentives, or the regulatory process, new geothermal generating capacity, through 1995, will probably not exceed 500 MW. The U.S. geothermal industry must increase its inventory of characterized geothermal reservoirs in order to meet the expected demand for rapid geothermal development before the year 2000.","","","","","","United States","1992-10-01T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: Energy Sources; (United States); Journal Volume: 14:4","","Medium: X; Size: Pages: 443-456","","","","Journal ID: ISSN 0090-8312; CODEN: EGYSA","10.1080/00908319208908739","","2016-05-19T00:00:00Z","7004034","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/7004034","","Energy Sources; (United States)","","14:4"

They examine and reject the hypothesis that these data represent a fictitious isochron, that is, a linear array in [sup 87]Rb/[sup 86]Sr-[sup 87]Sr/[sup 86]Sr space that forms by mixing of two components and that does not provide information about the timing of the event that generated the array. A more detailed examination of the Rb/Sr data from throughout the Bonneterre Formation reveals the likelihood that the Magmont 'isochron' is the result of mixing and, as such, does not provide information regarding the age of mineralization. The evidence presented in this paper contradicts the claim of Stein and Kish (1991, 1985) that mixing cannot produce the linear array of data in [sup 87]Sr/[sup 86]Sr-[sup 87]Rb/[sup 86]Sr space observed from Magmont glauconites: on the contrary, the Magmont data appear to be an extension, at higher Sr and lower [sup 87]Sr/[sup 86]Sr, of a mixing trend evident in 25 of 27 of the glauconites of the region. Because the linear array of Magmont data in [sup 87]Rb/[sup 86]Sr-[sup 87]Sr/[sup 86]Sr space probably formed by mixing as part of a larger array from the region, rather than by complete isotopic homogenization of Sr, it is a fictitious isochron: the slope of the line principally reflects the original Paleozoic age of the glauconites and provides no information about the timing of the event that generated the array.","","","","","","United States","1992-09-01T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: Journal of Geology; (United States); Journal Volume: 100:5","","Medium: X; Size: Pages: 639-641","","","","Journal ID: ISSN 0022-1376; CODEN: JGEOAZ","10.1086/629614","","2016-05-13T00:00:00Z","6937566","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/6937566","","Journal of Geology; (United States)","","100:5"

The severity of U loss and, to a lesser extent Pb loss, varies with solution composition: in this case the 2 M NaCl solution induced more Pb and U loss than the 2% HNO[sub 3] solution at the same P-T conditions. Scanning electron microscopy of the run products also revealed a range of corrosion-related surface features, which suggests that some of the observed trends in Pb and U loss must be attributed to zircon dissolution. Backscattered electron (BSE) imaging of the run products further suggests that partial homogenization of chemical zoning patterns occurred during the experiments. Microprobe analyses of treated and untreated grain show that both populations have a similar range of Hf contents. Thus, the apparent loss of sharp, well-defined zoning features is most likely due to small-scale 'smearing out' of formerly sharp chemical gradients and is perhaps related to the annealing of lattice defects caused by alpha-recoil damage. Thus, experimentally induced U-Pb isotopic discordance in zircon is a complex function of zircon stability and annealing effects.","","","","","","United States","1992-09-01T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: Geochimica et Cosmochimica Acta; (United States); Journal Volume: 56:9","","Medium: X; Size: Pages: 3551-3560","","","","Journal ID: ISSN 0016-7037; CODEN: GCACAK","10.1016/0016-7037(92)90398-3","","2016-05-30T00:00:00Z","6909680","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/6909680","","Geochimica et Cosmochimica Acta; (United States)","","56:9"

These calculations suggest that peptides, polypeptides, and proteins may survive hydrothermal alteration of organic matter depending on the rates of the hydrolysis reactions. Extremely thermophilic organisms may be able to take advantage of the decreased energy required to form peptide bonds in order to maintain structural proteins and enzymes at elevated temperatures and pressures.

Furthermore, the bottom hole circulating temperature (BHCT) is an important factor affecting a cement's thickening time, rheological properties, compressive strength, development, and set time. To estimate the values of BHCT, the geothermal gradient should be determined with accuracy.

The hydrothermal component of the pore fluids was quite variable, indicating the heterogeneous nature of the near-surface flow regimes. The bulk solids chemistry indicates that the suite of cores has encountered different amounts of cumulative hydrothermal exposure. Dissolution of biogenic silica and deposition of large amorphous silica clasts in the sediment are related to the extent of hydrothermal exposure.

The values, calculated by the formula, can contribute to geothermal exploration in Turkey by providing values that can be compared with the observed ones, and, by becoming second values for the calculation of geothermal gradients where only single downhole temperatures are available. The formula has been evolved by expressing the temperatures as the linear function of latitude (La), longitude (Lo) and elevation (H): T = a + b [center dot] La + c [center dot] Lo + d [center dot] H. The derived four least square equations are a [center dot] n + b [center dot] [Sigma](La) + c [center dot] [Sigma](lo) + d [center dot] [Sigma]H = [Sigma]T a [center dot] [Sigma](La) + b [center dot] [Sigma](La)[sup 2] + c [center dot] [Sigma](La)(Lo) + d [center dot] [Sigma]H(La) =[Sigma]T(La) a [center dot] [Sigma](Lo) + b [center dot] [Sigma](La)(Lo) + c [center dot] [Sigma](Lo)[sup 2] + d [center dot] [Sigma]H(Lo) = [Sigma]T(Lo) a[center dot] [Sigma]H + b [center dot] [Sigma]H(La) + c [center dot] [Sigma](Lo) + d [center dot] [Sigma]H[sup 2] = [Sigma]TH where n is the number of data sets. The calculation of sigma values and the solution of the set of equations have been performed by means of a personal computer. The resulting formula is: T = 57.487 [minus] 1.078 La + 0.102 Lo [minus] 0.00488H where latitude and longitude are expressed in degrees, and elevation in meters. The regional value at Ankara (latitude 39.9[degrees], longitude 32.9[degrees], elevation 894 m) is calculated as 13.5[degrees]C (the measured value at 1 m depth is 14.6[degrees]C) and at Adana.","","","","","","United States","1992-06-01T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: Geothermics (International Journal of Geothermal Research and its Applications); (United States); Journal Volume: 21:3","","Medium: X; Size: Pages: 415-418","","","","Journal ID: ISSN 0375-6505; CODEN: GTMCAT","10.1016/0375-6505(92)90090-V","","2016-05-27T00:00:00Z","7024564","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/7024564","","Geothermics (International Journal of Geothermal Research and its Applications); (United States)","","21:3"

The chemical composition and evolution towards the low enthalpy of the springs as compared to the high enthalpy of the geothermal fluids are affected by both the structural setting of the region and the deep hydraulic conditions. Recharge of both the shallow thermal aquifer and the deep geothermal systems takes place in the outcrop areas of Mesozoic carbonate rocks, which constitute the main potential geothermal reservoir in central Italy. The waters of meteoric origin are heated at depth, as a consequence of anomalous heat flow in the region; these waters acquire a CO[sub 2]-rich rising gas phase, equilibrate with the reservoir rocks and, finally, assume their Ca--HCO[sub 3]--SO[sub 4] composition. If these waters discharge rapidly from the border fault systems of the Siena-Radicofani basin they maintain their original composition. If, instead, they emerge from the inner faults of the graben, their temperature and dissolved solids increase so that they become Na--Cl with a high content of NH[sub 4], and H[sub 3]BO[sub 3].","","","","","","United States","1992-06-01T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: Geothermics (International Journal of Geothermal Research and its Applications); (United States); Journal Volume: 21:3","","Medium: X; Size: Pages: 401-404","","","","Journal ID: ISSN 0375-6505; CODEN: GTMCAT","10.1016/0375-6505(92)90089-R","","2016-05-09T00:00:00Z","7189101","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/7189101","","Geothermics (International Journal of Geothermal Research and its Applications); (United States)","","21:3"

The solution algorithm is based on stochastic dual dynamic programming, which decomposes the multi-stage stochastic problem into several one stage subproblems. Each subproblem corresponds to a linearized optimal power flow with additional constraints represented the hydro reservoir equations and a piecewise linear approximation of the expected future cost function. Each subproblem is solved by a customized network flow/Dual Simplex algorithm which takes advantage of the network characteristics of the hydro reservoirs and of the transmission system.

The authors measured {sup 129}I/I and {sup 36}Cl/Cl ratios in nine warm springs (formation springs), six cold springs with elevated levels of Cl and I (mineral springs), and five springs of recent meteoric origin. Dating of the I in the formation water indicated that sources of I in these waters are formation with minimum ages between 60 and 80 Ma. This age range is in good agreement with the ages of the Franciscan Complex and the Great Valley Sequence, the dominant formations in this area. Because the mineral waters are essentially formation water diluted with meteoric water, I in these waters is of the same origin. Residence times of the waters were calculated based on the build-up of {sup 129}I and {sup 36}Cl as a consequence of the presence of U and Th in the crust. The residence time of the formation waters in the Great Valley Sequence, the location for most of these springs, was probably not longer than 84,000 yr. The concentrations found for {sup 36}Cl and {sup 129}I in the mineral waters indicate that these water have residence times of similar magnitude in formation such as the Franciscan Complex or the Clear Lake Volcanics, which have slightly higher levels of U and Th than the Great Valley Sequence.","","","","","","United States","1992-05-01T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: Geochimica et Cosmochimica Acta; (United States); Journal Volume: 56:5","","Medium: X; Size: Pages: 2069-2079","","","","Journal ID: ISSN 0016-7037; CODEN: GCACA","10.1016/0016-7037(92)90330-L","","2016-05-26T00:00:00Z","5077570","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/5077570","","Geochimica et Cosmochimica Acta; (United States)","","56:5"

In general, the dissolution kinetics at constant pH were not zero order with respect to products in solution, and this nonlinear release persisted beyond the time when Ca and Si stoichiometric dissolution was reached. The failure to establish zero-order kinetics could not be attributed to the weathering of damaged surfaces or fine, broken particles. Leached layer depths, calculated from solution composition, ranged from 2.6-3.5 nm; but a Ca-depleted surface layer was observed by energy dispersive X-ray analysis only on the reaction fines. Anorthite dissolution in the presence of cation- and anion-exchange resins produced zero-order kinetics at sustained high rates. The authors hypothesize that these linear rates were due to the continuous removal of Al from solution by the resins. Consistent with these results, there was no effect of added Ca or Si on the rate of reaction; but the addition of Al slowed the initial rate of reaction at pH 3.6 and 6.0 but not at pH 3.0. Long-term dissolution studies (up to 4.5 ys) resulted in final reaction rates over two hundred times slower than previously reported for feldspar dissolution. These data are consistent with the idea that the presence of Al in solution and the incorporation of Al into the hydrous silanol surface slow the rate of anorthite dissolution and are important factors affecting the rate over all time periods.","","","","","","United States","1992-05-01T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: Geochimica et Cosmochimica Acta; (United States); Journal Volume: 56:5","","Medium: X; Size: Pages: 1815-1826","","","","Journal ID: ISSN 0016-7037; CODEN: GCACAK","10.1016/0016-7037(92)90312-7","","2016-05-23T00:00:00Z","6893471","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/6893471","","Geochimica et Cosmochimica Acta; (United States)","","56:5"

[sup 3]He/[sup 4]He ratios and noble gas concentrations are used to separate helium components originating from the atmosphere, tritium decay, crustal production, and mantle degassing. The characteristic distribution of measured helium concentrations and isotope ratios can be reproduced qualitatively by a simple two-dimensional advection/diffusion model. Other simple models isolating parts of the regional flow domain (recharge, discharge, and horizontal flow) are discussed and applied to derive quantitative information of helium fluxes due to degassing of the Earth's crust/mantle and on the dynamics of groundwater flow. The estimated helium flux of 0.7-4.5 [center dot] 10[sup 9] atoms [sup 4]He m[sup [minus]2] s[sup [minus]1] is lower than values derived from other deep groundwater circulation systems, probably because the relatively young upper few thousand meters of the sedimentary basin (Tertiary to Quaternary age) shield the flux from the deeper crust. The high mantle helium flux of up to 4.2 [center dot] 10[sup 8] atoms [sup 4]He m[sup [minus]2] s[sup [minus]1] is probably related to the Miocene volcanism or to continuing intrusion accompanying extension. By fitting calculated helium depth profiles to measured data in the discharge area, vertical flow velocities of the order of 1.5 mm/y are estimated. Assuming that flux of 0.7-4.5 [center dot] 10[sup 9] atoms [sup 4]He m[sup [minus]2] s[sup [minus]1] is representative for the entire basin, the turnover time of the regional groundwater flow system is estimated to be about 10[sup 6] y.","","","","","","United States","1992-05-01T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: Geochimica et Cosmochimica Acta; (United States); Journal Volume: 56:5","","Medium: X; Size: Pages: 2051-2067","","","","Journal ID: ISSN 0016-7037; CODEN: GCACAK","10.1016/0016-7037(92)90329-H","","2016-05-16T00:00:00Z","6893509","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/6893509","","Geochimica et Cosmochimica Acta; (United States)","","56:5"

Of the s species for which free energy approximations can be made, c will be compositionally independent, i.e., form a basis of composition space and hence of chemical potential space. This means that if the equilibrium model is correct, it should be possible to express the chemical potentials of all s species as linear combinations of the chemical potentials of any c basis species. An alternate solution to the inverse chemical equilibrium problem, based on chemical potentials of individual species rather than equilibria among several species, is presented in this paper. It will be termed the individual species approach and illustrated by an application to thermobarometry. The procedure is to solve a single set of equations relating pressure, temperature, and chemical potentials of all species of interest.","","","","","","United States","1992-05-01T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: Geochimica et Cosmochimica Acta; (United States); Journal Volume: 56:5","","Medium: X; Size: Pages: 1793-1800","","","","Journal ID: ISSN 0016-7037; CODEN: GCACAK","10.1016/0016-7037(92)90310-F","","2016-05-20T00:00:00Z","6937582","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/6937582","","Geochimica et Cosmochimica Acta; (United States)","","56:5"

Comparison of model predictions with experimental data indicates that they are within experimental uncertainty. Most experimental data sets are consistent within errors of about 7%. Although the parameters were evaluated from binary and ternary data, the model accurately predicts methane solubility in much more complicated systems like seawater and Salton geothermal brines.

About a third of its area and over half its heat and mass flux occur beneath the southern end of Lake Rotorua. Aquifer pressure beneath much of Rotorua City is controlled by the lake level, and is uniform due to high permeability in the rhyolitic host rocks. Pressure in the high temperature zone in the south east of the field is about 1.5 bar higher than the rhyolite, and is controlled by the elevation of the main discharges in the geyser area. Although significant natural changes in the geyser activity at Rotorua have occurred historically, the progressive decline of spring and geyser outflows observed since about 1970 was caused by increasing withdrawal from wells tapping geothermal fluids at up to 300 m depth beneath Rotorua City.","","","","","","United States","1992-04-01T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: Geothermics (International Journal of Geothermal Research and its Applications); (United States); Journal Volume: 21:1/2","","Medium: X; Size: Pages: 7-24","","","","Journal ID: ISSN 0375-6505; CODEN: GTMCA","10.1016/0375-6505(92)90065-H","","2016-04-28T00:00:00Z","7255896","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/7255896","","Geothermics (International Journal of Geothermal Research and its Applications); (United States)","","21:1/2"

Three distinct regions of low ({lt}30 Omega m) apparent resistivity are delineated. The southern of these outlines the Rotorua City Geothermal System which has an area of about 18 km{sup 2}, with the northern third covered by Lake Rotorua. The boundary of the system is characterized by a rapid lateral change in apparent resistivity which can be modeled as a single, near vertical zone in which the distance between hot and cold water is very narrow. Magnetic properties also change in the vicinity of the discontinuity in some areas, consistent with hydrothermal alteration having destroyed the magnetite in the rocks of the geothermal system. Hot water is believed to be rising, driven by buoyancy forces across the whole of the low resistivity region. There is some indication, particularly in the south, that the boundary between hot and cold fluids dips away from the field. A second low resistivity zone (the East Lake Rotorua anomaly) with an area of about 8 km{sup 2}, is believed to outline a second independent geothermal system, with surface manifestations on Mokoia Island, and on the eastern shore of the lake. High heat flow in lake bottom sediments, and a reduction in magnetic signature over this region supports this conclusion. A third resistivity low under the west of Lake Rotorua has no associated thermal features and is believed to be a fossil hydrothermal system. There is no apparent relationship between the location of the geothermal systems and the Rotorua caldera. The aeromagnetic measurements have delineated several highly magnetic bodies which cannot be linked with surface geology. These are believed to be caused by buried rhyolite dome complexes at shallow depth.","","","","","","United States","1992-04-01T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: Geothermics (International Journal of Geothermal Research and its Applications); (United States); Journal Volume: 21:1/2","","Medium: X; Size: Pages: 43-64","","","","Journal ID: ISSN 0375-6505; CODEN: GTMCA","10.1016/0375-6505(92)90067-J","","2016-05-30T00:00:00Z","7147932","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/7147932","","Geothermics (International Journal of Geothermal Research and its Applications); (United States)","","21:1/2"

New gravity measurements and residual gravity anomalies in Rotorua City are consistent with numerous rhyolite domes and ignimbrite sheets, interbedded with a thick sequence of poorly-compacted sediments. Within the city a gravity high extends from the shore of Lake Rotorua south to Whakarewarewa and is associated with a buried ridge, formed by the coalescing of two rhyolite domes. A gravity low centered near Linton Park suggests that rhyolites are thin or absent in this area and sediments extend to a depth of about 1 km. A quantitative analysis of the residual gravity anomalies was limited by insufficient information about the density, extent, and thickness of the material underlying the rhyolites, and the uncertainty in the distribution and density of silicification within the sediments.","","","","","","United States","1992-04-01T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: Geothermics (International Journal of Geothermal Research and its Applications); (United States); Journal Volume: 21:1/2","","Medium: X; Size: Pages: 65-74","","","","Journal ID: ISSN 0375-6505; CODEN: GTMCA","10.1016/0375-6505(92)90068-K","","2016-05-04T00:00:00Z","7246781","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/7246781","","Geothermics (International Journal of Geothermal Research and its Applications); (United States)","","21:1/2"

Pressures rose sharply during the Bore Closure Programme in 1987-88 and subsequently settled in a new steady state with most of the variation caused by rainfall changes. The winter withdrawal before the Bore Closure Programme was about 31,000 tonnes/day, and the summer withdrawal was about 20% less. The Bore Closure Programme reduced winter withdrawal to 11,000 tonnes/day and summer withdrawal was similarly reduced. Reinjection to production depth increased from less than 1000 tonnes/day to about 3500 tonnes/day. The size of the pressure rise during the Bore Closure Programme suggests that only about half the decline in pressure since 1960 can be attributed to withdrawal. A drop in groundwater pressure due to lower rainfall in the 1980s than in the 1960s and early 1970s is the most likely cause of the extra decline in geothermal pressures.","","","","","","United States","1992-04-01T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: Geothermics (International Journal of Geothermal Research and its Applications); (United States); Journal Volume: 21:1/2","","Medium: X; Size: Pages: 231-248","","","","Journal ID: ISSN 0375-6505; CODEN: GTMCA","10.1016/0375-6505(92)90079-O","","2016-05-09T00:00:00Z","7246553","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/7246553","","Geothermics (International Journal of Geothermal Research and its Applications); (United States)","","21:1/2"

The rate increased by a factor of {approximately} 2.3 for a strained sample ({rho} = 6 {times} 10{sup 8}{center dot}cm{sup {minus}2}). Dissolution rates of calcite far from equilibrium were observed to depend on surface preparation and surface morphology resulting from defects outcropping at the crystal surface. The high dissolution rate for mechanically polished surfaces is attributed to enhanced dissolution at cracks and dislocation loops produced in the grinding process. The initial dissolution rate for cleaved surfaces depends on the surface morphology, but reaches a reproducible steady state value when a constant bimodal size distribution of intersecting pits with time-independent wall slope is achieved. The two populations of etch pits consist of abundant, short-lived, small etch pits (attributed to nucleation at impurity or point defect clusters) and long-lived, larger point-bottomed pits (attributed to dislocations). Consistent with this interpretation, significant dissolution at an abundance of nondislocation nucleation sites in undeformed calcite explains the relatively small increase in dissolution rate for strained samples. Simulation of bulk crystal dissolution based on etch pit growth rates is in reasonable agreement with observed dissolution rates and surface morphology. Activation energies for pit deepening and widening were measured between 5 and 50C as 27 {plus minus} 5 and 37 {plus minus} 3 kJ mol, respectively.

The aluminum concentration was determined by ion chromatography, while the final equilibrium pH was measured at temperature. The equilibrium quotients for the reaction Al(OH){sub 3} + 3H{sup +} {r reversible} + Al{sup 3+} + 3H{sub 2}O were modeled using both an empirical equation including the Debye-Hueckel term and the Pitzer ion interaction treatment which incorporated the relevant single electrolyte and mixing interaction parameters currently available in the literature.

In general, these new equilibrium quotients differ markedly from results of all but the most recently published solubility studies.

Ten of the 21 buildings that comprise the Medical Center are holdovers from the Fort Boise era, including the 1850s vintage boiler plant and plumbing shop, which previously served as the Idaho territorial jail. Historically, steam for heating, humidification, sterilization, cooking and other uses was generated in a central boiler plant and piped to the various buildings by an underground distribution network. In the early 1980s, the VA began planning to replace the boilers and parts of the piping network that had been in service for nearly 70 years. Because the Medical Center was located near a geothermal water source, it was decided to use the geothermal energy wherever possible. Drilling for the geothermal production well began in August 1983. Testing of the well indicated that it would yield a flow of 1,100 gpm (69 L/s) at 160{degrees}F (71{degrees}C). Engineering calculations indicated that this flow could accommodate all of the space heating and domestic hot water heating needs of the Medical Center. This paper reports that, because the geothermal water supply would consist of a single pump in a single well and because this was a healthcare facility, a backup heat system was required.

Then, potential installed thermal power is estimated at 2,797.46 MW under some conditions for coexistence and coprosperity with bathing. However, some disqualifying factors and the average load factor may reduce this value by 530 MW, which will be yet about five times large than the present thermal energy used of 104.69 Mw.

Alteration assemblages formed in the experiments are dominated by chlorite (after biotite), sericite-zeolite-albite (after K-feldspar and plagioclase), and hematite (after magnetite and pyrite). Reaction of rock and aqueous solution resulted in depletion of {sup 18}O in the solid and enrichment of {sup 18}O in the fluid. The magnitudes of change increase as temperature, time, salt concentration, and surface area increase. The trends in isotopic shifts are directly related to changes in the style and intensity of mineralogic alteration in the granite. The degree of isotope exchange in the experimental systems between granite (minerals) and solutions was computed from the comparison with calculated equilibrium fractionation factors and yield values of less than 5 to 50% exchange. The {delta}{sup 18}O changes of the rocks, minerals, and fluid were observed to follow closely with those expected from a first-order rate law. Based on a simple closed-system model with (W/S) mass ratios between 0.5 and 5, the authors estimate the minimum time required for granite-fluid isotopic equilibration to be roughly 200 years or less for grains 1 cm in radius or smaller (porous-media analog) reacted at 300C, and between 10{sup 4} and 10{sup 5} years for grains ranging from 0.1 to 1 m in radius (fractured-media analog) reacted at 300C.","","","","","","United States","1992-01-01T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: Geochimica et Cosmochimica Acta; (United States); Journal Volume: 56:1","","Medium: X; Size: Pages: 445-466","","","AC05-84OR21400","Journal ID: ISSN 0016-7037; CODEN: GCACA","10.1016/0016-7037(92)90144-8","","2016-05-16T00:00:00Z","5077825","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/5077825","","Geochimica et Cosmochimica Acta; (United States)","","56:1"

By performing the experiments in equilibrium with NiFe alloys, the chemical activities of FeO, Fe{sub 2}O{sub 3}, and Ni{sub O} were monitored in the melt and from knowledge of the thermodynamics of olivine mixing, the activity of MgO was also calculated. This is the first time that the activity of Fe{sub 2}O{sub 3} has been monitored in a natural melt and also the first observations of the variation of a{sub FeO} with oxygen fugacity. Empirical models for the variation of the activities of these components as functions of oxygen fugacity, temperature, and composition are presented and the models for FeO and MgO are shown to be able to predict the olivine composition. The partition coefficients for FeO, MgO, NiO, and MnO for olivine were found to be invariant over more than 9 orders of magnitude in oxygen fugacity. The calcium partition coefficient decreases with increasing f{sub o{sub 2}}, but this is due to the changing olivine composition with oxygen fugacity. Nickel, manganese, and calcium partitioning are functions of composition and temperature, although thermodynamic analysis shows that the temperature variation for NiO and MnO is primarily due to the temperature dependence of the activity coefficients rather than a large enthalpy of the exchange reactions. Empirical predictive models are presented for the partition coefficients of all of the divalent cations.","","","","","","United States","1992-01-01T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: Geochimica et Cosmochimica Acta; (United States); Journal Volume: 56:1","","Medium: X; Size: Pages: 303-318","","","","Journal ID: ISSN 0016-7037; CODEN: GCACA","10.1016/0016-7037(92)90135-6","","2016-05-04T00:00:00Z","5035684","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/5035684","","Geochimica et Cosmochimica Acta; (United States)","","56:1"

It is shown that fractional crystallization or subsolidus interaction of the Harney Peak Granite with the magmatic fluid or a fluid derived from the schist cannot explain the difference between the {delta}{sup 18}O values of the core and perimeter granites. Although some oxygen isotope heterogeneity in the granite could be explained by assimilation of the country rocks, assimilation cannot explain all of the difference between the two granite types. Instead, it is proposed that intrusion of the magma which led to the biotite granites in the core of the pluton at the culmination of regional metamorphism initiated melting of the schists at a depth somewhat greater than the present level of erosion. The melts were emplaced into the overlying schist and differentiated into the many tourmaline-rich granite-pegmatite sills and dikes comprising much of the perimeter of the Harney Peak Granite and its satellite plutons. Alternatively, the different melts may have resulted from melting along an isotopically heterogeneous vertical section of the crust in response to the ascent of a thermal pulse.","","","","","","United States","1992-01-01T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: Geochimica et Cosmochimica Acta; (United States); Journal Volume: 56:1","","Medium: X; Size: Pages: 403-417","","","","Journal ID: ISSN 0016-7037; CODEN: GCACA","10.1016/0016-7037(92)90141-5","","2016-05-16T00:00:00Z","7049698","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/7049698","","Geochimica et Cosmochimica Acta; (United States)","","56:1"

Below 1,300 m, the peak paleotemperatures were about 225-250C, but equilibrium well log temperatures indicate a decrease to 150-210C at present. This hot water pulse sharply increased vitrinite reflectance to levels comparable to those measured in the central part of the system, even though studies of apatite fission-track annealing indicate that the duration of heating was only 10{sup 0}-10{sup 1} yr in M-94, in contrast to 10{sup 3}-10{sup 4} yr in the central part of the system. These data indicate that sedimentary organic matter chemically reacts quickly to temperature increases of about 125C above ambient, even when the high temperature existed for only 10{sup 0}-10{sup 1} yr. The quick change of the vitrinite reflectance geothermometer indicates that thermal maturation reactions can stabilize, after a geologically short period of heating, to a level consistent with peak temperature under moderate to high-temperature diagenesis in open, fluid-rich, geothermal systems. Cerro Prieto is one of the most intensively studied and well-known geothermal systems in the world. Thus, data from Cerro Prieto are a benchmark to compare with the predictions of published thermal maturation models such as those formulated by J. Karweil, N. V. Lopatin, and A. K. Burnham and J.J. Sweeney. These thermal maturation models inaccurately predict duration of heating at Cerro Prieto. The kinetic equations used in these models explicitly allow thermal maturation to continue indefinitely at peak temperature, which does not seem to be the case at Cerro Prieto.","","","","","","United States","1991-12-01T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: AAPG Bulletin (American Association of Petroleum Geologists); (United States); Journal Volume: 75:12","","Medium: X; Size: Pages: 1852-1863","","","","Journal ID: ISSN 0149-1423; CODEN: AABUD","","","2009-12-16T00:00:00Z","5247915","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/5247915","","AAPG Bulletin (American Association of Petroleum Geologists); (United States)","","75:12"

The authors have combined selected aspects of the chemistry of hot spring fluids with constraints imposed by a geologically reasonable assemblage of minerals in the system Na{sub 2}O-K{sub 2}O-CaO-MgO-FeO-Fe{sub 2}O{sub 3}-Al{sub 2}O{sub 3}-SiO{sub 2}-H{sub 2}O-HCl-H{sub 2}S to assess the effect of temperature on the composition of the aqueous phase and the activities of mineral components in plagioclase and epidote solid solutions. Assuming fO{sub 2(g)} and fS{sub 2(g)} controlled by pyrite-pyrrhotite-magnetite equilibria, a constant dissolved Ca concentration, and a dissolved Cl concentration equivalent to that of seawater, increasing temperature from 250 to 400C at 500 bars results in systematic changes in the composition of mineral phases, which in turn constrain pH and the distribution of aqueous species. The model predicts that dissolved concentrations of Fe, SiO{sub 2}, K, H{sub 2}S, and H{sub 2} increase, while Na and pH{sub (25C)} decrease with increasing temperature. That many hot springs vent fluids are characterized by variable degrees of conductive heat loss renders measured temperatures unreliable as indicators of the maximum temperature of subseafloor hydrothermal alteration processes. The implications of this are significant for hot spring fluids which reveal large Cl variations relative to seawater, since likely mechanisms to account for such variability typically require temperatures in excess of those inferred for subseafloor reaction zones by simply correcting measured temperatures for the effects of adiabatic cooling.","","","","","","United States","1991-12-01T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: Geochimica et Cosmochimica Acta; (United States); Journal Volume: 55:12","","Medium: X; Size: Pages: 3559-3580","","","","Journal ID: ISSN 0016-7037; CODEN: GCACA","10.1016/0016-7037(91)90056-B","","2016-04-21T00:00:00Z","5077690","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/5077690","","Geochimica et Cosmochimica Acta; (United States)","","55:12"

Below 300C, pyrite and marcasite form via an FeS precursor. The precursor phase is crystalline, nearly stoichiometric FeS with a solubility product of 10{sup 2.9{plus minus}0.2} (K = a{sub Fe{sup 2+}}a{sub H{sub 2}S}/(a{sub H+}){sup 2}). It reacts progressively to mackinawite, hexagonal pyrrhotite, and/or greigite before forming pyrite or marcasite. In the presence of elemental sulfur, thiosulfate, or polysulfides, the rate of reaction is extremely fast (minutes at 150C). Without these sulfur species and only hydrogen sulfide or bisulfide present, the conversion rate drops significantly (1 h at 300C). In the absence of any aqueous sulfur source, the conversion proceeds at an indetectably slow rate. Because the rate of direct FeS{sub 2} nucleation is insignificant in (slightly) acidic solutions below 300C, most pyrite and marcasite in hydrothermal ores form via the conversion of an FeS precursor.","","","","","","United States","1991-12-01T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: Geochimica et Cosmochimica Acta; (United States); Journal Volume: 55:12","","Medium: X; Size: Pages: 3491-3504","","","","Journal ID: ISSN 0016-7037; CODEN: GCACA","10.1016/0016-7037(91)90050-F","","2016-05-17T00:00:00Z","5035619","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/5035619","","Geochimica et Cosmochimica Acta; (United States)","","55:12"

Active hydrothermal venting was confirmed at TAG, based on elevated concentrations of total dissolved Mn (TDM up to 30 nmol/kg), high CH{sub 4} concentrations (up to 200 nL/L), and elevated nephelometry signals. Plumes of a different composition were identified at 15{degree}N with high CH{sub 4} concentrations (up to 400 nL/L), low total dissolved Mn concentrations (TDM < 1 nmol/kg) and no significant nephelometry signal. The different properties of these tracers and the different tracer ratios can be used to deduce vent fluid characteristics and compare one hydrothermal area to another. TDM/CH{sub 4} and Nephel/CH{sub 4} ratios at TEG are of the same order of magnitude as those observed at other spreading axis hydrothermal fields. At 15{degrees}N, the low TDM/CH{sub 4} ratio provides evidence of fluid circulation into ultrabasic rocks and offers a potentially useful and single method of exploring for hydrothermal activity associated with serpentinization. Mantle degassing through hydrothermal activity associated with serpentinization is an important process with respect to chemical and thermal exchanges between the upper mantle and the ocean. Different ratios of hydrothermal tracers (i.e., TDM/CH{sub 4}) provide a useful framework for identifying subseafloor processes along mid-oceanic ridges.","","","","","","United States","1991-11-01T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: Geochimica et Cosmochimica Acta; (United States); Journal Volume: 55:11","","Medium: X; Size: Pages: 3209-3222","","","","Journal ID: ISSN 0016-7037; CODEN: GCACA","10.1016/0016-7037(91)90484-M","","2016-05-16T00:00:00Z","5247928","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/5247928","","Geochimica et Cosmochimica Acta; (United States)","","55:11"

Such studies do not serve as a basis for consideration of the variation of other major constituents such as Fe{sup 3+}, H{sup +}, and O{sup 2{minus}}. The authors report results of a comprehensive study of all major element compositional variation in biotite using samples from a suite of metapelites ranging from lower garnet to sillimanite + K-feldspar grades. The data show that Fe{sup 3+} remains constant within analytical error while percentages by weight of H{sub 2}O and O decrease and increase, respectively, with increasing metamorphic grade. H{sup +} and O{sup 2{minus}} contents of biotite appear to be highly sensitive to temperature and pressure. Samples from low metamorphic grades contain bulk H{sup +} contents > 4 H{sup +}/formula unit. Excess H{sup +} probably occupies vacancies in the interlayer sites as either H{sub 2}O or H{sub 3}O. These results will have an impact on geoscience disciplines that make assumptions about stoichiometry of hydrous phases. For example, the temperature range of reactions involving the breakdown of hydrous phases with more or less H{sup +} than predicted will change, in some cases dramatically, and any calculations involving water activities must be modified to consider H{sup +} variation. Partitioning of H{sup +} among coexisting hydrous phases ({delta}D studies) may be affected by both amount of H{sup +} and its location and bonding (interlayer H{sub 2}O or H{sub 3}O vs. OH{sup {minus}}). Ar diffusivities calculated for {sup 40}Ar/{sup 39}Ar work will be influenced by the H{sup +} occupancy in the interlayer sites.

The results indicate that the maximum power output, external conductance allocation ratio, and second law efficiency are functions of the number total heat exchanger transfer units (N), and are asymptotic to Bejan's original results as N {yields} O. This asymptote represents a global power output maximum and occurs for either extremely high cycle flow rates or cycle phase change processes in both heat exchangers. The LMTD representation also shows that under optimal conditions, more conductance should be allocated to the low-temperature heat exchanger as N increases.","","","","","","United States","1991-10-01T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: Journal of Engineering for Gas Turbines and Power; (United States); Journal Volume: 113:4","","Medium: X; Size: Pages: 505-510","","","","Journal ID: ISSN 0742-4795; CODEN: JETPE","10.1115/1.2906269","","2016-05-03T00:00:00Z","5126573","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/5126573","","Journal of Engineering for Gas Turbines and Power; (United States)","","113:4"

Thermal features comprise near-neutral pH chloride springs (often boiling), acid sulfate springs and mud pools, and mixed waters, the latter including both bicarbonate-chloride and acid sulfate-chloride springs. Comparison of measured and calculated surface chloride flux (the latter from measured heat flow and reservoir chloride concentrations) indicates that at least half of the deep chloride does not discharge at the surface, but flows laterally to the south at shallow depths, mixing with groundwater. There is chemical and stable isotope evidence from hot springs that cold groundwater also acts as a diluent at shallow levels, and very near the surface steam-heated acid sulfate waters mix with the upflow. Boiling of the deep chloride fluids prior to dilution results in the stabilization of K-feldspar. In contrast, dilution at shallower depths by the steam-heated waters (both CO{sub 2}-rich and acid sulfate) leads to the water compositions initially shifting to K-mica (and interstratified clay) stability, and to kaolinite stability with further dilution and temperature decrease. The composition and distribution of these fluids are consistent with alteration mineralogy and zonation observed in drill core. Although boiling occurs at deeper levels and up to the surface in the upflow zone at Waiotapu, mixing is also common and is the dominant process on the margin and in the near-surface portion of the system.","","","","","","United States","1991-10-01T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: Geochimica et Cosmochimica Acta; (United States); Journal Volume: 55:10","","Medium: X; Size: Pages: 2753-2765","","","","Journal ID: ISSN 0016-7037; CODEN: GCACA","10.1016/0016-7037(91)90442-8","","2016-05-27T00:00:00Z","7117299","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/7117299","","Geochimica et Cosmochimica Acta; (United States)","","55:10"

A one-component steady state formulation is used to illustrate that the quartz geobarometer must be used with caution in mid-ocean ridge systems because the assumptions required by the technique may not be met. The results of this model suggest that there can be measurable mass transfer between wall rock and fluid in the upwelling zone of even vigorously flowing mid-ocean ridge hydrothermal systems. In addition, they attempt to quantify the effect of conductive cooling in the upwelling zone on the accuracy of the quartz geobarometer. The porosity and permeability fields constitute a critical link between the fluid dynamic equations and the equations describing chemical reactions in water-rock systems. They utilize a quasi-steady state approximation to evaluate the changes in porosity over time due to dissolution and precipitation of quartz along the flow path of a mid-ocean ridge hydrothermal system. There is little doubt that many mid-ocean ridge fluids encounter pressure and temperature conditions in which the solubility of quartz reaches a maximum. Their calculations suggest that precipitation of quartz from fluids passing through the solubility maximum within the oceanic crust may decrease the local porosity on a time scale of decades.","","","","","","United States","1991-09-01T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: Geochimica et Cosmochimica Acta; (United States); Journal Volume: 55:9","","Medium: X; Size: Pages: 2467-2481","","","","Journal ID: ISSN 0016-7037; CODEN: GCACA","10.1016/0016-7037(91)90366-D","","2016-05-16T00:00:00Z","5035620","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/5035620","","Geochimica et Cosmochimica Acta; (United States)","","55:9"

The Travertine Hot Springs area is on the northern edge of what many consider to be one of the most tectonically active areas in the United States. There is abundant geothermal and seismic activity. The landscape is dotted with volcanic features- cones, craters, domes, flows, fumaroles and hot springs-indicators of unrest in the present as well as reminders of activity in the past. Travertine, also known as calcareous sinter, is limestone formed by chemical precipitation of calcium carbonate (CaCO{sub 3}) from ground or surface waters. It forms stalactites and stalagmites in caves, fills some veins and spring conduits and can also be found at the mouths of springs, especially hot springs. The less compact variety is called tufa and the dense, banded variety is known as Mexican onyx, or onyx marble. True onyx, however, is a banded silicate.","","","","","","United States","1991-08-01T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: California Geology (California Division of Mines and Geology); (United States); Journal Volume: 44:8","","Medium: X; Size: Pages: 171-179,182","","","","Journal ID: ISSN 0026-4555; CODEN: CGEOA","","","2009-12-16T00:00:00Z","5783429","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/5783429","","California Geology (California Division of Mines and Geology); (United States)","","44:8"

These investigations of the northernmost section of the Cleft segment have discovered: (1) semicontinuous low-temperature venting and one major high-temperature vent site along 17 km of the neovolcanic zone and (2) very glassy, lightly sedimented sheet flows and pillow mounds superimposed on older terrain over about 24 km along the northern-most part. The pillow mounds are documented to have erupted between 1981 and 1987. The occurrence of the megaplumes during this same time period strengthens the hypothesis that megaplumes are caused by sea-floor extension events. Although the basalts from the entire length of the neovolcanic zone of the Cleft segment appear to have been derived from the same mantle source, a systematic northward increase in Mg number along the segment within the neovolcanic zone indicates less shallow-level differentiation to the north, possibly related to the development of new magma chambers during the recent phase of sea-floor spreading that has occurred there.","","","","","","United States","1991-08-01T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: Geology; (United States); Journal Volume: 19:8","","Medium: X; Size: Pages: 771-775","","","","Journal ID: ISSN 0091-7613; CODEN: GLGYB","10.1130/0091-7613(1991)019<0771:GOTNCS>2.3.CO;2","","2016-05-16T00:00:00Z","5877503","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/5877503","","Geology; (United States)","","19:8"

Standard-state entropies, heat capacities, and volumes are either derived from experimental studies or estimated following HELGESON et al. (1978). The derived thermodynamic properties are internally consistent and consistent with the thermodynamic properties of minerals and aqueous species from BERMAN (1988,1990), SVERJENSKY et al. (1991a), SHOCK and HELGESON (1988), and SHOCK et al. (1989), and therefore can be extrapolated over a wide range of temperatures and pressures for application to geochemistry, igneous and metamorphic petrology, and ore deposits. The derived standard-state thermodynamic properties for F and Cl endmember phases provide a basis for predicting the fluoride and chloride concentrations of former aqueous fluids from the measured F and Cl concentrations in minerals. Speciation and solubility calculations simulating F and Cl partitioning between minerals and hydrothermal fluids, and systems containing apatites, show that the partitioning is a strong function of temperature, pressure, and fluid composition. The decrease of both pressure and pH of fluids favors partitioning of Cl into annite with respect to fluids. In addition to predicting fluoride and chloride concentrations in hydrothermal fluids, the results of this study enable mass transfer calculations including both F-Cl-OH partitioning and metal complexing of halides during water-rock interactions in a variety of geological systems.","","","","","","United States","1991-07-01T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: Geochimica et Cosmochimica Acta; (United States); Journal Volume: 55:7","","Medium: X; Size: Pages: 1837-1858","","","","Journal ID: ISSN 0016-7037; CODEN: GCACA","","","2009-12-16T00:00:00Z","5780223","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/5780223","","Geochimica et Cosmochimica Acta; (United States)","","55:7"

This paper presents some results of geothermal studies using TETRAD, a multipurpose simulation that can run on a PC. The code was first benchmarked against a number of other geothermal simulators to demonstrate the accuracy of the solutions obtained. Once validated, TETRAD has been used in a number of studies of interest to the geothermal industry.

The paper then reviews how the potential might be developed, discussing preference of possible sites, and cost of the developments at todays prices. Cost of geothermal electric power generation with comparative costs for hydro generation are given. Possible transmission system developments to feed the power to the proposed HVDC Link converter stations are also discussed.","","","","","","United States","1991-06-01T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: IEEE Transactions on Energy Conversion (Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers); (United States); Journal Volume: 6:2","","Medium: X; Size: Pages: 289-296","","","","Journal ID: ISSN 0885-8969; CODEN: ITCNE","10.1109/60.79635","","2016-05-18T00:00:00Z","5646975","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/5646975","","IEEE Transactions on Energy Conversion (Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers); (United States)","","6:2"

One-dimensional quasi-steady flows have the remarkable property that volumetric flux is essentially independent of position and is a function of time alone. Such volumetric fluxes are (to within an additive constant) inversely proportional to the spatial mean value of flowing viscosity. Consequently, the evolution of such a system is controlled by global properties of viscosity. Vertical two0phase quasi-steady flows evolving from an initial steady flow to another final steady flow are analyzed, and the corresponding theory is matched to output from a numerical simulator. Good agreement between the theory and simulator is demonstrated for simple shocks and expansion waves.","","","","","","United States","1991-06-01T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: Water Resources Research; (United States); Journal Volume: 27:6","","Medium: X; Size: Pages: 1207-1214","","","","Journal ID: ISSN 0043-1397; CODEN: WRERA","10.1029/91WR00306","","2016-05-18T00:00:00Z","5915413","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/5915413","","Water Resources Research; (United States)","","27:6"

The high {delta}{sup 11}B values of the Dead Sea brines (55.7 to 57.4{per thousand} versus NBS-951) and the hot springs (52.2 to 55.7{per thousand}), and low B/Li ratios (2.0 to 2.3 and 2.5 to 2.7, respectively), relative to seawater, indicate preferential removal of {sup 10}B from the brines and hence boron adsorption onto clay minerals. The brackish 'En Feshcha springs and the freshwater 'En Dawid and Nahal Arugot springs yield lower B contents and {delta}{sup 11}B values (37.7 to 40.6{per thousand} and 33.8 to 36.9{per thousand}, respectively). The {delta}{sup 11}B values and B contents of diluted Dead Sea brines lie on calculated mixing lines between the composition of the brackish and freshwater springs with the composition of the Dead Sea. The {delta}{sup 11}B values of the hot springs, however, given their boron content, are significantly lower than those of the mixing lines. Thus, waters from the hot springs cannot be a mixing product of the Dead Sea brine with freshwater. Instead, the Dead Sea brine has evolved from the brines of the hot springs through further isotopic fractionation and boron adsorption onto detrital sediments.","","","","","","United States","1991-06-01T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: Geochimica et Cosmochimica Acta; (United States); Journal Volume: 55:6","","Medium: X; Size: Pages: 1689-1695","","","","Journal ID: ISSN 0016-7037; CODEN: GCACA","10.1016/0016-7037(91)90139-V","","2016-05-13T00:00:00Z","6083288","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/6083288","","Geochimica et Cosmochimica Acta; (United States)","","55:6"

The hydrothermal mineral fluorite (CaF{sub 2}) displays large variations in rare earth element (REE) abundance and samarium/neodymium ratios within a single vein. Samarium-neodymium dating of fluorite from the classic granite-hosted tin deposits of southwest England demonstrates its use as a precise chronometer of mineralization. The concentrations of light rare earth elements (LREEs) in the fluorites are highly variable and suggest the coeval precipitation of an LREE-rich phase as the most likely cause of the extreme variation in samarium/neodymium ratios.","","","","","","United States","1991-05-17T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: Science (Washington, D.C.); (United States); Journal Volume: 252:5008","","Medium: X; Size: Pages: 949-952","","","","Journal ID: ISSN 0036-8075; CODEN: SCIEA","10.1126/science.252.5008.949","","2016-05-23T00:00:00Z","6033653","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/6033653","","Science (Washington, D.C.); (United States)","","252:5008"

In order to determine the mechanisms of fluid flow through the area, the authors made a detailed study of the {delta}{sup 18}O values of quartz from an outcrop of interlayered quartzites and schists. Results indicate that the permeability of the quartzite was very low in comparison to that of the schist. The {delta}{sup 18}O{sub qtz} values from schist layers are remarkably homogeneous (15.5-15.8), in contrast to the {delta}{sup 18}O{sub qtz} values of schist units outside of the hot spot, which vary widely. Quartz veins that cut the quartzites and pinch out in the schists have the same {delta}{sup 18}O values (15.7) as quartz from the schists. In the quartzites, {delta}{sup 18}O{sub qtz} values immediately adjacent to the veins and schists are similar to those in the veins and schists, but decrease by {approximately}1 permil in the centers of the layer. The authors interpret these results to indicate that fluid flow in the hot spot was mainly through the schists and fractures in the quartzites. The oxygen isotope exchange fronts in the quartzites prove that there was some flow from the schists and the fractures into the quartzites. Comparisons of the shapes of these exchange fronts with exchange fronts predicted by two different models of fluid flow in rocks indicate that fluid transport in the quartzite was predominantly by advection and that the kinetic rates of isotope exchange were fast relative to the advective velocity of the fluid infiltrating the system. Considering the slow rate of oxygen isotope exchange between quartz and a fluid, this implies that fluid flow from the schist and vein fracture into the quartzite was extremely limited.","","","","","","United States","1991-05-01T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: Geophysical Research Letters (American Geophysical Union); (United States); Journal Volume: 18:5","","Medium: X; Size: Pages: 959-962","","","","Journal ID: ISSN 0094-8276; CODEN: GPRLA","10.1029/91GL00911","","2016-05-25T00:00:00Z","5662754","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/5662754","","Geophysical Research Letters (American Geophysical Union); (United States)","","18:5"

All experiments were run at 1,000 bars (100 MPa) water pressure except those designed to measure water pressure dependence, which ranged from 200 to 2,000 bars. The Arrhenius relations obtained for layer-parallel diffusive transport in the three micas by bulk exchange experiments. The results of ion microprobe (SIMS) depth profiling perpendicular to the layers (parallel to c-axis) yield diffusion coefficients 3 to 4 orders of magnitude lower than for transport parallel to the layers. A single layer-parallel step profiling experiment yields a diffusion coefficient identical, within uncertainty, to those obtained from bulk exchange experiments. A slight dependence of diffusion rate on water pressure may obtain in phlogopite; however, the difference is approximately within the uncertainty of the measurement. Diffusion rates are similar, within about a half an order of magnitude, for a range of biotite composition from annite{sub 4} to annite{sub 63}, as well as for muscovite. Comparison of oxygen diffusion rates in biotite from this study with Ar, K, and Rb diffusion from published data supports the idea that water is the oxygen-bearing species in hydrothermal diffusion experiments. The implication of these results for natural systems is that the micas, especially biotite, will continue to exchange oxygen isotopes via volume diffusion down to temperatures as low as 300C. The rapid diffusion kinetics may explain biotite oxygen isotope disequilibrium, which is commonly observed even in rocks where other mineral phases preserve equilibrium compositions.","","","","","","United States","1991-05-01T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: Geochimica et Cosmochimica Acta; (United States); Journal Volume: 55:5","","Medium: X; Size: Pages: 1319-1330","","","","Journal ID: ISSN 0016-7037; CODEN: GCACA","10.1016/0016-7037(91)90310-2","","2016-05-24T00:00:00Z","6033432","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/6033432","","Geochimica et Cosmochimica Acta; (United States)","","55:5"

Quist, Marshall, and their coworkers interpreted their high temperature/pressure conductance data in part by considering the activity coefficients of the neutral species to be negligibly different from unity in dilute solutions. However, these data can also be interpreted by regarding the logarithm of the activity coefficients of neutral complexes ({bar {gamma}}{sub n}) to be a linear function of the effective ionic strength ({bar I}). Accordingly, supercritical conductance data for five electrolytes were regressed in the present study using the Hueckel (1925), Setchenow (1892), and Shedlovsky (1938) equations, together with the law of mass action and values of the limiting equivalent conductances of the electrolytes taken from Oelkers and Helgeson (1989) for the temperatures and pressures of the experiments to generate simultaneously the logarithms of dissociation constants (log K{sub 1}) and Setchenow coefficients (b{sub {gamma},n}) for neutral 1:1 complexes. The resulting values of log K{sub 1} are in close agreement with corresponding values originally reported by Marshall and coworkers. However, the regression calculation indicate that b{sub {gamma},n} and thus the activity coefficients of neutral species in concentrated electrolyte solutions increase dramatically with increasing temperature and decreasing pressure, which opposes the effect on ion pair formation of the accompanying decrease in log K{sub 1}.","","","","","","United States","1991-05-01T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: Geochimica et Cosmochimica Acta; (United States); Journal Volume: 55:5","","Medium: X; Size: Pages: 1235-1251","","","","Journal ID: ISSN 0016-7037; CODEN: GCACA","10.1016/0016-7037(91)90303-M","","2016-05-19T00:00:00Z","6033503","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/6033503","","Geochimica et Cosmochimica Acta; (United States)","","55:5"

The geometry of isotopic exchange fronts developed in a rock sequence depends on the interplay between these first three parameters. The change in isotopic ratio in a rock depends on its position in the flowpath and the rate of isotopic exchange with the fluid in addition to the cumulative fluid flux. Thus conventional water/rock (W/R) ratios will also depend on position in flow paths. Absence of significant {sup 18}O depletions in rock sequences does not require low W/R ratios, but may only mean that the rock is in a rock-dominated segment of a flowpath or alternatively that fluid infiltration was characterized by non-equilibrium exchange.","","","","","","United States","1991-05-01T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: Geophysical Research Letters (American Geophysical Union); (United States); Journal Volume: 18:5","","Medium: X; Size: Pages: 971-974","","","","Journal ID: ISSN 0094-8276; CODEN: GPRLA","10.1029/91GL01079","","2016-05-19T00:00:00Z","5536595","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/5536595","","Geophysical Research Letters (American Geophysical Union); (United States)","","18:5"

Chemical sealing by deposition of minerals in veins appears to have allowed the development of the high P{sub f} encountered in the above wells. The upper limit for the magnitude of P{sub f} that can be attained is controlled by either the onset of shear fracturing (where differential stress is relatively high) that reopens clogged veins, or the hydraulic opening of new or old fractures (at relatively low values of differential stress). The brittle-plastic transition for silicic rocks can occur at temperatures as high as 370-400C in tectonically active regions. In regions where high-temperature geothermal systems develop and persist, it appears that either strain rates commonly are in the range 10{sup {minus}12} to 10{sup {minus}13}, or that silicic rocks in the shallow crust generally behave rheologically more like wet quartz diorite than wet Westerly granite.","","","","","","United States","1991-05-01T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: Geophysical Research Letters (American Geophysical Union); (United States); Journal Volume: 18:5","","Medium: X; Size: Pages: 955-958","","","","Journal ID: ISSN 0094-8276; CODEN: GPRLA","","","2009-12-16T00:00:00Z","5462776","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/5462776","","Geophysical Research Letters (American Geophysical Union); (United States)","","18:5"

Two magnetometers are located inside the caldera with a third reference magnetometer located 26 km southeast of the caldera. After correction for secular variation, it is apparent that an anomalous 2 nT decrease in the magnetic field occurred from mid-1989 to mid-1990 at the magnetometer located closest to the center of the resurgent dome inside the caldera. During this period a significant increase in geodetic strain rate of 8.5 ppm/yr was observed on the two-color geodimeter network within the caldera from October, 1989, to mid-1990 and a dramatic increase in seismic activity occurred from December, 1989 to July, 1990. A simple dilatational point-source model with pressure increasing by 52 Mpa from October 1989 to August 1990 at a depth of about 7 km beneath the center of the resurgent dome can be fit to the strain data. If this same model is used to calculate piezomagnetic fields in the caldera, the results obtained agree with the observed local magnetic field data provided the Curie point isotherm is at a depth of {le}5 km. Taken together, these magnetic, seismic and geodetic data suggest that an episode of active magmatic intrusion occurred from late 1989 to mid-1990 at a depth of about 7-8 km beneath the resurgent dome within the Long Valley caldera. Other indications of this intrusion should be evident in measurements of leveling, local gravity, and seismic imaging data.","","","","","","United States","1991-04-01T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: Geophysical Research Letters (American Geophysical Union); (United States); Journal Volume: 18:4","","Medium: X; Size: Pages: 601-604","","","","Journal ID: ISSN 0094-8276; CODEN: GPRLA","10.1029/91GL00814","","2016-05-16T00:00:00Z","5462788","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/5462788","","Geophysical Research Letters (American Geophysical Union); (United States)","","18:4"

The objective of the scientific team from France, Germany, and Tonga was to understand the process of sea-floor ore formation associated with hydrothermal circulation along the Valu Fa back-arc ridge behind the Tonga-Kermadec trench. The four diving areas, between lat21{degree}25'S and 22{degree}40'S in water{approximately}2000 m deep, were selected on the basis of results from cruises of the R/V Jean Charcot and R/V Sonne. The Nadir cruise provided proof of hydrothermal activity-in all for areas, over more than 100 km-as indicated by the widespread occurence of hydrothermal deposits and by heat flow, conductivity, and temperature measurements near the sea bottom. The most spectacular findings were high-temperature white and black smokers and associated fauna and ore deposits. Hydrothermal water chemistry and sulfide composition data presented here indicate that this hydrothermal field is very different from the hydrothermal fields in oceanic ridges. This difference is seen in water chemistry of the hydrothermal fluid (pH=2 and high metal content) and the chemical composition of sulfides (enrichment in Ba, As, and Pb).","","","","","","United States","1991-04-01T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: Geology; (USA); Journal Volume: 19:4","","Medium: X; Size: Pages: 303-306","","","","Journal ID: ISSN 0091-7613; CODEN: GLGYB","10.1130/0091-7613(1991)019<0303:HAITLB>2.3.CO;2","","2016-04-14T00:00:00Z","5627351","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/5627351","","Geology; (USA)","","19:4"

The temperature dependence of the T-O bond length and T-O-T angle in the melt has been calculated for albite, anorthite, nepheline, and MgAl{sub 2}Si{sub 2}O{sub 8} (a magnesium analog of anorthite) at their experimental melt densities at atmospheric pressure and for pure silica at two different densities corresponding to V/V{sub 0} = 1.0 (1atm) and V/V{sub 0} = 0.8 ({approximately}4 GPa). These simulations show that melt fragility can be correlated to increasing T-O length and decreasing T-O-T angle, both of which are characteristics of silicate melts under increasing pressure. Framework cations with coordination numbers greater than four are observed in these aluminosilicate melts and are shown to be related to fragile behavior. Finally, for nepheline and anorthite we infer a large contribution to fragility from configurational disordering of Al-O-Si links which are known to be dominant in the glasses but are found to be absent from the simulated melts.","","","","","","United States","1991-03-01T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: Geochimica et Cosmochimica Acta; (United States); Journal Volume: 55:3","","Medium: X; Size: Pages: 721-730","","","","Journal ID: ISSN 0016-7037; CODEN: GCACA","10.1016/0016-7037(91)90336-4","","2016-05-23T00:00:00Z","6033465","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/6033465","","Geochimica et Cosmochimica Acta; (United States)","","55:3"

Near the target seismic reflector at the base of the well, an active hydrothermal system was encountered in which heat flow of up to 90 mW/m{sup 2} was found in a mineralized zone beneath a volcanic sill or flow. The heat flow then dropped to 50 mW/m{sub 2} beneath this subhorizontal flow zone. The mining of heat from downdip is proposed to account for this thermal anomaly, as well as the scatter in the heat flow determined from the few other wells drilled into Puerto Rico. The time-temperature history of the well indicates that Eocene volcaniclastics of the lower 2 km were deposited into a geothermal gradient of 60C/km north of an active arc (heat flow estimated to have been 120-180 mW/m{sup 2}). Uplift, erosion and cooling occurred between 40 and 30 Ma. Reburial and deposition of Oligocene-Miocene Limestones produced the present-day geothermal gradient of 15C/km (heat flow of 30-50 mW/m{sup 2}).

Interestingly, heat transport rates in the unicellular regime are essentially conductive, so such flow, unlike more vigorous flow at higher Rayleigh number, is not properly termed convective. These principles have numerous geological ramifications, including: (1) many of the hydrothermal systems developed around epizonal intrusions should be dominantly unicellular in nature, which explains their aspect ratios and the smooth and very regular {delta}{sup 18}O variations that are produced in the rocks; (2) large, long-lived unicells are predicted to occur deep in the Earth's crust wherever Rayleigh numbers are finite and isotherms are substantially inclined, as in zones of batholith intrusion, regional metamorphism, and collision; (3) unicells with lateral dimensions of several hundred kilometers are predicted to be associated with subduction zones dipping more than 6-12{degree}, with fluid advection into the hot mantle wedge being instrumental in mantle metasomatism and in the generation of andesitic magmas.","","","","","","United States","1991-02-01T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: Geophysical Research Letters (American Geophysical Union); (United States); Journal Volume: 18:2","","Medium: X; Size: Pages: 199-202","","","","Journal ID: ISSN 0094-8276; CODEN: GPRLA","10.1029/91GL00216","","2016-04-11T00:00:00Z","5426350","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/5426350","","Geophysical Research Letters (American Geophysical Union); (United States)","","18:2"

The fluids were liberated in devolatilizing, relatively low-temperature (400{degrees} to 600{degrees}C) parts of the subduction zone, primarily by chlorite-breakdown reactions. An evaluation of pertinent phase equilibria indicates that chlorite in mafic and sediment rocks and melange may stabilize a large volatile component to great depths (perhaps >100 kilometers), depending on the thermal structure of the subduction zone.

Good initial estimates are of paramount importance to a successful implementation of any iteration scheme specially those that are Newton based. There is an observed pattern of dependence of the adjoint variables and the system state as described by power demands and water availability. Finding such relationships is useful for generation planning activities as well as in providing initial guesses in the numerical solution of the problem. This paper proposes statistical models for predicting the incremental cost function {lambda} and the water conversion factor {nu} usually encountered in the hydro-thermal power system optimization problem. The method treats the active power demand and the volume of water available as the independent variables. The Least squares and the iteratively reweighted Least squares procedures are used to estimate model parameters. The approach treats the power system as a variable head hydro-thermal system, Kron's loss formula is used to characterize the system performance and losses. Results for an example using a 4 plant network are presented in order to demonstrate the applicability of this approach.","","","","","","United States","1991-01-01T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: Electric Machines and Power System; (United States); Journal Volume: 19:3","","Medium: X; Size: Pages: 271-286","","","","Journal ID: ISSN 0731-356X; CODEN: EMPSD","10.1080/07313569108909523","","2016-05-25T00:00:00Z","5359098","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/5359098","","Electric Machines and Power System; (United States)","","19:3"

Pacific) contain positive anomalous concentrations of dissolved inorganic nutrients compared to adjacent oceanic and lagoonal waters. These anomalies have been interpreted by geothermal circulation of deep oceanic waters penetrating the porous reef carbonates and ascending through the atoll flanks by thermo-convective advection as already proposed for other atolls. The authors present here a new strong evidence of this geothermal circulation inside atoll reefs from the record of helium-3 anomalies in borehole waters of Tikehau atoll. These results bear directly on three controversial aspects of reef history: the efficiency of thermal energy for circulation of reef pore waters, the sources of nutrients to support the net productivity of reef ecosystems, the early diagenesis of reef foundation carbonates.","","","","","","United States","1991-01-01T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: Geophysical Research Letters (American Geophysical Union); (USA); Journal Volume: 18:1","","Medium: X; Size: Pages: 109-112","","","","Journal ID: ISSN 0094-8276; CODEN: GPRLA","10.1029/90GL02720","","2016-05-12T00:00:00Z","5708345","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/5708345","","Geophysical Research Letters (American Geophysical Union); (USA)","","18:1"

This technique allowed them to catch the first steps of the {alpha} {yields} {beta} transformation in Mg{sub 2}SiO{sub 4}. A TEM study of the run products showed that a structurally disordered phase is an intermediate of the reaction. The oxygen sublattice of this intermediate phase is well ordered, but a very large density of planar faults on (010) planes destroys the long range order in the cation sublattices. A two-steps mechanism for the {alpha} {yields} {beta} transformation is therefore probable, involving first the nucleation of the structurally disordered phase, then the ordering of this phase.

We have selected plagioclase because of the wealth of volcanic and experimental data, the compositional simplicity of plagioclase, and its relevance to many petrological problems. We begin our study by examining experimental data on Sr partitioning between plagioclase and hydrothermal solutions in an attempt to constrain the role of crystal chemistry. We establish a simple thermodynamic model for trace element partitioning between plagioclase and hydrothermal solutions. This treatment is then extended to the plagioclase-melt system using available data from both experimental and volcanic systems in order to derive a general equation for Sr and Ba partitioning.

Deep dipole-dipole geoelectrical soundings have also been performed along two profiles perpendicular to the strike of the graben. The geological interpretation of the geophysical data allows us to conclude that no shallow, exploitable, geothermal reservoir exists in the survey area.","","","","","","United States","1991-01-01T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: Geothermics (International Journal of Geothermal Research and its Applications); (United States); Journal Volume: 20:5","","Medium: X; Size: Pages: 147-164","","","","Journal ID: ISSN 0375-6505; CODEN: GTMCA","10.1016/0375-6505(91)90012-K","","2016-04-20T00:00:00Z","7239591","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/7239591","","Geothermics (International Journal of Geothermal Research and its Applications); (United States)","","20:5"

Ten to twenty l/s of the thermal flow are of an Na-Cl component from a deep source, which was identified by means of the B, Cl, Cs, Na, and Li contents of the waters. The Canino Na-Cl fluids have ratios among these species close to those of the geothermal fluids of Latera. The Canino hydrothermal system, which is located within buried carbonate structures, is therefore made up of a shallower zone, where the Ca-SO{sub 4} hydrotype is prevalent, and another deeper zone where an Na-Cl brine is present. For the sulphate fluids circulating in the upper levels of the system, a temperature of 70-100{degrees} C has been estimated, while a possible higher enthalpy resource may be represented by the chloride aqueous solutions circulating at deeper levels.","","","","","","United States","1991-01-01T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: Geothermics (International Journal of Geothermal Research and its Applications); (United States); Journal Volume: 20:5","","Medium: X; Size: Pages: 329-342","","","","Journal ID: ISSN 0375-6505; CODEN: GTMCA","10.1016/0375-6505(91)90024-P","","2016-04-11T00:00:00Z","7239592","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/7239592","","Geothermics (International Journal of Geothermal Research and its Applications); (United States)","","20:5"

According to out interpretation, the steam produced in areas affected by induced recharge is a mixture of two components (steam from recharge water and original deep steam). The natural recharge increased and recharge became an important phenomenon as a consequence of the pressure drawdown caused by exploitation. Three separate estimates of the water recharge give similar results and confirm that a significant fraction of the produced steam derives from recharge water.","","","","","","United States","1991-01-01T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: Geothermics (International Journal of Geothermal Research and its Applications); (United States); Journal Volume: 20:5","","Medium: X; Size: Pages: 119-134","","","","Journal ID: ISSN 0375-6505; CODEN: GTMCA","10.1016/0375-6505(91)90010-S","","2016-04-13T00:00:00Z","7066258","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/7066258","","Geothermics (International Journal of Geothermal Research and its Applications); (United States)","","20:5"

Although the task is far from complete, two areas have been examined in some detail; the recent volcanic complex of Meager Mountain, British Columbia, and the Western Platform in British Columbia, Alberta and Saskatchewan. It has been found that there are substantial resources associated with both, but of different character. At Meager Mountain high-temperature water will probably eventually be used for the generation of electrical power, whereas the low- to medium-temperature resources of the Basin are suitable for space heating and direct use. The useful accessible resource base in the waters of the Western Platform is very large, and reserves, estimated at 1% of the resource base are an order of magnitude greater than the thermal equivalent of Canadian oil reserves. In eastern Canada, where conventional energy supplies are more expensive, prospects for geothermal resources are not generally favorable, except in small areas. Development of geothermal resources in Canada is hindered by the absence of an established industry and, except in the Province of British Columbia, of legislation for the control of exploration and development of geothermal resources.","","","","","","United States","1991-01-01T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Volume: 20:5","","Medium: X; Size: Pages: 369-386","","","","Journal ID: ISSN 0375-6505; CODEN: GTMCA","10.1016/0375-6505(91)90027-S","","2016-04-28T00:00:00Z","7066266","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/7066266","","","","20:5"

The power plant currently generates at approximately 50 per cent of its total installed capacity of 95 MW{sub c} because of a substantial reservoir pressure drawdown and limited drilling of make-up wells. The focus of this study is to develop means for increasing the power production over the next 30 years. One possible option is to devise an injection scheme to decrease the pressure decline and increase the energy recovery from the reservoir. Another possibility is to drill step-out wells to increase the size of the wellfield. A three-dimensional numerical model of the field has been developed to determine the effects of injection and expanded fluid production. The model was used to predict the responses of the existing and proposed production wells for different levels of electrical power generation. The overall reservoir response to different exploitation and injection scenarios was also investigated. The model predicts that the geothermal system can provide steam to generate 90 MW{sub c} for no more than 20 y, even with reinjection and a large-scale drilling program. The results also indicate that the system can produce about 75 MW{sub c} for a 30-y period with significant reinjection and the drilling of about 20 new production wells.","","","","","","United States","1991-01-01T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: Geothermics (International Journal of Geothermal Research and its Applications); (United States); Journal Volume: 20:5","","Medium: X; Size: Pages: 181-196","","","","Journal ID: ISSN 0375-6505; CODEN: GTMCA","10.1016/0375-6505(91)90031-P","","2016-05-23T00:00:00Z","7117306","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/7117306","","Geothermics (International Journal of Geothermal Research and its Applications); (United States)","","20:5"

Six water-points, with temperatures ranging between 20 and 47{degrees} C and different chemical and isotopic compositions, are found close to the margins of outcrops of the main regional aquifer formation. Systematic hydrogeological, geochemical and isotopic observations and temperature measurements were carried out on the different springs and wells for a period of three years (1984-1986). Constant water characteristics with time were observed in four water-points; two wells had variable trends depending on mixing processes. A groundwater circulation model characterized by flowpaths of different length and depth is suggested by the variety of chemical and isotopic characteristics and is consistent with geothermometry, which indicates temperatures up to 25{degrees} C higher than those measured at the spring emergencies. An important water supply to the system comes from local recharge, although regional circulation may also be present, particularly in the eastern part of the investigated area.","","","","","","United States","1991-01-01T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: Geothermics (International Journal of Geothermal Research and its Applications); (United States); Journal Volume: 20:5","","Medium: X; Size: Pages: 67-82","","","","Journal ID: ISSN 0375-6505; CODEN: GTMCA","10.1016/0375-6505(91)90006-H","","2016-04-26T00:00:00Z","7117314","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/7117314","","Geothermics (International Journal of Geothermal Research and its Applications); (United States)","","20:5"

In mid-1987 the total installed capacity at Cerro Prieto reached 620 MW{sub c}, requiring a large rate of fluid production (more than 10,500 tonnes/hr of a brine-steam mixture; August 1988). This significant mass extraction has led to changes in reservoir thermodynamic conditions and in the chemistry of the produced fluids. Pressure drawdown has caused an increase in cold water recharge in the southern and western edges of the field, and local and general reservoir boiling in parts of the geothermal system. In this paper, after reviewing the hydrogeologic and geochemical models of Cerro Prieto, the exploitation-induced cold water recharge and reservoir boiling (and plugging) observed in different areas of the field, are discussed and interpreted on the basis of these models and schematic flow models that describe the hydrogeology.","","","","","","United States","1991-01-01T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: Geothermics (International Journal of Geothermal Research and its Applications); (United States); Journal Volume: 20:5","","Medium: X; Size: Pages: 39-52","","","","Journal ID: ISSN 0375-6505; CODEN: GTMCA","10.1016/0375-6505(91)90004-F","","2016-05-27T00:00:00Z","7309592","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/7309592","","Geothermics (International Journal of Geothermal Research and its Applications); (United States)","","20:5"

Four major lithologic units are present in Ahuachapan and three major aquifers have been identified; flow patterns and zones of fluid mixing were located on the basis of temperature and geochemical data from wells and surface manifestations. Geologic structures control the heat and fluid recharge and the flow within the reservoir. Modeling studies suggest, in agreement with field data, an overall average transmissivity of 25-35 Darcy-meters, and indicate that the system is recharged by waters with temperatures greater than 250{degrees} C. The total thermal throughflow for the Ahuachapan reservoir in the unexploited state is estimated to be about 250 MW{sub t}.","","","","","","United States","1991-01-01T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: Geothermics (International Journal of Geothermal Research and its Applications); (United States); Journal Volume: 20:5","","Medium: X; Size: Pages: 1-22","","","","Journal ID: ISSN 0375-6505; CODEN: GTMCA","10.1016/0375-6505(91)90002-D","","2016-05-13T00:00:00Z","7309597","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/7309597","","Geothermics (International Journal of Geothermal Research and its Applications); (United States)","","20:5"

The areal distribution of the geothermal gradient across the sediments shows a regional-scale northerly increase, with intermediate- and local-state features correlating with anomalies in heat generation at the top of the basement. Only in the northeast and southeast corners of the basin can high geothermal gradients not be explained by heat generation; there they may be caused by convective fluid flow effects. The temperature distribution at the base of the sediments is highly correlated with the thickness of the sedimentary cover and reflects major topographic and basement features. Overall, the characteristics of the geothermal regime in the Western Canada Sedimentary Basin are indicative of a conduction dominated system.","","","","","","United States","1991-01-01T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: Geothermics (International Journal of Geothermal Research and its Applications); (United States); Journal Volume: 20:5","","Medium: X; Size: Pages: 387-408","","","","Journal ID: ISSN 0375-6505; CODEN: GTMCA","10.1016/0375-6505(91)90028-T","","2016-05-16T00:00:00Z","7309598","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/7309598","","Geothermics (International Journal of Geothermal Research and its Applications); (United States)","","20:5"

Drawdown of up to 15 bars and significant temperature changes have been observed in the wellfield. Temperatures have declined due to boiling in the reservoir in response to the pressure drawdown; localized and minor cooling due to reinjection of spent geothermal fluids have also been observed. There are indications of cold fluid influx deep into the reservoir from the west and north. Reservoir temperatures show that a significant amount of hot fluid recharge comes to the wellfield from the southeast, and temperatures also indicate that the recharge rate has increased with time as pressure declines in the reservoir. Chemical analyses of the produced fluids show that most wells are fed by a mixture of geothermal fluids and cooler, less-saline waters. The cold water inflow has increased due to exploitation, as demonstrated by decreased salinity of the produced fluids.","","","","","","United States","1991-01-01T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: Geothermics (International Journal of Geothermal Research and its Applications); (United States); Journal Volume: 20:5","","Medium: X; Size: Pages: 23-38","","","","Journal ID: ISSN 0375-6505; CODEN: GTMCA","10.1016/0375-6505(91)90003-E","","2016-05-02T00:00:00Z","7239574","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/7239574","","Geothermics (International Journal of Geothermal Research and its Applications); (United States)","","20:5"

At constant temperature and pressure, measured pH (25{degree}C) systematically decreases upon increasing the Mg/Cl ratio of the solution, consistent with buffering of {alpha}{sub Mg{sup 2+}}/{alpha}{sup 2}{sub H{sup +}} by talc-quartz equilibria. Measured quartz solubilities increase with increasing concentration of total dissolved salts (NaCl + MgCl{sub 2}), suggesting a salting-in behavior for aqueous SiO{sub 2} at these conditions. A thermodynamic analysis of talc-quartz-solution equilibria in the Na{sub 2}O-MgO-SiO{sub 2}-H{sub 2}O-HCl system indicates that ion-pairing between Mg{sup 2+} and Cl{sup {minus}} is necessary to account for our measured talc solubilities. The retrieval of thermodynamic data for Mg minerals from solubility measurements in chloride solutions must, therefore, take into account MgCl{sup +} explicitly. The authors apply results to the stability of caminite, an important constituents of hydrothermal vent deposits on the seafloor. At 300 to 350{degree}C, 500 bars, the stability of caminite is predicted to increase relative to estimates originally computed from solubility measurements in hydrothermal seawater experiments where no provision was made for ion-pairing between magnesium and chloride. The data presented in this study should, therefore, improve the accuracy of mass-transfer calculations designed to predict the fate of seawater-derived Mg in the oceanic crust.","","","","","","United States","1990-12-01T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: Geochimica et Cosmochimica Acta; (USA); Journal Volume: 54:12","","Medium: X; Size: Pages: 3283-3294","","","","Journal ID: ISSN 0016-7037; CODEN: GCACA","10.1016/0016-7037(90)90285-S","","2016-05-25T00:00:00Z","5982426","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/5982426","","Geochimica et Cosmochimica Acta; (USA)","","54:12"

These two marginal wells have about 50% of the chloride of the deep fluid, indicating dilution by cold groundwater. Chloride-bearing springs discharge 6 km north of the zone of upflow and are even further diluted by cold groundwater than the wells on the margin of the system. The tritium data in this hydrologically rather simple system indicate that there is a mean residence time of greater than 100 years for the groundwater diluent; also, older water is mixed with <25% of young (thermonuclear, post-1955) water before the mixture dilutes outflowing chloride fluid from the deep system. The deep chloride fluid has a {sup 36}Cl/Cl ratio of 2.6 {times} 10{sup {minus}15} and a {sup 36}Cl concentration of 106 atoms per 10{sup {minus}6} kg. This fluid has a lower ration (by a factor of 90) and a higher absolute concentration (by a factor of 7) than present-day stream water. However, the marginal wells have been diluted by groundwater with at least 500 {sup 36}Cl atoms per 10{sup {minus}6} kg, 30 times richer in {sup 36}Cl than present-day stream waters. This spike is most likely due to circulation of precipitation formed during thermonuclear testing to depths of 1,000 m. The amount of {sup 36}Cl in the deep fluid at Mokai is 5-10 times less than that predicted from a calculation of the neutron fluxes in the silicic reservoir and underlying greywacke basement rocks.

Tourmaline-bearing breccia pipes are associated with the porphyritic granodiorite intrusions. An erosional unconformity separates the Sardine Formation from the overlying Elk Lake formation. The alteration patterns in the two formations are consistent with the development of hydrothermal systems during the eruption of each formation. However, the development of the two hydrothermal systems is separated by a period of erosion of the older volcanic pile. Early formation of mineralization that resembles porphyry copper deposits occurred within the Sardine Formation, and later, after eruption of the Elk Lake formation, epithermal veins and alteration developed along faults, fractures, and the margins of dikes in the Sardine Formation.","","","","","","United States","1990-11-10T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: Journal of Geophysical Research; (United States); Journal Volume: 95:B12","","Medium: X; Size: Pages: 19,601-19,610","","","","Journal ID: ISSN 0148-0227; CODEN: JGREA","10.1029/JB095iB12p19601","","2016-05-23T00:00:00Z","5290771","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/5290771","","Journal of Geophysical Research; (United States)","","95:B12"

The experimental creep response of this mantle-analog material is well-modeled as a Burgers solid, displaying a steady-state creep that is preceded by a transient deceleration. Calculated attenuation spectra are based on the Burgers solid viscosities and elastic constants obtained from the creep experiments. The attenuation becomes total and zero in the low- and high-frequency limits, respectively, as is appropriate for polycrystalline olivine having a diffusional creep rheology.

Both the magnitude (Q{sub E}{sup {minus}1} {approx} 15) and central frequency of this loss maximum increase with temperature.

In higher-temperature steamfloods the amount of CO{sub 2} produced is such that the only viable source is carbonate minerals. The authors show by reference to CO{sub 2} concentrations in natural geothermal systems that in most common rocks and sediments, CO{sub 2} is generated naturally under hydrothermal ({approximately}572{degrees}F) conditions by the dissolution of carbonate minerals. CO{sub 2} solubility is a strong positive function of temperature and, at 572{degrees}F, is more than sufficient to account for high CO{sub 2} concentrations like those encountered in a steamflood pilot test. A linear kinetic model is developed to describe chemical equilibration and CO{sub 2} generation in the hot parts of the reservoir. The model also describes CO{sub 2} removal through carbonate precipitation in the cooler parts of the rock formation where the fluid moves ahead of the thermal front. Changes in carbon isotope concentration are included in the model. The small difference between the {sup 13}C in the produced gas and the source carbonates suggests that little CO{sub 2} is precipitated as carbonate within that reservoir, a prediction that can be tested by poststeamflood coring.","","","","","","United States","1990-11-01T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: SPE (Society of Petroleum Engineers) Reservoir Engineering; (USA); Journal Volume: 5:4","","Medium: X; Size: Pages: 524-530","","","","Journal ID: ISSN 0885-9248; CODEN: SREEE; TRN: 91-010285","10.2118/16267-PA","","2016-04-18T00:00:00Z","6088615","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/6088615","","SPE (Society of Petroleum Engineers) Reservoir Engineering; (USA)","","5:4"

Diffusion coefficients (D) were determined from {sup 18}O concentration profiles measured with an ion microprobe. There is a good correlation of the D values with water fugacity but not with oxygen fugacity, hydrogen fugacity, hydrogen ion concentration, nor confining pressure over the range for which these parameters could be fixed independent of the water fugacity. Oxygen diffusion must involve the transport of an oxygen-bearing species, and the results of this study suggest that the transport species is molecular water. The rate-limiting step for oxygen diffusion could be either the rate of migration of the molecular water in the crystal or the rate of exchange of its oxygen with the feldspar structure. While protons may play a role in the mechanism of oxygen diffusion in feldspar, above the concentration supplied by pure water additional protons have no measurable effect on diffusion rates.","","","","","","United States","1990-11-01T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: Geochimica et Cosmochimica Acta; (USA); Journal Volume: 54:11","","Medium: X; Size: Pages: 2953-2964","","","","Journal ID: ISSN 0016-7037; CODEN: GCACA","10.1016/0016-7037(90)90113-Y","","2016-05-25T00:00:00Z","6026630","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/6026630","","Geochimica et Cosmochimica Acta; (USA)","","54:11"

The samples studied represent a variety of depositional settings and sedimentary facies. The oxide facies BIFs typically show LREE depleted patterns relative to shales, with (La/Nd){sub N} {ge} 1 and (La/Yb){sub N} mostly 0.3-0.8. The NASC-normalized REE patterns from the oxide facies BIFs are similar to modern metalliferous sediments, except for Ce and Eu. Positive Eu anomalies were found in all BIF samples, whereas Ce anomalies were variable. Both the oxide facies BIFs and modern metalliferous sediments typically have La/Yb ratios slightly higher than seawater. The REE data suggest that the Fe and REEs in BIFs coprecipitated from seawater as Fe oxy-hydroxides. The variable Ce anomalies are probably the result of diagenetic processes and redox cycling, similar to modern reducing environments. Comparison of mass balance estimates for REEs in the oceans based on Nd isotopic composition and on Eu anomalies results in a large discrepancy, which probably is a result of non-conservative behavior of Eu during mining of hydrothermal waters with ambient seawater. The REE data are consistent with a model for BIFs in which Fe and REEs derived from submarine hydrothermal systems are upwelled from the deep ocean, mixing with oxidizing surface water (with some continentally derived REEs), and deposited on the continental margins.","","","","","","United States","1990-11-01T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: Geochimica et Cosmochimica Acta; (USA); Journal Volume: 54:11","","Medium: X; Size: Pages: 2965-2977","","","","Journal ID: ISSN 0016-7037; CODEN: GCACA","10.1016/0016-7037(90)90114-Z","","2016-05-18T00:00:00Z","6026651","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/6026651","","Geochimica et Cosmochimica Acta; (USA)","","54:11"

Kennedy et al, however, show that near-surface processes such as boiling and dilution may also drastically affect {sup 3}He/{sup 4}He ratios of geothermal vapors. Helium isotope ratios were determined for several hot springs at Shoshone Geyser Basin of Yellowstone National Park for this study, along with other noble gas data. Stable isotope data and water and gas chemistry data for each spring were also compiled. The water chemistry indicates that there is one deep, hot thermal water in the area which is mixing with dilute meteoric water that has entered the system at depth. Spring HCO{sub 3}{sup {minus}} concentrations correlate with {sup 3}He/{sup 4}He values, as in nearby Lower Geyser Basin. This correlation is attributed to variable amounts of deep dilution of thermal waters with a relatively cool water that inhibits boiling at depth, thus preventing the loss of CO{sub 2} and magmatic He in the most diluted samples. Oxygen and hydrogen isotope data also support a boiling and dilution model, but to produce the observed fractionations, the boiling event would have to be extensive, with steam loss at the surface, whereas the boiling that affected the helium isotope ratios was probably a small scale event with steam loss at depth. It is possible that deep boiling occurred in the basin and that small amounts of steam escaped along fractures at about 500 m below the surface while all subsequently produced steam was lost near or at the surface.","","","","","","United States","1990-11-01T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: Geochimica et Cosmochimica Acta; (USA); Journal Volume: 54:11","","Medium: X; Size: Pages: 3103-3113","","","","Journal ID: ISSN 0016-7037; CODEN: GCACA","10.1016/0016-7037(90)90126-6","","2016-04-21T00:00:00Z","6026666","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/6026666","","Geochimica et Cosmochimica Acta; (USA)","","54:11"

The Na-K ion exchange properties of the glass were strongly influenced by its thermal history. Quenched glass preferentially fixed K rather than Na, and glass obtained by slow cooling showed the opposite trend. The present experimental results show clearly that glass as well as minerals can control the composition of the coexisting aqueous solution in hydrothermal systems.

The samples are representative of the major thermal areas within the park and span the range of fluid types. For the fluids, the B concentrations range from 0.043-2.69 mM/kg, and the {delta}{sup 11}B values range from {minus}9.3 to +4.4{per thousand}. There is no relationship between the dissolved B concentrations or isotope compositions with the concentration of any major element (other than Cl) or physical property. Each basin is characterized by a restricted range in B/Cl ratios and {delta}{sup 11}B values. Hot spring waters from the Norris Basin, Upper Geyser Basin, Calcite Springs, and Clearwater have {delta}{sup 11}B values close to that of unaltered rhyolite ({minus}5.2{per thousand}) and are interpreted to have derived their B from this source. Waters from Mammoth Hot Springs, Sheepeater, and Rainbow Springs have lower {delta}{sup 11}B values close to {minus}8{per thousand}. These lower values may reflect leaching of B from sedimentary rocks outside the Yellowstone caldera, but they are similar to the {delta}{sup 11}B value of hydrothermally altered rhyolite ({minus}9.7{per thousand}). Hence, the light boron isotope compositions recorded in these hot spring waters may reflect leaching of previously deposited hydrothermal minerals. Cooler springs along the Yellowstone River just outside the park boundary have lower B concentrations and higher {delta}{sup 11}B values that may reflect mixing with shallow meteoric water.","","","","","","United States","1990-10-01T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: Geochimica et Cosmochimica Acta; (USA); Journal Volume: 54:10","","Medium: X; Size: Pages: 2811-2815","","","","Journal ID: ISSN 0016-7037; CODEN: GCACA","10.1016/0016-7037(90)90015-D","","2009-12-17T00:00:00Z","6026682","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/6026682","","Geochimica et Cosmochimica Acta; (USA)","","54:10"

The study shows a complicated flow phenomenon caused by the unequal advance of the gas in fractures of different permeability or different inclinations. The results show that the gas breakthrough at the surface is governed by the high permeability fractures. At a constant rate of gas production the breakthrough is associated with a gas pressure drop at the bottom gas boundary. As a result, downward back flow takes place until the gas pressure builds up and reinitiates the upward displacement. It is concluded that calculations with average properties of the fracture permeability, for example, using the continuum approach, will underestimate the break-through time of the gas at the surface. Under constant pressure boundary conditions at the top of the cavern the average permeability will overestimate the amount of gas carried out by the fracture network. Under constant flow rate boundary conditions at the top of the cavern (i.e., bottom of the flow domain), calculations with average fracture permeability will overestimate the pressure in the cavern. The problem is of practical interest for low-level radioactive waste repositories located in hard rock below the sea bottom.","","","","","","United States","1990-10-01T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: Water Resources Research; (USA); Journal Volume: 26:10","","Medium: X; Size: Pages: 2425-2434","","","","Journal ID: ISSN 0043-1397; CODEN: WRERA; TRN: 91-021984","10.1029/WR026i010p02425","","2016-05-20T00:00:00Z","5505419","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/5505419","","Water Resources Research; (USA)","","26:10"

Tracer injection and collection are simulated for parallel and convergent flow fields. The impact of the use of different injection flow rates and the different locations of injection and collection points are studied. The results show that the transport time, dispersion, and the so-called mass balance fracture aperture are very sensitive to the location of the injection point and the injection flow rate. These anomalous effects appear to be consistent with observations in several recent field experiments. The implications of the calculated results on the analysis of tracer tests are discussed. It is concluded that because of the stochastic nature of variable fracture apertures (and their permeabilities) a point tracer test in a fracture is not sufficient to characterize the properties of the fracture. Dispersivities and apertures calculated from different tracer tests in the same fracture may vary by orders of magnitude depending on the flow rate and the location of the injection. However, a line injection of tracer, averaged over a series of adjacent points, may avoid some of these problems.","","","","","","United States","1990-10-01T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: Water Resources Research; (USA); Journal Volume: 26:10","","Medium: X; Size: Pages: 2377-2391","","","AC03-76SF00098","Journal ID: ISSN 0043-1397; CODEN: WRERA","10.1029/WR026i010p02377","","2016-05-18T00:00:00Z","5579359","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/5579359","","Water Resources Research; (USA)","","26:10"

We used these data (1) to calculate the speciation of Pd(II) in NaCl solutions at temperatures to 750C, pressures to 2 kbar, and values from 3 to 8, and (2) to predict the solubility of palladium at 2 kbar as a function of temperature, oxygen fugacity (f{sub O2}), pH, and total chloride concentration (m{sub T}Cl{sup {minus}}). Calculations indicate that as pH increases there is a sharp transition from chloride- to hydroxide-complex dominance at all chloride concentrations. This shift occurs at or below neutral pH in dilute solution, but at m{sub T}Cl{sup {minus}} {ge} 1.0, Pd(II) chloride complexes account for the majority of dissolved Pd(II) well into alkaline conditions. Solubility of palladium increases with increasing temperature, m{sub T}Cl{sup {minus}}, and f{sub O2}. At 700C, 2 kbar, and the f{sub O2} set by the FMQ buffer, palladium solubility in a 3.0 m NaCl solution is {approximately}0.3 ppm at a pH of 4, and one-unit pH variation can change palladium solubility by two orders of magnitude. These results suggest that PGE can be transported as chloride complexes in Cl-rich magmatic-hydrothermal solutions like those inferred from petrologic studies of the Stillwater and Bushveld complexes.","","","","","","United States","1990-10-01T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: Geology; (USA); Journal Volume: 18:10","","Medium: X; Size: Pages: 925-928","","","","Journal ID: ISSN 0091-7613; CODEN: GLGYB","10.1130/0091-7613(1990)018<0925:SASOPI>2.3.CO;2","","2016-05-26T00:00:00Z","6363092","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/6363092","","Geology; (USA)","","18:10"

The first phase formed with high-Mg calcite with approximately 35 mol % MgCO{sub 3}. This was replaced by Ca-rich, poorly ordered dolomite that was, in turn, replaced by ordered, stoichiometric dolomite. The rate of dolomitization and the rate at which unstable phases transformed to stoichiometric dolomite was related to the Mg{sup 2+}/Ca{sup 2+} ratio of the solution. There was no simple relationship between the Mg{sup 2+}/Ca{sup 2+} ratio solution and that of the products. SEM analyses of the products are interpreted to indicate that the unstable to stable transformation occurs by three, possibly simultaneous, mechanisms: (1) The small rhombs in the final products indicate that new crystals continue to nucleate during the reaction. (2) The large rhombs indicate that overgrowths of the more stable phase grew on the less stable phase. (3) The very irregular interiors indicate that the initial unstable products underwent a intercrystalline-scale dissolution and reprecipitation replacement.","","","","","","United States","1990-09-01T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: Journal of Geology; (USA); Journal Volume: 98:5","","Medium: X; Size: Pages: 739-748","","","","Journal ID: ISSN 0022-1376; CODEN: JGEOA","10.1086/629437","","2016-05-09T00:00:00Z","6241346","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/6241346","","Journal of Geology; (USA)","","98:5"

Locations for over 2,000 photographs in and near the vent field were determined using a seafloor transponder network. Then each photograph was described utilizing a classification system which provides detailed information concerning lava type, hydrothermal activity, sediment cover, geological structure, and biology. Resulting data were entered into a digital data base, and computer-generated maps were created that portray spatial relationships between selected geological variables. In general, the entire ASHES field is characterized by pervasive low-temperature venting. The most vigorous venting is concentrated in an approximately 80 m {times} 80 m area where there are several high-temperature vents including some which are producing high-temperature vapor-phase fluids derived from a boiling hydrothermal system. Lava types within the ASHES vent field are grouped into three distinct morphologies: (1) smooth (flat-surfaced, ropy, and whorled) sheet flows, (2) lobate flows, and (3) jumbled-sheet flows. The most intense hydrothermal venting is concentrated in the smooth sheet flows and the lobate flows. The location of the ASHES field is mainly attributable to faulting which defines the southwest caldera wall, but the concentration of intense venting appears to be related also to the spatial distribution of lava types in the vent field and their contrasting permeabilities. Other structural trends of faults and fissures within the field also influence the location of individual events.","","","","","","United States","1990-08-10T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: Journal of Geophysical Research; (United States); Journal Volume: 95:B8","","Medium: X; Size: Pages: 12,875-12,893","","","","Journal ID: ISSN 0148-0227; CODEN: JGREA","","","2009-12-16T00:00:00Z","5108926","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/5108926","","Journal of Geophysical Research; (United States)","","95:B8"

Individual mineral phases were identified using standard X ray diffraction procedures. Elemental composition and particle morphologies were determined by X ray fluorescence spectrometry and scanning electron microscopy/X ray energy spectrometry techniques. The vent particles were primarily composed of sphalerite, anhydrite, pyrite, pyrrhotite, chalcopyrite, barite, hydrous iron oxides, and amorphous silica. Grain size analyses of buoyant plume particles showed rapid particle growth in the first few centimeters above the vent orifice, followed by differential sedimentation of the larger sulfide and sulfate minerals out of the buoyant plume. The neutrally buoyant plume consisted of a lower plume, which was highly enriched in Fe, S, Zn, and Cu, and an upper plume, which was highly enriched in Fe and Mn. The upper plume was enriched in Fe and Mn oxyhydroxide particles, and the lower plume was enriched in suspended sulfide particles in addition to the Fe and Mn oxyhydroxide particles. The chemical data for the water column particles indicate that chemical scavenging and differential sedimentation processes are major factors controlling the composition of the dispersing hydrothermal particles.

In the vicinity of Axial Volcano at latitude 46{degree}N, distinct plumes were detected in 1980, 1982, and 1983 with {sup 3}He signatures up to {delta}({sup 3}He) = 64% at {approximately} 1,500 m depth at distances of {approximately} 10 km from the seamount summit. However, the same plumes had no detectable thermal signature, a paradox which is attributed to the high {sup 3}He/heat ratios and low salinities of the fluids venting within the caldera of Axial Volcano. Profiles directly over the seamount show hydrothermal {sup 3}He in the water column up to 300 m above the caldera floor, with the {sup 3}He signal increasing with depth to very high and uniform ratios of {delta}({sup 3}He) = 108-150% below the {approximately} 1,500-m caldera sill depth. Another apparent locus of hydrothermal input is Helium Basin, a depression on the northeast flank of Axial Volcano which had {delta}({sup 3}He) = 51% when first sampled in 1980. However, subsequent hydrocasts into Helium Basin in 1982 and 1983 yielded lower helium enrichments, suggesting either a decrease in hydrothermal input or flushing of the basin via a mixing event.

Evidence for unequivocal magnetic mineral modification by hydrothermal action is present only in a small percentage of extrusive basalts but is pervasive in diabases, gabbros, and ultramafic rocks. The studies reveal distinct correlations between magnetization intensity, thermomagnetic behavior, and magnetic mineralogy, grain size, style, and intensity of alteration and rock type. Layer 2A basalts are the source of median valley magnetic anomalies. The magnetic source may shift from the surface to deeper horizons with progressive seafloor aging and enhanced deuteric oxidation in layer 2B dikes and layer 3 gabbros and the formation of magnetite in derpentinized peridotites. This shift is influenced by fluctuations in the Curie isotherm related to the duration of active magma chambers and convective hydrothermal cells. The magnetic and mineralogic properties of oceanic rocks determined show the effects of a wide range of alteration processes that are variously related to depth in oceanic lithosphere, magmatic cooling history, and hydrothermal circulation.","","","","","","United States","1990-08-10T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: Journal of Geophysical Research; (United States); Journal Volume: 95:B8","","Medium: X; Size: Pages: 12,351-12,374","","","","Journal ID: ISSN 0148-0227; CODEN: JGREA","10.1029/JB095iB08p12351","","2016-04-25T00:00:00Z","5138347","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/5138347","","Journal of Geophysical Research; (United States)","","95:B8"

Lava chemistry and bathymetry indicate that Axial seamount is a discrete volcanic unit, with a more productive shallow magmatic plumbing system separate from the adjacent ridge segments. Despite this classic association of spreading center and hotspot volcanic activity, there is no evidence in the lavas for geochemical or isotopic enrichment typical of hotspot or mantle plume activity. The differences in composition between the Axial seamount lavas and the Juan de Fuca Ridge lavas are attributed to melting processes rather than to any fundamental differences in their mantle source compositions. The higher magma production rates, higher Sr, and lower silica saturation in the seamount lavas relative to the ridge lavas are thought to be a consequence of melt initiation at greater depths. The melting column producing the seamount lavas is thought to be initiated in the stability field of spinel peridotite, whereas the ridge lavas are produced from a melting column initiated at shallower levels, possibly within or close to the stability field of plagioclase peridotite. Implicit in this interpretation is the conclusion that the Juan de Fuca Ridge lavas, and by analogy most MORB, are generated at shallow mantle levels, mostly within the stability field of plagioclase peridotite. This interpretation also requires that for the upwelling mantle to intersect the solidus at different depths, the mantle supplying Axial seamount must be hotter than the rest of the Juan de Fuca Ridge. Axial seamount, therefore, reflects a thermal anomaly in the mantle, rather than a geochemically enriched ocean island basalt type mantle plume.","","","","","","United States","1990-08-10T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: Journal of Geophysical Research; (United States); Journal Volume: 95:B8","","Medium: X; Size: Pages: 12,713-12,733","","","","Journal ID: ISSN 0148-0227; CODEN: JGREA","10.1029/JB095iB08p12713","","2016-05-16T00:00:00Z","5108385","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/5108385","","Journal of Geophysical Research; (United States)","","95:B8"

Compositions range from a 300C, gas-enriched (285 mmol/kg CO{sub 2}), low-chlorinity ({approximately} 33% of seawater) fluid to a 328C, relatively gas-depleted (50 mmol/kg CO{sub 2}), high-chlorinity ({approximately} 116% of seawater) fluid. The entire range of measured compositions at ASHES is best explained by a single hydrothermal fluid undergoing phase separation while rising through the ocean crust, followed by partial segregation of the vapor and brine phases. Other mechanisms proposed to produce chlorinity variations in hydrothermal fluids (precipitation/dissolution of a chloride-bearing mineral or crustal hydration) cannot produce the covariation of chlorinity and gas content observed at ASHES. There is good argument of the measured fluid compositions generated by a simple model of phase separation, in which gases are partitioned according to Henry's law and all salt remains in the liquid phase. Significant enrichments in silica, lithium and boron in the low-chlorinity fluids over levels predicted by the model are attributed to fluid-rock interaction in the upflow zone. Depletions in iron and calcium suggest that these elements have been removed by iron-sulfide and anhydrite precipitation at some time in the history of the low-chlorinity fluids. The distribution of low- and high-chlorinity venting is consistent with mechanisms of phase segregation based on differential buoyancy or relative permeability. The relatively shallow depth of the seafloor (1,540 m) and the observed chemistry of ASHES fluids are consistent with phase separation in the sub-critical or near-critical region.","","","","","","United States","1990-08-10T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: Journal of Geophysical Research; (United States); Journal Volume: 95:B8","","Medium: X; Size: Pages: 12,895-12,921","","","","Journal ID: ISSN 0148-0227; CODEN: JGREA","10.1029/JB095iB08p12895","","2016-05-09T00:00:00Z","5108427","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/5108427","","Journal of Geophysical Research; (United States)","","95:B8"

The instrument is capable of measuring pressure of 1 mbar resolution and recording these measurements at 64 samples per hour for up to 15 months. Any significant change in the pressure record should indicate a change of depth associated with vertical ground movement, commonly indicative of active inflation or deflation of underlying magma bodies. Results from the first 9 months of the BPR deployment revealed a significant change in pressure, which is interpreted to represent a 15-cm subsidence of the caldera floor during two 2- to 3-week periods in April-June 1988. Also during these periods, an anomalous decline in temperature at the site was recorded that is correlated with an apparent increase in current velocity at the Axial Seamount Hydrothermal Emissions Study (ASHES) vent field, suggesting vigorous advection of cold water into the caldera. Concurrent oceanographic data from Geosat and from current meter arrays do not indicate any large-scale oceanographic phenomena capable of generating these simultaneous events. One mechanism to explain simultaneous ground subsidence and temperature decline at the caldera center and increased bottom current at the caldera margin is the generation of a buoyant parcel of heated water in response to the intrusion or the eruption of magma associated with volcanic deflation. Similar volcanic events also may have generated large midwater plumes that have been described previously along the southern Juan de Fuca Ridge.","","","","","","United States","1990-08-10T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: Journal of Geophysical Research; (United States); Journal Volume: 95:B8","","Medium: X; Size: Pages: 12,813-12,822","","","","Journal ID: ISSN 0148-0227; CODEN: JGREA","10.1029/JB095iB08p12813","","2016-04-28T00:00:00Z","5085686","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/5085686","","Journal of Geophysical Research; (United States)","","95:B8"

The earlier volcanic products of the hotspot, form eight volcanoes in the Cobb-Eickelberg seamount (CES) chain, show a westward age progression away from the hotspot and a westward increase in the age difference between the seamounts and the crust on which they formed. These results are consistent with movement of the Pacific plate over a fixed Cobb hotspot and eventual encroachment by the westwardly migrating Juan de Fuca ridge. CES lavas are slightly enriched in alkalies and incompatible elements relative to those of the Juan de Fuca ridge but they have Sr, Nd, and Pb isotopic compositions virtually identical to those found along the ridge. Therefore, Cobb hotspot is a stationary, upper mantle melting anomaly whose volcanic products show strong mid-ocean ridge basalt (MORB) affinity. These observations can be explained by low degrees of partial melting of entrained heterogeneous upper mantle MORB source material within a thermally driven lower mantle diapir or by an intrinsic MORB-like composition of the deeper mantle source region from which northeast Pacific plumes rise.","","","","","","United States","1990-08-10T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: Journal of Geophysical Research; (United States); Journal Volume: 95:B8","","Medium: X; Size: Pages: 12,697-12,711","","","","Journal ID: ISSN 0148-0227; CODEN: JGREA","10.1029/JB095iB08p12697","","2016-04-28T00:00:00Z","5085718","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/5085718","","Journal of Geophysical Research; (United States)","","95:B8"

For example, in amphiboles and talcs, four absorption bands are observed in the samples analyzed in this study that are due to hydroxyl linked to Mg{sub 3}, Mg{sub 2}Fe, MgFe{sub 2}, and Fe{sub 3} sites. The band intensities have been shown by other investigators to give the Fe:Fe+Mg ratio from transmission spectra. This study shows that the same equations can be used to obtain the ratio from reflectance spectra of unprepared samples. High-resolution reflectance spectroscopy of minerals may prove to be a very important tool in the laboratory, in the field using field-portable spectrometers, from aircraft, and from satellites looking at Earth or other planetary surfaces.","","","","","","United States","1990-08-10T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: Journal of Geophysical Research; (United States); Journal Volume: 95:B8","","Medium: X; Size: Pages: 12,653-12,680","","","","Journal ID: ISSN 0148-0227; CODEN: JGREA","10.1029/JB095iB08p12653","","2016-05-16T00:00:00Z","5055198","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/5055198","","Journal of Geophysical Research; (United States)","","95:B8"

Experiments were conducted at 425, 440, and 450{degree}C. Phase separation was controlled by adjusting pressure. Fractionation between the coexisting phases was less than 0.5{per thousand}. In contrast, fractionation between trigonal and tetrahedral B, at these temperatures, has been predicted to be approximately 8{per thousand}. The lack of fractionation suggests that the trigonal/tetrahedral speciation of B is similar in the two phases. Although this result may not be general for other fluid compositions, it is relevant to ridge crest hydrothermal solutions and indicates that the boron isotopic compositions of these solutions reflect the proportions of B from seawater and crustal sources and not phase separation.","","","","","","United States","1990-08-01T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: Geochimica et Cosmochimica Acta; (USA); Journal Volume: 54:8","","Medium: X; Size: Pages: 2337-2339","","","","Journal ID: ISSN 0016-7037; CODEN: GCACA","10.1016/0016-7037(90)90060-X","","2016-05-13T00:00:00Z","6014263","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/6014263","","Geochimica et Cosmochimica Acta; (USA)","","54:8"

On the basis of their results they stated that the model failed to remove the compositional dependence. Upon examining their results we find that the application of the Nielsen (1985) two-lattice melt models removes 90-96% of the compositional dependence. Interpretations of melt structure based on application of the two-lattice model are nebulous due to the simplifying assumption of ideal intra-lattice mixing. Nevertheless, a comparison of the results of several versions of the model indicate that in this system, Ti behaves more like a network former than a network modifier. In addition, the assumption of Ca-Al complexing does not improve the effectiveness of the model at resolving compositional dependence over the assumption that excess Al acts as a network modifier.","","","","","","United States","1990-08-01T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: Geochimica et Cosmochimica Acta; (USA); Journal Volume: 54:8","","Medium: X; Size: Pages: 2293-2295","","","","Journal ID: ISSN 0016-7037; CODEN: GCACA","10.1016/0016-7037(90)90053-N","","2016-05-25T00:00:00Z","6014302","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/6014302","","Geochimica et Cosmochimica Acta; (USA)","","54:8"

These inclusions are expected to be aligned perpendicular to the minimum compressional stress by stress relationships similar to those aligning industrial hydraulic fractures. At depths where the overburden stress is sufficiently large (typically below a few hundred metres) this minimum stress is usually horizontal, so that the EDA-cracks and hydraulic fractures are typically aligned vertically, striking parallel or subparallel, to the direction of maximum compression. This is confirmed by the polarizations of the split shear-waves along raypaths at depth in the crust. At the free surface, however, the vertical stress is zero (or approximately zero) and cracks (and hydraulic fractures) at shallow depths in intact rock tend to be horizontal.","","","","","","United States","1990-08-01T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: Geophysical Prospecting; (USA); Journal Volume: 38:6","","Medium: X; Size: Pages: 621-632","","","","Journal ID: ISSN 0016-8025; CODEN: GPPRA","10.1111/j.1365-2478.1990.tb01866.x","","2016-05-06T00:00:00Z","6822155","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/6822155","","Geophysical Prospecting; (USA)","","38:6"

To better understand how supercritical phase separation can affect trace element distributions, we conducted an experiment involving a Na-Ca-K-Cl fluid containing trace quantities of Sr, Ba, B, Li, and Br, which was allowed to separate into vapor and brine phases at 425, 440, and 450{degree}C by systematically adjusting pressure.

The results show that (1) the set of components most successful in one system is not necessarily portable to another system; (2) solution non-ideality within a sublattice severely limits applicability of two-lattice models; (3) rigorous application of two-lattice melt components may yield effective partition coefficients for major element components with no physical interpretation; and (4) the distinction between network-forming and network-modifying components in the sense of the two-lattice models is not clear cut. The algebraic description of two-lattice models is such that they will most successfully limit the compositional dependence of major and trace element solution behavior when the effective partition coefficient of the component of interest is essentially the same as the bulk partition coefficient of all other components within its sublattice.","","","","","","United States","1990-08-01T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: Geochimica et Cosmochimica Acta; (USA); Journal Volume: 54:8","","Medium: X; Size: Pages: 2297-2302","","","","Journal ID: ISSN 0016-7037; CODEN: GCACA","10.1016/0016-7037(90)90054-O","","2016-04-28T00:00:00Z","6236358","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/6236358","","Geochimica et Cosmochimica Acta; (USA)","","54:8"

Most lavas erupted on this right zone in historical time have traveled northeastward (toward Hilo), because their eruptive vents have been concentrated north of the rift zone's broad topographic axis. However, with few exceptions each successive historical eruption on the northeast rift zone has occurred farther southeast than the preceding one. Had the 1984 eruptive vents (the most southeasterly yet) opened less than 200 m farther southeast, the bulk of the 1984 lavas would have flowed away from Hilo. If this historical vent-migration pattern continues, the next eruption on the northeast rift zone could send lavas to the southeast, toward less populated areas. The historical Mauna Loa vent-migration patterns mimic southeastern younging of the Hawaiian-Emperor volcanic chain and may be cryptically related to northwestward movement of the Pacific plate. Systematic temporal-spatial vent-migration patterns may characterize eruptive activity at other volcanoes with flank activity and should be considered as an aid to long-term prediction of eruption sites.","","","","","","United States","1990-07-01T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: Geology; (USA); Journal Volume: 18:7","","Medium: X; Size: Pages: 611-613","","","","Journal ID: ISSN 0091-7613; CODEN: GLGYB","10.1130/0091-7613(1990)018<0611:IOHEVM>2.3.CO;2","","2016-04-22T00:00:00Z","6363031","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/6363031","","Geology; (USA)","","18:7"

Thermal conductivity ({lambda}) of a formation can be determined in situ by pouring or injecting liquid at an arbitrary temperature into a thermally equilibrated borehole and analyzing dissipation of the resulting thermal pulse. The authors used this technique in a shale by pouring diesel fuel into a borehole and obtained values for {lambda} within a few percent of the mean value obtained from cores. The test showed that the technique is relatively simple to apply and can readily be used to test multiple horizons simultaneously. A priori estimation of formation specific thermal capacity was necessary to obtain good results, apparently because the form of the thermal pulse was not well characterized in the test. This resulted from adding liquid to the borehole in a poorly controlled manner; injecting liquid using a tremie pipe would provide a better characterized pulse and is probably advisable when implementing this technique.","","","","","","United States","1990-06-10T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: Journal of Geophysical Research; (United States); Journal Volume: 95:B6","","Medium: X; Size: Pages: 8697-8704","","","","Journal ID: ISSN 0148-0227; CODEN: JGREA","10.1029/JB095iB06p08697","","2016-05-18T00:00:00Z","5009141","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/5009141","","Journal of Geophysical Research; (United States)","","95:B6"

Metasomatic events affecting the lithology of the Kidd volcanic complex include silicification, extensive CO{sub 2} metasomatism (carbonate), K-metasomatism (sericite-fuchsite), and chlorite and minor carbonate alterations. Petrographic evidence, supported by stable isotope and fluid inclusion studies, suggests that silicification and early carbonate alteration were synvolcanic, and therefore related to ore deposition. During subsequent extensive K-metasomatism, sericite precipitated in the rhyolite, and fuschsite precipitated in the ultramafic rocks. Although chlorite postdates K-metasomatism, the micas and chlorite are both found in anastomosing microfissures, commonly occupying the same set of fractures. Hydrothermal rutile formed by the breakdown of magnetite-ilmenite during K-metasomatism and chlorite alteration gives an age of 2624 {plus minus} 62 Ma (95% confidence level). It is therefore approximately 100 m.y. younger than syngenetic massive sulfide mineralization (2712 {plus minus} 2 Ma). Sulfide stringers within sericite and chlorite veins suggest some remobilization of the ores during these later events. This alteration assemblage, is identical to that found associated with many lode-gold deposits in the Superior province. Recent dating of micas and rutile associated with gold deposits in the Abitibi subprovince gives comparable ages to the rutile in the Kidd volcanic complex, which must therefore record a widespread, late hydrothermal event affecting mineralized rocks.","","","","","","United States","1990-06-01T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: Geology; (USA); Journal Volume: 18:6","","Medium: X; Size: Pages: 505-508","","","","Journal ID: ISSN 0091-7613; CODEN: GLGYB","10.1130/0091-7613(1990)018<0505:ATAHOM>2.3.CO;2","","2016-05-05T00:00:00Z","6419177","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/6419177","","Geology; (USA)","","18:6"

Preliminary mapping and sampling of the field reveal: a setting nested on nearly sediment-free fault blocks 300 m above the rift valley floor 2.6 km from the axis; a spectrum of venting types from seeps to black smokers; high conductive heat flow estimated to be equivalent to the convective flux of multiple black smokers through areas of the sea floor sealed by a caprock of clastic breccia primarily derived from basalt with siliceous cement and barite pore fillings; and a vent biota with Juan de Fuca Ridge affinities.

To date, the most reliable data have been collected from single crystals. The authors have extended these studies with electrical conductivity measurements on a dunite from North Carolina, in the temperature range of 600-1,200 C and under controlled oxygen fugacity. Observations of conductivity as a function of oxygen fugacity and temperature demonstrate that conduction in the dunite is indistinguishable from conduction in single olivine crystals. Thus the common practice of exaggerating the single-crystal conductivities to account for conduction by grain boundary phases in the mantle is unnecessary. Because the dunite conductivity is consistent with that published for single crystals under similar conditions, the authors have made a combined analysis of these data. Conductivity as a function of temperature between 600 and 1,450 C displays three conduction mechanisms whose activation energies may be recovered by nonlinear least squares fitting, yielding activation energies of 0.21 {plus minus} 2.56 {times} 10{sup {minus}19} J below 720 C, 2.56 {plus minus} 0.02 {times} 10{sup {minus}19} J between 720 C and 1,500 C and 11.46 {plus minus} 0.90 {times} 10{sup {minus}19} J above 1,500 C. The behavior of conductivity as a function of oxygen fugacity is well explained by a model in which an f{sub O{sub 2}}-independent population of charge carriers is supplemented at high oxygen fugacities with a population that is proportional to f{sub O{sub 2}}{sup 0.3}. This parametrization produces a clear correlation of the f{sub O{sub 2}} dependent term with iron content, which is otherwise obscured by variations in conductivity among olivines.","","","","","","United States","1990-05-10T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: Journal of Geophysical Research; (United States); Journal Volume: 95:B5","","Medium: X; Size: Pages: 6967-6978","","","","Journal ID: ISSN 0148-0227; CODEN: JGREA","10.1029/JB095iB05p06967","","2016-05-25T00:00:00Z","5095701","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/5095701","","Journal of Geophysical Research; (United States)","","95:B5"

Particulate material concentrated from these samples was lysed enzymatically (enz) and by a combination of enzyme and French press treatment (fp). Concentrations of partially purified DNA recovered from these lysates were determined spectrofluorometrically. Ambient seawater surrounding the vents was found to contain low DNA concentrations, 0.18 to 0.32 ng of DNA per ml, while low-temperature vent samples yielded significantly higher concentrations of 0.37 to 2.12 ng of DNA per ml. Although DNA recovery values from superheated (210 to 345{degree}C) flange samples were not significantly different from ambient seawater values, most of the superheated (174 to 357{degree}C) smoker fluid samples contained particulate DNA in concentrations too high to be attributable to entrained seawater. Detailed sampling at one smoker site demonstrated not only the existence of significant levels of particulate DNA in the superheated smoker fluids but also the presence of an elevated microbial population in the buoyant plume 20 to 100 m above the smoker. These results underscore the heterogeneity of smoker environments within a given hydrothermal vent fluid and indicate that microorganisms exist in some superheated fluids.","","","","","","United States","1990-05-01T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: Applied and Environmental Microbiology; (USA); Journal Volume: 56:5","","Medium: X; Size: Pages: 1440-1447","","","","Journal ID: ISSN 0099-2240; CODEN: AEMID","","","2009-12-17T00:00:00Z","6630994","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/6630994","","Applied and Environmental Microbiology; (USA)","","56:5"

Isotope ratios were obtained for the analcime framework, the channel water, and bulk water. Analcimes from Surtsey (145{degree}C), DSDP Hole 417A (30 to 55{degree}C), and Guam (25{degree}C) were used to constrain the fractionation factors below 300{degree}C. Analcime channel water exchanged completely with external water in all runs. Although some retrograde exchange may have occurred during quenching, the results indicate that the channel water is depleted in {sup 18}O relative to bulk water by a constant value of {approximately}5{per thousand}, nearly independent of temperature. Analcime is the first hydrated mineral found to have water of hydration depleted in {sup 18}O. Analcime framework oxygen exchanged 80, 90, and 96% at 300{degree}C for 412 h, 350{degree}C for 178 h, and 400{degree}C for 120 h, respectively. Equilibrium {Delta}{sup 18}O ({per thousand}) are as follows: 2.9 (400{degree}C), 4.5 (350{degree}C), and 5.8 (300{degree}C) for the experimental runs and 12.2 (145{degree}C) and 24.2 to 28.2 (30-55{degree}C) for the empirical data. The analcime-water fractionation curve is within experimental error of that of calcite-water. The exchange had little effect on grain morphology and does not involve recrystallization. This is the fastest exchange observed for a silicate. The rapid exchange rates indicate that zeolites in active high-temperature geothermal areas are in oxygen isotopic equilibrium with ambient fluids. Once calibrated, zeolites may be among the best low-temperature oxygen isotope geothermometers.","","","","","","United States","1990-05-01T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: Geochimica et Cosmochimica Acta; (USA); Journal Volume: 54:5","","Medium: X; Size: Pages: 1359-1368","","","","Journal ID: ISSN 0016-7037; CODEN: GCACA","10.1016/0016-7037(90)90161-D","","2016-05-09T00:00:00Z","6014161","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/6014161","","Geochimica et Cosmochimica Acta; (USA)","","54:5"

Solution data were collected during dissolution runs for the same crystals which were spectroscopically analyzed. We found that leached zones depleted in Na, Al, and O develop during the initial, incongruent phase of dissolution. Angle resolved XPS (ARXPS) demonstrated that Na and Al are significantly depleted from the upper few monolayers. Depths of leaching, which range from 10 to 900 {angstrom}, decrease with increasing pH in the acid region and increase with pH in the basic region. Based on calculated dissolution rates the depth of leaching can be roughly correlated with the release rate of Si. Preliminary evaluations of diffusion transport rates through leached layers suggest that dissolution is not rate limited by diffusion. Instead, the kinetics of dissolution seem to be related to the intrinsic rate of structural hydrolysis. Using the XPS and solution data in conjunction with theoretical and experimental studies in the literature, we propose a dissolution mechanism based on initial ion exchange followed by the hydrolysis of Al and Si, which is modeled as the breakdown of activated complexes formed at bridging oxygen (O{sub br}) sites. Elemental mass balances based on comparisons between the XPS and solution data suggest that dissolution occurs non-uniformly and is probably preferentially constrained to dislocations and macroscopic defects within the structure.","","","","","","United States","1990-05-01T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: Geochimica et Cosmochimica Acta; (USA); Journal Volume: 54:5","","Medium: X; Size: Pages: 1267-1281","","","","Journal ID: ISSN 0016-7037; CODEN: GCACA","10.1016/0016-7037(90)90152-B","","2016-05-06T00:00:00Z","6014207","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/6014207","","Geochimica et Cosmochimica Acta; (USA)","","54:5"

Zeolites are hydrous aluminosilicates which possess unique properties such as reversible dehydration, selective sorption, molecular sieving, ion exchange, and catalysis. While we known a great deal about their occurrence, chemistry, crystal structure, and physical properties, we know relatively little about the petrogenesis of zeolites, their role in water-rock interaction, or the structure and properties of the zeolite channel water. Stable isotope research on zeolites can yield two kinds of information. Oxygen isotope ratios of the zeolite framework may be used to constrain the conditions of zeolite formation such as temperature, fluid composition, and the nature of precursor materials. Oxygen and hydrogen isotope ratios of zeolite channel water may be used to determine the origin of the water and to study the process of dehydration. Due to experimental difficulties, little work has been done on the stable isotope geochemistry of zeolites. This study was undertaken in order to address the following questions: (1) Is it possible to obtain reproducible and accurate oxygen isotope ratios of a zeolite (2) Might zeolites be useful as low-temperature geothermometers (3) What is the origin of the zeolitic water Is simply the last water vapor to which the sample was exposed, or does it reflect some past atmospheric or fluid composition and (4) Can oxygen isotope analysis be used to identify primary igneous analcime","","","","","","United States","1990-05-01T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: Geochimica et Cosmochimica Acta; (USA); Journal Volume: 54:5","","Medium: X; Size: Pages: 1369-1386","","","","Journal ID: ISSN 0016-7037; CODEN: GCACA","10.1016/0016-7037(90)90162-E","","2016-04-25T00:00:00Z","6265087","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/6265087","","Geochimica et Cosmochimica Acta; (USA)","","54:5"

An electrically heated strip, with a width equal to 1/4 of the length of a side of the enclosure, is centered on the lower inside surface of the enclosure. For the experiments reported here, the top of the fluid layer is maintained at a constant temperature and the depth of the layer is equal to the width of the heated strip. The large viscosity variation characteristic of magma convection is simulated by using corn syrup as the working fluid. Measured velocity and temperature distributions as well as overall heat transfer rates are presented. The experiment is numerically simulated through use of a finite element computer program.

Forced convection is the only mechanism found to be generally able to generate the anomalies. The Valles-Penedes basin (NE Spain) is used to illustrate the results of the different mechanisms. In general, it is concluded that forced convection will generate geothermal anomalies when several conditions are met: water circulation has to be deep and slow in its descent; depp reaching faults must exist to allow a rapid ascension of water; and some sort of sealing along the ascending conduit has to prevent mixing with cold water. The hydraulic model of the Valles-Penedes graben rules out a possible circulation through the sediments filling the basin, and therefore a circulation model through the adjacent horst is proposed. This model is supported by isotopic data. Such a model is not restricted to horst and graben structures but can be used to explain anomalies found in compressive geological settings.","","","","","","United States","1990-04-10T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: Journal of Geophysical Research; (United States); Journal Volume: 95:B4","","Medium: X; Size: Pages: 4887-4894","","","","Journal ID: ISSN 0148-0227; CODEN: JGREA","10.1029/JB095iB04p04887","","2016-04-26T00:00:00Z","5138362","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/5138362","","Journal of Geophysical Research; (United States)","","95:B4"

It is unlikely that a karst surface could have developed in this restricted time period. The chert breccias of Guernsey and Treasure Mountain show no evidence of abrasion. This chert appears to have been precipitated from silica dissolved by geothermal waters in Tertiary time and later fractured by slumping. Earlier workers found much debris from overlying formations in Leadville solution features, but most dismissed the possibility of late-state subsurface dissolution contemporaneous with ore deposition. The authors postulate that subsurface solution took place in Tertiary time during the heating phase associated with orogeny, mineralization, and igneous activity. Dissolution was localized by pressure differences and fluid flow near major faults associated with mineralization. The largest solution areas are associated with deep-seated faults such as the Rio Grande Rift. Moderate to intense local solution is associated with mineralization. Small-scale, local solution and alteration may be associated with topographically controlled hot spring systems.","","","","","","United States","1990-04-01T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: Mountain Geologist; (USA); Journal Volume: 27:2","","Medium: X; Size: Pages: 57-67","","","","Journal ID: ISSN 0027-254X; CODEN: MOGEA","","","2009-12-17T00:00:00Z","6047171","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/6047171","","Mountain Geologist; (USA)","","27:2"

This low coordination is attributed, by analogy with the structural behavior of glasses compressed at 300 K, to the instability of higher coordinations in glasses of these compositions on decompression. Spectra of glasses formed in a hydrous environment document that water is extensively soluble in melts at these high pressures and temperatures.

This work concentrated on high-temperature, fracture-dominated loss zones rather than the matrix loss zones more typical of oil and gas drilling. The results, however, are applicable to the petroleum industry, particularly because of the inevitable progression into hotter, more fracture-dominated petroleum reservoirs. The lost circulation materials (LCM's) for geothermal applications were analyzed with laboratory tools developed specifically for that purpose. Test results of commercial materials and mathematical models for evaluating their performance are presented. Physical attributes that govern the performance of LCM's in geothermal wells are identified and correlated with test results.","","","","","","United States","1990-03-01T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: Journal of Petroleum Technology; (USA); Journal Volume: 42:3","","Medium: X; Size: Pages: 328-337","","","","Journal ID: ISSN 0022-3522; CODEN: JPTJA","10.2118/18022-PA","","2016-05-24T00:00:00Z","6931372","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/6931372","","Journal of Petroleum Technology; (USA)","","42:3"

The state's Oil and Gas Division states simply that the field is finite and is being overproduced. With four percent of the state's electricity generated at the Geysers, resolving the problem quickly is at the top of the agenda for the California Energy Commission (CEC)-and the geothermal industry. A number of technical solutions have been proposed, but ultimately the rate of extraction may have to be controlled in order to maximize the resource. The Geysers reservoir covers some thirty square miles in Sonoma and Lake counties about 100 miles north of San Francisco. A dry steam reservoir, it differ from many other of the world's geothermal resources which depend on hot water fields. But, with a capacity of 2,050 MW, it is the world's largest geothermal development. In the past two years, operators have derated the field 25 percent because of the falling steam supply. Over the entire field plants are delivering only 50 percent of their capacity. Even with the decline, the Geysers will still lead second-ranked Philippines in production.","","","","","","United States","1990-02-01T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: Independent Energy; (United States); Journal Volume: 20:2","","Medium: X; Size: Pages: 56-57","","","","Journal ID: ISSN 1043-7320; CODEN: XY987","","","2009-12-16T00:00:00Z","5424813","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/5424813","","Independent Energy; (United States)","","20:2"

Forty-six new heat flow measurements, 12 revised heat flow values, and several hundred geothermal gradient measurements indicate extensive geothermal anomalies with heat flows ranging from 80 to 140 mW/m{sup 2} in the northern and central Great Plains. Heat flow in the Great Plains outside the geothermally anomalous regions ranges from 40-60 mW/m{sup 2}. The heat flow anomalies result from the thermal effects of regional groundwater flow where it moves upward either within a dipping aquifer or by cross-formational flow through fractures. The gravitational driving force for the ground-water flow derives from the eastward sloping surface of the Great Plains, and the locations of the geothermal anomalies are determined by the structures of the aquifers and the crystal-line basement rocks. The most widespread and largest-amplitude geothermal anomaly occurs in southern South Dakota and northern Nebraska. Another large anomaly occurs on the eastern flank of the Denver Basin. The source of anomalous heat is shown to be nontectonic, and theoretical arguments for normal continental heat flow in the Great Plains are supported. Another difference from the results of previous heat flow studies is that the thermal conductivities of shales in the Mesozoic strata in the Great Plains are about 40% lower than the conductivities that commonly have been used for shales. This observation and recent studies which have suggested lower thermal conductivities for shales in the Great Plains are the reasons for revision of some previous heat flow calculations. A significant result is that the high heat flow zone that previously has been shown to extend through North Dakota into Canada is a region of normal continental heat flow.","","","","","","United States","1990-01-10T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: Journal of Geophysical Research; (United States); Journal Volume: 95:B1","","Medium: X; Size: Pages: 353-374","","","","Journal ID: ISSN 0148-0227; CODEN: JGREA","10.1029/JB095iB01p00353","","2016-05-05T00:00:00Z","5109696","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/5109696","","Journal of Geophysical Research; (United States)","","95:B1"

The most permeable joints must be modelled, and the produced fluid taken to be the weighted average of the individual flow path temperatures. The results provided in this paper, are sensitive to the flow distribution, the fracture area and reservoir volume. They are not sensitive to changes that have occurred in the reservoir over its lifetime. It is shown that care must be taken in developing models based on the thermal results alone, since only a few parameters are statistically significant. Introduction of the tracer results effectively constrains the choice of some of these parameters. Good estimates for the remaining free parameters can be found from the well logs and seismic data. Careful use of the model, with appropriate data, would give a good estimate for the thermal performance of an HDR system.","","","","","","United States","1990-01-01T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: Geothermics (International Journal of Geothermal Research and its Applications); (United States); Journal Volume: 19:3","","Medium: X; Size: Pages: 247-258","","","","Journal ID: ISSN 0375-6505; CODEN: GTMCA","10.1016/0375-6505(90)90045-D","","2016-05-24T00:00:00Z","5633643","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/5633643","","Geothermics (International Journal of Geothermal Research and its Applications); (United States)","","19:3"

Temperature, anomaly, and heat flux are calculated in cross-sections through two-dimensional (2D) and axisymmetric (3D) structures. The anomalous temperature field extends to a lateral distance of about 3 diapir radii from the diapir center. At depth the anomaly disappears at about 2.5 times the depth to the base of the diapir. It appears that 3D structures focus the heat flux stronger than 2D structures. Thus the highest heat flux should be higher over 3D structures. On the other hand the areal extent of the temperature anomaly around the salt structures is less in the 3D case. Calculation examples indicate that low temperature geothermal energy exploitation of the formations around the top of a salt diapir can be favored by a reduced drilling depth of 30% compared with the diapir-free case. It is further concluded that surface heat flow measurements in profiles across the diapir may be used in distinguishing between salt and shale diapirs.","","","","","","United States","1990-01-01T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: Geothermics (International Journal of Geothermal Research and its Applications); (United States); Journal Volume: 19:3","","Medium: X; Size: Pages: 273-284","","","","Journal ID: ISSN 0375-6505; CODEN: GTMCA","10.1016/0375-6505(90)90047-F","","2016-05-24T00:00:00Z","5860006","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/5860006","","Geothermics (International Journal of Geothermal Research and its Applications); (United States)","","19:3"

This study uses all relevant information from earlier (1965-1970) geophysical exploration surveys, results from detailed seismic reflection and airborne magnetic surveys made in 1984, and information from 44 exploration and production wells. The seismic reflection survey (12 fold CMP) shows that reflections from the top and the bottom of concealed Quaternary volcanic extrusions and pyroclastic flows can be obtained inside a hot-water system down to about 1 km depth. Processing of the data yields a detailed seismic velocity structure showing significant horizontal and vertical velocity changes inside and outside the filed which, in turn, allowed reinterpretation of earlier seismic refraction profiles.","","","","","","United States","1990-01-01T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: Geothermics (International Journal of Geothermal Research and its Applications); (UK); Journal Volume: 19:2","","Medium: X; Size: Pages: 129-150","","","","Journal ID: ISSN 0375-6505; CODEN: GTMCA","10.1016/0375-6505(90)90013-2","","2016-04-19T00:00:00Z","6532350","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/6532350","","Geothermics (International Journal of Geothermal Research and its Applications); (UK)","","19:2"

Selection is based on complete water analyses with a good ionic balance. Measured temperature ranges from 21 to 73{degrees}C and discharge rates range from 0.1 to 40 l/s. Studied springs show mainly chloride type waters. Geothermometers applied are: silica, Na/K, Na-K-Ca, Na-K-Ca-Mg, Na/Li and Mg/Li. Temperatures estimated by those geothermometers are plotted against the measured values to evaluate the applicability of the geothermometers used.

The model was extended to 7 km depth to simulate a deep heat sweep of naturally convecting meteoric waters in a granitic crust. The permeability structure was obtained by numerical modelling, using observed well temperatures, the overall pressure response of the reservoir induced by production, and inferred natural heat loss ({approx} 5 MW) as matching parameters. Modelling has shown that the Fuzhou system can be simulated as a large natural convection cell which sweeps heat from upper crustal levels ({ge}5 km depth) into segments of a deep-reaching fracture-zone of small cross-sectional extent. The system is driven by the crustal heat flow (about 70 mW/m{sup 2}) and terrain-induced forced convection.

In spite of this restriction, the density of the simulated liquid exceeds that of the corresponding models of quartz, coesite and cristobalite at high pressure. The efficient compression of the liquid results from a continuous restructuring of the network that leaves the mean Si-Si distance virtually unchanged and does not require and increase in the coordination number.

Synkinematic and postkinematic veins record fluid transport and metasomatism during prograde metamorphism and uplift. Vein and host-rock mineralogy and whole-rock compositions demonstrate large-scale chemical redistribution, especially of Si and alkali elements. Veins and host rocks trend toward isotopic equilibration with aqueous fluids with {delta}{sup 18}O{sub SMOW}=+13{per thousand} {plus minus} 1{per thousand}. The likely source for these fluids is in lower temperature, sediment-rich parts of the subduction zone. Carbon isotope systematics support this conclusion and indicate the influence of an organic C source. Quartz solubility relations indicate the importance of fluid-flow paths in chemical redistribution during subduction. These results document large-scale fluid flow and the complexity of possible metasomatic and mechanical mixing processes at intermediate levels of subduction zones. The record of subduction-zone mass transfer in the Catalina Schist is compatible with the record inferred for greater depths from geochemical and petrologic studies of arc magmatism.","","","","","","United States","1989-11-01T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: Geology; (USA); Journal Volume: 17:11","","Medium: X; Size: Pages: 976-980","","","","Journal ID: ISSN 0091-7613; CODEN: GLGYB","","","2009-12-17T00:00:00Z","6159471","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/6159471","","Geology; (USA)","","17:11"

A number of numerical studies have been carried out using Darcy's law to formulate the natural convection heat transfer mathematically in enclosures of internally heat-generating porous media. This paper uses Irmay's momentum equation for radial and axial equations that include inertia terms with models an internally heat-generating porous medium in a short, vertical circular cylinder (R = 2m, H = 4m). The cylinder side and top are isothermal and at the same temperature (T{sub {infinity}}). The bottom surface of the cylinder is adiabatic. The variations in density and viscosity with temperature and inertia are investigated. For slow flows, the effect of inertia would be expected to be small. For large temperature variations, the effects of variable dynamic viscosity and density are expected to be large. The density and the dynamic viscosity of air were represented by the relationships {rho} = {rho}{sub {infinity}} (1 {minus} (T {minus} T{sub {infinity}})/T) and v = v{sub {infinity}} (1 + 2(T {minus} T{sub {infinity}})/T{sub {infinity}}).

Growth has strained the capacity of growing, St. Lucia Electricity Services (LUCELEC), which controls electrical power generation and distribution on the island. Government planners realize that expanding their electric power infrastructure is a necessary prerequisite for continued economic development on this island of 238 square miles and consequently view geothermal for the island's baseload demand with diesel handling peaking requirements.

We present 191 new heat flow measurements from the northern Red Sea forming three traverses across the water covered portion of the rift. The heat flow across the rift systematically increases from values of about 125 mW/m{sup 2} seaward of the coasts to average values greater than 250 mW/m{sup 2} in the axial depression. The heat flow measurements are evaluated for environmental disturbances. These are found to be generally small. The largest estimated disturbance results from the relief of the seafloor and of the top of a subbottom evaporite layer. The relief on these surfaces can account for the 20% point to point scatter typically observed in the heat flow measurements. Limits are placed on systematic disturbances to the heat flow pattern across the rift. The estimated largest systematic disturbance results from sediment blanketing which may cause a reduction in the heat flow on the order of 10%.","","","","","","United States","1989-09-10T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: Journal of Geophysical Research; (USA); Journal Volume: 94:B9","","Medium: X; Size: Pages: 12239-12266","","","","Journal ID: ISSN 0148-0227; CODEN: JGREA","10.1029/JB094iB09p12239","","2016-05-17T00:00:00Z","5325490","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/5325490","","Journal of Geophysical Research; (USA)","","94:B9"

New experiments reacting diabase and evolved seawater were carried out to reproduce earlier published observations of Cl depletions attributed to formation of an ephemeral Cl-bearing mineral. The absence of any Cl depletions in the present study suggests that the formation of Cl-bearing minerals is not sufficiently widespread to account for the observed salinity variations in the vent fluids. A re-evaluation of both field and laboratory evidence has led to a new model for subseafloor circulation that accounts for salinity variations as well as other chemical and mineralogic observations. In place of a simple single-pass convection system, the authors propose that the sea floor systems consist of two vertically nested convection cells in which a brine layer at depth heats and drives an overlying seawater cell. Such layering of salinities, a process known in fluid mechanics as double-diffusive convection, is an expected result when convection is induced in saline fluids. The process provides for stable high-temperature heat transfer upward from the cracking front adjacent to the magma, and for limited chemical exchange of the brine with the overlying seawater to explain salinity variations and high metal contents in the vent fluids. The brine also provides an effective medium to produce the secondary mineral assemblages observed in rocks from the mid-ocean ridges and ophiolites unsuccessfully produced in laboratory studies using seawater. The brine originates from the two-phase separation of seawater during magmatic/tectonic events and accumulates and remains relatively stable in the region immediately above the magma chamber.","","","","","","United States","1989-09-01T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: Journal of Geology; (USA); Journal Volume: 97:5","","Medium: X; Size: Pages: 613-623","","","","Journal ID: ISSN 0022-1376; CODEN: JGEOA","10.1086/629338","","2016-05-20T00:00:00Z","6987503","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/6987503","","Journal of Geology; (USA)","","97:5"

This may be accounted for by the common assumption that ferric and ferrous iron in silicate glasses have equivalent Moessbauer absorption efficiencies at room temperature, which has been shown to be invalid for several crystalline materials. Although this assumption has been demonstrated to be valid for glasses with low concentrations of total iron, the approximation breaks down when total iron concentrations approach 14 wt% Fe{sub 2}O{sub 3}. The authors have measured ferrous iron concentrations in 65 Na{sub 2}O-FeO-Fe{sub 2}O{sub 3}-SiO{sub 2} glasses quenched from melts equilibrated in air between 926 and 1,583{degree}C using a colorimetric wet chemical method. These data were used to derive a symmetric, regular solution model for ferric-ferrous equilibria which has a standard error of 0.36 (2{sigma}) in the prediction of wt% FeO. Additional liquids with initial compositions close to the stoichiometry of acmite (NaFe{sup 3+}Si{sub 2}O{sub 6}) but which crossed the perferruginous join due to sodium loss during high-temperature equilibration (1,420-1,540{degree}C) are significantly reduced relative to other Na{sub 2}O-FeO-Fe{sub 2}O{sub 3}-SiO{sub 2} liquids. A re-interpretation of the density data of Dingwell et al. (1988) based upon these wet chemical ferric-ferrous data demonstrates that the partial molar volume of Fe{sub 2}O{sub 3} is independent of composition in the Na{sub 2}O-FeO-Fe{sub 2}O{sub 3}-SiO{sub 2} system with a derived value of 41.78 {plus minus} 0.41 cc/mol at 1,400{degree}C.","","","","","","United States","1989-09-01T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: Geochimica et Cosmochimica Acta; (USA); Journal Volume: 53:9","","Medium: X; Size: Pages: 2195-2204","","","","Journal ID: ISSN 0016-7037; CODEN: GCACA","10.1016/0016-7037(89)90343-8","","2016-04-15T00:00:00Z","7024618","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/7024618","","Geochimica et Cosmochimica Acta; (USA)","","53:9"

Dissolved Ca, Na, and pH for all experiments responded systematically to differences in dissolved SiO{sub 2} concentrations and the compositions of plagioclase reactants. Diabase alteration at low fluid/rock mass ratios (0.5 to 1) produces fluids undersaturated with respect to quartz during hydration of primary olivine and orthopyroxene, whereas basalt alteration under similar conditions yields fluids slightly supersaturated with respect to quartz during breakdown of glass to smectite and amphibole. Fluid chemistry in all experiments appears to approach a partial equilibrium state with the albite and anorthite components in plagioclase and approaches a pH consistent with plagioclase alteration to epidote. Trace element data from vent fluids, specifically B and Sr, together with major element chemistry, provides evidence that the reaction zone for black-smoker fluids at mid-ocean ridges is composed of only slightly altered diabase and is characterized by small amounts of epidote, nearly fresh plagioclase and clinopyroxene, and partially to completely hydrated olivine and orthopyroxene. Using equilibrium between plagioclase, the dominant reactant, and epidote, the dominant reaction product in experiments, the authors estimate that temperatures in reaction zones are in excess of 375{degree}C for most vent systems. These temperatures are higher than measured vent temperatures, suggesting that hot spring fluids commonly loose heat during ascent to the sea floor.","","","","","","United States","1989-09-01T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: Geochimica et Cosmochimica Acta; (USA); Journal Volume: 53:9","","Medium: X; Size: Pages: 2283-2300","","","","Journal ID: ISSN 0016-7037; CODEN: GCACA","10.1016/0016-7037(89)90351-7","","2016-04-18T00:00:00Z","7024633","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/7024633","","Geochimica et Cosmochimica Acta; (USA)","","53:9"

The determination of stability constants for the above species results from a critical evaluation of available experimental data. Many experimental studies are inconsistent with each other or, by themselves, lack sufficient quantitative information. However, when used together, the data from a few carefully selected studies yield coherent results. Newly derived stability constants for antimony hydroxide and arsenious acid indicate that, at the sulfide concentrations considered here, these species are generally unimportant relative to sulfide complexes, although they become the dominant arsenic and antimony species at high temperatures in most geothermal systems.","","","","","","United States","1989-09-01T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: Geochimica et Cosmochimica Acta; (USA); Journal Volume: 53:9","","Medium: X; Size: Pages: 2185-2194","","","","Journal ID: ISSN 0016-7037; CODEN: GCACA","10.1016/0016-7037(89)90342-6","","2016-05-16T00:00:00Z","7078648","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/7078648","","Geochimica et Cosmochimica Acta; (USA)","","53:9"

Exploration drilling in the late 1950s down to 1,100 m provided physical information on the system. Petrologic study of drillcore samples recovered from seven wells reveals an alteration assemblage of quartz and albite + adularia, with a variable distribution of chlorite, pyrite, calcite, zeolites, epidote, pyrrhotite, sphene, leucoxene, apatite and minor base metal sulfides; white mica is a late overprint, particularly well developed at shallow depths. The present deep fluids boil adiabatically from at least 300{degree}C to 230{degree}C; at depths of {le}500 m, this ascending chloride fluid is variably diluted by a steam-heated water that lies over, and occurs on the margin of, the system like a discontinuous umbrella; the steam-heated water is relatively CO{sub 2}-rich ({le}0.1 m). The cooling at shallow levels by this mixing has shifted the alteration from albite-adularia stability to white mica stability; this shift is enhanced by the CO{sub 2}-rich nature of the diluent. The shallow portion of the Waiotapu geothermal system has recently evolved, both chemically and physically, by incursion of fluids from a steam-heated carapace. Continued refluxing of these relatively cool, hybrid fluids progressively deeper (with their recycled CO{sub 2} content) will hasten hydrolytic leaching (in contrast to a single pass of adiabatically cooling deep fluids). This action, accompanied by argillic alteration, may eventually seal the deeper portions of the system, hastening its demise. There is evidence for similar events occurring in the fossil environment at epithermal depths.","","","","","","United States","1989-09-01T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: Geochimica et Cosmochimica Acta; (USA); Journal Volume: 53:9","","Medium: X; Size: Pages: 2235-2257","","","","Journal ID: ISSN 0016-7037; CODEN: GCACA","10.1016/0016-7037(89)90347-5","","2016-05-10T00:00:00Z","7078670","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/7078670","","Geochimica et Cosmochimica Acta; (USA)","","53:9"

Correlation algorithms similar to those used to estimate equation of state parameters for ions and electrolytes have also been developed for neutral aqueous species. Calculation of the standard partial molal thermodynamic properties of dissolved inorganic gases as well as other neutral aqueous species as a function of pressure and temperature indicates that the standard partial molal volume ({bar V}{sup 0}), heat capacity ({bar C}{sup 0}{sub P}), and entropy ({bar S}{sup 0}), together with the apparent standard partial molal enthalpy of formation ({Delta}{bar H}{sup 0}) of many of these species in the liquid phase minimize with increasing temperature at P{sub SAT}{sup *} and approach {infinity} at the critical point of H{sub 2}O.

Part 1 presents laboratory work that provides insight and quantitative data on cutter/rock interaction. A cutter-interaction model based on the laboratory results is developed and shown to provide a means for predicting the effects of multiple cutters on a PDC bit face.

(Progressive Optimality Principle) based short-term hydrothermal scheduling algorithm. In a P.O.P. based scheduling algorithm, the trapping phenomenon can severely hinder solution optimality, and thus limits its applicability. The trapping phenomenon is caused by the weak links which break the optimization path into isolated segments, and thus destroy the path continuity required by the P.O.P. based decomposition approach. In order to ensure path continuity, the proposed method identifies and bypasses the potential weak links, such that global optimality can be achieved progressively by successively solving a sequence of two-hour sub-problems. In this paper, examples are used to illustrate the trapping phenomenon and the proposed method.","","","Oklahoma Univ.

REE preferentially partition into the end-member liquids that are rich in network-modifying cations, with two-liquid partition coefficients greater than any other cation. The two-liquid partition coefficients of REE in a given experiment are essentially identical to one another. No evidence was seen to suggest that the solution mechanisms of REE in high-silica liquids vary with differences in their ionic radii. Two-lattice models of trace element solution behavior fail to remove the compositional dependence of REE two-liquid partition coefficients due to the assumption that all network-forming and network-modifying cations mix ideally with one another. As a result, it is probably incorrect to derive physical interpretations from the results of the application of two-lattice models. The results are applied to the origins of the LREE-enriched phenocryst-matrix partition coefficients seen for some ferromagnesian minerals in high-silica rhyolites. Since liquids with extremely high concentrations of T-O-T linkages do not strongly discriminate between the REE on the basis of their ionic radii, the anomalous REE crystal-matrix partition coefficient patterns are best explained as the result of contamination of these minerals by LREE accessory phases.","","","","","","United States","1989-08-01T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: Geochimica et Cosmochimica Acta; (USA); Journal Volume: 53:8","","Medium: X; Size: Pages: 1965-1974","","","","Journal ID: ISSN 0016-7037; CODEN: GCACA","10.1016/0016-7037(89)90317-7","","2016-05-24T00:00:00Z","7170877","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/7170877","","Geochimica et Cosmochimica Acta; (USA)","","53:8"

Most of the wolframite crystals contain two forms of zonation: a physical zonation, observed optically and by electron imaging, and a compositional zonation revealed by X-ray traverses. Compositional zoning is progressive, involving gradual changes in mineral chemistry from core to rim, on which is superimposed a form of oscillatory zoning involving repeated resetting of compositions. Physical zones are layers of uniform width separated by distinct boundaries; they are arranged parallel to crystal faces and reflect intermittent crystal growth. Progressive variation in wolframite chemistry is readily explained in terms of gradually changing physiochemical conditions, such as pH, fO{sub 2}, temperature, pressure and fluid composition, during crystallization. The oscillatory zonation reflects cyclicity of those conditions. Plausible models which could explain such effects include: (a) intermittent mixing of chemically distinct magmatic and meteoric fluids, and (b) repeated hydraulic fracturing and injection of fluids leading to fluctuating pressure and temperature of the hydrothermal fluid. Volatile species (F, Cl, CO{sub 2}) may have been effective as complexing agents thus affecting the supply of Nb from the fluid. Deposition of Nb- and Ta-rich compositions were probably favored by high fO{sub 2}, low pH conditions.","","","","","","United States","1989-08-01T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: Geochimica et Cosmochimica Acta; (USA); Journal Volume: 53:8","","Medium: X; Size: Pages: 1921-1935","","","","Journal ID: ISSN 0016-7037; CODEN: GCACA","10.1016/0016-7037(89)90313-X","","2016-05-30T00:00:00Z","7170881","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/7170881","","Geochimica et Cosmochimica Acta; (USA)","","53:8"

The distinctive, hot, hypersaline brine (typically >20 wt% total dissolved solids) for which the SSGS is known is overlain by a cooler (<260{degree}C) fluid with distinctly lower salinity (typically <10 wt% total dissolved solids). Hypersaline brines have high and rather consistent {sup 18}O shifts produced by water-rock interaction and have a very narrow range in {delta}D values. Low TDS fluids, on the other hand, show a wide range in both {delta}D and {delta}{sup 18}O. production of both types of fluid from closely spaced geothermal wells in many regions of the SSGS indicates that a relatively sharp salinity interface exists over much of the field. The fluid interface typically cross-cuts sedimentary bedding but is consistently found where reservoir temperatures are approximately 260{degree}C. At these temperatures, hypersaline brines have densities of approximately 1.0 gm/cm{sup 3}, while the low TDS fluids have densities as low as 0.85 gm/cm{sup 3}. This stable, density-stratified interface acts as a barrier to convective heat and mass transfer in the SSGS, isolating the hypersaline reservoir from overlying dilute fluids. A lithologic cap implied by previous SSGS models is unnecessary in such a stratified system since heat and mass transfer across the interface must occur by slow conductive, diffusional and interface mixing processes regardless of local permeability.","","","","","","United States","1989-08-01T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: Geochimica et Cosmochimica Acta; (USA); Journal Volume: 53:8","","Medium: X; Size: Pages: 1905-1920","","","","Journal ID: ISSN 0016-7037; CODEN: GCACA","10.1016/0016-7037(89)90312-8","","2016-05-30T00:00:00Z","7170890","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/7170890","","Geochimica et Cosmochimica Acta; (USA)","","53:8"

LEQ is a good approximation if an initial disequilibrium condition relaxes to an equilibrium state over a distance and time period that is less than the spatial and temporal scales-of-interest. These scales-of-interest depend on the particular problem under investigation and include the hundreds of meters scale for field investigations, the sub-meter scale for laboratory investigations and the sub-crystal scale. An equation representing the scale-of-interest and describing advective, diffusive and dispersive transport coupled with irreversible heterogeneous reaction is derived and analytically solved for a single component (silica), monomineralic (quartz), one-dimensional system. Typically, t{sub eq} {approx} 1 year and l{sub eq} {approx} 10 m for sedimentary basins; t{sub eq} {approx} 3 days and l{sub eq} {approx} 10 mm for host rocks in magma-hydrothermal systems; t{sub eq} {approx} 10 hours and l{sub eq} = 250 {mu}m for regional metamorphic environments; t{sub eq} {approx} 1 year and l{sub eq} {approx} 100 m for injection wells; t{sub eq} {approx} 700 years and l{sub eq} {approx} 75 km for laboratory core flow experiments. These values depend on the specifics of each environment and can vary over orders of magnitudes. LEQ is a good approximation if t{sub eq} and l{sub eq} are less than the scales-of-interest. This analysis, though quantitative, is only approximate because it does not include the effects of competing heterogeneous reactions. These effects result in over-estimation of t{sub eq} and l{sub eq} for low temperatures silicate environments and under-estimation of t{sub eq} and l{sub eq} for high temperature environments.","","","","","","United States","1989-08-01T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: Geochimica et Cosmochimica Acta; (USA); Journal Volume: 53:8","","Medium: X; Size: Pages: 1955-1964","","","","Journal ID: ISSN 0016-7037; CODEN: GCACA","10.1016/0016-7037(89)90316-5","","2016-04-19T00:00:00Z","7170871","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/7170871","","Geochimica et Cosmochimica Acta; (USA)","","53:8"

As the proportion of internal heating increases, the number of upwelling plumes increases, and downwelling sheets become more vigorous and time-dependent. With any amount of basal heating, the entire convective pattern, during its evolution, is anchored to the upwelling plumes. As the proportion of internal heating increases, the heat flow carried by the upwelling plumes remains a large fraction of the basal heat flow. Downwelling sheets carry only a minor fraction (approximately 30%) of the basal heat flow (even when the shell is entirely heated from below), but they advect almost all of the internally generated heat. The relatively large number of plumes in the Earth's mantle (inferred from hotspots), the possibility that downwelling slabs are vigorous enough to penetrate the lower mantle, and the small fraction of terrestrial surface heat flow carried by plumes all suggest that the mantle is predominantly heated from within. /copyright/ American Geophysical Union 1989","","","Department of Earth and Space Sciences, University of California, Los Angeles (US); Earth and Space Sciences Division, Los Alamos National Laboratory","","","United States","1989-07-01T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: Geophys.

In this paper, conservation laws are used to derive equations for the isotope transport in a porous medium; these are combined with fluid flow equations and a simple equation describing the rate of oxygen isotope exchange between the water and the rock.

Drilling fluids must be circulated to cool them and prevent conversion to steam. Cement designs must be special. Likewise, if a geothermal well blows out, the techniques to kill it are different than those used to control oil and gas wells. The difficulties are increased if the blowing well is shallow. This was the case when Ormat's 14-6 well blew out near Fallon, Nevada, last January. The well was drilled using the same drilling program followed on other field wells. However, an unexpected fault caused severe lost circulation, and eventually, the well blew out. The operator, Ormat Energy Sytems, Inc., which had an impeccable record for safety and efficiently run operations, immediately responded to the situation by calling in Houston's Neal Adams Firefighters,. Control operations were directed by team leader, Neal Adeams. The nature of the problems required a combination of surface and subsurface control techniques.

The authors discuss how the advances in electronic instrumentation and computer science have brought about an evolution in the detection of tracers and analysis of tracer tests. Most oil field tracer applications require downhold detection via wireline conveyed instruments; thus, the use of gamma-ray emitting radioactive isotopes is quite common.

The fossil discharge zones are elongate areas of alteration and mineralization characterized by numerous small (meters to tens of meters in length), linear, discontinuous gossans. The gossans result from oxidation of hydrothermal pyrite replacing primary igneous phases and filling voids and fractures in the altered host rocks. The two deposits have separate discharge zones that appear to be sub-sea-floor extensions of their stockworks. The Bayda zone extends through the volcanic section into the upper sheeted dike complex and is interpreted as having formed on the ridge crest above an axial magma chamber; the Aarja zone terminates against a plagiogranite pluton that intrudes the lower volcanic section and is thought to have formed after Bayda in an off-axis environment. Structural, stratigraphic, and compositional characteristics of the Bayda and Aarja massive sulfide bodies are consistent with this interpretation. The geometry of the discharge zones suggests that in both cases upflow occurred in broad zones (at least 400-600 m wide) that were elongated along strike (i.e., parallel to the spreading axis).","","","","","","United States","1989-06-01T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: Geology; (USA); Journal Volume: 17:6","","Medium: X; Size: Pages: 531-535","","","","Journal ID: ISSN 0091-7613; CODEN: GLGYB","10.1130/0091-7613(1989)017<0531:HDZBMS>2.3.CO;2","","2016-05-16T00:00:00Z","7012858","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/7012858","","Geology; (USA)","","17:6"

Gravity effects were shown to affect the pressure transients significantly because of the large difference in the densities of liquid water and vapor. Production from such systems enhances steam/liquid-water counterflow and expands the vapor-dominated zone at the top of the reservoir. Subcooled liquid regions develop in the center of the reservoir as a result of gravity drainage of cooler liquid water. The vapor zone acts as a constant-pressure boundary and helps to stabilize the pressure decline in the system. The pressure transients at observation wells were shown to depend greatly on the location (depth) of the major feed zone; if this is not accounted for, large errors in deduced reservoir properties will result.

To assess the impact of these hydrothermal inputs on ocean chemistry, the authors have examined he behavior of REEs for hydrothermal sediments collected adjacent to two Pacific spreading ridge sites: the East Pacific Rise at 19{degree}S, and the Southern Juan de Fuca Ridge at 45{degree}N. In general, the REE/Fe ratios for both proximal and distal hydrothermal sediments are greater than vent solutions by a factor of 2 to 500, and these ratios increase with increasing distance away from the ridge axis. An evaluation of these results in the context of previous models of REE behavior indicates that, in fact, seawater experiences a net depletion in REEs as a result of hydrothermal activity. This is due primarily to the large scavenging capacity of iron oxyhydroxides which precipitate from these solutions. Such an interpretation explains why the REE content of seawater collected in the vicinity of hydrothermal vents is anomalously lower than normal seawater sampled from a comparable depth.","","","","","","United States","1989-03-01T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: Geochimica et Cosmochimica Acta; (USA); Journal Volume: 53:3","","Medium: X; Size: Pages: 757-762","","","","Journal ID: ISSN 0016-7037; CODEN: GCACA","10.1016/0016-7037(89)90019-7","","2016-05-16T00:00:00Z","5163744","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/5163744","","Geochimica et Cosmochimica Acta; (USA)","","53:3"

While the primary responsibility for furthering solar usage remains with the legislatures, both federal and state, a significant role remains for the courts. This role appears to have been largely overlooked in the past. The crucial question is whether the courts are prepared to seize the initiative and exercise the role available to them. As the relevant case law shows, the present evidence is inconclusive. Some courts have sought to advance the cause of solar energy on grounds of public policy, while other courts have ignored the policy arguments and applied a technical legal analysis to the detriment of the solar user. This article attempt to point the way forward for the courts and embolden them in the need to safeguard solar access and advance the use of solar energy. If this is to occur, however, the courts must show the reforming zeal that has characterized the development of the common law, particularly in the United States, at various times in the past.","","","","","","United States","1989-01-01T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: Journal of Energy Law and Policy; (USA); Journal Volume: 9:2","","Medium: X; Size: Pages: 135-175","","","","Journal ID: ISSN 0275-9926; CODEN: JELPE","","","2009-12-16T00:00:00Z","5231646","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/5231646","","Journal of Energy Law and Policy; (USA)","","9:2"

The model accommodates the essential mechanisms of permeability enhancement or degradation resulting from injection of fluid at a temperature different from ambient. The effects of induced thermal strains and fluid pressures in conditioning both normal and shear displacements in an ubiquitously jointed continuum are accommodated. The mass is idealized as a blocky assemblage where diffusive-advective energy transport in the fracture system is augmented by transient heat supply from intact rock blocks. The true transient nature of both energy supply from the blocks to the percolating fluid and the development of thermal strains within the medium are determined analytically. The local assumption of full lateral restraint coupled with analytical representation of thermal strains renders the nonlinear initial-value problem fully defined in terms of the two dependent variables of fluid pressure and fluid temperature only. Subject to these assumptions, complete fluid-pressure and fluid-temperature histories of large, thermally stimulated reservoirs may be determined effectively and efficiently. Results are presented for both single point injection and dual point injection-withdrawal scenarios to illustrate the possible scope of the method.","","","","","","United States","1989-01-01T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: Geothermics (International Journal of Geothermal Research and its Applications); (UK); Journal Volume: 18:5/6","","Medium: X; Size: Pages: 691-710","","","","Journal ID: ISSN 0375-6505; CODEN: GTMCA","","","2009-12-16T00:00:00Z","5795057","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/5795057","","Geothermics (International Journal of Geothermal Research and its Applications); (UK)","","18:5/6"

Scale types investigated included carbonate minerals, amorphous silicates, and mixed metal oxides and sulfides. Scale formation was reported to occur in geothermal systems under a wide range of enthalpy and chemical conditions. The predominant factors found to control the solubility of scale-forming minerals include changes in temperature and pH with lesser control being exerted by the concentrations of other ionic species and by kinetic effects. The range of conditions under which scale mineral formation occurs has resulted in the deposition of these minerals throughout the geothermal utilization system including production wells, surface equipment, and wastewater reinjection wells. Chemical and engineering methods applied to the treatment of scale-forming minerals during extraction of geothermal heat included the addition of chemical inhibitors, control of fluid pressures and temperatures, and mechanical and chemical removal of deposited scale minerals.

Retarding and accelerating effects of aluminium on the growth of polysilicic acid particles and on the reaction between monosilicic acid and polysilicic acid were observed by changing the pH. It is suggested that the accelerating effect on the reaction between polysilicic acid particles is due to the formation of aluminium hydroxide on the surface of polysilicic acid. The rate of decrease in the monosilicic acid concentration in the presence of aluminium was faster than that in the absence of aluminium at pH 9, because monosilicic acid could be adsorbed rapidly on the aluminium hydroxide. From the results it is presumed that the formation of aluminium hydroxide on the solid surface may accelerate the deposition of silicic acid from geothermal water.","","","","","","United States","1989-01-01T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: Geothermics; (USA); Journal Volume: 18:1","","Medium: X; Size: Pages: 321-325","","","","Journal ID: ISSN 0375-6505; CODEN: GTMCA","10.1016/0375-6505(89)90042-4","","2016-05-27T00:00:00Z","5276043","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/5276043","","Geothermics; (USA)","","18:1"

Downhole injection was performed at about 750 m depth using a 4.6 mm 0D flexible pipe freely lowered in the 9 5/'' casing and with total flow rates of 300 t/h for three months.","","","","","","United States","1989-01-01T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: Geothermics; (USA); Journal Volume: 18:1","","Medium: X; Size: Pages: 249-257","","","","Journal ID: ISSN 0375-6505; CODEN: GTMCA","10.1016/0375-6505(89)90034-5","","2016-04-19T00:00:00Z","5276076","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/5276076","","Geothermics; (USA)","","18:1"

After two or three years of exploitation of the geothermal doublets in the northern part of the Paris basin, scaling and plugging problems have appeared in some cases. The results of the detailed study carried out at La Courneuve Nord, a typical site of this area, are presented. The drawdown of production rate, scaling in the heat exchanger and the increase of injection pressure required a rapid decision for workover operations on the wells. These cleaning operations and joint research studies allowed the authors to identify the cause of the plugging as well as to locate these deposits and to estimate their importance. After cleaning operations, the hydraulic properties of the reservoir seem to be recovered. Chemical and mineralogical analyses of these deposits identified the presence of a large variety of iron sulfide and a typical corrosion product. Biochemical and bacteriological studies show a very high content of micro-organisms. A chemical model, IPDEGAZ, is used to calculate the evolution of the saturation indexes of the fluid with respect to iron sulfide phases. The effects of parameters such as pressure, temperature, degassing and addition of iron by corrosion are simulated. The results of the observation and modeling approaches are compared.","","","","","","United States","1989-01-01T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: Geothermics; (USA); Journal Volume: 18:1","","Medium: X; Size: Pages: 137-144","","","","Journal ID: ISSN 0375-6505; CODEN: GTMCA","10.1016/0375-6505(89)90020-5","","2016-05-02T00:00:00Z","5276149","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/5276149","","Geothermics; (USA)","","18:1"

Soundings were made over 4-6 decades of period from 0.01s. In this paper, the results of the University of Edinburgh group, involving 37 soundings, are presented. Special care was taken over data acquisition in the so-called dead band so that the resulting magnetotelluric responses were of good quality. The application of several dimensionality tests showed that the data were predominantly one dimensional except at the longest periods. Electrical resistivity models were derived from the application of several 1-D modelling procedures and for sites close to the boreholes M-1, M-2 and M-3 the resulting models were compared with the borehole data. The Dawes and Parker D+ algorithms were the most successful in revealing an interface at the reservoir depth at all three boreholes and, as a result, were used in the subsequent collation of 1-D models along a number of traverses. For interpretation of the longer period data, some 2-D modelling was also undertaken and is presented here in pseudo-3-D form.","","","","","","United States","1989-01-01T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: Geothermics; (USA); Journal Volume: 18:4","","Medium: X; Size: Pages: 521-532","","","","Journal ID: ISSN 0375-6505; CODEN: GTMCA","10.1016/0375-6505(89)90054-0","","2016-05-24T00:00:00Z","5276980","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/5276980","","Geothermics; (USA)","","18:4"

The heated fresh water will mix with low-temperature geothermal water in the distribution system in Reykjavik. A pilot plant has been set up to investigate magnesium silicate scale formation when mixing of these waters occurs. Tests show that the scale formation is dependent on the severity of deaeration of the fresh water the proportion of geothermal water in the mixture. Increased deaeration and thermal water proportion increase the pH of the mixture, and this promotes scaling. The scale formed is poorly crystalline, near amorphous trioctahedral smectite close to saponite in composition. By using minimum deaeration and traces of geothermal steam to remove the last remaining dissolved oxygen, scaling in the distribution system can be avoided.","","","","","","United States","1989-01-01T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: Geothermics; (USA); Journal Volume: 18:1","","Medium: X; Size: Pages: 113-120","","","","Journal ID: ISSN 0375-6505; CODEN: GTMCA","10.1016/0375-6505(89)90017-5","","2016-04-15T00:00:00Z","5323535","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/5323535","","Geothermics; (USA)","","18:1"

Scaling problems have only occurred in a few cases during exploitation. The most severe cases are due to precipitation of calcium carbonate in brackish water and occur both in downhole pumps and surface installations. In plants heating fresh water scaling by magnesium silicate has occurred. In the high-temperature geothermal fields calcium carbonate precipitation in wells is not uncommon but occurs at shallow levels and is amended by reaming the wells at regular intervals. Silica scaling in waste water is a general problem in most of the fields, but is mostly avoided inside the plants and in the distribution piping. Aluminium-silicates have been troublesome where the high-temperature waters have been used directly for heating as they are precipitated at temperatures well above saturation with opaline silica at which point the onset of scaling was expected. From the brine in the Reykjanes field there have been encountered downhole scales of iron-magnesium-silicates, and metalsulfide with high contents of precious metals is precipitated at the wellhead of one of the wells, Rn-9. Iron-silicates were precipitated from the magnetic influenced geothermal fluid in the Krafla field and metallic sulfides and oxides were also present in the scales blocking the wells at that time.","","","","","","United States","1989-01-01T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: Geothermics; (USA); Journal Volume: 18:1","","Medium: X; Size: Pages: 183-190","","","","Journal ID: ISSN 0375-6505; CODEN: GTMCA","10.1016/0375-6505(89)90026-6","","2016-04-14T00:00:00Z","5322943","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/5322943","","Geothermics; (USA)","","18:1"

Long-term tests have been carried out to study reservoir characteristics. The change in the production behavior of the wells with the restriction imposed by the deposited calcite has been studied trying to evaluate and quantify the scaling problem. Work is being done on predictions of the deposition rate, location and distribution of the deposited mineral inside the wells. This work was compared with real data obtained from caliper logs of the wells before and after production. The feasibility of the first 55 MW power plant has been demonstrated. It was considered that the solution for the calcite problem is the reaming during discharge of the wells trying at the same time to minimize the cleaning interventions with a new well design. It is believed, due to the thermodynamics and chemical characteristics of the extracted fluids, that it is possible to find a non-deposition zone which will permit the drilling of wells without a scaling problem.","","","","","","United States","1989-01-01T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: Geothermics; (USA); Journal Volume: 18:1","","Medium: X; Size: Pages: 305-312","","","","Journal ID: ISSN 0375-6505; CODEN: GTMCA","10.1016/0375-6505(89)90040-0","","2016-04-08T00:00:00Z","5322967","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/5322967","","Geothermics; (USA)","","18:1"

At the Reykanes Geo-Chemicals plant deposition of silica was a serious problem. After acidification of brine to pH 2.5 before evaporation the silica can be kept in solution for a considerable time. In order to precipitate silica out of this brine caustic soda is added. To get an effective precipitation of silica, a pH of at least 8.2 has to be reached. By using an electromagnetic field, a pH of 7.3-7.8 is sufficient to precipitate silica and an increased settling rate is observed. Settling rates were found to be from 7.1-9.7 cm/min at 100{sup 0}C and from 3.4-4.6 cm/min at 40{sup 0}C, compared to 1.3 cm/min for silica which was only alkalized.

Some waters with high temperatures may be undersaturated. Boiling causes a drastic decrease in CO/sub 2/ partial pressures which leads to supersaturation and calcite precipitation. The supersaturation reaches maximum soon after boiling is initiated. At this maximum the water has been almost quantitatively degassed. Further boiling, which leads to cooling, will cause successively decreasing supersaturation as the solubility of calcite increases with decreasing temperature. The magnitude of supersaturation is largely controlled by the initial temperature and the salinity of the geothermal water, being highest when salinity is highest and temperature lowest. Calcite deposition tends to be troublesome only when the first level of boiling is in the well. When extensive boiling starts in the aquifer, calcite precipitation is not experienced although it is expected to occur in the formation. The pore volume in the reservoir is much larger than that of individual wellbores and can cope with calcite deposition without observable deterioration of permeability for periods as long as the lifetime (20-50 years) of individual wells.","","","","","","United States","1989-01-01T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: Geothermics; (USA); Journal Volume: 18:1","","Medium: X; Size: Pages: 33-39","","","","Journal ID: ISSN 0375-6505; CODEN: GTMCA","10.1016/0375-6505(89)90007-2","","2016-05-20T00:00:00Z","5322376","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/5322376","","Geothermics; (USA)","","18:1"

Raw BHT data are, on the average, cooler than true formation temperatures. To estimate true formation temperatures, corrections must be applied. Empirical BHT corrections may be applied to BHT data for which only depths of measurement are known, but may not be valid outside of the area for which they are calibrated. If multiple BHT measurements from successive logging runs are available, the Horner plot correction procedure can be used. The accuracy of the Horner plot is limited by simplifying assumptions made in its derivation, and by the common lack of information on parameters such as duration of mud circulation. More detailed and complete treatments provide insight into the borehole equilibration process, but their application is similarly limited by a common lack of data regarding borehole thermal properties. A new type of empirical correction procedure may be derived in some areas and allows a correction to be made for BHTs for which only a depth and time of measurement are known.","","","","","","United States","1989-01-01T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: Geothermics (International Journal of Geothermal Research and its Applications); (UK); Journal Volume: 18:5/6","","Medium: X; Size: Pages: 775-790","","","","Journal ID: ISSN 0375-6505; CODEN: GTMCA","10.1016/0375-6505(89)90106-5","","2016-05-16T00:00:00Z","5794964","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/5794964","","Geothermics (International Journal of Geothermal Research and its Applications); (UK)","","18:5/6"

The deep fluid has a temperature of at least 250--300{degrees} C, and an inferred chloride concentration of 1400--1600 mg/kg. Apart from fumarolic areas near the summits of the two volcanoes, most thermal activity occurs at low elevation along the two main outflow paths towards the coast. The hot spring waters of downtown Beppu have originated from outflow along the Asamigawa Fault, with their chemistry indicating predominantly dilution of the deep fluid by groundwater. The second outflow zone towards the hot spring area of downtown Kamegawa coincides with a ridge of lavas. Here boiling, steam loss, and subsequent mixing with steam-heated groundwaters have significantly modified both the deep fluid and host rocks. The area of the geothermal system above 200{degrees} C is at least 15 km{sup 2} at sea level, and the total natural heat output is inferred to be at least 250 MW.

However, severe reinjection problems at the Melleray geothermal exploitation, near Orleans, have delayed the use of such aquifers in France. A fluid with a TDS of 35g/l at 72{sup 0}C tapped by the production well of Melleray has been carefully studied. The reinjection problems are mainly due to gas bubbles and solid particles clogging the pores of the sandstones. In order to establish a fluid treatment with a view to reinjection, a small-scale pilot plant has been designed. This pilot plant enables several physical and chemical fluid treatment procedures to be tested. Degassing of the fluid looks particularly favorable to avoid rapid clogging by gas bubbles. However this process may induce carbonate scaling, especially as the geothermal fluid at depth is in chemical equilibrium with respect to calcite. In the case of fluid degassing, the scaling potential has been evaluated, using the computer code TPDEGAZ. It is shown that an appropriate choice of exploitation scheme combined with the use of crystal growth inhibitors would allow exploitation of the Melleray geothermal resource.","","","","","","United States","1989-01-01T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: Geothermics; (USA); Journal Volume: 18:1","","Medium: X; Size: Pages: 313-320","","","","Journal ID: ISSN 0375-6505; CODEN: GTMCA","10.1016/0375-6505(89)90041-2","","2016-05-12T00:00:00Z","5415494","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/5415494","","Geothermics; (USA)","","18:1"

The chemical reaction of the circulation fluid with the reservoir rock may lead to the undesirable corrosion or scaling of the reservoir itself, or associated engineering structures. Two potential circulation fluids for use in a high temperature (200{sup 0}C) HDR system in granite in SW England, are a dilute groundwater, and a modified seawater composition. The reaction of these fluids with granite has been evaluated experimentally, with particular emphasis upon the characterization of solid precipitates. Secondary solids associated with the reaction of groundwater with granite consist of clay and Ca-zeolite. Product fluids were alkaline, of low salinity and were relatively benign for heat exchange purposes. Chemical analysis of precipitated clay by analytical transmission electron microscopy reveal a range of composition between illite and smectite. The precipitation of MHSH and clay is instrumental in governing the low pH of the product fluid, which would pose problems concerning the corrosion of pumps, heat exchangers, etc in a possible HDR geothermal system. The suitability of each of the potential heat exchange fluids may be linked to their initial Mg contents.","","","","","","United States","1989-01-01T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: Geothermics; (USA); Journal Volume: 18:1","","Medium: X; Size: Pages: 233-240","","","","Journal ID: ISSN 0375-6505; CODEN: GTMCA","10.1016/0375-6505(89)90032-1","","2016-05-27T00:00:00Z","5415545","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/5415545","","Geothermics; (USA)","","18:1"

It has recently been discovered in superheated steam in exploited geothermal systems, usually as a result of HCl-induced corrosion of well casing and steam gathering systems. Evaluation of four geothermal system which produce Cl-bearing steam provides evidence for the presence of Cl as HCl and the natural reservoir conditions which can produce HCl-bearing steam. Theoretical calculations defining the physical and chemical conditions of the reservoir liquid which can produce HCI-bearing steam are presented. The main factors are pH, temperature and Cl concentration. Lower pH, higher temperature and higher chlorinity allow more HCl to be volatized with steam. In order to reach the surface in steam, the HCl cannot contact liquid water in which it is more soluble, essentially limiting transport to superheated steam. Temperature, pH and Cl concentration of reservoir liquids in each of the geothermal systems evaluated combine differently to produce HCl-bearing steam.","","","","","","United States","1989-01-01T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: Geothermics; (USA); Journal Volume: 18:1","","Medium: X; Size: Pages: 295-304","","","","Journal ID: ISSN 0375-6505; CODEN: GTMCA","10.1016/0375-6505(89)90039-4","","2016-04-07T00:00:00Z","5415650","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/5415650","","Geothermics; (USA)","","18:1"

The island is mainly volcanic. It belongs to the Aegean Active Arc, within which the Milos archipelago shows the most important volcanism in terms of quantity, variety of products and duration of activity (3.5-0.8 M.a.). There are no large central volcanic edifices but different, frequently coeval eruption centres. The initial and intermediate phases of activity were mainly pyroclastic and submarine, whereas the last one (0.1 M.a.) was subaerial and formed tuff rings, surge deposits and lava flows, all of homogenous rhyolitic composition. Recent detailed studies have addressed the mechanism of feeding and the type of magmatic chambers beneath Milos. Distention tectonics have two main phases: an earlier one (Pliocene) with NE-SW direction and a much more intense recent (Quaternary) one, trending NW-SE. The geological, tectonic and magmatic activity favoured the formation of a high enthalpy geothermal field. Many fossil and active thermal manifestations exist: hot springs, fumaroles, hot grounds, phreatic explosion craters. The hydrothermal alteration of the volcanites produced, by self sealing, a perfect cover for the geothermal fluids. Geothermometry of the surface fluids indicated high values for the source temperatures and very high geothermal gradients in central and eastern Milos. Geothermally anomalous zones, defined by two different methods, together with superficial geological and tectonic information, permitted the location of sites for deep drilling. Five exploratory wells 1000-1400m deep gave satisfactory results of flow rate (40-120 t/h), temperature (300-320{sup 0}C) and enthalpy.","","","","","","United States","1989-01-01T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: Geothermics; (USA); Journal Volume: 18:4","","Medium: X; Size: Pages: 485-496","","","","Journal ID: ISSN 0375-6505; CODEN: GTMCA","10.1016/0375-6505(89)90051-5","","2016-04-14T00:00:00Z","5416312","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/5416312","","Geothermics; (USA)","","18:4"

Since the data show this activity to be confined to depths greater than 4 km, their spatial distribution cannot help to delineate directly features of the shallow geothermal reservoir which has been proven by drilling. An array of up to 30 simultaneously operating three-component tape-recording seismometers allowed detection of anomalies in the propagation of waves from these sources on their path to the surface through domains which may contain reservoirs. Clear and strong anisotropy was demonstrated by shear-wave splitting, which may be attributed tentatively to oriented fluid-filled microcracks or fracture systems. The density of observation points and different positions of source regions allowed strong changes to be documented. A change with depth of the type of velocity anomaly may indicate a change in fracture density and liquid saturation. The distribution of seismicity and type of heterogeneity and anisotropy are discussed in terms of phase transitions in geothermal fluids in different states of confinement and in terms of the variation of mechanical behaviour and phase transition on approaching a possible heat source at depth.","","","","","","United States","1989-01-01T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: Geothermics; (USA); Journal Volume: 18:4","","Medium: X; Size: Pages: 579-595","","","","Journal ID: ISSN 0375-6505; CODEN: GTMCA","10.1016/0375-6505(89)90058-8","","2016-05-26T00:00:00Z","5416327","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/5416327","","Geothermics; (USA)","","18:4"

The effects of pH, temperature and time (of pH change) on surface area and pore volume were studied. Depending on the conditions a surface area of 20-500 m/sup 2//g and pre volume up to 3 cm/sup 3//g could be obtained. Higher pH and temperature were found to aid the aggregation process. Allowing the polymerization to proceed for some time before increasing pH resulted in faster aggregation and a larger surface area than would have been reached if the pH had been increased at once.

The authors conducted a study to evaluate the geochemical effects of this process. Computer modelling using EQ3/6 permitted comparison of mineral preciptiation/dissolution effects between SRWW and two current injectates: produced steam condensate, and meteoric water from Big Sulfur Creek (BSCW). A conceptual model involving injectate propagation, heat transfer, and chemical processes provides the framework for evaluating simulation results. Computer modeling indicates that, prior to substantial boiling, injection of any of the liquids examined can result in a net porosity increase. This result reflects the fact that in each case modeled volume of dissolved quartz exceed modeled precipitate mineral volumes. Several questions must be addressed to evaluate the applicability of this conclusion. Foremost among these are: the availability of quartz within fractures, the rate of injectate heating, the kinetics of mineral precipitation/dissolution reactions, and the nature of suspended solids deposition.","","","","","","United States","1989-01-01T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: Geothermics; (USA); Journal Volume: 18:1","","Medium: X; Size: Pages: 65-72","","","","Journal ID: ISSN 0375-6505; CODEN: GTMCA","10.1016/0375-6505(89)90011-4","","2016-04-08T00:00:00Z","5416076","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/5416076","","Geothermics; (USA)","","18:1"

Six types of clay scales are identified, but the predominant one, comprising 60-100% of the clay deposits in a well, is Mg- and Fe-rich and referred to as a vermiculitic species. The crystallinity, degree of disorder, textures, optical characteristics, structure and relative amounts of structural Al, Mg and Fe vary with time, temperature and fluid composition, but not with depth and measured pressure.

While high-temperature fluids tend to deposit metal sulfides because of their high concentrations of dissolved metals and variations of temperature, pressure and fluid chemistry, low temperature media are characterized by very low metal content but much higher dissolved sulfide. In the case of the goethermal wells of the Paris Basin, detailed studies demonstrate that the relatively large concentrations of chloride and dissolved sulfide are responsible for corrosion and consequent formation of iron sulfide scale composed of mackinawite, pyrite and pyrrhotite. The effects of the exploitation schemes are far less important than the corrosion of the casings. The low-enthalpy fluids that do not originate from sedimentary aquifers (such as in Iceland and Bulgaria), have a limited corrosion potential, and the thin sulfide film that appears may prevent the progress of corrosion.","","","","","","United States","1989-01-01T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: Geothermics; (USA); Journal Volume: 18:1","","Medium: X; Size: Pages: 73-81","","","","Journal ID: ISSN 0375-6505; CODEN: GTMCA","10.1016/0375-6505(89)90012-6","","2016-04-25T00:00:00Z","5385965","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/5385965","","Geothermics; (USA)","","18:1"

Estimated times between scale cleanouts should be 3 to 4 months for wells with 22.44 cm production casing and 6 to 12 months for wells with 31.53 cm casing.","","","","","","United States","1989-01-01T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: Geothermics; (USA); Journal Volume: 18:1","","Medium: X; Size: Pages: 41-48","","","","Journal ID: ISSN 0375-6505; CODEN: GTMCA","10.1016/0375-6505(89)90008-4","","2016-04-18T00:00:00Z","5386020","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/5386020","","Geothermics; (USA)","","18:1"

The distribution and geochemistry behavior of Mn, Fe, Cu, Zn, P and Ba indicate a hydrothermal influence: (i) at plate boundaries such as the Pliny and Strabon Trenches; (ii) in fore-arc basins such as Maleas, Iraklion and Karpathos; (iii) on the Island Arc. All fore-arc basins having greater Mn enrichments than the trenches are also characterized by higher heat flow values. The greatest Mn enrichments occur at Maleas Basin where a Mn dispersion halo is recognized. This basin is very tectonically active, with the largest group of normal faults, along the planes of which magmatic material was injected, and the highest heat flow values in the Sea of Crete. It also falls in the Eastern Mediterranean Zone of high seismic activity. Because the Fe-Mn sediments identified in the above geotectonic units are the end-members of the hydrothermal fractionation sequence known from areas where leaching of oceanic crust occurs, it is suggested that other members of the sequence such as metal sulfides may be found. Significant geochemical anomalies of Pb and Zn found in areas of high heat flow and on lines of normal faulting are considered to be traces of the presence of metal sulfides.","","","","","","United States","1989-01-01T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: Geochimica et Cosmochimica Acta; (USA); Journal Volume: 53:1","","Medium: X; Size: Pages: 43-57","","","","Journal ID: ISSN 0016-7037; CODEN: GCACA","10.1016/0016-7037(89)90271-8","","2016-05-30T00:00:00Z","7262279","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/7262279","","Geochimica et Cosmochimica Acta; (USA)","","53:1"

Vertical profiles of temperature, pressures and phase saturations in steady-state conditions are obtained by numerically integrating the coupled ordinary differential equations describing conservation of water, CO/sub 2/ and energy. Solutions, including binary diffusion effects in the gas phase, are generated for cases with net mass throughflow as well as for balanced liquid-vapor counterflow. Calculated examples illustrate some fundamental characteristics of two-phase heat transmission systems with non-condensible gas.","","","","","","United States","1989-01-01T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: Geothermics; (USA); Journal Volume: 18:3","","Medium: X; Size: Pages: 367-375","","","","Journal ID: ISSN 0375-6505; CODEN: GTMCA","10.1016/0375-6505(89)90063-1","","2016-04-14T00:00:00Z","5416452","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/5416452","","Geothermics; (USA)","","18:3"
