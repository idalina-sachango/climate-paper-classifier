The United States also sought injunctive relief and damages. On a defense motion to dismiss for failure to state a claim upon which relief could be granted, and on a countermotion of the United States for summary judgment, the District Court, George B. Harris, Senior Judge, held that (1) what passed under a Stock Raising Homestead Act patent was fee title, not just the surface estate with a reservation of the subsurface, and (2) the Act's reservation of ''coal and other minerals'' to the United States did not include a reservation of geothermal steam and associated geothermal resources, since they are not ''minerals'' within the meaning of the reservation of the Act and the patents granted thereunder.","","","","","","United States","1973-01-01T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: Fed.

In some areas, the geothermal reservoir produces natural dry steam that can be brought to the surface and introduced directly into the turbine. In other areas, geothermal fluids (superheated and under pressure) are brought to the surface; a portion of the fluid flashes into steam, which is used to drive the turbine. The geothermal energy percentage of total national electrical power capacity by 2000 is estimated variously at 1 percent to 20 percent or more. The ultimate capacities of the Geysers field, the Imperial Valley area, and the Mono Lake/Long Valley area, Calif., are estimated to be 1000 to 5000, 3000 to 30,000, and 1750 Mw, respectively.","","","","","","United States","1974-02-01T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: Instrum.

This literature study is based on a survey of the literature and discussions with individuals knowledgeable on various aspects of the subject. This report examines the potential of the domestic geothermal mineral resources, considers the technical problems involved, and outlines possible effects on the environment from reservoir fluid withdrawal and reinjection. Geothermal resources in the western U.S. were extensively explored during the 1960s. Limited development operations included exploratory drilling and operating wells producing hot brine, separating steam for experimental electric power generation, and recovering minerals in solar evaporation ponds or in extraction plants. Interest in the recovery of minerals and salts from geothermal fluids waned because of corrosion and scaling problems and low or no market value of the mineral products. Most of these problems can be controlled with existing technology and careful planning of processes and equipment.

"Simulation of geyser systems","Merzhanov, A G; Steynberg, A S; Steynberg, G S","15 GEOTHERMAL ENERGY; GEYSERS; SEISMIC EFFECTS; SIMULATION; EQUILIBRIUM; FLUID FLOW; STRUCTURAL MODELS; 150200* - Geology & Hydrology of Geothermal Systems","The system is shown to be in a nonequilibrium metastable stage before the liquid ejection; in P-T coordinates, the liquid in the working chamber of the geyser has a temperature appreciably above that corresponding to the pressure in the chamber. The equilibrium is restored during the ejection, but it again is disrupted afterwards. A study has been made of the response of a geyser model to seismic effects, and it has been found that the metastability of the liquid in the system is due to the high sensitivity of the geyser state to seismic vibrations. Cavitation arises in the superheated liquid in response to the weak seismic vibrations, which leads to ejection. The relationship between the superheating and the threshold seismic energy for ejection is derived, and it is found that a linear temperature increase in the working chamber corresponds to exponential fall in the seismic energy necessary to initiate an ejection. A physical explanation has been given for the reported change in the natural period of a geyser before strong earth tremors in the adjacent region. It is found that the increase in the stress concentration in the crust regularly influences the natural period of the geyser. The trend can be used for seismic forecasting.","","","Volcanology Inst., Moscow","","","United States","1974-01-01T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: Geochem.

The integral and welded specimens were quenched in water from 1000, 980, 1000, 1000, 1080 C. The pH of the water was reduced by adding HCl. In seawater, corrosion was local: failure arose mainly under the acorn barnacles--about 85 percent. No intercrystalline corrosion was observed. Except in the case of /sup 21/Cr/sup 6/Ni/sup 2/MoTi, which was 2-3 times more stable owing to presence of molybdenum, the corrosion of the integral specimens differed little. Increasing the carbon content of steel /sup 21/Cr/sup 5/Ni from 0.04 to 0.12 percent led to about a 15 percent increase in corrosion, reduction of nickel to 3 percent did not affect the stability of the steel. Chemical composition had a more marked influence in the welded specimens. The corrosion of the welded specimens was 1.5-2 times greater than that of the integral ones. There were no grounds for intensification of corrosion under the acorn barnacles of any of the zones in question. Thus, the pH at which there was a sudden marked shift of the potential toward the negative and the potentials at these pH values for the bulk metal, the zone near the seam and the weld seam were fairly close together. From the observed characteristics we cannot explain the greater corrosion of welded specimens in comparison with the integral ones. This phenomenon is due to the fact that under seawater the weld seam, owing to the rough surface, crevices rapidly arise, whereas on a smooth surface they arise only after a long time, because in these conditions acorn barnacles are attached very tightly.","","","Inst. of Oceanology, Moscow","","","United States","1974-01-01T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: Prot.

This area is unique among thermal areas for its fluid composition. In the reservoir, where temperatures are 250-290/sup 0/C, the brine has a salinity equal to seawater. However, the concentrations of some ions are different and can be explained by relatively simple interaction of seawater with the rock. The trace metal content is low. In the upflow zone, hot brine has been exchanged repeatedly during the life of the system. Surface activity covers an area of 1 km/sup 2/, and a resistivity survey indicated that the system is of similar area above 900 m within the hyaloclastite formation where it is surrounded by cold groundwater of oceanic composition. By contrast, the system is more extensive in the underlying basalt formation of lava flows and thick interbeds of hyaloclastites and sediments. At 2600 m depth, Vp increases from 4.2 to 6.5 km/s. At this depth, the basalt formation is underlain by a denser formation considered to be similar to the 'oceanic layer.' Because of its temperature and composition, feasibility studies indicate that the brine could be economically exploited for production of NaCl, KCl, CaCl/sub 2/, and possibly other components. Aquifers are abundant in the basalt formation. Therefore, it is recommended that production wells penetrate to depths of about 2000 m to withdraw brine from this permeable formation, so as to ensure the highest mass-flow and to minimize the risk of cold seawater intrusion.","","","","","","United States","1972-01-01T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: Am.

Atmospheric contamination is present in all samples. Removal of atmospheric gases by four methods results in four atomic compositions; these are used to compute four equilibrium (molecular) compositions for each sample. Simultaneous consideration of atmospheric and water contaminations defines the best method of atmospheric gas removal and shows that all variations in hydrogen content are due to contaminating water. Calculations also indicate that the carbon content of the magmatic gas is not significantly changed; large differences in sulfur are due to changes in SO/sub 2/. When all modifying processes are considered simultaneously, all differences in sample compositions are accounted for. The changes caused by these processes are ''reversed'' to return each sample to its magmatic composition; all samples yield the same composition. The original analyses are then examined for the degree to which they approach equilibrium. Although none of the analyses is an equilibrium composition, each was at equilibrium at magmatic temperatures. Imperfect quenching and oxidation after collection caused nonequilibrium. Various groups of gases have different reaction rates and exhibit a ''spectrum of quenching temperatures.'' H/sub 2/O contamination occurred after quenching. Volumetric comparisons are made to assess the magnitude of compositional changes and their overall chemical effects.","","","Univ. of Arizona, Tucson","","","United States","1971-12-01T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: Am.

Consideration of the compositional characteristics of such solutions and the extent to which they interact with rocks suggests that the chemical potentials of chloride components such as NaCl are commonly fixed by the composition of the aqueous phase. Under such conditions the chemical potentials of the corresponding oxide components are not independent variables but are controlled by the activity of the hydrogen ion. Recognition of the compositional constraints imposed by the aqueous phase on chemical reactions and equilibrium among phases in geologic systems leads to an integrated thermodynamic frame of reference for description and interpretation of phase relations, and prediction of mass transfer among silicates, sulfides, oxides, carbonates, sulfates, and aqueous solutions.","","","Northwestern Univ., Evanston, IL","","","United States","1970-05-01T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: Am.

A set of methods of high-thermal well sampling determines the state characteristics of carbonate equilibrium in water, the temperature, and the rate of forming calcium carbonate precipitate. These methods were used in the high-thermal water-fields of Bolshebanny and Pauzhetsky in Kamchatka and Goryachy Plazh (Hot Beach) on Kunashir Is. For water sampling of operating wells, a probe, a tube made of stainless steel, was used and inserted in the well through a gasket below the vaporization level. To measure pH in deep-seated water samples, the probe was connected to a high-temperature cell with a glass and reference electrodes mounted in autoclave where natural pressure and temperature conditions were created. A probe with a thermistor was applied for the continuous temperature measurement at different depth and for determining the position of vaporization zone in operating wells. The checking of the well encrustation process was done by means of measuring the internal diameter and the thickness of calcium carbonate layer encrusted on the probe lowered in the well.","","","","","","United States","1970-01-01T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: Geothermics; (United States); Journal Volume: 2","","Medium: X; Size: Pages: 1624-1628","","","","Journal ID: CODEN: GTMCA","10.1016/0375-6505(70)90487-6","","2016-05-19T00:00:00Z","6677320","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/6677320","","Geothermics; (United States)","","2"
