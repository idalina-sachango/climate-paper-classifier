The discharge occurs where faults having a predominant ridge-parallel and an anomalous subsidiary ridge-oblique tectonic trend intersect at the southern end of a linear ridge on the east wall and at another site at the base of the east wall of the rift valley. Hydrothermal alteration of basalt talus and stratiform hydrothermal precipitates produced by past activity occur where faults and fissures with the same two tectonic trends intersect near a fault having a third ridge-transverse trend at a 1 x 1 km zone of sheet flows on the floor of the rift valley. Present and past hydrothermal discharge in this area is controlled by the intersection of an axis-parallel tectonic trend common to all spreading centers having axis-oblique trends related to the regional stress field near the shallowest and volcanically most productive part of the ridge segment.","","","","","","United States","1989-12-01T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: Geology; (USA); Journal Volume: 17:12","","Medium: X; Size: Pages: 1097-1101","","","","Journal ID: ISSN 0091-7613; CODEN: GLGYB","10.1130/0091-7613(1989)017<1097:GCOHDO>2.3.CO;2","","2016-04-29T00:00:00Z","6987531","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/6987531","","Geology; (USA)","","17:12"

The model liquid was restricted to at most four-fold Si-O coordination by the effective imposition of an infinite potential barrier to a fifth bond. The authors obtained and unambiguous comparison of the compression mechanism of solid and liquid tetrahedral networks. In spite of this restriction, the density of the simulated liquid exceeds that of the corresponding models of quartz, coesite and cristobalite at high pressure. The efficient compression of the liquid results from a continuous restructuring of the network that leaves the mean Si-Si distance virtually unchanged and does not require and increase in the coordination number. The restructuring is effected by local breaking and reconnecting of bonds, a mechanism that is not available to a perfect crystal.","","","","","","United States","1989-12-01T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: Geophysical Research Letters (American Geophysical Union); (USA); Journal Volume: 16:12","","Medium: X; Size: Pages: 1403-1406","","","","Journal ID: ISSN 0094-8276; CODEN: GPRLA","10.1029/GL016i012p01403","","2016-04-12T00:00:00Z","5639860","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/5639860","","Geophysical Research Letters (American Geophysical Union); (USA)","","16:12"

Most of the operations in a chemical plant, for instance, involve transporting heat and material among liquids and solids by means of fluid motion. But today, chemical engineers are expanding their expertise beyond the plant doors. The author discusses research programs in this area which involves studies that fall outside of the traditional realm of chemical engineering: blood flow in capillaries, the transport of contaminants in groundwater, the dynamics of geothermal reservoirs, enhanced oil recovery, the processing of fibrous composites, melt-spinning processes, and the growth of silicon crystals.","","","","","","United States","1989-11-01T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: Chemical Engineering Progress; (USA); Journal Volume: 85:11","","Medium: X; Size: Pages: 74-77","","","","Journal ID: ISSN 0009-2495; CODEN: CEPRA","","","2009-12-16T00:00:00Z","5293000","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/5293000","","Chemical Engineering Progress; (USA)","","85:11"

Synkinematic and postkinematic veins record fluid transport and metasomatism during prograde metamorphism and uplift. Vein and host-rock mineralogy and whole-rock compositions demonstrate large-scale chemical redistribution, especially of Si and alkali elements. Veins and host rocks trend toward isotopic equilibration with aqueous fluids with {delta}{sup 18}O{sub SMOW}=+13{per thousand} {plus minus} 1{per thousand}. The likely source for these fluids is in lower temperature, sediment-rich parts of the subduction zone. Carbon isotope systematics support this conclusion and indicate the influence of an organic C source. Quartz solubility relations indicate the importance of fluid-flow paths in chemical redistribution during subduction. These results document large-scale fluid flow and the complexity of possible metasomatic and mechanical mixing processes at intermediate levels of subduction zones. The record of subduction-zone mass transfer in the Catalina Schist is compatible with the record inferred for greater depths from geochemical and petrologic studies of arc magmatism.","","","","","","United States","1989-11-01T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: Geology; (USA); Journal Volume: 17:11","","Medium: X; Size: Pages: 976-980","","","","Journal ID: ISSN 0091-7613; CODEN: GLGYB","","","2009-12-17T00:00:00Z","6159471","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/6159471","","Geology; (USA)","","17:11"

A number of numerical studies have been carried out using Darcy's law to formulate the natural convection heat transfer mathematically in enclosures of internally heat-generating porous media. This paper uses Irmay's momentum equation for radial and axial equations that include inertia terms with models an internally heat-generating porous medium in a short, vertical circular cylinder (R = 2m, H = 4m). The cylinder side and top are isothermal and at the same temperature (T{sub {infinity}}). The bottom surface of the cylinder is adiabatic. The variations in density and viscosity with temperature and inertia are investigated. For slow flows, the effect of inertia would be expected to be small. For large temperature variations, the effects of variable dynamic viscosity and density are expected to be large. The density and the dynamic viscosity of air were represented by the relationships {rho} = {rho}{sub {infinity}} (1 {minus} (T {minus} T{sub {infinity}})/T) and v = v{sub {infinity}} (1 + 2(T {minus} T{sub {infinity}})/T{sub {infinity}}).

Preliminary indications suggest that well could produce about 5 MW of power, though progress to develop the resource appears stalled. Growth has strained the capacity of growing, St. Lucia Electricity Services (LUCELEC), which controls electrical power generation and distribution on the island. Government planners realize that expanding their electric power infrastructure is a necessary prerequisite for continued economic development on this island of 238 square miles and consequently view geothermal for the island's baseload demand with diesel handling peaking requirements.

We present 191 new heat flow measurements from the northern Red Sea forming three traverses across the water covered portion of the rift. The heat flow across the rift systematically increases from values of about 125 mW/m{sup 2} seaward of the coasts to average values greater than 250 mW/m{sup 2} in the axial depression. The heat flow measurements are evaluated for environmental disturbances. These are found to be generally small. The largest estimated disturbance results from the relief of the seafloor and of the top of a subbottom evaporite layer. The relief on these surfaces can account for the 20% point to point scatter typically observed in the heat flow measurements. Limits are placed on systematic disturbances to the heat flow pattern across the rift. The estimated largest systematic disturbance results from sediment blanketing which may cause a reduction in the heat flow on the order of 10%.","","","","","","United States","1989-09-10T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: Journal of Geophysical Research; (USA); Journal Volume: 94:B9","","Medium: X; Size: Pages: 12239-12266","","","","Journal ID: ISSN 0148-0227; CODEN: JGREA","10.1029/JB094iB09p12239","","2016-05-17T00:00:00Z","5325490","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/5325490","","Journal of Geophysical Research; (USA)","","94:B9"

New experiments reacting diabase and evolved seawater were carried out to reproduce earlier published observations of Cl depletions attributed to formation of an ephemeral Cl-bearing mineral. The absence of any Cl depletions in the present study suggests that the formation of Cl-bearing minerals is not sufficiently widespread to account for the observed salinity variations in the vent fluids. A re-evaluation of both field and laboratory evidence has led to a new model for subseafloor circulation that accounts for salinity variations as well as other chemical and mineralogic observations. In place of a simple single-pass convection system, the authors propose that the sea floor systems consist of two vertically nested convection cells in which a brine layer at depth heats and drives an overlying seawater cell. Such layering of salinities, a process known in fluid mechanics as double-diffusive convection, is an expected result when convection is induced in saline fluids. The process provides for stable high-temperature heat transfer upward from the cracking front adjacent to the magma, and for limited chemical exchange of the brine with the overlying seawater to explain salinity variations and high metal contents in the vent fluids. The brine also provides an effective medium to produce the secondary mineral assemblages observed in rocks from the mid-ocean ridges and ophiolites unsuccessfully produced in laboratory studies using seawater. The brine originates from the two-phase separation of seawater during magmatic/tectonic events and accumulates and remains relatively stable in the region immediately above the magma chamber.","","","","","","United States","1989-09-01T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: Journal of Geology; (USA); Journal Volume: 97:5","","Medium: X; Size: Pages: 613-623","","","","Journal ID: ISSN 0022-1376; CODEN: JGEOA","10.1086/629338","","2016-05-20T00:00:00Z","6987503","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/6987503","","Journal of Geology; (USA)","","97:5"

This may be accounted for by the common assumption that ferric and ferrous iron in silicate glasses have equivalent Moessbauer absorption efficiencies at room temperature, which has been shown to be invalid for several crystalline materials. Although this assumption has been demonstrated to be valid for glasses with low concentrations of total iron, the approximation breaks down when total iron concentrations approach 14 wt% Fe{sub 2}O{sub 3}. The authors have measured ferrous iron concentrations in 65 Na{sub 2}O-FeO-Fe{sub 2}O{sub 3}-SiO{sub 2} glasses quenched from melts equilibrated in air between 926 and 1,583{degree}C using a colorimetric wet chemical method. These data were used to derive a symmetric, regular solution model for ferric-ferrous equilibria which has a standard error of 0.36 (2{sigma}) in the prediction of wt% FeO. Additional liquids with initial compositions close to the stoichiometry of acmite (NaFe{sup 3+}Si{sub 2}O{sub 6}) but which crossed the perferruginous join due to sodium loss during high-temperature equilibration (1,420-1,540{degree}C) are significantly reduced relative to other Na{sub 2}O-FeO-Fe{sub 2}O{sub 3}-SiO{sub 2} liquids.

Dissolved Ca, Na, and pH for all experiments responded systematically to differences in dissolved SiO{sub 2} concentrations and the compositions of plagioclase reactants. Diabase alteration at low fluid/rock mass ratios (0.5 to 1) produces fluids undersaturated with respect to quartz during hydration of primary olivine and orthopyroxene, whereas basalt alteration under similar conditions yields fluids slightly supersaturated with respect to quartz during breakdown of glass to smectite and amphibole. Fluid chemistry in all experiments appears to approach a partial equilibrium state with the albite and anorthite components in plagioclase and approaches a pH consistent with plagioclase alteration to epidote. Trace element data from vent fluids, specifically B and Sr, together with major element chemistry, provides evidence that the reaction zone for black-smoker fluids at mid-ocean ridges is composed of only slightly altered diabase and is characterized by small amounts of epidote, nearly fresh plagioclase and clinopyroxene, and partially to completely hydrated olivine and orthopyroxene. Using equilibrium between plagioclase, the dominant reactant, and epidote, the dominant reaction product in experiments, the authors estimate that temperatures in reaction zones are in excess of 375{degree}C for most vent systems. These temperatures are higher than measured vent temperatures, suggesting that hot spring fluids commonly loose heat during ascent to the sea floor.","","","","","","United States","1989-09-01T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: Geochimica et Cosmochimica Acta; (USA); Journal Volume: 53:9","","Medium: X; Size: Pages: 2283-2300","","","","Journal ID: ISSN 0016-7037; CODEN: GCACA","10.1016/0016-7037(89)90351-7","","2016-04-18T00:00:00Z","7024633","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/7024633","","Geochimica et Cosmochimica Acta; (USA)","","53:9"

The determination of stability constants for the above species results from a critical evaluation of available experimental data. Many experimental studies are inconsistent with each other or, by themselves, lack sufficient quantitative information. However, when used together, the data from a few carefully selected studies yield coherent results. Newly derived stability constants for antimony hydroxide and arsenious acid indicate that, at the sulfide concentrations considered here, these species are generally unimportant relative to sulfide complexes, although they become the dominant arsenic and antimony species at high temperatures in most geothermal systems.","","","","","","United States","1989-09-01T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: Geochimica et Cosmochimica Acta; (USA); Journal Volume: 53:9","","Medium: X; Size: Pages: 2185-2194","","","","Journal ID: ISSN 0016-7037; CODEN: GCACA","10.1016/0016-7037(89)90342-6","","2016-05-16T00:00:00Z","7078648","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/7078648","","Geochimica et Cosmochimica Acta; (USA)","","53:9"

Exploration drilling in the late 1950s down to 1,100 m provided physical information on the system. Petrologic study of drillcore samples recovered from seven wells reveals an alteration assemblage of quartz and albite + adularia, with a variable distribution of chlorite, pyrite, calcite, zeolites, epidote, pyrrhotite, sphene, leucoxene, apatite and minor base metal sulfides; white mica is a late overprint, particularly well developed at shallow depths. The present deep fluids boil adiabatically from at least 300{degree}C to 230{degree}C; at depths of {le}500 m, this ascending chloride fluid is variably diluted by a steam-heated water that lies over, and occurs on the margin of, the system like a discontinuous umbrella; the steam-heated water is relatively CO{sub 2}-rich ({le}0.1 m). The cooling at shallow levels by this mixing has shifted the alteration from albite-adularia stability to white mica stability; this shift is enhanced by the CO{sub 2}-rich nature of the diluent. The shallow portion of the Waiotapu geothermal system has recently evolved, both chemically and physically, by incursion of fluids from a steam-heated carapace. Continued refluxing of these relatively cool, hybrid fluids progressively deeper (with their recycled CO{sub 2} content) will hasten hydrolytic leaching (in contrast to a single pass of adiabatically cooling deep fluids). This action, accompanied by argillic alteration, may eventually seal the deeper portions of the system, hastening its demise. There is evidence for similar events occurring in the fossil environment at epithermal depths.","","","","","","United States","1989-09-01T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: Geochimica et Cosmochimica Acta; (USA); Journal Volume: 53:9","","Medium: X; Size: Pages: 2235-2257","","","","Journal ID: ISSN 0016-7037; CODEN: GCACA","10.1016/0016-7037(89)90347-5","","2016-05-10T00:00:00Z","7078670","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/7078670","","Geochimica et Cosmochimica Acta; (USA)","","53:9"

Correlation algorithms similar to those used to estimate equation of state parameters for ions and electrolytes have also been developed for neutral aqueous species. Calculation of the standard partial molal thermodynamic properties of dissolved inorganic gases as well as other neutral aqueous species as a function of pressure and temperature indicates that the standard partial molal volume ({bar V}{sup 0}), heat capacity ({bar C}{sup 0}{sub P}), and entropy ({bar S}{sup 0}), together with the apparent standard partial molal enthalpy of formation ({Delta}{bar H}{sup 0}) of many of these species in the liquid phase minimize with increasing temperature at P{sub SAT}{sup *} and approach {infinity} at the critical point of H{sub 2}O.

(Progressive Optimality Principle) based short-term hydrothermal scheduling algorithm. In a P.O.P. based scheduling algorithm, the trapping phenomenon can severely hinder solution optimality, and thus limits its applicability. The trapping phenomenon is caused by the weak links which break the optimization path into isolated segments, and thus destroy the path continuity required by the P.O.P. based decomposition approach. In order to ensure path continuity, the proposed method identifies and bypasses the potential weak links, such that global optimality can be achieved progressively by successively solving a sequence of two-hour sub-problems. In this paper, examples are used to illustrate the trapping phenomenon and the proposed method.","","","Oklahoma Univ.

In addition, the phase equilibria study will be used as a basis for a study of the influence of fluorine content on the crystal morphology and kinetics of plagioclase growth in the same system. This report details the effect of varying amounts of fluorine, in the absence of water, on phase equilibria in the system NaAlSi{sub 3}O{sub 8}-CaAl{sub 2}Si{sub 2}O{sub 8}-F{sub 2}O{sub {minus}1} at pressures to 10 kbar. The effects of fluorine and of water on the phase equilibria can be directly compared, as a study on H{sub 2}O-saturated melts in the fluorine-free system has been completed previously. The effects of the two volatiles on activity-composition relations can also be compared from thermodynamic calculations based on available thermochemical data. Finally, selected run products were analyzed with an electron microprobe to examine the effect of fluorine on the composition of the plagioclase in equilibrium with fluorine-bearing liquid.","","","","","","United States","1989-08-01T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: Geochimica et Cosmochimica Acta; (USA); Journal Volume: 53:8","","Medium: X; Size: Pages: 1937-1942","","","","Journal ID: ISSN 0016-7037; CODEN: GCACA","10.1016/0016-7037(89)90314-1","","2016-05-09T00:00:00Z","7024606","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/7024606","","Geochimica et Cosmochimica Acta; (USA)","","53:8"

REE preferentially partition into the end-member liquids that are rich in network-modifying cations, with two-liquid partition coefficients greater than any other cation. The two-liquid partition coefficients of REE in a given experiment are essentially identical to one another. No evidence was seen to suggest that the solution mechanisms of REE in high-silica liquids vary with differences in their ionic radii. Two-lattice models of trace element solution behavior fail to remove the compositional dependence of REE two-liquid partition coefficients due to the assumption that all network-forming and network-modifying cations mix ideally with one another. As a result, it is probably incorrect to derive physical interpretations from the results of the application of two-lattice models. The results are applied to the origins of the LREE-enriched phenocryst-matrix partition coefficients seen for some ferromagnesian minerals in high-silica rhyolites. Since liquids with extremely high concentrations of T-O-T linkages do not strongly discriminate between the REE on the basis of their ionic radii, the anomalous REE crystal-matrix partition coefficient patterns are best explained as the result of contamination of these minerals by LREE accessory phases.","","","","","","United States","1989-08-01T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: Geochimica et Cosmochimica Acta; (USA); Journal Volume: 53:8","","Medium: X; Size: Pages: 1965-1974","","","","Journal ID: ISSN 0016-7037; CODEN: GCACA","10.1016/0016-7037(89)90317-7","","2016-05-24T00:00:00Z","7170877","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/7170877","","Geochimica et Cosmochimica Acta; (USA)","","53:8"

Most of the wolframite crystals contain two forms of zonation: a physical zonation, observed optically and by electron imaging, and a compositional zonation revealed by X-ray traverses. Compositional zoning is progressive, involving gradual changes in mineral chemistry from core to rim, on which is superimposed a form of oscillatory zoning involving repeated resetting of compositions. Physical zones are layers of uniform width separated by distinct boundaries; they are arranged parallel to crystal faces and reflect intermittent crystal growth. Progressive variation in wolframite chemistry is readily explained in terms of gradually changing physiochemical conditions, such as pH, fO{sub 2}, temperature, pressure and fluid composition, during crystallization. The oscillatory zonation reflects cyclicity of those conditions. Plausible models which could explain such effects include: (a) intermittent mixing of chemically distinct magmatic and meteoric fluids, and (b) repeated hydraulic fracturing and injection of fluids leading to fluctuating pressure and temperature of the hydrothermal fluid. Volatile species (F, Cl, CO{sub 2}) may have been effective as complexing agents thus affecting the supply of Nb from the fluid. Deposition of Nb- and Ta-rich compositions were probably favored by high fO{sub 2}, low pH conditions.","","","","","","United States","1989-08-01T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: Geochimica et Cosmochimica Acta; (USA); Journal Volume: 53:8","","Medium: X; Size: Pages: 1921-1935","","","","Journal ID: ISSN 0016-7037; CODEN: GCACA","10.1016/0016-7037(89)90313-X","","2016-05-30T00:00:00Z","7170881","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/7170881","","Geochimica et Cosmochimica Acta; (USA)","","53:8"

The distinctive, hot, hypersaline brine (typically >20 wt% total dissolved solids) for which the SSGS is known is overlain by a cooler (<260{degree}C) fluid with distinctly lower salinity (typically <10 wt% total dissolved solids). Hypersaline brines have high and rather consistent {sup 18}O shifts produced by water-rock interaction and have a very narrow range in {delta}D values. Low TDS fluids, on the other hand, show a wide range in both {delta}D and {delta}{sup 18}O. production of both types of fluid from closely spaced geothermal wells in many regions of the SSGS indicates that a relatively sharp salinity interface exists over much of the field. The fluid interface typically cross-cuts sedimentary bedding but is consistently found where reservoir temperatures are approximately 260{degree}C. At these temperatures, hypersaline brines have densities of approximately 1.0 gm/cm{sup 3}, while the low TDS fluids have densities as low as 0.85 gm/cm{sup 3}. This stable, density-stratified interface acts as a barrier to convective heat and mass transfer in the SSGS, isolating the hypersaline reservoir from overlying dilute fluids. A lithologic cap implied by previous SSGS models is unnecessary in such a stratified system since heat and mass transfer across the interface must occur by slow conductive, diffusional and interface mixing processes regardless of local permeability.","","","","","","United States","1989-08-01T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: Geochimica et Cosmochimica Acta; (USA); Journal Volume: 53:8","","Medium: X; Size: Pages: 1905-1920","","","","Journal ID: ISSN 0016-7037; CODEN: GCACA","10.1016/0016-7037(89)90312-8","","2016-05-30T00:00:00Z","7170890","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/7170890","","Geochimica et Cosmochimica Acta; (USA)","","53:8"

LEQ is a good approximation if an initial disequilibrium condition relaxes to an equilibrium state over a distance and time period that is less than the spatial and temporal scales-of-interest. These scales-of-interest depend on the particular problem under investigation and include the hundreds of meters scale for field investigations, the sub-meter scale for laboratory investigations and the sub-crystal scale. An equation representing the scale-of-interest and describing advective, diffusive and dispersive transport coupled with irreversible heterogeneous reaction is derived and analytically solved for a single component (silica), monomineralic (quartz), one-dimensional system. Typically, t{sub eq} {approx} 1 year and l{sub eq} {approx} 10 m for sedimentary basins; t{sub eq} {approx} 3 days and l{sub eq} {approx} 10 mm for host rocks in magma-hydrothermal systems; t{sub eq} {approx} 10 hours and l{sub eq} = 250 {mu}m for regional metamorphic environments; t{sub eq} {approx} 1 year and l{sub eq} {approx} 100 m for injection wells; t{sub eq} {approx} 700 years and l{sub eq} {approx} 75 km for laboratory core flow experiments. These values depend on the specifics of each environment and can vary over orders of magnitudes. LEQ is a good approximation if t{sub eq} and l{sub eq} are less than the scales-of-interest. This analysis, though quantitative, is only approximate because it does not include the effects of competing heterogeneous reactions. These effects result in over-estimation of t{sub eq} and l{sub eq} for low temperatures silicate environments and under-estimation of t{sub eq} and l{sub eq} for high temperature environments.","","","","","","United States","1989-08-01T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: Geochimica et Cosmochimica Acta; (USA); Journal Volume: 53:8","","Medium: X; Size: Pages: 1955-1964","","","","Journal ID: ISSN 0016-7037; CODEN: GCACA","10.1016/0016-7037(89)90316-5","","2016-04-19T00:00:00Z","7170871","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/7170871","","Geochimica et Cosmochimica Acta; (USA)","","53:8"

As the proportion of internal heating increases, the number of upwelling plumes increases, and downwelling sheets become more vigorous and time-dependent. With any amount of basal heating, the entire convective pattern, during its evolution, is anchored to the upwelling plumes. As the proportion of internal heating increases, the heat flow carried by the upwelling plumes remains a large fraction of the basal heat flow. Downwelling sheets carry only a minor fraction (approximately 30%) of the basal heat flow (even when the shell is entirely heated from below), but they advect almost all of the internally generated heat. The relatively large number of plumes in the Earth's mantle (inferred from hotspots), the possibility that downwelling slabs are vigorous enough to penetrate the lower mantle, and the small fraction of terrestrial surface heat flow carried by plumes all suggest that the mantle is predominantly heated from within. /copyright/ American Geophysical Union 1989","","","Department of Earth and Space Sciences, University of California, Los Angeles (US); Earth and Space Sciences Division, Los Alamos National Laboratory","","","United States","1989-07-01T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: Geophys.

Drilling fluids must be circulated to cool them and prevent conversion to steam. Cement designs must be special. Likewise, if a geothermal well blows out, the techniques to kill it are different than those used to control oil and gas wells. The difficulties are increased if the blowing well is shallow. This was the case when Ormat's 14-6 well blew out near Fallon, Nevada, last January. The well was drilled using the same drilling program followed on other field wells. However, an unexpected fault caused severe lost circulation, and eventually, the well blew out. The operator, Ormat Energy Sytems, Inc., which had an impeccable record for safety and efficiently run operations, immediately responded to the situation by calling in Houston's Neal Adams Firefighters,. Control operations were directed by team leader, Neal Adeams. The nature of the problems required a combination of surface and subsurface control techniques.

The Bayda zone extends through the volcanic section into the upper sheeted dike complex and is interpreted as having formed on the ridge crest above an axial magma chamber; the Aarja zone terminates against a plagiogranite pluton that intrudes the lower volcanic section and is thought to have formed after Bayda in an off-axis environment. Structural, stratigraphic, and compositional characteristics of the Bayda and Aarja massive sulfide bodies are consistent with this interpretation. The geometry of the discharge zones suggests that in both cases upflow occurred in broad zones (at least 400-600 m wide) that were elongated along strike (i.e., parallel to the spreading axis).","","","","","","United States","1989-06-01T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: Geology; (USA); Journal Volume: 17:6","","Medium: X; Size: Pages: 531-535","","","","Journal ID: ISSN 0091-7613; CODEN: GLGYB","10.1130/0091-7613(1989)017<0531:HDZBMS>2.3.CO;2","","2016-05-16T00:00:00Z","7012858","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/7012858","","Geology; (USA)","","17:6"

At least five systems were active at this time, three of which are located on or near the intersection of major faults and lineaments. Two deposits can be dated as Early Devonian, whereas others show a spatial relation to 408 Ma Caledonian granitoids-the proposed heat sources for the geothermal systems. Fault zones active at this time provided channelways for fluids in the convecting systems. The shallow sections of these systems have been preserved in the Arndilly, Dalroy, Lecht, and Rhynie areas, which is encouraging for gold prospecting. Six targets for epithermal gold exploration are identified: the four areas named above and two areas at the intersection of major faults and lineaments.","","","","","","United States","1989-06-01T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: Geology; (USA); Journal Volume: 17:6","","Medium: X; Size: Pages: 568-571","","","","Journal ID: ISSN 0091-7613; CODEN: GLGYB","10.1130/0091-7613(1989)017<0568:EDGSIN>2.3.CO;2","","2016-04-20T00:00:00Z","7259369","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/7259369","","Geology; (USA)","","17:6"

Gravity effects were shown to affect the pressure transients significantly because of the large difference in the densities of liquid water and vapor. Production from such systems enhances steam/liquid-water counterflow and expands the vapor-dominated zone at the top of the reservoir. Subcooled liquid regions develop in the center of the reservoir as a result of gravity drainage of cooler liquid water. The vapor zone acts as a constant-pressure boundary and helps to stabilize the pressure decline in the system. The pressure transients at observation wells were shown to depend greatly on the location (depth) of the major feed zone; if this is not accounted for, large errors in deduced reservoir properties will result. At shallow observation points, pressures may actually increase as a result of enhanced steam upflow caused by production at a deep feed zone.","","","Lawrence Livermore National Lab.

To assess the impact of these hydrothermal inputs on ocean chemistry, the authors have examined he behavior of REEs for hydrothermal sediments collected adjacent to two Pacific spreading ridge sites: the East Pacific Rise at 19{degree}S, and the Southern Juan de Fuca Ridge at 45{degree}N. In general, the REE/Fe ratios for both proximal and distal hydrothermal sediments are greater than vent solutions by a factor of 2 to 500, and these ratios increase with increasing distance away from the ridge axis. An evaluation of these results in the context of previous models of REE behavior indicates that, in fact, seawater experiences a net depletion in REEs as a result of hydrothermal activity. This is due primarily to the large scavenging capacity of iron oxyhydroxides which precipitate from these solutions. Such an interpretation explains why the REE content of seawater collected in the vicinity of hydrothermal vents is anomalously lower than normal seawater sampled from a comparable depth.","","","","","","United States","1989-03-01T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: Geochimica et Cosmochimica Acta; (USA); Journal Volume: 53:3","","Medium: X; Size: Pages: 757-762","","","","Journal ID: ISSN 0016-7037; CODEN: GCACA","10.1016/0016-7037(89)90019-7","","2016-05-16T00:00:00Z","5163744","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/5163744","","Geochimica et Cosmochimica Acta; (USA)","","53:3"

While the primary responsibility for furthering solar usage remains with the legislatures, both federal and state, a significant role remains for the courts. This role appears to have been largely overlooked in the past. The crucial question is whether the courts are prepared to seize the initiative and exercise the role available to them. As the relevant case law shows, the present evidence is inconclusive. Some courts have sought to advance the cause of solar energy on grounds of public policy, while other courts have ignored the policy arguments and applied a technical legal analysis to the detriment of the solar user. This article attempt to point the way forward for the courts and embolden them in the need to safeguard solar access and advance the use of solar energy. If this is to occur, however, the courts must show the reforming zeal that has characterized the development of the common law, particularly in the United States, at various times in the past.","","","","","","United States","1989-01-01T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: Journal of Energy Law and Policy; (USA); Journal Volume: 9:2","","Medium: X; Size: Pages: 135-175","","","","Journal ID: ISSN 0275-9926; CODEN: JELPE","","","2009-12-16T00:00:00Z","5231646","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/5231646","","Journal of Energy Law and Policy; (USA)","","9:2"

The model accommodates the essential mechanisms of permeability enhancement or degradation resulting from injection of fluid at a temperature different from ambient. The effects of induced thermal strains and fluid pressures in conditioning both normal and shear displacements in an ubiquitously jointed continuum are accommodated. The mass is idealized as a blocky assemblage where diffusive-advective energy transport in the fracture system is augmented by transient heat supply from intact rock blocks. The true transient nature of both energy supply from the blocks to the percolating fluid and the development of thermal strains within the medium are determined analytically. The local assumption of full lateral restraint coupled with analytical representation of thermal strains renders the nonlinear initial-value problem fully defined in terms of the two dependent variables of fluid pressure and fluid temperature only. Subject to these assumptions, complete fluid-pressure and fluid-temperature histories of large, thermally stimulated reservoirs may be determined effectively and efficiently. Results are presented for both single point injection and dual point injection-withdrawal scenarios to illustrate the possible scope of the method.","","","","","","United States","1989-01-01T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: Geothermics (International Journal of Geothermal Research and its Applications); (UK); Journal Volume: 18:5/6","","Medium: X; Size: Pages: 691-710","","","","Journal ID: ISSN 0375-6505; CODEN: GTMCA","","","2009-12-16T00:00:00Z","5795057","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/5795057","","Geothermics (International Journal of Geothermal Research and its Applications); (UK)","","18:5/6"

Mineralogical and mineral-chemical data are consistent with hydrothermal alteration in the temperature range 200{sup 0}-270{sup 0}C, with deeper portions of the system having undergone temperatures in excess of 300{sup 0}C. Thermodynamic calculations suggest that the observed alteration assemblage is not equilibrium with current well fluids, unless estimates of reservoir pH are incorrect. Fe-Al zoning of prehnite and epidote in veins is consistent with rapid, isothermal fluctuations in fluid composition at current reservoir temperatures, and may be due to changes in volatile content of the fluid due to tectonic activity.","","","","","","United States","1989-01-01T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: Geothermics; (USA); Journal Volume: 18:1","","Medium: X; Size: Pages: 279-286","","","","Journal ID: ISSN 0375-6505; CODEN: GTMCA","10.1016/0375-6505(89)90037-0","","2016-04-20T00:00:00Z","5275655","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/5275655","","Geothermics; (USA)","","18:1"

Papers were presented on field and laboratory studies of scale deposition from geothermal fluids and in geothermal reservoirs. Scale types investigated included carbonate minerals, amorphous silicates, and mixed metal oxides and sulfides. Scale formation was reported to occur in geothermal systems under a wide range of enthalpy and chemical conditions. The predominant factors found to control the solubility of scale-forming minerals include changes in temperature and pH with lesser control being exerted by the concentrations of other ionic species and by kinetic effects. The range of conditions under which scale mineral formation occurs has resulted in the deposition of these minerals throughout the geothermal utilization system including production wells, surface equipment, and wastewater reinjection wells. Chemical and engineering methods applied to the treatment of scale-forming minerals during extraction of geothermal heat included the addition of chemical inhibitors, control of fluid pressures and temperatures, and mechanical and chemical removal of deposited scale minerals. The work reported at the conference indicated that the success of these methods was somewhat limited, and additional work was recommended on more effective methods.","","","","","","United States","1989-01-01T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: Geothermics; (USA); Journal Volume: 18:1","","Medium: X; Size: Pages: 5-15","","","","Journal ID: ISSN 0375-6505; CODEN: GTMCA","10.1016/0375-6505(89)90004-7","","2016-05-03T00:00:00Z","5276040","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/5276040","","Geothermics; (USA)","","18:1"

Retarding and accelerating effects of aluminium on the growth of polysilicic acid particles and on the reaction between monosilicic acid and polysilicic acid were observed by changing the pH. It is suggested that the accelerating effect on the reaction between polysilicic acid particles is due to the formation of aluminium hydroxide on the surface of polysilicic acid. The rate of decrease in the monosilicic acid concentration in the presence of aluminium was faster than that in the absence of aluminium at pH 9, because monosilicic acid could be adsorbed rapidly on the aluminium hydroxide. From the results it is presumed that the formation of aluminium hydroxide on the solid surface may accelerate the deposition of silicic acid from geothermal water.","","","","","","United States","1989-01-01T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: Geothermics; (USA); Journal Volume: 18:1","","Medium: X; Size: Pages: 321-325","","","","Journal ID: ISSN 0375-6505; CODEN: GTMCA","10.1016/0375-6505(89)90042-4","","2016-05-27T00:00:00Z","5276043","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/5276043","","Geothermics; (USA)","","18:1"

After two or three years of exploitation of the geothermal doublets in the northern part of the Paris basin, scaling and plugging problems have appeared in some cases. The results of the detailed study carried out at La Courneuve Nord, a typical site of this area, are presented. The drawdown of production rate, scaling in the heat exchanger and the increase of injection pressure required a rapid decision for workover operations on the wells. These cleaning operations and joint research studies allowed the authors to identify the cause of the plugging as well as to locate these deposits and to estimate their importance. After cleaning operations, the hydraulic properties of the reservoir seem to be recovered. Chemical and mineralogical analyses of these deposits identified the presence of a large variety of iron sulfide and a typical corrosion product. Biochemical and bacteriological studies show a very high content of micro-organisms. A chemical model, IPDEGAZ, is used to calculate the evolution of the saturation indexes of the fluid with respect to iron sulfide phases. The effects of parameters such as pressure, temperature, degassing and addition of iron by corrosion are simulated.

The application of several dimensionality tests showed that the data were predominantly one dimensional except at the longest periods. Electrical resistivity models were derived from the application of several 1-D modelling procedures and for sites close to the boreholes M-1, M-2 and M-3 the resulting models were compared with the borehole data. The Dawes and Parker D+ algorithms were the most successful in revealing an interface at the reservoir depth at all three boreholes and, as a result, were used in the subsequent collation of 1-D models along a number of traverses.

Additional hot water will be obtained by heating and deaerating fresh water using high temperature geothermal fluid. The heated fresh water will mix with low-temperature geothermal water in the distribution system in Reykjavik. A pilot plant has been set up to investigate magnesium silicate scale formation when mixing of these waters occurs. Tests show that the scale formation is dependent on the severity of deaeration of the fresh water the proportion of geothermal water in the mixture. Increased deaeration and thermal water proportion increase the pH of the mixture, and this promotes scaling. The scale formed is poorly crystalline, near amorphous trioctahedral smectite close to saponite in composition. By using minimum deaeration and traces of geothermal steam to remove the last remaining dissolved oxygen, scaling in the distribution system can be avoided.","","","","","","United States","1989-01-01T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: Geothermics; (USA); Journal Volume: 18:1","","Medium: X; Size: Pages: 113-120","","","","Journal ID: ISSN 0375-6505; CODEN: GTMCA","10.1016/0375-6505(89)90017-5","","2016-04-15T00:00:00Z","5323535","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/5323535","","Geothermics; (USA)","","18:1"

Scaling problems have only occurred in a few cases during exploitation. The most severe cases are due to precipitation of calcium carbonate in brackish water and occur both in downhole pumps and surface installations. In plants heating fresh water scaling by magnesium silicate has occurred. In the high-temperature geothermal fields calcium carbonate precipitation in wells is not uncommon but occurs at shallow levels and is amended by reaming the wells at regular intervals. Silica scaling in waste water is a general problem in most of the fields, but is mostly avoided inside the plants and in the distribution piping. Aluminium-silicates have been troublesome where the high-temperature waters have been used directly for heating as they are precipitated at temperatures well above saturation with opaline silica at which point the onset of scaling was expected. From the brine in the Reykjanes field there have been encountered downhole scales of iron-magnesium-silicates, and metalsulfide with high contents of precious metals is precipitated at the wellhead of one of the wells, Rn-9. Iron-silicates were precipitated from the magnetic influenced geothermal fluid in the Krafla field and metallic sulfides and oxides were also present in the scales blocking the wells at that time.","","","","","","United States","1989-01-01T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: Geothermics; (USA); Journal Volume: 18:1","","Medium: X; Size: Pages: 183-190","","","","Journal ID: ISSN 0375-6505; CODEN: GTMCA","10.1016/0375-6505(89)90026-6","","2016-04-14T00:00:00Z","5322943","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/5322943","","Geothermics; (USA)","","18:1"

The change in the production behavior of the wells with the restriction imposed by the deposited calcite has been studied trying to evaluate and quantify the scaling problem. Work is being done on predictions of the deposition rate, location and distribution of the deposited mineral inside the wells. This work was compared with real data obtained from caliper logs of the wells before and after production. The feasibility of the first 55 MW power plant has been demonstrated. It was considered that the solution for the calcite problem is the reaming during discharge of the wells trying at the same time to minimize the cleaning interventions with a new well design.

In order to precipitate silica out of this brine caustic soda is added. To get an effective precipitation of silica, a pH of at least 8.2 has to be reached. By using an electromagnetic field, a pH of 7.3-7.8 is sufficient to precipitate silica and an increased settling rate is observed. Settling rates were found to be from 7.1-9.7 cm/min at 100{sup 0}C and from 3.4-4.6 cm/min at 40{sup 0}C, compared to 1.3 cm/min for silica which was only alkalized.

Some waters with high temperatures may be undersaturated. Boiling causes a drastic decrease in CO/sub 2/ partial pressures which leads to supersaturation and calcite precipitation. The supersaturation reaches maximum soon after boiling is initiated. At this maximum the water has been almost quantitatively degassed. Further boiling, which leads to cooling, will cause successively decreasing supersaturation as the solubility of calcite increases with decreasing temperature. The magnitude of supersaturation is largely controlled by the initial temperature and the salinity of the geothermal water, being highest when salinity is highest and temperature lowest. Calcite deposition tends to be troublesome only when the first level of boiling is in the well. When extensive boiling starts in the aquifer, calcite precipitation is not experienced although it is expected to occur in the formation. The pore volume in the reservoir is much larger than that of individual wellbores and can cope with calcite deposition without observable deterioration of permeability for periods as long as the lifetime (20-50 years) of individual wells.","","","","","","United States","1989-01-01T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: Geothermics; (USA); Journal Volume: 18:1","","Medium: X; Size: Pages: 33-39","","","","Journal ID: ISSN 0375-6505; CODEN: GTMCA","10.1016/0375-6505(89)90007-2","","2016-05-20T00:00:00Z","5322376","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/5322376","","Geothermics; (USA)","","18:1"

Raw BHT data are, on the average, cooler than true formation temperatures. To estimate true formation temperatures, corrections must be applied. Empirical BHT corrections may be applied to BHT data for which only depths of measurement are known, but may not be valid outside of the area for which they are calibrated. If multiple BHT measurements from successive logging runs are available, the Horner plot correction procedure can be used. The accuracy of the Horner plot is limited by simplifying assumptions made in its derivation, and by the common lack of information on parameters such as duration of mud circulation. More detailed and complete treatments provide insight into the borehole equilibration process, but their application is similarly limited by a common lack of data regarding borehole thermal properties. A new type of empirical correction procedure may be derived in some areas and allows a correction to be made for BHTs for which only a depth and time of measurement are known.","","","","","","United States","1989-01-01T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: Geothermics (International Journal of Geothermal Research and its Applications); (UK); Journal Volume: 18:5/6","","Medium: X; Size: Pages: 775-790","","","","Journal ID: ISSN 0375-6505; CODEN: GTMCA","10.1016/0375-6505(89)90106-5","","2016-05-16T00:00:00Z","5794964","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/5794964","","Geothermics (International Journal of Geothermal Research and its Applications); (UK)","","18:5/6"

The deep fluid has a temperature of at least 250--300{degrees} C, and an inferred chloride concentration of 1400--1600 mg/kg. Apart from fumarolic areas near the summits of the two volcanoes, most thermal activity occurs at low elevation along the two main outflow paths towards the coast. The hot spring waters of downtown Beppu have originated from outflow along the Asamigawa Fault, with their chemistry indicating predominantly dilution of the deep fluid by groundwater. The second outflow zone towards the hot spring area of downtown Kamegawa coincides with a ridge of lavas. Here boiling, steam loss, and subsequent mixing with steam-heated groundwaters have significantly modified both the deep fluid and host rocks. The area of the geothermal system above 200{degrees} C is at least 15 km{sup 2} at sea level, and the total natural heat output is inferred to be at least 250 MW. Most of this heat output occurs as subsurface hot water outflows towards the coast due to the 1300 m of topographic relief across the system.","","","","","","United States","1989-01-01T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: Geothermics (International Journal of Geothermal Research and its Applications); (UK); Journal Volume: 18:5/6","","Medium: X; Size: Pages: 743-760","","","","Journal ID: ISSN 0375-6505; CODEN: GTMCA","10.1016/0375-6505(89)90104-1","","2016-05-23T00:00:00Z","5877342","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/5877342","","Geothermics (International Journal of Geothermal Research and its Applications); (UK)","","18:5/6"

Major elements and some trace elements concentrations (Li, Rb, Cs, Sr, Ba, Mn) correlate closely with Na concentrations. The correlations in a log-log diagram are linear with a slope close to the electric charge of the ion. This is explained, for major elements, by an equilibrium between a complete assemblage of minerals and a water containing varying amounts of chloride. It is suggested, from the Cl/Br ratio, that chloride originates by halite dissolution during the descent of the water.","","","","","","United States","1989-01-01T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: Geothermics (International Journal of Geothermal Research and its Applications); (UK); Journal Volume: 18:5/6","","Medium: X; Size: Pages: 729-742","","","","Journal ID: ISSN 0375-6505; CODEN: GTMCA","10.1016/0375-6505(89)90103-X","","2016-05-05T00:00:00Z","5877435","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/5877435","","Geothermics (International Journal of Geothermal Research and its Applications); (UK)","","18:5/6"

However, severe reinjection problems at the Melleray geothermal exploitation, near Orleans, have delayed the use of such aquifers in France. A fluid with a TDS of 35g/l at 72{sup 0}C tapped by the production well of Melleray has been carefully studied. The reinjection problems are mainly due to gas bubbles and solid particles clogging the pores of the sandstones. In order to establish a fluid treatment with a view to reinjection, a small-scale pilot plant has been designed. This pilot plant enables several physical and chemical fluid treatment procedures to be tested. Degassing of the fluid looks particularly favorable to avoid rapid clogging by gas bubbles. However this process may induce carbonate scaling, especially as the geothermal fluid at depth is in chemical equilibrium with respect to calcite. In the case of fluid degassing, the scaling potential has been evaluated, using the computer code TPDEGAZ. It is shown that an appropriate choice of exploitation scheme combined with the use of crystal growth inhibitors would allow exploitation of the Melleray geothermal resource.","","","","","","United States","1989-01-01T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: Geothermics; (USA); Journal Volume: 18:1","","Medium: X; Size: Pages: 313-320","","","","Journal ID: ISSN 0375-6505; CODEN: GTMCA","10.1016/0375-6505(89)90041-2","","2016-05-12T00:00:00Z","5415494","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/5415494","","Geothermics; (USA)","","18:1"

The chemical reaction of the circulation fluid with the reservoir rock may lead to the undesirable corrosion or scaling of the reservoir itself, or associated engineering structures. Two potential circulation fluids for use in a high temperature (200{sup 0}C) HDR system in granite in SW England, are a dilute groundwater, and a modified seawater composition. The reaction of these fluids with granite has been evaluated experimentally, with particular emphasis upon the characterization of solid precipitates. Secondary solids associated with the reaction of groundwater with granite consist of clay and Ca-zeolite. Product fluids were alkaline, of low salinity and were relatively benign for heat exchange purposes. Chemical analysis of precipitated clay by analytical transmission electron microscopy reveal a range of composition between illite and smectite. The precipitation of MHSH and clay is instrumental in governing the low pH of the product fluid, which would pose problems concerning the corrosion of pumps, heat exchangers, etc in a possible HDR geothermal system. The suitability of each of the potential heat exchange fluids may be linked to their initial Mg contents.","","","","","","United States","1989-01-01T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: Geothermics; (USA); Journal Volume: 18:1","","Medium: X; Size: Pages: 233-240","","","","Journal ID: ISSN 0375-6505; CODEN: GTMCA","10.1016/0375-6505(89)90032-1","","2016-05-27T00:00:00Z","5415545","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/5415545","","Geothermics; (USA)","","18:1"

Evaluation of four geothermal system which produce Cl-bearing steam provides evidence for the presence of Cl as HCl and the natural reservoir conditions which can produce HCl-bearing steam. Theoretical calculations defining the physical and chemical conditions of the reservoir liquid which can produce HCI-bearing steam are presented. The main factors are pH, temperature and Cl concentration. Lower pH, higher temperature and higher chlorinity allow more HCl to be volatized with steam. In order to reach the surface in steam, the HCl cannot contact liquid water in which it is more soluble, essentially limiting transport to superheated steam.

The island is mainly volcanic. It belongs to the Aegean Active Arc, within which the Milos archipelago shows the most important volcanism in terms of quantity, variety of products and duration of activity (3.5-0.8 M.a.). There are no large central volcanic edifices but different, frequently coeval eruption centres. The initial and intermediate phases of activity were mainly pyroclastic and submarine, whereas the last one (0.1 M.a.) was subaerial and formed tuff rings, surge deposits and lava flows, all of homogenous rhyolitic composition. Recent detailed studies have addressed the mechanism of feeding and the type of magmatic chambers beneath Milos. Distention tectonics have two main phases: an earlier one (Pliocene) with NE-SW direction and a much more intense recent (Quaternary) one, trending NW-SE. The geological, tectonic and magmatic activity favoured the formation of a high enthalpy geothermal field. Many fossil and active thermal manifestations exist: hot springs, fumaroles, hot grounds, phreatic explosion craters. The hydrothermal alteration of the volcanites produced, by self sealing, a perfect cover for the geothermal fluids. Geothermometry of the surface fluids indicated high values for the source temperatures and very high geothermal gradients in central and eastern Milos.

Since the data show this activity to be confined to depths greater than 4 km, their spatial distribution cannot help to delineate directly features of the shallow geothermal reservoir which has been proven by drilling. An array of up to 30 simultaneously operating three-component tape-recording seismometers allowed detection of anomalies in the propagation of waves from these sources on their path to the surface through domains which may contain reservoirs. Clear and strong anisotropy was demonstrated by shear-wave splitting, which may be attributed tentatively to oriented fluid-filled microcracks or fracture systems. The density of observation points and different positions of source regions allowed strong changes to be documented. A change with depth of the type of velocity anomaly may indicate a change in fracture density and liquid saturation. The distribution of seismicity and type of heterogeneity and anisotropy are discussed in terms of phase transitions in geothermal fluids in different states of confinement and in terms of the variation of mechanical behaviour and phase transition on approaching a possible heat source at depth.","","","","","","United States","1989-01-01T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: Geothermics; (USA); Journal Volume: 18:4","","Medium: X; Size: Pages: 579-595","","","","Journal ID: ISSN 0375-6505; CODEN: GTMCA","10.1016/0375-6505(89)90058-8","","2016-05-26T00:00:00Z","5416327","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/5416327","","Geothermics; (USA)","","18:4"

The authors conducted a study to evaluate the geochemical effects of this process. Computer modelling using EQ3/6 permitted comparison of mineral preciptiation/dissolution effects between SRWW and two current injectates: produced steam condensate, and meteoric water from Big Sulfur Creek (BSCW). A conceptual model involving injectate propagation, heat transfer, and chemical processes provides the framework for evaluating simulation results. Computer modeling indicates that, prior to substantial boiling, injection of any of the liquids examined can result in a net porosity increase. This result reflects the fact that in each case modeled volume of dissolved quartz exceed modeled precipitate mineral volumes. Several questions must be addressed to evaluate the applicability of this conclusion. Foremost among these are: the availability of quartz within fractures, the rate of injectate heating, the kinetics of mineral precipitation/dissolution reactions, and the nature of suspended solids deposition.","","","","","","United States","1989-01-01T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: Geothermics; (USA); Journal Volume: 18:1","","Medium: X; Size: Pages: 65-72","","","","Journal ID: ISSN 0375-6505; CODEN: GTMCA","10.1016/0375-6505(89)90011-4","","2016-04-08T00:00:00Z","5416076","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/5416076","","Geothermics; (USA)","","18:1"

The data are obtained under conditions that resemble the rather sudden PbS supersaturation occurring in geothermal brines. It is concluded that PbS scale formation is strongly influenced by both pH and concentration, in the range of very small concentrations of practical interest. For a fixed PbS concentration, appreciable scale formation takes place within a limited pH range of about two units. Based on data interpretation, possible mechanisms of sulfide scale formation are suggested.","","","","","","United States","1989-01-01T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: Geothermics; (USA); Journal Volume: 18:1","","Medium: X; Size: Pages: 17-24","","","","Journal ID: ISSN 0375-6505; CODEN: GTMCA","10.1016/0375-6505(89)90005-9","","2016-05-30T00:00:00Z","5385883","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/5385883","","Geothermics; (USA)","","18:1"

These comprise 2-85% of the well scales and form at depths of 33-2620 m, where measured and fluid inclusion temperatures are 40-320{sup 0}C. Most, however, occur below the production casing show where temperatures are {ge}230{sup 0}C, often at depths coinciding with aquifers. The clay scales are compositionally and structurally different from the bentonite used in drilling, which is essentially sodium-rich montmorillonite. The clay deposits are expanding, generally disordered, and combine the characteristics of a montmorillonite, saponite and vermiculite in terms of reaction to cationic exchange treatments, structure and composition. Six types of clay scales are identified, but the predominant one, comprising 60-100% of the clay deposits in a well, is Mg- and Fe-rich and referred to as a vermiculitic species. The crystallinity, degree of disorder, textures, optical characteristics, structure and relative amounts of structural Al, Mg and Fe vary with time, temperature and fluid composition, but not with depth and measured pressure. Despite its variance from bentonite characteristics, one of the dominant suggested mechanisms of clay scale formation uses the drilling mud in the well as a substrate, from which the Mg- and Fe-rich clay evolves.","","","","","","United States","1989-01-01T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: Geothermics; (USA); Journal Volume: 18:3","","Medium: X; Size: Pages: 429-446","","","","Journal ID: ISSN 0375-6505; CODEN: GTMCA","10.1016/0375-6505(89)90067-9","","2016-05-24T00:00:00Z","5385939","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/5385939","","Geothermics; (USA)","","18:3"

While high-temperature fluids tend to deposit metal sulfides because of their high concentrations of dissolved metals and variations of temperature, pressure and fluid chemistry, low temperature media are characterized by very low metal content but much higher dissolved sulfide. In the case of the goethermal wells of the Paris Basin, detailed studies demonstrate that the relatively large concentrations of chloride and dissolved sulfide are responsible for corrosion and consequent formation of iron sulfide scale composed of mackinawite, pyrite and pyrrhotite. The effects of the exploitation schemes are far less important than the corrosion of the casings. The low-enthalpy fluids that do not originate from sedimentary aquifers (such as in Iceland and Bulgaria), have a limited corrosion potential, and the thin sulfide film that appears may prevent the progress of corrosion.","","","","","","United States","1989-01-01T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: Geothermics; (USA); Journal Volume: 18:1","","Medium: X; Size: Pages: 73-81","","","","Journal ID: ISSN 0375-6505; CODEN: GTMCA","10.1016/0375-6505(89)90012-6","","2016-04-25T00:00:00Z","5385965","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/5385965","","Geothermics; (USA)","","18:1"

The distribution and geochemistry behavior of Mn, Fe, Cu, Zn, P and Ba indicate a hydrothermal influence: (i) at plate boundaries such as the Pliny and Strabon Trenches; (ii) in fore-arc basins such as Maleas, Iraklion and Karpathos; (iii) on the Island Arc. All fore-arc basins having greater Mn enrichments than the trenches are also characterized by higher heat flow values. The greatest Mn enrichments occur at Maleas Basin where a Mn dispersion halo is recognized. This basin is very tectonically active, with the largest group of normal faults, along the planes of which magmatic material was injected, and the highest heat flow values in the Sea of Crete. It also falls in the Eastern Mediterranean Zone of high seismic activity. Because the Fe-Mn sediments identified in the above geotectonic units are the end-members of the hydrothermal fractionation sequence known from areas where leaching of oceanic crust occurs, it is suggested that other members of the sequence such as metal sulfides may be found. Significant geochemical anomalies of Pb and Zn found in areas of high heat flow and on lines of normal faulting are considered to be traces of the presence of metal sulfides.","","","","","","United States","1989-01-01T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: Geochimica et Cosmochimica Acta; (USA); Journal Volume: 53:1","","Medium: X; Size: Pages: 43-57","","","","Journal ID: ISSN 0016-7037; CODEN: GCACA","10.1016/0016-7037(89)90271-8","","2016-05-30T00:00:00Z","7262279","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/7262279","","Geochimica et Cosmochimica Acta; (USA)","","53:1"

Although some previous site-specific inventories of the geothermal resources of the Alberta Plains have been made, the study is the first comprehensive survey. Capital costs to install geothermal energy recovery operations from scratch are prohibitively high on Canada's Alberta Plains. The geothermal resources there are about 1.5 kilometers deep, and drilling wells to reach them is expensive. For a geothermal recovery operation to be economically feasible, drilling cots must be avoided. One way is through a joint-venture operation with the petroleum industry. A joint venture may be possible because oil extraction often involves the production of large volumes of hot water, a geothermal resource. Typically, after the hot water is brought to the surface with oil, it is injected underground and the heat is never used. Ways to obtain and use this heat follow.","","","","","","United States","1988-12-01T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: Geothermal Hot Line; (USA); Journal Volume: 18:2","","Medium: X; Size: Pages: 78","","","","Journal ID: ISSN 0735-0503; CODEN: GHLID","","","2009-12-17T00:00:00Z","7012876","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/7012876","","Geothermal Hot Line; (USA)","","18:2"

Solar box cookers can help to ameliorate this situation in that they use solar energy instead of wood to cook food. Usable year-round in the tropics and for 6 to 8 months of the year in most sunny areas of the world, the cookers can cook almost anything if there is 15 minutes of sunshine every hour. Developed in 1976 solar box cookers represent a major advance over early solar cookers. Solar box cookers are about the size of an ice chest, easily constructed by the users themselves and inexpensive. The cookers are made of cardboard or wood, and aluminum foil. Each box is topped with a sheet of glass above which an adjustable reflective lid is positioned to angle in sunlight. The food cooks in covered, dark-colored pans. One cooker can cook 10-15 pounds of food in three to five hours. Fruits, vegetables, meats, and any baked goods can be prepared, and water and milk pasteurized in them. The coking food does not have to be stirred and will not burn.

Announced additional funding of 8.15 million pounds will take the geothermal hot dry rock research program, centered at the Camborne project in Cornwall, on to a further stage of development. The project is described. Future development will include: a conceptual design of a deep commercial-size prototype system, commencing in October 1988; a change in emphasis in the current work program of the Camborne project so as to provide necessary detailed technical support of the conceptual design study; a new 3-year phase for the Camborne project, commencing in October 1988, aimed at developing and validating techniques for manipulating HDR reservoirs to improve and/or correct their performances; and a further major review in early 1990 to consider the case for commencing the main design and construction phase of the commercial prototype system.","","","","","","United States","1988-12-01T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: Geothermal Hot Line; (USA); Journal Volume: 18:2","","Medium: X; Size: Pages: 79-80","","","","Journal ID: ISSN 0735-0503; CODEN: GHLID","","","2009-12-17T00:00:00Z","7158598","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/7158598","","Geothermal Hot Line; (USA)","","18:2"

The goal is to develop 500 megawatts of electricity from geothermal energy on the Island of Hawaii and transmit it by underwater cable to other islands in the state, primarily to heavily populated Oahu, a distance of about 270 miles. The RFP (request for proposals) calls for development of the existing Geothermal Resource Subzones in the Kilauea East Rift Zone of the big Island's Puna District, where the demonstration plant is located. This subzone is believed to have the largest geothermal resource in the island chain. A 6,000-foot electric cable of a type that could be deployed between the islands was manufactured in 1987. Laboratory testing of the cable was concluded in October 1988, and the cable was found to be mechanically and electrically sound. At-sea testing of deployment and retrieval procedures using a surrogate, nonelectric cable will begin during the last 3 months of 1989 in the Alenuihaha Channel between the Islands of Hawaii and Maui.","","","","","","United States","1988-12-01T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: Geothermal Hot Line; (USA); Journal Volume: 18:2","","Medium: X; Size: Pages: 72-74","","","","Journal ID: ISSN 0735-0503; CODEN: GHLID","","","2009-12-17T00:00:00Z","7158614","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/7158614","","Geothermal Hot Line; (USA)","","18:2"

At 25 and 90{degree}C and TFS {approx} 0.01 molal solubility is controlled by the thioantimonite complexes H{sub 2}Sb{sub 2}S{sup 0}{sub 4}, Hsb{sub 2}S{sub 4}{sup {minus}}, Sb{sub 2}S{sup 2{minus}}{sub 4}.

The transition from thioantimonites to the hydroxothioantimonite species at approximately 120{degree}C is endothermic and is entirely driven by a gain in entropy. Stibnite solubility calculated for some geothermal fluids indicate that these fluids are undersaturated in Sb if stibnite is the solid equilibrium phase. At high temperatures (> 100{degree}C) precipitation of stibnite from ore fluids can occur in response to conductive cooling, while at low temperatures, where thioantimonites dominate, acidification of the fluid is the more likely mechanism. Precipitation of stibnite from fluids containing hydroxothioantimonite consumes H{sub 2}S and may thus trigger precipitation of other metals carried as sulfide complexes, e.g. Au(HS){sup {minus}}{sub 2}.","","","","","","United States","1988-12-01T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: Geochimica et Cosmochimica Acta; (USA); Journal Volume: 52:12","","Medium: X; Size: Pages: 3005-3015","","","","Journal ID: ISSN 0016-7037; CODEN: GCACA","10.1016/0016-7037(88)90164-0","","2016-05-03T00:00:00Z","5127052","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/5127052","","Geochimica et Cosmochimica Acta; (USA)","","52:12"

This situation is often encountered in the Overthrust Belt and in geothermal operations. Most published limited-entry analysis methods assume the existence of three flow regimes during testing if wellbore storage is small. Theoretically, the regimes are (1) an early cylindrical flow period indicative of the opened interval, (2) a short spherical transition period, and (3) the late-time cylindrical data reflecting the entire productive thickness of the reservoir. The above methods are not applicable to very thick reservoirs because field data are often dominated by wellbore storage and a long spherical flow period. In this study, an analytical solution is presented to analyze the wellbore-dominated and the spherical-flow periods. The model includes cylindrical skin of the open interval and wellbore storage. The solution and resulting type curves allow direct estimates of stimulation potential in situations where wellbore storage and spherical flow dominated pressure-transient behavior. Prior methods to determine damage require late radial-flow data and separate estimates of pseudoskin caused by flow convergence. Field examples from a gas-condensate reservoir and a geothermal well demonstrate the methods. The practical aspects of analyzing other limited-entry data are discussed.","","","Chevron Oil Field Research Co., La Habra, CA (US)","","","United States","1988-12-01T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: SPE (Society of Petroleum Engineers) Format.

Homogenization temperatures (T{sub h}) for mostly secondary fluid inclusions show variations in temperature that have occurred at give depths since precipitation of the host minerals. Within major hydrothermal upflow zones, fluid-inclusion T{sub h} values all were found to be equal to or higher (commonly 20-50 C and up to 155 C higher) than present temperatures at the depths sampled. During periods when thick glacial ice covered the Yellowstone National Park region, pore-fluid pressures in the underlying rock were increased in proportion to the weight of the overlying column of ice. Accordingly, theoretical reference boiling-point curves that reflect the maximum temperature attainable in a hot-water geothermal system at a given depth were elevated, and temperatures within zones of major hydrothermal upflow (drill holes Y-2, Y-3, Y-6, Y-11, Y-13, and upper part of Y-5) increased. The thicknesses of ice required to elevate boiling-point curves sufficiently to account for the observed fluid-inclusion T{sub h} values are within the ranges estimated by glacial geologic studies. At the margins of major hydrothermal upflow zones (drill holes Y-4 and Y-9), fluid-inclusion T{sub h} values at given depths range from 57 C lower to about the same as the current temperature measurements because of a previous decrease in the rate of discharge of warm water and/or an increase in the rate of recharge of cold water into the hydrothermal system.","","","","","","United States","1988-12-01T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: Geology; (USA); Journal Volume: 16:12","","Medium: X; Size: Pages: 1077-1080","","","","Journal ID: ISSN 0091-7613; CODEN: GLGYB","10.1130/0091-7613(1988)016<1077:EOGIOS>2.3.CO;2","","2016-04-29T00:00:00Z","7262285","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/7262285","","Geology; (USA)","","16:12"

A method for analyzing BHT data sets that directly addresses the problem of noise in the data is presented and illustrated by application to 303 BHTs from the Anschutz Ranch (AR), Cave Creek (CC), and Anschtz Ranch East (ARE) oil/gas fields in the Utah-Wyoming thrust belt, located in the Middle Rocky Mountain physiographic province of the western United States. Correction of raw BHT data by means of a Horner plot yields 81 corrected BHTs. An additional 90 BHTs, not suitable for a Horner correction, are corrected by means of a new BHT correction which may be applied to any single BHT for which a depth and time of measurement are known. The average geothermal gradient at both AR-CC and ARE is found to be 23 /sup 0/C/km, although an average-gradient analysis fails to explain scatter in the data. Analysis of corrected BHTs, through inversion of a layered-earth model, yields estimates of formation thermal gradients and temperature fields at AR-CC and ARE that are stable and unique, with an average precision of 2/sup 0/ to 3 /sup 0/C. Thermal conductivity measurements were made on 360 drill cutting samples representing 14 thrust belt formations; in situ conductivity is estimated using porosity from calibrated well logs. Heat flow is estimated by comparing temperature calculated by a two-dimensional finite element model with temperature estimated from analysis of BHT data. Analysis of BHT data from the AR-CC area yields an estimated regional heat flow of 60 mW/m/sup 2/ ( +- 8 mW/m/sup 2/); a similar analysis at ARE results in an estimate of 58 mW/m/sup 2/ ( +- 8mW/m/sup 2/).","","","Department of Geology and Geophysics, University of Utah, Salt Lake City","","","United States","1988-11-10T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: J.

High concentrations of radium, radon, and lead isotopes are generated and maintained by the input of these isotopes from solid phases into brine by both recoil and leaching processes, by the high chloride content of the brine which complexes radium and lead, and by the apparent absence of suitable unoccupied adsorption sites. In contrast, uranium, thorium, actinium, bismuth, and polonium isotopes all have low concentrations due to their efficient sorption from brine to rock. Measurements of short-lived isotopes in these decay series yield insights regarding the mechanisms controlling radioisotope exchange, and they permit estimation of rates of brine-rock interaction. For example, the /sup 228/Ac//sup 228/Ra activity ratio of 0.2 in brines indicates that the mean residence time of actinium in solution before sorption onto solid surfaces is less than 2.5 hours.","","","Department of Geological Sciences, University of Southern California, Los Angeles","","","United States","1988-11-10T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: J.

Use of a three-component geophone, along with rotation of the recorded data traces into a wave front-based coordinate system, allows analysis of many aspects of seismic wave propagation properties around the well. Standard VSP analysis techniques were used to measure interval P and S wave velocities and to identify reflecting horizons both within and below the survey interval (from 455 to 1735 m). A reflection from below the survey interval, seen with both P and S sources, seems to be associated with a fractured reservoir near 2100 m. Indications of fracturing were observed, including vertical scattering of P waves from a zone near 915 m. Orthogonally polarized shear waves were generated at each offset to study anisotropy by travel time measurement and particle motion analysis of the shear wave arrivals. Three component particle motion analysis of shear wave arrivals was found to be effective for characterizing the subtleties in the S wave splitting throughout the various zones in the well. The SH/sub t/ source (horizontal and transverse to the well) produced complicated, elliptical particle motion while the SV source (in-line with the well) produced linear particle motion. The difference in linearity of particle motion from orthogonally polarized shear wave sources was unexpected and may be related to regional tectonics. Anomalous zones may be related to transition depths in the Salton Sea geothermal field. Travel time difference between SV and SH waves, while clearly observable, indicates only about 1% average anisotropy.","","","Center for Computational Seismology, Lawrence Berkeley Laboratory, University of California, Berkeley","","","United States","1988-11-10T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: J.

Other gravel-pack materials tested include Ottawa sand, sintered bauxite, cement clinker, zirconium oxide, and nickel pellets. A comparison was made between the performances of these materials after exposure to identical thermal and hydrolytic conditions. Test results indicate that nickel-coated sands are highly resistant to dissolution at temperatures as high as 300/sup 0/C (570/sup 0/F) and to solution pH's from 4.75 to 11. Weight losses measured after a 72-hour period were less than 1%. In contrast, weight losses from sintered bauxite, zirconium oxide, and Ottawa sand dissolution tests were 30 to 70 times higher under the same conditions. Cement clinker losses were in the intermediate range under alkaline conditions. API standard crushing and acid-solubility tests for proppants also were performed on nickel-coated sands. These results were favorable in that they exceeded the recommended standards.

The only evidence for their presence is from their geophysical signatures on regional gravity, seismic and electromagnetic surveys. Recently, a surge of interest has focused studies in the western moat, where the volcanism is most recent, and where many workers feel that the geothermal potential is highest. A detailed, narrow-band (20--80 s) magnetotelluric profile in that area has delineated a parallel set of buried high angle normal faults which have virtually no expression at the surface. The outermost fault has a throw of approximately 500 m, while the innermost has a throw of approximately 2 km; neither has an expression in the surface morphology. Moreover, based on a relatively low resistivity contrast between the basement and the basin fill, we infer a relatively high fracture porosity in the Sierran basement, which suggests that there may be considerable lateral and vertical migration of meteoric water; a result which has considerable significance to understanding the regional hydrology. copyright American Geophysical Union 1988","","","Department of Geological Sciences, Brown University","","","United States","1988-11-01T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: Geophys.

A combined technique of a pressure build-up test of geothermal p production wells and the downhole AE measurement has been developed and effectively used to reveal a structure and behaviour of geothermal reservoir system at Kakkonda field in Japan. AE evaluation and control of hydraulic stimulation of geothermal well drilling and other applications by using the downhole AE technique are now being investigated.","","","","","","United States","1988-10-01T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: Journal of Acoustic Emission; (USA); Journal Volume: 7:4","","Medium: X; Size: Pages: 201-209","","","","Journal ID: ISSN 0730-0050; CODEN: JACED","","","2009-12-17T00:00:00Z","6969749","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/6969749","","Journal of Acoustic Emission; (USA)","","7:4"

Results of an 8-day, near-field, single-trap experiment and a 340-day, multi-instrument, 5-trap deployment two kilometers from the Endeavour Ridge vent field show variability in the quantity and composition of the plume-to-sediment particle flux over time, with depth, and with distance from the vent field. Hydrothermal elemental fluxes vary by a factor of two among the four sampling intervals of the longer experiment; a factor of three variation in Fe/S among these periods reflects temporal changes in phase composition. Changes in flux with depth--for example, a 200-fold increase in Cu and Zn between above- and below-plume traps are evidence of hydrothermal input. Comparison of fluxes determined in the near- and far-field experiments reveals the spatial influence of vent effluent. Near-field particle flux exceeds that measured two kilometers away by a factor of 10 to 20 and is relatively enriched in Fe, Cu, and organic carbon, but depleted in Mn. Calculations of the residence time of the plume with respect to settling indicate that more than 90 percent of the particulate material is transported farther than two kilometers from the vent field. Interpretation of elemental, mineralogical, and grain-size analyses suggest that chemical precipitation kinetics, other physical and biological particle-forming processes, changes in vent output, and lateral transport of hydrothermal material by abyssal currents are tenable explanations for the authors' observations. Their findings suggest that these rage-interdependent processes be included in realistic models of hydrothermal particle flux.","","","","","","United States","1988-10-01T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: Geochimica et Cosmochimica Acta; (USA); Journal Volume: 52:10","","Medium: X; Size: Pages: 2525-2536","","","","Journal ID: ISSN 0016-7037; CODEN: GCACA","10.1016/0016-7037(88)90310-9","","2016-05-16T00:00:00Z","5269925","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/5269925","","Geochimica et Cosmochimica Acta; (USA)","","52:10"

Using the ion-interaction or virial coefficient approach developed by Pitzer (1973, 1979, 1987) and coworkers, and approximating the pressure-dependencies of the various Na{sub 2}SO{sub 4}(aq) thermodynamic quantities with those of NaCl(aq) calculated from the equations of Rogers and Pitzer (1982), the authors measured heat capacities were combined with literature values on heat capacities, enthalpies, and osmotic coefficients at temperatures to 225{degree}C and at pressures mostly at 1 bar or vapor-saturation pressure to yield a comprehensive set of equations for the thermodynamic properties of Na{sub 2}SO{sub 4}(aq) at temperatures 25{degree}-300{degree}C, pressure to at least 200 bars, and molalities to 3.0 mol{center dot}kg{sup minus 1}. Good agreement between experimental and predicted solubilities in water indicate that the ion-interaction model can be used successfully to predict mineral-solution equilibria to 300{degree}C without an explicit accounting for ion-pairs, and demonstrates that heat capacity measurements can be used to obtain reliable high-temperature and high-pressure activity properties of electrolyte solutions. The binary and ternary mixing parameters {theta}{sub ij} and {psi}{sub ijk} are required by the ion-interaction model for calculations for multicomponent mixtures. It was found sufficient to adopt previously determined values for {theta}{sub ij} at 25{degree}C without temperature dependence and, from the solubility data, to determine temperature-dependent {psi}{sub ijk} functions.","","","","","","United States","1988-10-01T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: Geochimica et Cosmochimica Acta; (USA); Journal Volume: 52:10","","Medium: X; Size: Pages: 2393-2404","","","AC03-76SF00098","Journal ID: ISSN 0016-7037; CODEN: GCACA","10.1016/0016-7037(88)90296-7","","2016-05-09T00:00:00Z","5204260","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/5204260","","Geochimica et Cosmochimica Acta; (USA)","","52:10"

From the surface downward, the geoelectrical units are (1) very resistive, young, unaltered volcanic rock, (2) a conductive layer of older volcanic material composed of altered tuffs, (3) a thick resistive layer thought to be in part intrusive rocks, and (4) a lower-crustal conductor. This model is similar to the regional geoelectrical structure found through the Cascade Range. Inside the caldera, the conductive second layer corresponds to the steep temperature gradient and alteration minerals observed in the USGS Newberry 2 test hole. Drill hole information on the south and north flanks of the volcano (test holes GES N-1 and GEO N-3, respectively) indicates that outside the caldera the conductor is due to alteration minerals (primarily smectite) and not high-temperature pore fluids.

Model calculations of the gravity anomaly field suggest that the volcano is underlain by an intrusive complex of mafic composition of about 20-km diameter and 2-km thickness, at depths above 4 km below sea level. However, uplifted basement in a northwest trending ridge may form part of the underlying excess mass, thus reducing the volume of the subvolcanic intrusive. A ring dike of mafic composition is inferred to intrude to near-surface levels along the caldera ring fractures, and low-density fill of the caldera floor probably has a thickness of 0.7--0.9 km. The gravity anomaly attributable to the volcano is reduced to the east across a north-northwest trending gravity anomaly gradient through Newberry caldera and suggests that normal, perhaps extensional, faulting has occurred subsequent to caldera formation and may have controlled the location of some late-stage basaltic and rhyolitic eruptions.

Numerical simulations begin with emplacement of a small magma body, the presumed source of silicic eruptions at Newberry that began about 10,000 B.P., into a thermal regime representing 100,000 years of cooling of a large underlying intrusion. Simulated flow patterns and thermal histories for three sets of hypothetical permeability values are compatible with data from four geothermal drill holes on the volcano. Meteoric recharge cools the caldera-fill deposits, but thermal water moving up a central conduit representing a permeable volcanic vent produces temperatures close to those observed in drill holes within the caldera. Meteoric recharge from the caldera moves down the flanks and creates a near-isothermal zone that extends several hundred meters below the water table, producing temperature profiles similar to those observed in drill holes on the flanks. The temperatures observed in drill holes on the flanks are not influenced by the postulated Holocene magma body. The elevated temperature gradients measured in the lower portions of these holes may be related to the cumulative effect of older intrusions. The models also indicate that meteoric recharge to the deep hydrothermal system probably originates within or near the caldera. Relatively low fluid velocities at depth suggest that at least a significant fraction of the thermal fluid may be very old.","","","U.S. Geological Survey, Menlo Park, California","","","United States","1988-09-10T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: J.

Holocene rhyolitic eruptions (1) have been confined mainly within the caldera in an area 5 km in diameter, (2) have been very similar in chemical composition, phenocryst mineralogy, and eruptive style, and (3) have occurred as recently as 1300 years ago, with repose periods of 2000--3000 years between eruptions. Holocene basaltic andesite eruptions are widespread on the flanks but are excluded from the area of rhyolitic volcanism. Basaltic andesite in fissures at the edge of the rhyolite area has silicic inclusions and shows mixed basalt-rhyolite magma relations. These geologic relations and the high geothermal gradient that characterizes the lower part of a drill hole in the caldera (U.S. Geological Survey Newberry 2) indicate that a rhyolitic magma chamber has existed beneath the caldera throughout the Holocene.

East and west of Newberry Volcano, the subvolcanic basement (5.6 km/s) has been downwarped, producing 5-km-deep basins. The midcrust (8- to 28-km depth) is characterized by velocities ranging from 6.1 to 6.5 km/s and varies laterally in thicknesses. The lowercrust is characterized by an unusually high velocity (about 7.4 km/s), and its geometry mirrors the subvolcanic basement geometry. The Moho is located at a depth of 37 km and represents a transition to an upper mantle velocity of 8.1 km/s. The shallow subsurface (1.2 km) beneath Newberry Volcano is characterized by high-velocity (5.6 km/s, versus 4.1 km/s for the surrounding area) intrusions and appears to be located on a basement high. Beneath the seismic fraction array at Newberry Volcano, an absence of low-velocity anomalies suggests that large silicic magma chambers do not exist in the upper crust, but apparent high attenuation of the seismic wave field may be consistent with either partial melts in small volumes, elevated crustal temperatures, and/or poor geophone-recording site coupling. The east central Oregon velocity structure is nearly identical to that of the northwestern Nevada Basin and Range and the Modoc Plateau of northeastern California, and variations in the deep crustal structure about Newberry Volcano are consistent with tectonism involving crustal underplating, melting, and extension.","","","U.S. Geological Survey, Menlo Park, California Department of Geophysics, Standford University, California","","","United States","1988-09-10T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: J.

The upper part of the stratigraphic section pentrated by Newberry 2 consists of caldera fill below which are increasingly more mafic lavas ranging from rhyodacite at 501 m to basalt at 932 m. Measured temperatures shallower than 300 m are less than 35/sup 0/C, and rock alteration consists of hydration of glass and local palagonitization of basaltic tuffs. Incipient zeolitization and partial smectite replacement of ash and pumice occurred throughout the pumiceous lithic tuffs from 300 to 500 m. Higher-temperature alteration of the tuffs to chlorite and mordenite occurs adjacent to a rhyodacite sill at 460--470 m; alteration minerals within the sill consist of pyrrhotite, pyrite, quartz, calcite, and siderite. Below 697 m the rocks are progressively more altered with depth mainly because of increased temperature along a conductive gradient from 100/sup 0/C at 697 m to 265/sup 0/C at 930 m.

Drilling has encountered temperatures indicative of a hydrothermal system above the hypothesized magma body. On the basis of hydrothermal mineralogy the temperature of the hydrothermal system is at or near its maximum value, indicating that the hydrothermal system is young. Basaltic underplating is postulated to replenish the magma body. The results of interdisciplinary studies at Newberry Volcano document that young, silicic volcanism in the Cascade Range can have geothermal potential. These results should be applied with caution to the rest of the Cascade Range because of the strong influence of Basin and Range extensional tectonics on Newberry Volcano's style of volcanism.","","","U.S. Geological Survey, Denver, Colorado","","","United States","1988-09-10T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: J.

Newberry Volcano is a bimodal shield volcano east of the axis of the Cascade Range. It is associated both with the Cascade Range and with northwest migrating silicic volcanism in southeast Oregon. High-frequency (approx.7 Hz) crustal phases, nominally Pg and a midcrustal reflected phase, travel upward through a target volume beneath Newberry Volcano to a dense array of 120 seismographs. This arrangement is limited by station spacing to 1- to 2-km resolution in the upper 5 to 6 km of the crust beneath the volcano's summit caldera. The experiment tests the hypothesis that Cascade Range volcanoes are underlain only by small magma chambers. A small low-velocity anomaly delineated abosut 3 km below the summit caldera supports this hypothesis for Newberry Volcano and is interpreted as a possible magma chamber of a few to a few tens of km/sup 3/ in volume. A ring-shaped high-velocity anomaly nearer the surface coincides with the inner mapped ring fractures of the caldera. It also coincides with a circular gravity high, and we interpret it as largely subsolidus silicic cone sheets. The presence of this anomaly and of silicic vents along the ring fractures suggests that the fractures are a likely eruption path between the small magma chamber and the surface.","","","U.S. Geological Survey, Menlo Park, California","","","United States","1988-09-10T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: J.

An inner layer next to the basalt surface is an Al-rich interlayered smectite/chlorite similar to high temperature Al-rich clays recovered from the East Pacific Rise, 21{degree}N with minor quartz, zeolite (phillipsite ) and relict plagioclase. An exterior layer of boehmite, AlO(OH) and minor anatase results from severe leaching of the underlying clays. The alteration crust is progressively enriched in Al, Ti, V, and Cr from interior to exterior by residual weathering. The presence of boehmite and absence of a silica-rich phase in the exterior of the crust indicates the hydrothermal fluids were silica undersaturated or silica was maintained in solution by extremely acidic fluids.

This difference gives rise to characteristic shapes of the variation of the instability constants on temperature plots. Trends in the calculated equilibrium constants and enthalpies and entropies of reactions are consistent with changes in the thermodynamic and electrostatic properties of the solvent with temperature rise. Limitations of the method include questionable low temperature thermodynamic data, lack of additional model equilibria, and lack of proof of the general validity of the method above 300{degree}C.

The 52-km-wide crater occurs in Precambrian Dala series granites. Deep drilling in the crater provides samples from depths down to 6000 m; these are supplemented by surface samples from the crater and surrounding regions. Secondary fluid inclusions occur in matrix quartz of nearly all granites examined. Most inclusions contain low-salinity water and water vapor; no CH/sub 4/ or H/sub 2/ has been detected. In surface samples, peak trapping temperatures are 327-342/sup 0/C on the crater's inner plateau, and minimum trapping temperatures are 135-225/sup 0/C near the annular moat. In the subsurface, trapping temperatures distinguish two sample populations separated by a flat-lying 60-m-thick dolerite at 1200 m below sea level. In the deep sample group below -1200 m, estimated trapping temperatures increase with depth along gradients between 17 and 32/sup 0/C/km, from 250-300/sup 0/C just below the dolerite to 320-440/sup 0/C at -5711 m. Trapping temperatures in samples above -1200 m are hotter than would be predicted by extrapolation of the deep trends and are believed to reflect hydrothermal activity generated by impact heating. This interpretation is supported by the presence of hotter temperatures of fluid-inclusion trapping in samples from inside the crater compared to outside, and by crosscutting relations which show that some fluid-inclusion trails postdate impact-related features such as planar elements in quartz. Impact-heated fluids circulated through a circular domain of rock approximately 52 km wide and at least 1.2 km thick. The large scale of this circulation system indicates that impact-generated hydrothermal activity can be a significant mechanism for heat dissipation following bolide impacts on water-bearing planets.","","","Univ. of Wisconsin, Madison (USA)","","","United States","1988-08-01T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: Geology; (United States); Journal Volume: 16:8","","Medium: X; Size: Pages: 711-715","","","","Journal ID: CODEN: GLGYB","10.1130/0091-7613(1988)016<0711:FIEFIH>2.3.CO;2","","2016-05-16T00:00:00Z","7054685","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/7054685","","Geology; (United States)","","16:8"

Past studies of the geothermal regime in the Western Canada Sedimentary Basin have shown the existence of a low geothermal gradient (low heat flux area) in the foothills region of southwestern Alberta, and of a high geothermal gradient (high heat flux area) in the lowlands in northeastern Alberta, close to the Precambrian Shield. These distributions of geothermal gradients and heat fluxes were attributed to the effects of basin wide groundwater flow. Hydrogeological studies in selected parts of the basin, and dimensional analysis applied to heat transfer processes show that the permeability of the sediments, and indeed the fluid velocities, are too low to play a significant role in the transport of terrestrial heat in the Alberta part of the Western Canada Sedimentary Basin. On a regional scale, the actual distributions of the heat flux and geothermal gradients are probably due to crustal thickening and/or increased radiogenic heat generation in the basement. Thermal anomalies, which may be due to granitic intrusions, are superimposed over this trend. At an intermediate scale, the geothermal field is controlled by topography, stratigraphy, and lithology of the sediments. Only on a local scale is the convection of heat important. copyright American Geophysical Union 1988","","","Alberta Research Council, Edmonton, Alberta, Canada","","","United States","1988-07-10T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: J.

The deeper the sample collection within the spring, the greater the enrichment in Kr, Xe, radiogenic {sup 4}He, and {sup 40}Ar and the greater the depletion in Ne relative to {sup 36}Ar. The compositional variations are consistent with multi-component mixing. The dominant component consists of dissolved atmospheric gases acquired by the pool at the surface in contact with air. This component is mixed in varying degree with two other components, one each for gas and water entering the bottom of the pool. The two bottom components are not in equilibrium. In Horseshoe Spring, the bubbles entering at the bottom strip the atmospheric-derived pool gases from the surrounding water while en route to the surface. If the original bottom bubbles are noble gas, as in the case of Horseshoe, the acquired pool gases can then quickly obliterate the original bubble composition.

The /sup 87/Sr//sup 86/Sr values of other rocks sampled in the Jemez Mountains have also been used in this study to understand relations between the fluids and rocks of the volcanically driven geothermal system and the lateral outflow plume, discharging down the Jemez fault zone. The strontium content of ground-water is linked to the host rock composition, the aquifer temperature, and therefore the solubility of Sr-containing minerals. Low Sr concentrations in the fluid are found with a high temperature and/or volcanic host rocks, whereas high Sr concentrations are characteristic of a low temperature and/or a Paloezoic sedimentary aquifer. Important variations of the /sup 87/Sr//sup 86/Sr value in hydrothermal waters (0.70842--0.72193) are related to chemical composition, Sr content, and host rocks. For VC-1 core samples, the Sr isotopic ratios are also markedly variable (0.70459--0.75686), low for the Quaternary volcanics and high for the Paleozoic sedimentary rocks. The same observation is made for other Jemez Mountains rocks (0.70465--0.8163) with, in addition, high /sup 87/Sr//sup 86/Sr values for Precambrian crystalline rocks.

Hydrologic data suggest that 25--50% of the discharge of the Valles outflow is confined to the Jemez fault zone, which predates caldera formation. Thermal gradient data from bores penetrating the plume show that shallow gradients are highest in the vicinity of the Jemez fault zone (up to 190 /sup 0/C/km). Shallow heat flow above the hydrothermal plume is as high as 500 mW m/sup -2/ near core hole VC-1 (Jemez fault zone) to 200 mW m/sup -2/ at Fenton Hill (Jemez Plateau). Chemical and isotopic data indicate that two source reservoirs within the caldera (Redondo Creek and Sulphur Springs reservoirs) are parents to mixed fluids flowing in the hydrothermal plume. However, isotopic data, borehole data, basic geology, and inverse relations between temperature and chloride content at major hot springs indicate that no single reservoir fluid and no single diluting fluid are involved in mixing. The Valles caldera hydrothermal plume is structurally dominated by lateral flow through a belt of vertical conduits (Jemez fault zone) that strike away from the source reservoir. Stratigraphically confined flow is present but dispersed over a wide area in relatively impermeable rocks. The Valles configuration is contrasted with the configuration of the hydrothermal plume at Roosevelt Hot Springs, which is dominated by lateral flow through a near-surface, widespread, permeable aquifer. Data from 12 other representative geothermal systems show that outflow plumes occur in a variety of magmatic and tectonic settings, have varying reservoir compositions, and have different flow characteristics.","","","Los Alamos National Laboratory, New Mexico","","","United States","1988-06-10T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: J.

These centers are the sites of major hydrothermal activity and upper crystal metamorphism, metasomatism, and mineralization, producing associated geothermal resources. We present new heat flow data from Valles caldera core hole 1 (VC-1), drilled in the southwestern margin of the Valles caldera. Thermal conductivities were measured on 55 segments of core from VC-1, waxed and wrapped to preserve fluids. These values were combined with temperature gradient data to calculate heat flow. Above 335 m, which is probably unsaturated, heat flow is 247 +- 16 mW m/sup -2/. The only deep temperature information available is from an uncalibrated commercial log made 19 months after drilling. Gradients, derived from uncalibrated temperature logs, and conductivities are inversely correlated between 335 and 737 m, indicating a conductive thermal regime, and component heat fluxes over three depth intervals (335--539 m, 549--628 m, and 628--737 m) are in excellent agreement with each other with an average of 504 +- 15 mW m/sup -2/. Temperature logs to 518 m depth with well-calibrated temperature sensors result in a revised heat flow of 463 +- 15 mW m. We use shallow thermal gradient data from 75 other sites in and around the caldera to interpret the thermal regime at the VC-1 site. A critical review of published thermal conductivity data from the Valles caldera yields an average thermal conductivity of greater than or equal to1 W m/sup -1/ K/sup -1/ for the near-surface tuffaceous material, and we assume that shallow gradient values (/sup 0/C km/sup -1/) are approximately numerically equal to heat flow (mW m/sup -2/).","","","U.S. Geological Survey, Flagstaff, Arizona","","","United States","1988-06-10T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: J.

Data are analyzed by conventional log-log type-curve matching techniques, followed by application of recently developed semilog type-curve matching techniques that allow linear boundary detection without developing two semilog straight lines. One type curve exists for each of the drawdown and buildup data, which are produced by mathematically collapsing the family of curves produced in the solution for a system containing a line source and linear boundary. The type curve for the buildup data has not been previously published. The method allows the inference ellipse for a linear boundary to be determined without any knowledge of reservoir parameters. The data in some tests show the presence of a no-flow boundary for which inference ellipses have been located.

The interaction mechanism between the forced flow and the buoyant effects is examined for wide ranges of Rayleigh number Ra* and Peclet number Pe*. The external flow significantly perturbs the buoyancy-induced temperature and flow fields when Pe* is increased beyond unity. For a fixed Peclet number, an increase in Rayleigh number produces multicellular recirculating flows in a domain close to the heat source. This enhances heat transfer by free convection. However, for a fixed Ra*, an increase in forced flow or Peclet number does not necessarily increase the heat transfer rate. Hence, there exists a critical Peclet number as a function of Ra* for which the overall Nusselt number is minimum. The heat transfer is, generally, dominated by the buoyant flows for Pe* < 1 whereas the contribution of free convection is small for Pe* 10 when Ra* {le} 10.","","","","","","United States","1988-05-01T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: Journal of Heat Transfer (Transcations of the ASME (American Society of Mechanical Engineers), Series C); (United States); Journal Volume: 110:2","","Medium: X; Size: Pages: 395-402","","","","Journal ID: ISSN 0022-1481; CODEN: JHTRA","10.1115/1.3250498","","2016-05-23T00:00:00Z","5488991","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/5488991","","Journal of Heat Transfer (Transcations of the ASME (American Society of Mechanical Engineers), Series C); (United States)","","110:2"

SV and P wave amplitudes were measured from vertical component seismograms of earthquakes that occurred in the Coso-southern Sierra Nevada region from July 1983 to 1985. Seismograms of 16 small earthquakes show SV amplitudes which are greatly diminished at some azimuths and takeoff angles, indicating strong lateral variations in S wave attenuation in the area. Three-dimensional images of the relative S wave attenuation structure are obtained from forward modeling and a back projection inversion of the amplitude data. The results indicate regions within a 20 by 30 by 10 km volume of the shallow crust (one shallower than 5 km) that severely attenuate SV waves passing through them. These anomalies lie beneath the Indian Wells Valley 30 km south of the Coso volcanic field, and are coincident with the epicentral locations of recent earthquake swarms. No anomalous attenuation is seen beneath the Coso volcanic field above about 5 km depth.

"The solubility of hydrogen sulfide in 0-5 m NaCl solutions at 25 degree -95 degree C and one atmosphere","Barrett, T J; Anderson, G M; Lugowski, J","15 GEOTHERMAL ENERGY; 58 GEOSCIENCES; 37 INORGANIC, ORGANIC, PHYSICAL AND ANALYTICAL CHEMISTRY; BRINES; ROCK-FLUID INTERACTIONS; SOLVENT PROPERTIES; GROUND WATER; HYDROGEN SULFIDES; CHEMICAL ACTIVATION; SOLUBILITY; ACTIVATION ENERGY; CHEMICAL REACTION KINETICS; DISSOLUTION; EXPERIMENTAL DATA; GEOTHERMAL FLUIDS; PH VALUE; PRESSURE EFFECTS; SODIUM CHLORIDES; SOLUTIONS; TEMPERATURE EFFECTS; ALKALI METAL COMPOUNDS; CHALCOGENIDES; CHLORIDES; CHLORINE COMPOUNDS; DATA; DISPERSIONS; ENERGY; FLUIDS; HALIDES; HALOGEN COMPOUNDS; HYDROGEN COMPOUNDS; INFORMATION; KINETICS; MIXTURES; NUMERICAL DATA; OXYGEN COMPOUNDS; REACTION KINETICS; SODIUM COMPOUNDS; SULFIDES; SULFUR COMPOUNDS; WATER; 152003* - Geothermal Data & Theory- Rock-Water-Gas Interactions; 580000 - Geosciences; 400201 - Chemical & Physicochemical Properties","Aqueous hydrogen sulfide solubilities have been determined for distilled water and 1-5 m NaCl brines at temperatures of 25{degree}-95{degree}C at atmospheric pressure. From the experimental data, a set of polynomial equations has been derived which can be used to calculate H{sub 2}S solubilities for any temperature up to 95{degree}C and NaCl content up to 5 molal. The results can be applied to the behavior of H{sub 2}S in natural systems ranging from normal groundwaters to low-temperature geothermal brines; they also allow more accurate calculation of metal sulfide solubilities in acid solutions below 100{degree}C. From the solubility data, activity coefficients of H{sub 2}S have been calculated. For a given gas and temperature, the relation between activity coefficient values {gamma}{sub n} and the true ionic strength I is given by the slope b{sub {gamma},n}. For H{sub 2}S b{sub {gamma},n} is 0.0745 for the 25{degree}-80{degree}C data; values increase to 0.109 at 95{degree}C. H{sub 2}S solubilities were also calculated for the authors' experimental conditions using an equation presented by Barta and Bradley (1985) which is based on data obtained by Drummond (1981) under higher P-T conditions. Calculated values generally show good agreement with our measured results.","","","","","","United States","1988-04-01T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: Geochimica et Cosmochimica Acta; (USA); Journal Volume: 52:4","","Medium: X; Size: Pages: 807-811","","","","Journal ID: ISSN 0016-7037; CODEN: GCACA","10.1016/0016-7037(88)90352-3","","2016-05-10T00:00:00Z","5204212","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/5204212","","Geochimica et Cosmochimica Acta; (USA)","","52:4"

Using recent literature values for the stability constants of the chloride complexes of Zn and Pb up to 300{degree}C, the authors have calculated ZnS and PbS solubilities over the 25-300{degree}C and 1-5 m NaCl range. Field data from various geothermal systems have been used to calculate equilibrium solubilities of sphalerite and galena in these systems. High-salinity brines appear to range from supersaturated (Salton Sea, high-temperature) to strongly supersaturated (Red Sea, low temperature) with respect to these sulfides. By contrast, high-temperature seawater-salinity solutions at sediment-free spreading axes are grossly undersaturated in sphalerite and galena. The latter situation is of interest in that massive sulfide deposits are nevertheless forming from such solutions. On the other hand, vent fluids depositing sulfides at the sediment-covered axis in the Guaymas Basin appear to be near saturation in sphalerite and galena. This is probably related to the higher pH of these fluids, and the higher metal contents of the underlying sediments relative to basalts. Calculated solubilities for on-land geothermal systems yield values in reasonable agreement (<0.2 log units) in two of three cases.","","","","","","United States","1988-04-01T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: Geochimica et Cosmochimica Acta; (USA); Journal Volume: 52:4","","Medium: X; Size: Pages: 813-820","","","","Journal ID: ISSN 0016-7037; CODEN: GCACA","10.1016/0016-7037(88)90353-5","","2016-05-17T00:00:00Z","5327375","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/5327375","","Geochimica et Cosmochimica Acta; (USA)","","52:4"

Sulfides from three sediment-starved sites on the Juan de Fuca Ridge contain Pb with isotope ratios identical to their local basaltic sources. Lead in two deposits from the sediment-covered Escanaba Trough, Gorda Ridge, is derived from the sediments and does not appear to contain any basaltic component. There is a range of isotope ratios in a Guaymas Basin deposit, consistent with a mixture of sediment and MOR basalt Pb. Lead in a Galapagos deposit differs slightly from known Galapagos basalt Pb isotope values. The faithful record of Pb isotope signatures of local sources in MOR sulfides indicates that isotope ratios from ancient analogues ca be used as accurate reflections of ancient oceanic crustal values in ophiolite-hosted deposits and continental crustal averages in sediment-hosted deposits. The preservation of primary ophiolitic or continental crustal Pb isotope signatures in ancient MOR sulfides provides a powerful tool for investigation of crustal evolution and for fingerprinting ancient terranes.","","","Lamont-Doherty Geological Observatory, Palisades, NY (USA)","","","United States","1988-04-01T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: Geology; (United States); Journal Volume: 16:4","","Medium: X; Size: Pages: 362-365","","","","Journal ID: CODEN: GLGYB","10.1130/0091-7613(1988)016<0362:PIISFM>2.3.CO;2","","2016-05-19T00:00:00Z","7177372","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/7177372","","Geology; (United States)","","16:4"

The method presented here is limited to the P-T range of the fitted experimental data, and cannot represent accurately P-V-T data close to the critical region. This virial equation treatment yields simple analytical expressions that are suitable for multicomponent equilibrium calculations. Examples of equilibrium calculations between aqueous and gas phases show that ideal mixing of real gases is a sufficient approximation for modeling boiling in geothermal and epithermal systems. However, non-ideal mixing has to be considered for aqueous-gas systems at pressures much higher than the saturation pressure of pure water.","","","","","","United States","1988-03-01T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: Geochimica et Cosmochimica Acta; (USA); Journal Volume: 52:3","","Medium: X; Size: Pages: 739-749","","","","Journal ID: ISSN 0016-7037; CODEN: GCACA","10.1016/0016-7037(88)90334-1","","2016-05-06T00:00:00Z","5327837","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/5327837","","Geochimica et Cosmochimica Acta; (USA)","","52:3"

It has become apparent that there are many cases in which constant-pressure production is more common. Gas wells, geothermal wells, and even oil wells are operated at constant pressure during most of their producing life. Constant-pressure well-test data for fractured wells are commonly analyzed using type-curve-matching techniques that may result in nonunique solutions. By the use of a semianalytic model, a set of correlations has been developed that reduces the nonuniqueness problem, as well as accounts for well-test data in which the well is produced at high rates. When applied to high-flow-rate wells, this technique uses the bilinear flow period to determine an apparent fracture conductivity for constant-pressure drawdown or buildup tests. These apparent values can be corrected to true conductivities by the use of correlations presented in this study. These relationships were derived through computer simulation of a wide range of possible situations. In summary, this paper presents for the first time a technique that analyzes buildup and drawdown data from wells produced at constant pressure with turbulent flow in the fracture. Two example applications, one for buildup and one for drawdown, are included to demonstrate the use of these techniques.","","","Univ. of Southern California (US)","","","United States","1988-03-01T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: SPE (Society of Petroleum Engineers) Format.

The principal methods used for characterizing the labradorite dissolution were high lateral resolution scanning Auger microscopy (SAM), X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS), and measurement of the exit solution chemistry. Under these hydrothermal conditions, boehmite and halloysite precipitate throughout the core and the labradorite powder undergoes extensive dissolution. The reacted labradorite surfaces are incongruently modified to levels as deep as 20 A (for Al and Si) to 30 A (for Na and Ca), although the distribution of elements within this depth or deeper is not yet know. The modified surface chemistry not only changes systematically down the length of the core, but is also locally variable. The dissolution mechanism of labradorite under hydrothermal conditions as revealed by SAM is highly complex, and the variability in surface chemistry is probably controlled by the local density and distribution of microcracks and crystal defects, the starting morphology of each labradorite surface, and the local flow patterns of reacting solution over that surface. Our results are contrary to previous XPS studies of dissolving feldspars (at or near room temperature) which do not report dramatic changes in near-surface chemistries. Part of the difference between the XPS and Auger results may be due to the difference in the depth of analysis associated with the characteristic electrons utilized by the two techniques.","","","Stanford Univ., CA (USA)","","","United States","1988-02-01T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: Geochim.

An evaluation of published fluid analyses from geothermal systems indicates that the As content of the reservoir fluids varies inversely with P/sub H/sub 2/S/ and directly with temperature. Aqueous As species occur in two oxidation states, As/sup III/ and As/sup V/. As/sup III/ predominates in the reservoir fluids, where H/sub 3/AsO/sub 3/ is inferred to be the dominant aqueous species. Both AS/sup III/ and As/sup V/ occur in hot spring fluids. The concentration of As in high-temperature reservoir fluids is regulated by reactions involving pyrite. Concentrations up to 3.8 weight percent As have been measured in pyrite from two systems. The erratic distribution of As in the samples studied is interpreted as resulting from local fluctuations in redox conditions. Arsenopyrite and other As minerals are undersaturated with respect to the high temperature fluids found in most reservoirs. In contrast, orpiment, realgar, As-rich stibnite and marcasite, and iron oxides control the deposition of As in hot spring environments.

The authors analysis resulted in a three-dimensional characterization of temperature distributions in a large portion of the basin in south Texas and numerical models of representative cross sections of this area. In three dimensions, the most prominent thermal feature in the south Texas subsurface is a band of high temperatures that corresponds to the Wilcox growth-fault trend. A similar but greatly subdued band corresponds to the Vicksburg-Frio growth-fault trend. Indications from temperature profiles and from modeling are that these temperature bands are controlled by the advection of fluids from the deep basin upward along the growth-fault zone. The source of the fluids appears to be quite deep, over 12,000 ft (4000 m) below the surface. In addition, temperatures generally increase from the northeast to the southwest within the area. This trend is presumably created by variation in basement heat flux. 17 figures, 1 table.","","","Weiss Associates, Oakland, CA (USA)","","","United States","1988-01-01T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: AAPG Bull.; (United States); Journal Volume: 72:1","","Medium: X; Size: Pages: 21-32","","","","Journal ID: CODEN: AABUD","","","2009-12-17T00:00:00Z","6653158","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/6653158","","AAPG Bull.; (United States)","","72:1"

The objectives of the SSSDP were (1) to drill a deep well into the Salton Sea Geothermal Field in the Imperial Valley of California, (2) to retrieve a high percentage of core and cuttings along the entire depth of the well, (3) to obtain a comprehensive suite of geophysical logs, (4) to conduct flow tests at two depths (and to take fluid samples therefrom), and (5) to carry out several downhole experiments. These activities enabled the U.S. Geological Survey and cooperating agencies to study the physical and chemical processes involved in an active hydrothermal system driven by a molten-rock heat source. The SSSDP exceeded its target depth of 10,000 feet, and a comprehensive set of cuttings, cores, and downhole logs was obtained. Two flow tests at different depths were successfully completed. Hydrologic connection between the different producing horizons, however, made the data from the deeper test difficult to interpret. Temperature logging by the Geological Survey and Sandia National Laboratories to establish the equilibrium profile continued until August of 1987. The SSSDP provides a model for scientific cooperation among government agencies, universities, and private industry.","","","","","","United States","1988-01-01T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: Earthquakes and Volcanoes; (USA); Journal Volume: 20:4","","Medium: X; Size: Pages: 147-151","","","","Journal ID: ISSN 0894-7163; CODEN: EAVAE","","","2009-12-17T00:00:00Z","7202525","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/7202525","","Earthquakes and Volcanoes; (USA)","","20:4"

The main food source of these benthic organisms is supplied by symbiotic chemosynthetic activity of sulfur oxidizing bacteria. Biomarker lipids such as hydrocarbons, were analyzed to describe their sources and composition and also the relationships among microorganisms, biological communities, and dissolved and particulate organic materials in this productive area. The organic matter of vent waters is both quantitatively and qualitatively different from the non-vent bottom water. Dissolved hydrocarbon concentrations in warm water from fissures in basalts and hot clear water from smokers are 100 and 400 times more concentrated, respectively, than the water outside active areas. The biomarker compounds from hot clear water are characteristic of thermally mature organic matter as indicated by the 17..cap alpha..(H)->17..beta..(H)-hopane series, and the dominance of 5..cap alpha..(H),14..beta..(H),17..beta..(H)-steranes over the 5..cap alpha..(H),14..cap alpha..(H),17..cap alpha..(H),20R-steranes. The dissolved hydrocarbons from the warm waters may be correlated with bacterial lipid residues as indicated by the presence of isoprenoid hydrocarbons (pristane > phytane) and low molecular weight cyclic hydrocarbons. The water column samples collected near hydrothermally active areas contain bicyclic alkanes with drimane and rearranged drimane skeletons and mature biomarkers. The dissolved lipid matter is found to be degraded more rapidly by microbial activity and thermal processes, especially in the warm water effluent and in the water column around hydrothermal vents, than the lipids of the particulate matter.","","","Oregon State Univ., Corvallis (USA)","","","United States","1988-01-01T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: Org.

The proportions of various classes of compounds were examined and compared to those from other geographic areas (Peru upwelling region and Japan Trench) to gain insight into the relative importance of thermal generation, migration and biodegradation. Concentrations of C{sub 2}-C{sub 7} hydrocarbons were about 10-10,000 times higher in geothermally warm Guaymas Basin sediments in comparison to the low concentrations (0.1-10 ppb per compound) typical of geothermally cold sea floor and DSDP diatomaceous sediments. Alkene/alkane ratios of 0.1 or greater were typical of both geothermally cold sediments and also of very hydrocarbon-rich Alvin samples recovered from the sea floor. Because little or no alkene was generally detected in buried sediments exposed to geothermal temperatures greater than 30C, it is suggested that the alkenes are produced by biogenic processes. Normal alkanes predominated over cyclic and branched structures in geothermally cooler (<20{degree}C) sediments, with the proportion of cyclic and branched compounds increasing in hotter sediments. Similarities in compositions of branched and cyclic compounds were observed in some pairs of bitumen-rich Guaymas sea floor samples recovered from different areas, suggesting common mechanisms of light hydrocarbon generation and/or migration. 76 refs.","","","","","","United States","1988-01-01T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: Organic Geochemistry; (UK); Journal Volume: 12:2","","Medium: X; Size: Pages: 171-194","","","FG02-86ER13466","Journal ID: ISSN 0146-6380; CODEN: ORGED","10.1016/0146-6380(88)90253-7","","2016-05-06T00:00:00Z","7172577","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/7172577","","Organic Geochemistry; (UK)","","12:2"

The dominant quartz sand is hydrothermally cemented by chalcedony and is extremely hard, thereby justifying the term hydrothermal quartzite. The fundamental water type in Norris Basin is nearly neutral in pH and high in Cl and SiO/sub 2/. Another common type of water in Norris Basin is high in SO/sub 4/ and moderately high in Cl, with Cl/SO/sub 4/ ratios differing considerably.

An important part of this paper consists of examples of numerous changes in behavior and chemical composition of most springs and geysers, to extents not known elsewhere in the park and perhaps in the world. Hydrothermal mineralogy in core samples from three research holes drilled entirely in Lava Creek Tuff to a maximum depth of -331.6 m permits an interpretation of the hydrothermal alteration history.

The general derivative of chemical potential permits thermal variations which give rise to the thermoelectric effect. It also accounts for nonideal solution behavior. An equation describing electric field strength is similarly derived with the additional assumption of electrical neutrality in the fluid Planck approximation. The Planck approximation implies that self-potential (SP) is caused only by local sources and also that the electric field strength has only first order spatial variations. The derived relationships are applied to the NaCl-KCl concentration cell with predicted and measured voltages agreeing within 0.4 mV. The relationships are also applied to the Long Valley and Yellowstone geothermal systems. There is a high degree of correlation between predicted and measured SP response for both systems, giving supporting evidence for the validity of the approach. Predicted SP amplitude exceeds measured in both cases; this is a possible consequence of the Planck approximation. Electrochemical sources account for more than 90% of the predicted response in both cases while thermoelectric mechanisms account for the remaining 10%; electrokinetic effects are not considered. Predicted electrochemical and thermoelectric voltage coupling coefficients are comparable to values measured in the laboratory. The derived relationships are also applied to arbitrary distributions of temperature and fluid composition to investigate the geometric diversity of observed SP anomalies. Amplitudes predicted for hypothetical saline spring and hot spring environments are less than 40 mV. In contrast, hypothetical near surface steam zones generate very large amplitudes, over 2 V in one case. These results should be viewed with some caution due to the uncertain validity of the Planck approximation for these conditions. All amplitudes are controlled by electrochemical mechanisms. Polarities are controlled by the curvature of the concentration or thermal profile. Concave upward thermal profiles produce positive anomalies, for constant fluid concentrations, whereas concave upward concentration profiles produce negative anomalies. Concave downward concentration profiles are characterized by small negative closures bounding a larger, positive SP anomaly.","","","Lawrence Livermore National Lab.

Both temperature-dependent and temperature- and pressure-dependent viscosities are employed. For constant thermal expansion of coefficient we find the vigor of plume flows is diminished with larger magnitudes of the thermal expansivity. This effects is caused by the local domination of adiabatic decompression over viscous heating inside the developing plume for both the cartesian and axisymmetric domains. For deep mantle flows a thermal expansivity decreasing with depth is required for thin plume structures to exist. Values of the thermal expansivity contrast, which can promote plume growth, are in accord with estimates from recent studies in seismic equation of state. copyright American Geophysical Union 1987","","","Institute of Geology, Chinese Academy of Sciences, Beijing, P.R.

This component is ultimately derived from a mantle plume capped by a cooling batholith underlying the caldera. In surface hot springs, fumaroles, etc., the /sup 3/He//sup 4/He ratio varies from approx.1 to 16 tims the air ratio. The variations are produced by varying degrees of dilution of the magmatic component with radiogenic helium. The radiogenic helium is crustal-derived and is thought to be scavenged from aquifers in which the hydrothermal fluids circulate. We determined the helium iosotopic composition in 12 different springs from the Lower Geyser Basin, a large hydrothermal basin with the caldera. The /sup 3/He//sup 4/He ratio was found to vary from approx.2.7 to 7.7 times the air ratio. The variations correlate with variations in water chemistry. Specifically, the /sup 3/He//sup 4/He ratio increased with total bicarbonate concentration. The dissolved bicarbonate is from gas-water-rock interactions involving CO/sub 2/ and Na silicates. The concentration of bicarbonate is a function of the availability of dissolved CO/sub 2/, which, in turn, is a function of deep boiling with phase separation prior to CO/sub 2/-bicarbonate conversion. The correlation of high /sup 3/He//sup 4/He ratios with high bicarbonate is interpreted as the result of deep dilution of a single thermal fluid with cooler water during ascent to the surface. The dilution and cooling deters deep boiling, and therefore both CO/sub 2/ and /sup 3/He are retained in the rising fluid.

For a number of sites the heat flow values given in the Initial Reports of the Deep Sea Drilling Project have been revised; less than half of the boreholes in which thermal measurements were attempted gave reliable data. By the end of the Deep Sea Drilling Project (DSDP) in 1983, reliable borehole heat flow measurements had been obtained at some 80 sites in all of the world oceans except the Arctic. The reliable values are considered to represent the deeper heat flux to within 20%; for a few the accuracy is within 5%. Most temperature measurements have been obtained using probes penetrating the undisturbed sediments at the bottom of the hole at subbottom depths of between 75 m and 250 m, although some data have been obtained at depths less than 30 and over 1000 m.

Chimney sulfides range from 1.6 to 5.7%. The chimneys consist of Fe-sphalerite zoned to inner zinc sulfide and chalcopyrite ( +- isocubanite)-pyrrhotite lining channels. Sulfide from inner walls of type A chimneys have the lightest delta/sup 34/S values. Type B chimneys (porous, unzoned, low-Fe-sphalerite) have the isotopically heaviest chimney sulfides and occur at vent sites distal to the along-axis shallow point of the ridge crest, hence distal to the magma chamber. These variations are largely ascribed to sulfate reduction by ferrous iron in the hydrothermal fluid in chimneys of substrate mounds, probably due to transitory entrainment of ambient sulfate-bearing seawater. The delta/sup 18/O values of end-member hydrothermal fluids range from 0.6 to 0.8%, significantly lower than the delta/sup 18/O values at 21 /sup 0/N vent fluids. The deltaD values of the fluid samples range from -2.5 to 0.5%. Isotopic differences from the 21 /sup 0/N fluids may be due to slightly higher water/rock ratios, approximately 1.0, in the southern Juan de Fuca Ridge hydrothermal system.

The plumes consist of two layers: a shallow plume (about 200 m above the summit) and a deep plume (about 100 m above the summit), probably derived from different hydrothermal vents. The shallow and deep plumes showed different CH{sub 4}/{sup 3}He and CH{sub 4}/pH ratios with the same {sup 3}He/pH ratio, which implies that methane concentrations differ between the hydrothermal end members for the two plumes. The variation of methane between the end members is suggested to result from inter-vent inhomogeneity of bacterial activities that consume or produce methane within the vents. Comparison of the CH{sub 4}/{sup 3}He ratios of the two plumes with the previous data for Loihi and other submarine hydrothermal areas confirms that the Loihi hotspot has one to two orders of magnitude smaller CH{sub 4}/{sup 3}He value than those of the East Pacific Rise and the Galapagos spreading centers.","","","","","","United States","1987-10-01T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: Geochimica et Cosmochimica Acta; (USA); Journal Volume: 51:10","","Medium: X; Size: Pages: 2857-2864","","","","Journal ID: ISSN 0016-7037; CODEN: GCACA","10.1016/0016-7037(87)90163-3","","2016-05-09T00:00:00Z","7259201","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/7259201","","Geochimica et Cosmochimica Acta; (USA)","","51:10"

Upon adding recent rainfall an additional minimum of pressure in such a reservoir is seen to have occurred in 1983--85. With the deduced 8-year response, a natural decline in the srping flow would thus be expected in 1991--93.

Calculation of a temperature based Rayleigh number, Ra/sub T/, is complicated by the thermal coupling that exists between an intrusion and its host. However, the typically greater thermal resistance of the host regime compared to that of convecting magma can allow the host to control heat flux from a magma chamber in a manner somewhat independent of the state of convection in the chamber. In a system where heat flux is controlled rather than temperature, a heat flux based Rayleigh number, Ra/sub F/, is a more natural parameter to employ, although it has not been used in most magmatic convection models. While the insulating properties of the host regime tend to reduce the value of the thermal Rayleigh number, whether temperature or flux based, this value can be very large compared to any critical value of the Rayleigh number that might exist. The quantity Ra/sub F/ is used to obtain useful relationships for estimating the thermal and kinematic regime in magma. Conservative models of a cooling lava lake, which include temperature dependent viscosity, show that convection will be vigorous enough to circulate phenocrysts. However, the time dependent nature of magmatic convection and the tendency of whole body convection to vanish before crystallization is complete severely complicate any attempt to infer convective amplitudes from the observed distribution of crystals ''frozen'' into the interior of the body. copyright American Geophysical Union 1987","","","Geophysics Research Division, Sandia National Laboratories, Albuquerque","","","United States","1987-09-01T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: Geophys.

The top of this magma body contained little chemical variations, the lowest concentration of light REEs, and the highest concentrations of SiO/sub 2/, heavy REEs, and Th. The pumice fragments derived from the top of the magma body contain nearly pure ferrohedenbergite and fayalite. The next discrete zone in the magma body contained lower SiO/sub 2/, heavy REEs, and Th concentrations, and very high concentrations of light REEs. The lowest erupted layer contained relatively low concentrations of SiO/sub 2/, Th, and light and heavy REEs. Pumice fragments with polymodal disequilibrium phenocryst populations are a priori evidence of magma mixing. The magma mixing process is constrained by: the systematic vertical distribution of chemically distinct pumice fragments throughout the ash-flow sheet; the presence of disequilibrium phenocrysts within some pumice fragments in all but the lowermost part of the sheet; and the presence of compositionally uniform glass in most pumice fragments, including those with widely varying phenocryst compositions. Negligible mixing occurred at the top of the magma body; limited mixing occurred in the second and third layers. Because mixing did not destroy the original layering, the amount of guest magma must have been small. In order for unzoned disequilibrium phenocrysts to not become zoned, they must have been preserved in the magma body only a short time. And yet, in order to produce the homogeneous liquid that surrounds these phenocrysts, mechanical mixing must have been very efficient. 44 references.","","","Michigan State Univ., East Lansing","","","United States","1987-09-01T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: J.

These fields are characteristic of high-temperature hydrothermal systems in regions of current volcanism, the natural results being sulfur-ammonium boiling springs and fumaroles. Drilling has shown such hydrothermal systems to be vapor-dominated at depth. Drilling at the Mutnov field has allowed examination of the section down to a depth of approx. 1.5 km. The results are important for understanding underlying processes, particularly because very few vapor-dominated systems have been studied. This paper proposes a genetic model for the Mutnov geothermal area in Kamchatka.

We present a statistical method for identifying fault of joint planes within what may otherwise appear to be an amorphous earthquake location set. The method takes all the hypocenters in an event set three at a time in order to determine the strikes and dips of all possible planes within the event set. A procedure for correcting for the shape of the region in which the earthquakes occur is applied. After correction, the orientation (one or a few) that is seen most often is taken as that of the zone of preexisting fault(s) of joint(s). We applied the method to a set of hypocenters determined for microearthquakes that accompanied a hydraulic injection into crystalline rock. The method was able to resolve successively five statistically significant orientations (planes) along which most of the microearthquakes occurred. The first two planes determined by the method are parallel to one nodal plane from each of the two most commonly found fault plane solutions. One of the two planes intersects the injection well bore at a location where water is known to have entered the rock during the injection. The planes identified thus coincide with the major fluid paths during the hydraulic injection. copyright American Geophysical Union 1987","","","Los Alamos National Laboratory, Los Alamos, New Mexico","","","United States","1987-08-10T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: J.

Seismograms recorded in the treatment well bore are composed of interacting phases which to data defay discrete identification and preclude standard inversion techniques to determine source characteristics, propagation path characteristics, or both. To understand the recorded data, synthetic seismograms have been generated using treatement-induced, low-velocity zone (LVZ). The LVZ is produced by pore dilatancy in response to formation fluid pressurization caused by pressure diffusion from the treatment fluid and fracture opening. Borehole, seismometer coupling, fluid transport, and dynamic fracture effects are not considered. The models examined showed that a fixed-aperture fracture plus surrounding LVZ acted as a leaky waveguide confining the seismic energy and altering propagation characteristics which resulted in unconventional seismograms. The seismograms were composed of multiple transient phases caused by phase interactions and conversions at the waveguide boudaries and stationary phases corresponding to the eigenfrequency structure of the fracture-LVZ waveguide. copyright American Geophysical Union 1987","","","Department of Geophysical Research, Teledyne Geotech, Garland, Texas","","","United States","1987-08-10T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: J.

The analysis utilizes the cotinuous distribution of instantaneous ring sources of fluid over the well bore surface in order to reduce the problem to a set of singular integral equations for a homogeneous and isotropic porous medium. When the ratio of the test interval length to well bore diameter is small, or the specific storage is small, the flow parallel to the well bore axis becomes significant, and the shape of the type curves obtained from the present analysis is different from that of the conventional type curves. Use of the conventional type curves should be restricted to intervals that are more than 20 times longer than the well bore diameter.

The model is of a well producing at a constant bottomhole pressure (BHP) from a two-phase fractured reservoir. The recoverable fluid reserves are shown to depend strongly on the amount of CO/sub 2/ present in the reservoir system. The results obtained revealed a complex fracture/matrix interaction caused by the thermodynamics of H/sub 2/O/CO/sub 2/ mixtures. Although the matrix initially contributes fluids (liquid and gas) to the fractures, the flow directions later reverse and the fractures backflow fluids into the matrix. The amount of backflow depends primarily on the flowing gas saturation in the fractures; the lower the flowing gas saturation in the fractures, the more backflow. An analytic expression has been derived that allows for the determination of mass backflow on the basis of wellhead measurements of noncondensible gases and flowing enthalpy.","","","Lawrence Berkeley Lab.","","","United States","1987-08-01T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: SPE (Society of Petroleum Engineers) Reserv.

This mineralization is hosted by fractured, quartz-sericitized, intracaldera ash-flow tuffs younger than 1.12 Ma. The molybdenite is an unusual, poorly crystalline variety that occurs in vuggy veinlets and breccia cements also containing quartz, sericite (illite), pyrite, and fluorite, as well as local sphalerite, rhodochrosite, and chalcopyrite. Fluid-inclusion data suggest that this assemblage was deposited from very dilute solutions at temperatures near 200/sup 0/C. Geochemical modeling indicates that under restricted pH and fO/sub 2/ conditions at 200/sup 0/C, the molybdenite and associated phases would be in equilibrium with hydrothermal fluids now circulating in the deep subsurface.

The processes controlling dispersion in fracture systems that are explicitly simulated by the numerical model are (1) development of a velocity profile within individual fractures, (2) transverse molecular diffusion between streamlines, both within fractures and at fracture junctions, and (3) advection with the bulk fluid through a system of fractures with a range of hydraulic gradients and apertures. The first two processes, referred to as microdispersion, are often assumed to be secondary to the third, referred to as macrodispersion. The validity of this assumption is, however, highly dependent on the hydrodynamics of the system under consideration. Data collected from a physical model of a fracture network are used to validate a numerical model that explicitly simulates all three transport processes. The numerical model is then used to evaluate the relevance of microdispersion processes in a system where macrodispersion is significant.","","","Idaho National Engineering Lab., Idaho Falls (USA)","","","United States","1987-08-01T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: Water Resour.

For the first time in New Zealand's history, private companies may compete with governmental agencies to develop the country's geothermal resources. The governmental agencies will compete among themselves, as well, and be expected to make a profit. The two changes affect each other in a manner that benefits the environment. This occurs because a developer must secure both land rights and water rights before undertaking a geothermal project. As geothermal water is under New Zealand ground water law, local water boards issue the water rights for geothermal projects. These local boards must choose among all geothermal project applications, both public and private. Such competition is presently underway for the rights to develop Mokai Geothermal field, the hottest and most promising new field in the country.

The tool can help exploration engineers recover more energy from geothermal, oil, and gas reservoirs by locating deeply buried rock fractures. A prototype of the tool, built by Southwest Research Institute of San Antonio, Texas, has been successfully demonstrated at a special granite quarry test facility south of Albuquerque, New Mexico. During field tests, the tool has detected simulated fractures that were more than 30 feet away from a test borehole. No other mapping tool has this directional capability. The tool, which fits in a typical uncased borehole, emits pulses, each of which lasts just eight billionths of a second. The frequency spectrum of the pulses ranges up to the VHF band. Fracture direction is determined by transmitting powerful, highly directional radar pulses in a known direction from a borehole. Discontinuities in the rock will interrupt and reflect radar signals; therefore, signals that return to the tool's receiving antenna indicate the presence of fractures. The return signal's time delay translates into distances from the borehole. The transmitter and receiver rotate in place, permitting the tool to scan for fractures in all directions from the borehole.","","","","","","United States","1987-07-01T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: Geotherm.

Trexler and his coworkers have been exploring whether heating gold and silver leaching solutions with geothermal energy can speed up and increase recoveries of gold and silver, and allow heap-leach projects to operate even in freezing weather. In his report, Trexler identified 10 operating mines near existing geothermal sites in Nevada which, as such, are likely candidates for geothermal enhancement of leaching operations.

The project will combine vocational training, geothermal heat-transfer research, and commercial resources for greenhouse heating, crop drying, and other agricultural operations. The first phase of the project involved drilling wells to confirm the availability of an adequate geothermal resource. The first well, AG Park 1, drilled in January, 1986 to a depth of 1614 feet, proved noncommercial; it will be used as an injection well. Next, a geophysical program of seismic surveys was undertaken to pinpoint the more productive fracture zones. Wells AG Park 2 and 3 were drilled in these zones. Both wells were drilled in December 1986, to depths of 592 and 488 feet, respectively. In 3-day tests of continuous production, AG Park 2 and 3 yielded flowing wellhead temperatures of 143/sup 0/F and 153/sup 0/F, respectively, at flow rates exceeding 150 gpm, with minor drawdowns. The next phase of the project entails construction of a 7000 square-foot greenhouse by the end of 1987. It will be operated by the Mendocino-Lake Community College District as an educational and demonstration facility. Geothermal-fluid and irrigation water-distribution and injection-pipeline systems will also be installed in preparation for future commercial leasing on the 3-acre site. The demonstration greenhouse will allow evaluation of the effectiveness of various heat-transfer systems. This would assist commercial operators in designing the most economical system for their needs.","","","","","","United States","1987-07-01T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: Geotherm.

When completed, the Kakkonda-Shizukuishi plant will produce 100 megawatts of electrical power and supply roughly 4500 gal./min. (gpm) of hot water to private homes, industries, public facilities, and other users. Currently, one 50-megawatt power unit is in operation at the plant; wells are being drilled for a duplicate second unit; the hot-water production plant is nearing completion; and the piping system to distribute the hot water is under construction. The geothermal energy that powers the Kakkonda-Shizukuishi plant originates in the liquid-dominated reservoir beneath the spectacular Takinoue hot springs area. Fluid temperature in the reservoir is about 240/sup 0/C (465/sup 0/F). The power plant is a single-flash plant, rated at 50 megawatts. It began operating in 1978 with 11 production and 16 injection wells. The heat-exchange facility is about 1.2 miles southeast of the power plant. Fresh water is taken from the Kakkonda River at a point roughly 0.6 mile upstream of the power plant. One-third of the 13,500 gpm of waste brine will be diverted to the heat-exchange facility, where it will be used in a five-stage, flash-evaporation process to heat the fresh water from 15 to 118/sup 0/C. The facility will produce 3600 gpm of fresh hot water, 1350 gpm of which will be used in a variety of processes in an industrial park. The rest of the hot water will be blended with 100 gpm of cold water. The resulting water, at 85/sup 0/C, will be distributed to the community for various uses. 11 references.","","","Southeastern Massachusetts Univ., North Dartmouth, MA (USA)","","","United States","1987-07-01T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: Geotherm.

The experiment was performed to assess the effect of organic matter reactivity on solution speciation and sediment alteration processes at an elevated temperature and pressure, and provide requisite data to better understand the chemistry of hydrothermal fluids issuing from vents in the Guaymas Basin, Gulf of California. Sea water chemistry changed greatly during the experiment. Moreover, owing to the thermal alteration of sediment organic matter, organic acids, phenolic derivatives and phthlate were released to solution. Examination of solid alteration products revealed the effects of extensive dissolution and precipitation processes characterized by total elimination of diatoms and formation of cristobalite, quartz, pyrite, pyrrhotite, mixed layer chlorite/smectite, and calcite. A graphitic residue was also present in the products of the experiment. Mg and Na fixation reactions during the experiment generated significant H/sup +/, although the pH measured at 25/sup 0/C was approximately 6.2. Speciation calculations including ammine and acetate protonation reactions give a pH at experimental conditions of approximately 5.1, while mineral solubility relations involving virtually all alteration phases require a pH of 5.57 to 5.94.

The other developer in Hawaii is True/Mid-Pacific Geothermal Venture. Principals of both True Geothermal and Mid-Pacific Geothermal are from Wyoming. This group has run into local opposition since late 1981. Originally, they planned to construct a 250 megawatt project in the upper end of the Kilauea East Rift Zone (KERZ) on the Island of Hawaii, near the Volcanoes National Park. Then, they changed to a 100 megawatt project in the middle of the KERZ. The EIS has been accepted and the group has received the necessary, state land-use permit. However, the permit action was appealed by a few Pele practitioners. In July 1987, the Hawaii Supreme Court ruled unanimously in favor of the development project. In August 1987, Governor John Waihee established a blue-ribbon panel to study the feasibility of developing an inter-island cable system to transmit 500 megawatts of geothermally-produced electricity from the KERZ on the Island of Hawaii to the Islands of Maui and Oahu, where 80% of the state's population live. This system has a price tag of $475 million (1986). It will span a greater length of ocean and lie in deeper ocean depths than any other high-voltage submarine cable.

The high-temperature reservoir (HTR) is defined by flowing fluid temperatures exceeding 500/sup 0/F, rock temperatures apparently exceeding 600/sup 0/F, and steam enthalpies of about 1320 Btu/lb. The HTR in the northwest Geysers is probably a deep, evolving system in contrast to the shallower, leaky, and mature steam reservoir(s) in the central and southeastern portions of the field. Before natural venting and nearby production caused pressures to decline, the HTR was a liquid-dominated system with some connate water - the connate water being the source of the high gas contents, chloride, and unique isotopic composition relative to steam from a typical Geysers reservoir. Therefore, the present boundary between the typical reservoir and HTR is a transient, thermodynamic condition due to the recent evolution of a vapor-dominated zone from a liquid-dominated zone that has yet to cool down. It also demarks a previous liquid-to-vapor interface. Pressure in the two reservoirs is essentially the same because they are in communication with each other. In other words, the temperature change in the HTR is lagging (behind) the pressure change.","","","","","","United States","1987-06-01T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: Geotherm.

In the 1970's, state and federal governments took an active interest in geothermal energy in New Mexico. The studies identified 21 low-temperature sites in the state with the highest potential for commercial development. In 1980, the state initiated the Geothermal Commercialization Program. The program's goal is to promote the use of geothermal energy for economic development. The primary target is the sector of the commercial greenhouse industry growing high-value horticultural and floricultural crops. New Mexico State University (NMSU) has become the center of the state's geothermal research program. The NMSU Geothermal Greenhouse Facility, constructed and operated by the New Mexico Solar Energy Institute, is a 12,000-square-foot, geothermally-heated greenhouse that provides a testing facility for commercial growers considering southern New Mexico for their operations. By 1985, the state's geothermal greenhouse industry covered 13 acres. Since the NMSU greenhouses were constructed in 1986, two large greenhouse companies have taken advantage of the facilities. Flores de New Mexico, of Las Cruces, and Masson Southwest, Inc. of Linwood, Kansas, used the facilities for pilot studies of the area. Both have stayed in the area and have expanded. Flores de New Mexico built 10 acres of greenhouses on the NMSU campus and is planning a five-acre expansion, and Masson, Inc. is building a four-acre greenhouse in Radium Springs, NM. Geothermal technology is also being used by three greenhouse businesses in Hidalgo County's Animas Valley, south of Lordsburg. Beall Company of New Mexico, Inc., Burgett Floral, Inc., and McCant's Greenhouse are tapping into the large thermal reservoir in the southwestern corner of the state.","","","","","","United States","1987-06-01T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: Geotherm.

Low-permeability zones of the crystalline basement contain coarse-grained relict muscovite, whereas rock alteration near fracture zones at temperatures > 150/sup 0/C is characterized by abundant fine-grained sericite in association with secondary calcite and quartz and unaltered relict microcline. In this hydrothermal sericite there is an increase in interlayer K, octahedral Mg + Fe/sub total/ and tetrahedral Al with increasing temperature between approx. 215/sup 0/ to >250/sup 0/C. Thermodynamic activity of the Al/sub 2/Si/sub 4/O/sub 10/(OH)/sub 2/ component of sericites, calculated using site-mixing approximations of HELGESON and AAGAARD (1985), decreases with increasing temperature between approx. 215/sup 0/ and >250/sup 0/C. Although the compositions of hydrothermal sericites are a complex function of temperature, pressure and geothermal fluid composition, compositional relations observed at Coso together with published compositions of hydrothermal dioctahedral layer-silicates from the Salton Sea geothermal system demonstrates that elemental compositions of interlayer K and tetrahedral Al increase systematically with increasing temperature despite the dramatic differences in fluid compositions between these two geothermal systems. This suggests that the observed variations in interlayer and tetrahedral site occupancy is largely dependent on the enthalpy of hydrolysis reactions representing equilibrium between sericite solid solutions and the geothermal reservoir fluids.","","","Stanford Univ., CA (USA)","","","United States","1987-05-01T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: Geochim.

Geochemical processes related to hydrothermal activity occurring at the boundary between different media are of special interest. About 10 years ago, concentrations of suspended iron 20 times greater than those in the overlying waters were found in the bottom waters of the Mid-Atlantic Rift near 26/sup 0/N. A number of reports then appeared, showing that in other rift zones as well, the bottom/water interface is characterized by elevated concentrations of iron, manganese, zinc, copper, nickel, and other elements. Thus the present writers were persuaded that the minor elements in bottom waters can serve as indicators of hydrothermal flux to the ocean floor. In carrying out investigations of this kind, one must study the distribution of the metals not only in the bottom waters, but through the entire depth of the sea, so that anomalies can be detected and localized against the level of the background concentrations. In addition, to obtain information on the sources of the metals, one must determine not just the total contents, but also distinguish the metals in solution and in suspension. Results are discussed. The observations clarify the relations between dissolved and suspended forms of metals in weakly mineralized waters above oceanic rifts. 13 references, 5 figures, 5 tables.","","","Institute of Oceanology, Moscow, USSR","","","United States","1987-04-01T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: Int.

Mineralizing brines are also indicated by the current ore-forming hydrothermal systems in Cheleken, Salton Sea, and the Red Sea. A single genetic scheme cannot be applied to the extensive areas of stratiform mineralization associated with hot mineralizing brines rising along faults. There is also no agreed view on the source of the ore material or on the potential for the formation of mineralizing solutions by reaction with rocks containing normal levels of metals. The origin of the mineralizing brines themselves is debatable. Here an attempt is made to answer some of these questions from studies on pore brines and the host clastic beds beneath or between salt beds. From studies in several East European regions, the author develops a model in which deep migrating brines from evaporite basins extract metals from clastic rocks and precipitate them where they encounter sulfur-bearing fluids. 32 references, 4 figures, 4 tables.","","","Lomonosov Univ. of Moscow, USSR","","","United States","1987-04-01T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: Int.

During and after reinjection, strong short-term variations of the isotopic composition of the steam were observed near the reinjection area. These variations were due mainly to mixing between the reinjected and deep components. Large isotopic fractionations occur at depth during the evaporation of the reinjected water, and may affect the evaluation of the recovered fluid using a simple mixing model. Stable isotope and gas/steam ratios are closely correlated in the fluid collected in the monitored wells, in agreement with the hypothesis that an effective mixing process occurs at depth, accompanied by the formation of a liquid plume subjected to different degrees of evaporation. The non-linear correlation between isotope and gas/steam ratios has been interpreted with a model where the deep and chemical differences in the original fluids are modified by reinjection.","","","Istituto Internazionale per le Richerche Geotermiche, Pisa (Italy)","","","United States","1987-04-01T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: Geochim.

At 298 K and 1 bar there is a minimum in ..delta..H (-2.39 kcal/mole at X/sub w//sup m/ approx. = 0.27). Results of high-pressure drop calorimetry on hydrous albite melts show that ..delta..H becomes more endothermic as T increases.

Mildly altered samples show (1) similar but less extreme enrichments and depletion compared to highly altered samples, and (2) no megascopic evidence of alteration. Cs is the most sensitive of the elements enriched by the alteration, followed by Rb and K/sub 2/O. Greater tendency toward fixation of heavy alkalis at low temperatures accompanying the addition of K-feldspar and the reduction of andesine explains relative alteration trends. The lack of proximal mineralization and widespread nature of alkali metasomatism associated with minor propylitic alteration suggests fossil geothermal activity in this part of Utah.","","","College of Charleston, SC","","","United States","1987-01-01T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: Mt.

A bench-scale technique which makes use of adsorptive bubble flotation is employed to remove silica after flocculation by the addition of polyvalent metal ions to hot (60-90/sup 0/C) spent brine discharge. Ferric and aluminum salts are evaluated as flocculants under varying conditions. The anionic surfactant sodium lauryl sulfate and the cationic surfactant lauryl amine hydrochloride (LA) are utilized as the collectors below and above the isoelectric point, respectively. Efficiency of removal of the silica is pH, metal concentration, and surfactant-type dependent. Best results are achieved under slightly alkaline conditions (pH = 8), using 3.75 x 10E/sup -4/ M ferric ion present as its sulfate, La as the collector, and with a gas flow of 15 +/- 3 mL/min. Under these conditions, approximately 70 +/- 2% of the total silica is separated from the brine discharge; this value, although not quantitative, represents more than 85% removal of the silica present above its amorphous solubility at the operating temperature. After the separation process, fluids contain residual concentrations of silica which are not expected to result in scale deposition and which can then be passed through heat exchangers to extract further energy for secondary uses.","","","Univ. of Hawaii, Honolulu","","","United States","1987-01-01T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: Sep.

Below 460 m of volcanics, where the newly formed minerals were mainly chlorite, calcite and zeolites (mostly phillipsite), drilling entered the Allochthonous Flysch Complex. Evidence of the ''Cicerchina facies'' was found down to 1600 m depth. Starting from 1070 m, down to hole bottom, a contact metasomatic complex was defined by the appearance of garnet. Garnet together with K-fledspar, vesuvianite, wilkeite, cuspidine, harkerite, wollastonite and apatite prevail in the top part of the contact metasomatic complex. Vesuvianite and phlogopite characterize the middle part. Phlogopite, pyroxene, spinel and cancrinite predominate in the bottom part. The 1500 m thick metasomatic complex indicates the presence at depth of the intrusion of a trachytic magma which released hot fluids involved in metasomatic mineral-forming reactions. Minerals such as harkerite, wilkeite, cuspidine, cancrinite, vesuvianite and phlogopite indicate the intrusive melt had a high volatile content which is in agreement with the very high explosivity index of this volcanic district. The system is at present sealed by abundant calcite and anhydrite. It is proposed that most, if not all, of the sulphates formed after reaction of SO/sub 2/ with aqueous calcium species rather than from sulphates being remobilized from evaporitic (Triassic) rocks as previously inferred. The hypothesis of a CO/sub 2/-rich deep-derived fluid ascending through major fracture systems and contrasting cooling in the hottest areas of Latium is presented.","","","Centro di Studio per la Geologia dell'Italia Centrale del C.N.R. c/o Dipartimento di Scienze della Terra, Universita degli Studi di Roma ''La Sapienza'' I-00185 Roma","","","United States","1987-01-01T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: Geothermics; (United States); Journal Volume: 16:2","","Medium: X; Size: Pages: 127-146","","","","Journal ID: CODEN: GTMCA","10.1016/0375-6505(87)90061-7","","2016-04-29T00:00:00Z","5914426","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/5914426","","Geothermics; (United States)","","16:2"

The average heat flow through the sediments is found to be 71 mWm/sup -2/ +- 12mWm/sup -2/ which is about 30 mWm/sup -2/ higher than in the neighbouring shield area of the Churchill province, and the contribution from heat generation in the sediments to the surface heat flow is only approximately 2.5 mWm/sup -2/. The relationship between basement heat generation and heat flow is investigated, and it is found that the platform heat flow/heat generation values are in general higher than those from the Churchill province of the shield found by Drury (1985). Although for the platform and shield data, the reduced heat flow is about 40 mWm/sup -2/ and the slope is about 8km, it is apparent that the platform data alone are not good enough to establish a precise relationship.","","","Dept. of Physics, Univ. of Alberta, Edmonton, Alberta T6G 2J1","","","United States","1987-01-01T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: Geothermics; (United States); Journal Volume: 16:1","","Medium: X; Size: Pages: 1-16","","","","Journal ID: CODEN: GTMCA","10.1016/0375-6505(87)90075-7","","2016-05-16T00:00:00Z","6060787","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/6060787","","Geothermics; (United States)","","16:1"

X-ray powder diffraction, electron microprobe analyses and classical optical methods were used to identify these hydrothermal minerals. Sulfates (gypsum, alunite, alunogen, halotrichite, etc.), carbonates (calcite, trona, thermonatrite, etc.), clay minerals (kaolinite, illite-smectite mixed layer mineral, etc.) and silica minerals (opal, chalcedony, etc.) are the dominant phases. Native sulfur, pyrite, marcasite and aragonite are next in order of abundance. Some chabazite, analcime, pitchblende, coffinite, hematite, thenardite, rozenite, coquimbite, manganocalcite and rhodochrosite is also present. Although travertine and efflorescences, along with carbonates and simple sulfates, are widespread in the low-temperature hydrothermal areas, siliceous sinters and hydrothermal altered minerals, such as clay minerals, zeolites and efflorescences with complex sulfates containing Fe, Al, are only found in a few high-temperature hydrothermal areas, such as in the Hot Sea and the Ruidian hydrothermal areas. Most of the wall rock was intensely altered by geothermal fluid in the Hot Sea and Ruidian, zoning in the characteristic feature of the altered minerals within the Hot Sea.

G.E.V.A. uses this method to allow users to realistically estimate the range of costs to be expected in geothermal electricity development. Such risk analysis offers a number of distinct advantages over the conventional single estimate approach: (1) Risk is made explicit: the uncertainty perceived in the resource estimates are incorporated directly into the cost analysis. Knowledge of both the most likely outcome as well as the range of possibilities helps to create a more rational and informed decision-making process. (2) Variability of outcome is measured: the dispersion in the possible outcome is estimated. Other things being equal, lower variability in the estimated cost of power is desirable. (3) Promotes better decisions: the simulation approach requires more judgment in estimating the values for the uncertain elements in the investment. Recognizing what is known and not known with regard the resource, leads to a more careful analysis. The most likely value for each uncertain parameter along with the range of possible values are input. Results are given in terms of the levelized cost in mills/kWh for which the geothermal electricity can be produced. A mean value is computed along with range of possibilities and their relative chance. Solution for a two hundred sample run takes only about twenty minutes on an IBM personal computer. Use of a fast structured code, such as C-language, using the 8087 match co-processor could reduce the runtime by an order of magnitude. G.E.V.A. is a useful tool for geothermal assessment. It provides improved insight into the economics of high temperature geothermal resources for investment decisions.","","","Precision Energy, P.O.

Diffusivity ranges between approximately 0.6 and 1.9 mm/sup 2//s, the lower end of the range being appropriate for basic rocks and the upper end for quartz-bearing acidic rocks. The scatter in diffusivity for each data set is significantly more than that of thermal conductivity, because the diffusivity of water is typically less than 10% of the diffusivity of most common minerals, whereas water conductivity is 25 - 30% of the conductivity of the minerals. For a sample set of uniform mineralogy in which porosity varies, a greater variation of diffusivity than of conductivity is therefore expected. For three of the sets sufficient mineralogical data were available to permit the assessment of methods of estimating thermal diffusivity from mineral content. All models tested yielded higher mean values of diffusivity than the means of the measured values. No model was found to be able to predict diffusivity to better than approximately 20%, but if that accuracy is sufficient, a simple geometrical model, for which only quartz content must be known, is adequate. The diffusivity data have been combined with measurements of thermal conductivity and density to provide estimates of specific heat. These all tend to be higher than those reported in the literature. For some rocks, such as the basalts, this can be explained in terms of relatively high water content and the very high specific heat of water compared with that of most common minerals. For the granites and granodiorites, the new specific heat data redefine the previously published means and ranges, by increasing the data base by approximately an order of magnitude.","","","Lithosphere and Canadian Shield Div., Geological Survey of Canada, 1 Observatory Crescent, Ottawa, Ontario K1A 0Y3","","","United States","1987-01-01T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: Geothermics; (United States); Journal Volume: 16:2","","Medium: X; Size: Pages: 105-116","","","","Journal ID: CODEN: GTMCA","10.1016/0375-6505(87)90059-9","","2016-05-09T00:00:00Z","6103366","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/6103366","","Geothermics; (United States)","","16:2"

Common hydrothermal alteration minerals are chalcedony, cryptocrystalline silica, stilbite, cristobalite, montmorillonite and pyrite with traces of clinoptilolite and platy calcite. This mineral assemblage is in equilibrium in a temperature range of 100/sup 0/C +- 10/sup 0/C, which is actually recorded in boreholes. A conductive temperature gradient of 100 +- 20/sup 0/C/km is measured in 300-350 m deep boreholes drilled in an area of 4 x 0.5 km. The average heat flow is computed to be around 290 +- 50 mW/m/sup 2/. Maximum possible heat generation due to radioactive decay around Tattapani could be in the region of 75 +- 15 mW/m/sup 2/. Saturated hot water (105-108/sup 0/C) under pressure was encountered in two boreholed, and a 5000-6000 1/min flow was more or less maintained for about 6 months in one of these holes which is being deepened after controlling the blow-out. A model is proposed for such an anomalous geothermal regime which cannot be explained by the contemporary understanding of the known magmatic history of the Indian shield.","","","Geothermal Div., Geological Survey of India, 46 Avinash, Ramdaspeth, Nagpur 440010","","","United States","1987-01-01T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: Geothermics; (United States); Journal Volume: 16:1","","Medium: X; Size: Pages: 61-76","","","","Journal ID: CODEN: GTMCA","10.1016/0375-6505(87)90079-4","","2016-05-16T00:00:00Z","6100082","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/6100082","","Geothermics; (United States)","","16:1"

The fluid produced by the two geothermal systems is a high rhoCO/sub 2/(around 7 MPa) sodium chloride solution (T.D.S. is 9200 ppm at Latera and 7800 at Torre Alfina), with high SiO/sub 2/ and H/sub 3/BO/sub 3/ contents. The fluid temperature taken at well bottom is about 155/sup 0/C at Torre Alfina, whereas at Latera it ranges from 200 to over 350/sup 0/C. In spite of these temperatures, recorded in producing wells, previous geochemical prospectings using geothermometers in natural thermal manifestations had predicted temperatures no higher than 140/sup 0/C in all the Vulsini district. This contrasting feature between real temperatures and those evaluated during prospecting is caused by the fast circulation of large amounts of meteoric waters in the aquifer located in the shallow parts of the carbonate reservoir formations, and by the short interaction between the latter and the deep geothermal fluids. In the present study a new geochemical survey on thermal and cold springs, stream samples, as well as natural gas emissions has been carried out. A critical review of the main geothermometers, some considerations about the hydraulic behavior of the reservoir formations, and the cross comparison between NH/sub 4//sup +//B ratio, rhoCO/sub 2/ and SiO/sub 2/ content in both cold and thermal waters, have led to the conclusion that in the Vulsini Mts there are no shallow anomalous areas apart from those already discovered at Latera and Torre Alfina. The present method could be successfully applied in other geothermal systems, where the potential reservoir is represented by carbonate formations.","","","Dipartimento di Scienze della Terra dell' Universita', Via La Pira 4, 50121 Florence","","","United States","1987-01-01T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: Geothermics; (United States); Journal Volume: 16:2","","Medium: X; Size: Pages: 147-158","","","","Journal ID: CODEN: GTMCA","10.1016/0375-6505(87)90062-9","","2016-05-23T00:00:00Z","5936966","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/5936966","","Geothermics; (United States)","","16:2"

These data complete the surficial coverage of the thermal anomaly, revealing the shape and lateral extent of the hydrothermal system. The thermal data show the region of high thermal gradients to extend only a short distance offshore to the north of the Quaternary volcanic domes which are exposed along the southern shore of the Salton Sea. The thermal anomaly has an arcuate shape, about 4 km wide and 12 km long. Across the center of the anomaly, the transition zone between locations exhibiting high thermal gradients and those exhibiting regional thermal gradients is quite narrow. Thermal gradients rise from near regional (0.09 C/m) to extreme (0.83 C/m) in only 2.4 km. The heat flow in the central part of the anomaly is &gt;600 mW/m{sup 2} and in some areas exceeds 1200 mW/m{sup 2}. The shape of the thermal anomaly is asymmetric with respect to the line of volcanoes previously thought to represent the center of the field, with its center line offset south of the volcanic buttes. There is no broad thermal anomaly associated with the magnetic high that extends offshore to the northeast from the volcanic domes. These observations of the thermal anomaly provide important constraints for models of the circulation of the hydrothermal system. Thermal budgets based on a simple model for this hydrothermal system indicate that the heat influx rate for local ''hot spots'' in the region may be large enough to account for the rate of heat flux from the entire Salton Trough.","","","Lawrence Livermore National Lab.

The borehole gravimetric densities matched the well logs, but the surface gradient was found to be 0.0040 mgal/m higher than expected. When the borehole observations are corrected for the observed free air gradient above ground, they produce densities which are nearly uniformly higher than log densities by about 0.07 gm/cm{sup 3}. These measurements require densities in the depth range .5 to 3 km, for a radius of a few kilometers around State 2-14 to be as dense as those found in State 2-14.

The purpose of the study was to identify and map conductive features and to relate them to the thermal regime of the region. Several conductors could be discerned. The shallowest, at a depth of around 500 m below the surface, was identified as a flow of heated water moving away from the summit: the deepest (--50 km) might be a melt zone in the upper mantle. Of particular interest is an elongate conductor that strikes N 10/sup 0/ W and extends from a depth of 12 km down to 22 km. Because the conductor strike is close to the trend of the chain of Cascade volcanoes and because of the high conductive thermal gradients reported for the area, this feature was initially believed to be a zone of partial melt following the volcanic axis. However, because no teleseismic P wave velocity anomaly has been found, the cause of the conductor is more problematic.

The method evolved from use of a full-flow test loop on a well with a mass flow rate of about 1 x 10/sup 6/ lbm/hr (126 kg/s). It is a simple, effective way to evaluate the effectiveness of inhibitors under field conditions. Five commercial formulations were chosen for field evaluation on the basis of nonflowing, laboratory screening tests at 500/sup 0/F (260/sup 0/C). Four of these formulations from different suppliers controlled calcium carbonate scale deposition as measured by the test method. Two of these could dislodge recently deposited scale that had not age-hardened. Performance-profile diagrams, which were measured for these four effective inhibitors, show the concentration interrelationship between brine calcium and inhibitor concentrations at which the formulations will and will not stop scale formation in the test apparatus. With these diagrams, one formulation was chosen for testing on the full-flow brine line. The composition was tested for 6 weeks and showed a dramatic decrease in the scaling occurring at the flow-control valve. This scaling was about to force a shutdown of a major, long-term flow test being done for reservoir economic evaluations. The inhibitor stopped the scaling, and the test was performed without interruption.","","","Petrolite Corp., St. Louis, MO","","","United States","1986-09-01T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: SPE (Society of Petroleum Engineers) Product.

Along the northeast shore of Yellowstone Lake, maximum relative uplift rates are 10 mm/yr for the period 1923-1975. However, information on deformation prior to historic instrumental records has been lacking. In this study, closely spaced data on elevations of postglacial shoreline terraces around the north end of Yellowstone Lake reveal complex tilting. Though most Holocene deformation is probably magma related, the pattern of shoreline tilting deviates significantly from the historic pattern of roughly symmetric inflation of the caldera. Along the northeast shore, where tilt directions of historic and shoreline deformation are similar, differential uplift of a > 2500-yr-old terrace is roughly 10 m; this gives a maximum uplift rate of 4 mm/yr. These unique Holocene terraces may exist due to episodic deformation because vertical movements affecting the lake outlet directly control lake level.","","","Montana State Univ., Bozeman","","","United States","1986-08-01T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: Geology; (United States); Journal Volume: 14:8","","Medium: X; Size: Pages: 699-702","","","","Journal ID: CODEN: GLGYB","10.1130/0091-7613(1986)14<699:OADOHS>2.0.CO;2","","2016-05-09T00:00:00Z","5749244","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/5749244","","Geology; (United States)","","14:8"

The finite difference algorithm is based on the weak formulation of the moving boundary problem in which a fixed grid of node points is used. Mineral reactions are considered to be in local equilibrium with a fluid phase and may take place either at sharp reaction fronts or distributed homogeneously throughout a control volume. The theory is applied to one- and two-component systems. Analytical solutions to the finite difference equations for the first and second node points provide for a detailed comparison with the exact solution. It was found that on a time scale that is small compared with the time required for the solid to completely dissolve at a single node point, the finite difference approximation yields a spurious behavior for the concentration and solid phase volume fraction. However, the finite difference algorithm reproduces the average behavior of the motion of the reaction front and concentration of the reacting species provided the advance of the front is sufficiently slow resulting in a quasi-steady state solution. A numerical example is presented for the dissolution of quartz at 550 /sup 0/C and 1000 bars to illustrate the general theory.","","","Department of Geology and Geophysics, University of California, Berkeley","","","United States","1986-06-10T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: J.

Considerable agreement between faults delineated by previous geological and geophysical investigations and polarization discontinuities was observed. The polarization plane was observed to be horizontal in high temperature areas but steepened gradually in relatively colder regions in the northern costal area. From the polarization depth distribution two depression zones were observed, separated by an uplifted section elongated in a north-south direction.

The approach leads to an integrated interpretation that accounts for all of the salient features of the data. An initial appraisal of the data indicates excellent agreement with theoretical results for double-porosity reservoirs. For some of the wells, however, the bulk storativity, calculated with the double-porosity model, differs significantly from the average value of this parameter. Furthermore, it increases systematically as the distance between the active and observation well decreases. To explain this particular result, an alternative method of analyzing data from composite reservoirs is presented. The method demonstrates that local permeability variations can result in enormous variations in the apparent storativity without causing variations in the apparent permeability-thickness of the reservoir. A simple graphical technique, based on analyzing systematic variations in the apparent storativity, has been developed to determine the size of the region and the mobility contrast between different regions of the reservoir. By using this technique, the authors show that the observed variations in the storativity are the result of a small, high-permeability region that surrounds the pumped well and is penetrated by several of the observation wells.","","","Lawrence Berkeley Lab.","","","United States","1986-06-01T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: SPE (Society of Petroleum Engineers) Format.

The aim of the method is twofold: to locate and to distinguish between deep and shallow polarizable media. This discrimination is based on the data analysis, which distinguishes TRANSIEL from the conventional IP methods. Two case histories are presented: one related to mineral prospecting and the other to geothermal exploration. The information supplied by TRANSIEL on the deep polarizable layers is checked at each test site by an independent inversion of the recorded transients. At the mineral test site, the method correctly predicts the target location. In this particular survey, the maximum penetration depth of the method is 700 m. At the geothermal test site, a fair correlation is found between IP anomalies and the productive wells. Since the method's penetration depth does not exceed 500 m, the authors believe that the observed IP anomalies are related to reduction phenomena occurring in the overburden and leading to pyrite formation. They suppose that these phenomena are caused by thermochemical exchanges between the reservoir and the overburden above zones of high reservoir permeability.","","","Compagnie Generale de Geophysique, BP56, 91307 Massy, Cedex","","","United States","1986-05-01T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: Geophys.

Major controls on base metal concentrations are temperature, total chloride, and pressure. Higher temperature and higher chloride concentration favor higher metal solubilities as expected, but the pressure effect is opposite to that generally expected and is of considerable importance to the problem of ore mineral transport. At 500/sup 0/C, 0.5 kbar, and 1 m total chloride, Fe, Zn, and Pb solubilities were 8500, 4300, and 8700 ppm, respectively, whereas at 1 kbar they were 4200, 2400, and 2600 ppm, and at 2 kbar, 1700, 800, and 1200 ppm. The experimental results thus indicate that the metals could be carried over long distances on a decreasing pressure gradient so long as the temperature decreases were not sufficient to significantly offset the pressure effect. Such a condition could be approximated by a near-adiabatic transport cooling path.

The mathematical model is taken directly from the literature and is based on material and momentum balances in the wellbore and a heat balance on the entire system including the surrounding media. The transient heat conduction equation is solved analytically by the application of successive Fourier and Laplace transforms. A simple superimpositioning in the time domain permits a matching procedure similar to multiphase flow calculations in pipelines. This is in contrast to standard numerical schemes that involve the direct solution of a set of algebraic and ordinary and partial differential equations typical of reservoir simulation. The pressure-drop calculations in the wellbore account for the slip concept and the prevailing flow regimes by means of standard two-phase correlations. The validity of the method is demonstrated by comparison with results of other numerical simulation studies and actual field data for both steam injection and geothermal production.","","","BP Petroleum Development Co.","","","United States","1986-03-01T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: SPE (Society of Petroleum Engineers) Reserv.

The implications of adsorption on material-balance calculations and on well test analysis are determined by incorporation of adsorption effects into existing models. New analysis methods introduced here provide a more realistic estimate of the nature and extent of the vapor-dominated zone. The methods result in a considerable reduction in the estimated formation thickness and suggest that fracture porosity has been underestimated with conventional models for a naturally fractured reservoir. The presence of noncondensable gases in the geothermal fluid has a profound effect on the thermodynamics associated with vapor/liquid equilibrium and adsorption. Noncondensable gases can cause the dewpoint pressure of a noncondensable gas/water mixture to be elevated substantially, above the vapor pressure for pure water at reservoir temperature. Hence, the presence of gas in geothermal steam extends the pressure range where vapor adsorption phenomena are in effect. Monitoring of gas production in the produced geothermal fluids provides additional data useful in evaluating adsorption effects. The adsorption phenomenon in reserve estimation is of considerable importance. This work shows that a reserve estimate based on geologic evidence and the thermodynamic properties of steam could be as much as an order of magnitude lower than the actual mass of water present.","","","Univ. of Alaska","","","United States","1986-03-01T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: SPE (Society of Petroleum Engineers) Reserv.

This observation is surprising since classical hydraulic fracturing theory predicts the creation of a tensile opening of a cavity in response to fluid pressure. Very small long period events, similar to long period earthquakes observed at volcanoes, were found to occur during four hydraulic fracturing experiments carried out at Fenton Hill, New Mexico. Since the long period earthquakes occur in the same region as the shear type events, it is concluded that the unusual character of the long period earthquake waveforms is due to a source effect and not a path effect. The occurrence of long period earthquakes during hydraulic fracturing could indicate tensile fracturing. Many waveforms of these events are identical, which implies that these events represent repeated activation of a given source. A proposed source for these long period events is the sudden opening of a channel that connects two cracks filled with fluid at different pressures. The sizes of the two cracks differ, which causes two or more peaks to appear in the spectra, each peak being associated with one physical dimension of each crack. From the frequencies at which spectral peaks occur, crack lengths are estimated to be between 3 and 20m.","","","Earth and Space Sciences Division, Los Alamos National Laboratory","","","United States","1986-02-01T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: Geophys.

The results show that to analyze correctly the pressure transients governed by a moving thermal front, the fluid-property values must correspond to the temperature of the injected fluid. For pressure falloff tests and for injection tests conducted in a well cooled by previous injection of drilling, however, the physical properties of the in-situ reservoir fluids must be used. The application of conventional isothermal methods for calculating skin values from injection and falloff data will give erroneous results. A new method is presented for calculating skin values from injection and falloff data that accurately corrects for nonisothermal effects. Examples are given to illustrate this analysis method. The technique is applied to the analysis of injection test data from a well located in the East Mesa geothermal field in southern California.","","","Lawrence Berkeley Labs.","","","United States","1986-02-01T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: SPE (Society of Petroleum Engineers) Format.

Therefore, the authors have been accumulating technical data on a special cement consisting of 2CaO/SiO/sub 2/ and silica. In this paper, strength development at 290 to 842/sup 0/F (143 to 450/sup 0/C) was investigated for the mixtures of three 2CaO/SiO/sub 2/ modifications (..gamma.., ..beta.., and ..cap alpha..) and quartz.

Within the limits of this experiment, the authors conclude that the strength of 2CaO/SiO/sub 2/-quartz mixtures depends on 2CaO/SiO/sub 2/ modifications, curing temperature, and curing time, but the influences of curing pressure and increasing rate of temperature are relatively minor. Moreover, they assume that the difference of reaction rate of 2CaO/SiO/sub 2/ and quartz, the type of hydration products, and the producing conditions will result in the difference of strength, depending on 2CaO/SiO/sub 2/ modification.","","","Ube Industries Ltd.","","","United States","1986-01-01T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: SPE (Society of Petroleum Engineers) Product.

This study examined selected species of rodents, fish, and lichen. Elevated amounts of chemical elements were found in their tissues. It is not clear if this accumulation is the result of geothermal development or due to naturally high backgrounds of these elements in the region. However, today these element loads serve as reference points for both developers and regulators. The CEC awarded a second grant in July 1985.

In general, the residents of the County of Hawaii favor some form of geothermal development. Issues on geothermal development of concern to the public were similar to those mentioned in the 1982 study. Basically, the issues amount to a trade-off between the economic advantages and the environmental problems of geothermal development. The strong points in favor of development include a perceived need for more energy, a strong preference for alternate energy forms over petroleum, perceived benefits for the local economy and the employment rates, and the possibility that development may reduce or contain utility bills. On the other hand, it appears that geothermal development will cause health problems for those who live near the wells, be hazardous to flora and fauna in the Puna area, and create noise and odor above tolerable levels.

Several homes and one hotel are heated by the hot springs; about 20-25 homes use the springs as their hot water supply; 10-12 homes use the water for heated swimming pools; and one greenhouse uses the resource as a heat source. Even though historical records show the resource dried up sometime between 1910 and 1920, wells drilled over 100 feet still reach the hot water and still seem to be producing their original volume.","","","California Dept. of Conservation (USA)","","","United States","1986-01-01T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: Geotherm.

Anomalously high heat flow has been discovered coming from the oceanic crust and continental margin to the west of the Antarctic Peninsula. The purpose of this study was to examine the thermal state of one section of the Antarctic Peninsula where young oceanic lithosphere has been subducted. At the time of arrival of the ridge crest to the trench, subduction and spreading of the ridge both stopped. A heat-flow anomaly should still be present around the subduction zone since newly formed crust was in the trench at the time of collision. Heat-flow patterns around trench arc systems subducting old ocean crust in the West Pacific show a distinctive low heat-flow zone centered around the trench axis. Locations of the heat-flow stations were chosen to determine best the thermal state of the surviving flank of the spreading center as well as that of the collision and subduction complex. A table gives a summary of the locations and heat-flow data for each successful measurement.

The principal conclusions drawn from the study were as follows. At current discharge rates, the contribution of the city's pump and inject system to the annual fluctuations in water level within the geothermal aquifer is very small and locally contained. Since about 1973, average pumpage-to-waste has exceeded average annual recharge, and the results of modeling with inverse VARFLOW suggest that 50% or more of the long-term declines in water levels since that date are due to excessive pumpage-to-waste. There is a high level of correlation between changes in water level due to pumping and average ambient temperature, at least on a daily basis.

Geothermal water is produced from the alluvial deposits underlying the GRA. Chemical analyses of water from 22 wells throughout the GRA indicate the geothermally heated water north of the Mission Creek fault is high in sodium and sulfate, differing from the water samples south of the fault, which is high in calcium and bicarbonate. The results of the study indicate that meteoric water, originating in the San Bernardino Mountains, flows southeasterly toward the GRA along the Mission Creek fault. Geothermometry indicates that the water is heated to temperatures as high as 110/sup 0/C at depths between 2.7 km and 3.0 km. The geothermal water ascends along fractures near the intersections of the subsidiary Blind Canyon and Long Canyon faults. After cresting in the shallow alluvial rock, some geothermal water flows northeasterly and southwesterly.

Calcite from this and other specimens is significantly enriched in strontium-87 (the strontium-87/strontium-86 ratio equals 0.71417 +/- 0.00002), carbon-12 (delta carbon-13 equals -22.9 parts per thousand, PDB standard) and oxygen-16 (delta oxygen-18 equals -21.1 parts per thousand, standard mean ocean water) compared with calcite of marine origin. The enrichment in carbon-12 is similar to that of calcite associated with coal in the Allan Hills. The enrichment in oxygen-16 indicates that the calcite from the Elephant Moraine could only have precipitated in isotopic equilibrium with glacial melt water. Therefore, the temperature at which the black calcite precipitated from water of that isotope composition was about 85/sup 0/C. A temperature of this magnitude implies that the black calcite formed as a result of volcanic activity under the east antarctic ice sheet. The enrichment of the black calcite in carbon-12 suggests that it formed in part from carbon dioxide derived from the coal seams of the Weller Formation in the Beacon Supergroup. The isotopic composition of strontium in the black calcite is similar to that of carbonate beds and concretions in the Beacon rocks of southern Victoria Land. A volcanic-hydrothermal origin is also consistent with the very low total organic carbon content of 0.15% in the calcite.","","","Ohio State Univ., Columbus (USA)","","","United States","1986-01-01T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: Antarct.

The first impetus for the establishment of such a framework was the early successful development of The Geysers geothermal field in northern California. The second impetus came form the oil embargo of 1972 which also raised the demand for the establishment of federal and state financial incentives to encourage more rapid development of geothermal energy. The legal and institutional framework developed by the states and the federal government often differed substantially in format, content, and direction. Too often the legal and institutional framework established left as many questions unanswered as answered, and in some cases, the framework has proven to be more of an obstacle to development than an aid. From an examination of how the states and the federal government have addressed the needs of geothermal development, and how the courts have interpreted some of their decisions, it has become clear that in order to ensure that the legal and institutional framework is adequate to serve the needs of geothermal development, it must address, at a minimum, the following topics: (1) providing developers with access and a priority right to carry out exploration and development activities; (2) carefully characterizing the resources so as to minimize conflicts with other natural resources; (3) establishing ownership; and (4) giving careful consideration to such lease terms as rentals and royalties, renewals, and diligence requirements.

These three soils have low monocalcium phosphate-acetic acid extractable SO/sub 4/-S (<3.1 kg/ha) and would be expected to be S deficient with respect to corn (Zea mays L.) Winter wheat response to S application was investigated on the Kenansville and Dothan soils, while the N x S interaction was studies on the Pactolus soil. Yields were not significantly influenced by S application and averaged 5.6 Mg/ha for the Kenansville and 4.3 Mg/ha for the Dothan soils. In the N x S interaction study, yield increased linearly with increased N application, and N and P tissue concentrations were increased with N application. These data indicate that S concentrations of 0.20% and a N/S ratio of 18 in the flag leaf at Feekes growth stage 10 is sufficient for high yields. The absence of S deficiency in these relatively high-yielding experiments on coarse textured soils with a low levels of extractable SO/sub 4/-S may be related to atmospheric accretions during much of the wheat growing season.","","","Virginia Polytechnic Institute and State Univ., Blacksburg","","","United States","1986-01-01T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: Commun.

Petrographic features, such as quartz xenocrysts in basalt, sieved plagioclase phenocrysts, broad compositional ranges of phenocrysts within single samples, and occurrence of commingled bombs and lava flows, indicate that many of the intermediate-composition rocks formed by mixing of basaltic magma with silicic material. A large volume, highly silicic center near Haiwee Ridge evolved 3.1-2.5 m.y. ago. This system erupted high-silica rhyolite air-fall and ash-flow tuff and in its later stages rhyodacite lava flows. The evolution of the Coso volcanic field, from early basalt to polygenetic intermediate-composition volcanoes to a comparatively large-volume silicic center, is thought to reflect systematic changes in the least principal stress (S/sub 3/) and the related tectonic extension rate. Beginning about 4 m.y. ago, basalt was erupted onto a surface of little relief, ponding in a shallow north-trending basin. Intermediate-composition magma was produced mainly between 3.5 and 3.3 m.y., at a time when S/sub 3/ may have decreased and the extension rate increased. Thus, Pliocene volcanism progressed through a sequence of compositions and eruptive patterns that reflect the transition from tectonic stability to extension.","","","","","","United States","1986-01-01T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: U.S. Geol.

These problems are superimposed in the Denver, Kennedy and Williston Basins where complex geothermal gradients derive both from large contrasts among thermal conductivities of strata and from regional groundwater flow. The occurrence and magnitude of advective heat flow within the Denver, Kennedy and Williston Basins is conceptually consistent with simple models that relate groundwater flow to the piezometric surface and to subsurface structures, i.e., folds and faults. An advective heat flow of +25 mW/m/sup 2/ has been determined for an area in the eastern margin of the Denver Basin, and quantities of +35 mW/m/sup 2/ and +10 MW/m/sup 2/ have been determined respectively for parts of the southeastern and northeastern parts of the Williston Basin. A detailed analysis of bottom hole temperatures obtained from drill holes in the area of the Billings Anticline in the Williston Basin indicates that information on subsurface structures and groundwater flow may be obtained from heat flow studies. Additional information that may be derived from these heat flow studies includes: the occurrence and nature of geothermal resources, oil source rock maturation and secondary migration of petroleum, formation and deposition of strata-bound ores. 43 references.","","","Univ. of North Dakota, Grand Forks","","","United States","1985-12-01T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: Interstate Oil Compact Com.

In the US 95 % of all generating capacity comes from The Geysers steam field in Northern California with only 5% coming from various hot water fields. However, this ratio is beginning to change as more hot water projects reach maturity. Thirty percent of new capacity now under construction and planned will be derived from hot water geothermal fields.

Since some of these values are lower than expected for Precambrian shields, it is important to find out whether or not they are representative of the entire shield before trying to derive its thermal structure. In this paper, we present new heat flow determinations from seven sites of the West African shield.

The model SALINP provided good agreement with the observed salinities for 1960-80. While SALINP was not overly sensitive to one-year changes in any of the major inputs, a change in the historical means of the Imperial Valley runoff and evaporative loss inputs produced a significant effect on future predictions. The proposed water conservation measures caused the predicted Salton Sea salinity for 2000 to greatly exceed 40,000 ppm, the level at which adverse effects to wildlife are believed to occur. The possible geothermal development also produced predicted salinities considerably above 40,000 ppm. The salinity predictions for solar ponds by themselves and in conjunction with geothermal development were below 45,000 ppm for 2000.

A preferred orientation N10/sup 0/W-S10/sup 0/E, +- 10/sup 0/ and a less prominant E-W orientation of borehole elongation, was observed on two runs of the dipmeter. Comparisons of borehole geometry determined using the televiewer and the dipmeter show that both tools give the same orientation of borehole elongation provided that the zone of elongation is longer than 30 cm. Comparisons of dipmeter caliper data with orientation of in situ stress and natural fractures, obtained from hydrofracturing tests and televiewer data show that the N10/sup 0/W-S10/sup 0/E borehole elongations (1) are axisymmetric, (2) are aligned with the minimum horizontal stress S/sub h/, and (3) are not associated with natural fractures intersecting the well. These elongations are interpreted as stress-induced well bore breakouts. The E-W elongation direction is characterized by an asymmetric borehole cross section in thinly bedded rocks and is not caused by breakouts. This asymmetric geometry can be discriminated from breakouts using the oriented electric measurements provided by the dipmeter. This study demonstrates that the dipmeter can be used to determine the orientation of S/sub h/ (by mapping breakouts), confirming the results of earlier less detailed studies, and provides a firm basis for mapping regional stress patterns using existing dipmeter data.","","","Schlumberger-Doll Research, Ridgefield, Connecticut","","","United States","1985-06-10T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: J.

This well, which was drilled at the outer margin of the Appalachian Fold and Thrust Belt in the Appalachian Plateau, penetrates approximately 1540 m of lower Paleozoic sedimentary rocks and terminates 60 m into the Precambrian marble basement. Analysis of the hydraulic fracturing tests indicates that the minimum horizontal principal stress increases in a nearly linear fashion from 9.9 +- 0.2 MPa at 593 m to 30.6 +- 0.4 MPa at 1482 m. The magnitude of the maximum horizontal principal stress increases in a less regular fashion from 13.8 +- 1.2 MPa to 49.0 +- 2.0 MPa over the same depth range. The magnitudes of the horizontal principal stresses relative to the calculated overburden stress are somewhat lower than is the norm for this region and are indicative of a strike-slip faulting regime that, at some depths, is transitional to normal faulting. As expected from the relative aseismicity of central New York State, however, analysis of the magnitudes of the horizontal principal stresses indicates, at least to a depth of 1.5 km, that frictional failure on favorably oriented preexisting fault planes is unlikely.","","","U.S. Geological Survey, Menlo Park, California","","","United States","1985-06-10T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: J.

"Historical hydrothermal evolutionary facets revealed within the exploited Geysers Steam Field","Hebein, J J","15 GEOTHERMAL ENERGY; GEYSERS GEOTHERMAL FIELD; GEOLOGIC HISTORY; GEOLOGY; GEOTHERMAL RESOURCES; RESOURCE DEVELOPMENT; GEOTHERMAL FIELDS; RESOURCES; 150101* - Geothermal Energy- Resources & Availability- USA- (-1989)","Aside from being the world's largest contiguous producing geothermal resource, The Geysers Steam Field offers geoscientists and reservoir engineers an intricate view of how several successive hydrothermal systems have evolved into a rare type of vapor resource over the last several million years of geologic history. It appears that several liquid-dominated episodes, driven by successive igneous intrusive heat fluxes, are recorded in the evolution of the present system being exploited. Deep resurgent igneous activity (thermally retrograde), perhaps presently located under some portions of the steam field, is responsible for the current heat flux which hydraulically drives the vaporstatic steam within the reservoir fracture system(s). The Geysers reservoir(s) were formerly huge liquid-dominated hydrothermal cells, similar to huge active and fossil liquid systems in several other worldwide locations. The current vapor-domination has partially contributed to a pronounced tectonic cavernous fracture system while rendering many reservoir manifestations out of equilibrium with respect to numerous former processes. The relevant significance of this geothermal resource due to recent interpretations of public and privileged steam field resource data is discussed.","","","Diamond Shamrock Thermal Power Co., Santa Rosa, CA","","","United States","1985-06-01T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: Bull., Geotherm.

Much of the world's geothermal and mineral resource base has formed as a direct result of magmatic activity associated with subduction-related volcanic arcs. The Cascade Range is the only active subduction-related volcanic arc in the conterminous US. It is also one of the best known volcanic arcs in the world. Its great size, over 1300 km long, and high potential for geothermal resources underscore the economic importance of the Cascade arc to the nation. It is also of worldwide significance, because it represents a unique end member in the spectrum of subduction-related volcanic arcs. It is related to nearly aseismic subduction of a very small, very hot oceanic plate in the dying phases of the subduction process. Development of a comprehensive geologic model for the Cascade arc, when combined with data from arcs related to rapid subduction of old oceanic lithosphere, will provide a general model for subduction-related volcanic arcs throughout the world.","","","Oregon Dept. of Geology and Mineral Industries, Portland","","","United States","1985-06-01T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: Bull., Geotherm.

The essential feature of this model is that steam and steam-heated discharge at relatively high altitudes in Lassen Volcanic National Park (LVNP) and liquid discharge with high chloride concentrations at relatively low altitudes outside LVNP are both fed by an upflow of high-enthalpy two-phase fluid with the Park. Liquid flows laterally away from the upflow area toward the areas of high-chloride discharge, and steam rises through a vapor-dominated zone to feed the steam and steam-heated features. Numerical simulations show that several conditions are necessary for the development of this type of system, including large-scale topographic relief; an initial period of convective heating within an upflow zone followed by a change in hydrologic or geologic conditions that initiates drainage of liquid from portions of the upflow zone; and low-permeability barriers that inhibit the movement of cold water into the vapor zone. Simulations of thermal fluid withdrawal south of LVNP, carried out in order to determine the effects of such withdrawal on portions of the hydrothermal system within the Park, generally showed decreases in pressure and liquid saturation beneath the vapor zone which resulted in temporary increases and subsequent decreases in the rate of upflow of steam. A generalized production-injection scenario that could mitigate the effects of development on both the high-chloride and steam-fed features was identified.","","","Geological Survey, Menlo Park, CA","","","United States","1985-06-01T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: Water Resour.

Wellhead units are situated next to a production wellpad and are generally supplied with hot water or steam from one or several production wells. Several features distinguish geothermal wellhead generating units from a central geothermal power plant. One is that the gross output of wellhead units is generally in the 1 to 15 MW range, with the largest offered now being 25 MW. Another is that wellhead generating units have very short steam lines (central geothermal power plants characteristically have long, interconnecting cross-country pipelines to transport the steam from the various wellpads to the central unit). The most characteristic feature of a wellhead generation facility is its modular construction. Usually, the smaller turbine-generator modules (up to 15 MW) are completely assembled at the factory on a single skid. The larger units (up to 25 MW) are usually assembled on two separate skids to ease shipment; one skid supports the turbine and its auxiliary equipment, and the other supports the generator and associated equipment. The advantages and disadvantages of the wellhead type generating units are discussed.","","","Gibbs and Hill, Inc., San Jose, CA","","","United States","1985-05-01T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: Bull., Geotherm.

In an early model, the effect of reservoir parameters on production characteristics was studied. However, this model did not include slip between the phases which is important in most geothermal wells. There is, and probably will be for some time, debate on the exact correlations that best represent the conditions in a wellbore.

For the intact sample, V/sub p/ increases from 3.52 km/s to 4.16 km/s as P/sub e/ goes from 3 to 50 MPa. With increasing temperature, V/sub p/ decreases at rates of about 3% per 100 C at P/sub e/ of 5 MPa and about 1.5% per 100 C at P/sub e/ of 38 MPa. Data from the fractured sample are qualitatively similar, but velocities are about 10% lower. For both intact and fractured samples, p increases less than 15% as P/sub e/ increases from 2.5 MPa to 50 MPa. Although both samples show a larger decrease in resistivity with increasing temperature, most of this change is attributed to the decrease in resistivity of the pore fluid over that temperature range. For both samples, k decreases with increasing pressure and temperature. The intact sample permeability varies from 23 mD at 3 MPa and 20 C to less than 1 mD at 50 MPa and 150 C. The permeability of the fractured sample varies from 676 mD at 3 MPa and 20 C to less than 1 mD at 40 MPa and 190 C. The effect of the fracture on k vanishes after several pressure cycles and above about 100 C.

Because the binary-cycle system yields the same amount of electricity as the direct-flash system with only two-thirds the amount of geothermal brine, fuel costs are lower, making it possible to develop moderate-temperature resources that would otherwise be uneconomical.","","","","","","United States","1985-04-01T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: Geotherm.

In these studies the multiple-interacting-continua (MINC) method is employed for the modeling of idealized fractured reservoirs. Simulations are carried out for a five-spot well pattern with various well spacings, fracture spacings, and injection fractions. The production rates from the wells are calculated using a deliverability model. The results of the studies show that injection into two-phase fractured reservoirs increases flow rates and decreases enthalpies of producing wells. These two effects offset each other so that injection tends to have small effects on the usable energy output of production wells in the short term. However, if a sufficiently large fraction of the produced fluids is injected, the fracture system may become liquidfilled and an increased steam rate is obtained. Our studies show that injection greatly increases the long-term energy output from wells because it helps extract heat from the reservoir rocks. If a high fraction of the produced fluids is injected, the ultimate energy recovery will increase many-fold.","","","Lawrence Berkeley Laboratory","","","United States","1985-04-01T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: SPEJ, Soc.

It is shown that the presence of CO/sub 2/ has a large effect on the thermodynamic conditions of a reservoir in the natural state, especially on temperature distributions and phase compositions. The gas will expand two-phase zones and increase gas saturations to enable flow of CO/sub 2/ through the system. During exploitation, the early pressure drop primarily results from ''degassing'' of the system. This process can cause a very rapid initial pressure drop, on the order of megapascals, depending on the initial partial pressure of CO/sub 2/. The flowing gas content from wells can provide information on in-place gas saturations and relative permeability curves that apply at a given geothermal resource. Site-specific studies are made for the gas-rich, two-phase reservoir at the Ohaaki geothermal field in New Zealand. A simple lumped-parameter model and a vertical column model are applied to the field data. The results obtained agree well with the natural thermodynamic state of the Ohaaki field (pressure and temperature profiles) and a partial pressure of 1.5 to 2.5 MPa (217 to 363 psi) is calculated in the primary reservoirs. The models also agree reasonably well with field data obtained during exploitation of the field. The treatment of thermophysical properties of H/sub 2/O/CO/sub 2/ mixtures for different phase compositions is summarized.","","","Univ. of Auckland","","","United States","1985-04-01T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: SPEJ, Soc.

To obtain batches, a reliable set-up should be designed and constructed to examine and measure all the properties that may possibly change under the prevailing conditions. A scaled dynamic flow loop is designed and built in the Department of Petroleum Engineering at the University of Petroleum and Minerals, Dhahran. This set-up can simulate efficiently the bottomhole condition e.g. high temperature up to 450/sup 0/F, high shear rate up to 50,000 sec/sup -1/. The system pressure is maintained above the saturation pressure of water at the test temperature. Dynamic filteration rate and the corrosion rate is monitored instantaneously at wide range of bottomhole conditions. The flow parameters NandK,/tau/, ..gamma.. etc., are obtained by measuring ..delta..P across the 3-tube viscometer using the DP 15-150 pressure differential transducers. The ambient properties are measured by Baroid multi-speed viscometer and compared with data obtained from the loop. Two batches composed of sepiolite and polymer were tested. Effective viscosity is increased significantly at high temperature for the first and second batches. The consistency and thermal stability of these fluids may be attributed to the transfer of sepiolite to smectite at high temperature and high shear.","","","Univ. of Petroleum and Minerals","","","United States","1985-03-01T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: Soc.

The thermal conductivity of rock is normally determined by measuring the properties of core samples which have been removed from the well. The major problem with this is the fact that thermal properties are dependent on the moisture content of the rock. This moisture content is very likely altered in transportation and storage. This paper presents an analysis which serves as the basis of a transient heat flux probe measurement that may be used to determine the thermal conductivity and diffusivity in situ. Such in-situ measurements would overcome the disadvantages of core samples and may also be used when core samples are not available. This analysis also provides a method of estimating the time required in order to obtain valid results. The analysis indicates rather long test times may be required for accurate results. However, it does provide a basis for evaluating the results of measurements taken for shorter times. The effects of contact thermal resistance between the probe, the well casing, and the formation are evaluated.","","","School of Aerospace, Mechanical and Nuclear Engineering, University of Oklahoma, Norman, Okla.","","","United States","1985-03-01T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: J.

The system investigated consists of a single recharging-discharging well pair, in a horizontally extensive aquifer, with either power generation or space heating as the surface application. The space heating systems investigated are direct heating, heat pumps, and a combination of direct heating and heat pumps. The thermodynamic performance parameters considered are the effectiveness and fossil fuel savings. Due to the interaction between the surface and subsurface systems, the load conditions and geologic conditions play important roles in determining the thermodynamic optimum operation. For high temperature resources (higher than about 435 K), power generation yields the best performance and is therefore recommended. The relative desirability of the combination (direct heating and heat pumps) requires consideration of the load condition, resource temperature and other geologic conditions. Such evaluations for these automatically determine the appropriate ranges of direct heating. The thermodynamic optimum operation of each system is also dependent on these same parameters, as well as on the injection temperature.","","","Department of Mechanical Engineering, Chung-Buk University, Cheong-Ju, Chung Buk-Do","","","United States","1985-03-01T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: J.

The results of the study indicate that the Heber geothermal anomaly is sustained by the upflow of hot water through a central zone of relatively high permeability. The best model suggests that in its natural state the system is recharged at depth by a 15-MW/sub t/ (megawatts thermal) (reference temperature 0/sup 0/C) convective heat source. The existence of an axisymmetric convection pattern, whose axis coincides with the center of the Heber anomaly, is also suggested. At the lower part of the ascending hot water plume the deep recharge water mixes with colder water moving laterally toward the axis of the system. In the upper part the rising plume spreads radially outward after reaching the bottom of the cap rock, at about 550 m depth. The model results suggest that the so-called cap rock is quite permeable (5 x 10/sup -15/ m/sup 2/) with convection controlling its temperature distribution. The results also show reduced permeability (10 x 10/sup -15/ m/sup 2/) of the upper zones in the outer region of the system that may be due to mineral precipitation. In modeling the exploitation of the field the generation rate is allowed to build up over a period of 10 years; after that 30 years of constant power production is assumed. Full (100%) injection of the spent brines is considered; the fluids being injected 2250 m (''near injection'') or 4250 m (''far injection'') from the center of the system. The study shows that a maximum of 6000 kg/s (equivalent to approximately 300 MW/sub e/ (megawatts electric) of fluids may be produced for the near injection case but only 3000 kg/s (equivalent to approximately 150 MW/sub e/) for the far injection case.","","","Earth Sciences Division, Lawrence Berkeley Laboratory, University of California","","","United States","1985-01-10T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: J.

An historical survey establishes that formerly the response time of the spring to minima in cumulative deviation of rainfall was about 8 years consistent with an analogue model of the field. The recent response time, less than one year, is consistent with the model only when the effects of exploitation are included, indicating that withdrawal from wells is causing a major decline in the field.","","","Department of Physics, The University of Auckland","","","United States","1985-01-01T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: Geophys.

Vaporization of only a few percent of a solution can decrease the proton concentration by several orders of magnitude when the CO/sub 2//H..mu.. and CO/sub 2//..sigma..SO/sub 4/ concentration ratios are initially high. The relationship between the proton, CO/sub 2/, and ..sigma..SO/sub 4/ concentrations prior to boiling to the proton concentration after boiling is defined explicitly by a few simple equations. These equations along with the solubilities of calcite and anhydrite constitute the chemical boundary conditions for significant mineral deposition by boiling. Physical variables such as the heat budget and the restrictions on the partitioning of mass between liquid and vapor, although significant, are subordinate to the compositional variables in determining the chemical evolution of a boiling hydrothermal solution. Mineral and metal complex stoichiometries in combination with the relative volatilities of CO/sub 2/ and H/sub 2/S determine the general sequence of mineral deposition during boiling. These major variables, many other minor variables, and the multiple interactions thereof are accounted for rigorously. The amount and paragenesis of ore and gangue minerals deposited by boiling are presented for numerous hypothetical hydrothermal systems. Analysis of these results suggests that boiling is perhaps the most generally effective ore depositional mechanism at the conditions operative in many boiling hydrothermal systems. 45 references, 13 figures.","","","Oak Ridge National Lab., TN","","","United States","1985-01-01T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: Econ.

As a result, the algae were grown in large plastic bags in order to prevent contamination by extraneous organisms.

"Inversion Approach For Thermal Data From A Convecting Hydrothermal System","Kasameyer, P; Younker, L; Hanson, J","15 GEOTHERMAL ENERGY; BOUNDARY CONDITIONS; FLUID FLOW; HEAT SOURCES; HYDROTHERMAL SYSTEMS; PERMEABILITY; SALTON SEA GEOTHERMAL FIELD; TEMPERATURE GRADIENTS; Geothermal Legacy","Hydrothermal systems are often studied by collecting thermal gradient data and temperature depth curves. These data contain important information about the flow field, the evolution of the hydrothermal system, and the location and nature of the ultimate heat sources. Thermal data are conventionally interpreted by the ''forward'' method; the thermal field is calculated based on selected initial conditions and boundary conditions such as temperature and permeability distributions. If the calculated thermal field matches the data, the chosen conditions are inferred to be possibly correct. Because many sets of initial conditions may produce similar thermal fields, users of the ''forward'' method may inadvertently miss the correct set of initial conditions. Analytical methods for ''inverting'' data also allow the determination of all the possible solutions consistent with the definition of the problem. In this paper we suggest an approach for inverting thermal data from a hydrothermal system, and compare it to the more conventional approach. We illustrate the difference in the methods by comparing their application to the Salton Sea Geothermal Field by Lau (1980a) and Kasameyer, et al. (1984). In this particular example, the inverse method was used to draw conclusions about the age and total rate of fluid flow into the hydrothermal system.","","","Lawrence Livermore National Lab.

The instrument is therefore useful in assessing the energy available in reservoirs and in evaluating the economic potential of drilling wells for geothermal energy. Two rodlike transducers are suspended by a cable in a borehole. Both transducers are held in position long enough to come to thermal equilibrium with the surrounding earth. One of the transducers has a much higher thermal conductivity than the other. The transducers are surrounded by water or drilling mud, which serves as a heatcoupling medium. The temperature gradient along both transducers is measured. The measured thermal gradient of the lower transducer and its thermal conductivity are then compared with the temperature gradient and conductivity of the upper transducer (using a mathematical heat conduction model) to obtain the vertical heat flux in the surrounding earth. The procedure is repeated at various depths and in other boreholes so that heat flux can be mapped in terms of depth and position in the field. Each transducer contains a thermopile with about 50 thermocouple junction sets so that large output signals are obtained without voltage amplification. The upper and lower junctions are arrayed in a circle with opposing junctions connected in series by dissimilar metals.","","","","","","United States","1984-12-01T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: Geotherm.

"Subsidence due to geothermal fluid withdrawal","Narasimhan, T. N.; Goyal, K. P.","15 GEOTHERMAL ENERGY","Single-phase and two-phase geothermal reservoirs are currently being exploited for power production in Italy, Mexico, New Zealand, the United States, and elsewhere. Vertical ground displacements of up to 4.5 m and horizontal ground displacements of up to 0.5 m have been observed at Wairakei, New Zealand, that are clearly attributable to the resource exploitation. Similarly, vertical displacements of about 0.13 m have been recorded at The Geysers, California. No significant ground displacements that are attributable to large-scale fluid production have been observed at Larderello, Italy, and Cerro Prieto, Mexico. In this paper, observations show that subsidence due to geothermal fluid production is characterized by such features as an offset of the subsidence bowl from the main area of production, time-lag between production and subsidence, and nonlinear stress-strain relationships. Several plausible conceptual models, of varying degrees of sophistication, have been proposed to explain the observed features. At present, relatively more is known about the physical mechanisms that govern subsidence than the relevant thermal mechanisms. Finally, although attempts have been made to simulate observed geothermal subsidence, the modeling efforts have been seriously limited by a lack of relevant field data needed to sufficiently characterize the complex field system.","Geological Society of America","","Lawrence Berkeley National Lab.

Tests were analyzed using both diffusion theory and an explicit, coupled hydraulic/mechanical computer code. At low fluid overpressures, the permeabilities, in terms of uniform diffusion, were in the range of 1 to 10 ..mu..d, rising to about 60 ..mu..d at overpressures of about 725 psi (5 MPa).

This first paper describes the geological settings of the field and the analysis of well test data. The geothermal system at Krafla is very complex, with a single-phase liquid reservoir overlying a two-phase reservoir. The reservoir rocks are volcanic with sequences of basalt flows, hyloclastics, and intrusions. The fluid flow in the reservoir is fracture dominated. Considerable pressure transient data from injection tests have been gathered from the Krafla wells. These data are analyzed to yield the transmissivity distribution in the reservoir system. As the data are complicated by various factors (wellbore effects, nonisothermal effects, two-phase flow, and fractured rocks) the applicability of conventional well test analysis methods is questionable. The authors have developed a methodology to analyze injection tests for such systems. The results obtained show that the transmissivity of the Krafla reservoir is low, averaging 2 Darcy meters (Dm). The average transmissivity of most commercially successful geothermal fields is an order of magnitude higher.","","","Univ. of California, Berkeley","","","United States","1984-11-01T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: Water Resour.

A general lumped parameter model is developed which can be used to obtain rough estimates of the generating capacity of a geothermal field based on the size of the wellfield, the average formation porosity, and the amount of recharge to the system. The model is applied to the old wellfield at Krafla. More sophisticated calculations of the generating capacity of the Krafla field are also performed using distributed-parameter models. Two-dimensional areal models of the various reservoir regions at Krafla are developed and their generating capacities (MW/sub e/) evaluated. The results obtained indicate that the old wellfield can sustain steam production of 30 MW/sub e/ for 30 years. The estimated power potential of the new wellfield is 20 MW/sub e/ for 30 years. To obtain the required steam production several additional wells may be drilled in the old and new wellfields.","","","Univ. of California, Berkeley","","","United States","1984-11-01T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: Water Resour.

To prolong the resource and to avoid degrading surface waters, the underground injection of the heat-depleted brine is increasingly becoming an accepted practice. Many brines, particularly those from the higher temperature reservoirs, undergo severe chemical disequilibrium during the energy extraction process because of temperature and/or pressure changes. As the brine regains equilibrium, precipitates form that can plug the injection process. Several approaches to treating the brine prior to injection have been used, tested, proposed, or are possible. These approaches are discussed.","","","Pacific Northwest Lab., Richland, WA","","","United States","1984-11-01T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: Bull., Geotherm. Resour.

The completion contract on the $87-million project-one of two geothermic plants the state is building-has been put on hold.

Numerous high-ranking state officials, both past and present are concerned that the massive steel and concrete structure under construction near the old Geysers resort in Sonoma County could turn into a permanent monument to poor planning.

The second phase of the Assessment Program undertook a series of field studies, utilizing a variety of geothermal exploration techniques, in an effort to confirm the presence of thermal anomalies in the identified PGRA's and, if confirmed, to more completely characterize them. A total of 15 PGRA's on four of the five major islands in the Hawaiian chain were subject to at least a preliminary field analysis. The remaining five were not considered to have sufficient resource potential to warrant study under the personnel and budget constraints of the program. The island of Kauai was not studied during the current phase of investigation. Geothermal field studies were not considered to be warranted due to the absence of significant geochemical or geophysical indications of a geothermal resource. The great age of volcanism on this island would further suggest that should a thermal resource be present, it would be of low temperature.

One example is the hot dry rock geothermal energy project operated by the Camborne School of Mines in Cornwall, UK, where a cumulative injected volume of over 300,000 m/sup 3/ was pumped into 2,m deep boreholes in granite. During the course of these injections the location of pressurized water was followed by means of microseismic detection. It was concluded that the continuing downward growth of the stimulated region was associated with a shearing source mechanism. This result is explained in terms of the anisotropic in situ stress field interacting with critically aligned joints. The downward growth is closely related to the ratio of the maximum to minimum principal effective stress. The existence of the downward growth implies an eventual curvature in the maximum stress envelope if shear failures are not to be incipient under hydrostatic pore pressure conditions. This curvature implies that upward shear growth would occur during injections at greater depths. These results are potentially of general application in strong jointed rock with a markedly anisotropic in situ stress field. 57 references.","","","Camborne School of Mines, Penryn, England","","","United States","1984-10-01T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: Int.

With water at 100/sup 0/C as the pore fluid, permeability first decreased then increased during loading to peak stress. Thereafer, permeability decreased as much as 50% over time, even though sample volumetric strain indicated continuous dilatant creep. A silica-rich precipitate was found at the ends of the specimens and etch pits found on quartz grain surfaces. From these observations, we infer that permeability changes during creep are a result of the competing processes of dissolution, precipitation and dilatant microcracking. Depending upon deformation rates, this could have ramifications which are beneficial for waste isolation, but deleterious for geothermal energy extraction schemes.","","","Geophysics Group, Los Alamos National Laboratory, Los Alamos, New Alamos, New Mexico","","","United States","1984-10-01T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: Geophys.

The potential for unacceptable fluid temperature decline at production wells as a consequence of large-scale injection is of obvious concern to geothermal developers, and methods are needed for evaluating the thermal response of these ''fast paths'' to injection. One difficulty encountered in analyzing test data is that the geometry of the flow path(s) may be speculative and ambiguous, leading to unreliable predictions of thermal interference. Fast pathways often may be provided by major vertical or nearly vertical fractures and faults with approximately linear flow geometry. This paper discusses possibilities for characterizing the thermal properties of fast paths by means of different types of tests (tracers, pressure transients, nonisothermal injection). Thermal breakthrough in vertical fractures is examined in some detail by using an idealized model for which an analytical solution is available. The model shows that rapid tracer returns are not necessarily indicative of rapid thermal interference. Thermal breakthrough predictions can be made from tracer data only, if both fluid residence time and tracer dispersion are taken into account. However, because of the geometric simplifications necessary in analyzing the tracer data, thermal interference estimates on this basis appear questionable. Pressure transient tests can provide additional parameters for thermal interference predictions, but they cannot resolve the problem of nonuniqueness. A more reliable determination of thermal characteristics of fast paths appears possible from nonisothermal injection tests, combined with numerical simulation.","","","Lawrence Berkeley Laboratory","","","United States","1984-09-01T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: J.

The changes may be caused, in part, by changes in surface free energy. Experimental fracture surface energies of quartz range from about 400 mJ m/sup -2/ to about 11.5 J m/sup -2/. Thermodynamic surface free energies are likely to be lower than fracture surface energies owing to dissipative energy losses and failure to achieve equilibrium surface structure. Thermodynamic surface free energies are sensitive to environmental composition. Reaction of water vapor with pristine fracture surfaces reduces surface energy by hydroxylation, but the extent of reduction is not known. Adsorption of water vapor on the hydroxylated surface and immmersion in liquid water reduce surface energy by 75--230 and 72 mJ m/sup -2/ respectively. In an electrolyte, the surface energy by 75--230 and 72 mJ m/sup -2/ respectively. In an electrolyte, the surface free energy is maximum at the point of zero charge, where adsorption of ionic solutes is least. Adsorption of hydrogen ion, hydroxide ion, and electrolytes reduce surface energy as concentration increases, by tens of mJ m/sup -2/.

Yielding and flow in all crystals below their respective critical weakening temperatures appear to be controlled by a lattice resistance mechanisms, characterized by a low activation energy and very small activation area. Above the critical temperatures, it appears that crystal flow is facilitated by diffusion of ''water,'' or some related hydroxy defect, to the dislocations, causing hydrolysis of the strong Si-O-Si bonds and aiding bond exchange. This process may assist glide or climb of dislocations-or both-and appears to be rate-limiting. There is evidence that hydrolytic weakening is strongly influenced by confining pressure, possibly through the solubility or diffusivity of H/sub 2/O or its components in quartz.","","","Geophysics Group, Los Alamos National Laboratory","","","United States","1984-06-10T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: J.

In the beta field, between 700/sup 0/ and 850/sup 0/C, the data are represented by two linear Arrhenius relations for transport parallel and perpendicular to c. Values for D/sub 0/ (m/sup 2/ s/sup -1/) are 2.09 x 10/sup -11/ parallel to c and 3.16 x 10/sup -10/ perpendicular to (1010).

At 700/sup 0/C, in the total pressure range 11.5--100 MPa, D/sub o/x is independent of water (f(H/sub 2/O)) and oxygen (f(O/sub 2/)) fugacities between the Ni--NiO and Fe/sub 3/O/sub 4/--Fe/sub 2/O/sub 3/ buffers. The results are consistent with diffusion via a simple charged vacancy mechanism under an extrinsic point defect regime. Further experiments are required to confirm the nature of the mobile oxygen defect.. A key aspect of the results is the observation that at the low water fugacities of the present experiments a hydrogen-containing defect appears to play no role in the oxygen transport mechanism. This is in contrast to other published sets of data and leads directly to the requirement for detailed interlaboratory comparisons.","","","Department of Geology, Imperial College","","","United States","1984-06-10T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: J.

The bulk rock chemistry buffers the fugacity of oxygen, which in turn fixes the fugacities of water and of hydrogen for a given pressure and temperature. Systems in which only water, oxygen, and hydrogen are present as fluid phases are considered here. Variations in the fugacity of oxygen by several orders of magnitude are possible locally, controlled by variations in local rock chemistry; these lead to relative small variations in the fugacity of water. Incorporation of a hydrogen defect that is capable of acting as an acceptor into silicates leads to a strong dependence of point defect chemistry upon the fugacities of both water and oxygen. The strong dependence on the fugacity of water is capable of explaining the hydrolytic weakening effect, but in view of the strong dependence on oxygen fugacity, the question should also be raised whether it is an oxygen effect that is in the classical hydrolytic weakening process or solely a dependence on changes in the fugacity of water. Examples are given for impure natural quartz, olivine, and albite with trace amounts of calcium.","","","Department of Earth Sciences, Monash University","","","United States","1984-06-10T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: J.

Some samples were dried by vacuum heating, others were left as is, and others had 0.1--0.5 wt % water added to them before being mechanically sealed in a Pt tube and deformed. When the creep data are fit to a power law form of flow law, they show, with increasing water available, a decrease in the activation energy from 44 to 41 to 35 kcal/mol, and a decrease in the stress exponent from 3.3 to 2.3 to 1.8. Samples deformed at 900 /sup 0/C and 10/sup -6//s showed corresponding changes in preferred orientations from a diffuse maximum parallel to a small circle girdle about sigma/sub 1/ and a change in deformation lamellae orientations from basal to basal plus prismatic. The samples also showed corresponding textural changes, from little recovery and no recrystallization, to greater recovery with moderate amounts of fine grain boundary recrystallization and small isolated melt pockets (<1 vol%), to even greater recovery with less continuous but coarser recrystallization and somewhat more extensive grain boundary melt (<3 vol%). The low stress exponent of the water added samples may be due to a component of grain boundary sliding, allowed by the grain boundary recrystallization and melt in these samples, but there is not microstructural evidence for such a mechanism. The change is slip systems of the original grains in the water added samples might be due in part to some relaxation of grain boundary constraints.","","","Department of Geological Sciences, Brown University","","","United States","1984-06-10T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: J.

The amount of water available to the samples was varied so that flow strengths for the entire suite of samples could be compared at several, nominally equal water concentrations; samples were vacuum dried at 800 /sup 0/C for 12 hours, left as is, or sealed in Pt jackets with 0.03--0.4 wt % water added.

Although grain boundary-dislocation interactions may lead to grain boundary hardening and grain boundary sliding to weakening the details of the mechanical data, in combination with microstructural observations, are inconsistent with existing models of intrinsic grain boundary effects.","","","Department of Geological Sciences, Brown University","","","United States","1984-06-10T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: J.

In both cases the stress-strain curves are substantially higher than would be expected on the basis of the strength of hydrolytically weakened synthetic crystals containing less ''water'' than the rocks, as measured by the broad infrared absorption at low temperature. Thus, would appear that, relative to the single crystals, the ''effective'' concentration of the water-related species that is active in mechanical weakening within the grains is only a small fraction of the ''water'' present. The presence of glass in the grain boundaries of ''wet'' deformed specimens suggest that grain boundary weakening may also be significant in these experiments.

Differential vapor pressure measurements made using a strain-gauge transducer proved to be rapid and accurate. The vapor pressures were converted to osmotic coefficients, and these osmotic coefficients were fit to both the Lietzke-Stoughton and Pitzer equations. Parameters for these salts and others (NaBr, NaI, NaHS, KBr, KI, LiCl, LiBr, and LiI), for which literature data exist, were tabulated. Many of the trends in the calculated activity coefficients can be correlated with respect to the effect of the ions on the structure of the water. A simple model is presented that factors the activity coefficient into three parts corresponding to long-range electrostatic ion-ion interactions, hydration, and association: this reproduces experimental values with reasonable accuracy. The authors demonstrate a correlation between the ionic potential ratio, (Z/sub c//r/sub c/)/(Z/sub a//r/sub a/), and the activity coefficient, which corresponds physical to the structure-making/breaking correlation. The model has been applied qualitatively to the high temperature data obtained here. The model has also been used to reevaluate the MacInnes convention as a means of obtaining single-ion activity coefficients.","","","Princeton Univ., NJ","","","United States","1984-06-01T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: Am.

A study of the difficulties that Union was encountering in developing the expected steam from its new production wells is presented. The Baca Reservoir Definition Review Team closely followed activities until the principal parties mutually agreed in January 1982 to terminate the project. The review team issued its final report later that year. In contrast to the negative outcome of the project, the less newsworthy but beneficial scientific aspects of the project may have been largely ignored except by interested specialists in industry and research.

The extraction of usable energy from a HDR reservoir made by hydraulically fracturing the hot, but essentially dry rock between two deep drill holes has been successfully demonstrated at Fenton Hill, New Mexico by the Los Alamos National Laboratory. Depending on the location and depth of future HDR reservoirs, the extracted heat may be either high grade (for generation of electricity), or low grade (for direct-use space heating, food processing, etc.). The circulating hot water can also be used to augment energy production from other energy systems such as boiler feedwater preheat, process heat for synfuel production, or stimulating bacteria growth in cold climates (for instance, more rapid digestion in sewage treatment plants or landfill dumps). When the HDR technology of drilling and fracturing in crystalline rock is coupled with solar energy production, excess summertime heat from solar collection facilities can be transferred and stored in manmade underground reservoirs for wintertime withdrawal and utilization. The same technology can provide huge, but easily accessible, heat sinks for reject industrial heat, creating many options for industry, municipalities, and district heating organizations to integrate energy demands with heat disposal requirements.","","","Los Alamos National Laboratory, Los Alamos, NM","","","United States","1984-06-01T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: J.

It trends N52/sup 0/E and is >500 km in length. Previous investigators suggest the zone is associated with elevated heat flow and anomalously low P wave velocity from 25 to 140 km depth measured along a line from Mount Taylor to the Jemez Mountains. It may also be associated with a Precambrian crustal-age boundary. A detailed study, consisting of 119 audiomagnetotelluric (AMT) and 25 magnetotelluric (MT) soundings, was performed in a 161 km/sup 2/ area located approx.50 km NW of the zone center. The AMT soundings were spaced 1.6 km apart in a grid pattern and had a frequency range from 12 Hz to 10.2 kHz. The AMT soundings were used to detect any near-surface electrical structures or lateral variations. None were found, although terrain effects near the edges of mesas were observed. Agreement between the AMT and MT results from 12 to 50 Hz was excellent. Electrical strike direction is undefined at less than 1-s period. From 1 to 100 s the average tipper strike is N30/sup 0/W, aligning with the dominant surface structures. Greater than 100 s, it rotates abruptly to approx.N60/sup 0/N. This direction represents the electrical strike within metamorphic Precambrian basement rocks and suggests control of the deep electrical structure beneath the study area by the Jemez zone. Two-dimensional MT modeling indicates three relatively homogeneous layers. The resistivity of the deepest layer, > or =15 km depth, is 50 ohm-m in the northwest but decreases to 5 ohm-m southeastward, toward the zone.","","","Geophysics Group, Earth and Space Sciences Division, Los Alamos National Laboratory","","","United States","1984-05-10T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: J.

Tests are described with a full-scale system operating on a geothermal resource in south western Utah. The tasks were sponsored by the Utah Power and Light Company and the Electric Power Research Institute. Tests demonstrated the production of powers up to 1 MW. The power was supplied to the UP and L utility grid. The rotary-separator turbine steam-output of flow represents an additional power production capability of 4.72 MW. This is a total output of 5.72 MW, which is 17% greater than the output from an optimized single-stage flash-steam plant. A complete wellhead power-plant design was prepared, defining a system with a 10 MW output. the RST wellhead power plant is designed as a modular system, to minimize field-construction activities. The wellhead power-plant design offers revenue production within two years, compared to three to five years for conventional central plants. A geothermal rotary-separator turbine was designed and operated on a geothermal resource as a wellhead powerplant. It was the first operation of a RST wellhead system producing commercial power from a liquid-dominated resource. Power production above one megawatt was demonstrated. The tests demonstrated reliable operation for 600 hours, with a 20 percent power addition to the output of a singlestage flash-steam system. These favorable results and greater performance advantages calculated for a wellhead unit led to the design of a 10-megawatt wellhead power plant incorporating the rotary-separator turbine.","","","","","","United States","1984-05-01T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: Geotherm.

Submersibles are necessary if the lift is high, say 240 m (300 ft) or more. If a turbine pump can be used, a variable speed driver should be considered. These drivers permit no load starting, reduce shock and vibration, and minimize horsepower requirements. In the range of flow between 20 % and 60% of design, the power savings is about 40% when compared to regulating flow by throtting. Plate heat exchangers are less expensive and more effective than tube heat exchangers in the usual geothermal applications. They can be used as the key component in a two loop system to minimize the effect of corrosion and deposits. Many types of nonmetallic pipes are available that are suitable for geothermal service. Limiting consideration for each type is the geothermal water temperature. Burying a pipeline achieves an insulating effect. This can be improved by selective backfilling, and of course, use of insulated pipe. In addition to economic considerations, the minimum acceptable delivered water temperature must be considered. Delivered water temperatures drop drastically at low flows. Space heating can be accomplished using geothermal water as low as 29.4/sup 0/C (85/sup 0/F). Methods used are dependent on the temperature of the water available. Finned tubes in forced air ducting are a very effective method of heating, using water as low as 40.6/sup 0/C (105/sup 0/F), achieving approach to room temperature of 5.6/sup 0/C (10/sup 0/ F) with the discharge water.","","","","","","United States","1984-05-01T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: Geotherm.

During the construction of its geothermal power plants, NCPA incurred significant capital costs for power plant equipment. From experience gained on its first geothermal plant, NCPA has been able to refine the economic analysis for awarding contracts on the major items of power plant equipment. This experience shows that the method of analysis used can have a significant impact on annual power plant operating costs. The major pieces of power plant equipment for which the economic analysis has been done are: turbine generators, circulating water pumps, condensate pumps, and cooling towers. Certain types of power plant equipment have significant capital costs, but very low operating costs. Examples of this type of equipment are: piping, valves and major electrical equipment such as transformers and switch gear. For equipment of this type, the purchase decision is relatively easy and based simply on the lowest price which meets the technical specification requirements. However, for equipment with significant operating costs, the lowest priced equipment is not necessarily the most cost-effective equipment. Spending money up front through the design and procurement process can significantly decrease operating costs. The effects of these decisions on power plant operating costs are discussed.","","","Northern California Power Agency, Citrus Heights","","","United States","1984-05-01T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: Bull., Geotherm.

One of the large cost factors in pressure piping is the friction factor of the pipe interior. Economical pipe selection demands that the effects of friction be considered. Smooth-bores such as found in glass-reinforced thermosetting resin (RTR) have demonstrated very good flow characteristics. Tests have shown a Hazen-Williams C factor of 150. New carbon steel is quite smooth also, but when carrying water or other common fluids, corrosion roughens the surface, sometimes almost closing up the pipe. So when the system is designed, this increased friction must be taken into account. Power supply, pumps and piping diameters must be chosen to function even when the flow is restricted. The fact is, systems are often designed for steel even though a different piping material is eventually selected. This is a temptation because much of the experience in sizing pipe are all more or less based on steel. Even a recent book dealing with the economic sizing of pipe bases its premise on an average friction factor. Smoothness of pipe bore and the retention of that smoothness over the years makes a difference. The use of smooth-bore piping to reduce friction is discussed.","","","Ameron, Brea, CA","","","United States","1984-05-01T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: Bull., Geotherm.

This work considers the inherent problems in such operations as the storage of hot or cold fluids in caverns and aquifers, underground storage of nuclear waste, underground recovery of heat from hydrocarbon fuels, tertiary recovery of oil by thermal methods, rapid excavation of large openings at shallow to great depths and in hostile environments, and retrofitting of large structures built on or in rock. The standardization of methods for determining rock properties is essential to all of the activities described, for use not only in design and construction but also in site selection and post-construction monitoring.

Analysis of the geothermal reservoir either under natural conditions or subject to proposed development should account for the mass (water) and energy (heat) balances of adjacent aquifers as well as the reservoir itself. A three-dimensional model based on finite difference approximation is applied to this integrated system. The model simulates heat transport associated with the flow of steam and water through an equivalent porous medium. The Baca geothermal reservoir is dominated by flow in fractures and distinct strata, but at the scale of application the equivalent porous media concept is appropriate. The geothermal reservoir and adjacent aquifers are simulated under both natural conditions and proposed production strategies. Simulation of natural conditions compares favorably with observed pressure, temperature, and thermal discharge data. The history matching simulations show that the results used for comparison are most sensitive to vertical permeability and the area of an assumed high-permeability zone connecting the reservoir to a deep hydrothermal source. Simulations using proposed production strategies and optimistic estimates of certain hydrologic parameters and reservoir extent indicate that a 50-MW power plant could be maintained for a period greater than 30 years. This production, however, will result in significant decreases in the total water discharge to the Jemez River.","","","GeoTrans, Inc., Reston, VA","","","United States","1984-05-01T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: Water Resour.

The maximum temperature measured was 265C at the bottom of the hole, 932 m below the surface. Rocks recovered fr9om the drill hole are divided into three intervals on the basis of hydrothermal alteration and mineral deposition: (1) 0-290 m consists of unaltered, largely glassy volcanic material, with present temperatures ranging from 20 to 40C; (2) 290-700 m consists of permeable tuff layers, tuff breccia units, and brecciated and fractured rhyodacitic to dacitic lava flows, with temperatures ranging from 40 to 100C; (3) 700-932 m consists of impermeable andesitic to basaltic lava flows that generally show little effect of alteration, interlayered with permeable hydrothermally altered flow breccia, with temperatures gradually increasing from 100 at 700 m to 265C at 932 m. Hydrothermal alteration throughout the system is controlled by rock permeability, temperature, composition of geothermal fluids, and composition and crystallinity of host rocks. Rock alteration consists mainly of replacement of glass by clay minerals and, locally, zeolites, partial replacement of plagioclase phenocrysts by calcite +/- epidote +/- illite, and whole-rock leaching adjacent to fluids channels. Open-space deposition of hydrothermal minerals in fractures, vesicles, and interbreccia pore space is far more abundant than replacement. A cooling shallow convection system in the upper 700 m is indicated by the occurrence of hydrothermal minerals that were deposited in a slightly higher temperature environment than presently exists. Below 700 m, the heat flow is conductive, and fluid flow is controlled by horizontal lava flows. Homogenization temperatures of secondary quartz fluid inclusions were as high as 370C.","","","Geological Survey, Menlo Park, CA","","","United States","1984-04-01T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: Bull., Geotherm.

Thus, casing is a major initial well cost. The designs of the casing strings are, therefore, critical elements for the economics of a geothermal project. A failure of the casing string often leads to loss of the well, or at least, a major expense for repair to reestablish safe production. One type of complex geothermal well profile for a high temperature, scaling and corrosive reservoir is presented. This is the first of five short articles about the design of casing for geothermal wells. Only casing design considerations unique to geothermal are presented along with some methods which can be used to overcome problem areas.

On the other hand, the maximum reservoir temperatures of very active systems in the world increase with the increasing depth of the reservoir nearly along the boiling curve of water when the water table is set at the surface.

Because the gravitational influence of celestial objects occurs over large areas of the earth, the confined aquifer is assumed to respond in an undrained fashion. Since undrained response is controlled by water compressibility, earth tide response can be directly used only to evaluate porous medium compressibility if porosity is known. Moreover, since specific storage S/sub s/ quantifies a drained behavior of the porous medium, one cannot directly estimate S/sub s/from earth tide response. Except for the fact that barometric changes act both on the water surface in the well and on the aquifer as a whole while stress changes associated with earth tides act only in the aquifer, the two phenomena influence the confined aquifer in much the same way. In other words, barometric response contains only as much information on the elastic properties of the aquifer as the earth tide response does. Factors such as well bore storage, aquifer transmissivity, and storage coefficient contribute to time lag and damping of the aquifer response as observed in the well. Analysis shows that the observation of fluid pressure changes alone, without concurrent measurement of external stress changes, is sufficient to interpret uniquely earth tide response. In the present work, change in external stress is estimated from dilatation by assuming a reasonable value for bulk modulus. Earth tide response of geothermal aquifers from Marysville, Montana. East Mesa, California; and Raft River Valley, Idaho, were analyzed, and the ratio of S/sub 3/ to porosity was estimated. Comparison of these estimates with independent pumping tests show reasonable agreement.","","","Earth Sciences Division, Lawrence Berkeley Laboratory","","","United States","1984-03-10T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: J.

There is no need to wait for the development of direct-use geothermal technology. It has been on-line, tried and proven, since the turn of the century. Nearly all the equipment required for direct-use geothermal systems has been available for decades as off-the-shelf items. The only remaining question for direct-use geothermal development is the economic feasibility of the proposed direct-use system. If the resource is proven and the proposed end use is compatible with the temperature and flow rate of the resource, the only element left for consideration is the economic viability of the project. That is, will the system create sufficient benefits, savings, or revenues to justify the amount of capital investment necessary to bring it on-line. Life-cycle cost analysis is the method generally used to determine economic feasibility. This paper will acquaint the reader with the basic principles of this analysis. Life-cycle costing combines all the techniques of projecting and evaluating total system costs over the expected life of the system. These costs include capital investment, annual costs of operating and maintaining the system, financing costs, taxes and insurance, etc. associated with the system. The end result of all these cost projections is to evaluate the ratio of the annual benefit (revenue or savings) to the cost or required capital investment to determine if the project is worthwhile. Once life-cycle costs have been calculated it is easy to determine the present worth of these cash flows, the internal rate of return on invested capital, and the payback period.","","","Geo-Heat Center, Oregon Institute of Technology","","","United States","1984-03-01T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: Geotherm.

Both vapor compression and absorption refrigeration cycles accomplish the removal of heat through the evaporation of a refrigerant at a low pressure and the rejection of heat through the condensation of the refrigerant at a higher pressure. The method of creating the pressure difference and circulating the refrigerant is the primary difference between the two cycles. The vapor compression cycle employs a mechanical compressor to create the pressure differences necessary to circulate the refrigerant. In the absorption system, a secondary fluid or absorbent is used to circulate the refrigerant. Since the temperature requirements for the cycle fall into the low- to moderatetemperature range, and there is significant potential for electrical energy savings, absorption would seem to be a good prospect for geothermal application. Absorption machines are commercially available today in two basic configurations. For applications above 0.0 C (32 F) (primarily air conditioning), the cycle uses lithium bromide as the absorbent and water as the refrigerant. For applications below 0.0 C (32 F) an ammonia/ water cycle is employed with ammonia as the refrigerant and water as the absorbent. This article concentrates on the lithium bromide/water cycle, explaining the basic cycle and offering some considerations with regard to geothermal applications.","","","Geo-Heat Center, OIT, Klamath Falls, Oregon","","","United States","1984-03-01T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: Geotherm.

Measurements included soil temperatures, apparent electrical conductivity of the soil, electrical conductivity and temperature in the Pilgrim River, saturated hydraulic conductivity of the soil and ground water flow characteristics (direction and velocity). In addition the size, number and characteristics (geometry, direction of flow) of nearsurface convective plumes were investigated. Measured temperature profiles were used to estimate ground water flow velocities. There are approximately 2-3 km/sup 2/ of thawed ground surrounded by permafrost on the order of 100m in thickness. The highest temperatures were found in the southwest quadrant of the thawed area where a pool of ground water at approx. = 92/sup 0/C exists at 14-32 m below the ground surface. Temperature measurements suggest that water in the pool is flowing laterally and vertically. Temperature and electrical conductivity measurements suggest that this pool of water underlies most of the thawed ground area although the possibility of several, unconnected sources of hot water and multiple pools has not been ruled out. Conductivity measurements suggest that hot and/or saline water rises in convective plumes from the pool at about 40-60 sites. The Pilgrim River appears to be heated by heat transfer from the geothermal area. Saline ground water enters the Pilgrim River, probably through its bed, increasing the conductivity of the river water.","","","Geophysical Institute, University of Alaska, Fairbanks, Alaska","","","United States","1984-03-01T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: J.

Foraging vent abalones actively consume the bacteria and confine their nightly feeding forays to bacterial mats surrounding the vents. The growth of abalones consuming the sulfur bacteria exceeds that of control individuals consuming microalgae and is comparable to reported growth rates of abalones consuming macroalgae. Thus, off White Point, the black abalone may derive a portion of its nutrition from the subsidy of geothermal energy.","","","California State Univ., Long Beach","","","United States","1984-02-17T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: Science (Washington, D.C.); (United States); Journal Volume: 223","","Medium: X; Size: Pages: 696-698","","","","Journal ID: CODEN: SCIEA","10.1126/science.223.4637.696","","2016-04-13T00:00:00Z","6165743","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/6165743","","Science (Washington, D.C.); (United States)","","223"

Only about 0.5% of the earth's geothermal reserve can be brought to the surface as dry steam. California's Imperial Valley is possibly the largest geothermal resource in the US. Three demonstration generating plants are each producing between 10 and 14 MW of power near the valley's Salton Sea. The high-temperature water (above 410/sup 0/F) at Brawley is drawn from wells tapping the subterranean reservoir. It is proposed that hot-water power will be economical when methods are found to extract maximum energy from a geothermal deposit and to control clogging and corrosion caused by minerals dissolved in the hot fluid.","","","","","","United States","1984-02-01T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: Geotherm.

Currently, 18 power plants use steam from the earth to produce over 1,200 megawatts of electricity, enough power to serve 1.2 million people. Eight additional plants under construction will add almost 600 megawatts. All of this energy development is occurring in the rugged terrain known as the Geysers-Calistoga Known Geothermal Resource Area, in Lake and Sonoma counties. Although all power plant development causes some type of environmental impact, geothermal power plants cause fewer impacts than many types of power plants and offer substantial benefits. As a result, the California Energy Commission encourages the development of geothermal energy when done in an environmentally acceptable manner. If the environmental impacts are resolved and adequate steam resources can be tapped, the Geysers may eventually provide 3,000 megawatts or more of power--a major contribution to California's energy future.","","","","","","United States","1984-02-01T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: Geotherm.

An example of such a technique uses Schatz, Kasameyer, and Cheney's depth-porosity model. Their depth-porosity model for reservoir compaction is modified in the present paper and is combined with a modified form of Geertsma's nucleus of strain model to form a single predictive technique. The nucleus of strain model accounts for attenuation of vertical movement through the overburden. Based on this combined model, prediction of ultimate vertical subsidence are made at eleven specified locations. At five of these sites in California, Texas, and New Zealand, these predictions are compared to measured subsidence. Agreement between predicted and observed subsidence is good. If field measurements of water-level fluctuations and the resulting time-dependent compression and expansion of geologic strata are locally available, use of a more refined predictive technique is justified. Tolman and Poland's conceptual model and Riley's parameter evaluation method have been combined with Helm's one-dimensional finite difference computational scheme to form a powerful time-dependent predictive technique. This technique has been field verified successfully at more than two dozen sites in California and Texas. Use of such a computer code allows prediction of observed time lags in nonlinear compression and expansion of layered sedimentary materials in response to arbitrary sequences of rising and falling water levels. 79 references, 22 figures, 4 tables.","","","Lawrence Livermore National Lab., CA","","","United States","1984-01-01T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: Geol.

Lying within a belt of major thermal anomalies, it has within its boundaries the Moana Hot Springs geothermal reservoir and probably other reservoirs, and only 14 km to the south is the major reservoir at Steamboat Hot Springs. This paper discusses the alternative heat sources that can be used, and selects Steamboat as the most conservative choice for a ''worst-case'' analysis of the details and economics of a model district heating system. A closed 16 km transmission loop between Steamboat and downtown Reno is envisaged, carrying 121/sup 0/C water in the supply line and 65/sup 0/C in the return line. This loop is isolated by heat exchangers from both the 176/sup 0/C geothermal fluids at the Steamboat end of the line, and from the Reno user systems at the other. Detailed analysis of thermal demand densities in different parts of the City led to a model distribution network 48 km long, that serves the optimum grouping of zones of concentrated heat users.

Higher concentration of radon observed at wells with higher fluid enthalpy can be attributed to the higher steam fraction in the reservoir fluid. Regression analysis of radon concentration with specific volume of pore fluid shows a significant degree of correlation, resulting from the dependence of specific volume on both two-phase conditions and reservoir temperature. Temporal variations in radon concentration reflect changing phase conditions in the reservoir. Observations over a 2-year interval show significant changes in the producing zones. The constant low concentration along the western edge of the field indicates a fluid of low steam saturation. In the eastern area, radon concentrations have increased significantly suggesting an increase in the steam saturation in this part of the reservoir due to exploitation. Other areas, e.g. the southeast area, show decreased radon concentration indicating a decrease in steam saturation. Concurrent measurements of ammonia, a soluble component of the noncondensable gases, support the observations of partitioning of gas components, with wellhead concentration dependent on spatial variations in steam saturation over the field.","","","Stanford Univ., Stanford, CA","","","United States","1984-01-01T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: Geothermics; (United States); Journal Volume: 13:1","","Medium: X; Size: Pages: 103-115","","","","Journal ID: CODEN: GTMCA","10.1016/0375-6505(84)90010-5","","2016-04-29T00:00:00Z","6239998","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/6239998","","Geothermics; (United States)","","13:1"

The precision of the most recent measurements (November, 1981) averages about 1%. Results from 2.5 years of monitoring indicate a 5% annual increase in apparent resistivity over the present production area and decreases in apparent resistivity of the same magnitude in the regions immediately eastward and westward from the production zone. The increase in resistivity in the production zone is most likely due to dilution of reservoir fluids with fresher water, as evidenced by a drop in chloride content of produced waters. An attempt was made to determine whether specific lithologic zones in wellbores show resistivity changes with time by comparing well logs from newly drilled wells with logs from older nearby wells. Results show that lateral resistivity variations within stratigraphic units between closely-spaced wells are sufficient to obscure possible temporal changes.

The heat in storage in that part of the reservoir hotter than 200/sup 0/C and shallower than 3 km depth is equivalent to that which would be released by the cooling of about 1 or 2 km/sup 3/ of basalt or gabbro magma.","","","Inst. of Geophysics, Univ. of California, Riverside, CA","","","United States","1984-01-01T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: Geothermics; (United States); Journal Volume: 13:1","","Medium: X; Size: Pages: 27-47","","","","Journal ID: CODEN: GTMCA","10.1016/0375-6505(84)90005-1","","2016-05-09T00:00:00Z","6240083","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/6240083","","Geothermics; (United States)","","13:1"

This suspicion was reinforced after several deep geothermal wells, drilled to depths of 3-3.5 km over the anomaly, intersected an apparent dike-sill complex consisting mainly of diabase but with minor rhyodacite. A detailed fit of the observed magnetic field to a computer model indicates that the source may be approximated by a tabular block 4 x 6 km in area, 3.7 km in depth, 2.3 km thick, and dipping slightly to the north. Mafic dike chips from one well, NL-1, were analysed by means of electron microprobe analyses which showed them to contain a titanomagnetite that is paramagnetic at in situ temperature conditions. As the dike mineralogy does not account for the magnetic anomaly, the magnetic source is believed to be a deeper, magnetite-rich assemblage of peridotite-gabbro plutons. The suite of igneous rocks was probably emplaced at a shallow depth in response to crustal extension and thinning brought on by en echelon strike-slip faulting. The bottom of the magnetic source body, at an estimated depth of 6 km, is presumed to be at or near that of the Curie isotherm (575/sup 0/C) for magnetite, the principal ferromagnetic mineral in peridotiticgabbroic rocks. The geological model derived from the magnetic study is generally supported by other geophysical data. In particular, earthquake data suggest dike injection is occurring at depths of 6-11 km in an area beneath the magnetic source. Thus, it is possible that heat for the geothermal field is being maintained by continuing crustal extension and magmatic activity.","","","Lawrence Berkeley Lab., Univ. of California, Berkeley, CA","","","United States","1984-01-01T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: Geothermics; (United States); Journal Volume: 13:1","","Medium: X; Size: Pages: 3-11","","","","Journal ID: CODEN: GTMCA","10.1016/0375-6505(84)90003-8","","2016-05-13T00:00:00Z","6377299","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/6377299","","Geothermics; (United States)","","13:1"

Earthquake swarms, a magnetic anomaly, and aspects of the gravity anomaly are all indirect evidence for the igneous activity which is the ultimate source of heat for the system. Heat is transferred from this area of intrusion by lateral spreading of hot water in a reservoir beneath an impermeable cap rock. A two dimensional analytic model encompassing this transport mechanism matches general features of the thermal anomaly and has been used to estimate the age of the presently observed thermal system. The age is calculated by minimizing the variance between the observed surface heat-flow data and the model. Estimates of the system age for this model range from 3,000 to 20,000 years.","","","Lawrence Livermore National Lab.

Scale control is a combination of measures to inhibit and remove scale. At some time the laboratory should become self-supporting, commercial in its own right, or the prototype for one or more similar units.

The fault plane solution for the lower reservoir indicates strike slip, either left lateral strike slip on a N-S vertical plane or right lateral slip on an E-W vertical plane. In contrast, the solution for the upper zone includes largely vertical slip on the N-S nearly vertical plane, or oblique slip on a nearly horizontal plane. Because the N-S nodal plane is common in both solutions we infer that this represents the true fracture plane. Faulting thus seems to occur on a series of parallel faults or joints that intersect both reservoirs but a change in the slip vector indicates a major change in the state of stress between the upper and lower reservoirs. This latter conclusion is surprising because the two reservoirs are separated by less than 1 km. We suggest that this rapid change in the stress field may be related to the structure and subsidence of the nearby Valles Caldera.","","","Earth and Space Sciences Division, Los Alamos National Laboratory, Los Alamos, New Mexico 87545","","","United States","1983-12-01T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: Geophys.

These studies encompass the complete energy delivery system, from reservoir simulation to surface plant performance, and the results have been developed in parametric form so that important physical limitations and economic compromises can be identified. Geopressured fluids contain three forms of energy: hydraulic, thermal and chemical (due to dissolved methane). The present paper presents typical results for wellbore flow characteristics along with performance of surface plants for conversion of thermal and hydraulic energy components. Thermal recovery plants are expected to employ either direct flash or organic Rankine cycle units; results from both configurations are presented. In addition, performance results for two organic working fluids are given. The extreme importance of gas recovery from geopressured fluids is also illustrated. Even partial recovery of dissolved gas may provide an energy output which is equivalent to the combined thermal and hydraulic components. Conversely, it seems unwise to discard all thermal and hydraulic energy and employ a geopressured fluid as solely a carrier for dissolved methane.","","","","","","United States","1983-11-01T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: Geotherm.

In Boise, Idaho's capitol city, all the right elements were there. A new geothermal system began operating in October 1982, providing space and hot water heating for Idaho's Capitol Mall complex, which has nearly 750,000 sq ft of space in seven buildings. It is the culmination of work begun in 1975 with a demonstration project in the State's Agriculture/Health Building--a demonstration which proved the economics of geothermal heating and served as a testing ground for applications of equipment, materials, and methods of controlling and conserving the resource. The Capitol Mall system is exceeding initial expectations, providing over 95 percent of the heating load on a 10 F day. The geothermal system has resulted in energy savings of approximately $120,000 on the costs of natural gas for the first 1982-83 heating season.

Such a situation may exist as a result of formation of a burned zone in in-situ combustion, by phase change in a steam flood or geothermal operation, or simply by the formation of a bank of injected fluid with properties different from those of the reservoir fluid. The spherical configuration is expected to represent geothermal applications more closely than does a radial configuration, and is also of interest in hydrocarbon wells with limited entry or partial penetration, or those wells in the vicinity of a pinchout. The problem is solved analytically by using the Laplace transform, which is then inverted using the Stehfest algorithm. The solution is different in detail from the radial case but still shows the important pseudosteady-state behavior at the end of the inner region response (in some cases).

Comparison of the model results with previous work shows this model to be more conservative. The equations developed are simple enough to be used in hand calculations, but the full capability of the model is more easily obtained with a computer program. Studies with the model show that volume requirements and standpipe pressures are significantly different for mist drilling compared with air drilling. An improved method for calculating downhole temperatures, pressures, fluid densities, and velocities during air drilling has been developed. Improvements on previous methods include the following. A fully transient thermal analysis of the wellbore and formation is used to determine the flowing temperatures. The effects of flow acceleration are included explicitly in the calculation. The slip velocity between the gas and the cuttings is determined by the use of a separate momentum equation for the cuttings. The possibility of critical flow in the wellbore is tested and appropriate changes in the volume flow rate and standpipe pressure are made automatically. The standpipe and flowing pressures are predicted. The analysis is conservative. The effect of the cuttings on the wellbore flow will tend to overpredict the required volume flow rates. In this paper, the basic equations of fluid flow for a gas with cuttings and mist are presented along with a numerical method for their solution. Several applications of this calculational method are given, showing the effect of flow rate and standpipe pressure in typical air and mist drilling situations.","","","Enertech Engineering and Research Co.","","","United States","1983-11-01T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: J.

It is shown that a fault can keep fluid if there exists a spatially fluctuating tectonic stress field superimposed on the linear depth-dependent stress field, although the fluctuation amplitude must be larger than a lower limit when the fault is oblique. It is also revealed that except for the case of a horizontal fault, there is an upper limit for the size of the fluid-filled region even if the fluctuating stress field is spatially periodic. As the fluid-filled region is created, slip spreads simultaneously along the fault. This resulting slip is also analyzed.","","","Department of Mechanical Engineering, Tohoku University","","","United States","1983-10-10T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: J.

The number of wells drilled decreased from a record 486 in 1981 to 475 in 1982; however, the total footage drilled increased from 2,711,217 ft in 1981 to 2,910,277 ft in 1982, and the average footage per well jumped sharply from 5,579 to 6,127 ft. In addition, 2,062 development wells were drilled (97.4% successfully). At various times during the year, up to 10 drilling vessels were active in state and federal waters. Four new offshore discoveries were announced by Texaco, Atlantic Richfield, Oxy, and Union. Texaco's ''Hueso'' discovery is a probable extension of the Chevron-Phillips Point Arguello field announced in October 1981. The field is believed to be a giant oil field containing over 100 million bbl of recoverable reserves. Union, Oxy, and Atlantic Richfield struck oil in the fractured Monterey Shale. Further delineation drilling will be needed to determine field reserves. California's total oil production for 1982 was 401.4 million bbl, a 4% increase from the 1981 record of 385 million bbl. Five unsuccesful wildcats were abandoned in Washington. Although there were some encouraging shows, the accumulations were deemed noncommercial. The bulk of drilling activity in Oregon centered around the Mist gas field. There were no discoveries announced for 1982.

The presence of noncondensable gases in the steam causes a loss in the net power produced from that steam. Two of the gases, carbon dioxide (CO/sub 2/) and hydrogen sulfide (H/sub 2/S), give the steam and the condensate a corrosive potential; H/sub 2/S may present an emission control problem. EPRI has concentrated its efforts on the removal of these noncondensable gases upstream of the power plant and has developed and tested a process for this purpose. This approach is expected to reduce corrosion, improve turbine performance, and simplify H/sub 2/S emission control. Preparations are being made for further tests over a wide range of steam conditions. The methods currently used to control H/sub 2/S emissions at The Geysers involve chemical processes downstream of the turbine. EPRI has tested an upstream process that does not require chemical treatment of the main steam or condensate flow streams. This process involves condensing the steam and reboiling the condensate in a heat exchanger. Heat from the condensing steam on the inlet side is transferred to the outlet side to reboil the condensate. A small drop in steam temperature between the two sides of the heat exchanger drives the heat transfer. A large fraction of the noncondensable gases (over 95%) and a small fraction of the steam (typically 5%) are vented from the inlet side. This vent stream can be treated separately (aside from the main steam flow path) to remove and dispose of H/sub 2/S gas when abatement is required. The other gases (mostly CO/sub 2/) can be vented to the atmosphere.","","","","","","United States","1983-10-01T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: Geotherm.

The values of anti V/sup 0//sub 2/, anti C/sub P//sup 0//sub 2/, and anti C/sub V//sup 0//sub 2/ have been compared with calculations using the Born equation for 1 mol of hard-sphere ions of radius 0.327 nm. The Born equation gives reasonably accurate results with a single, adjustable radius for both volumetric and heat capacity effects, provided electrostatic effects are large compared to chemical effects. Large electrostatic effects are observed near the critical temperature and pressure. The experimental results for anti C/sub V//sup 0//sub 2/ up to 573 K show a small temperature dependence in contrast to the large temperature dependence of anti C/sub p//sup 0//sub 2/. The Born equation agrees with these results. The cause for the large difference between anti C/sub p//sup 0//sub 2/ and anti C/sub V//sup 0//sub 2/ is the large electrostrictive effect of the ions on the volume of the solution at these temperatures.","","","","","","United States","1983-08-18T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: J.

Tables 1 and 2 list the drilling information by area, operator, and well type. For a tabulation of all 1982 geothermal drilling activity, including holes less than 2,000 feet deep, readers are referred to the February 11, 1983, issue of Petroleum Information's ''National Geothermal Service.'' The number of geothermal wells drilled in 1982 to 2,000 feet or more decreased to 76 wells from 99 ''deep'' wells in 1981. Accordingly, the total 1982 footage drilled was 559,110 feet of hole, as compared to 676,127 feet in 1981. Most of the ''deep'' wells (49) completed were drilled for development purposes, mainly in The Geysers area of California. Ten field extension wells were drilled, of which nine were successful. Only six wildcat wells were drilled compared to 13 in 1980 and 20 in 1981, showing a slackening of exploration compared to earlier years. Geothermal drilling activity specifically for direct use projects also decreased from 1981 to 1982, probably because of the drastic reduction in government funding and the decrease in the price of oil. Geothermal power generation in 1982 was highlighted by (a) an increase of 110 Mw geothermal power produced at The Geysers (to a total of 1,019 Mw) by addition of Unit 17, and (b) by the start-up of the Salton Sea 10 Mw single flash power plant in the Imperial Valley, which brought the total geothermal electricity generation in this area to 31 Mw.","","","Republic Geothermal, Inc.","","","United States","1983-08-01T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: Geotherm.

Calcium carbonate scaling in a direct-contact binary-cycle geothermal power plant using up to 340/sup 0/F (170/sup 0/C) brine can be easily controlled with low dosages of a maleic terpolymer threshold antiscalant. This additive permits extended operation and reduces shutdown frequency for equipment maintenance. No significant additive/working-fluid interactions have been noted, although cleanout of prior scale gave a foamy suspension at the brine surface in the DCHX tower. The cost of using threshold antiscalant polymers in geothermal power plants suffering critical carbonate scaling is roughly an order of magnitude lower than the cost of periodic shutdown and cleaning. In this case, the additive cost was 0.06 /kW-hr of net power output, or 1.5% of power value.

However, the rock of the earth is hot at accessible depths everywhere, and this energy source is present beneath the surface in almost any location. The energy-extraction concept of the Hot Dry Rock (HDR) Geothermal Program as initially developed by the Los Alamos National Laboratory, is to ''mine'' this heat by creating a man-made reservoir in low-permeability, hot basement rock. This concept has been successfully proven at Fenton Hill in northern New Mexico by drilling two holes to a depth of approximately 3 km (10,000 ft) and a bottom temperature of 200/sup 0/C (392/sup 0/F), then connecting the boreholes with a large diameter, vertical hydraulic fracture. Water is circulated down one borehole, heated by the hot rock, and rises up the second borehole to the surface where the heat is extracted and the cooled water is reinjected into the underground circulation loop. This system has operated for a cumulative 416 days during engineering and reservoir testing. An energy equivalent of 3 to 5 MW(t) was produced without adverse environmental problems. During one test, a generator was installed in the circulation loop and produced 60 kw of electricity.","","","","","","United States","1983-07-01T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: Geotherm.

With air-cooling, accumulation of condensate, vapour and gas continues until the back-pressure brings the in-flowing steam to a halt and bubbling through the condensate ceases.

The reservoir model is a two-dimensional vertical east to west-southwest cross section, which is based on a recent hydrogeologic model of this geothermal system. The numerical code MULKOM is used in the simulation studies. The steady state pressure and temperature distributions are computed and compared against observed preproduction pressures and temperatures; a reasonable match is obtained. A natural hot water recharge rate of about 1 x 10/sup -2/ kg/s per meter of field length (measured in a north-south direction) is obtained. The model is then used to simulate the behavior of the field during the 1973-1978 production period. The response of the model to fluid extraction agrees to what has been observed in the field or postulated by other authors. There is a decrease in temperatures and pressures in the produced region. No extensive two-phase zone develops in the reservoir because of the strong fluid recharge. Most of the fluid recharging the system comes from colder regions located above and west of the produced reservoir. 34 references, 22 figures, 5 tables.","","","Lawrence Berkeley National Lab.

Liquid water, heated at depth in basement material, rises in the fracture system associated with the faulted region. When the fault is intersected by a horizontal layer of permeable material, charging of hot water into an adjacent aquifer can occur. The heat and mass transfer process for this system is defined in terms of natural and forced convection in a thermally active porous medium. Solutions to the basic mathematical model are obtained by finite-difference methods. The fluid mechanics and energy transport are resolved in both the narrow fault zone and the adjacent aquifer. The results show that previously developed asymptotic solutions, derived for large Rayleigh numbers and narrow fault zones, provide quite good predictions of the system heat and mass transport. The pressure field induced by fluid motion, typically about 50% of the cold hydrostatic head, is found to be quite sensitive to the input mass flux when the system Rayleigh number R is between 100 and 500. When R = 100, the convective upflow in the fault zone is cooled by conduction to the surface down to 60% of the system depth. In contrast, when R = 500, only about 20% of the fault is affected by cooling. The temperature variation with depth in the adjacent aquifer is nearly the background conductive form at about 5 fault denths away from the fault zone when R = 500. In comparison, when R = 100, the analogous distance is reduced to about 1 fault depth. The surface heat flux distribution is strongly dependent on the R value. Above the fault the heat flux value increases linearly with R in the range 100 to 500.","","","Mechanical Engineering, University of Colorado, Boulder, Colorado 80309","","","United States","1983-04-10T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: J.

The relative P and S wave velocity decrease is very close to values predicted by O'Connell and Budiansky (1974), who modeled velocities in rocks containing fluid-saturated and dry cracks. Because our data fit their model quite well, we attribute the velocity decrease to an increased density of the fluid-filled fractures in the reservoir. Fracture density parameters of O'Connell and Budiansky range as high as 0.365 near the main heat transfer areas of the geothermal reservior. The dynamic shear and Young's modulus are significantly lower near the principal reservoir. The dynamic shear and Young's modulus are significantly lower near the principal heat transfer surfaces, but the bulk modulus is largely unaffected. These observations suggest that the velocity differences are caused by fully saturated fractures. We demonstrate that the fractures inferred by this survey may have lengths as large as 70 cm. These fractures may have been caused by shear failure, microcracking associated with thermal drawdown, or thermal stress cracking.","","","Earth and Space Sciences Division, Los Alamos National Laboratory, Los Alamos, New Mexico 87545","","","United States","1983-04-10T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: J.

The high estimated rates of benthic nitrate flux (33 to 75 mg of N m/sup -2/ h/sup -1/) were a result of the activity of nitrifiers located in the sediment. Nitrifying potentials and ammonium oxidizer most probable numbers in the sediments were at least one order of magnitude higher than those in the waters. Nitrifiers in the oxyenated surface (0 to 2 cm) sediments were limited by suboptimal temperature, pH, and substrate level. Nitrifiers in deep (nonsurface) oxgyenated sediments did not contribute significantly to the changes measured in the levels of inorganic nitrogen species in the overlying waters and presumably derived their ammonium supply for ammonification within the sediment. Ammonium-oxidizing isolates obtained by a most-probable number nonenrichment procedure were species of either Nitrosospira or Nitrosomonas, whereas all those obtained by an enrichment procedure (i.e., selective culture) were Nitrosomonas spp. The efficiency of the most-probable-number method for enumerating ammonium oxidizers was calculated to be between 0.05 and 2.0%, suggesting that measurements of nitrifying potentials provide a better estimate of nitrifying populations.","","","Ministry of Works and Development, Hamilton, New Zealand","","","United States","1983-04-01T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: Appl.

Hot springs and geothermal resources exist throughout the rift and along the lineament. This widespread resource availability matches well with the distribution of energy-consuming population centers that have developed naturally along the Rio Grande. More than 300 known thermal springs and wells are found in New Mexico, primarily concentrated within and to the west of the Rio Grande Rift. Some of the better known hot springs, such as Ojo Caliente, Jemez Springs, Gila, Las Vegas, and Faywood Hot Springs, were first and still a prominent use of geothermal resources in New Mexico. Most of the state extending west from the rift exhibits characteristics associated with geothermal energy potential, namely, active extensional tectonics, recent volcanism, seismic activity, hydrothermal alteration, and high heat flow. This region contains eight known Geothermal Resource Areas, as defined by the U.S. Geological Survey, and eleven Known Geothermal Resource Fields as defined by the State Land Office.","","","Energy Inst., New Mexico State Univ., Las Cruces, NM","","","United States","1983-04-01T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: Geotherm.

Analytical solutions are developed for drawdowns in either layer and are evaluated numerically to illustrate some typical cases. The validity of the solution is demonstrated by comparison with the limiting single-layer case and with results from finite element calculations. Asymptotic solutions for small and large values of time are developed to show that (1) at early times with partial penetration the behavior of the pumped layer is exactly the same as that of a single layer and (2) at large values of time a semilog plot of drawdown versus time yields a straight line whose slope is only a function of the sum of the two transmissivities.

In geothermal reservoirs however the principal permeability arises from fractures, and a porous medium approach is not applicable. The dispersion of tracer material flowing in a fracture is shown to be dominated by molecular diffusion across the fracture - a mechanism known as Taylor dispersion. For typical values of reservoir parameters, this transverse diffusion will obliterate any transverse tracer concentration gradients caused by the velocity profile across the fracture. The effective dispersivity is found to be a function of fracture aperture, mean flow velocity and molecular diffusivity, and is orders of magnitude greater than for porous medium flow. Typically Peclet numbers are anticipated to lie between orders 1 and 100, and field results confirm this range.","","","","","","United States","1983-04-01T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: Geophys.

Regional geothermal exploration has been carried out in Egypt using the thermal gradient/heat flow technique and groundwater temperature/chemistry technique. In the thermal gradient/heat flow study, existing oil-well bottom-hole temperature data as well as subsurface temperature measurements in existing boreholes were utilized before special thermal gradient holes were drilled. Groundwater temperature and chemistry data were used to extend the geographic range of the direct subsurface thermal measurements. On a very modest budget, a regional thermal high has been discovered along the eastern margin of Egypt, and a local thermal anomaly has been discovered in this zone.

Before the overcoring test were undertaken, the geological and tectonic setting of the two sites were reviewed and it was concluded that the stress regimes should be similar. Both the Commonwealth Scientific and Industrial Research Organization (CSIRO) of Australia and the United States Bureau of Mines (USBM) designed overcoring systems were used, with a loca contractor providing the drilling services. A total of six CSIRO and seven USBM tests were successfully completed in two separate nearly horizontal boreholes with a 100/sup 0/ azimuth difference. Agreement between the CSIRO tests and the USBM tests was good.

Preliminary test results, using simulated geothermal steam and condensate, show that stripping can meet current requirements for plants located in The Geysers area of Northern California. In the most successful tests, better than 90 percent of the condensate H/sub 2/S was stripped, and the stripped effluent contained less than 1 ppMw H/sub 2/S. An economic analysis comparing costs for a stripping system versus a hydrogen-peroxide oxidation system indicates that stripping would be less expensive. Although stripping is more capital-intensive, operating costs are much higher for the peroxide process. Further, stripping is relatively insensitive to fluctuations in the H/sub 2/S content of the condensate, whereas chemical costs for the peroxide system are proportional to the condensate H/sub 2/S concentration. 6 figures, 2 tables.","","","Stone and Webster Engineering Corp., Denver, CO","","","United States","1983-03-01T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: Energy Prog.; (United States); Journal Volume: 3:1","","Medium: X; Size: Pages: 50-54","","","","Journal ID: CODEN: ENPGD","","","2009-12-17T00:00:00Z","6019780","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/6019780","","Energy Prog.; (United States)","","3:1"

Voluminous rhyolite ash flows, accompanied by formation of huge calderas, occurred approximately 2.0, 1.3, and 0.6 My B.P. Although the last lava flow was about 70,000 B.P., much evidence suggests that magma may still be present at relatively shallow depth. The evidence from gravity and magnetic lows, magnetotelluric soundings, seismic wave velocities, maximum depths of earthquake foci, significant recent uplift of the caldera floor, and exceptionally high heat flux suggest that magmatic temperatures may be attained 5 to 10 km beneath much of the caldera. Most of the hot-spring and geyser activity occurs within the caldera and along a fault zone that trends north from the caldera rim through Norris Geyser Basin and Mammoth Hot Springs. The thermal waters and gases have been extensively sampled and analyzed over a period of 100 years. The chemical, isotopic, and hydrologic data obtained from natural discharges and from shallow wells drilled in thermal areas, enable formulation of models of the hydrothermal system. No previous intermediate-depth drilling has been conducted at Yellowstone to help select the best location for a deep drill hole, and because Yellowstone is a National Park, no commercial drilling will be available for add-on experiments. Also, a deep drill hole in Yellowstone would have to be sited with great regard to environmental and ecological considerations. Nevertheless, the large amount of existing data is sufficient to formulate testable models. The Yellowstone thermal anomaly is so extensive and scientifically interesting that almost any suitable drilling site there may be superior to the best drilling site in any other silicic caldera complex in the United States.","","","Geological Survey, Menlo Park, CA","","","United States","1983-03-01T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: Geol.

The Thermal Regimes Panel of the Continental Scientific Drilling Committee in a draft report concludes that an understanding of active hydrothermal-magma systems requires drill-hole investigations of deeper and hotter levels than have been drilled and studied to date. The Panel groups hydrothermal-magma systems in the United States into five classes: (1) dominantly andesitic centers, (2) spreading ridges, (3) basaltic fields, (4) evolved basaltic centers, and (5) silicic caldera complexes. Application of eight scientific criteria and three social criteria leads to the conclusion that silicic caldera complexes should be the first target of a focused drilling program to investigate the hydrothermal-magma interface at depths of 5 to 7 km. Primary targets are the three young, silicic caldera systems in the western conterminous United States: Yellowstone (Wyoming), Valles (New Mexico), and Long Valley (California). Scientific drilling of these active hydrothermal-magma systems complements scientific drilling proposed for fossil systems such as Creede (Colorado). In addition, the roots of the Salton Sea geothermal system (California) present an opportunity for add-on deep drilling and scientific experiments to supplement geothermal drilling by industry in this active spreading-ridge environment.","","","Geological Survey, Menlo Park, CA","","","United States","1983-03-01T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: Geol.

Four overlapping, possibly interrelated geological events have been identified: (1) Laramide deformation; (2) voluminous volcanic activity (approx. 43 to approx. 21 My); (3) development of broad, relatively deep north-west trending basins (starting about 28 to 29 My), with associated volcanism; and (4) block faulting and volcanism (9 to 3 My) with development of the modern northerly trending rift basins, and regional uplift. The southern Rio Grande rift is characterized by high heat flow, and seismic, gravity and electrical data indicate anomalous structure in the lower crust and/or uppermost mantle beneath the rift. The first voluminous volcanic event caused significant heating of the crust in an arc environment, and probably caused crustal melting. The brittle/ductile transition was very shallow (<10 km), and with a change to an extensional stress regime, north-west trending basins developed in response to lithospheric necking, with continued volcanism in a back-arc environment. During the mid Miocene, the crust cooled, the brittle/ductile transition became deeper, and when a new extensional stress regime was established (approx. 9 My), the northerly trending modern fault block basins were developed. Lower lithospheric extension during this second extensional phase was probably accommodated by plastic deformation and basaltic intrusion, the latter maintaining the modern high heat flow.

Integration of the results has led to thermal and non-thermal waters. Integration of the results has led to development of a target model for hydrothermal resources on the margin of the Idaho Batholith. Warfield Hot Springs, with temperatures up to 58/sup 0/C, flow from a major shear zone along the margin of an apophysis of the batholith. Hailey Hot Springs, with temperatures up to 60/sup 0/C, occur in an area of normal and thrust faults in the Paleozoic Milligen and Wood River Formations, 2.5 km from a highly brecciated batholith contact. Other Wood River district hydrothermal systems also occur along the margins of batholith apophyses or in adjacent highly fractured Paleozoic rocks. The Wood River district thermal waters are geochemically district from the local ground water. Thermal waters circulate through batholith rocks, with little or no equilibration with Paleozoic sedimentary or Tertiary volcanic rocks. The thermal waters are high F (11 to 19 ppM), low TDS (190 to 322 ppM) NaHCO/sub 3/-SO/sub 4/ waters, with up to half of the TDS as silica. The Magic Hot Springs system is higher TDS (about 1000 ppM) than the other sites. Geochemical thermometers for most systems are below 100/sup 0/C; Magic Hot Springs is about 150/sup 0/C. Thermal waters at the margin of the batholith are chemically similar to those in the interior of the batholith. The location of thermal systems at the margin of small apophyses of the Idaho Batholith is similar to other thermal systems in the western US. The waters circulate deep in the batholith rocks, and surface in either the intrusive or intruded rocks. Specific thermal systems are controlled by the most favorable fracture permeability for the circulation of water.","","","Earth Science Lab., Salt Lake City, UT","","","United States","1983-03-01T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: Geol.

Major ions of wells do increase in concentration along the groundwater flow path. However, contour maps of sulfate, chloride, and sodium ion concentrations of 60 wells show that there is no trend in areas of non-thermal water. The ion concentrations increase only near thermal wells, indicating mixing of thermal/non-thermal waters. Carbon-13 analyses of one thermal area confirms considerable mixing with non-thermal water. Stable isotopes of water (oxygen-18 and deuterium) show aquifer water is isotopically depleted near mountain front stream channels, suggesting summer recharge. The basin center is more isotopically depleted, which suggests year-round recharge via deep percolation. Tritium and carbon-14 age dating of water demonstrate that the youngest water is along the recharge mountain front with wells containing modern tritium activity. The oldest non-thermal water is in the basin center, possibly up to 1000 years old. Age dating also suggests leakage from the Carson River into the groundwater system whereas previous investigations suggest groundwater discharge to the river. Two thermal springs previously defined as similar water are shown to have greatly differing ages. Carson Hot Springs is found to be the oldest water in the basin, containing water about 12,000 years old.","","","Desert Research Inst., Reno, NV","","","United States","1983-03-01T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: Geol.

Early episodes of magma injection beneath the steam field are indicated by hypabyssal rhyolitic and dacitic rocks that intruded to within a kilometer of the surface, dated by the Union Oil Co. at 1.6 to 2.5 My; and by small rhyolite extrusive bodies dated by the US Geological Survey at about 2.0 My. Later intrusion of magma is indicated by the rhyolite and dacite domes and flows on nearby Cobb Mountain, which are dated at 1.0 to 1.1 My. Episodes of magma injection were accompanied in the subsurface by fracturing of the intruded wallrocks and tourmalinization (probably at greater than or equal to 350/sup 0/C) in contact zones around the intrusions. High-temperature (greater than or equal to 290/sup 0/C) hot water circulation below 920 m is indicated by vein assemblages of epidote +- pyrrhotite. At depths as shallow as 100 m, lower temperature (greater than or equal to 210/sup 0/C) hot-water circulation is suggested by later veins of quartz +- adularis +- chlorite +- white mica +- pyrite; the paragenetically late adularia is dated at 0.69 +- 0.03 My. These lower temperature shallower vein assemblages were followed locally by deposition of datolite, pyrite, galena, sphalerite, minor cinnabar, and calcite in veinlets, cavities, and vugs. This latest hydrothermal mineral assemblage may record an increase in temperature or decrease in pressure, possibly associated with flipover to a vapor-dominated system.

The ages at lower elevation in these areas are, in general, younger than those at higher elevation because of cooling as uplift occurs. Thus apparent uplift rates can be calculated from this relation between elevation and age, assuming that the geothermal gradient remained constant during uplift and erosion. Age dates on samples from the Wheeler Peak area north of Taos and the Sandia Mountains near Albuquerque indicate that the rocks at the higher elevations in these areas cooled to approx. 105/sup 0/C 30 to 35 Ma ago. The dates suggest that Precambrian rocks in the Wheeler Peak area were heated by a thermal event related to the Questa Caldera. Dates for the Tertiary intrusions in this area imply that uplift at an apparent rate of 0.1 mm/a has occurred since the intrusions cooled (20 Ma). The uplift of Sandia block, which does not seem to be directly associated with igneous activity, occurred at an average rate of .055 mm/a. Dates from the Organ batholith in southern New Mexico do not show a clear relation with elevation. The fission track dates (16 to 36 Ma) are consistent with shallow emplacement and subsequent rapid uplift of the batholith followed by formation of small geothermal systems sometime later in the Tertiary. In contrast to the other three areas where Tertiary tectonic activity affects the ages, dates from the Sangre de Cristo Mountains east of Sante Fe are related to Laramide uplift about 65 to 70 Ma ago. The apparent uplift rate is 0.072 mm/a. The data on the rate and timing of uplift imply that the heat sources that have caused the Tertiary tectonic and igneous features observed in the rift are not continuous along the rift's length, but are localized phenomena.","","","Southern Methodist Univ., Dallas, TX","","","United States","1983-03-01T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: Geol.

Tectonically, the caldera is located at the intersection of the Jemez Lineament and Rio Grande rift, both of which are associated with high heat flow and Quaternary volcanism. Detailed temperature logs from 70 shallow boreholes and 15 deep geothermal wells constitute the data base for the present study. The temperature gradient data have been fit to a low order and a high order polynomial with the following results: (1) Temperature gradients typically range from 100 to 500/sup 0/C/km although several wells located in hot spring areas have gradients as high as 700/sup 0/C/km. (2) The thermal anomaly associated with the Valles Caldera is areally quite extensive with the 200/sup 0/C/km contour (high order polynomial) enclosing roughly 150 km/sup 2/. (3) A low order polynomial fit to the data yields an excellent correlation between the temperature gradient contours and the main ring fracture system of the caldera, implying that both the thermal and structural anomalies originate from the same source. This is taken as evidence for a shallow magma chamber beneath the calders. (4) Maximum subsurface temperatures measured in the deep geothermal wells are roughly 330/sup 0/C although 280/sup 0/ to 310/sup 0/ is more typical.

Profiles were designed to map distribution and depth of low velocity anomalies as indicators of possible shallow magma chambers and/or fractured porous regions. Interpretation of records from 6 shotpoints recorded by a 60-station seismic net indicates: (1) There are considerable variations in near-surface seismic velocities and thicknesses overlying the topographically irregular basement (average V approx. 6.0 km/s). (2) The major shallow (2 to 10 km) anomaly is a 10-km-dia, low P-velocity (approx. 5.5 km/s) region directly below the resurgent dome that was uplifted approx. 1 km after the last caldera collapse. This velocity is not low enough to unequivocally indicate still-molten material but instead may be a deeply buried tuff layer. (3) Anomalies in travel times, frequency content, and waveforms of transmitted waveforms from regional and teleseismic sources suggest an approx. 30-km-dia anomaly extends from shallow (approx. 5 km) depth to at least Moho levels (approx. 40 km). (4) Reflections from largely horizontal surfaces (sills, magma chamber roofs, etc.) are not clearly observed, suggesting complicated three-dimensional structure. In contrast to the Jemez, data from the Socorro area (another region where transverse fractures intersect the rift) indicate predominantly horizontal midcrustal structure dominated by a thin (<1 km), complexly laminated, sill-like magma layer.","","","","","","United States","1983-03-01T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: Geol.

Because such centers are typically associated with highly developed convective hydrothermal systems and because of the on-going interest among the scientific community in understanding the intercoupling of shallow hydrothermal reservoirs with magmatic heat sources at depth in the crust, these volcanic complexes have been studied for many years by workers interested in a variety of geological problems. One research technique which has been relatively underexploited in the Long Valley/Mono Basin volcanic complex is scientific drilling to intermediate depths (2 to 3 km). Such a research program might clarify many of the present issues concerning this volcanic complex. For example, we may have, in Long Valley, an opportunity for defining the initial conditions associated with the evolution of metallogenic deposits. In addition, this region offers a unique opportunity in volcanic and earthquake hazards research. Recent tectonic activity caused the USGS to issue a potential volcanic hazards notice for the southwestern segment of Long Valley caldera. Finally, a surprising result of commercial drilling for geothermal energy in this area is the failure to directly detect high temperature hydrothermal reservoirs. Their presence, however, can be inferred from indirect evidence. Thus, future surface geophysical and geological studies in conjunction with intermediate depth drilling might help elucidate basic questions regarding metallogenesis, the mitigation of volcanic and earthquake hazards, and the development of conventional and non-conventional forms of geothermal energy.","","","Brown Univ., Providence, RI","","","United States","1983-03-01T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: Geol.

The heat-flow estimates are calculated from corrected bottom-hole temperature derived gradients and from thermal conductivity measurements and estimates. The heat-flow mean may well change as more data sites are added or as sites are thought to be outside the rift. The deep estimates, consistent with previous shallow data, suggest the Rio Grande rift is regionally an area of elevated heat flow; elevated above the average heat flow for the Basin and Range. This preliminary data indicates little statistical difference between heat-flow means in the central Rift (Albuquerque Basin) and in the southern Rift. If recent extension is more profound in the southern part of the Rift, then heat replenishment sources associated with less profound extension may be contributing to the heat flow in the central Rift. Noticeable heat-flow differences over a few tens of km may also have important implications with regard to petroleum maturation. Hopefully, more deep heat-flow estimates will be forthcoming and will reflect on these possibilities.","","","New Mexico Inst. of Mining and Technology, Socorro","","","United States","1983-03-01T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: Geol.

The absence of an /sup 18/O shift in the thermal waters suggests they were never heated above 100/sup 0/C; thus their circulation depths are limited. /sup 14/C ground-water ages of less than 12,000 radiocarbon years do not substantiate the long residence times expected with deep circulation in the basement rocks. Ionic exchange of Ca/sup 2 +/ in the thermal water do, however, suggest migration of thermal water from granitic aquifers to the overlying volcanoclastic aquifers. From the geochemical and isotopic data and the high heat flow along the Foothills fault system a new flow model of the thermal regime has been developed. The model consists of deep, closed cell, convective heat transfer and ground-water flow in the crystalline basement rocks from which heat is conductively transferred to a shallowly circulating ground-water system near the crystalline-volcanoclastic contact. This shallow system is recharged in the foothills of the Idaho Batholith, is heated near the Foothills fault and then flows into the volcanoclastic sequence via faluts in the Foothills fault zone.","","","Univ. of Colorado, Colorado Springs","","","United States","1983-03-01T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: Geol.

Isotopic values are unrelated to salinity for comparison between lakes. Stable isotopes also reveal the sources of hot spring discharges: the Kapedo hot springs probably originate from Maralel and not from Lake Baringo as local legend has it; the hot springs north of Lake Naivasha are of meteoric origin while those to the south of Lake Naivasha have similar isotopic compositions to Lake Naivasha.","","","Univ. of Utah, Salt Lake City","","","United States","1983-03-01T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: Geol.

It is inferred from this plot that points falling below the trend indicate Cs depleted waters. A plot of Cs:CHO/sub 3//Cl, another measure of rock-water interaction, also indicates Cs removal from the waters. These data correlate well with a parallel study of chemistry and mineralogy of hydrothermally altered rocks from the drill holes which show that the rocks involved in hydrothermal rock-water reactions are vitrophyric rhyolite lava flows and pumiceous tuff overlain by obsidian-rich sands and gravels. Nearly 55 m of such a section from well Y-8 has been hydrothermally altered into alternating intervals consisting of analcime - quartz - clay (smectite, celadonite) or clinoptilolite - ..cap alpha..-cristobalite - smectite. Whole rock analyses of randomly selected samples of these intervals from several wells have Cs contents somewhat higher than those of the unaltered host rhyolite. However, the Cs content of the analcime - quartz - clay intervals is as much as 700 times higher than that of the host rock. Analyses of mineral separates show that analcime, containing as much as 4700 ppM Cs, is more enriched in Cs than any other mineral. Examination of experimental data suggests that Cs is incorporated into the analcime structure during crystallization.

Many of these waters have low to moderate temperatures (30 to 50/sup 0/). These waters may be a masked vestige of hot reservoirs at depth or may be direct discharge for deep circulating waters in systems with normal thermal characteristics. Moderate temperature waters flow from springs and wells in the basin sediments of the Safford Basin in southeastern Arizona. Integration of geologic, hydrologic, major-ion chemical, stable and radioisotope data from Safford indicates that the Safford thermal waters are produced by deep circulation into the basin, which has relatively normal thermal characteristics. These waters are forced to the surface by pressure derived from the high-standing mountain ranges at the basin margins. The absence of shifts in isotopic composition off the meteoric line indicates that temperatures in the reservoirs are too low to permit boiling (shift to the left) or water-mineral isotope exchange reactions (shift to the right). In the absence of shifts, the isotopic compositions of the thermal waters indicate the isotopic compositions in their source area and imply that the surrounding mountain ranges were the source area. Radiocarbon ages indicate that ground water and the minerals in the aquifers are in equilibrium. The water-mineral equilibria relationships of waters sampled along the flow path also indicate a mountain source for the thermal waters and define the flow paths of waters from the mountain ranges deep into the basin sediments. Similar studies can be applied to geothermal systems throughout the Basin and Range, providing that variations in the stable isotope and major-ion chemistry of waters are discernable in the basin of interest.","","","","","","United States","1983-03-01T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: Geol.

NNW-trending normal faults near the edges of the Blackfoot Lava Field appear to be the dominant structural control of spring activity in the region. Surface spring-water temperatures average 14/sup 0/C except for a group of springs west of the Reservoir Mountains along Corral Creek, which average 33/sup 0/C. Chemical geothermometers, which indicate temperatures of last water-rock equilibrium, applied to fifty water samples give temperatures of less than 75/sup 0/C except for the eight springs along Corral Creek. The Corral Creek springs have Na-K-Ca temperatures of 324/sup 0/C to 370/sup 0/C that are a direct result of large concentrations of potassium in the water (greater than 200 ppM). A correction for CO/sub 2/ applied to the Na-K-Ca geothermometer lowers the estimated temperatures of the anomalous springs to near the measured surface temperatures. Mixing model calculations suggest that hot water with a maximum temperature of approximately 67/sup 0/C may be mixing with cooler, more dilute water in the springs from Corral Creek. Stability relations of low-temperature phases in the systems K/sub 2/O-Al/sub 2/O/sub 3/-SiO/sub 2/-H/sub 2/O-CO/sub 2/ and Na/sub 2/O-Al/sub 2/O/sub 3/-SiO/sub 2/-H/sub 2/O-CO/sub 2/ indicate that the large concentrations of potassium in the eight anomalous springs are derived from equilibrium reactions with feldspars, CO/sub 2/ and H/sub 2/S gases may be derived by the oxidation of organic matter and the reduction of sulfate. The observed elemental concentrations in the spring water and gases are due to water-rock reactions at temperatures less than 100/sup 0/C that can be reached at depths of 1 to 2 kilometers below the surface.","","","","","","United States","1983-03-01T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: Geol.

Geothermal exploration in the caldera region during the last 10 years provides subsurface data which refine our knowledge of deep caldera structure, but raise some questions concerning current models of resurgent cauldrons. For example, a detailed gravity investigation using 730 stations (Segar, 1974) shows a circular negative gravity anomaly centered over the caldera (as expected) but also indicates a strong northeast-trending grain of fault blocks in pre-caldera rocks, that are generally down-faulted to the southeast toward the Rift. Gravity data do not define a diapir structure beneath the resurgent dome attributable to tumescent magma; instead of a northeast-trending horst underlies the Redondo Peak segment of the dome. Interpretation of stratigraphy from many geothermal wells suggests that the caldera and resurgent dome are floored by untilted fault blocks (Hulen and Nielson, 1982). In addition, drilling to Precambrian basement and depths of 3.2 km has not encountered a large intrusive rhyolite that might logically produce tumescence of the dome. The new data indicate that the subsurface structural configuration of Valles Caldera is controlled by pre-caldera tectonics and that a more complicated mechanism is required to explain the resurgent dome standing high inside the caldera. A refined mechanism of resurgence might be one result of CSDP drilling at Valles Caldera.","","","Los Alamos National Lab., NM","","","United States","1983-03-01T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: Geol.

Two types of mineralized waters issue from the Lucero region; a relatively saline (high-Cl, high-SO/sub 4/) type and a relatively dilute (low-Cl, high-SO/sub 4/) type. Emergence temperatures of both range from 12 to 26/sup 0/C.

We see no evidence for mixing between the two water types. Dilute mineral waters, which issue from a large area of Chinle Formation on the west side of the Lucero uplift, may be useful, with appropriate design, for low-temperature geothermal applications. Saline mineral waters, which leak from a zone of faulted and folded rocks along the Comanche Fault zone to the east, do not appear to have much, if any, geothermal potential due to their low temperature, restricted distribution, and high concentration of dissolved solids.

Volcanic activity began here about 12 My ago and has continued intermittently. Two major eruptions, 1.4 My and 1.1 My ago, produced large volumes of rhyolitic tephra; each was accompanied by cauldron subsidence. Valles Caldera is an attractive CSD site because: (1) The broad outlines of the regional and local geology, geophysics, and geochemistry have been well studied. (2) Lithologic, geochemical, and thermal data have been obtained from many geothermal wells drilled to depths as great as 4.5 km. (3) Liquid and possible vapor-dominated hydrothermal systems occur, as do a variety of surface hot springs. (4) Several geophysical anomalies suggest magma or partly crystallized molten material at depth. The following observations and recommendations come from a Valles Caldera workshop held in 1982. There should be a program of intermediate-depth drilling (1 to 2 km) followed by one or more very deep holes that might answer such questions as: (1) What is the nature of the hydrothermal system created when a silicic magma body intrudes the earth's crust. (2) What is the structure of the basement under this deep hydrothermal system.(3) How does fluid geochemistry vary among the various hydrothermal and hot dry rock systems. (4) How accurate are current models for describing the dynamics of caldera formation and resurgence. (5) What is the nature of heat transfer from magma to overlying convecting hydrous fluids.

Many of the temperature-depth profiles are nonlinear. Upward convection of water is the most likely explanation for the curvature of the temperature profiles, since other possible causes, including variations in bottom water temperatures, conductivity changes with depth in the sediments, and experimental error, can be eliminated. This interpretation requires water velocities of the order of 7 x 10/sup -8/ m/s, which is unusual because the lithosphere is relatively old (72-82 m.y.) and a thick sedimentary cover (1-2.5 km) is present. These observations suggest that the processes causing deformation of the plate have increased the heat flux through the sediment-water interface. We infer that extra heat is being generated at shallow depths (perhaps less than 35 km) in the plate, although the specific mechanism by which deformational energy is converted into heat is difficult to determine.","","","Lamont-Doherty Geological Observatory of Columbia University, Palisades, New York 10964","","","United States","1983-02-10T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: J.

Permeability and the hydraulic impedance of each sediment layer were estimated from measured values of porosity. The gradients of porosity and density with depth where sediment layers are thin (< or approx. =50 m thick) are anomalously high compared with those of other areas and with the upper part of thicker sediment layers in this area. A good correlation was found between the anomalous porosity and density gradients and the present-day heat flow. We interpret these observations to suggest that these high gradients may be due to active hydrothermal circulation through a thin sediment cover, which is inhibited by a thicker sediment layer, and that the pattern of hydrothermal circulation may be essentially fixed with the moving plate. Hydraulic impedance of the sediment layer was estimated from the observed depth variation of porosity and was shown to increase rapidly with its thickness. Our interpretation that a threshold thickness of about 50 m would inhibit direct diffuse discharge or recharge of hydrothermal flow through the undisturbed sediment layer yields an average permeability of the underlying basement layer of about 3-6 x 10/sup -14/ m/sup 2/ (30-60 mdarcies).","","","Ocean Research Institute, University of Tokyo, Nakano, Tokyo 164, Japan","","","United States","1983-02-10T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: J.

Pore waters were collected by centrifuging, squeezing, and in situ sampling: analyses are presented here for Ca, Mg, Si, NH/sub 3/, Mn, and Fe. Our results confirm Maris and Bender's (1982) conclusions that hydrothermal solutions enriched in Ca by 1-2 mM and depleted in Mg by approx.2 mM are upwelling through the mounds and the surrounding pelagic sediments. Si, NH/sub 3/, and Mn/sup 2 +/ concentrations generally increase upcore, reflecting addition of products of metabolic reactions to upwelling hydrothermal solutions. Pore water iron concentrations decrease upcore, probably as a result of oxidation and precipitation of upwelling hydrothermal iron. The formation of nontronite (Fe(III)/sub 4/Si/sub 8/O/sub 20/(OH)/sub 4/) involves oxidation of dissolved Fe/sup 2 +/. Several models, constrained by the electron balance, are proposed to explain the process of nontronite formation. The stratigraphy of the mounds (thick nontronite covered by a thin MnO/sub 2/ crust) may be explained by postulating Fe/sup 2 +/ oxidation by MnO/sub 2/ and replacement of MnO/sub 2/ by nontronite at the base of the MnO/sub 2/ crust, followed by upward migration of Mn/sup 2 +/ and precipitation of MnO/sub 2/ at the sediment water interface.","","","Graduate School of Oceanography, University of Rhode Island, Kingston, Rhode Island 02881","","","United States","1983-02-10T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: J.

A major concern in this application is the foam-forming ability of a surfactant system in the harsh geothermal environment. While investigating the stability of various foams in an autoclave, we observed a dramatic increase in drainage times with increasing generation pressure, even though the liquid volume fraction of the foam was held constant. This effect appears to result from a decrease in cell size with increasing autoclave pressure and therefore is an artifact of the foam generation technique in which the pressure path of the foam changes with autoclave pressure. A theoretical model of drainage predicts that drainage times should increase with decreasing cell size, as observed. These results emphasize that proper control of cell size can have a substantial effect on the apparent stability of a foam.","","","Sandia Natl.

The organic Rankine cycle is reviewed for efficiency. A pressure-enthalpy diagram for R-114 (the refrigerant chosen for this study) is given. In the cycle, refrigerant is vaporized, then expanded, to turn the shaft, then condensed, then pumped back into the cycle. The cycle depends on the difference between the evaporating pressure and the condensing pressure. The higher the geothermal water temperature, and the lower the cooling water temperature, the higher the work. Heat loss due to radiation and convection, the movement of refrigerant fluid through the evaporator, in the conversion of expanded power to electrical power, and in use of some actual produced power to pump the cooling water and drive the tower fans--all these heat losses are calculated.

The State of Alaska ranked second among oil-producing states during 1982. The 2 petroleum-producing areas, the North Slope and Cook Inlet, both on state lands, provided at total of 619 million bbl of oil and 191 billion cu ft of natural gas. Of the major coal fields in Alaska, only the Beluga-Capps Glacier, Nenana, and Bering River fields are being studied currently for future development. The U.S. Geological Survey has been making engineering studies of the Beluga area for some years. Because of low demand and prices, large uranium supplies, and high costs of logistics in exploration in Alaska, uranium work by industry is at a near standstill. Widespread volcanic activity in Alaska suggests a large potential for geothermal energy. Presently, much of this energy appears to be suitable mainly for local use. 238 references.","","","","","","United States","1983-01-01T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: U.S. Geol.

Recent interest in exploiting natural heat resources at temperatures below 300 degrees F. and in using the geothermal capacity of aquifers to store heat poses a problem for potential users and developers. Federal and state statutes either do not regulate its use or they regulate as though it were the same as the rare, high temperature resource and worthy of the same high burden. The extraction process is pushed into a statutory scheme oriented toward scarcity, protection of prior users, and finite resource management, all of which have nothing to do with the abundance of heat and its potential market.

Peak values occur in fumaroles of vapor-dominated systems, around hot springs, and in zones overlying steeply dipping, hot-water aquifers. Aureole values (up to several 100 ppb Hg) are found in zones surrounding the peak areas and delineate areas with shallow geothermal convection. Background values vary between 7 and 40 ppb Hg (geometric mean). Usually, Hg is present in a form that can be easily re-volatilized and released to the atmosphere. Altered areas related to fossil hydrothermal systems can be distinguished from alteration related to active systems by their Hg contents. In the rare cases of Hg enrichments as cinnabar or as traces in other sulphides (pyrite, sphalerite) the Hg is not easily released from its host phase, and distinction between active and fossil systems is not possible. Hg anomaly patterns yield information on the presence as well as the geometry of shallow geothermal circulation patterns. In conjunction with structural geologic data, Hg patterns can be helpful in defining reservoir boundaries and can aid in the selection of drill site location.","","","Departments of Geology and Chemistry, Arizona State University, Tempe, AZ 85287","","","United States","1983-01-01T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: Geothermics; (United States); Journal Volume: 12:1","","Medium: X; Size: Pages: 29-48","","","","Journal ID: CODEN: GTMCA","10.1016/0375-6505(83)90039-1","","2016-04-11T00:00:00Z","5279624","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/5279624","","Geothermics; (United States)","","12:1"

For low salinity geothermal fluids the latter is related to the composition of the fluid, particularly the concentration of carbon dioxide remaining after the removal of steam for power generation using conventional separators. In general terms the higher the gas content of the initial deep aquifer fluid, the higher will be the pH of the waste waters, so that in many fields, where reservoir temperatures fall in the range 250 to 280/sup 0/C, careful choice of separation pressures to maximise gas removal and hence elevate the pH of residual waters may obviate the problems of silica deposition, or the need to install costly chemical treatments such as acid or alkali addition. In designing and operating separators or flash plants it is important to avoid carryover of steam (containing CO/sub 2/ and H/sub 2/S) into the water reticulation lines, where, after heat loss, condensation occurs with resultant lower pH and higher scaling potential. Where flash plants are designed to receive a mixture of the two-phase discharges from a number of wells, consideration of the pH of the residual water resulting from steam separation may provide design constraints on the reticulation network such that silica scaling potential is minimised or entirely avoided. The Wairakei and Broadlands (Ohaaki) fields are used as examples of these design considerations in relation to the reservoir chemistry of the field and possible changes during extensive exploitation.","","","Chemistry Division, DSIR, Wairakei, Private Bag, Taupo","","","United States","1983-01-01T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: Geothermics; (United States); Journal Volume: 12:4","","Medium: X; Size: Pages: 307-321","","","","Journal ID: CODEN: GTMCA","10.1016/0375-6505(83)90004-4","","2016-05-27T00:00:00Z","6132178","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/6132178","","Geothermics; (United States)","","12:4"

Estimated maximum paleotemperatures for the Basin are generally consistent with the regional pretroleum production, oil production occurring in the cooler regions around the western, southern and eastern periphery, gas production occurring in the warmer central and northern areas. Paleotemperatures in upper Pennsylvanian rocks, in the northern and perhaps central parts of the Basin, have likely exceeded the dry gas preservation limit (150/sup 0/C for Cretaceous rock in the Gulf Coast); therefore Paleozoic petroleum production in these areas is questionable.","","","New Mexico Bureau of Mines and Mineral Resources and Geoscience Department, New Mexico Institute of Mining and Technology, Socorro, NM","","","United States","1983-01-01T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: Geothermics; (United States); Journal Volume: 12:4","","Medium: X; Size: Pages: 323-339","","","","Journal ID: CODEN: GTMCA","10.1016/0375-6505(83)90005-6","","2016-05-09T00:00:00Z","6205931","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/6205931","","Geothermics; (United States)","","12:4"

The thermal waters are very low in dissolved solids (250mg/l), and, therefore, corrosion problems should be minimal in steam turbines. Development of the geothermal resource in the Chalk Creek area has been limited so far to direct use in greenhouses, swimming pools, and residential space heating.

The most cost-effective methods of waste heat dissipation involve the evaporation of water, yet most of the important hydrothermal resources of the U.S. are located in areas where cooling tower makeup water for power plants is in short supply. Flashed-steam power cycles can use condensate derived from the geofluid for tower makeup unless reinjection is necessary, as is already required at some sites. Condensate is not available from binary cycles because the geofluid is reinjected. Geothermal station makeup water requirements have been estimated at 50 -- 100 m/sup 3//yr per kW of electrical capacity. Some of the methods currently being studied in the U.S. for reducing waste heat dissipation system costs and water consumption are: allowing plant power output to vary with ambient conditions; use of ammonia to transport waste heat from the turbine condenser to air-cooled coils; development of plastic-membrane type wet/dry tower; marketing of steam turbines that can tolerate a wider range o back pressures; use of circulating water storage to delay heat dissipation until more favourable ambient conditions exist; development of tubes with enhanced heat transfer surfaces to reduce condenser capital costs; and use of evaporative condensers to reduce costs in binary cycles. Many of these projects involve large-scale tests that are now installed and producing some preliminary data.

The changes are attributed to production and natural recharge. To the observed geophysical phenomena, a simple reservoir simulation study combined with the appropriate DC resistivity calculations to determine the expected magnitude of apparent resistivity change. The authors consider production from a liquid dominated reservoir with dimensions and parameters of the Cerro Prieto 'A' reservoir and assume lateral and vertical recharge of colder and less saline waters. Based on rather schematic one- and two-dimensional reservoir simulations, we calculate changes in formation resistivity which we then transform into changes in apparent resistivity that would be observed at the surface. Simulated changes in apparent resistivities over the production zone show increases of 10 to 20% over a 3 year period at the current rate of fluid extraction. Changes of this magnitude are not only within our ability to discern using proper field techniques, but are consistent in magnitude with some of the observed effects. However, the patterns of apparent resistivity changes in the simulated dipole-dipole pseudosection only partially resemble the observed field data. This is explained by the fact that the actual fluid recharge into the 'A' reservoir is more complicated than assumed in our simple, schematic recharge models. DC resistivity monitoring appears capable of providing indirect information on fluid flow processes in a producing geothermal reservoir. Such information is extremely valuable for the development of quantitative predictions of future reservoir performance.","","","Lawrence Berkeley Laboratory, University of California, Berkeley","","","United States","1983-01-01T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: Geothermics; (United States); Journal Volume: 12:4","","Medium: X; Size: Pages: 291-306","","","","Journal ID: CODEN: GTMCA","10.1016/0375-6505(83)90003-2","","2016-04-15T00:00:00Z","6030083","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/6030083","","Geothermics; (United States)","","12:4"

To date, over 20 wells have been drilled on the prospect, and the data from these wells indicate the presence of a high-temperature, liquid-dominated reservoir. In this paper, data from the open literature on the physical characteristics of the field are used to estimate the amount of hot water in place (reservoir capacity) and the length of time the reservoir can supply steam for a 50-MW/sub e/ power plant (reservoir longevity). The reservoir capacity is estimated to be 10/sup 12/ kg of hot fluid by volumetric calculations using existing geological, geophysical, and well data. The criteria used are described and the sensitivity of the results discussed. The longevity of the field is studied using a two-phase numerical simulator (SHAFT79). A number of cases are simulated based upon different boundary condition and upon injection and production criteria. The results obtained from the simulation studies indicate that it is questionable that the Baca field can supply enough steam for a 50-MW/sub e/ power plant for 30 years. Although the estimated reservoir reserves greatly exceed those needed for a 50-MW/sub e/ power plant, the low transmissivity of the reservoir would cause localized boiling and rapid pressure decline during exploitation. It is therefore apparent that the conventional zero-dimensional (lumped parameter models) cannot be used to evaluate the generation capacities of low-permeability fields such as the Baca field.","","","Lawrence Berkeley Lab., California","","","United States","1982-12-01T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: Water Resour.

The extraction problem has been highlighted by the recent termination of a federal geothermal demonstration project at the Baca field of the Valles Caldera, New Mexico, the sixth largest geothermal province in the United States.

Interpretation of the gradient contrast in terms of a simple mode for the conductivity of an aggregate yields the mean ice content (approx.39%), and thermal conductivities for the frozen and thawed section (8.1 and 4.7 mcal/cm s /sup 0/C, respectively). These results yield a heat flow of approx.1.3 HFU, which is similar to other values on the Alaskan Arctic Coast; the anomalously deep permafrost is a result of the anomalously high conductivity of the siliceous ice-rich sediments. Curvature in the upper 160 m of the temperature profiles represents a warming of approx.1.8 /sup 0/C of the mean surface temperature and a net accumulation of 5--6 kcal/cm/sup 2/ by the solid earth surface during the last 100 years or so. Rising sea level and thawing of ice-rich sea cliffs probably caused the shoreline to advance tens of kilometers in the last 20,000 years, inundating a portion of the continental shelf that is presently the target of intensive oil exploration. A simple conduction model suggests that this recently inundated region is underlain by near-melting ice-rich permafrost to depths of 300--500 m; its presence is important to seismic interpretations in oil exploration and to engineering considerations in oil production. With confirmation of the permafrost configuration by offshore drilling, heat conduction models can yield reliable new information on the chronology of arctic shorelines.","","","U. S.

These observations have been generally accepted as providing conclusive evidence that the liquid saturation must be rather small (<50%) in order that liquid may be nearly immobile. This conclusion ignores the crucial role of conductive heat transfer mechanisms in fractured reservoirs for vaporizing liquid flowing under two-phase conditions. We have developed a multiple interacting continuum method (MINC) for numerically simulating two-phase flow of a homogeneous fluid in a fractured porous medium. Application of this method to reservoir conditions representative of The Geyers, California, and results from an analytical approximation show that, for matrix permeability less than a critical value (roughly-equal2.5 to 5 microdarcies), the mass flux of water from the matrix to the fractures will be continuously vaporized by heat transported due to conduction. This gives rise to production of superheated steam even when the matrix has nearly full liquid saturation. Simple estimates also show that heat-driven steam/water counterflow can maintain a nearly vapor static vertical pressure profile in the presence of mobile liquid water in a reservoir with low vertical matrix permeability. The implication of these findings is that the fluid reserves of vapor-dominated geothermal reservoirs may be larger by a factor of about 2 than has generally been believed in the past.","","","Earth Sciences Division, Lawrence Berkeley Laboratory, Berkeley, California 94720","","","United States","1982-11-10T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: J.

The model has been applied to the hydrothermal system at Susanville, California. A reasonable match with the areal temperature distribution in the primary aquifer and the temperature profiles of individual wells was obtained. This allowed an estimate of the recharge rate from the fault into the hydrothermal system to be obtained. As the calculated recharge rate (9 x 10/sup -6/ m/sup 3//s m) into the Susanville hydrothermal system proved to be quite significant, a threefold increase in the potential of the Susanville hydrothermal anomaly for space heating purposes is predicted.","","","Earth Sciences Division, Lawerence Berkeley Laboratory, Berkeley, California 94720","","","United States","1982-11-10T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: J.

In 1981, 99 wells accounted for 64,781 ft of hole. A total of 203,673 ft of hole was cut during the drilling of 37 geothermal exploratory wells. California again had the largest number of wildcats at 16, followed by Nevada with 10. Eight successful wildcats accounted for 34,862 ft of hole, with an average total depth of 4358 ft. These include wells capable of producing dry and wet steam, as well as ones intended for direct-use applications. Of the 62 geothermal development wells in 1981, representing 471,108 ft of hole, 56 were considered capable of production. Also, there has been a significant increase in average depth, from 5997 ft in 1980 to 7901 ft in 1981. Although there have been no new geothermal electrical power plants brought on-line in The Geysers during 1981, construction continued on 6 plants, with a combined capacity of 537 MWe, scheduled to become operational during 1982 through 1984. A strong trend is emerging in the area of power generation from geothermal resources: the development of small power plants (i.e., those of 1.5 to 20 MWe capacity). Two small facilities, 1 of 3 MWe at the Puna District in Hawaii and 1 of 1.6 MWe at the Roosevelt Hot Springs KGRA in Utah, became operational in 1981. This movement toward smaller, semiportable, less expensive power plants is healthy, and is indicative of the desire of utilities and geothermal operators to solve their mutual problems. With the approval for 2 new electrical transmission lines, a major impediment to the eventual development of geothermal resources in The Geysers and the Imperial Valley has been removed. The construction of district heating projects highlights direct-use applications of geothermal energy in 1981.","","","","","","United States","1982-11-01T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: Am.

Two of the wildcats discovered new oil fields and 6 found new gas fields. An additional gas find has been treated as a discovery because of its stratigraphic significance. Onshore development drilling included 2078 wells; 97% of these were completed as successful producers, the same percentage as in 1980. For the California offshore, just 5 exploratory well completions were reported to the Committee on Statistics of Drilling in 1981; only 2 were successful. Texaco announced its Pitas Point gas field extension in May, and Chevron announced a new oil field discovery, the Point Arguello, in October. There were 118 development wells drilled, of which 99 (83.9%) were successful. Development footage and number of wells were up, but the percentage of success declined from 90% in 1980. California's oil production reached an all-time high of 384.8 million bbl in 1981. The state's previous record, set in 1968, was 375.4 million bbl. Geothermal activity in California centered on development of the proven Imperial Valley and Geysers areas and the discovery of the Coso area in Inyo County. Activity in Oregon included evaluation of the Mount Hood and Newberry Volcano areas. Oil and gas exploratory drilling in Oregon druing 1981 led to the discovery of a new gas field by American Quasar in Linn County and to the establishment of a new gas pool by Reichhold Energy at the Mist field in Columbia County. The major portion of Washington's exploratory drilling in 1981 was carried out by Shell in Kittitas County in the south-central part of the state.

The evening imagery, which utilized density-slicing techniques, detected thermal anomalies associated with geothermal heat sources. The study indicates that high-altitude predawn thermal imagery may be able to locate relatively large areas of hot ground in site-specific studies in the vegetated Alaskan terrain.

Heated lighter water, rising in the fault, is assumed to charge a reservoir which, in turn, is overlain by a thin, impermeable, thermally conducting cap rock. The mass flow rate or the pressure associated with the charging process at the fault inlet is unknown and can only be estimated. Thus in this paper the pressure in the fault at the bottom of the reservoir is assumed to be presented. Quasianalytic solutions for the velocity, pressure, and temperature are obtained in the fault-reservoir system for a high Rayleigh number flow. In this approximation, the upwelling fluid does not cool off appreciably until it reaches the cold upper boundary of the reservoir and encounters conductive heat loss. This thermal boundary layer, which is thin at the top of the fault, grows outward laterally and occupies the full thickness of the aquifer far away from the faults. The mathematical model is based on the flow of liquid water in a saturated porous medium. The solution techniques involve the combination of perturbation methods, boundary layer theory, and numerical methods. The analysis of this generic model can be applied to liquid-dominated geothermal systems where the thickness of the impermeable cap rock is very small compared to the depth of the reservoir.","","","Earth Sciences Division, Lawrence Berkeley Laboratory, University of California, Berkeley, California 94720","","","United States","1982-10-10T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: J.

The data indicate that significant changes in the chemistry are cyclical. Enrichments in Na, Ca, SiO/sub 2/, Cl and SO/sub 4/ are accompanied by sympathetic increases in surface temperatures and flow rates suggesting that mixing is the major process controlling the cyclic nature of these various parameters. In spite of these chemical variations, major cation ratios remain remarkably constant assuring the applicability of cation geothermometers regardless of the time of year. Major inflow of diluting groundwaters occurs on a regular basis every two to six months. The delta/sup 34/S values of aqueous sulfates and sulfides indicate that these constituents are probably derived from dissolution of marine sulfates and pyrite contained in sedimentary rocks at depth. Sulfur isotopic fractionation between sulfates and sulfides is very near equilibrium (90%) with minimum estimated temperatures ranging from 211/sup 0/-126/sup 0/C.

Their rise is hindered at a certain level by the volcanic products thermselves. The fluid flow is thus forced to alter course along transverse NNW-SSE faults which intercept the Boundary Faults beneath the volcanics and, to a lesser extent, along fractured horizons of the Ahuachapan Andesites. The fluids veer northwards along these new channelways, moving along two major NNW-SSE faults, with minor flows along other parallel faults and along the horizon of Ahuachapan Andesites. As the masses move north, a further hindrance is caused by an E-W fault acting both as a barrier to the northerly flow and as a channelway to any E-W an W-E flows. The result is that the water masses mix along this EW fault plane and its parallel equivalents. Reduced in mass and temperature, the fluid finds further conduits to the north along other open sections of the NNW-SSE faults. The flow is finally hindered by ever decreasing opening size along the faults and by an opposed influx of cold waters from the north.","","","ELC-Electroconsult, Milano","","","United States","1982-10-01T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: Trans. - Geotherm.

This approach focuses on enhancing a community's local economy by developing its geothermal resources to attract industries which need a low-cost reliable energy source. Twenty-seven areas of the state met strict geologic and economic criteria and are considered priority areas for immediate development activities. Twenty end-use applications, such as district heating and agricultural processes (e.g. greenhouse heating), met economic and energy use criteria and can successfully convert to using geothermal energy.

The results obtained using the model show that initially the cold water will move very rapidly through the fracture system away from the well. Later on, conductive heat transfer from the rock matrix blocks will retard the advancement of the cold water front, and eventually uniform energy sweep conditions will prevail. Where uniform energy sweep conditions are reached the cold water movement away from the injection well will be identical to that in a porous medium; consequently maximum energy recovery from the rock matrix will be attained.

A sensitivity of measurement of 0.001/sup 0/C was maintained to the bottom of the well (165/sup 0/C, 180 bars). Useable precision was limited by convective motions within the hole (0.01-0.3/sup 0/C depending on ambient geothermal gradient), fluid leakage through the lubricator at the well head (4 bars) and, occasionally, by electrical or electronic noise. Comparison of these continuous logs indicates a general warming in and just above the slotted interval (1647-1877 m) which is attributed to flow into the lower levels of the slotted interval and up the casing and out into permeable zones at higher levels. Some flow continued upward through an uncemented interval of the annulus between casing and hole and out into the formation where it is blocked by cement ( about 1594 m). Some points of entrance or egress of fluid are marked by small, sharp temperature anomalies which have persisted over the 5-year period. Apparently, the uncemented part of the annulus has partly filled in, and flow into the bottom of slotted interval has increased (1978-1982). Both of these changes may have been induced by the nearby ( about 30 km) Imperial Valley earthquake of 10/15/79, or by the production or testing of nearby wells.","","","U.S. Geological Survey Federal Center, Denver, CO","","","United States","1982-10-01T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: Trans. - Geotherm.

The comparison of the calculated flow rate with the well known experiments of Russell James indicates that a constant factor of 1.11 makes a perfect match of both methods. Then, a very simple equation is proposed for the dry steam wells of Los Azufres using only lip pressure. The agreement with experimental values is excellent. The equation is extended to other dry steam fields. For wells having steam and water, the same equation can be used to calculate steam flow rate with reasonably good accuracy. However, for better precision, a very simple correction factor renders the equation exact. The proposed equations are extremely simple and as accurate as the traditional Russell James correlations.","","","Departamento de Proyectos de Geotermia Comision Federal de Electricidad Morelia, Michoacan","","","United States","1982-10-01T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: Trans. - Geotherm.

Silica in the brine was stable at a pH 7.5, however, at a pH above 9.5 deposition of silica was triggered in a brine disposal system and required abandonment of the hydrogen sulfide abatement process originally proposed for the brine system. The steam phase sulfide abatement system for standby conditions was 90% effective, although superheat in the treatment system reduced abatement efficiency. Brine carryover through the separator was very low; however, scale deposition on the turbine blades resulted in substantial damage to the turbine.

The bench scale studies further indicated that pilot plant testing would not need to include hydrogen peroxide to sulfide treatment ratios of greater than 4:1 and that lower ratios might be adequate.","","","Bechtel Group, Incorporated, Research and Engineering, San Francisco, California","","","United States","1982-10-01T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: IEEE Trans.

The authors report studies of microearthquakes occurring during two large (>10/sup 3/m/sup 3/) hydraulic stimulations of the hydrothermal reservoir at the Baca Location in the Jemez Mountains of Northeastern New Mexico. Both stimulations consisted of water, viscosity enhancer, and proppant. The microearthquake event rate was low but variable throughout most of the treatment. Rock failure as indicated by the distribution of the microearthquakes' foci appeared restricted to a nearly vertical NE striking zone. This orientation is in good agreement with the local earth stresses inferred from geological considerations. The second stimulation which occurred in a neighboring well was similar to the first except for a larger injected volume. The lateral extent of the detected fracture system was 600 m in both stimulations.","","","Los Alamos National Laboratory, Los Alamos, New Mexico","","","United States","1982-10-01T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: Trans. - Geotherm.

Lab tests are being confirmed by prolonged use in the field. Field experience confirms that in deep, hot, steam-injection wells and geothermal wells, packer reliability is poor. The problem usually is caused by degradation of the packer seal while other parts of the packer (slips, etc.) seem to work well. Seal failure generally occurs because conventional seal materials degrade at high temperature and thus deform and distort under pressure. Such failure is hastened by transient loading (thermal cycling) that occurs, for instance, due to periodic interruptions in the steam supply.","","","","","","United States","1982-10-01T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: World Oil; (United States); Journal Volume: 195:5","","Medium: X; Size: Pages: 143-144","","","","Journal ID: CODEN: WOOIA","","","2009-12-16T00:00:00Z","5633383","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/5633383","","World Oil; (United States)","","195:5"

The method involves utilizing a Reactor-Clarifier machine to reduce silica to the saturation point without addition of chemicals. Simultaneously, scaling was prevented by using the internally recycled solids as seed for crystal growth. By recirculating thickened solids to the pressure flash vessels and crystallizers employed for steam generation, scaling can be eliminated. Pressure filtration can be used to produce dewatered solids which can be disposed of in an environmentally acceptable way. Spent brine clarified by granular dual-media filters can be reinjected into the formation at a reasonably constant volumetric rate per unit of pressure drop. Inorganic by-products from the spent brine could be produced. Suggests that air-brine contact be prevented for brine reinjection to prevent precipitation of such compounds as ferric hydroxide.

From this data, we believe the Ojo Caliente system is suitable only for small-scale direct use geothermal applications.","","","Earth and Space Sciences Division, Los Alamos National Laboratory, Los Alamos, New Mexico","","","United States","1982-10-01T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: Trans. - Geotherm.

Warm springs have deltaD values (128 to -137 permil) significantly lower than those of cold springs to the north and east of the area, but similar to the deltaD values of cold springs to the west and south (-131 to -135 permil). The recharge area for the warm springs is unlikely to be to the immediate north, which is the local topographic highland in the area. The hydrogen isotope data would permit recharge from areas to the southwest or from high elevations to the southeast (Independence Mountains), a sector consistent with electrical resistivity evidence of fluid flow. Warm springs are HCO/sub 3//sup -/-rich waters, enriched by a factor of 3 to 10 in Na, HCO/sub 3//sup -/ and SiO/sub 2/ relative to local cold springs. Average quartz (no steam loss) and Na/K/Ca geothermometer estimates suggest subsurface temperatures of 145/sup 0/ and 196/sup 0/C, respectively. The warm springs exhibit poor correlations between either hydrogen or oxygen isotope composition and water temperature or chemistry. The absence of such correlations suggests that there is no single coherent pattern of cold water mixing or evaporation in the thermal spring system.","","","Dept. of Geology and Geophysics, Univ. of Utah, Salt Lake City, UT","","","United States","1982-10-01T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: Trans. - Geotherm.

Typical temperatures of 350 to 700/sup 0/F (177 to 371/sup 0/C) damage the elastomers and create other operating problems, reducing the life of the motors and their ability to drill efficiently. Recent innovations in turbodrill design have opened heretofore unrealized potentials and have allowed, for the first time, extended downhole drilling time in hot-hole conditions. The unique feature of this turbodrill is the lack of any elastomers or other temperature-sensitive materials. Its capabilities are matched closely to the requirements of drilling in elevated-temperature environments. The bearing assembly can withstand conditions encountered in typical geothermal formations and provides the performance necessary to stay in the hole. The result is increased rate of penetration (ROP) and more economical drilling.","","","","","","United States","1982-10-01T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: J. Pet.

The area lies at the edge of a tecto-volcanic depression where some 1,000 m of Tertiary and Quaternary volcanics are underlain by a granodioritic basement. High temperature geothermal fluids (over 280/sup 0/C) reach the field from the west, upflowing along the inclined contact between the granodioritic and the overlying volcanics, and along fractures in the basement itself. A conglomeratic layer at the volcanics/basement contact, and the underlying weathered cap of the basement form the only permeable horizon of the succession; this horizon forms the local reservoir tapped by the productive wells. Its reduced thickness (around 50 m) allows for a limited fluid storage such that field production relies on external recharge along the permeable horizon and underlying fractures in the granodiorite. Production testing and simulation models indicate a fairly rapid evolution of reservoir conditions from the liquid to the steam phase, due to pressure drawdown, in its turn due to a restricted inflow. The phenomenon determines an upgrading of the fluid enthalpy, but a decline of mass output. Simulated reinjection into the reservoir proved to be an effective measure to slow down such an evolution and optimize the field exploitation.","","","INDE, Instituto Nacional de Electrificacion, Guatemala, Central America","","","United States","1982-10-01T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: Trans. - Geotherm.

The calculated results suggest that two-phase condition is dominant at the well inlet which means the geothermal fluid starts flashing in the reservoir and enter the wellbore as two-phase mixture. Well inlet steam quality are not uniform but differs widely in the range from 0.1 to 0.7. Two wells intersecting the fracture at shallow zone of the reservoir show the steam of high quality more than 0.5 and increase with time. Large increase in well inlet pressure explains that flash point moves into the wellbore from the reservoir due the decrease in saturation pressure which may account for the effects of mixing of reinjection water.","","","Research Institute of Industrial Science, Kyushu University Sakamoto Kasuga City","","","United States","1982-10-01T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: Trans. - Geotherm.

A broad fault zone with associated fracturing occurs at approximately 5300'-5335' and serves as the main production zone. Well testing has indicated a highly productive well with no immediate boundaries. Long term testing was conducted at a constant artesian flow rate of 670 gpm with a maximum downhole temperature during flow of 251 F. The thermal fluid is a Na-SO/sub 4/-Cl type of low salinity.

The temperature gradient data have been processed using a newly developed wave number filtering technique with the following results: The technique is very effective in locating the top of the geothermal reservoir where the temperature gradient begins to decrease. This cannot be accomplished using traditional techniques of processing thermal data such as direct extrapolation or downward continuation. The technique predicts realistic temperatures to a depth of at least 4000 feet (1300 m). Since the data base generally represents only the upper 250 feet (75 m) of section, this represents a large extrapolation in a very thermally complex regime.

The method, called ''Circular Vertical Soundings'' (C.V.S.) is useful in determining the predominant orientation of deep fracturing of rocks and of their schistosity. In geothermal studies it is particularly useful to know the direction or directions of the predominant basement fracture systems since these could be the conduits responsible for the flow of hot fluids. The method is based on the Quadripole Schlumberger Technique, and in practice one carries out 4 to 6 vertical electrical soundings (V.E.S.) with the same centre but different azimuth (say every 30-45/sup 0/), thereby permitting one to measure the relationship between apparent resistivity and azimuth; results are plotted on polar diagrams. The validity of the method is demonstrated through its application to the Dhamar-Rada'a (Y.A.R.) geothermal area, where four C.V.S. were carried out together with 83 conventional V.E.S.","","","ELC-Electroconsult, Milano","","","United States","1982-10-01T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: Trans. - Geotherm.

The study compares the costs, composed of the equipment investment cost and the increased payment to steam suppliers, with the benefits, composed primarily of displacing existing oil-fired generation and cost savings due to geothermal fuel repricing. Two alternative oil cost real escalation rates were examined: 4.7 percent through 1987 and 3.0 percent thereafter, and a zero escalation rate throughout. The analysis found for the higher oil price escalation case that the present value of future savings was about $17,000/kW of improved efficiency at a cost of $6,000/kW. Under the lower oil price escalation case, the present value of future savings was less than the investment. Whether or not improving the efficiency of geothermal units is a profitable investment is almost totally determined by future oil prices, given the resource plan used in the analysis.","","","Technology Assessments Office, Assessments Division, California Energy Commission","","","United States","1982-10-01T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: IEEE Trans.

The measurements were made in a small diameter (6.2 cm I.D.) tubing capped at the bottom and extending from the surface to near total depth in the hole which ranged in diameter down to 20 cm. A 34 cm (O.D.) casing was cemented into place in the upper 901 m of the hole. The remainder of the hole was open, allowing the exchange of fluids among the many permeable zones encountered during drilling. Analysis of the temperature logs suggest the following: The linearity of the temperature plot in the interval 200-900 m (after allowing for decay of the drilling disturbance) suggests the existance of a hydrothermal system of considerable antiquity (> 10/sup 3/ years). The high gradient ( about180/sup 0/C/Km) and high heat flow (> 5 microcal/cm/sup 2/ . sec) in this interval require that heat be transported convectively to the base of this interval. The interval between about 900 and 1300 m exhibits anomalous warming since drilling. Although some of this warming represents decay of the thermal disturbance due to invasion of cool drilling fluids, a part of it may represent an invasion of hot water into the hole which then descends along the hole and exits into many permeable zones at greater depth. This could, of course, obscure the true nature of the thermal regime of the rocks surrounding the lower part of the hole.","","","U.S. Geological Survey Menlo Park, California","","","United States","1982-10-01T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: Trans. - Geotherm.

Fluids at the western end of the reservoir appear to have evolved principally through mixing of the deep fluid with dilute recharge, whereas along the eastern fringe of the central area mixing has followed concentration by boiling. The least evolved fluids are tapped by wells which lie along a N-S trend which enters the central part of the reservoir from the south. This trend is fairly well defined by contours of the chemical geothermometers, Na/K, and Cl.

These investigations have also delineated several problem areas. For example, CO/sub 2/ scaling problems may occur; porosity and permeability are reduced when the pore pressure of the sandstones is decreased and creep behavior is associated with these reductions (the resulting production-dependent skin effect and creep tendency suggest that existing reservoir models are inadequate); salinities are highly variable and far greater than those predicted by well-log analysis - consequently, water saturations are generally much too high. It is suggested that (1) additional well tests be made at high flow rates for assessing this energy source and (2) an increased emphasis be placed on shallow hydropressured aquifers and watered-out gas reservoirs.","","","Univ. of Texas, Austin","","","United States","1982-09-01T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: J.

Our reservoir model is a schematic representation of the Olkaria field in Kenya. The model consists of a two-phase vapordominated zone overlying the main liquid-dominated reservoir. Four different cases were studied, with fluid produced from: (1) the vapor zone only, (2) the liquid zone only, (3) both zones, and (4) both zones but with lower values for vertical permeability and porosity assumed. The results indicate that production from the shallow two-phase zone, although resulting in higher enthalpy fluids, may not be advantageous in the long run. Shallow production gives rise to a rather localized depletion of the reservoir, whereas production from deeper horizons may yield a more uniform depletion process if vertical permeability is sufficiently large. The exploitation from deeper zones causes boiling and subsequent upflow of steam that condenses at shallow depths. This tends to make temperatures and pressures more uniform throughout the reservoir, resulting in maximum energy recovery.","","","Lawrence Berkeley Laboratory","","","United States","1982-09-01T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: J.

Whole rock samples from these three localities have delta/sup 18/O values averaging +3.9 +- 1.3, +2.4 +- 1.1, and -7.7 +- 2.4%, respectively. The observed values in the deeper samples from Krafla are as low as the values for any rocks previously reported. There seems to be a slight negative gradient in delta/sup 18/O with depth at the former two localities and a more pronounced one at Krafla. Oxygen isotope fractionations between epidote and quartz and those between calcite and fluid suggests that the basalts were altered at temperatures of 300/sup 0/--400/sup 0/C. Low deltaD and delta/sup 18/O of epidote and low delta/sup 34/S of anhydrite indicate that the altering fluids in all three areas originated as meteoric waters and have undergone varied 'oxygen shifts'. Differences in the /sup 18/O shift of the fluids are attributed to differences in hydrothermal systems; low water/rock ratios (< or =0.1) are found in the IRDP core and the Reykjavik hole, but high water/rock ratios (>5) at Krafla. The convective hydrothermal activity, which is probably driven by silicic magma beneath the central volcanoes, has caused strong subsolidus depletion of /sup 18/O in the rocks. The primary-magnetic delta/sup 18/O value of the rocks in the Tertiary IRDP core was about +3.9%, which is lower than that obtained for fresh basalt from other places. Such exceptionally low delta/sup 18/O magmas are common in Iceland and may occur as the result of oxygen isotope exchange with or assimilation of altered rocks that form a thick sequence beneath the island due to isostatic subsidence.","","","Department of Geology, University of Alberta, Edmonton, Alberta, Canada T6G 2E3","","","United States","1982-08-10T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: J.

Alteration and secondary mineralization are most intense in the flow top breccias where water/rock ratios are presumed to have been the highest. In the upper portion of the cored sequence (to a depth of about 1200 m) alteration is characterized by the deposition of clay minerals +- calcite +- quartz +- laumonite into open spaces such as vugs and vesicles. Low-temperature zeolites, such as stilbite, epistilbite, mordenite, and heulandite, are also present but are restricted to the upper 500 m of the drill core. Below 1200 m, alteration is characterized by the dissolution and replacement of both primary minerals and earlier authigenic minerals, followed by partial filling of dissolution cavities. Early mineral assemblages consist of epidote +- quartz +- prehnite +- albite, and a later superimposed assemblages consists of calcite+laumontite +- anhydrite. Authigenic sphene, pyrite, chalcopryite, pumpellyite, aceinolite, and wairakite also occur sporadically in the cored sequence. Secondary mineral assemblages and temperature measurements of fluid inclusions suggest a maximum temperature of alteration of about 300/sup 0/C.

The known hot water geothermal resource is found in Napa Valley in the vicinity of Calistoga along the apparent northeastern limb of this structure. Evidence from drilling in Napa Valley also indicates that hot water is present in certain permeable volcanic units at depth within these southwest-dipping beds. It is proposed that the hot water may originate either as meteoric water that enters permeable beds in the hills on the southwestern limb of the syncline or as juvenile or connate water that enters this structure from below. The hot water then rises to the surface in Napa Valley.

In the peripheral areas the most abundant authigenic minerals are quartz, calcite, chlorite, and sulfides. They formed in a temperature range of 150/sup 0/ to 250/sup 0/C and with a P /SUB co2/ range of 0.1 to 1.0 atm. In a hotter part of the field, at depths between 200 and 1,300 m, where the main productive fractures are located, the most important authigenic minerals are quartz, chlorite, calcite, K-feldspar, and K-bearing mica, with which wairakite, hematite, anhydrite, and barite are sometimes associated. Deposition of all these minerals occurs in a temperature range of 200/sup 0/ to 300/sup 0/C under P /SUB co2/ of about 1 atm, and relatively high P /SUB o2/, in fluids sometimes characterized by silica oversaturation. Below the 1,300-m depth in the hottest part of the field K-feldspar, chlorite, epidote, sulfides with minor sphene, prehnite, clinopyroxene, and clinoamphibole are present. These minerals form in a temperature range of 250/sup 0/ to 350/sup 0/C under a P /SUB co2/ of less than 1 atm and a P /SUB o2/ ranging from 10/sup -40/ to 10/sup -33/ atm and reasonably reflect the physicochemical parameters of the geothermal fluid before exploitation. Evidence of an earlier hydrothermal stage characterized by higher temperatures can be seen in the occurrence of relic wollastonite and andradite.","","","Centro di Studio per la Geologia dell'Italia Centrale, C.

The injections were part of a program to increase the heat transfer area of hydraulic fractures and to decrease the flow-through impedance between wells in the energy extraction system under construction. The microearthquakes were used in mapping the location of the extended hydraulic fractures. The large shear- to compressional-wave-amplitude ratio observed in the signals suggests that the microearthquakes result from shear failure, probably on preexisting planes of weakness that intersect or make up the main hydraulic system. Failure resulting from increased pore pressure is a likely cause for the microearthquakes. Knowledge of the failure criterion for the reservoir rocks permits calculation of the pore pressure increases necessary for failure. At Fenton Hill, it appears that pressures 2 Pa (0.00029 psi) above hydrostatic are necessary. For this hypothesis of microearthquake occurrence to hold, the effective reservoir permeability must be four orders of magnitude above that for the bulk rock, as would be the case if there were permeable joints or fractures in the reservoir before hydraulic stimulation.","","","Los Alamos Natl.

RTD techniques using sodium fluorescein and Br/sup 82/ tracers were developed to estimate overall fracture volumes, overall levels of dispersed mixing, and individual flow path characteristics. Observed levels of mixing are much higher than would be expected for purely hydrodynamic dispersion in nearly potential or steady laminar flow in a flat fracture between injection and production wells. Variable residence times caused by a complex distribution of crack apertures may control the overall RTD in a completely convectively dominated system. Geophysical, geometric, and flow data and 1- and 2D dispersion analyses were combined to develop plausible reservoir models for hydraulically fractured HDR systems. Models developed are consistent with major observations from extensive field tests including estimates of effective heat transfer area, thermal drawdown and recovery temperature logs, flow impedances, and reservoir geochemistry. Because of the complex relationship between geometric factors (fracture roughness, primary and secondary flow paths through propped joints, dead-end pore volume and other stagnation regions) and the physical phenomena controlling convective circulation and dispersion, a unique model to describe flow and mixing cannot be determined.","","","Los Alamos Natl.

Summation of the depth-dependent terms produces a total cost per foot that is constant over the range of depths likely in eastern operations. These observations lead to the following formula for estimating the cost of a single-production-well/single-disposal well geothermal system in 1980 dollars: cost = 380 + (110 x production depth) + (85 x disposal depth), where costs are in thousands of dollars and depths are in thousands of feet. When estimating the cost of a disposal well, it is conservative to assume that the spent geotherml fluids will be reinjected into their original formation. In many instances, however, it may be possible to use shallower formations for disposal. Pumping costs, which depend on well productivity, may heavily influence the economics of a potential geothermal project. Because well performance is difficult to predict, conservative feasibility studies should acknowledge that up to 700 kW of power may be consumed in circulating geothermal fluids through a production/disposal system. The cost-depth relationship derived here for eastern operations is significantly different from industry's experience in the west. In the western U.S., geothermal service contractors are in place, so setup costs are less and therefore shallow wells cost less. However, the drilling environment is generally more severe, causing western drilling costs to overtake eastern costs as drilling depth increases.","","","Operations, Gruy Federal, Inc.

It is suggested that, because the amount of fluid expansion is very small with temperature increase, typical hydraulic conductivities of clay rocks can accommodate the removal of this excess fluid in the time span available; thus it would appear that expansion of waters cannot contribute to the geopressure generating process. Lithologies of effectively zero permeabilities, however, may provide adequate sealing of contained pore fluids so that pressures increase with increasing temperature. The subsequent rupturing of the matrix, as pore pressures reach overburden pressures (particularly rapidly at shallow depths), produces fractures which may later provide routes for hydrocarbon migration. As a pressure transition zone cannot exist due to the necessary ''isolation'' of pore fluids, current geopressure evaluation techniques are limited in their application such that only flowline temperature interpretation may indicate subsequent penetration of an aquathermally generated geopressure. If a transition zone does exist above a geopressured interval, then some process other than aquathermal pressuring must have been instrumental.","","","Exploration Logging, Inc., Sacramento, CA","","","United States","1982-07-01T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: Am.

At these pressures all plagioclase compositions from approx.An/sub 40/ to An/sub 100/ break down along the same P-T curve as pure anorthite, which can be described by the equation P = -4590 + 20.4T(P = bars, T = /sup 0/C).

In the regions beneath the curves, the composition of sodic plagioclase along the down-dipping limb is in equilibrium with Zo + Ky + Qz.

Some of the geothermal brine waters (GBW) contain >30% total dissolved solids, mainly as NaCl, CaCl/sub 2/, and KCl, as well as several heavy metals such as Zn, Pb, Cu, and Cd. An investigation was undertaken to determine the mobility of Cd(II), Cu(II), and Zn(II) present in GBW through five agricultural soils. Columns of soils were leached with GBW collected from a well near the Salton Sea in California. The concentrations of Cd(II), Cu(II), Pb(II), and Zn(II) in the effluent were compared with their original concentrations to determine amounts of adsorption or retention in the soils. Heavy metal determinations also were made on whole soils before and after treatment. An estimate of the extent of Cl/sup -/ complexation with the metals was made from thermodynamic stability constants by use of the computer program GEOCHEM. Significant quantities (50-100%) of all heavy metals studied were complexed with Cl/sup -/. None of the soils adsorbed Cu(II) from the GBW, while Cd(II) was apparently removed from some soils. All soils adsorbed some Pb(II) and Zn(II), but after passing 10 pore volumes of solution their capacity for adsorption was negligible. A combination of mass action and Cl/sup -/ complexation most likely caused the high mobility of Cd(II), Cu(II), Pb(II), and Zn(II) in the GBW.","","","Univ. of California, Berkeley","","","United States","1982-07-01T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: J.

A small fraction of the shear may be occurring as permanent aseismic creep, which is being converted to stick-slip movement in the Geysers reservoir due to steam production. Two mechanisms could be responsible for the induced seismicity: a large (>100 bars) increase in effective rock pressure; and an increase in the coefficient of friction. The first mechanism requires that the initial state of the reservoir be predominantly liquid-dominated. The second mechanism is a consequence of dehydration of the reservoir causing both the 'hardening' of clay and fault gouge, and the precipitation of silica.","","","Geophysics Div., D.S.I.R., Private Bag, Taupo, New Zealand","","","United States","1982-06-01T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: Geophys.

This situation suggests that air quality regulations would not impede the development of geothermal energy resources. However, an in-depth study of the Clean Air Act and state air quality regulations has determined that such regulations have constrained geothermal development in the past, based on hydrogen sulfide (H/sub 2/S) emissions from geothermal power plants. The ''federal enforceability'' provision of PSD regulations has caused some geothermal plants with controlled emissions at low levels to undergo PSD review, thus extending the time needed for permit approval. To determine the potential effects of air quality regulations upon future geothermal energy development, Federal PSD and non-attainment regulations are examined. The proximity of known geothermal resource areas to Class I PSD areas and non-attainment areas are determined. Atmospheric modeling of H/sub 2/S emissions from a hypothetical geothermal plant finds that if recently available control equipment is installed, H/sub 2/S emissions do not constrain geothermal development.","","","Oak Ridge National Laboratory, Oak Ridge, Tennessee","","","United States","1982-06-01T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: Proc., Annu.

Wellbore storage is taken into account, and the duration of it is estimated. It is shown that the wellbore flow can dominate the downhole pressure signal completely such that large h changes in the downhole pressure that might be expected because of changes in kinematic mobility are not seen. Changes in the flowing enthalpy from the reservoir can interact with the wellbore flow so that a temporary plateau in the downhole transient curve is measured. Application of graphical and nongraphical methods to determine reservoir parameters from drawdown tests is demonstrated. 22 refs.","","","Lawrence Berkeley Lab, CA, USA","","","United States","1982-06-01T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: SPEJ, Soc.

The resource base will continue to grow due to exploration and research. In spite of negative factors such as increased energy conservation, use of coal, oil price stabilization or decrease, nuclear plants coming on line, gas discoveries, and lack of appropriately experienced personnel and research, the author sees 6000 to 8000 MW on line by 1995, and double that - should another energy crisis occur.

The Phase I or Research system is a closed, recirculating, pressurized water loop. Cool water injected through one well is heated as it circulates through hydraulically induced fractures in hot granite rock (197/sup 0/C) at a depth of approximately 2590m. It is recovered through a second well as superheated water, pressurized to prevent boiling. Its useful heat is removed in heat exchangers at the surface, and the cooled water is reinjected through the first well to recirculate repeatedly through the underground fracture system. A Phase II or Engineering system has been designed and is now under construction. The two wells were completed in a parallel configuration to allow fracturing between well bores at various locations. This increase in fracture surface area will provide more heat over the life of the project and enhance its economics.

Mg/sub 2/SiO/sub 4/ is diamagnetic, and its heat capacity follows a normal sigmoidal curve at low temperatures. Co/sub 2/SiO/sub 4/ shows a single sharp lambda-type transition at 49.85 +/- 0.02 K associated with the antiferromagnetic ordering of the magnetic moments of the Co/sup 2 +/ ions into a collinear spin arrangement below 49.8 K. In contrast to Co/sub 2/SiO/sub 4/ Mn/sub 2/siO/sub 4/ has two transitions in C/sup o//sub p/, a sharp lambda-type transition at 47.38 +/- 0.05 K and a smaller ''shoulder'' in C/sup o//sub p/ centered near 12 K. The upper transition corresponds to the paramagnetic (disordered) to collinear antiferromagnetic ordering of the Mn/sup 2 +/ moments, whereas the shoulder near 12 K corresponds to the change from the collinear to a canted spin structure. Our calorimetric values for the antiferromagnetic-paramagnetic transition temperature (Neel Temperature) are in excellent agreement with those obtained by powder magnetic susceptibility measurements, 49 +/- 2 K and 50 +/- 5 K for Co/sub 2/SiO/sub 4/ and Mn/sub 2/SiO/sub 4/ respectively.

Hood region in the last 15 m.y. shows a slow migration of six to eight volcanic centers from a position about 20 km west of Mt. Hood to the most recent volcanic center in the series. Cutting across the entire Mt. Hood region and most of the Pacific Northwest is a set of northwest-southeast right-lateral strike-slip faults. These are numerous around Mt. Hood, but the offset of any single fault is small (a few meters) and in some cases vertical. These faults are also young and indicate east-west extension and north-south compression. An older and probably inactive set of northeast-southwest folds and thrust faults is evident in the region, particularly in the Miocene Columbia River Basalt Group. These may be related to a long history of north-south compression. The volcanic history and structure are presumably a result of subduction of the Juan de Fuca plate beneath the North American plate. This subduction is oblique, leading to a substantial component of right-lateral motion which, in turn, leads to north-south compression in the Pacific Northwest. Crustal thinning associated with volcanism has resulted in an elevated geothermal gradient around Mt. Hood. This high gradient makes it possible to tap water in excess of 80 /sup 0/C within 1500 m of the surface. If these thermal waters can be produced in large volumes, they might provide a substantial amount of economically competitive energy for space heating and industrial processes, in the region adjacent to the Cascades. A simple geothermal resource calculation shows that a 1000 km/sup 2/ area around Mt. Hood could produce beneficial heat which, if supplied by electricity, would require over 1000 MW for 30 years.","","","U.S. Geological Survey, Denver, Colorado 80225","","","United States","1982-04-10T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: J.

Recent crustal uplift along the northeast trending axis of the caldera is at a maximum (700 mm since 1923) near the Mud Volcano area. From 1973 through April 1978, less than 10 earthquakes (largest M 2.4) were located within 3 km of the Mud Volcano area. In May 1978, earthquakes began occurring beneath the hydrothermal area at depths of 1 to 5 km. The seismic activity continued until the end of November with intense swarms (100 events per hour) occurring on October 23 and November 7. The largest event (M 3.1) occured on November 14 and at least 8 events were M 2.5 or larger. In December 1978, heat flux in the Mud Volcano hydrothermal features began increasing along a 2-km-long northeast trending zone. Existing mud cauldrons became more active, new mud cauldrons and fumeroles were formed, and vegetation (primarily lodgepole pine) was killed by increased soil temperature. The increase in heat flux continued through July 1979 then gradually declined, reaching the early 1978 level by June 1980. The spatial and temporal association of earthquakes and increased hydrothermal activity at Mud Volcano suggests that the seismic activity expanded preexisting fracture systems, premitting increased fluid flow from depths of several kilometers.","","","U.S. Geological Survey, Menlo Park, California 94025","","","United States","1982-04-10T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: J.

The purpose of the geophysical study on INEL was to investigate the facility for a possible site to drill a geothermal exploration well. The initial interpretation of the MT sounding data was done with one-dimensional models consisting of four or five layers, the minimum number required to fit the data. After the test well (INEL-1) was completed, the electric log was used to guide an improved one-dimensional ID interpretation of the MT sounding data. Profile models derived from the well log provided good agreement with velocity models derived from refraction seismic data. A resolution study using generalized inverse techniques shows that the resolution of resistive layers in the lower part of the MT models is poor, as is the definition of a shallow, altered basalt unit. The only major structure observed on the MT data was the faulted contact between the SNRP and basin and range structures on the west. Modeling of the data near this structure with a two-dimensional computer program showed that the MT data near the fault require a model similar to the seismic refraction models and that structure on a deep crustal conductor is also required.","","","U.

Thirty-eight tensor magnetotelluric (MT) and remote telluric stations were set up in clusters around the volcano except for the northwest quadrant, a wilderness area. Because of limited access, station locations were restricted to elevations below 1829 m. On the basis of the MT results, three areas were later investigated in more detail using a large-moment, controlled-source electromagnetic (EM) system. One-dimensional interpretations of EM and MT data on the northeast flank of the mountain near the Cloud Cap eruptive center and on the south flank near Timberline Lodge show a similar subsurface resistivity pattern: a resistive surface layer 400--700 m thick, underlain by a conductive layer with variable thickness and resistivity of <20 ohm m. It is speculated that the surface layer consists of volcanics partially saturated with cold meteoric water. The underlying conductive zone is presumed to be volcanics saturated with water heated within the region of the central conduit and, possibly, at the Cloud Cap side vent. This hypothesis is supported by the existence of warm springs at the base of the mountain, most notably Swim Warm Springs on the south flank, and by several geothermal test wells, one of which penetrates the conductor south of Timberline Lodge. The mT data typically gave a shallower depth to the conductive zone than did the Em data. On the other hand, MT was better for resolving the thickness of the conductive layer and deeper structure. The MT data show evidence for a moderately conductive north-south structure on the south flank below the Timberline Lodge and for a broad zone of late Tertiary intrusives concealed on the southeast flank.","","","Earth Sciences Division, Lawrence Berkeley Laboratory, University of California, Berkeley, California 94720","","","United States","1982-04-10T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: J.

Hood in April 1973 and 9200 m/sup 2/ in September 1977, as determined by aerial infrared line scan surveys. The distribution of thermal anomalies below the summit of Mt. Hood suggests structural control by a fracture system and a brecciated zone peripheral to a young hornblende-dacite plug dome and by a concentric fracture system associated with the development of the present crater. We estimate a heat discharge of 5 to 10 MW from the extent and temperature of the thermal areas, including a heat loss of 2--4 MW via conduction, diffusion, evaporation, and radiation to the atmosphere, and a somewhat less certain loss of 3--6 MW via fumarolic mass transfer and surface advection. Additional heat is transferred to groundwater. The first part of the estimate is based on two-point models for different radiant exitance and differential geothermal flux from heat balance of the ground surface and on a shallow temperature probe traverse across the Devils Kitchen fumarole field. Alternate methods for estimating volcanogenic flux that assume a quasi steady state heat flow yield values in the 5- to 12-MW range. The estimated heat loss due to cooling of the 220 +- 150 year old dacite plug dome is insufficient to account for the heat flux at the fumarole field. The heat source is judged to be deep seated.","","","U.S. Geological Survey, Denver, Colorado 80225","","","United States","1982-04-10T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: J.

(2) The restrictive impacts of minimum temperature upon geothermal energy development are felt in the earliest years following enactment of legislation. (3) The market impacts of proposed temperature-based definitions will vary markedly across states. These impacts result from the site-specific nature of the resources and users as well as existing energy-market conditions in each locale.

A number of geochemical investigations were made during that test to evaluate the open injection system. Concentrations of suspended solids in water from the power plant remained below detection limits throughout most of the testing period. Actual chemical conditions in the injection water were in general agreement with pre-test predictions, the major difference being that more CO/sub 2/ was lost than initially projected. Measurements made during a two-week injection test indicated that opening the injection system to the atmosphere may add to the quantity of chemical precipitates formed after injection; this is because of the CO/sub 2/ loss.

Both intact and 30/sup 0/ sawcut cylinders were deformed at confining pressures of 200-1000 bars, pore pressure of 30 bars and temperatures of 150/sup 0/ and 240/sup 0/C.Thin-section and X-ray analysis revealed that some borehole samples had undergone extensive alteration and recrystallization. Constant strain rate tests of 10/sup -4/ and 10/sup -6/ per sec gave a coefficient of friction of 0.68. Due to the highly fractured nature of the rocks taken from the production zone, intact samples were rarely 50% stronger than the frictional strength.This result suggests that the Geysers reservoir can support shear stresses only as large as its frictional shear strength. Velocity of p-waves (6.2 km/sec) was measured on one sample. Acoustic emission and sliding on a sawcut were related to changes in pore pressure. b-values computed from the acoustic emissions generated during fluid injection were typically about 0.55.

The implications of the Japanese reinjection experience are therefore of extreme importance to future liquid-dominated geothermal development. The major impact of the experience in these fields is that, with the exception of Otake, the reinjection wells show a rapid interference with the production wells.

A fault is viewed as a prefractured plane in the earth's crust and is modeled by an interface across which two elastic bodies contact with each other, where frictional forces against the relative movement between two surfaces of the interface are taken into account. Once fluid is injected between the two surfaces, the fault will be opened up over a region where the pressure acting on the fault plane before the injection is locally smaller than that on the neighboring regions. The size of the fluid-filled region is compared with that of a crack opened by a hydraulic pressure in a homogeneous medium to show that the fluid-filled region could be used as a reservoir for the extraction of geothermal heat. The resulting slip caused by the reduction of frictional forces due to the injection of fluid is analyzed by the use of two models, i.e., an interface with frictional resistance only and an interface with both frictional resistance and fracture toughness. It is shown that the two models do not exhibit any significant difference in the size of the slipped region when the fluid-filled region is of dimensions of practical interest.","","","Department of Mechanical Engineering, Tohoku University, Sendai 980, Japan","","","United States","1982-02-10T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: J.

The simplified version assumes that when the sample volume is much smaller than the reservoir volume, the fluid storage in a rock sample can be neglected and the pressure decay in the upstream reservoir can be approximated by an exponential function of time. The numerical version uses finite difference method to solve the differential equation of pressure decay and matches the observed pressure decay with the calculated decay curves. The pressure decay calculated by the numerical version is not generally a simple exponential function of time, as suggested by the simplified version. Our analyses show that the numerical version fits to the observed data very well. The permeability value determined by the simplified version tends to be greater than that determined by the numerical version. The difference in apparent permeability between the two depends on many factors such as rock properties (porosity and compressibility), sample size, reservoir volumes, etc. A relative fluid storage is used to illustrate the difference of these two approaches. For a relative fluid storage value of greater than 0.03, the difference in permeability between the two is more than 30%. For a system with a fluid storage of less than 0.01, these two versions agree with each other well.","","","Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory, University of California, Livermore, California 94550","","","United States","1982-02-10T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: J.

Interpretation of data from several reflection, transmission, and attenuation experiments using seismic probes in the frequency range from a few hundred to more than 10/sup 4/ Hz led us to postulate the existence of a highly complex fracture system consisting of major discrete vertical cracks intersected by several inclined joints which are surrounded by a large volume of rock containing small-scale cracks. We found an interesting coincidence between the mean square fluctuation of P arrival time and Q/sup -1/ of coda waves. Both are increased by nearly the same amount (35approx.40%) when fluid pressure in the reservoir is increased. Another coincidence is the scale length of the inhomogeneity of roughly 3 m obtained from the frequency dependence of attenuation and also from the spatial variation of P arrival time. These results suggest that the seismic attenuation in the fractured region is caused primarily by scattering.","","","Department of Earth and Planetary Sciences, Massachusetts Institute of Technology, Cambridge, Massachusetts 02139","","","United States","1982-02-10T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: J.

During injection, the cold water will advance along the fractures, gradually extract heat from the adjacent rock matrix, and eventually arrive at the production wells. If the injected water has not fully heated (up) by then, detrimental effects on energy production from decreasing fluid enthalpies may result. This indicates the need to establish criteria for designing an injection/production scheme for fractured geothermal reservoirs. The model considered in this work consists of an injection well fully penetrating a fractured geothermal reservoir containing equally spaced horizontal fractures. A constant-temperature liquid water is injected into the fractures, and with the rock matrix assumed to be impermeable, the effect of heat conduction on the advancement of the 'cold' water along the fractures is observed. Key dimensionless parameters that describe the physical system are identified and type curves are generated. These are intended to be used in the design of injection/production systems, mainly for determining the appropriate locations and the flow rates of the injection wells. Also, temperature contour maps are given, and these can be used to estimate the amount of recoverable energy from the geothermal system, based on a given injection/production scheme. Numerical studies are also made to investigate the importance of the assumptions in the analytical work and to extend the work to cases where the rock matrix is permeable. The results are intended to be used as a constraint on the results calculated using the type curves. Finally, two simple numerical examples using a hypothetical doublet and the Cerro Prieto geological model are given. In the doublet case, a reservoir with two to five fractures is considered, and breakthrough times of 13 and 65 years, respectively, are calculated.","","","Earth Sciences Division, Lawrence Berkeley Laboratory, Berkeley, California 94720","","","United States","1982-02-10T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: J.

This study was intended to provide the basis for designing active seismic experiments to detect the existence of hydraulically induced fractures in a Hot Dry Rock Geothermal energy system. Transmission and reflection coefficients for P, SV, and SH waves incident at arbitrary angles onto a fluid layer embedded between two homogeneous half-spaces were computed. It was found that coefficients for SH waves at normal incidence can be written in terms of two dimensionless parameters. One of these parameters, l, is the ration of acoustic impedance of the fluid to the acoustic impedance of the solid. The other dimensionless parameter, ..gamma..d, is a measure of the amount of energy the SH wave looses during one pass through the fluid layer. It was found that the amplitude of the incident SH transmitted through the fluid layer is equal to the amplitude of the incident SH wave if l is nearly 1 and ..gamma..d is small. As ..gamma..d increases, energy is lost due to viscous dissipation in the fluid and transmitted wave amplitude diminishes. If l is not nearly 1, some energy is reflected by the fluid layer. Three dimensionless parameters are required for solution for the case of P waves normally incident on the fluid layer. One parameter, R, is the ratio of elastic impedance of the solid to the shear impedance of the fluid and the third is ..gamma..d. It was found that the value of R is a good measure of the importance of fluid viscosity on the propagation of P waves through the fluid. Detailed studies of the effects of fluid and solid physical properties on the amplitudes of transmitted and reflected waves when waves are normally incident provide valuable insight into the importance of physical properties in the calculations for non-normal incidence.","","","Oregon State Univ., Corvallis","","","United States","1982-02-01T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: Bull.

In this study, drainage steam-water relative permeabilities were obtained from steady, 2-phase, nonisothermal bench scale flow experiments. Liquid-water saturations were measured along the length of synthetic sandstone cores using a capacitance probe. The internal gas-drive steam-water relative permeabilities were compared to external gas-drive, nitrogen-water relative permeabilities obtained at elevated temperature. Differences between the 2 sets of relative permeability curves suggests that for the synthetic cores used in this study, relative permeability is different for the internal gas drive and external gas drive processes. 20 references.","","","","","","United States","1982-01-01T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: Soc.

A detailed model of the photosynthesis and growth of sugar beets fumigated by H/sub 2/S and CO/sub 2/ and generalized from the model calculations to other crops was used. Model calculations were made with estimates of time series of expected ground-level concentrations of H/sub 2/S and CO/sub 2/ calculated by the air quality assessment element of the Imperial Valley Environmental Project (IVEP) at 22 locations around the valley. The model calculations also used time series data of meteorological variables such as air temperature, solar radiation, and relative humidity, which were measured by the air quality baseline element in the field of the Imperial Valley. Results indicate that, in the absence of interactions with other ambient pollutant gases, all location would experience an increase (from slight to significant) in total growth of sugar beets. Seven locations will experience an increase of at least 10%. The emissions rate at which negative effects cancel out the benefits of H/sub 2/S fertilization was calculated; in the worst case, emission rates are expected to be no more than 1/13 of this crossover rate. The expected emission rate will be less than that necessary for negative effects on the most sensitive species (such as alfalfa) by a factor of 4. Similar results for other crops are summarized in the report. If CO/sub 2/ emissions are increased proportionately, the dominance of deleterious effects is not expected to occur, even under maximum development as set forth in IVEP scenario projections. 8 figures, 6 tables.","","","Lawrence Livermore National Lab., CA","","","United States","1982-01-01T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: J.

While the possible value of minerals recovered would substantially exceed the revenue from power production, information is insufficient to carry out a detailed economic analysis. The recovery of precious metals - silver, gold and platinum - is the most important factor in determining the economics of a minerals recovery plant. However, the precious metal content of the brines is not certain. Such a power plant could recover 14 to 31% of the US demand for manganese and substantial amounts of zinc and lead. Previous work on minerals extraction from Salton Sea brines is reviewed and a new process, based on a fluidized-bed cementation reaction with metallic iron, is proposed.

The possibility of premature reservoir depletion and technological difficulties necessitates carefully drawn escape provisions. Responsibility for high-cost gathering systems and reinjection facilities must be determined. Complex pricing formulas may reflect distributions of risks between buyer and seller.

One-dimensional radial flow near an injection well is modeled to study in detail the propagation of hydrodynamic and temperature fronts. Gravity effects for injection into a thick 2-phase reservoir are studied with a vertical 2-dimensional mesh. Comparisons are made between shallow and deep injection. Mixed production/injection schemes are investigated for a 5-spot geometry using an areal 2-dimensional mesh. Production pressures and power output change little due to injection, whereas longevity of the field can be increased substantially.

A subset of 10 sites drilled specifically to characterize the heat flow of the region yielded a mean of 100 mW m/sup -2/ with a standard deviation of 22 mW m/sup -2/. A comparison of thermal conductivities of solid cylindrical discs and rock chips (rhyolite to andesite tuffs) confirmed the importance of porosity corrections to thermal conductivity measurements.

A partial melt zone was found to exist at depths between 58 m and 89 m consisting of 40 volume percent melt. Downhole seismic shots detonated in and below the melt zone resulted in the first in situ measurements of seismic velocity directly through well characterized partial melt zone. Periodic seismic sources were used to effectively penetrate the highly fractured hydrothermal zone of the lava lake crust. Low velocity P-wave layers (< or =2.0 km/s) were found at the surface, at 40 m depth, and at 90 m depth. Thermal convective experiments in the melt zone resulted in the first controlled in situ measurements of the interaction of water with a basaltic melt zone. Transient energy rates of 900 kW (980 kW/m/sup 2/) and steady rates of 85 kW (93 kW/m/sup 2/) were observed. The full water recovery (100%), high downhole steam temperatures (670 C), and high energy transfer rates (93 to 980 kW/m/sup 2/) observed in these thermal experiments are consistent with a closed cavity model where the injected water/steam directly contacted basaltic melt or near melt. In addition to understanding lava lakes, these seismic and thermal experiments have applications for the location of magma bodies in the crust and for the efficient extraction of energy from these bodies.","","","Geothermal Research Division 4743, Sandia National Laboratories, Albuquerque, NM 87185","","","United States","1981-12-01T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: Geophys.

Their model consisted of near-surface station corrections and local perturbations to a standard crustal velocity model. The authors found a zone of relatively high-velocity trending southeast from the Salton Sea. This zone corresponds to the region of thickest sediments. The authors compared results with those of teleseismic studies by Savino et al (1977). The agreement was excellent, suggesting that the teleseismic delays are caused primarily by crustal velocity variations. Residual delays between the teleseismic observations and predicted crustal delays imply crustal thinning of 3 or 4 km along the axis of the valley. Known geothermal resource areas at Salton Sea (or Obsidian Buttes), Brawley, and East Mesa, lie on the axis of a zone of thin crust, and they may be intimately related to the Brawley fault. Neither local earthquake nor teleseismic arrival times can discriminate between these hypotheses, but the issue might be resolved by combining both types of data. Known geothermal resource areas at Heber, Dunes, and Glamis, lie away from the projected trace of the Brawley fault. These areas are nearly aseismic, and overlie crust with apparent seismic velocities only mildly higher than the regional average. These apparent velocity anomalies could be related to crustal thinning, but because of the very mild Bouguer gravity anomalies in these areas, it seems more likely that the velocity anomalies occur entirely within the crust. 7 references, 6 figures, 3 tables.","","","Univ. of California, Los Angeles","","","United States","1981-12-01T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: Bull.

R.","15 GEOTHERMAL ENERGY; 58 GEOSCIENCES","For this study, a two-dimensional conceptual model of the East Mesa Geothermal system is developed on the basis of existing geological, geophysical, geochemical, heat flux, and borehole logging data. Hot water rising in a set of faults is assumed to charge the reservoir, which is overlaid by a clay-rich cap. The temperature-depth distribution observed at the site implies that the liquid is converting at a high Rayleigh number. In this approximation, liquid rises up the fault and spreads isothermally into the nearby sections of the reservoir. The cooling effect of the surface on the flow in the reservoir is confined to a thin layer adjacent to the cap-reservoir interface near the fault. This layer grows with the distance from the fault. Eventually, the entire depth of the reservoir is cooled by the surface. The mathematical model is based on the flow of liquid water in a saturated porous medium. Results are obtained for the velocities, pressures, and temperatures in the entire system consisting of fault zone, aquifer, and clay cap.

Such systems are analyzed using the conservation equations to find the temperature history of the fluid produced, the thermal power output, and the fraction of the heat recovered, in terms of the applied pressure drop, the permeability, the anisotropy of the medium, and the scale over which the permeability is effectively homogeneous. In effectively homogeneous media, a thermal front is driven outward from the injection fracture. Rock outside this boundary is hot; within it is cool; for flows with Peclet numbers over 100 the front itself is sharp. The shape of the cooled region depends strongly upon the anisotropy of the medium. The variation of permeability is suitably scaled and related to the Peclet number to elucidate those cases which are favorable for geothermal exploitation.

The model consists of a near-surface condensate layer lying above a two-phase counter-flow region with rising steam and descending water. Real systems have condensate layers several hundred meters thick and vapor-dominated two-phase reservoir temperatures near 513 K. Models which reproduce these general characteristics have net mass flow rate M to thermal conductivity k ratios smaller than about 2.5 x 10/sup -7/ m/sup -3/ and permeability K to thermal conductivity ratios larger than 4.5 x 10/sup -17/ m s/sup 3/ K kg/sup -1/. The mobil fluids in the main reservoirs of these models are essentially all steam. However, the reservoirs of real systems can contain substantial amounts of residual water. Temperature T and pressure p data in the main reservoir of the Kamajang system are best fit by models with K/k between 10/sup 115/ and 10/sup -14/ m s/sup 3/ K kg/sup -1/.

The most notable developments are The Geysers in northern California, with approximately 900 MWe, and the Imperial Valley of southern California, with 14 MWe being generated, and at Klamath Falls, Oregon and Boise, Idaho, where major district heating projects are under construction. Geothermal development is promoted and undertaken by private companies, public utilities, the federal government, and by state and local governments. Geothermal drilling activity showed an increase in exploratory and development work over the five previous years, from an average of 61 wells per year to 96 wells for 1980. These 96 wells accounted for 605,175 ft of hole. The completed wells included 18 geothermal wildcat discoveries, 15 wildcat failures, and 5 geopressured geothermal failures, a total of 38 exploratory attempts. Of the total of 58 geothermal development wells attempted, 55 were considered capable of production amounting to a success ratio of 94.8%. During 1980, two new power plants were put on line at The Geysers, increasing by 37% the total net generating capacity to over 900 MWe. Two power plants commenced production in the Imperial Valley in 1980. Southern California Edison started up a 10-MWe flash steam unit at the Brawley geothermal field in June. Steam is supplied by the Union Oil Company. After an intermittent beginning, Imperial Magma's pilot binary cycle, 11-MWe unit went on line on a continuous basis, producing 7 MWe of power. Hot water is supplied to the plant by Imperial Magma's wells.","","","","","","United States","1981-10-01T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: Am. Assoc. Pet.

There is potential for environmental impacts especially from the higher temperature uses. While most environmental impact analysis and controls development has been concentrated at the Geysers, Calif., vapor-dominated resource, the development of liquid-dominated geothermal resources is beginning and environmental issues have begun to arise. Based on information to date, the environmental impacts from geothermal energy utilization can be controlled to acceptable levels using technology presently available for being developed at this time. More operating experience is required, however, before all the environmental impacts and controls are fully defined. Careful monitoring of effluents and an ongoing effort to anticipate and develop control technologies is needed in critical areas where impacts could occur. This approach should be specific to site and application.","","","Dept. of Energy, Oakland, CA","","","United States","1981-10-01T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","Bibliography","Journal Name: J.

A test of this concept using an analytical model indicates that significant forced convection must occur in the basins even if permeabilities are as low as 50-200 millidarcies at a depth of 2 km. Where groundwater flow is constricted at the discharge areas of the basins forced convection can locally increase the gradient to a level where free convection also occurs, generating surface heat flow anomalies 5-15 times background. A compilation of groundwater data for the rift basins shows a strong correlation between constrictions in groundwater flow and hot springs and geothermal anomalies, giving strong circumstantial support to the convection model.","","","","","","United States","1981-10-01T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: Geotherm.

The potential energy contribution of fourteen different sizes of direct heat projects is used to determine the number of projects of a given size required to produce 1 Quad of energy. The cost of developing 1 Quad of direct-heat geothermal energy from large, intermediate, and small projects is compared to the cost of 1 Quad of energy from conventional sources. The engineering and resource parameters controlling project size are defined. The development of large-scale projects is stressed as the way in which direct-heat geothermal energy can make the most significant contribution to the nation's energy requirements.

Comparisons of model predictions with actual field data for both steam injection for oil recovery and geothermal production showed the validity of the model. The proposed model is based on mass and momentum balances in the wellbore and on heat balance in the wellbore and the surrounding media. The model was employed for a series of tests to evaluate the effects of the injection pressure, injection rate, time, and well completion on the downhole steam pressure and quality. It was found that the slip concept and the flow regime are essential elements in wellbore steam/water flow calculations. 18 refs.","","","Univ of Alberta, Edmonton, Canada","","","United States","1981-10-01T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: SPEJ, Soc.

Hence, we conclude that it is worthwhile to use a field geothermal survey for mapping known hydrocarbon accumulations (and for geological mapping).

Compound systems of the one- and two-stage type are considered. A summary of formulas to assess the performance of the plants is included. From the viewpoint of thermodynamics, compound hybrid plants are superior to individual all-geothermal and all-fossil plants, and have certain advantages over basic geothermal-preheat and fossil-superheat hybrid plants. The flexibility of compound hybrid systems is illustrated by showing how such plants might be used at several geothermal sites in the western United States. 26 refs.","","","Southeast Mass Univ, North Dartmouth, USA","","","United States","1981-10-01T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: J.

These events are probably caused by shear failure induced by high pore fluid pressures. Since the event locations seem to cluster in a narrow band near the hydraulic fracture, we were able to use microseismic techniques to locate the hydraulic fracture and monitor its growth. We calculate the minimum pore pressure increase necessary to induce rock failure using a simple model of slippage on preexisting fractures. By comparing a pore pressure distribution, calculated using a one-dimensional diffusion model with the distribution of event foci, we demonstrate that high pore pressures are a probable cause for these microearthquakes. Stress drops for these microearthquakes, calculated from spectral parameters, increased by a factor of 3 during the course of the experiment. The stress drop increase correlates with a migration of seismic activity away from the injection well bore, which suggests relatively low in situ shear stresses near the well bore caused by strain release in this region during previous pressurizations.","","","Los Alamos National Lab., NM","","","United States","1981-09-10T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: J.

Heat was extracted in a closed-loop mode of operation, injecting water into one well and extracting the heated water from a separate production well. The first reservior was produced by fracturing the injection well at a depth of 2.75 km, where the indigenous rock temperature was 185 /sup 0/C. The relatively rapid decline in temperature of the water produced from the first reservoir, 100 /sup 0/C in 74 days, indicated an effective fracture radius of about 60 m with an average thermal power extracted of 4 MW. A second, larger reservoir was created by refracturing the injection well 180 m deeper. Downhole measurements of water temperature at the reservior outlet as well as temperatures inferred from chemical geothermometry showed that the thermal decline of this reservoir was negligible; the effective heat transfer area of the new reservoir must be at least 45,000 m/sup 2/, nearly 6 times larger than the first reservior. In addition, residence time studies employing visible dye tracers indicated that the mean volume of the second reservoir is 9 times larger. Other measurements showed that flow impedances were low and that downhole water losses from these reservoirs should be manageable. The geochemistry of the produced water was essentially benign with no scaling problems apparent. Moreover, the level of induced seismic activity was insignificantly small.","","","Los Alamos National Laboratory, University of California, Los Alamos, New Mexico 87545","","","United States","1981-08-10T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: J.
