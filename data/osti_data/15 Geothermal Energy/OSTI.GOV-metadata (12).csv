The US Attorney General brought a quiet title action pursuant to 21(b) of the Geothermal Steam Act of 1970 to determine whether geothermal resources are included in the mineral reservation under the Homestead Act. The US District Court granted Union Oil's motion to dismiss for failure to state a claim upon which relief may be granted. On appeal, the Ninth Circuit reversed and remanded. In summary, the court concluded on the basis of the legislative history of the Stock-Raising Homestead Act that sources of energy are intended to remain in the government's possession, and the purposes of the Act will be best served by including geothermal resources in the reservation of mineral interests. Noting the strictly agricultural purpose of the Act, the subsurface estate reservation was broadly interpreted, even though title passed to all rights that were not expressly reserved. The court left open on remand the question of estoppel of the government from interfering with private lessees by developing subsurface resources compensation.This is a unique and intriguing decision, as it opens wide the definition of ''mineral interest,'' construing it in the timely terms of a valuable natural resource that may be in great demand for future energy needs. The decision is being appealed to the United States Supreme Court, and it will be interesting to observe whether this liberal interpretation of mineral interests will be upheld.","","","","","","United States","1978-01-01T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: Nat.

Ultimate recoverable energy resources in Texas are estimated at approx. 365 billion bbl of oil equivalent. Of that, about 1/4 has already been produced. The remaining resource base is a significantly different mix. Of the remaining base, only 28% is measured, indicated, or inferred, 45% is identified but subeconomic, and 28% is classed as yet-to-be discovered. Petroleum (oil, gas, and liquids) has made up 99% of the historic production of Texas energy; however, it constitutes only 50% of the remaining measured reserves, and only 30% of the estimated remaining resource base. Lignite and coal have contributed only 0.4% to historic production, yet they represent 40% of both the measured reserve and the resource base. Uranium production to date has been only 0.8% of cumulative energy production, but constitutes 10% of the measured reserve base. Geothermal resources make up 20% of the resource base.","","","","","","United States","1980-12-01T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: Interstate Oil Compact Comm. Com.

Why doesn't the water fall down. We show that a heavy fluid phase overlying a light phase of the same fluid in a porous medium can be stable provided the permeability in the vicinity of the interface is not too large. The special behavior of a phase change interface in response to disturbances of the boundary account for the stabilization. Heavy fluids overlying light fluids in a porous medium are unstable, irrespective of permeability, if the fluids are immiscible. Application of the stabiliy analysis to vapor-dominated geothermal systems shows that the condensate layer can be stabilized if the permeability near its base is no large than about 40 nm/sup 2/ (0.04 millidarcy).","","","Space Sciences Laboratory, The Aerospace Corporation, Los Angeles, California 90009","","","United States","1980-11-10T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: J.

The attenuation of a seismic wave is proportional to Q/sup -1/, the reciprocal of the quality factor. The reduced spectral ratio technique has been used to infer Q structure. This technique is adapated to study a geothermal system. A generalized discrete linear inversion technique is applied to the observed differential attenuation data deltat* of teleseismic P waves to obtain a discrete Q model. Errors have a large effect on the Q model in a local area. Five sources of errors are involved in the estimation of deltat*. Four levels of random errors are added to synthetic data for eight different assumed models, using 12 events and 11 stations. These data are inverted to assess the effect of the observation errors on the inferred Q structures. For signal to error ratio (S/E) above 5 the models are reproducible; between 5 and 1 a dramatic degradation of fidelity occurs; and at 1 or below, numerous low Q cells are identified as high Q and vice versa. Acquisition of more numerous, better distributed data with lower error improves the quality of the inversion. A two-dimensional Q model of the Geysers-Clear Lake geothermal area is obtained using previously reported attenuation data of six teleseismic events with S/E of 4. A high-attenuation (low Q) zone is found located in the middle crust centered southeast of Mount Hannah, roughly corroborating the gravity and P wave travel time residual models.","","","Center for Energy Studies, University of Texas at Dallas, Richardson, Texas 75080","","","United States","1980-10-10T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: J.

Space- and water-heating uses are growing even faster than process applications, with district-heating systems offering the greatest potential. Hot-dry-rock and geopressured resources also hold promise despite problems. (DCK)","","","","","","United States","1980-10-01T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: Energy Manage.

The approach features calculation of a Fourier series fit to the surface temperature - surface evaluation data where the surface temperatures are based on a model that includes surface temperature variations due to microclimate variations. Mathematics of the terrain correction problem are similar to upward (away from source) continuation problem in gravity and magnetics so several solutions, in addition to the Fourier series approach, are available in the literature that allow an accurate calculation of the correction provided the surface boundary condition is properly specified. However, the usual boundary condition applied, a linear relation between ground surface temperature and elevation, is shown to be inadequate for drill holes in the depth range 30 to 200 m no matter how low the topographic relief. Thus a model of ground surface temperature is developed that includes the effects of elevation, slope orientation, and slope angle. Because of the effects of microclimate, the classical models that have isothermal surfaces that generally parallel the topographic surface are significantly in error in many cases, and the patterns of isotherms near the topographic surface are more complicated than was previously recognized.","","","Southern Methodist Univ., Dallas, TX","","","United States","1980-09-10T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: J.

The total exploratory footage drilled was slightly lower, but the total number of successful exploratory wells was up 19% from 1978. One new oil field and 5 new gas field discoveries were reported in California. None of these discoveries appear to be of major size. During 1979, hydrocarbons were discovered in commercial quantities for the first time in Oregon - the Mist Gas field, in the northwestern corner of the state, in Columbia County. A pipeline was constructed for initial production in late 1979. This discovery has spurred drilling and leasing activity. Mobil drilled a second deep exploratory well in Oregon, to 10,412 ft, which was subsequently abandoned. Only 1 shallow oil and gas exploratory well was drilled in Washington State this year. As yet it has not been completed. Development drilling in California, although down from 1978, continued at an active pace and is related largely to steam-flood projects. Production of oil outstripped additions to reserves by 285.8 million bbl in 1979. Geothermal activity increased in California's Imperial Valley and Geysers area. Southern California Edison Co. has begun construction of a 10-Mw generating plant near Brawley in the Imperial Valley. Two other geothermal projects in the Imperial Valley sponsored by Southern California Edison include the development of a 50-Mw unit near Heber and a prospective 10-Mw plant south of the Salton Sea. Westmoreland Geothermal Associates also have plans to develop a plant in the valley. In the Geysers area, Sacramento Municipal Utility District plans to construct a 55-Mw plant.

Some of these estimates have been based on conceptually inappropriate or quantitatively unreasonable models of the cooling oceanic lithosphere. The cooling uniform half-space model is the most appropriate first approximation and is presently adequate to describe the preferred selection of oceanic heat flow data. Hydrothermal transport in young oceanic curst may account of 25% of the total global heat flow. After appropriate allowances are made for this, there is general consistency between recent estimates of total heat flow. Total global heat flow is probably 4.1 +- 0.4 x 10/sup 13/ W, which corresponds to an average flux of 80 +- 8 mW/m/sup 2/. The average oceanic heat flux is roughly 70% greater than the average continental flux: they are about 95 +- 10 mW/m/sup 2/ and 55 +- 5 mW/m/sup 2/, respectively. There may be significant fluctuations in total heat flow on time scales of 10/sup 7/--10/sup 8/ years.","","","Department of Earth and Planetary Sciences and McDonell Center for Space Sciences, Washington University, St. Louis, Missouri 63130","","","United States","1980-08-01T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: Rev.

Averages of the observed values are 55 mW m/sup -2/ in the Aleutian Basin, 120 mW m/sup -2/ in the Kamchatka Basin, and 80 mW m/sup -2/ for two measurements in the Bowers Basin near the Bowers Ridge. Correcting these averages for the effects of sedimentation gives values of 69 mW m/sup -2/, 138 mW m/sup -2/, and 95 mW m/sup -2/, respectively. A useful nomogram for computing the thermal effect of an extended period of sedimentation is presented. Several methods of averaging heat flow values in marginal basins are compared using the data from the Aleutian Basin. If the Aleutian Basin was formed by the sea floor spreading process, then the heat flow suggests an age of about 44 m.y., which is considerably younger than magnetic data suggest. An alternative explanation is that the high heat flow is a residuum of thermal processes associated with the now extinct Kula Spreading Center and the Kula Plate, which underthrust the Bering Sea in the early Tertiary and thermally rejuvenated the trapped mesozoic sea floor underlying the Aleutian Basin. The high average jeat flow in the Kamchatka Basin suggests a considerably younger age for this basin, and the very high values in the southwestern part indicate either thin lithosphere or recent magnitic activity.","","","Lamont-Doherty Geological Observatory of Columbia University, Palisades, New York 10964","","","United States","1980-07-10T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: J.

Despite a relatively depauperate fauna and flora in the lake, 24 food items were found in intestines of G. boraxobius. Ten of the 24 foods, including six insects, were of terrestrial origin. The relative importance of food items fluctuated seasonally. Diatoms, chironomid larvae, microcrustaceans, and dipteran adults were the primary foods during spring. In summer, diatoms decreased and terrestrial insects increased in importance. During autumn important foods were terrestrial insects, chironomid larvae, and diatoms. Diatoms and microcrustaceans increased in importance during winter. Chironomid larvae were of importance in winter, when the importance of terrestrial food items decreased substantially. Similar food habits were observed between juveniles and adults, except that adults consumed more gastropods and diatoms and juveniles consumed more copepods and terrestrial insects. Gila boraxobius feeds opportunistically with individuals commonly containing mostly one food item. Fish typically feed by picking foods from soft bottom sediments or from rocks. However, fish will feed throughout the water column or on the surface if food is abundant there. Gila boraxobius feeds throughout the day, with a peak in feeding activity just after sunset.

When corrections are applied for topography and refraction, the range of heat flow is narrowed to between 38 and 42 mW m/sup -2/. In comparison with heat flows from other parts of the West African Craton, these values are consistent with preliminary results from Ghana (42 +- 8 mW m/sup -2/) and Nigeria (38 +- 2 mW /sup -2/) but are somewhat higher than values from Niger (20 mW m/sup -2/) and neighboring Sierra Leone (26 mW m/sup -2/). The Liberian values are significantly lower than the heat flow offshore in the equatorial Atlantic Ocean (58 +- 8 mW m/sup -2/), suggesting large lateral temperature gradients within the lithosphere near the coast. Values of heat production from outcrops of crystalline basement rocks near the holes are between 2 and 2.3 ..mu..W m/sup -3/. A heat-flow/heat-production relation cannot be established because of the small range of values; however, assuming a 'characteristic depth' of 8 km (similar to the North American Craton) the reduced heat flow of from 20 to 25 mW m/sup -2/ is consistent with that from other Precambrian shields.","","","U.

The Cerro Prieto field in the northwest is the principal power source for an isolated network of the Comision Federale de Electricidad. The Cerro Prieto field lies in the seismic belt that extends down the western edge of the North American continent. Development of the Mexican field began in earnest in 1962. At the present, an area of some 12 km/sup 2/ has been fully investigated and reserves are estimated sufficient to generate 7 TWh/year for 40 years. The present four-unit power station has generated some 4000 GWh of electricity over its seven-year life so far. The development plan aims to have 620 MW in service by 1984. Most of this capacity will come from the second and third power plants. Construction should start on the second plant soon. Timing of the third plant depends on arrangements made for energy sale to a group of U.S. utilities. Besides utilizing the geothermal energy, the site is a source of chemicals. In particular, the present flow needed to support power generation could yield 86,000 tons/year of potassium chloride (almost the total Mexican requirement for this currently-imported materail). Fertimex expects a separation plant to produce various materials to be in full operation by 1982. Excellent results have been obtained from test drillings at another potential geothermal site south of Mexico City at Los Azufres. It is located in a broad active zone that stretches across the country from the Pacific to the Atlantic. By the end of the century, Mexico aims to have geothermal energy availability at 40 TWh/year.

Subsequently, they deployed a portable Centipede array of 26 three-component stations near the center of anomaly.

During the first 2 years of network operations, 4216 local earthquakes (0.5< or =m< or =3.9) defined zones of seismicity that strike radially outward from a Pleistocene rhyolite field located near the center of the Coso Range. Most earthquakes were located in zones showing a general northwest trend across the range. Six earthquake swarms occurred within the area that includes the rhyolite field. Fault plane solutions show regional north-south compression: earthquakes located in northwest striking zones generally had right lateral strike slip focal mechanisms, those in northeast striking zones left lateral strike slip focal mechanisms, and those in north-south striking zones both normal and strike slip focal mechanisms. Earthquake depths showed little variation across the Coso Range; the depth distribution is similar to that of several carefully studied segments of the central San Andreas fault. The b value calculated for the entire range is 0.99 +- 0.08. The rhyolite field has a significantly higher b value of 1.26 +- 0.16; if only the shallow events (depth <5 km) are used in the calculation, the b value for this area becomes even higher, 1.34 +- 0.24. The higher b values were interpreted as reflecting the existence of short average fault lengths (<5 km) within the rhyolite field. The seismic data and other data suggest that the fault system lying between the rhyolite field and the adjacent Coso Basin is an important tectonic boundary.

These computations together with appropriate formulation of the alteration chemical reactions have been used to estimate total enthalpy produced per unit volume of altered rock. Enthalpy of alteration varies widely depending on the model assumed for sulfate production and the intensity of alteration. Maximum enthalpy production for the most altered rock ranges from 2450 to 7070 J/cm/sup 3/, depending on whether none or all of the sulfate required to produce alunite is derived from H/sub 2/S oxidation. The mean enthalpies in the lower 30 m of two drill holes 60 and 66 m deep are 345 and 105 J/cm/sup 3/. Approximate age and depth-of-alteration constraints suggest heat flow due to alteration may be as low as 4 mW/m/sup 2/ or as great as 852 mW/m/sup 2/ depending on alteration intensity and sulfur oxidation. Even though chemical reactions could account for a substantial fraction of measured heat flow, comparison of measured temperatures with temperature calculations indicates an insignificant contribution of alteration reactions to present-day heat flow.

Most of the extrusions are probably less than about 0.3 m.y. old. The area is one of Quaternary basaltic volcanism and crustal extension. The central part of the rhyolite field is characterized by high heat flow, low apparent resistivity, and substantial fumarolic activity indicative of an active geothermal system. The immediate source of heat for the surficial geothermal phenomena is probably a silicic magma reservoir that may still contain molten or partially molten material at a depth of at least 8 km beneath the central part of the rhyolite field. Outlying rhyolite extrusions probably reflect the presence of feeder dikes emanating from the reservoir beneath the central region. Azimuths of dikes appear to be parallel to the regional tectonic axis of maximum horizontal compression, analogous to some dike-fed flank eruptions on basaltic shields and andesitic strato-volcanoes.

Rather, linear gravity contours, which suggest a regional tectonic origin, enclose the location of most of the volcanic activity of the Coso Range. Faults along the edges of northwest trending, magnetic blocks probably provided paths of minimum resistance to the ascending viscous magma that was extruded as rhyolite domes. Dense, magnetic rocks associated with a complex mafic pluton 9 km in diameter form a relatively impermeable north border of the Pleistocene volcanic field. A heat flow high nearly coincides with the west half of a 6-km-diameter magnetic low. A 2-km-diameter outcrop of a pre-Cenozoic silicic pluton, which has low magnetization compared to the surrounding metamorphic rocks, presumably typifies the rocks that underlie the magnetic low and heat flow high. Hydrothermal fluids may have destroyed some magnetite in the more magnetic wall rock, further reducing the magnetic intensity.","","","U.S. Geological Survey, Menlo Park, California 94025","","","United States","1980-05-10T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: J.

New information suggests the Coso Range is situated in an area of transition between the stress of the right slip San Andreas fault-plate interaction and the extensional tectonics of the Basin and Range. Arcuate faults in the Coso Range are interpreted to have been produced by the regional stress field rather than to have been of volcanogenic origin. Focal mechanisms of small-magnitude earthquakes support the stress directions indicated by local fault patterns. Fumeroles in the area are primarily associated with oblique slip faults rather than with arcuate or ring faults. The geothermal reservoir is therefore much different from that of a caldera or subsidence bowl, and the overall geothermal potential is probably less than earlier estimates.","","","Department of Geological Sciences, University of Nevada-Reno, Reno, Nevada 89557","","","United States","1980-05-10T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: J.

These computations together with appropriate formulation of the alteration chemical reactions have been used to estimate total enthalpy produced per unit volume of altered rock. Enthalpy of alteration varies widely depending on the model assumed for sulfate production per unit volume of altered rock. Enthalpy of alteration varies widely depending on the model assumed for sulfate production and the intensity of alteration. Maximum enthalpy production for the most altered rock ranges from 2450 to 7070 J/cm/sup 3/, depending on whether none or all of the sulfate required to produce alunite is derived from H/sub 2/S oxidation. The mean enthalpies in the lower 30 m of two drill holes 60 and 66 m deep are 345 and 105 J/cm/sup 3/. Approximate age and depth-of-alteration constraints suggest heat flow due to alteration may be as low as 4 mW/m/sup 2/ or as great as 852 mW/m/sup 2/ depending on alteration intensity and sulfur oxidation. Even though chemical reactions could account for a substantial fraction of measured heat flow, comparison of measured temperatures with temperature calculations indicates an insignificant contribution of alteration reactions to present-day heat flow. The present thermal gradient is explained in terms of convective circulation with a mass flux of water of 1.3 x 10/sup -6/ kg/m/sup 2/ s estimated from alteration mineral abundance.","","","Univ. of Utah, Salt Lake City","","","United States","1980-05-10T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: J.

A secondary resistivity low with a north-south trend runs through the Coso Hot Springs--Devil's Kitchen geothermal area. The secondary low in the geothermal area, best defined by the 7.5-Hz AMT map and dc soundings, is caused by a shallow conductive zone (5--30 ohm m) interpreted to be hydrothermally altered Sierra Nevada basement rocks containing saline water of a hot water geothermal system.

Pleistocene volcanic rocks associated with the geothermal activity include 38 rhyolite domes occupying a north trending structural and topographic ridge and numerous basaltic cinder cones and lava flows partly surrounding its southern half. In an investigation of the thermal regime of this Basin and Range geothermal area, temperature measurements were made in 25 shallow and 1 intermediate depth borehole. Geothermal gradients ranged from 25.3 /sup 0/C/km to 906. /sup 0/C/km. The high gradients arise from convecting hot water and former convective transport of heat by dikes that fed the domes and flows. Thermal conductivity measurements were made on 312 samples from cores and drill cuttings.. The actual process by which heat is transferred is rather complex; however, the heat flow determinations can be divided into two groups. The first group, less than 4.0 HFU, are indicative of regions with primarily conductive regimes, although deep-seated mass transfer is implied. The second group, greater than 4.0 HFU, are characteristics of regions with considerable convective heat transfer in the shallow subsurface. Heat transferred by convection of water would be rapidly exhausted if it were not intermittently supplied with heat energy from depth; therefore the heat flow data substantiate the concept that the surface hydrothermal activity and associated volcanic rocks are products of a long-lived magmatic system that has periodically erupted lava during the past 0.3--1.0 m.y. This magmatic system is the crustal heat source of the present-day Coso geothermal system (1 HFU=41.87 mW/m/sup 2/).","","","GeoThermal Services, Inc., San Diego, California 92131","","","United States","1980-05-10T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: J.

Inversion of the relative residual data for three-dimensional velocity structure determines the lateral variations in velocity to a depth of 22.5 km beneath the array. An intense low-velocity body, which concides with the surface expressions of late Pleistocene rhyolitic volcanism, high heat flow, and hydrothermal activity, is resolved between 5- and 20-km depth. It has maximum velocity contrast of over 8% between 10 and 17.5 km. The shallowest part of this body is centered below the region of highest heat flow; at depth it is elongate in approximately the N-S direction.

About half of the electricity-grade hydrothermal energy in the United States is in the high-temperature range and can be converted using direct-flash steam cycle technology. The other half is in the moderate-temperature range, for which the binary cycle is used. The binary cycle involves a second fluid that vaporizes at a much lower temperature than water. The Heber Project in California will be the first direct-flash commercial generation plant. Some of the technical and environmental problems of the direct-flash cycle are being studied by the Electric Power Research Institute. The binary cycle is still in the pilot-to-demonstration stage. As the authors point out, the bottom line is still a combination of reliability and busbar electricity cost. The cost must meet the competitive market set by other fuels and technologies.

The plateau coincides with a negative gravity anomaly interpreted as a large silicic magma reservoir. About 0.15 km/sup 3/ of rhyodacitic pyroclastic flows were erupted 1100 years ago from vents beneath the present Crags and flowed for 21 km down the valleys of Lost and Manzanita Creeks. Pumice pyroclasts in the flows are characterized by high phenocryst content and low vesicularity. These eruptions were followed by the extrusion of 1.25 km/sup 3/ of dacitic lava as a stubby flow and three-lobed dome. The tephra and lava appear to be products of intrusion of mostly liquid high-alumina basalt into a large, partially crystallized rhyolitic magma body with subsequent mixing. The earliest tephra contain only a minor basaltic component while the youngest portion of the Crags contain approximately 20%. This change with time reflects either a vertical zonation in the magma inherited from the mixing event or a continued admixing of basaltic magma within the chamber during the span of eruptive period.","","","Los Alamos Scientific Lab., NM","","","United States","1980-05-01T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: J.

A quasi-analytic theory is developed for high Rayleigh number convection of liquid in a rigid porous medium. In this approximation, liquid rises up the fault and spreads into the near regions of the reservoir isothermally. The cooling effect of the surface on the fault flow is confined to a thin layer near the surface. This layer grows with distance from the fault. In the far field of the aquifer the full depth of the reservoir is cooled by the surface. A study is made of the effect of various parameters such as mass flow rate, Rayleigh number, and fault width on the pressures, velocities, temperatures, and their gradients at different locations in the fault and in the aquifer.

Consequently, the large water-filled cracks considered for use in the extraction of geothermal heat might be expected to pop to the earth's surface. in this paper it is shown that a freely slipping horizontal joint (as well as a not so freely slipping joint) can stop the upward motion of a large liquid-filled crack. If the joint is tightly fitting, there is not limit to the length of a stopped crack. If slip on a joint results in the joint being propped open, the maximum crack length of a stopped crack is given by the crevasse expression: total crack length =..pi..T/2(rho-rho')g, where T is the tectonic stress, g is the gravitational acceleration, and rho-rho' is the difference between the rock and liquid density. The results can also be applied to the problem of magma transport in the earth's crust. In particular, laccolith emplacement is favored when the nonhydrostatic tectonic stress component is compressive in character.","","","Department of Materials Science and Engineering and Department of Geological Sciences Northwestern University, Evanston, Illinois 60201","","","United States","1980-02-10T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: J.

The model accounts for the dependence of magma viscosity on crystallinity, temperature, and bulk composition; it includes latent heat effects and the effects of different initial water concentrations in the melt, and quantitatively considers the role that large volumes of circulatory hydrothermal fluids play in dissipating heat. The nonlinear ordinary differential equation describing these processes was solved for a variety of magma compositions, initial temperatures, initial crystallinities, volume ratios of hydrothermal fluid to magma, and pluton sizes. These calculations are graphically summarized in plots of the average magma temperature versus time after emplacement. Solidification times, defined as the time necessary for magma to cool from the initial emplacement temperature to the solidus temperature vary as R/sup 1/ /sup 3/, where R is the pluton radius. The solidification time of a pluton with a radius of 1 kilometer is 5 x 10/sup 4/ years; for an otherwise identical pluton with a radius of 10 kilometers, the solidification time is approx. 10/sup 6/ years. The water content has a marked effect on the solidification time. A granodiorite pluton with a radius of 5 kilometers and either 0.5 or 4 percent (by weight) water cools in 3.3 x 10/sup 5/ or 5 x 10/sup 4/ years, respectively.

Each mountain range exhibits a variety of structural situations; most stratigraphic units are folded and faulted, and many are intruded by igneous rocks. Exposed stratigraphic units range in age from Precambrian to Triassic for the more consolidated units and from Tertiary to Quaternary for mostly nonconsolidated or partially consolidated units. Box Elder County has had little production of mineral fuels. A small amount of petroleum was produced at Rozel Point on the north shores of Great Salt Lake and a small amount of natural gas has been produced from a few wells in the eastern part of the county. One well was drilled for its geothermal possibilities but the results were inconclusive. A lignite field in the northwest part of the state has only a marginal potential. Very low grade vein-type deposits of uranium and thorium have been discovered in widely separated occurrences in the county. 161 references.","","","","","","United States","1980-01-01T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: Utah Geol.

The formulation integrates the technological characteristics of hydrothermal-reservoir management and electric-power generation into an optimal economic investment-production model. Of particular interest is the incorporation of time-dependent resource-decline phenomena into the model. Assuming an objective of maximizing net present value, the solution provides optimal rates over time of electric-power production, of capital investment in well-field equipment, and of hydrothermal resource extraction. 7 references, 4 figures.","","","","","","United States","1980-01-01T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: Energy Syst.

For optimal resource utilization one must separate the natural gas while simultaneously maximizing the conversion processes required for the liquid phase. The present paper discusses some basic thermodynamic concepts which determine the conversion effectiveness of hydraulic and thermal energy components. Using realistic resource data for Texas and Louisiana, it is shown that there is a range of well flow rates which maximizes the brine energy recovery. The effects of salinity levels on various flow parameters are also illustrated; in general, salinity is found to have a minor effect on theoretical performance. Hence, the major influence of dissolved solids would be on equipment performance.","","","Univ. of Texas, Austin","","","United States","1980-01-01T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: Am.

The cost of installing geothermal systems in new buildings is comparable to that of oil and gas systems. No formal agreements have been signed, although 53 businesses and a shopping-mall developer expect to negotiate when the rates are announced. Geothermal wells have been used in Boise since the 1930s, but interest lagged until the recent increases in utility rates.

Their internal temperatures have been measured at up to 13 /sup 0/C above the bottom water temperature, and total heat flow (conducted plus convected) can be several hundred to several thousand times the normal oceanic values. Fluids, when they discharge from the mound, do so at a very slow rate and at temperatures probably quite near the bottom water temperature.

They are generally found in rows, in a uniformly sedimented area above faults or fractures in the crustal rocks which permit fluids to escape from a deep hydrothermal aquifer. The sediment blanket in some way alters the chemistry of the ascending thermal fluids and leads to the development of mounds.

By using a computer controlled anodic stripping voltammeter with automatic background correction, pseudopolarograms can be obtained by plotting the peak area vs the deposition potential for a series of stripping voltammetric runs. With ASV as a method of amplification, the ligand number and stability constants are determined for metal complexes at concentration ranges expected of natural water systems. Results for lead and cadmium with chloride and carbonate are in excellent agreement with those of less sensitive methods used at higher concentrations. No complexation of lead and cadmium was found with glycine at pH 4.68. The structure of arsenic(III) at 1.0 ng/mL in acidic solutions was determined to be As(OH)/sub 3/ using a gold film electrode.

The results of a linear stability analysis indicate that the critical Rayleigh number R* is time dependent. For spontaneous neutral stability, R* (t=0) approx. =10(h/a) /sup 2/, where h and a are the fault height and aperture, respectively. Since h>>a, R* (0) is several orders of magnitude greater than the value 4..pi../sup 2/ that would pertain to the same situation without the influence of the surrounding rock masses, e.g., a porous bed with large horizontal dimensions. The resultant cell motion consists of rolls about axes parallel to the aperture. These rolls are of height h and closely spaced in the strike direction. Cases of spontaneous instabilities in fractures or faults are expected to be infrequent, but initially subcritical convection could be fostered by other means such as tectonic displacements at the fault. Because R* diminishes as time /sup -1/2/, eventually, this subcritical convection becomes unstable, and exponential growth ensues. As the heat of the surrounding rock is depleted and an isothermal state is approached, the convection eventually dampens until a period of thermal recovery allows its resumption.","","","Geosciences Division, Alamos Scientific Laboratory, Los Alamos, New Mexico 87545","","","United States","1979-10-10T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: J.

In general, the geothermal fluid flows through a heat exchanger in which it heats fresh water from a nearby river. The heated fresh water, in turn, is used for a variety of purposes in the environs of these stations. A major use is in bathing which is a reflection of the bathing-loving trait of the Japanese.

Such situations require design consideration above normal collapse and frequently need design criteria on tension, internal resistance, and others. For doglegs and directionally drilled holes the tubing has to contain internal and external pressures as well as normal tension. In geothermal and vapor injection wells the tubing is subjected to large increases in temperature causing an expanding tendency of the tubing. Since the tubing is fixed at both ends this results in tubing rotation and axial compression. For injection wells and wells subjected to hydraulic fracturing, the tubing is subjected to additional tension and compression forces not normal to production situations.

The program goal is to increase the annual rate of energy utilization from the present 0.04 quads (500 MWe) to 0.3 to 0.5 quads in the near-term (about 1985), 4.0 to 9.0 quads in the mid-term (1985 to 2000), and 16.0 to 28.0 quads in the long-term (by about 2020). The realization of these goals depends upon the discovery and exploitation of many new geothermal resource areas. The Department of Energy program for geothermal exploration and assessment has been structured to address technological barriers presently hindering the economical discovery and delineation of geothermal resources. The program elements - exploration technology, reservoir assessment, reservoir confirmation, and reservoir engineering - are described in light of the need to evaluate some 1500 new prospects in order to meet the federal midterm electric power goal of 20,000 MWe on line by the year 2000. The program elements are illustrated with suggested sequences from exploration, assessment, and confirmation of a 200-MWe resource in the eastern Basin and Range physiographic province. The estimated costs for these sequences are $385,000, $565,000, and $3,190,000, respectively.

Each flat is bounded on the northwest by a high active slip face of sand and on the southeast by a more gently inclined deflated sand slope, suggesting that the flats are moving southeasterly along the chain axis. Measurements over a 12-y interval confirm this movement and indicate an average southeasterly movement of 35 to 40 cm/y. Development of alluvium-floored intradune flats is presaged by formation of ridge and hollow couplets father to the northwest. Embryonic ridge-and-hollow forms extend almost to the northwestern tip of the chain. Development of long, linear transverse, sand-trapping ridges, which are instrumental in creating downwind hollows, appears to be an inherent characteristic of eolian transport under conditions of relatively smooth terrain, scanty vegetation, and a limited flux of sand supplied approximately orthogonally to a dominant resultant direction of drift. Principal resultant sand drift produced by a multidirectional wind regime over the dunes is southeast; northeast is the next most favored direction. Secondary influences of faulting may account for the unusual linearity of the chain, which is probably a belt of shoreline dunes about 37,000 y old. Intradune flats are large enough to be resolved on orbiter photos of Mars, and some of the patterns on the martian surface attributed to eolian processes may involve intradune flats.","","","California Inst. of Tech., Pasadena","","","United States","1979-10-01T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: Geol.

These deposits have proved enigmatic to geologists; until recently, many were mistaken for lava flows or sedimentary rock units. Over the last twenty years, however, numerous field and laboratory studies have begun to explain the eruption phenomena that created them. Portions of these deposits have provided singularly useful building materials, and ancient dwellings were actually carved into pyroclastic deposits on several continents. Today, young deposits provide evidence for underlying geothermal reservoirs, which may prove to be valuable resources. Some rare elements with commercial and strategic value, such as lithium, are made recoverable through large-scale pyroclastic eruptions and subsequent weathering processes. Uranium and thorium, as well as lithium, are concentrated at the surface in this way. On the other end of the nuclear fuel cycle, older pyroclastic deposits have many properties that suggest their use for the storage of radioactive wastes.","","","Los Alamos Scientific Lab., NM","","","United States","1979-09-01T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: Am.

The radon sources are radium in soil, in bed-rock, in building materials, and in radon-rich water. While radon and its daughter products emit alpha, beta, and gamma radiation on decay, and therefore an identified health hazard, health spas extol the salubrious effects of radon-rich waters.

The health spa regions are, of course, potential sites for geothermal development; but, use for medical purposes prevents such development.","","","","","","United States","1979-09-01T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: Important for the Future; (United States); Journal Volume: 4:4","","Medium: X; Size: Pages: 2-5","","","","Journal ID: CODEN: IMFUD","","","2009-12-16T00:00:00Z","5302029","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/5302029","","Important for the Future; (United States)","","4:4"

Roosevelt Hot Springs is located on the Wasatch front in southern Utah, an area characterized by Tertiary intrusions. Arrays of vertical seismometers with spacings of 50 to 100 m were installed at selected locations. The data from three arrays were studied in detail; one was located directly above the geothermal reservoir, one was in the valley to the west, and one was in the Mineral Mountains to the east of the reservoir. The principle analysis technique consisted of computing frequency-wavenumber spectra of the noise in the frequency range from 0.5 to 10 Hz. For frequencies less than 1.0 Hz, the arrays were too small for adequate resolution, and at frequencies higher than 10.0 Hz, the noise showed no spatial organization. The theoretical response of seismometer arrays to waves arriving from numerous directions, such as would be the case directly above a geothermal reservoir, is developed to allow comparison with the experimental results. During times of cultural activity (mainly road traffic and trains in the valley), the noise was highly variable in amplitude and consisted almost exclusively of Rayleigh waves from the cultural sources. At quiet times, the noise field was more complex. For the arrays at the reservoir and in the valley, the results of frequency-wavenumber computations indicate that the noise consists of isotropic Rayleigh waves. No waves were detected that could be related to the geothermal reservoir. The array in the Mineral Mountains, farther away from the cultural noise sources, showed a completely different noise field. The noise consisted of high-velocity P-waves from a source to the east of the known geothermal area.","","","Univ. of Tulsa, OK","","","United States","1979-09-01T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: Geophysics; (United States); Journal Volume: 44:9","","Medium: X; Size: Pages: 15-70","","","","Journal ID: CODEN: GPYSA","10.1190/1.1441027","","2016-05-25T00:00:00Z","5429007","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/5429007","","Geophysics; (United States)","","44:9"

The geothermal discovery well by McCulloch of the South Brawley field in the Imperial Valley is the deepest geothermal well drilled in California. This well may open a broad new area for deep fracture production. The first Imperial Valley geothermal power plant will begin generating electricity this year and 6 more plants are in various stages of design and construction throughout the valley.

The model examined is that of a rectangular reservoir comprised of three horizontal permeable layers with different permeabilities. The reservoir is considered to be bounded by impermeable surfaces on the sides and at the bottom. The upper boundary of the aquifer is permeable, which permits the recharge and discharge of water to and from the aquifer. A transient two-dimensional convective flow is developed when the impermeable boundaries are raised suddenly to high temperatures. The governing nonlinear partial differential equations with appropriate boundary and initial conditions are solved numerically by finite difference methods. Application of the direct method for solving Poisson's equation for stream function made it possible to carry out the solution for a much longer time than possible with iterative techniques. Numerical results are obtained for various parameters and configurations of the geothermal reservoir. The influence of a less permeable middle layer on the flow and heat transfer characteristics in the aquifer is discussed. The computed vertical temperature profiles are similar in shape to the complex temperature profiles observed at the HGP-A well.","","","Department of Mechanical Engineering University of Hawall, Honolulu, Hawaii 96822","","","United States","1979-08-01T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: J.

By plotting temperature gradient versus temperature the significance of convective heat transfer can be determined. Such a plot is useful even when the flow system is not one-dimensional or vertical. As an example of convective heat transfer, a temperature log from the Rio Puerco area of New Mexico shows that downward groundwater movement of 4.7 x 10/sup -7/ cm/s over a 77-m interval can reduce the observed geothermal gradient and heat flow by a factor of 2 from 4.1 to 2.0 HFU (1 HFU = 1 ..mu..cal cm/sup -2/ s/sup -1/). Such strong perturbations of heat flow by groundwater indicate the need for deep heat flow measurements to obtain a geothermal heat flux undisturbed by near-surface groundwater. By considering the convective flux one can use the total energy balance at the bounderies of aquifers and a semiconfining medium to obtain information about groundwater seepage within the semiconfining layer.","","","New Mexico Bureau of Mines and Mineral Resources, New Mexico Institute of Mining and Technology, Socorro, N.

It is therefore proposed to adopt the availability accounting and effectiveness on the basis of the second law of thermodynamics. Some examples of energy- and availability-accounting are shown for existing geothermal power plants. The effectiveness is found to be very useful as a utiliztation factor for geothermal energy, and it is suggested that the availability accounting is usefully employed in conjunction with the conventional energy accounting in obtaining data to find measures for improvement of the performance of a geothermal power plant. In addition, with the aid of the effectiveness, comparison of the performances can be readily made among the different types of power plant, and the existing geothermal power plants are found to be as effective in utilization of energy as recent steam power plants.","","","","","","United States","1979-07-01T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: Energy Dev.

Human use of energy is strongly influenced by variations of weather. Such systems as electric power transmission networks, shipping of hydrocarbons by sea, and pipelines for the transportation of large quantities of oil and gas, are all particularly sensitive to weather and climate.

The inversion consists of two parts. In the first, the concern is to construct a resistivity structure whose responses are acceptably close to the observations, that is, the measured amplitudes and/or phases. This construction proceeds iteratively and is realized through an automated algorithm which is characterized by numerical stability and rapid convergence. In the second part, the degree of nonuniqueness inherent in the problem is investigated. Only spatial averages of the resistivity are considered because all models linearly close to the constructed model have the same average resistivity. The predictions of this statement are examined quantitatively in an example where the averages from five different models which reproduce the observations are compared. In an example using data from a moderately complex layered model, the amplitudes and phases are inverted jointly and separately, and their resolution is compared. Finally, data from the Snake River Plain-Yellowstone area are inverted, and the results compared with those from a parametric inversion. 22 figures, 3 tables.","","","Univ. of British Columbia, Vancouver","","","United States","1979-07-01T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: Geophysics; (United States); Journal Volume: 44:7","","Medium: X; Size: Pages: 1218-1244","","","","Journal ID: CODEN: GPYSA","10.1190/1.1441004","","2016-05-17T00:00:00Z","5828658","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/5828658","","Geophysics; (United States)","","44:7"

If each barrel contains 40 cubic feet of dissolved methane, then the resource could be expected to contain 3.76 trillion cubic feet of dissolved methane in place for the presently defined Tuscaloosa Fairway; 1.22 trillion cubic feet or 32.5% are located in the Solitude Point Prospect. Recent information indicates that the next two fault blocks north of the Solitude Point Prospect are geopressured, with a gradient of approximately 0.6. The permeabilities and porosities are excellent and far exceed those accepted as minimal for a geothermal resource. The addition of the Tuscaloosa Trend amplifies the previous assessment of the geothermal-geopressured resource in South Louisiana. The need for a test well and its evaluation is critical to the continued understanding and development of the potential energy source. With the potential for methane development alone, we simply must make every effort to integrate this energy source into the future supplies of this nation.

The new values, in conjunction with previous data, confirm the Baja peninsula as an area of low to normal heat flow and demonstrate an irregular decrease of heat flow eastward from the Gulf of California across the Sierra Madre Occidental and a separate pattern of decreasing heat flow eastward from the Central Plateau across the Sierra Madre Oriental. An area of high heat flow immediately east of the Gulf of California is identified and is tentatively related to the spreading ridges in the gulf. Abundances of the radioactive-heat-generating elements uranium, thorium, and potassium increase from Baja California to the eastern border of the Sierra Madre Occidental, abruptly decrease within the Central Plateau, and then increase again eastward through the Sierra Madre Oriental. Although a general positive correlation between heat flow and radioactive heat generation is observed, adherance to the expected linear patterns cannot be demonstrated. This lack of linearity prohibits the definition of separate thermal provinces in northern Mexico and suggests the assignment of the Sierra Madre Occidental as a southerly extension of the Basin and Range thermal province that is modified by sea floor spreading in the Gulf of California. Heat flow measurements in the states of Chihuahua, Durango, and Zacatecas are similar to those associated with the Rio Grande Rift thermal anomaly in New Mexico, but an indentification of a continuous extension of the rift thermal conditions into northern Mexico cannot be made.","","","Department of Geology, University of Florida, Gainesville, Florida 32611","","","United States","1979-05-10T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: J.

"Thermal conductivity of crystalline rocks associated with energy extraction from hot dry rock geothermal systems","Sibbitt, W L; Dodson, J G; Tester, J W","15 GEOTHERMAL ENERGY; HOT-DRY-ROCK SYSTEMS; THERMAL CONDUCTIVITY; GEOTHERMAL WELLS; HEAT FLOW; MEDIUM TEMPERATURE; MOISTURE; ROCKS; GEOTHERMAL SYSTEMS; PHYSICAL PROPERTIES; THERMODYNAMIC PROPERTIES; WELLS; 152002* - Geothermal Data & Theory- Properties of Minerals & Rocks","Because the lifetime of and heat extraction rate from a hot dry rock (HDR) geothermal reservoir can be substantially controlled by the in situ rock thermal conductivity, information concerning the dependence of thermal conductivity on moisture content and temperature is important for proper design and management of the reservoir. Results of thermal conductivity measurements are given for 14 drill core rock samples taken from two exploratory HDR geothermal wellbores (maximum depth of 2929 m (9608 ft) drilled into Precambrian granitic rock in the Jemez Mountains of northern New Mexico. These samples have been petrographically characterized and in general represent fresh competent Precambrian material of deep origin. Thermal conductivities, modal analyses, and densities are given for all core samples studied under dry and wet ('water-saturated') conditions. A cut bar thermal conductivity comparator and a transient needle probe were used for the determinations with fused quartz and Pyroceram 9606 as the stardards. The maximum temperature range of the measurements was from the ice point to 250/sup 0/C. The measurements on wet rock were limited to the temperature range below room temperature. Conductivity values of the dense core rock samples were generally within the range from 2 to 2.9 W/mK at 200/sup 0/C. Excellent agreement was achieved between these measurements of thermal conductivity and those obtained by in situ measurements run in the HDR wellbores. By using samples of sufficient thickness to provide a statistically representative heat flow path, no difference between conductivity values and their temperature coefficients for orthogonal directions was observed. This isotropic behavior was even found for highly foliated gneissic specimens. Estimates of thermal conductivity based on a dispersion and/or mixture analysis utilizing pure minerallic phase conductivities and detailed modal analyses usually agreed to within 9% of the experimental values.","","","Los Alamos Scientific Laboratory, University of California, Los Alamos, New Mexico 87545","","","United States","1979-03-10T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: J.

Because of the consequent thermal contraction, edge cracks may form within the thermal boundary layer. For a system of equally spaced straight-edge cracks, growing collinearly with increasing thickness of the thermal boundary layer, the average minimum crack spacing is estimated on the basis of: (a) energy consideration; (b) stress consideration; and (c) consideration of stability of the growth of interacting cracks. It is shown that for a given temperature profile, one can develop a general stability chart which, in particular, gives a complete growth regime of the interacting cracks (no crack branching is included).","","","","","","United States","1979-03-01T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: J.

Uniform corrosion, pitting corrosion, and various forms of highly localized, selective attacks were observed. The corrosion product (Fe/sub 3/O/sub 4/) was covered with a transition zone of corrosion product mixed with scale that graded into a scale-rich deposit. The scales, deposited from brine, consisted of heavy metal sulfides dispersed in an Fe-rich, amorphous silicate matrix. The possible roles of the outer scale deposit, the intermediate transition zone, and the inner corrosion product on either abetting or deterring corrosion are discussed. It is proposed that cracks, resulting from thermal stresses induced during periods of intermittent operation, form in the scale, permitting the infusion of oxygen during shutdown intervals. This contributes to localized accelerated pitting, resulting in perforation of the pipe and casing walls. The importance of environmental (pH, E/sub H/, composition, heterogeneity) and material (composition, casting, thermomechanical history, microstructure, surface condition) variables that influence the formation of different pit morphologies is discussed and compared with related observations cited in the literature.","","","Univ. of California, Livermore","","","United States","1979-03-01T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: Corrosion; (United States); Journal Volume: 35:3","","Medium: X; Size: Pages: 114-124","","","","Journal ID: CODEN: CORRA","10.5006/0010-9312-35.3.114","","2016-05-16T00:00:00Z","6318287","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/6318287","","Corrosion; (United States)","","35:3"

The casing was assumed to pass vertically through a planar heat source of constant temperature. The casing and formation were assumed to be in perfect thermal contact. Numerical results were obtained for two sizes of steel casing and one size of aluminum casing. At any given distance from the heat source, the casing temperature differs most at early times from the formation temperature computed in the absence of casing. This difference decreases rapidly with time. Furthermore, the maximum difference occurs at greater distances from the heat source as time increases. In general, after about three months of heating, errors in measured temperatures due to conduction along the casing wall are negligible. 9 references, 7 figures.","","","","","","United States","1979-03-01T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: J.

Limitations of directional drilling and concepts for advanced systems both present and emerging energy technologies are detailed. To be technically and economically feasible methane drainage, in-situ retorting of oil shale, and underground gasification of coal will require directional drilling. Directional drilling is important in geothermal energy production to reduce costs and reduce environmental impacts. Even energy forms such as solar and nuclear are dependent on materials often found and recovered by methods involving directional drilling. Directional drilling is expected to increase significantly in the next decade. With the increase in emphasis on directional drilling will come new down hole systems. These will increase penetration rate, reduce downtime, and enhance safety. Measurement-while-drilling (MWD) systems which allow real-time monitoring of down-hole conditions are now becoming available. Improved down-hole motors hold promise of increased drilling effectiveness by increasing horsepower at the bit, improving bit hydraulics, and reducing drill-string wear. 26 references.","","","","","","United States","1979-02-26T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: Oil Gas J.; (United States); Journal Volume: 77:9","","Medium: X; Size: Pages: 108-112, 117-118, 120, 125","","","","Journal ID: CODEN: OIGJA; TRN: 85-008074","","","2009-12-17T00:00:00Z","5905187","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/5905187","","Oil Gas J.; (United States)","","77:9"

Interpretation of seismic refraction recordings in the area yielded compressional velocities from near the surface to the crystalline basement at a maximum depth of approximately 1600 m. The results show a complex sequence of sediments and volcanic flows overlying basement. Velocities in the sedimentary section vary laterally. Correlation with well data suggests that zones of higher velocities may correspond to zones where sediments are hydrothermally altered. Flowing hot wells occur near the boundary between inferred shallow altered and unaltered rocks. The basement surface does not appear to be displaced by large faults, although there is ample surface evidence of faulting. The deep circulation of hot water necessary for a convective system may be through many small faults and fractures.

Through examination of about 500 analyses of samples from the Imperial Valley, California, supplemented by an additional 8000 analyses from adjacent parts of the Basin and Range province, normal ranges were established for the various chemical geothermal indicators and the criteria by which a geothermal water may be recognized. For the Imperial Valley, California, the following values are proposed as signifying potential geothermal water: silica geotemperature, > 100/sup 0/C; Na-K-Ca geotemperature, > 125/sup 0/C; fluoride, >2.5 ppM; in situ temperature, > 35/sup 0/C; heat flow, > 120 mW m/sup -2/.

This scan outlined at least ten major anomalous areas, including all but one of the six Known Geothermal Resource Areas (KGRAs). The rediscovery of the KGRAs underscores the potential value of WATSTORE as a rapid reconnaissance tool in geothermal exploration. Anomalous areas that are not KGRAs are located east and west of the Salton Sea (Hot Mineral Well and Holly Hot Well), near Coyote Wells, near Camp Dunlap, and east of Brawley.

Onshore temperatures were measured at 1-m intervals in drill holes cased with 0.25-inch PVC pipes and offshore temperatures were obtained with a 2-m lance-like thermal probe (0.50-inch OD) which contains 7 equally spaced thermistor sensors. The gradients range from 0.02/sup 0/ to 1.7/sup 0/C/m and from 0.72/sup 0/ to 4.3/sup 0/C/m in the onshore and offshore areas, respectively. Heat fluxes, calculated from an assumed value of heat capacity, and in-situ determined thermal diffusivities and gradients, decrease away from a chain of four Quaternary volcanic domes, near the present shoreline. Superimposed on this general trend are several sites with high heat flux, reflecting local hydrological influence.

The intrusions exhibit regional variations in magnetic and chemical parameters. Aeromagnetic and ground-magnetic anomalies are highest over dikes in the Carolinas. High amplitude is due primarily to a stronger magnetization (the induced component dominates and is nearly constant within individual intrusions). Effects of host-rock magnetization, thermoremanence, and dike width, attitude, and orientation are insignificant. Chemically the Carolinas dikes are characterized by higher mean values for total iron and relatively low TiO/sub 2/ content. The magnetic and chemical patterns are reminiscent of those found for tholeiitic complexes over oceanic hotspots (Galapagos, Iceland), and suggest that the Carolinas may have been the site of such a feature in Late Triassic--Early Jurassic time. Crustal arching, rifting, and volcanism probably origniated in the Carolinas. Tectonic-volcanic activity gradually migrated northeast (and possibly, southwest) along the Appalachian axis with enlargement of the crustal bulge. In Jurassic time, spreading began farther east; the crustal stress configuration changed, and the tectonic pattern was dominated by the formation of new sets of tensional fractures and sinistral slip along pre-existing faults.","","","Wesleyan Univ., Middletown, CT","","","United States","1979-02-01T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: Geol.

This igneous complex is emplaced in granulite-facies gneisses. These gneisses have a mean density of 2.70 g/cm/sup 3/, indicative of granitic rocks. A Bouguer gravity anomaly map shows no distinctive gravity anomaly over anorthosite, but a sharp 25-mgal positive anomaly is present over the norite syncline. Gravity models indicate that the norite synchline is about 4 km thick and that relatively minor amounts of granitic gneiss are present in the core of the syncline. Anorthosite masses cannot be modeled directly but can be inferred to have a thickness of at least 4 km. Relative amounts of the rock types in the anorthosite complex are anorthosite, 70%; norite, 25%; and granitic rocks, 5%. No evidence is found for a dense mafic residuum that would be formed if the anorthosite differentiated from a basaltic magma in place. If the rocks of the complex are cogenetic, the parent magma would be noritic anorthosite, and the volume of granitic rocks is so small that it would not change the presumed composition of the parent magma appreciably. Heat flow through the anorthosite is so low (0.45 HFU) that mantle heat flow in this area can hardly be greater than 0.2 to 0.3 HFU. Granulitic gneisses or other rocks produced at low heat must compose the entire crust beneath the anorthosite complex.","","","","","","United States","1979-02-01T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: Geol.

The methods suffer from a critical lack of reliability for 2 reasons: (1) the test conditions do not simulate the most critical field conditions; and (2) the analytical parts of these methods are not accurate enough. An elaborate new study of practical scale inhibition is presently in progress that includes both laboratory and field evaluations of scale inhibitors. The main objectives are to develop test procedures and to use these procedures for screening and evaluating large numbers of scale inhibitors. The relevancy of the test procedures and test data for field operations is emphasized. Problems and solutions of efficiency determinations are described. A new test procedure suitable for routine screening of scale inhibitors has been developed. Thirty-four scale inhibitors are presently being screened using this new procedure. 19 references.","","","","","","United States","1979-01-01T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: Soc.

At 360/sup 0/ and 465/sup 0/C, there are no indications of rate effects influencing isotope partitioning, but at 265/sup 0/C (where fractionation factors show an unusally large scatter) the evidence is inconclusive in this respect.

The temperature-dependence of fractionation in the range 265/sup 0/ to 465/sup 0/C is given by the equation 10/sup 3/ ln ..cap alpha..(SiO/sub 2/--H/sub 2/O) = 3.05 x 10/sup 6/T/sup -2/ - 2.09.

Hydrothermal activity has persisted at this location for a least 1 x 10/sup 6/ years based on the distribution of hydrothermal and hydrogenous mineralization with respect to crustal age. The hydrothermal activity has been cyclic, multistage, and episodic. Prior high-temperature hydrothermal venting stages with a periodicity of the order of 1 x 10/sup 4/ years and duration of the order of 10/sup 1/ years are deduced from the estimated ages of discrete sedimentary layers anomalously enriched in Cu, Fe, and Zn and correspond with the independently determined periodicity of volcanic eruptive cycles on the Mid-Atlantic Ridge. The most recent episode of high-temperature venting is inferred to have ceased in the recent past based on metal enrichment (Cu, Fe, Zn) in the surficial sediment layer. Low-temperature hydrothermal venting stages with a duration of the order of 1 x 10/sup 4/ years intervene between the short high-temperature stages and produce stratiform deposits of layered and earthy manganese oxide, iron oxide, hydroxide and silicate.

The resulting heat flow profile includes an increase from basin values in the eastern Venezuelan basin and a zone of high values extending the length of the transect. Superimposed on this zone are two heat flow peaks containing maximum values, one at the Aves swell and the other at the Lesser Antilles arc. Based on 21 acceptable values, average heat flows were 1.87 heat flow units (1 HFU=1 ..mu..cal cm/sup -2/s/sup -1/) (8 values) for basin regions, 3.63 HFU (9 values) for the Aves swell peak, and 4.16 HFU (4 values) for the Lesser Antilles are peak. High heat flow is expected for the Lesser Antilles arc, the present site of seismic and volcanic activity associated with subduction of the North American plate at the West Indies trench. The heat flow peak at the Aves swell agrees with an island arc formation for this presently inactive feature, with its high heat flow anomaly attributed to radiogenic heat sources concentrated during subduction in the past. Both the Aves swell and the Lesser Antilles arc are believed to be heated by radiogenic sources accumulated during past subduction, but only the Lesser Antilles arc is now receiving new heat from mechanical processes directly coupled to active underthrusting. This suggests that differences in the two heat flow peaks at the Aves swell and Lesser Antilles arc reflect the relative importance of different heat-producing mechanisms at island arcs.","","","Curriculum in Marine Sciences, University of North Carolina, Chapel Hill, North Carolina 27514","","","United States","1978-12-10T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: J.

The process used to convert underground hot water into power was developed and funded entirely by a small, innovative company, Magnum Power, which also produces geothermal power from dry steam at its Geysers plant in northern California. The method used was designed by J.G. Hilbert, known as the father of Ocean Thermal Energy Conservation. A synthetic refrigerant is used to drive the turbine rather than steam from the hot water, so that the process largely eliminates the corrosion problems which have constituted a major drawback to using geothermal hot water for power production. According to Magnum Power, it will be possible to build hot water powerplants for less than $600/kw, well under half the cost of a nuclear plant. Hot water plants will probably always be relatively small, producing about 50 Mw, enough to provide the power needs of a city of 50,000.

The spectrum below 200 Hz is fairly flat and the signal strength is sufficient for operation throughout the year. Above 200 Hz and centered near 2 kHz, an absorptive band limits the signal strength making data acquisition difficult if not impossible in the mid-band region, particularly during the winter months. The spectra also show that power line harmonics may be very strong to about 1000 Hz and can be 30 to 50 dB above the natural signal level. Histograms of the measured apparent resistivities at 7.5 and 27 Hz for all measurement locations within the Basin and Range and Columbia Plateau physiographic provinces indicate a narrow distribution for the Basin and Range, while a broader distribution characterizes the Columbia Plateau.

The east and west boundaries of the survey were the topographic limits of the valley. The quadripole resistivity method consists of sequentially energizing two orthogonal bipole sources with a square wave of electric current and measuring the resultant electric fields with a pair of orthogonal wire receivers. Two resultant electric fields are measured and by combining them in different proportions, their resultant can be made to rotate through 360 degrees. By performing this procedure, an ellipse of resistivity can be calculated at each measurement location. The arithmetic mean of the maximum and minimum axes of the ellipse is a tensor invariant resistivity. It was this value which was used to define the variation of electrical resistivity over the Imperial Valley. The quadripole survey of the Imperial Valley was undertaken to compare its known geothermal fields with previously unsurveyed areas. The results show that the geothermal fields of the Imperial Valley have distinctive resistivity characteristics. A large circular area south of the city of Brawley was found which has the same characteristics as the known geothermal fields. From the resistivity data, it is predicted that this south Brawley resistivity anomaly represents a geothermal field which will produce water with a temperature of approximately 200/sup 0/C and with a salinity between 20,000 and 50,000 ppM.

The gravity data indicate the approximate thickness of the Cenozoic rocks and location of the larger normal faults, and the aeromagnetic data indicate the extent of the major Cenozoic volcanic units. The relative ellipse area contour map compiled from the telluric current survey generally conforms to the gravity map except for lower values in the area of the geothermal system. An area of low apparent resistivity values defined by the audiomagnetotelluric (AMT) survey appears to outline the extent of the geothermal reservoir even though the reservoir is deeper than the penetration of the survey. Self-potential anomalies relate to near surface hydrology. The Raft River Valley is underlain by about 2 km of Cenozoic rock, most of which is Tertiary sediments of the Salt Lake formation. On the west side of the valley the Tertiary rocks appear to be separated from the underlying Precambrian basement by a low angle fault along which the Tertiary rocks have slid off a buried basement dome. Subsequent normal faults displace both the basement surface and the Tertiary beds. The geothermal system occurs where these north-trending faults intersect a poorly understood northeast-trending zone that may be a basement shear zone. Apparently deep circulating water at a temperature of about 150/sup 0/C rises in the area of this intersection and then spreads laterally in porous zones near the base of the Tertiary rocks to form the geothermal reservoir. Upward leakage from the reservoir produces shallower effects that were measured by the AMT survey.","","","Geological Survey, Denver, CO","","","United States","1978-12-01T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: Geophysics; (United States); Journal Volume: 43:7","","Medium: X; Size: Pages: 1470-1484","","","","Journal ID: CODEN: GPYSA","10.1190/1.1440909","","2016-05-26T00:00:00Z","6149280","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/6149280","","Geophysics; (United States)","","43:7"

The heat-flow distribution is related to the combined effects of crustal thermal refraction and a large, transient crustal heat source. A regional model consistent with the heat-flow pattern and other geophysical and geological data is described which assumes the emplacement of a large heat source (mafic intrusion) under the western Snake River Plain about 10 to 15 m.y. ago. An anomaly of about 0.3 ..mu..cal/cm/sup 2/ sec is predicted over the center of the heat source at the present time. The timing of the emplacement of the heat source corresponds with the age of voluminous silicic volcanism in the western Snake River Plain. A time-progressive thermal model is presented for the Snake River Plain which is consistent with the time progression of silicic volcanism. Based on the model, higher regional heat-flow values are predicted for the eastern Snake River Plain. Confirmation of the high regional heat-flow values is not possible in the boreholes available (200 +- m deep) because of regional circulation of cold groundwater in the Snake Plain Aquifer. However, a close correlation between integrated crustal and upper mantle temperature and observed elevation changes along the axis of the Snake River Plain is strong support for the heat-flow model. The possibility of high heat flow in the eastern part of the Snake River Plain implies that the area may have significant geothermal potential in spite of the low surface heat flow. The regional aseismic warping observed in the eastern Snake River Plain can be interpreted as a thermal contraction phenomenon involving the crust and upper mantle.","","","","","","United States","1978-12-01T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: Geol.

The low resistivity of this zone is probably due to intensely fractured and altered water-saturated rock. A zone of resistivity 12 ..cap omega..-m extending to the west of the dome fault is probably due to leakage of brine away from the geothermal system through alluvium or moderately altered rock. A resistive basement underlies the conductive zones and is believed to be essentially nonporous and unaltered rock. A major problem in the application of one-dimensional (1-D) modeling of Schlumberger data in the Roosevelt Hot Springs KGRA is poor resolution of the 1-D parameters. The joint inversion of Schlumberger and electromagnetic sounding data gives a least-squares 1-D conductivity model in which parameters are much better resolved than are the model parameters estimated by the inversion of Schlumberger data alone. One-dimensional modeling of Schlumberger soundings along a traverse does indicate the presence of a 2-D inhomogeneity but gives no hint of the possible complexity of that inhomogeneity even though the parameters of the models fitting each sounding have acceptable standard deviations when constrained by electromagnetic sounding data. Since the model parameter standard deviations are model dependent,good resolution of 1-D model parameters does not indicate that the assumption of a 1-D model is valid. On the other hand, the possible compexity of structure is brought out by 2-D modeling of the same data, but since the degrees of freedom for complex 2-D models is large, a thorough study of the resolution of such models is prohibitively costly at present. In these circumstances, one must constrain the 2-D models with independent geologic or geophysical data and then accept the subsequent best-fit model as semiquantitative.","","","","","","United States","1978-12-01T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: Geophysics; (United States); Journal Volume: 43:7","","Medium: X; Size: Pages: 1450-1469","","","","Journal ID: CODEN: GPYSA","10.1190/1.1440908","","2016-04-19T00:00:00Z","6218137","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/6218137","","Geophysics; (United States)","","43:7"

Water moving vertically from deep-heated crustal rock along faults and then moving horizontally into relatively shallow basin-fill deposits seems to be the most probable explanation for the irregular but widespread occurrence of thermal ground water in the study area. 4 figures, 1 table.","","","Oil and Gas Commission, Phoenix, AZ","","","United States","1978-12-01T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: Interstate Oil Compact Comm.

A comparative study by California's Air Resources Board of oil vs. coal power generation is cited which claims coal power plant particulate and SO/sub 2/ emissions can be reduced to one-tenth those of oil-fired plants. This indicates that California may be able to use coal in the future. Also, recent progress in the pursuit of clean, alternative energy sources is discussed. For example, additions to power stations at the Geysers are expected to yield 1350 Mw by 1985. Also, a 10 Mw solar power tower is being constructed near Barstow, and a 55% tax credit on solar projects is in effect. Out-of-state sources of power for the early 1980's are also explored.","","","","","","United States","1978-11-16T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: Eng.

In detail, both the gravity and the magnetic anomalies are a complex of highs and lows, in contrast to the simpler anomalies over the western Snake River Plain. The broad gravity high associated with the eastern Snake River Plain cannot be produced by a dense mass at shallow depth under the plain, but must be produced either by a deep feature under the plain or by a broader, shallower feature extending well beyond the plain. The high could be produced by a thinning of the crust under the plain by 4.5 to 7 kilometers. The data suggest that the Cenozoic rocks of the plain are underlain by rocks that have density and magnetization similar to the density and magnetization of the pre-Cenozoic rocks north and south of the plain. The data do not suggest rifting of the upper crust such as is inferred for the western Snake River Plain. The plain is in approximate isostatic equilibrium with adjoining regions to the north and south and thus contrasts with the adjoining areas where the basin-and-range topography is not in isostatic equilibrium. The local gravity anomalies on the plain are probably produced by variations in the thickness of Cenozoic rocks, but the wavelength of the anomalies is about twice that of the basin-and-range structural features in areas adjoining the plain. The gravity expression of basin-and-range structural features does not extend far onto the plain.Magnetic anomalies on the plain are produced by Cenozoic volcanic rocks.","","","","","","United States","1978-09-01T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: J.

The technique is applicable to both subsonic and supersonic single component flow in which normal shock waves may occur, and is the basis for a two-dimensional model. The flow is assumed to be inviscid except for droplet drag. Temperature and pressure equilibrium between phases is assumed, although this is not a requirement of the technique. Example calculations of flow in one-dimensional nozzles with and without normal shocks are given and compared with experimentally measured pressure profiles for both low quality and high quality two-phase steam-water flow.","","","","","","United States","1978-09-01T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: J.

The consortium plans to spend $3.2 million over three years to build the plant at a proven geothermal site. Only one ton of nodules per day will be treated in the pilot plant. Steam from the well will generate electricity to prepare the metals for extraction, while hot brine will be tapped for direct steam use. Condensate will be used in the processing also and cooled brine will be used for slurry transport of nodules and waste water. The wellhead steam pressure of 1000 pounds will emit considerable noise. Private businesses have expressed interest, although there are no commercial facilities planned at present. Seabed mining combined with geothermal power is expected to become commercially attractive as Congress establishes policies for developing ocean mining techniques. Support for the project has come from both the state and local governments and the populace.","","","","","","United States","1978-08-14T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: Energy User News; (United States); Journal Volume: 3:33","","Medium: X; Size: Pages: 13","","","","Journal ID: CODEN: EUSND","","","2009-12-17T00:00:00Z","6636231","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/6636231","","Energy User News; (United States)","","3:33"

Survey flights with the instrument over an exposed hydrothermal alteration zone in Gold-field, Nevada provide the high-spectral resolution and spatially correlated data necessary to establish a computerized technique for spectral discrimination of limonitic zones that could indicate mineralization. The data generated by the airbonre system are used, in particular, to determine the spectral properties of alteration materials as they appear in integrated measurements over extended field areas, to determine which spectral properties are unique under field conditions and will remain unique in the low-spectral resolution Landsat data, and to determine accurately the nature and magnitude of the relative spectral differences among geologic targets under the broadband configuration. Field measurements from the aircraft are spatially integrated over contiguous 18 m square fields-of-view along traverses flown to cover both background and altered rock assemblages. A small spectral signal unique to zones enriched in ferric iron minerals is recoverable in the aircraft data. Based on a differential spectral discriminant, a computer-compatible method has been devised to extract the ferric iron signal from atmospheric and background terrain and geologically induced variations in Landsat data. 8 figures.","","","Goddard Space Flight Center, New York, NY","","","United States","1978-08-01T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: Geophysics; (United States); Journal Volume: 43:5","","Medium: X; Size: Pages: 967-987","","","","Journal ID: CODEN: GPYSA","10.1190/1.1440877","","2016-04-26T00:00:00Z","5073288","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/5073288","","Geophysics; (United States)","","43:5"

These hydrothermal systems included the Great Boiling springs and Mud springs at Gerlach, the Fly Ranch hot springs in Hualapai Flat, Double Hot and Black Rock springs at the southern end of the Black Rock Range, Trego hot spring, Soldier Meadows hot springs, and hot springs at Pinto Mt., at Pyramid Lake Needles region, and in the San Emidio and Smoke Creek Deserts. Thermal and nonthermal groundwater was analyzed to determine the water quality of the various hot spring regions. Water discharged from the hot springs of Trego, Gerlach, San Emidio and Smoke Creek Deserts, and Pyramid Lake Needles area is classified as Na--Cl. This water is characterized by high values of Na/sup +/, Cl/sup -/, HCO/sub 3//sup -/, and SiO/sub 2/ and is neutral in pH. Water discharged from the hot springs of Soldier Meadows, Pinto Mt., Double Hot springs, and Fly Ranch hot springs is classified as Na--HCO/sub 3/. This water is similar to the nonthermal water of these areas, and probably represents circulation of meteoric water near a heat source, with very little addition of magma-derived fluids. The similarities of the trilinear plots of the chemical quality of nonthermal and thermal waters suggest the origin of the thermal waters is deep circulation of meteoric water with the addition of some connate water. Based on the use of the silica, Na/K, and Na--K--Ca geothermometers, the Great Boiling springs at Gerlach appears to be the most promising geothermal prospect in the study area. The sub-surface temperature calculated for this area was 175 to 200/sup 0/C. The springs along the eastern edge of the San Emidio Desert have the greatest potential for yielding commercial geothermal fluids based on a geochemical temperature of 216/sup 0/C. Hualapai Flat (Fly Ranch) contains a large number of hot springs, but temperatures of the reservoir based on geochemistry ranged from 125 to 155/sup 0/C.","","","","","","United States","1978-07-01T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: Q.

One of the major problems faced was the development of a flexible, electrically insulating seal that could withstand high temperatures without the deficiencies of Teflon and Rulan. The Ag/AgCl electrode is reversible at temperatures up to at least 120/sup 0/C. A salt bridge protects the electrode from species in the geothermal fluids that could disturb the poential, and an insulating shell keeps out H and H/sub 2/S. The electrodeless conductivity probe consists of two toroidally wound coils, one driven by a pulsing DC voltage and one acting as a receiver. The current induced between the two coils is proportional to the conductivity of the medium.

The volcanic activity is far too old (23 my) to act as a source of heat in the area. Metasedimentary, granitic, volcanic, and alluvial clastic rocks may act as geothermal reservoirs. Thick lacustrine clays and alluvial-fluvial sediments as well as thick tuffaceous units have strong thermal insulating or cap rock properties. The location of the Gerlach hot springs is controlled by quasiradial spreading effected by contemporaneous activity on intersecting major regional normal faults. The location of Fly Ranch hot springs is also fault controlled and in addition is associated with modern tectonic rifting.

Japan has four potential types of geothermal resources: natural dry steam, high-enthalpy thermal water in volcanic areas; low-enthalpy thermal water in sedimentary basins in non-volcanic regions; hot dry rock; and volcanic heat. Among these, the high-enthalpy thermal water in volcanic areas is of the greatest interest at present because most of Japanese geothermal resources are distributed in a big volcano-tectonic depressed region which was formed in the Miocene period. The depressed region is filled mainly with Neogene tertiary volcanic rocks in thicknesses of one or two kilometers and overlain by the clusters of volcanic cones of Quaternary age. Such a structure is apparently conducive to the formation of high-enthalpy thermal water which requires a reservoir structure and a sufficient supply of heat and water. National reserves of the natural dry steam and high-enthalpy thermal water, which may be utilized for commercial power generation, are calculated to be more than ten million kW for at least a thousand years taking into account only production wells not deeper than 1.5 km. It is demonstrated that prospecting hereafter should be focused on the deeply seated geothermal resources which may occur in pre-Miocene fractured sedimentary rocks hidden beneath the Miocene volcanic rocks of the Neogene volcano-tectonic depressed area in Japan. 39 references.","","","Geological Survey of Japan, Kawasaki-shi, Japan","","","United States","1978-07-01T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: Energy Dev.

Extension of these features within fracturable rocks beneath thermally insulating layers may point up locations of hidden geothermal reservoirs.","","","","","","United States","1978-07-01T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: Q.

In general, alteration is that to be expected when hot, slightly acid, aqueous solutions come in contact with rocks of granodiorite composition. Silicification is widespread in alteration, indicating silica has been introduced. However, this silica need not have a deep-seated source, but could have been derived locally.

The rift widens irregularly southward from a narrow horst in Colorado into a broad collapsed vault, characterized by grabens, in southern New Mexico. Whether manifested by horsts or grabens, primarily extensional strain is involved which increases in magnitude southward. Extensional faulting along the rift occurred in Neogene to Quaternary time, but the rift follows an axis of Laramide, Pennsylvanian, and possibly earlier uplifts. Gravity gradients due to the low density of graben fill delineate major faults of the rift system, which show a gridded or en echelon pattern over distances of tens of kilometers. Aeromagnetic data show these faults to be aligned with basement structural grain. Zigzags hundreds of kilometers long in the trend of the rift may also be related to basement grain. Basement trends in the Colorado Plateau to the west seem to differ in direction from those in the High Plains to the east. Seismic data also show that the rift occurs in an area of transition between anomalous crustal and upper mantle structure typical of the Cordillera and crustal structure typical of the High Plains. Deep seismic data are sparse within the rift, but high heat flow, high elevation, high electrical conductivity, and both residual positive (shallow source) and negative (deep source) gravity anomalies suggest the presence of symmetrical anomalous crustal and upper-mantle structure along the axis of the rift. In the Socorro area, where the rift has been studied intensively, available data indicate relatively low compressional velocity, rapid Holocene uplift, and the presence of magma within the crust. In view of geomorphic evidence for widespread Holocene faulting, the seismicity of the rift is surprisingly low.","","","Geological Survey, Denver, CO","","","United States","1978-07-01T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: Geol.

Each alteration zone is characterized by the dominance of a particular mineral: zone 1, montmorillonite; zone 2, chlorite; zone 3, actinolite. Three zones of relative permeability can be tentatively identified on the basis of filled versus partly filled vesicles and fractures. Because the well has not returned to thermal equilibrium as of this writing, stability relations between secondary minerals and temperatures cannot be calculated with accuracy. However, the latest downhole temperatures measured at the boundaries of alteration zones, compared with similar data from high-temperature geothermal areas in Iceland, indicate that HGP-A temperatures are considerably higher than those encountered for the same alteration-zone boundaries in Icelandic wells. This indicates that the present-day thermal regime in HGP-A is relatively young and that the hydrothermal minerals probably have not reached equilibrium with existing conditions.","","","Hawaii Inst. of Geophysics, Honolulu","","","United States","1978-07-01T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: Geology; (United States); Journal Volume: 6:7","","Medium: X; Size: Pages: 401-404","","","","Journal ID: CODEN: GLGYB","10.1130/0091-7613(1978)6<401:HAOBFH>2.0.CO;2","","2016-05-24T00:00:00Z","6723160","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/6723160","","Geology; (United States)","","6:7"

Major constraints between the developer and the utility (including the large front-end field investment, reservoir guarantees, base-load reliability, resource utilization, and utility financing) justify the strategy of starting small in order to develop an equity market for financing geothermal capability. To do this, a new capital base must be designed that can coordinate a geothermal resource from wellhead to sale of power to the utility. The utility could then schedule the load requirements and plan financing accordingly.

Uses suggested for the heated, pressurized water are as process heat in industrial and commercial operations, for generation of electricity directly, and for extraction of methane in sufficient quantities from the water. It is felt that, unlike exploitation of petroleum resources, the main problems will be encountered not in the exploration stage but after well completion and production begins. The geopressured well will produce large volumes of water and drain a very large area. These large volumes of water must be disposed after use. A legal dilemma resulting from study of the exploration and use of this resource is raised but not resolved. This dilemma concerns whether a decision on the extent of modification of existing leasing patterns and utilization or spacing provisions for wells should be made now on the basis of preliminary data concerning the resource development or whether the decision should be delayed until development of the resource has begun and a better understanng of the resource and problems related to its development are better understood.

An array of geophones would be set up to record near-field wave motion resulting from diffraction by the inhomogeneity. As an example of such inhomogeneities, the diffraction of plane P and S waves was studied by a finite two-dimensional crack as a function of wavelength and direction of incident wave. A method that can be used to solve for diffraction effects by empty and fluid-filled (zero viscosity) cracks was developed. The diffraction problem was solved using the finite difference scheme developed by Madariaga (1976) to study dynamic crack propagation problems. The results of the theoretical calculation are used to try to locate the edge of a magma lens in Kilauea Iki Crater, Hawaii. It was found that the ratio of vertical-to-horizontal displacement and the direction of rotation of initial particle motion measured by a seismic array located on the floor of the crater agree qualitatively with what the theory predicts. The edge of the magma found by this method shows excellent agreement with the one inferred from the distribution of seismic events originating in the crust of tha lava lake (Aki et al., 1977).","","","Massachusetts Inst. of Tech., Cambridge","","","United States","1978-06-01T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: Bull.

Such a flow is of practical interest in multiple-disk turbomachinery, and specifically is a model of a two-phase, single component flow (saturated vapor--saturated liquid steam) which would arise in geothermal applications of a multiple-disk turbine. Local mass conservation and momentum equations for the vapor and droplet fields were used, as well as mass conservation and energy equations for a single droplet. The vapor--droplet interaction was modeled by a drag force based on the well-known drag coefficients for flow past spheres. The governing equations were reduced to parabolic form by order-of-magnitude arguments to allow a marching-type solution. The nonlinear partial differential equations were replaced by nonlinear finite-difference equations, which were linearized. The resulting system of linear algebraic equations was solved directly. Various results are presented, including results for a set of flow parameters which are close to those applicable for multiple-disk turbines operating on geothermal steam.","","","Arizona State Univ., Tempe","","","United States","1978-06-01T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: J.

The potassium atoms were introduced at the center of the furnace by diffusion through an orifice in sample cells which we developed for vapor pressure measurement. We have shown both experimentally and theoretically that, at a particular temperature, the absorbance we measure is proportional to the rate of diffusion of potassium atoms from the vapor pressure sample cells. For a particular cell with a particular orifice, there is a temperature-dependent conversion factor between absorbance and pressure which we evaluated from measurements with potassium aluminate standards in the cells.

Using available values for equilibrium constants, the activities of 26 chemical species involving the major components of the reservoir water were calculated and quantitative evaluations of solute/solute, mineral/solute chemical equilibria in these geothermal systems were made. The unflashed reservoir water is just saturated with calcite. The saline geothermal waters, which represent heated sea-water, are just saturated with anhydrite, but the dilute waters, which are of meteoric origin, are somewhat undersaturated with this mineral. The fluoride mobility is thought to be limited by an ionic exchange reaction where F/sup -/ replaces some of the OH/sup -/ in the layered silicates. The pH of the unflashed reservoir water is governed by ionic exchange equilibrium in which all the major cations participate. At a given temperature it seems likely that the activity of one cation fixes the activities of all the other major cations and hydrogen ion. If this is so, and we take all the other chemical equilibria which have been demonstrated to exist for granted, it turns out that the major element composition of the unflashed high-temperature geothermal waters is controlled by two independent variables only. These variables are the temperature and the supply to the water of the incompatible element chlorine, incompatible indicating that this element is not incorporated in the geothermal minerals.","","","National Energy Authority, Reykjavik, Iceland","","","United States","1978-05-01T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: Geochim.

Steep-walled linear ridges 30 m high, trending 060/sup 0/, and composed of lava pillows and narrow fissures with the same strike were the principal volcanic features observed on the ridge crest. Lava tunnels, tubes, and pillows frequently were observed to be partially broken through, thereby exposing water-filled voids, which are inferred to be interconnected to great depths within the extrusive submarine volcanic pile. Low compressional wave velocities reported by other authors for the crustal layer composed of submarine volcanic extrusives and the low effective density of this layer, as determined from published surface gravity observations, are attributed to the large intraflow and interflow porosity of submarine volcanic terrain. Areal variations in heat flow through the crust of submarine volcanic features are also attributed to the high porosity and consequent permeability of submarine volcanic terrain which is likely to persist to the bottom of the submarine extrusive pile.","","","","","","United States","1978-04-01T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: Geol.

This mid-Miocene rift, with its associated aeromagnetic anomaly, indicates S68/sup 0/W-N68/sup 0/E (+-5/sup 0/) extension. A small strike-slip (transform) fault at Sawtooth dike, one short element of the rift, confirms the mid-Miocene extension direction. The present extension, based on data throughout the Basin and Range province, is N65/sup 0/W-S65/sup 0/E (+-20/sup 0/), which is consistent with younger fault offsets of the rift. In the Sawtooth dike region this 45/sup 0/ change in direction of extension took place between 15 and 6 m.y. B.P. The Nevada rift is thought to be a part of a linear rift zone roughly 700 km long, which includes feeder dikes of Columbia River basalts and the mid-Miocene location of the Yellowstone hot spot. Extension in this zone was probably perpendicular to a then-active trench along the western plate margin.

In addition, geothermal power plants can produce their own cooling water from steam condensate. Nevertheless, the relatively high water requirements of geothermal facilities along with a series of real and potential constraints may cause water supply dilemmas involving both the acquisition and use of cooling water.

Initial eruptions resulted in two low-viscosity lava flows of nonporphyritic rhyolite. These were followed by bedded pumice falls and nonwelded ash flows. The youngest activity produced at least nine viscous domes and small lava flows of rhyolite that contain 1 to 5 percent phenocrysts of quartz, plagioclase, sodic sanidine, and biotite; distinction between domes and eroded flow segments locally is difficult. Potassium-argon ages indicate that all the rhyolite of the Mineral Mountains was erupted between 0.8 and 0.5 m.y. ago. The rhyolite rests on dissected granite of the Mineral Mountains pluton, the largest intrusion in Utah, which has yielded published K-Ar ages of 9 and 15 m.y. A small older dissected rhyolite dome, about 8 m.y. old, occurs just west of the range front. Whether the young ages of the pluton represent time of intrusion or of later reheating, they, in conjunction with the Pleistocene rhyolite in the Mineral Mountains, do indicate a major late Cenozoic thermal anomaly, the size and age of which is significant to evaluation of the Roosevelt KGRA. The rhyolite is also the only known source of implement-grade obsidian in the southwest between eastern California and northern New Mexico.","","","","","","United States","1978-01-01T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: J.

The time rate of decline in heat transfer performance increases as the brine was cooled from 350 to 150 F. Scale deposition, indicated by the heat transfer coefficient, is a strong function of the brine temperature level and brine velocity. Brine-side pressure loss in the heat exchanger test unit was not significantly affected by the thin, uniform scale layer observed on tube surfaces exposed to geothermal brine. Chemical cleaning effectively removed the scale layer developed on tube surfaces after continuous exposure to the geothermal brine for 560 hr.

The basal strata of the Great Valley sequence consist of thick breccias of mafic clasts, identical in composition to the upper part of the ophiolite. These breccias and their contact relations suggest that more than 1 km of the upper part of the ophiolite was locally eroded in early Tithonian time. On the basis of their radiolarian faunas, cherts in the Franciscan assemblage below the ophiolite range in age from Late Jurassic (early Tithonian) to Late Cretaceous (early Cenomanian). Of particular significance is an individual chert body (=The Geysers chert) of this age range. The early Cenomanian radiolarians, except for two occurrences associated with pelagic limestone, are significantly younger than those previously reported from the Franciscan assemblage. The existence of a sequence of Late Jurassic to Late Cretaceous radiolarian chert places critical constraints on subduction models for emplacement of the Franciscan assemblage beneath the Coast Range ophiolite and Great Valley sequence in The Geysers--Clear Lake area. From early Tithonian to post-early Cenomanian time, the Franciscan assemblage received pelagic sedimentation far from any site of subduction. By other data, blueschist metamorphism of subducted Franciscanstrata also occurred during this time. The radiolarian data from The Geysers area permit a correlation with Upper Cretaceous pelagic limestones in the Laytonville area northwest of The Geysers and also imply that the Great Valley sequence was never depositionally in contact with the Franciscan assemblage.","","","","","","United States","1978-01-01T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: J.

The discharge contains high concentrations of radon, and the gross alpha activity and the concentration of radium 226 exceed maximum levels recommended by the Environmental Protection Agency for drinking water. Part of the discharge is diverted for space heating, bathing, and domestic use. The radioactive thermal waters at measured temperatures of about 60/sup 0/C are of the sodium bicarbonate type and saturated with respect to calcium carbonate. Radium-226 in the rock and on fractured surfaces or coprecipitated with calcium carbonate probably is the principal source of radon that is dissolved in the thermal water and discharged with other gases from some wells and springs. Local surface water and shallow ground water are of the calcium bicarbonate type and exhibit low background activity. The temperature, percent sodium, and radioactivity of mixed waters adjacent to the fault zone increase with depth. Samples from most of the major hot springs in southwestern Montana have been analyzed for gross alpha and beta activity. The high level of radioactivity at Alhambra appears to be related to leaching of radioactive material from fractured siliceous veins by ascending thermal waters and is not a normal characteristic of hot springs issuing from fractured crystalline rock in Montana.","","","","","","United States","1978-01-01T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: J.

The concentration of dissolved iron in water in a well increased from 80 ..mu..g/l (micrograms per liter) before a nearby lagoon was used for disposal of effluent to 17,000 ..mu..g/l after the lagoon was used. The effluent contained 180 ..mu..g/l of dissolved iron, and nearby Iron Spring Creek contained 30 ..mu..g/l or less of dissolved iron above and below the lagoons. Organic carbon, nitrogen, and sulfur in the effluent as methane, ammonia, and hydrogen sulfide are oxidized to carbon dioxide, nitrate, and sulfate, respectively, in the unsaturated zone and possibly in the saturated zone as ground water moves through sand and gravel toward Iron Spring Creek. This oxidation results in simultaneous reduction of iron in the sand and gravel from the insoluble ferric phase to the soluble ferrous phase. As ground water high in dissolved iron discharges at land surface near the stream, oxygen from the atmosphere oxidizes the iron back to the insoluble ferric phase, and ferric hydroxide precipitates. Ferric hydroxide also precipitates in some of the monitoring wells.

The primary data consist of temperatures measured in 13 cored drill holes as drilling progressed. Some temperatures plot convincingly on straight-line segments that suggest conductive gradients in rocks of nearly constant thermal conductivity. Temperature gradients and the conductive component of total heat flow nearly always decrease drastically downward; the gradient and heat flow of the lowest depth interval recognized in each hole is commonly only about 10% of the highest interval; the changes in gradient at interval boundaries are commonly interpreted as channels of near-boiling water or of cooler meteoric water. Temperature reversals are probably related to inflowing cooler water rather than to transient effects from recent changes. Some temperatures plot on curved segments that probably indicate dispersed convective upflow and boiling of water in ground penetrated by the drill hole. Other similar curved segments are too low in temperature for local boiling and are probably on the margins of hot upflow zones, reflecting conductive cooling of flowing water. The conifers of Yellowstone National Park (mainly lodgepole pine) seem to have normal growth characteristics wherenear-surface conductive heat flow is below about 200 heat-flow units (1 HFU = 10/sup -6/ cal/cm/sup 2/ . s = 41.8 mW/m/sup 2/). Most areas of abnormal ''stunted'' trees (low ratio of height to base diameter, and low density of spacing) are characterized by conductive heat flows of about 250 to 350 HFU. The critical factor affecting growth is probably the seasonal maximum soil temperature at the root depths preferred by each form, rather than the heat flow as such. Heat flows up to 300 HFU are greatly dominated near the surface by conduction and are little affected by convection within the measured intervals.","","","","","","United States","1978-01-01T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: J.

Geothermal sources of energy in some form or another are available in many parts of the world, including the major consuming countries. Fundamentally, new technologies to tap these resources are not required. The cost aspects of most geothermal production schemes are the crucial issue. In particular drilling costs are high in comparison with the energy content of well production. Although various agencies such as the U.S. Energy Research and Development Administration and French governmental bodies have expressed their aim to make geothermal energy an economically competitive energy option in the eighties, it is seriously doubted whether this can be accomplished. For the near future, thermal anomolies, usually in connection with recent tectonic, i.e. vulcanic activities, will remain the major targets for geothermal energy production. High-temperature shallow geothermal reservoirs keep drilling costs within economic limits. However, by concentrating on anomalous geothermal conditions only marginal, although locally important contributions to the energy supply can be made. Meanwhile, exploration for the more common deeper hot water reservoirs and hot basement rocks should be pursued so that a reliable inventory of reserves can be obtained and production activities on a larger scale can start when needed.","","","Shell Exploratie en Produktie Laboratorium, Rijswijk, Holland","","","United States","1978-01-01T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: Oil Gas--Eur.

The area consists of a series of basins and intervening ranges formed during Miocene time. This basin-and-range structure is strongly reflected in the Bouguer gravity anomalies, which range from -125 mgal over unlifts to -190 mgal over basins. Lineaments in trends of gravity anomalies are oblique to the predominant north-south trend of the rift and suggest that, in detail, the crust broke upon fractures oblique to the large-scale north-south trend. Thicknesses of Cenozoic sediments, determined from gravity measurements, range from 2 to 3 km in basins. The gravity effect of sediments is removed by stripping, and a broad +30-mgal gravity anomaly is located over the rift. Regional and residual Bouguer gravity anomaly maps were constructed. The source of the 30-mgal gravity high is interpreted to ba a shallow slab of basalt or a deep upwarp of the mantle that results in crustal attenuation. The low-velocity zone may project up toward the base of the crust under the Basin and Range province. Experiments and the observed fault pattern suggest an extensional origin for the Rio Grande rift fracture system.","","","Univ. of Wyoming, Laramie","","","United States","1978-01-01T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: Geol.

Three separate regimes may be identified: (1) dry (drained), in which fluid in cracks can flow out of bulk regions of compression, (2) saturated isobaric, in which fluid may flow from one crack to another but no bulk flow takes place, and (3) saturated isolated, in which there is no communication of fluid between cracks. Transitions between these cases involve fluid flow, resulting in dissipation of energy. Relaxation of shear stresses in viscous fluid inclusions also results in dissipation. Viscoelastic moduli are derived, by using a self-consistent approximation, that describe the complete range of behavior. There are two characteristic frequencies near which dissipation is largest and the moduli change rapidly with frequency. The first corresponds to fluid flow between cracks, and its value can be estimated from the crack geometry or permeability. The second corresponds to the relaxation of shear stress in an isolated viscous fluid inclusion: its value may also be estimated. Variations of crack geometry result in a distribution of characteristic frequencies and cause Q to be relatively constant over many decades of frequency. Fluid flow between cracks account for attenuation of seismic waves in water-saturated rocks and attenuation observed in laboratory measurements on water-saturated rocks and partially molten aggregates. Attenuation in a partially molten upper mantle is probably due to fluid flow between cracks, although grain boundary relaxation in an unmelted upper mantle could also account for the seismic low-velocity zone. Grain boundary relaxation in the mantle may cause the long-term shear modulus to be around 20% less than that measured from seismic observations.","","","Department of Geological Sciences and Center for Earth and Planetary Science, Harvard University, Cambridge, Massachusetts 02138","","","United States","1977-12-10T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: J.

Abnormally low resistivity data are alternatively interpreted to indicate the presence of high-temperature fluids or conductive minerals (metal sulfides) at depth, even though relative contributions of thermal, porosity, and fluid composition effects appear to be poorly known. An analysis of intrinsic rock resistivities, calculated electrical porosities, and two-dimensional heat and mass transfer computations indicates that the host rock resistivity distribution around igneous intrusives is directly related to the mode of dispersion of thermal energy away from the pluton. Comparisons between numerical results and field observations in geothermal areas indicate that resistivity values in the vicinity of thermal anomalies are a complex function of fluid circulation patterns, fluid composition, and the distribution of conductive minerals produced by the reaction between circulating fluids and rocks; therefore in many cases, low near-surface resistivity anomalies cannot be entirely accounted for by hot circulating saline fluids, and observations of high thermal gradients associated with low-resistivity anomalies are not unique indications of high-energy geothermal resource at shallow crustal depths.","","","Department of Geology and Geophysics, University of Minnesota, Minneapolis, Minnesota","","","United States","1977-12-10T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: J.

These consisted of a naturally occurring very fine grained sand and glass beads, each with a porosity of approximately 38 percent. Compressional- and shear-wave velocities and pore compressibility were measured in the brine- and gas-saturated specimens over a differential pressure range of 400 to 5000 psi. Measured velocities increase with increasing pressure very closely as a power of pressure. Pore compressibility of the glass bead specimen exceeds that of the Ottawa sand specimen by a factor of approximately 1.3 and, accordingly, static frame (bulk) compressibility of the glass bead specimen also is substantially greater. Shear modulus increases nonlinearly with differential pressure, the shear modulus of the Ottawa sand specimen becoming increasingly greater than that of the glass bead specimen with increasing pressure. Poisson's ratio is moderately greater for the Ottawa sand specimen. Compressional- and shear-wave velocities also were measured with a brine-gas mixture in the reservoir pore space at various brine saturations and at differential pressures of 1500 aiH 4500 psi. Measured shear-wave velocities generally decrease moderately with increasing brine saturation, substantially in conformance with theoretical curves. Effective fluid compressibilities, derived from compressional-wave velocity measurements, in general are between theoretical values given by the weighted-by-volume average of the compressibilities (direct weighting) and of the incompressibilities (inverse weighting) of the gas and brine.","","","Amoco Production Co., Tulsa, OK","","","United States","1977-12-01T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: Geophysics; (United States); Journal Volume: 42:7; Conference: 46. annual international SEG meeting, Houston, TX, USA, 27 Oct 1976","","Medium: X; Size: Pages: 1339-1368","","","","Journal ID: CODEN: GPYSA","10.1190/1.1440797","","2016-05-11T00:00:00Z","5615029","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/5615029","","Geophysics; (United States)","","42:7"

The standard molal volume of aqueous silica (V/sup 0/) decreases as a sigmoid function of temperature at constant pressure but increases as pressure increases at constant temperature. In contrast, the standard molal heat capacity (C/sup 0//sub p/) maximizes with increasing pressure at intermediate temperatures. C/sup 0//sub p/, which is negative at low temperatures, exhibits a maximum also as a function of temperature at constant pressure. Owing to the behavior of the partial derivatives of the dielectric constant of H/sub 2/O with respect to pressure and temperature, both V/sup 0/ and C/sup 0//sub p/ approach -infinity at the critical point of H/sub 2/O, but at low temperatures where V/sup 0/ is positive, C/sup 0//sub p/ is negative and decreases dramatically with decreasing temperature at constant pressure. The broad extrema exhibited by curves representing the solubility of ..cap alpha..-quartz as a function of temperature at pressures less than or equal to a kilobar are a consequence of these variations in V/sup 0/ and C/sup 0//sub p/. At high temperatures and low pressures, changes in the thermodynamic properties of aqueous silica are controlled primarily by the electrostatic properties of H/sub 2/O, but at low temperatures the local solvent structure dominates the temperature and pressure dependence of V/sup 0/ and C/sup 0//sub p/. The geologic consequences of the thermodynamic behavior of aqueous silica can be predicted by combining the theoretical equations and regression coefficients with thermodynamic data for minerals and other aqueous species, which permits calculation of the distribution of SiO/sub 2/ among silicates and H/sub 2/O-rich hydrothermal solutions at high pressures and temperatures.","","","Univ. of California, Berkeley","","","United States","1977-12-01T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: Am.

At 500 to 600/sup 0/ there is a tendency for formation of framework aluminosilicates (nepheline, kalsilite) at high Na and K concentrations in the initial mixtures, and nesosilicates (monticellite, forsterite) at high Ca and Mg concentrations. It is shown that as the residence time is increased synthetic and natural montmorillonites with Al/sup IV/ are not converted to ordered 1:1 mixed-layer phases, in contrast to those observed in systems with kaolinite. This is probably due to the statistically uniform distribution of Al in a structure of beidellite-type montmorillonites synthesized from feldspars, whereas beidellites with polar distribution of Al/sup IV/ over the (Si, Al-O) tetrahedral networks are apparently developed from kaolinite. When the albite structure is converted to the pyroxene structure, a considerable part of the tetrahedra is inherited by the latter; this follows from retention of the values of the chemical shift and quadrupole splitting typical of tetrahedral /sup 57/Fe(III). The experimental data can be used to reconstruct the primary mineral composition of metamorphic pararocks.","","","","","","United States","1977-12-01T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: Int.

The number of pores with a given size is assumed to be inversely proportional to the initial volume and independent of the separation between pores. The simple relationships relating the radius of a pore to the applied pressure are discussed. The pressure-volume relationship for the porous material with any saturation is calculated by using the input parameters, shear strength, shear modulus, matrix and fluid pressure-volume relationships, and the pressure-volume data for the dry material.

In order for the highly conducting melt to affect the bulk conductivity it must form interconnections, so that the very existence of mantle conductivity anomalies constitutes evidence for such interconnections. The inclusion of petrological data on the partial melting of peridotite strongly constrains the range of temperatures and melt fractions that can be used to yield an observed electrical conductivity. Thus from anomalous conductivities which are observed under rift zones, volcanic belts, geothermal areas, and beneath the oceans, it is possible to estimate both the temperature and the degree of partial melting. While other mechanisms for mantle conductivity enhancement may exist, e.g., contributions from contaminated grain boundaries or high volatile contents, these explanations associate a chemical differentiation in the mantle with thermal manifestations and in most cases create conditions that favor melting.","","","Geosciences Group, Los Alamos Scientific Laboratory, Los Alamos, New Mexico 87545","","","United States","1977-11-10T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: J.

Profile spacing was roughly 10 km, and heat flow stations were located at each track line intersection. South of the fracture zone the crust is young (0--1.8 m.y.), sediment cover is incomplete, and on average, heat flow is very low in comparison with that predicted by any reasonable model for lithosphere creation. Station to station heat flow variability is high and uncorrelated with local topography or structure, and the nature and magnitude of variability cannot be accounted for by the thermal effects of either heat flow refraction or rapid sedimentation. On the Explorer ridge flank, north of the fracture zone, the crust is older (3.3--6.6 m.y.) and fully sedimented. Large local variability in heat flow values still exists, but a relationship between heat flow and sediment thickness can be detected. On average, heat flow increases with decreasing sediment thickness, and although the variation is in the proper sense, the magnitude of the observed heat flow variation cannot be explained by simple conductive mechanisms, such as deposition of cold sediments. A similar relationship between heat flow and sediment thickness is observed for the sediment-filled axial valley on the Juan de Fuca ridge, and basement temperatures estimated there range between about 100/sup 0/ and 300/sup 0/C. On the Explorer ridge flank, open circulation is prevented by the thick and continuous sediment cover, and the heat flow average over the area (5.7 HFU, where 1 HFU=1..mu..cal cm /sup 2/s/sup -1/) should be a reliable estimate of the total conductive heat flux for this age crust (4.5 m.y. on average). This, with other reliable data points from the Pacific, supports a simple dependence of heat flow upon age of heat flow (HFU) =12.0/age/sup 1/2/ (m.y.).","","","Department of Earth and Planetary Sciences, Massachusetts Institute of Technology, Cambridge, Massachusetts 02139","","","United States","1977-10-10T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: J.

A series of heuristic models based on these equations describes the general features of fluid circulation near an igneous intrusive body within the upper 10 km of the crust. Analysis indicates that fluid circulation is an inevitable consequence of magma emplacement. The magnitude of this circulation generates convective heat fluxes which predominate over conductive fluxes when host rock permeabilities exceed 1.0 nm/sup 2/. However, cooling rates for the pluton are not significantly shortened unless the pluton permeability is also greater than 1.0 nm/sup 2/. The geometries of circulation and isotherms are directly affected by variations in pluton size, depth, and permeability as well as permeability distribution in the host rock. The effect of fluid properties on heat and mass transport is striking. The style of circulation is controlled by coincident maxima of the isobaric thermal coefficient of expansion and heat capacity with the viscosity minima in the supercritical region of the H/sub 2/O system. Waters in intrusive systems are predicted to move several km in a few hundred thousand years. Temperature and pressure changes along the flowpaths produce changes in solvent properties. The fluid-rock interactions should generate diagnostic mineral assemblages and isotopic changes. Average fluid:rock mass ratios of 0.4 are realized over the permeable portions of the systems. The extent of circulation, and magnitude of convective heat flux over broad crustal regions and along plate boundaries may be much greater than suspected.","","","","","","United States","1977-10-01T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: Am.

Experimental results show that P-total of fractured rock in hydrothermal systems ranges from 0.2 to 0.01, and P-diffusion ranges from 0.001 to 0.00001. Data from the literature and from field studies of fractures indicate that P-flow is 0.001-0.00001. Consequently, the greater part of P-total in plutonic environments results from residual pores which are not interconnected to P-flow or P-diffusion. Permeability is a function of the abundance and geometry of continuous flow paths. Observations suggest that a planar fracture is a good first order approximation for fractures in plutonic environments. Analysis of aperture, abundance, and continuity suggests that permeabilities on the order of 1.0 nm/sup 2/ may be characteristic of large portions of the crust. The model proposed permits definition of the interface between circulating hydrothermal fluids and reactant minerals in a manner consistent with the physical phenomena and partial differential equations which describe the processes of advection-diffusion-reaction.","","","","","","United States","1977-10-01T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: Am.

However, subsurface boiling (in high-temperature systems) and dilution may cause deuterium (and oxygen 18) contents of hot spring and recharge waters to differ significantly. By using thermodynamic and isotopic fractionation data for water and steam the differences in chloride, oxygen 18, and deuterium between surface and deep thermal waters have been calculated for 'single-stage' (in which steam remains mixed with water and separates near a single temperature) and 'continuous' (in which steam is separated as it is formed) steam separation. Although changes in chloride concentration resulting from these processes are nearly identical, isotopic changes differ greatly. Single-stage steam separation from 250/sup 0/ to 95/sup 0/C results in increases in Cl, 10/sup 3/ ln ..delta../sup 18/O, and 10/sup 3/ ln ..delta..D(..delta..=(10/sup 3/+delta/sub surf/)/ (10/sup 3/+delta/sub deep/))) of 1.44 times, 1.75 0/00, and 9.1 0/00, respectively, whereas continuous steam separation results in increases of 1.41 times, 1.05 0/00, and 3.1 0/00. Because of these effects, deuterium contents of hot springs may be substantially higher than those of recharging waters, and part of the observed oxygen isotope shift may be due to boiling. The diverse compositions observed could result from boiling with 'multiple-stage' (intermediate between single-stage and continuous) steam separation of mixtures of a single deep thermal water (360/sup 0/C, 310 ppm Cl, and -149 0/00 deltaD) with cold dilute (5/sup 0/C, 2 ppm Cl) meteoric waters differing in deuterium according to locality (Norris, -142 0/00; Lower, -144 0/00; and Shoshone, -133 0/00). The recharge to the deep thermal water must be precipitation remote from the geyser basins or ancient precipitation from a colder period.","","","U.S. Geological Survey, Menlo Park, California 94025","","","United States","1977-09-10T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: J.

Reflection data revealed a paleobasin beneath the main body of the lake containing up to 190 m of lake sediments deposited on intrusive or volcanic bedrock. Prominent reflectors are interpreted to correspond to glaciated layers, erosional surfaces developed during periods of desiccation, and sediments deposited during Recent lake impoundment by rhyolite flows. Volcanic units that outcrop at the south end of the lake are correlated with reflectors that plunge northward beneath the paleobasin, indicating at least 300 m of Recent subsidence of the Yellowstone caldera. Sedimentation rates of 10--13 cm/100 yr were deduced from paleomagnetic logs of shallow cores and suggest a maximum of 200,000 years of deposition within the paleobasin. Refraction data delineated a 1-km-deep, 5.0-km/s layer, interpreted as the top of a shallow crystalline intrusive or volcanic layer possibly associated with the Yellowstone caldera. A rapid decrease in the number of earthquakes occurring 4 km inside the geologically mapped caldera boundary corresponds to a zone of thermal gradients increasing from 200/sup 0/C/km to 800/sup 0/C/km and is interpreted to reflect the boundary of a deeper crustal structure, perhaps the edge of a cooling magma body.

Higher heat flow in West Thumb and Mary Bay (about 1600 mW m/sup -2/ (40 ..mu..cal cm/sup -2/ s/sup -1/)) outlines two thermal subprovinces within the caldera. The conductive heat loss beneath the lake is similar in magnitude to the average convective heat loss calculated from chloride budgets. Extrapolated temperatures beneath the lake reach the boiling point under pressure at approximately 500-m depth, and deeper temperatures probably increase along the boiling point curve in a laterally extensive geothermal reservoir to depths of the order of 800 +- 400 m. Thermal areas in the park probably result from structurally and topographically controlled convection systems in this surficial system. A deeper, hotter fluid circulation system in fractures in the solidified granite postulated to underly the caldera at shallow depths (about 1 km) may exist at depth.

Earthquakes located during detailed surveys from 1972 to 1976 occurred west and northeast of the Yellowstone caldera along east-west zones and south of the caldera in north-south zones. The change in trend suggests that Yellowstone is at a vertex of the contemporary tectonic patterns. Seismicity showed variations of maximum focal depths from approx.20 km outside the Yellowstone caldera to approx.5 km inside the caldera. The frequency of earthquake occurrence was markedly lower within the caldera. Fault plane solutions showed general north-south extension west of the caldera, a suggestion of radial compression near the western caldera rim, and northeast to southeast extension south of the caldera. Spectral analyses of aeromagnetic data indicate the Curie isotherm to be 10 +- 3 km below sea level at the periphery of the caldera.

The southeastern slope appears to trend onshore, where steep bare scarps facing the lake are exposed near the north and east sides of the bay. The steep slope surrounding the basin in the bay corresponds to a change in character of the magnetic field. Broad smooth anomalies are found over the basin, and narrow high-amplitude anomalies over the surrounding platform. The center of the basin is occupied by deep narrow thermal basins having extremely rough local topography, where very high values of heat flow and sediment temperatures were measured.

Corrosion rates for the turbine alloys are generally low and compare favorably with results obtained at Cerro Prieto and Wairakei. Compared with CrMoV, the Ni-containing steels, NiMoV and NiCrMoV, are not particularly susceptible to preferential corrosion along grain boundaries when exposed to separated steam. When tested as highly stressed U-bends, some of the 12Cr and Modified-12Cr martensitic stainless steels are susceptible to stress corrosion cracking, assumed to be caused by hydrogen sulfide; however, for materials of most interest there was no observed cracking at more meaningful stress levels. The occurrence of pitting in the martensitic stainless steels, particularly that caused by exposure to air in the absence of separated steam, causes a marked reduction in their fatigue endurance limits. Geothermal turbine shutdown procedures must be designed to avoid severe corrosion on exposure of the unit to air. The most commonly used 12Cr/Type 403 bucket alloy exhibited the smallest reduction in fatigue properties due to corrosion pitting. Separated steam at the New Mexico site was not particularly aggressive with respect to corrosion of the AgCuZnNi brazing alloy. Corrosion of the Cu-containing alloys is attributable to the presence of hydrogen sulfide as a contaminant in the separated steam. Alloys possessing the necessary corrosion resistance for heat exchanger applications are available. Corrosion product analyses confirm the important role of hydrogen sulfide and chloride in the corrosion and stress cracking behavior of the turbine alloys exposed to geothermal steam.","","","General Electric Co., Lynn, MA","","","United States","1977-09-01T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: Geotherm.

Convection is driven by a phase change instability mechanism. If steam and water are always in thermodynamic equilibrium, then temperature perturbations are directly responsible for pressure variations, which tend to move the fluid against the frictional resistance of the medium to flow. Mass conservation insures that any horizontal divergence of fluid is balanced by an appropriate vertical motion, while condensation and boiling occur to achieve a balance of forces in the vertical. Convection occurs more readily in a porous medium containing saturated liquid by the phase change instability than it would in a porous layer filled with ordinary water by the Rayleigh-Benard buoyancy-driven instability. Porous layers with steam-water mixtures are also more susceptible to convection than are those containing ordinary water. Phase-change-driven convection is concentrated toward the bottom of the porous layer; the cells are narrow in comparison to their depth.","","","Space Sciences Laboratory, Ivan A.

This conversion involves the convolution of the sampled values, uniformly spaced on a log distance scale, with a set of filter coefficients. For Schlumberger and dipole-dipole configurations, these coefficients can be calculated directly from the Schlumberger filter function. Oscillations of the filter coefficients at large indices (distances) can be minimized by proper selection of the sampling interval, as suggested by Koefoed. The choice of an optimal sampling interval has a more pronounced effect on the accuracy of the inverse transform (raised kernel function into apparent resistivity) than on that of the forward transform. The accuracy of the inverse transform can be improved for nonoptimal sampling intervals by ''phase perturbation'' of the filter function. Both transforms are sensitive to aliasing, which can be severe for certain dipole-dipole configurations.","","","Univ. of Texas at Dallas, Richardson","","","United States","1977-08-01T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: Geophysics; (United States); Journal Volume: 42:5","","Medium: X; Size: Pages: 1037-1044","","","","Journal ID: CODEN: GPYSA","10.1190/1.1440763","","2016-05-23T00:00:00Z","6544051","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/6544051","","Geophysics; (United States)","","42:5"

We propose that about half of the 350 km/sup 3/ of intracaldera Bishop tuff, or that part beneath the resurgent dome, has been subjected to extensive hydrothermal alteration. The heat that produced this alteration is apparently associated with the residual magma chamber, and much of the formation may still be hot (>200degreeC). The magnetic minerals in the remaining intracaldera Bishop tuff have not been drastically altered, presumably because the tuff was not heated sufficiently. As a result, the tuff may not be very hot today. The model also reveals the existence of parts of two large precaldera mountains beneath the caldera fill. The resolving power attained in this investigation was possible because we were dealing with large, magnetically distinct lithologic units and a large amount of geological and geophysical data were available constraints to produce the solution.","","","U.

In numerous geologic situations the sound speed of such two-phase systems may be of interest: in the search for magma reservoirs, in seismic exploration of geothermal areas, in prediction of P wave velocity decreases prior to earthquakes, and in inversion of crustal and upper mantle seismic records. Probably most dramatically, fluid flow characteristic during eruptions of volcanoes and geysers are strongly dependent on the sound speed of erupting two-phase (or multiphase) fluids. In this paper the sound speeds of water, air, steam, water-air mixtures, and water-steam mixtures are calculated. It is demonstrated that sound speeds calculated from classical acoustic and fluid dynamics analyses agree with results obtained from finite amplitude 'vaporization wave' theory. The sound speed of pure liquid water is a complex function of pressure and temperature and is given here to 8 kbar 900degree C.The sound speed of a water-air mixture depends on the pressure, the void or mass fraction of air, the frequency of the sound wave, and, if surface tension effects are included, on bubble radius. The sound speeds of the pure liquid and gas end-members are nearly independent of pressure, but the sound speed of a mixture is highly dependent on pressure. The sound speed in a single-component two-phase system, such as a water-steam mixture, depends on whether or not equilibrium between the phases on the saturation curve is maintained. Heat and mass transfer which occur when equilibrium is maintained cause the sound speed to be much lower than under nonequilibrium conditions in which heat and mass transfer are absent.","","","Department of Geology, University of California, Los Angeles, California 90024","","","United States","1977-07-10T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: J.

With a sufficient increase in temperature, effective pressure becomes equal to the tensile strength, and the rock fractures. The ratio of the coefficient of thermal expansion to the compressibility for the pore fluid defines the nature of this process. Finite element computations indicate that thermally induced hydraulic fracturing of host rocks is inevitable in hot pluton environments. A fracturing front propagates away from cooling plutons at a rate of 100 cm/yr for the first 400 years and at 1 cm/yr at 10/sup 5/ years. Fluid energy release upon fracturing can produce microearthquakes of measurable magnitude. Predicted frequencies of microearthquakes vary from 4 x 10/sup 3/ events/day at 5 x 10/sup 3/ years to 500 events/day at 10/sup 5/ years. Estimates of ambient pore fluid pressures and effective pressures show that effective pressure continually increase with depth for geothermal gradients less than 10degreeC/km. For larger geothermal gradients the effective pressure first increases but eventually decreases.","","","Department of Geosciences, University of Arizona, Tucson, Arizona 85721","","","United States","1977-06-10T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: J.

The high cost of direct sampling requires that earth-based observations be made first, followed by unmanned flights and landing missions. The surface composition of over 100 metal-rich asteroids has already been measured by reflectance spectroscopy. A determination of retrievability and obtainable economic and social benefits is needed before mining of extraterrestrial minerals is undertaken. The possible economic benefits of nickel-iron mining are developed, and ecological and political advantages of not mining low-grade ores on earth are emphasized. Although no legal framework exists for mining in space, the same arrangements could be used that were developed for the sea floor. Solar energy could be used for refining and processing materials during transport through space. All transport options are energy-intensive and must be able to accomplish two velocity changes in order to push the material out of the sun's orbit and into the earth's orbit. Safety requires that the re-entry mass be of lower density than water. Other problems will involve developing an acceptable life for space miners. 21 references.

The theoretical model considers a general three-dimensional field of flow in conjunction with a one-dimensional vertical deformation field. The governing equation expresses the conservation of fluid mass in an elemental volume that has a constant volume of solids. Deformation of the porous medium may be nonelastic. Permeability and the compressibility coefficients may be nonlinearly related to effective stress. Relationships between permeability and saturation with pore water pressure in the unsaturated zone may be characterized by hysteresis. The relation between pore pressure change and effective stress change may be a function of saturation. In the transition zone where pore water pressure is less than atmospheric but greater than air entry value, soil moisture diffusivity as used in soil physics and coefficient of consolidation as used in soil mechanics are shown to be conceptually equivalent. It is believed that this model will be of practical interest in studying saturated--unsaturated systems undergoing simultaneous desaturation and deformation.","","","Univ. of California, Berkeley","","","United States","1977-06-01T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: Water Resour.

Data on magmatic activity below the volcanic belt of East Kamchatka, obtained during geophysical investigations, mainly during detailed seismological investigations and deep seismic sounding, provide evidence for an association between the volcanoes and the processes in the Pacific Ocean focal layer of earthquakes, and for the accumulation of magmas below the volcanic belt at depths less than 60 km. Anomalous columnar bodies more than 5 to 7 km across were found linking the volcanoes with the focal layer. There was also a very large concentration of convective heat flow and volatiles in the magma columns feeding the volcanoes. As to the role of different forces in the uprise of magmas into the volcanoes, hydrostatic forces probably predominate in the asthenosphere, supplemented by tectonic pressure in the lithosphere and forces associated with boiling of magmas during release of volatiles in the crust, especially in its upper layers.","","","","","","United States","1977-06-01T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: Int.

Ultrabasic magmatic columns must rise from a local layer at depths of 100 to 250 km. Above it in the asthenosphere, a regular series of major magmatic columns develops with a spacing of about 30 km, which provides separate individual volcanic centers. The optimal radius of the columns is 350 to 1000 m and the velocity of their uprise is about 1 m/yr. Magma is moved in them by an order more rapidly than in the asthenoliths. Excess magmatic pressure in the columns contributes to the formation of accumulations of ultrabasic and basic magmas near the base, the crust and the transitional layer between the crust and the mantle, and also to the development of peripheral andesitic magmatic foci on the boundary between the crystalline basement and the sediments. A probable scheme for deep-seated magmatic activity below the volcanic belt of Eastern Kamchatka, the island arcs and similar structures is presented.","","","","","","United States","1977-06-01T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: Int.

The down-well pump eliminates the use of a surface pump and possibly a shaft, thus doing away with problems of rotation and torque, and additional labor time and equipment. Another advantage is near-elimination of corrosion due to flashing.

Recently published radiometric ages allow comparison of rates of basaltic magmatism in these ensialic provinces with those along equivalent lengths of mid-oceanic ridge. The rates of total magmatic activity (extrusive and intrusive) during the genesis of the Columbia River Plateau, Western Snake River Plain and Eastern Snake River Plain--Yellowstone sub-provinces were equivalent to those of mid-oceanic ridges with spreading half-rates of 10, 3 and 0.3 cm per year, respectively. It is shown that the hypothesis that magmatism in this region is the product of a deep-mantle convective plume, situated at present beneath Yellowstone, does not explain adequately several features of the Snake River Plain and becomes untenable when applied to the province as a whole. It is proposed instead that all major post-Eocene tectonic and magmatic features of the western U.S.A., east of the Sierra Nevada and Cascades, are products of comparatively shallow-rooted diapiric upwelling in the mantle; triggered at about 40 m.y. by extraction of mafic silicate melt and volatiles from the Farallon lithospheric plate, subducted at a comparatively low angle beneath the North American plate. Constriction of the Columbia River Plateau diapir by the subduction zone to its west led to ''run away'' mantle fusion and massive production of basic magmas.","","","Imperial Coll. of Science and Technology, London","","","United States","1977-05-11T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: Tectonophysics; (United States); Journal Volume: 39:4","","Medium: X; Size: Pages: 621-636","","","","Journal ID: CODEN: TCTOA","10.1016/0040-1951(77)90157-3","","2016-05-26T00:00:00Z","6781051","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/6781051","","Tectonophysics; (United States)","","39:4"

Mineralogical data, density, and porosity are also given for each rock. Velocity hysteresis was found to vary systematically with experimental temperature and pressure conditions. This result is tentatively explained on the basis of crack behavior in the rocks. Velocity was found to depend strongly on bulk density and weakly on mineralogy. Samples of shale and melange matrix have velocities similar to sandstone of comparable density. Results suggest that structural and lithologic complexities in clastic rocks of uniform metamorphic grade will not lead to complex velocity structure. Velocities in rocks of common density are consistent with velocity profiles measured in the upper crust in central California.

As only a small quantity of the fluid is flashed to steam the development of devices which can effectively utilize the two-phase product is desirable. A device patented in 1975 combines aspects of centrifugal separators and turbines. Brine is expanded through nozzles tangential to the rotating components and partially flashed to steam which accelerates the remaining liquid. At the nozzle exit the fluid enters a rotating separator drum where it separates into a liquid ring and vapor core. This is accomplished with minimal friction losses. Finally the liquid is fed through a radial inflow turbine and the vapor is ducted to a heat exchanger. The condensor output is potable and may be used for municipal supply or irrigation. Biphase Engines Inc. has built a test unit which is truck mounted for field testing. It is expected that the system is capable of producing 1.1 MW and 866,250 liters/day of fresh water, given a wellhead pressure of 1.5 MN/cm/sup 2/ (225 psi).","","","","","","United States","1977-05-02T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: Des.

Thermal models were developed that predict a lithospheric thickness of a few tens of kilometers in young oceans and continental orogenic provinces and more than 300 km in shield areas. The variable thermal structue of the mantle implies a greater viscosity beneath shields, which offers an explanation for the observed retarded motions of plates that bear shields.","","","","","","United States","1977-05-01T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: Geology; (United States); Journal Volume: 5:5","","Medium: X; Size: Pages: 265-268","","","","Journal ID: CODEN: GLGYB","10.1130/0091-7613(1977)5<265:RGALT>2.0.CO;2","","2016-04-21T00:00:00Z","5140081","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/5140081","","Geology; (United States)","","5:5"

Hence steam enters the turbine at 65 psia (4.48 bar) and at a pass-in point at 15 psia (1.03 bar). For the above conditions, curves of power potential and thermal efficiency are drawn for geothermal fluid of various enthalpies up to that of dry steam, for three different values of turbine outlet pressure (within the condenser) which covers the range most likely to be met. For comparison purposes, curves are also shown for the case where the fluid is separated in one-stage at the higher pressure given above, with elimination of the supplementaty steam entering the turbine at the lower, pass-in pressure. The spread of enthalpies studied was from 300 to 1200 Btu/lb (700 to 2800 j/g) which gave a range of thermal efficiencies from 0.014 to 0.16.","","","","","","United States","1977-04-01T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: Geotherm.

The concept is to drill a hole into the hot, relatively impermeable rock and create a large hydraulic fracture that serves as a downhole heat exchanger. A second hole is drilled to intersect the fracture, creating a circulation loop for the injected water. Two deep holes (GT-2 and EE-1) were drilled at the Fenton Hill site in northern New Mexico. The first hole, GT-2, has a depth of 2,928 m and a bottom-hole temperature of 197/sup 0/C. The second hole, EE-1, was temporarily halted at a depth of 3,062 m, where the temperature is 205.5/sup 0/C.

The distribution of water temperatures in the FAMOUS area was investigated during the years 1972 to 1974. Forty-seven vertical temperature profiles were taken and bottom-water temperature measurements along 110 km of traverses were carried out during the course of four cruises. Potential temperatures in the FAMOUS area were found to range between 3.53 and 3.85/sup 0/C below a depth of 2,200 m. These temperatures are almost 1/sup 0/C higher than temperatures outside the axial zone of the Mid-Atlantic Ridge at comparable depths. The potential temperature in deep waters was observed to increase from 3.53/sup 0/C in the western part of fracture zone B to 3.80/sup 0/C in the eastern part of fracture zone A. Vertical temperature gradients are smaller than 1 x 10/sup -4/ /sup 0/C/m at depths below 2,200 m in the various basins of the FAMOUS area. Between 2,000 and 1,800 m, the temperature differences between the different parts of the area gradually disappear; above 1,500 m, there are no significant differences between water temperatures in the ridge and those in the surrounding ocean. The observed near-bottom temperature distribution in the FAMOUS area is related to the bottom topography. The temperatures in the various basins are determined mainly by their sill depth; the observed south-north increase of deep-water temperatures and the velocity of bottom-water currents in the area can be related quantitatively to hydrologic effects. The influence of hydrothermal activity and of heat flow through the ocean floor on the temperature distribution in the area is negligible.","","","","","","United States","1977-04-01T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: Geol.

Anthophyllite has a relatively narrow temperature stability range at 1 kb, but it increases as P/sub H/sub 2/O/ increases.

The (Q) and (Fo) invariant points are at approximately 603/sup 0/C, 500 bars, and 601/sup 0/C, 175 bars, P/sub H/sub 2/O/, respectively. Higher P/sub total/ raises and spreads the P/sub H/sub 2/O/ values of the invariant points. The log SiO/sub 2/ /sub aq/ versus 1/T diagrams utilized in this study are applied to metasomatic and isochemical processes involving this system. Aspects of contact metamorphism and metasomatism, the process of serpentinization, and compositional controls and relative stabilities of the serpentine phases are discussed. Isochemical cooling in the subsolidus at finite, though not necessarily constant, P/sub H/sub 2/O/ results in a mineral reaction series analogous to that of the classical reaction series of silicate melts. The chemical constraints revealed in the various equilibria studied help to clarify and more rigorously to define the isochemical PT relationships of the system. The geological application of activity-activity or chemical potential diagrams is also discussed, and the necessity of considering reactions that correspond to or approximate the true process involved is illustrated.","","","","","","United States","1977-04-01T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: Am.

Analyses were made of forty-three samples from twenty-seven wells, two coastal springs, local precipitation, and steam. Three methods of chemical geothermometry were applied: (1) silica, (2) Na--K--Ca, and (3) stable isotope or deuterium-oxygen-18. Based on the silica and stable isotope methods, the most promising geothermal areas are the summit of Kilauea Volcano and the area near geothermal test hole 3 in the Puna district (east rift zone of Kilauea Volcano). There, temperatures calculated from dissolved silica range from about 160 to 275/sup 0/C. Mixing with cooler groundwaters appears to be a significant feature of these geothermal reservoirs. Seawater intrusion, possibly due to thermal disruption of the equilibrium of the Ghyben-Herzberg lens in geothermal areas, tends to interfere with the geothermometry of the Na--K--Ca and stable isotope methods.","","","","","","United States","1977-04-01T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: Am.

A suite of 101 well-navigated heat-flow stations was used to investigate lithospheric cooling on the Mid-Atlantic Ridge near 37/sup 0/N. Measurements in two topographic depressions marking the intersection of transform faults with axes of sea-floor spreading show evidence of hydrothermal circulation in basement rocks. One of these depressions appears to have been subjected to a recent bottom-water temperature change which severely biases the heat-flow data. Some of the evidence suggests that transform faults are more permeable than other regions of the ocean crust and therefore may cool much faster. The heat flow in rift mountains extending from 10 to 35 km west of the spreading axis was also measured. The data here also suggest that a hydrothermal system is presently active in the crustal rocks. Although hydrothermal vents have not yet been unambiguously identified on the sea floor, hydrothermal circulation seems likely to be the dominant mode of cooling oceanic crust near spreading axes where sediment cover is thin (that is, few tens of metres) or nonexistent.","","","","","","United States","1977-04-01T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: Geol.

Two numerical methods based on nonlinear least-squares curve fitting are derived to remove the effect of annual temperature wave at the ground surface. One method can provide information on the gradient and diffusivity as a function of depth while the other gives average value over the depth interval measured. Experiments were carried in six test holes cased with 2 cm OD PVC pipes in the Salton Sea geothermal field. A set of 5 to 7 thermistors was permanently buried inside the individual pipes with dry sand. Consistent gradient determinations were obtained with both numerical methods from six monthly observations. By linearly extrapolating the depths to the 100/sup 0/C and 200/sup 0/C isotherms from the calculated gradients and mean ground temperatures, good agreement was found with the nearby deep-well data for four holes. Discrepancy is found for two holes, one of which is located near the field of CO/sub 2/ mud volcanoes and the other near the volcanic Red Hill, reflecting complicated local hydrologic conditions.","","","Univ. of California, Riverside","","","United States","1977-04-01T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: Geophysics; (United States); Journal Volume: 42:3","","Medium: X; Size: Pages: 572-583","","","","Journal ID: CODEN: GPYSA","10.1190/1.1440728","","2016-05-02T00:00:00Z","6789231","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/6789231","","Geophysics; (United States)","","42:3"

Technical problems of pipe and valve corrosion and capital costs are being studied by ERDA and the Electric Power Research Institute (EPRI). Demonstrations of hydrothermal power indicate that there is a potential for supplementary power and the higher production costs can be readily absorbed in utility rates. Estimates range from 11 to 100 mills per kilowatt hour (20 mills is equivalent to $12 per-barrel of oil). Although other countries have generated electricity from geothermal sources since 1904 and some U.S. cities use it for space heating, industrial use is new. Plants expect to use it to generate power, dry timber, extract sulfur, etc., as is already done in some countries. ERDA projects are exploring 18 possible industrial applications, including sugar-refining operations and chemical processing. While resource estimates are great (44,000 quads), ERDA estimates only 100 quads are recoverable. Other research is aimed at circulating liquid through fractured hot, dry rock formations, which contain about half the country's geothermal energy.

These data are used to infer the dynamic stress--strain response. Both the character of the wave propagation and a comparison with quasi-static uniaxial strain data obtained by other workers suggest substantial strain rate dependence in this rock. The dynamic yield stress of 2.5 GPa determined from the wave propagation data was approximately a factor of 10 higher than that observed in the quasi-static data. Wave propagation below 2.5 GPa is suggestive of viscoelastic response, and a nonlinear Maxwell constitutive equation fitted to these data provides a characteristic relaxation time of 0.01 ..mu..s. Comparison of dynamic and quasi-static loading data suggests that the large difference in observed yield stress could be the result of a transition from failure by brittle fracture to failure by intracrystalline plastic flow.","","","","","","United States","1977-03-10T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: J.

The area studied is the immediate landward extension of the Mid-Atlantic Ridge, and seismic processes are probably similar to those on submarine parts of the ridge crest. The Reykjanes Peninsula forms the transition between the Reykjanes Ridge and the south Iceland transform fault. The peninsula is essentially a leaky transform fault, and focal mechanism solutions are of both normal and strike-slip types. The 12-km-long seismic zone active during the 8-day swarm is defined by 2514 hypocenters, which are mostly between 2 and 5 km deep. Individual structures within the seismic zone include several seismic lineations or faults trending obliquely to the zone. Also visible are two aseismic zones, which may be either rigid blocks or low-rigidity regions, such as magma chambers. Thus the observed seismic zone is not a single fault; instead it appears to be the shallow expression of a deeper-seated and aseismic deformation zone. In time, the seismic events cluster together into subswarms lasting a few hours and migrate laterally at speeds of 1 to 2 km/d. The energy released is equivalent to that of a single event of Icelandic local magnitude 4.9, and the total fault area is close to that expected for a single earthquake of this size. Although the high microearthquake activity and swarm seismicity can be generally related to the presence of an adjacent geothermal area, the observed earthquakes do not locate in or outline the hydrothermal upwelling zone visible at the surface. This contribution is the first study to reveal the details of faulting during an ocean ridge earthquake swarm, both in space and in time.","","","Lamont-Doherty Geological Observatory, Palisades, NY","","","United States","1977-02-10T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: J.

The International Atomic Energy Agency in responding (Act II) states that a feasibility study of geothermal energy is justified, but that the U.S. Geological Survey reports ''that the problems of recovering heat from molten igneous systems (magma) are so formidable that this energy cannot be recovered at the present time or even in the foreseeable future.'' Dr. Barnea in his rebuttal, Act III, offers that the Survey's report on geothermal resources is narrow and conservative, but that they have concluded that identified high-temperature convection systems and the evaluated onshore parts of the Gulf coast geopressured system are estimated to have a production potential of about 140,000 MW for 30 years of recoverable electricity, equivalent to 140 Hoover Dams or 140 average modern nuclear power plants. In Act IV, Geothermal vs Nuclear Debate Erupts, B. Bernhuker from the IAEA, differentiates between the various types of geothermal energy sources, confirms that geothermal power plants are economical, but ''unlike nuclear powers are not generally available'' to all nations. The final Act, by Lee Hickling, reports a somber atomosphere at the meeting of European and U.S. leaders from the nuclear power industry because of growing uncertainty by the participants regarding nuclear proliferation.

He researched the resource flows of geothermal steam electric, nuclear fission (LWR), coal-fired electric (mine mouth), geothermal hot water heating (Reykjavik, Iceland), and solar home heating in order to make the comparison. In a hot water geothermal system in which either flashing is used as at Cerro Prieto, or a ''binary'' system as the studies in the Imperial Valley indicate are most suitable for that area, the net efficiency does not change much when compared to the dry steam system. In effect, the greater pumping and equipment requirements of the hot water systems would be at least partially offset by the lower exploration and pipeline costs. A fact that should also be considered is that the environmental cost per unit of energy from geothermal energy production systems is also an order of magnitude less than from nuclear and fossil-fuel plants because of the geothermal system much-reduced support requirements.

"Volcanic hazards: extent and severity of potential tephra hazard interpreted from layer Yn from Mount St. Helens, Washington (Abstract)","Mullineaux, D R","15 GEOTHERMAL ENERGY; VOLCANOES; ERUPTION; HAZARDS; WASHINGTON; VOLCANISM; GEOLOGICAL SURVEYS; LAVA; LAYERS; PUMICE; IGNEOUS ROCKS; NORTH AMERICA; ROCKS; USA; VOLCANIC ROCKS; 150600* - Geothermal Energy- Environmental Aspects","Volcanoes in the conterminous United States erupt infrequently but represent a significant potential hazard. Tephra eruptions can affect broader areas and reach population centers at greater distances from a volcano than any other kind of volcanic event. Lava flows, pyroclastic flows, mudflows, and floods can be more hazardous, but they seldom extend beyond a volcano except along valleys. Severity of risk from tephra depends in part on rate of fall and grain size, but mainly on thickness. Rates of fall from future eruptions in the Cascade Range must be estimated from historic eruptions elsewhere; potential grain sizes and thicknesses can be judged from past tephra eruptions of the Cascade volcanoes themselves. Pumice layer Yn, erupted by Mount St. Helens about BC 2000, exemplifies an extensive and thick tephra resulting from a single eruptive pulse of a Cascade volcano; in thickness and volume it resembles tephra of the type Plinian eruption of Vesuvius in Italy in 79 AD. Layer Yn trends NNE from Mount St. Helens in a long narrow lobe that is much thicker at any given distance than if the layer had formed a wide lobe. On broad ridges where it should be nearly unaffected by thickening or erosion, its present (compacted) thickness is as much as 70 cm at about 50 km from the volcano, 20 cm at 100 km, and 5 cm at about 280 km. Future eruptions like that of layer Yn could produce similar thicknesses in any easterly direction between about NNE and SSE downwind from Mount St. Helens or any other explosive Cascade volcano. Weaker winds toward the west indicate that potential thicknesses are less in westerly directions.","","","US Geological Survey, Denver","","","United States","1977-02-01T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: Geol.

Unlike Israel, both France and Britain have advanced commercial nuclear power technology, while Israel has an abundance of solar radiation not shared by parts of France and most of the United Kingdom. In essence then, Israel is stressing the use of solar energy to heat water for consumption in the home, for space heating and cooling, and for solar ponds--the ponds are an original scheme for generating process heat and electricity. France, with the world's most advanced solar furnace, is involved in solar-thermal power development as well as in research to reduce the cost of photovoltaic conversion, and also has geothermal heating systems in operation and under construction.

Explosions from an active quarry on the opposite side of Mt. Baker were recorded at some two dozen locations, for the purpose of studying in detail paths through the mountain. Delays of up to 0.10 sec +- 0.05 sec were observed for rays passing within a few km of the mountain's center. These explosions as well as our own blasts are used to define the contact between the Mt.

Hypothetically, plate convergence during Late Jurassic to mid-Tertiary time produced a west-stepping subduction zone that thrust successively younger plates of sediments and volcanic rocks of the Franciscan assemblage eastward beneath oceanic crust and depositionally overlying sediments of the Great Valley sequence. East of this subduction zone, elements of previously subducted Franciscan plates were uplifted and faulted into the basal part of the ophiolite in response to regional compression. Some of the faults bounding the uplifted wedges died out upward into northwest-trending folds in the overlying ophiolite sheet, and others formed imbricate thrusts along which wedges of Franciscan rocks pierced the ophiolite. Many of these thrusts were later reactivated as strike-slip faults as motion between the Pacific and North American plates changed. Postulated rates of right-lateral motion between the Pacific and North American plates for the past 5 to 6 million years indicate that subduction and associated processes leading to partial melting deep in the subduction zone terminated in the Clear Lake region about 3 million years ago, with passage of the Mendocino triple junction. Following local termination of subduction, about 0.5 million years elapsed before eruption of the first Clear Lake volcanic rocks, during which time magma moved upward to mid-crustal levels, and extensional and strike-slipfaulting established conduits for venting of magma. This tectonic model implies that any significant new sources of geothermal energy in the Coast Ranges are most likely to be found north and northwest of the Clear Lake region, where subduction has recently been or is now active.","","","US Geological Survey, Menlo Park, CA","","","United States","1977-02-01T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: Geol.

However, direct heat utilization of geothermal energy may eventually become more significant than electricity generation from geothermal resources. Since the temperatures of most identified California hydrothermal systems are too low for electricity generation, yet adequate for process heat, most systems in California would be best used for direct heat applications, such as space and water heating, industrial processing, refrigeration, and agribusiness. Particularly favorable locations for direct heat applications include the Imperial Valley, Susanville, Mammoth, Lake County and Calistoga. Feasibility studies are currently underway in some of these localities to assess the practicality of direct heat applications, and to verify their potential significance. It is possible to combine uses in a cascading system, whereby the warm water output of one process is the input to the next process. Since many geothermal resources are located in remote, scenic areas, careful planning and mitigation of adverse impacts is essential. Direct heat utilization has less of a potential for damaging the environment than electricity generation facilities, since there is less attendant construction necessary, and the produced fluids can be kept entirely in a closed system with no release of gases or waters to the environment.","","","California Energy Resources Conservation and Development Commission, Sacramento","","","United States","1977-02-01T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: Geol.

The study was begun with a layered medium of classic seismology, but each layer was divided into many blocks and a parameter assigned to each block, which describes the velocity fluctuation from the average for the layer. Data are the teleseismic P travel time residuals observed at an array of seismographs distributed on the surface above the earth's volume we are modeling. By isolating various sources of errors and biases a system of equations was developed to determine the model parameters. The solution was obtained by the use of generalized inverse and stochastic inverse methods. The method also gives a lower limit of the true rms slowness fluctuation in the earth under the assumption of ray theory. Using P wave residual data from the Norwegian Seismic Array (Norsar), the map of velocity anomalies at various depths up to a depth of 126 km was obtained. The rms slowness fluctuation was found to be at least 3.1%. This is in agreement with estimates obtained from statistical analysis of P time fluctuations based on the Chernov theory. The three-dimensional velocity anomalies are presented both by the generalized inverse and by the stochastic inverse solutions. The dominant features in the obtained three-dimensional velocity image of the lithosphere beneath the Norsar array are low velocities to the west and high velocities to the east.The latter feature may be attributed to rocks of the Baltic shield which are undisturbed by the Caledonian orogeny or by Permian volcanism. Results conclusively demonstrate the existence of strong small-scale inhomogeneities to the bottom of the lithosphere. More theoretical and experimental works are needed to relate these velocity anomalies with the magma ascent mechanism which caused the Oslo graben.","","","","","","United States","1977-01-10T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: J.

Complete account is taken of the variable thermodynamic and transport properties of water as well as of non-Boussinesq effects. The increase of thermal expansivity with temperature by as much as a factor of 70 and the decrease of viscosity by more than 1 order of magnitude are primarily responsible for the enhanced instability to convection of a water-saturated porous layer compared with a porous layer saturated with a Boussinesq fluid having the constant properties of surface water. The critical Rayleigh number, critical wave number, and streamline and isotherm patterns are determined at the onset of convection of temperature gradients of 25, 50, 75, 100, 150, and 200 K/km in layers as thick as 10 km. The critical surface Rayleigh number is reduced by as much as a factor of 31 below the value of 4..pi../sup 2/ appropriate for a constant property Boussinesq fluid. Variable water properties thus allow convection to occur for smaller vertical temperature differences in rock of a given permeability or for smaller permeability at a given temperature difference. The horizontal scale of convection is somewhat reduced, and the flow is concentrated toward the bottom of the porous layer by effects of variable expansivity and viscosity.","","","Aerospace Corp., Los Angeles","","","United States","1977-01-10T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: J.

Additional data, mainly from test drilling, would be required for construction of a similar model of the deep hydrothermal system.","","","","","","United States","1977-01-01T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: J.

Isobaric solubilities are maximum near 100/sup 0/C in H/sub 2/O solutions; the maxima migrate to progressively higher temperatures in solutions of increasing NaCl concentrations. Isothermal solubilities increase with rising NaCl concentration and pressure. The effect of NaCl on increasing solubilities becomes greater with rising temperature. Changing temperatures cause different responses, depending on the composition of the solution and the temperature range. Initially-saturated dilute natural waters would precipitate barite with either increasing temperature or decreasing temperature, depending on the circumstances. Saline solutions are capable of behaving much like dilute solutions below 1 molal NaCl, but at higher NaCl concentrations the temperature effect on isobaric solubilities is monotonically positive. Barite solubility in sufficiently saline solutions in nature would increase with depth, due to increasing temperature and pressure. Precipitation would tend to occur during migration of solutions toward the surface. Because the low solubility of barite precludes effective transport of BaSO/sub 4/ in large quantities, precipitation of barite by the reaction of Ba/sup 2 +/ with sulfate derived from the oxidation of S/sup 2 -/ may be more important as a depositional mechanism than changes in the temperature-pressure environment. Thermodynamic equilibrium constants (K) and the free-energy changes for the reaction (..delta..G) for the dissolution of barite were calculated from the solubility data. Enthalpies, entropies, and volumes of reaction obtained from the solubility data are in accord with published data. Activity coefficients calculated using barite solubilities in NaCl solutions and log K data are accurately modeled by an extended form of the Debye-Hueckel equation.","","","Idaho State Univ., Pocatello","","","United States","1977-01-01T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: Am.

In the vertical zones, mixed-layer chlorite-vermiculite occurs more commonly than chlorite, whereas in the horizontal zones, mixed-layer chlorite-montmorillonite and chlorite are both more common. The occurrence of the two clay minerals kaolinite and mixed-layer chlorite-montmorillonite in the soil is not related to the parent rock but to differences in drainage. The zeolites are calcium zeolites which commonly coexist with quartz; laumontite is the dominant zeolite in the study area.

The experiments were carried out in an Inconel X bomb at temperatures from 180 to 382/sup 0/C and pressures from 200 to 1379 bars. Periodically, small amounts of solution were withdrawn from the bottom of the bomb through a stainless steel filter into high-pressure stainless steel capillary sampling line, quenched in an ice bath, and immediately diluted with previously weighed silica-free water. The diluted samples were analyzed for colorimetrically-reactive and total silica. The silica gel gave the same colorimetric silica as the vitreous silica. The solubility of amorphous silica at the vapor pressure of the solution, from 0 to 250/sup 0/C, is given by the equation log C = -731/T + 4.52, where C is the silica concentration in mg/kg and T is absolute temperature.

At this location steam occurs above the water table and the unconfined water is at the boiling temperature at depths of only a few meters; also temperatures and heat flows are far above background values.

In 1975 an interdisciplinary program of seismic, tilt, gravity, gas, hydrologic, petrologic, thermal infrared, and photographic studies by Federal and university scientists was initiated to evaluate the impact of the current thermal activity and to monitor changes that might indicate an impending eruption. By March 1976 only one small earthquake had been identified beneath Mount Baker. Tilt and gravity changes have been observed but cannot be attributed solely to volcanic causes. The data available thus far provide no evidence of an impending eruption, but they cannot be fully interpreted without many additional geophysical and geochemical measurements, as it is not yet possible to clearly distinguish volcanic effects from nonvolcanic background effects. Inasmuch as current activity continues unchanged--without steam explosions, eruptions, or frequent or large earthquakes--the probability of a suitable trigger for large avalanches and mudflows should decrease and should approach that of a more average year. Such an average year would have a hazard probability at least as great as that which existed before 1975, although that level of hazard was not recognized at the time by the public or by administrative agencies.","","","","","","United States","1977-01-01T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: U.S., Geol.

Ward, Utah Univ. geophysicist and noted pioneer in the research on locating geothermal energy sources. Two industrial firms have drilled several wells in the promising geothermal field of Roosevelt Hot Springs, near Milford, and found that more than a million pounds per hour of geothermal fluid, 25% of it as steam, can be discharged from the most productive wells.

Growing demands for electricity will require increased use of coal, our most abundant energy source. Research to improve plant performance, increase environmental control, and make end uses of electricity more efficient are needed. An EPRI analysis of ten options for coal concluded that direct-fired, low-sulfur coal offers the lowest busbar cost, followed by direct-fired high-sulfur coal. Combined-cycle systems promise to be competitive after 1985. EPRI's efforts have included work on controlling finer particulates, improving fabric filters, scrubbers for sulfur oxides, assessment of sludge regeneration, and control of nitrogen oxides. Other studies are under way to find better ways of using water, cleaning coal, demonstrating conversion alternatives such as fluidized-bed power plants, design and engineering problems of power plants, and different forms and uses of coal. Solar demonstration projects, geothermal and fusion research, energy storage, and conservation strategies are all part of EPRI's commitment to the utilities.

Development of geothermal resources at Sierra Prieto, Mexico, is under way and expansion of the power-generating facilities is now in progress. Environment, legal, and institutional problems have slowed, and probably will continue to slow, development in all areas in California in the near future.

Detailed field mapping in the Mecca Hills shows that the fault zone is delineated by two northeast-striking high-angle faults which subdivide pre-Cenozoic crystalline and schistose basement and overlying late Cenozoic and Quaternary nonmarine sedimentary rocks into three structural domains: (1) a high-standing, relatively undeformed block northeast of the fault zone; (2) a 1.5 km-wide zone of folded sedimentary rocks between the two faults; and (3) a sparsely exposed, deeply down-faulted block on the southwest. Locally the two faults branch upward and flatten abruptly outward into low-angle thrusts which carry thrust slices and gravity slides of sedimentary rocks from the central block short distances on to the adjacent blocks. Between the two faults the sedimentary succession is folded into broad west-northwest-trending open folds which tighten and are overturned and truncated against the faults. Where exposed in the fault zone the basement-sedimentary rock contact is a buttress unconformity which also is folded and overturned locally. Field observations reveal that the basement in the core of the fold is fractured and sheared pervasively, indicating that the mechanism of basement deformation was one of cataclastic flow by piecemeal slip on the closely spaced fracture and shear planes, whereas the folding of the overlying sedimentary rocks was largely a passive consequence of deformation at the basement level. Although horizontal shear strain predominated, local vertical uplift of the basement occurred as a result of compression between two convergently and laterally slipping rigid crustal blocks.","","","","","","United States","1976-12-01T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: Am.

Inverse interpretation of these data illustrates that vertical electric sounding with the Schlumberger array is superior, for this environment, to electromagnetic sounding with either a vertical magnetic dipole or a horizontal magnetic dipole. Combined parametric and geometric electromagnetic sounding using 84 data points is inferior to Schlumberger sounding using 21 data points. However, superiority in these contexts pertains to parameter resolution. The earth models obtained with all three soundings are virtually identical within the limits of resolution. The importance of percent parameter standard deviations, parameter correlations, and least-squares residuals are all illustrated for a field example in this manuscript. Reparameterization in terms of the Dar Zarrouk parameters S and T reduces the parameter correlations as expected. A generalization of reparameterization beyond the Dar Zarrouk parameters is suggested.","","","Univ. of Utah, Salt Lake City","","","United States","1976-12-01T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: Geophysics; (United States); Journal Volume: 41:6A","","Medium: X; Size: Pages: 1222-1235","","","","Journal ID: CODEN: GPYSA","10.1190/1.2035914","","2016-05-24T00:00:00Z","5026949","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/5026949","","Geophysics; (United States)","","41:6A"

Topological analysis is used to deduce the possible arrangements of univariant curves and invariant points. A choice among the possible arrangements was made using a simple criterion for orientation based on the signs and relative magnitudes of the entropies and volumes of univariant reactions. Experimental data and one assumption regarding some petrographic information were used to locate the univariant and invariant equilibria in pressure-temperature space. The resulting phase diagram suggests that a field for the stable coexistence of pyrophyllite and corundum does not exist. Most natural occurrences of diaspore + quartz probably represent disequilibrium, but a stability field for this assemblage may exist at high pressure. A field for the stable coexistence of pyrophyllite, diaspore, and water might be restricted to pressures where kyanite is stable. It is suggested that pyrophyllite may be stable during the diagenesis or very low-grade metamorphism of sediments. It is concluded that the proposed phase diagram represents a viable working model for some equilibria in this system.","","","Univ. of Oklahoma, Norman","","","United States","1976-12-01T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: Am.

Now, the U.S. is moving toward similar applications. A prime attraction is that low-grade heat from geothermal resources is widely available in the U.S., particularly in the western states. Despite the greater attention now afforded to using geothermal resources for electricity generation, which requires temperatures starting at about 150/sup 0/C, lower temperature geothermal resources are about equally abundant. Second, nonelectric use of low-temperature resources boasts greater utilization efficiency than electricity generation from higher temperature geothermal resources. A third attraction for nonelectric tasks is fewer technical complications and risks in actually using the geothermal energy. Fourth, a typical nonelectric geothermal system is much smaller and thus far less expensive to build than a power plant. However, there is one prominent cloud on the nonelectric horizon. The use installation must be situated quite near the geothermal resource, since heat cannot be shipped very far.","","","","","","United States","1976-11-08T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: Chem.

By combining the osmotic coefficients (phi = -(55.51/2m) ln a/sub 1/, where m is the molality and a/sub 1/ is the activity of water) determined from the freezing point measurements of Doherty and Kester (1974), with the heat capacity data of Millero, Perron, and Desnoyers (1973), and the enthalpy data of Millero, Hansen, and Hoff (1973), the osmotic coefficients were determined over the range of 0/sup 0/ to 40/sup 0/C at 1 atm using the extended Debye-Heuckel equation. The results at 25/sup 0/C were found to be in excellent agreement with the results of Robinson (1954). From the osmotic coefficient data, the vapor pressure and osmotic pressure have been determined. The osmotic coefficient data at 0/sup 0/C has been used to calculate the mean activity coefficient and activity of ''sea salt.'' By using the thermodynamic equation delta lna/sub 2//delta T + - anti L/sub 2//RT, activities have been determined at other temperatures (0/sup 0/ to 40/sup 0/C).

The effects of various terms in the basic equations are also studied. The solution of some typical examples is given, and the significant effect of the stress intensity factor of the rock on the crack propagation is shown.

Detection at the receiver site was accomplished by measuring the vertical induction component with an ungrounded loop.

Twenty-nine thermal conductivity determinations on eight cores give a mean conductivity of 1.82 meal/cm s degreeC (0.75 W/m degreeK). Curvature in the upper 50 m of both temperature profiles indicates a decrease in surface temperature of about 1.8degreeC, presumably resulting from reclamation of what was marshland in the early part of this century. A surprisingly low heat flow of 0.3 HFU (F HFU=10/sup -6/ cal/cm/sup 2/s=41.8 mW/cm/sup 2/) was measured at site LS near the center of the basin. At site OC-1,7 km east of LS and 2 km from the Klamath Hills geothermal zone, the heat flow was 1.44 HFU, also a low value in this setting. Temperature profiles in 15 unused water wells in the area had linear gradients ranging from 47degree to 170degreeC/km. The corresponding lower limits of heat flow (conductivities measured at the two heat flow sites being used) range from 0.8 to 3.1 HFU. These variations in heat flow evidently are caused by temperature variations in a convecting system within the near-surface volcanic rocks and do not provide firm constraints on the nature sources at depth.

A slotted casing was installed in the bottom 4300 ft of the well, drilling mud was flushed from the hole, a series of pumping tests were conducted to obtain temperature and pressure measurements, and the well was flashed for a short period early in July 1976. The next step, a 4 to 6 week flash within the next two months, will explore recharging capabilities. At least two more comparative test wells probably will be drilled before a prototype powerplant is built. Power could be on the line within four years if the project proceeds on schedule.

A relatively well documented area shows some of the highest temperature gradients recorded in the UK. Fairly extensive regions are known to have gradients over 40/sup 0/C/km and as these tend to correlate with deep sections of the sedimentary basin there are good prospects for obtaining heat in the range 150--200/sup 0/C. The temperature at the bottom of one hole drilled for oil topped 160/sup 0/C. It is suggested that heat recovered from hot rocks or hot aquifers might cost less at the well-head than low-temperature heat from imported oil. It estimates that the heat beneath each square kilometer of hot rock could be recoverable at a rate equivalent to 200,000--300,000 tons/year of coal for 20 years, while hot aquifers might yield heat equivalent to 50,000 tons/year of coal per sq km over the same period.

Horizontal sections through vertical fractures may be subjected to symmetric pressure gradients by locating inflow and outflow wells near the fracture center and tips. A dumbbell form, resulting from flow from the tips toward the center, has a limital length beyond which the fracture closes at the center and propagates unstably at the tips. A diamond form, resulting from the opposite sense of flow, has no limital length and a stable propagation.

This case involved conflicting claims to the geothermal steam system which underlies 408 acres of essentially unimproved mountain property lying south of Big Sulfur Creek in an area known as ''The Geysers'' in Sonoma County, California. A history of the land and mineral rights transfers since 1925 is reviewed. The Federal government and California recognize a geothermal system as being an energy resource. It was concluded at the hearing that the energy produced is a direct product of the molten minerals and gases within the resource. The water which transports the energy to the surface is a conveyor belt, nothing more. The total resource has all of the basic characteristics of those resources which the courts have classified as minerals on many occasions in many jurisdictions. The water condensed from the resource is not necessary for or beneficial to the use of the land. The surface owner wants the energy which the water carries, not the water itself. It is for these reasons that the court held that the plaintiff is the owner and entitled to the possession and control of all the geothermal steam and power and geothermal resources in and under the subject property by virtue of its leasehold interest.

The data provide new information on the hydrothermal circulation that probably controls the crustal temperature distribution near ocean ridge spreading centers. Nearly constant very low heat flow of 0.6 +- 0.1 ..mu..cal cm/sup -2/ s/sup -1/ (25 +- 4 mW m/sup 2/) was found for three deep holes and three standard ocean probe measurements across one 3-km-wide sediment pond on 3.5-m.y.-old sea floor and to a depth of 400 m into the underlying basaltic basement. The heat flow predicted by conductive cooling models of plate accretion is much higher, about 6.4 ..mu..cal cm/sup -2/ s/sup -1/ (270 mW m/sup -2/). The result suggests that heat is carried to the surface by extensive hydrothermal circulation that extends at least to the lower part of layer 2, such that the heat flux based on conductive estimates represents only a fraction of the total flux. A borehole into 16-m.y.-old sea floor appears to have penetrated a convective system. Temperature measurements in the basement part indicate that seawater was flowing rapidly down the hole into a permeable horizon near the bottom at 324-m depth. The heat flow of 0.5 ..mu..cal cm/sup -2/ s/sup -1/(21 mW m/sup -2/) measured in the overlying sediments suggests that before the hole was drilled,water at about 10degreeC may have been flowing horizontally in this horizon.

Precise relative hypocenters were obtained for 264 earthquakes (M/sub L/ greater than or equal to 1.5) using a master event method to calibrate the USGS Imperial Valley array. These locations together with well-constrained focal mechanisms for 16 of the largest events suggest faulting on at least three distinct structures.

The swarm began on a nearly vertical right-lateral fault striking N8 W (Brawley fault) about 8 km southeast of Brawley at a point which had experienced enhanced shallow seismicity during the preceding 4 days.

No intermediate crystalline phases in the transition from amorphous silica to quartz were detected. Chalcedony that made up the synthetic spherulites was either length-slow, length-fast, or both, depending on the experimental conditions. These findings contrast with the hypothesis that chalcedony derived from silica gel should be length-fast. In experiments in which blue-green algae had been embedded in the silica gel, spherulite nucleation occurred preferentially on surfaces of particulate organic matter, and the chalcedony generally was length-slow. A summary of spherulitic crystallization mechanisms is presented, and emphasis is placed on impurity and viscosity requirements. Considering these requirements and the experimental results, a viscous colloidal origin is postulated for cherts and other siliceous sedimentary rocks that contain abundant silica microspheres. The seemingly biological attributes of quartz microspheres in Precambrian iron formation cherts can be explained by strictly inorganic processes related to spherulitic crystallization of colloidal precursors.","","","Commonwealth Scientific and Industrial Research Organization, Canberra, Australia","","","United States","1976-08-01T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: Geol.

The way in which heat-flow data constrain the current hypotheses of crustal structure and evolution of the Sierra Nevada-Basin and Range provinces is illustrated with a tectonic model that employs a post-Cretaceous shallow-dipping subduction zone beneath the Sierra Nevada and an active upper-mantle diapir under the Basin and Range province during late Cenozoic time.","","","Univ. of Southern California","","","United States","1976-08-01T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: Geol.

Although the number of images needed is large, they are easy to compute and many of them occupy the same position, thereby the amount of necessary computation is drastically reduced. A computer program based on the method of images is used to give normalized total-field apparent resistivity contours for bipole--dipole arrays.

Wind energy is widely available but irregular and variable, the basic problem being storage. Tidal and wave power are of practical interest only to large electricity supply organizations; wave power is more of a conventional base-load energy source for which storage is needed if the full potential is to be realized; an expanded tidal scheme could provide this storage because it is complementary to any primary source. Estuaries like the Severn provide suitable conditions--pumping at night combined with an intermittent tidal input can give steady daytime output to meet up to 30 percent of the present maximum excess of daytime over night load; no other storage is needed for either source. This would reduce by 40 percent the amount of thermal plant operating by day and would lower total thermal generating capacity by 10 percent. Technical and economic constraints are present for geothermal energy, but the total heat content under Britain is enough to supply all her energy needs at present consumption rates, for 20,000 years. Solar energy is by far the most versatile of the renewable sources. Thermal applications for space heating, hot water heating, and electricity generation through solar thermal power cycles are well known. Solar cells are potentially an attractive means of generating electricity for all sectors (except transportation) because they have no running costs or moving parts and no waste products. The present capital cost is too high to be competitive. The economics of the development of all the alternative sources is summarized.

The values obtained are ..gamma../sub 0/'(identical with (d..gamma../d..delta..)parallel bar/sub ..delta.. = 0/) = 3.0 for sodium chloride and ..gamma../sub 0/' = 2.0 for quartz. Corresponding values of the parameter q(identical with ..gamma../sub 0/'/..gamma../sub 0/) are 1.9 and 2.8, in reasonable agreement with values obtained by other methods. It is suggested that this method be further investigated as a means of obtaining ..gamma../sub 0/' and q from thermal data. A model for the lattice thermal conductivity of the mantle to the core boundary is presented. The model suggests that increases in conductivity with pressure due to lattice conduction processes in the mantle are less than 2.0 percent/kbar or 0.7 percent/km. Under conditions of normal geothermal gradient in the crust and upper mantle the increase in lattice conductivity due to the pressure effect will be substantially less than the decrease due to the temperature effect. A minimum value of lattice conductivity is attained in the region of the olivine-spinel phase change, 400 km. The lattice conductivity may increase by a factor of 3 at the depth of the spinel-postspinel phase change owing to the high conductivity of the dense oxide phases. The lattice contribution to the thermal conductivity at the mantle-core boundary is approximately 0.01 cal/cm s/sup 0/K.","","","Univ. of California, Los Angeles","","","United States","1976-06-10T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: J.

A transient line source method was modified for use in a piston-cylinder high-pressure cell. Pressure gradients were determined by experiments with bismuth foils. The pressure dependence of the thermal diffusivity of 40/sup 0/C for the substances studied may be represented as follows (kappa in square centimeters per second, P in kilobars): for the low-pressure phases of Teflon, Teflon I-II, P is less than 5.5 kbar, kappa = 0.0012 + 3.6 x 10/sup -5/ P; for the high-pressure phase, Teflon III, 5.5 kbar is less than P is less than 35 kbar, kappa = 0.0012 + 8.0 x 10/sup -5/ P; for polycrystalline halite, P is less than 18 kbar, kappa = 0.0031 + 9.5 x 10/sup -4/ P; for quartz, perpendicular to the c axis, P is less than 30 kbar, kappa = 0.031 + 5.3 x 10/sup -4/ P; for silica glass, P is less than 36 kbar, kappa = 0.0068 - 6.7 x 10/sup -6/ P. The diffusivity of silica glass decreases with pressure, in contrast to the diffusivity of its crystalline counterpart, quartz, which increases with pressure. In addition to the diffusivity the thermal conductivity of Teflon was determined by measuring the power applied to the heater wire. The thermal conductivity of a Teflon I-II mixture is approximatey constant at 0.0075 to 0.0078 cal/cm s /sup 0/K to 5.5 kbar. Above 5.5 kbar the conductivity of Teflon III is given by K = 0.0062 + 4.0 x 10/sup -5/ P. The specific heat of Teflon decreases with pressure and decreases discontinuously by 15 percent across the Teflon II-III phase change, in good agreement with the decrease predicted from thermal expansion and compressibility data.","","","","","","United States","1976-06-10T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: J.

The algorithm is based on the method of successive reductions to lower boundary plane of the resistivity transform function. A novel aspect of the algorithm is that error limits are assigned to the initial values of the resistivity transform, and these error limits are carried through in all the subsequent computations. The width of the error range is then used as the basis for assigning weight factors in the final computation of thicknesses and resistivities of the layers. The errors in the resistivity transform derived from the solution given by the algorithm are usually not more than twice as large as those in the original data.","","","Technological Univ., Delft, Netherlands","","","United States","1976-06-01T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: Geophys.

To avoid this problem, the solubility product constant for calcite in seawater was determined in the present study by calculation from new measurements of the aragonite solubility product constant in seawater and the differential solubility of calcite and aragonite in carbonated distilled water. All measured equilibria were reversed, and redundant measurement of pH, P/sub CO/sub 2/, calcium concentration, and carbonate alkalinity was used as a check on the results. The resultant calculated values of K'/sub e/ = (Ca/sup + +/) (CO/sub 3//sup - -/) for 34.5 percent seawater and 1 atm total pressure are: K'/sub c/ = 5.94 +- 0.39 x 10/sup -7/ at 25/sup 0/C, K'/sub c/ = 7.98 +- 0.43 x 10/sup -7/ at 5/sup 0/C, where c refers to calcite, and units of K'/sub c/ are mol/sup 2/ l/sup -2/. The analogous measured values for aragonite in seawater are: K'/sub a/ = 8.76 +- 0.40 x 10/sup -7/ at 25/sup 0/C, K'/sub a/ = 11.4 +- 0.50 x 10/sup -7/ at 5/sup 0/C. The difference in solubility between calcite and aragonite determined is in good agreement with thermodynamic measurements of others. Recalculation, using the new K'/sub e/ data, of the state of saturation of the Atlantic and Pacific Oceans from the data of Takahashi (1975) shows that the lysocline, north of 30/sup 0/S, in both oceans is found well below the saturation depth for calcite and occurs near where accelerated dissolution, based on similarly recalculated laboratory results, is to be expected. However, additional indirect determinations of calcite solubility, especially for elevated pressures, are needed to check these conclusions.","","","Yale Univ., New Haven","","","United States","1976-06-01T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: Am.

The existence of a uniform matrix of Serpentine and Brucite enclosing unaltered grains of Olivine and other minerals can hardly come about by water diffusion within a boundary, such as from a tectonic fault zone. However, shattering into sandsize particles is commonly observed in the static fatigue failure of rock under compression. Similarly, the penetration of water into shrinkage cracks with a spacing of the order of 10-30 cm should be reflected in the metamorphic fabric of the gabbros that overlie the ultramafics in the oceanic crust. The actual crack separation is not well determined by the theory, because of problems in the formulation of the cracking boundary condition, probable errors in the calculation of heat transport in porous convecting systems, and poor knowledge of the physics of mafic rock. An open-minded study of the rocks available in Ophiolite suites may help to determine some of these parameters.","","","Univ. of Washington, Seattle","","","United States","1976-05-01T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: EOS, Trans., Am.

The rate of hydrothermal heat advection was obtained by computing the difference (40 +- 4 x 10/sup 18/ cal/yr) between the theoretical heat production associated with sea-floor spreading and observed heat flow measurements. Effects of exothermic chemical reactions, direct heat loss from flows extruded on the ocean floor, and heat of crystallization of basalt were minor and yielded insignificant contributions to the estimate. The majority of dredged ocean-floor metamorphic rocks appear to represent the products of intensive hydrothermal reaction with hot sea water. The chemical trends (loss of Ca and K, gain of Mg, Na, and H/sub 2/O) and alteration mineral assemblages of these rocks closely resemble those observed in both laboratory alteration experiments and in subaerial geothermal systems where seawater circulates in hot basic rocks. Alteration of oceanic crust appears strongly dependent on the presence of permeable features, especially cracks, and may be restricted mainly within the vicinity of major fault zones. An examination of submarine weathering, volcanic effusion, and hydrothermal mass transfers between basaltic crust and seawater for silica, manganese, and iron demonstrated that the relative importance of the three processes may vary markedly from element to element. A similar examination of magnesium, calcium, oxidants-reductants, and water indiated that only about a kilometer or less of basalt actually reacts with seawater in hydrothermal systems.","","","Northwestern Univ., Evanston, IL","","","United States","1976-05-01T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: J.

Non-Newtonian flow structures differ slightly from corresponding Newtonian flows. The principal effect of the non-Newtonian viscosity is to increase the effective Rayleigh number.

This anomalous, low heat flow zone appears to be related to a graben which is found as a continuous, fault-bounded trough, offset by fracture zones and trending parallel to the present spreading center. Thin sediment, symmetric magnetic anomalies, shoaling topography, and a topographic step between the graben and the present spreading center suggest that it is the central rift valley of a fossil spreading center which jumped to the south approximately 4 m.y. B.P. The low heat flow measurements appear to be a manifestation of our inability to measure convective heat transfer in this area of thin sediment cover. The thin sediment cover appears to be caused by (1) the youth of the fossil ridge crest relative to the surrounding sea floor and (2) burial by extrusive activity which might have continued after the major components of sea floor spreading jumped to the presently active ridge crest.","","","","","","United States","1976-04-10T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: J.

In such cases, very often saline hot water is transferred from the deep layers of the aquifer into the upper layers. There is an hypothesis that such a mechanism does exist in the deep regions of the Floridan aquifer. However, the deep zone of the Floridan aquifer is extremely cavernous. Therefore even very slow motions may lead to an intensive dispersion of soluted materials and heat as well as to turbulent effects demonstrated by the invalidity of the laminar Darcy law. In this study, all these effects and their connection with the onset of thermohaline convection were investigated. It was found possible to define in the field a plane where applied perturbations are the most disturbing to the flow field. In this plane, convection motions are initiated. This plane formed an angle theta/sub c/ with the unperturbed velocity vector. Angle theta/sub c/ varied according to flow conditions between 0 and 90 degrees. Approaches were developed for the determination of instability criteria for different regions of the Reynolds number.","","","Univ. of Florida, Gainesville","","","United States","1976-04-01T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: Water Resour.

A general empirical equation for the temperature dependence of the heat capacity of a species and derived functional relations for entropy, enthalpy, free energy, equilibrium constant, and electrochemical potential provides a mathematical model, whereby internally consistent analytical representations of thermodynamic functions may be obtained by multiple regression on experimental data. Programmining is simplified by defining the free energies of elements to be zero at 298.15/sup 0/K and the selected reference pressure. Conversion to other conventions is readily made after regression is completed. Error plots obtained from the initial parameter adjustment help to identify inconsistent data. Where justifiable, such data are rejected, and additional regressions are made to obtain an internally consistent description of the data. The species-related parameters from the final evaluation are then used with the mathematical model to calculate the thermochemical properties of the species considered. Application of this procedure is described, using, as examples, studies in the system Fe-C-H-O to derive thermodynamic functions for iron and its oxides and analysis of the system N-H-O to correlate the aqueous solubility of N/sub 2/ and NH/sub 3/ and the equilibrium between aqueous NH/sub 3/ and NH/sub 4//sup +/.","","","Geological Survey, Reston, VI","","","United States","1976-04-01T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: Am.

The dipolar anomaly, consisting of negative and positive components differing amplitude by approximately l V, is centered over a resurgent dome in the west central part of the caldera. The exact nature of the potential source is unknown; however, electrofiltration processes caused by movement of heated groundwater that gives rise to streaming potentials are thought to be the principal cause of the dipolar anomaly. Diffusion potentials resulting from concentration differences between rising volcanic water and descending meteoric water may be responsible for the negative potentials measured within the caldera.

Microearthquakes with ray paths external to the geothermal field have sharp arrivals and short periods. Microearthquakes with hypocenters located within the 150 sq km areal extent of the geothermal field have longer periods and more emergent first arrivals. High frequency seismic waves from local microearthquakes in the region are attenuated as they cross the geothermal field. In addition, shear waves are absent on some records and difficult to distinguish on others. To map the fine structures of the subsurface and to measure the anisotropy and lateral variations of the compressional wave velocity in the immediate area of the East Mesa Geothermal Field, we exploded six calibration blasts of strengths ranging from 9 to 90 kg. The shotholes, ranging in depth from 15 to 60 m, were arranged to give a reasonable distribution of directions and areal coverage. Detailed analysis of the refraction records indicates anomalous delays in the travel times along certain ray paths. We propose that a low velocity region, with horizontal dimensions of a few kilometers, is present beneath the East Mesa Geothermal Field and can be used to delineate the anomalous thermal region.","","","Univ. of Texas, Dallas","","","United States","1976-03-01T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: EOS, Trans., Am.

Surface volcanic rocks of the field consist of five small rhyolite domes extruded onto Quaternary sediments of the Colorado River delta. Two domes are linked by subaqueous pyroclastic deposits; the others are single extrusions with or without marginal lava flows. The domes are low-calcium, alkali rhyolite with 1 to 2 percent crystals. Similar silicic rocks found in wells have been extensively altered by geothermal brines. Basaltic rocks occur as xenoliths in the domes and as subsurface dikes, sills, or flows. The xenoliths consist of low-potassium tholeiitic basalt similar to that of the East Pacific Rise. Subsurface basaltic rocks are mineralogically similar to the xenoliths but have undergone extensive hydrothermal alteration. Numerous partly melted granitic xenoliths in the domes show various degrees of either cotectic melting along quartz-feldspar grain boundaries or disequilibrium incongruent melting of hydrous ferromagnesian minerals. These rocks are sodic granite containing notably higher SiO/sub 2/, CaO, and Na/sub 2/O and lower total iron than the enclosing rhyolite. Compositions and textures suggest that the granite xenoliths are fragments of basement rather than the crystallized equivalents of the rhyolite magma. The bimodal basalt-rhyolite assemblage of the Salton Sea geothermal field is believed to have formed by partial fusion in two stages of mantle peridotite, forming successive rhyolitic and basaltic melts. After formation, the rhyolitic magma was partly contaminated by continental crust material.","","","","","","United States","1976-03-01T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: Geol.

The depression contains two major basins, a larger and deeper one making up much of the eastern part and a somewhat smaller, more shallow one to the west; a positive feature underlying the central part of the depression separates the two basin areas. The east side of this feature is linear in plan and coincides with the extension of the Hilton Creek fault which is mapped within and beyond the south edge of the caldera. The indicated relief on the postulated subsurface Hilton Creek fault together with difference in depth of the eastern and western basinal areas indicates that the eastern basin is downdropped in relation to the western one. Gentle gravity gradients outside the caldera but sloping towards it are interpreted as evidence of a low-density mass located below the caldera fill. It is concluded that it is probably related to the magma source. Aeromagnetic data indicate that a northwest-trending belt of metasedimentary rocks on the south flank of Long Valley may extend into the caldera proper and form much of the bedrock floor of the western part of the caldera. A magnetic low of shallow source in the hot spring region in the southwest is thought to be caused by hydrothermal alteration of the ferrimagnetic minerals in the underlying rocks. A broad positive magnetic anomaly near the center of the caldera may be caused by a thick section of magnetic volcanic flow lying east of the projected Hilton Creek fault and underlying much of the eastern basin.","","","Geological Survey, Denver","","","United States","1976-02-10T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: J.

Where the temperature at a depth of 10 m is less than 11/sup 0/C (group I), the gradients to 30 m are practically zero; where the 10-m temperature is between 11/sup 0/C and 16/sup 0/C (group II), the gradients are 200/sup 0/-400/sup 0/C/km and uniform corresponding to conductive heat flows of 4-8 HFU (1 HFU = 1 x 10/sup -6/ cal/cm/sup 2/s). Where the 10-m temperatures exceed 16/sup 0/C (group III), gradients are larger and irregular, with local heat flows to 50 HFU. Thermal considerations suggest that the first group is characteristic of regions of hydrologic recharge, that the second group is probably characteristic of regions with conductive regimes to substantial depth, and that the third group is characteristic of regions of hydrologic discharge. This interpretation is supported by limited drilling to depths up to 300 m. Regimes in group I occur in the peripheral portion of the caldera, suggesting that this is an area of recharge. The hot springs discharge in a fault zone characterized by near-surface regimes in groups II and III; chemical evidence indicates that their source reservoir is at about 200/sup 0/C. Evidently, the springs are fed by local fractures; if the background regime is conductive, their reservoirs are probably less than 1 km deep. Hydrologic and isotopic data indicate that gross circulation in the hydrothermal system is from west to east, suggesting that the hot springs gain their heat in the western caldera. The large estimates of heat being removed from the caldera by flowing water and the geologic inference that hydrothermal activity was more intense in the past support the view that the Long Valley system was resupplied with heat from deep magmatic sources during its eruptive history.","","","","","","United States","1976-02-10T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: J.

The data show no conspicuous effect of the province transition, possibly a small local heat flow anomaly near the east rim of the caldera, and a very substantial anomaly near the west rim. Simple heat conduction models suggest that Long Valley caldera is the surface expression of a deep magmatic system; an upper crustal magma chamber could not have sustained molten material throughout the 2-m.y. eruptive history unless it were resupplied with heat from deep crustal or subcrustal magmatic sources. If the heat were supplied by crustal intrusion of mantle basalt, the crust would thicken rapidly unless magmatic activity were accompanied by accelerated local crustal spreading. To generate a viable silicic magma chamber by sill injection in the upper 5-8 km of crust, minimum intrusion rates of the order of 1 m per century are probably required. Thermal models for the near-normal heat flow at the east rim suggest that magma beneath the eastern part of Long Valley caldera might have been exhausted during eruption of the Bishop Tuff 0.7 m.y. ago and that the resurgent dome, which subsequently formed in the west central caldera, marks the location of a residual chamber more circular in plan. High heat flow indicated by the single measurement near the west rim can be attributed to a simple shallow magma chamber beneath the western caldera or to recent local magmatism along the Sierra frontal fault system.","","","Geological Survey, Menlo Park, CA","","","United States","1976-02-10T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: J.

Thermal waters of sodium bicarbonate-chloride composition are usually associated with hot-water reservoirs. Chloride concentrations and stable isotope data indicate that the thermal waters have had varied histories. All of the thermal springs issue a mixture of fluid from the thermal reservoir and less saline, cooler water from one or more shallow aquifers. The composition of springs in Hot Creek Gorge may have been further altered by minor subsurface boiling. Thermal springs between Hot Creek and Lake Crowley issue mixtures of fresh and thermal waters which have lost heat by conductive cooling and changed composition by reaction with rock in the shallow aquifer. The silica content of water from Magma Richie 5 and mixing calculations based on the concentrations of silica in thermal waters collected from springs in Hot Creek Gorge and along Little Hot Creek indicate a temperature of at least 200/sup 0/C in the thermal reservoir. The sodium-potassium-calcium geothermometer yields a reservoir temperature estimate near 200/sup 0/C for most of the thermal springs. If geothermal energy is developed in Long Valley, the high concentrations of arsenic (up to 2.2 mg/l), boron (up to 15 mg/l), and total dissolved solids in the thermal fluids will make it necessary to isolate the effluent of production wells from freshwater system.","","","Geological Survey, Menlo Park, CA","","","United States","1976-02-10T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: J.

Holocene rhyolitic and phreatic eruptions suggest that residual magma was present in the chamber as recently as 450 yr ago. Intracaldera hydrothermal activity began at least 0.3 m.y. ago and was widespread in the caldera moat; it has since declined due to self-sealing of near-surface caldera sediments by zeolitization, argillization, and silicification and has become localized on recently reactivated northwest-trending Sierra Nevada frontal faults that tap hot water at depth.","","","","","","United States","1976-02-10T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: J.

S. Geological Survey's geothermal investigations. Spatial variation of the average noise power shows high levels of noise extending over most of the eastern half of the Long Valley caldera. Since the noise high is almost similar in extent to the soft sedimentary Owens River basin, it is possible that ground amplification of seismic waves is at least partially responsible for the noise anomaly. Two lines of evidence indicate that geothermal noise may be present in Long Valley. (1) Relative amplification of teleseismic waves over soft ground, with respect to a reference station on hard rock, is about 12 dB. The noise anomaly, however, is at least 12 dB higher than this value. It is therefore difficult to explain the anomaly by postulating ground amplification of regional noise, thus indicating that a noise source may be present in the area of the anomaly. At wave frequencies below 2 Hz, river and cattle noise do not contribute much to the anomaly. (2) Group velocities of seismic noise, measured by using arrays, are in general quite low except at a few stations along the southern edge of the noise anomaly. The wave azimuths in the low-velocity areas show random propagation, whereas azimuths associated with the high-velocity waves point to the area where surface geothermal phenomena are found. The high-velocity waves also have frequencies below 2 Hz. If a noise source is present under the southern edge of the sedimentary basin, it could excite the basin much more than it does the hard ground directly above it and thus produce the observed noise anomaly.","","","Geological Survey, Menlo Park, CA","","","United States","1976-02-10T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: J.

These anomalies and other parts of the caldera were investigated in detail with 49 Schlumberger dc soundings and 13 transient electromagnetic soundings. An extensive conductive zone of 1- to 10-..cap omega..m resistivity was found to be the cause of the total field resistivity lows. Drill hole information indicates that the shallow parts of the conductive zone in the eastern part of the caldera contain water of only 73/sup 0/C and consist of highly zeolitized tuffs and ashes in the places that were tested. A deeper zone near Whitmore Hot Springs is somewhat more promising in potential for hot water, but owing to the extensive alteration prevalent in the caldera the presence of hot water cannot be definitely assumed.

As in part 1, the earth's crust is assumed to be a two-dimensional, isotropic, homogeneous, semi-infinite medium with constant thermal conductivity and zero surface temperature. In part 1 the dike is approximated by an isotherm of rectangular shape with temperature T/sub 0/ and width 2B, extending vertically from depth D to depth H. In the present paper a case H = infinity is studied; namely, the dike is approximated by an isotherm of rectangular shape with temperature T/sub 0/ and width 2B, extending vertically from depth D to infinity. By the method of conformal mapping, mathematical formulas are developed to describe isotherms, flow lines, and surface heat flow as a function of parameters specifying the intrusion, i.e., T/sub 0/, D, and B. Relationships among the parameters that specify the dike (T/sub 0/, D, B) and the heat flow anomaly (peak height Q/sub m/ and width x/sub ..gamma../) are illustrated. The formula of surface heat flow obtained in the present paper is not identical with that obtained by Von Herzen and Uyeda. It is shown that the latter formula of surface heat flow does not correspond to a dike represented by a rectangular isotherm.","","","Columbia Univ., Palisades, NY","","","United States","1976-02-10T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: J.

The Maxwell model for the thermal conductivity of a two-component material, a model which has frequently been successfully used for relatively small values of porosity (<0.1) and moderate conductivity ratios (<10), may be extended to much wider ranges of these parameters (0.3 and 300, respectively) by the use of appropriate correction factors obtainable from data already in the literature. Significant errors due to overlooking a thermal contact resistance have been detected in some experimental work. The errors can be as high as 50 percent in the measured value for an air-filled sandstone of 0.2 porosity. Unless corrected, such errors can contribute a great deal to the lack of agreement between computed and experimental values. Correction for these errors also leads to much better consistency among published experimental values measured with various techniques. Conductivity values accurate to better than 15 percent may therefore be predicted for specimens saturated with low conductivity fluids such as air, steam, or oil.","","","Univ. of Western Ontario, London","","","United States","1976-02-01T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: Geophysics; (United States); Journal Volume: 41:1","","Medium: X; Size: Pages: 133-144","","","","Journal ID: CODEN: GPYSA","10.1190/1.1440596","","2016-05-30T00:00:00Z","7248372","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/7248372","","Geophysics; (United States)","","41:1"

Corrections have been applied for variations in bottom water temperature, sedimentation, thermal refraction by the sediment prism, topography, warm-rim effect, Pleistocene thermal history, uplift, and erosion. The accuracy of the values is about +-0.3 ..mu..cal cm/sup -2/ s/sup -1/ (+- 13 mW m/sup -2/). The relative accuracy between the values is about half of this range. The data indicate a pattern of low heat flow from the coast inland about 200 km to the heads of the inlets (13 values average 0.9 ..mu..cal cm/sup -2/ s/sup -1/ or 37 mW m/sup -2/). Stations at the heads of two inlets (1.5 ..mu..cal cm/sup -2/ s/sup -1/ or 63 mW m/sup -2/) mark the transition to high heat flow further inland (about 2.0 ..mu..cal cm/sup -2/ s/sup -1/ or 84 mW m/sup -2/). From west to east the heat flow transition coincides with the first occurrence of recent volcanic centers and hot springs, the transition from high to low Bouguer gravity, and the transition to low deep crustal and upper mantle electrical resistivity and to recent regional uplift. The coast low heat flow is explained partly by low crustal radioactive heat production and in part by the heat sink effect of the cold oceanic Juan de Fuca plate being subducted along the continental margin. The high inland heat flow probably is produced by the upward convective transport of heat by magma and thinning of the lithosphere that occurs when the sinking plate reaches a depth where temperatures are sufficient for partial melting.","","","Dalhousie Univ., Halifax, Nova Scotia","","","United States","1976-01-10T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: J.

(1975) points out the very significant result that the extraction of geothermal energy is much more efficient if the water passes through a multiple fracture system than if the water passes through a single fracture. In particular, their results show that a given flow rate divided among N fractures gives a higher outlet temperature over a period of time than if the same amount of fluid flows through a single fracture. It appears, however, that their model is unnecessarily complicated and hence the physical significance of the model may be partially obscured. For this reason it is shown that essentially the same results may be obtained by solving the heat transfer equation for a single fracture and by treating the geothermal system as a number of N independent, vertical fractures.

It is hoped that a standard or near-standard form will emerge. The response to the potential of geothermal resources has been twofold: (1) regulating legislation, on both Federal and state levels, has increased; and (2) the body of knowledge surrounding geothermal resources has been growing rapidly. The literature of geothermal resources has discussed the state of the technological art, geology or geothermal resource occurrence, economics of geothermal resource development, and legal problems of geothermal resource exploration and development; one major topic awaiting treatment is the environmental aspect of geothermal resource development. This article draws upon both of the responses above, and in suggesting solutions to problems of drafting leases, refers to legislation and geothermal literature when appropriate.

A non-ideal model for the M2 site in both the pyroxenes is used to obtain the activity composition relations. The site occupancy data in orthopyroxene are available in the literature. The site occupancy data in clinopyroxene are obtained by using compositional data on three coexisting pyroxenes by using the condition that in such coexisting pyroxenes the intracrystalline equilibrium constants are simply related. Using the activity--composition data, the equation may be solved graphically or by using a computer to match the two sides of the equation at various assumed temperatures. The temperature estimates must be based on an accurate compositional analysis of several samples. It is expected that further work on the solution parameters and determination of site occupancies as a function of temperature and composition will be actively pursued to improve temperature estimates. The proposed geothermometer is recommended as a relative temperature scale to test models of chemical equilibrium and differentiation in metamorphic and igneous rocks.","","","City Univ. of New York, Brooklyn","","","United States","1976-01-01T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: Am.

Mixed-oxide compositions containing combinations of (Mg.Fe)O and SiO/sub 2/ which correspond to dunite-peridotite and pyroxenite were emphasized in the modelling procedure. Models in the compositional range dunite-peridotite were found to satisfy the P and S-wave velocities, as well as the density requirements below the 650 km discontinuity; satisfactory solutions were provided by such models when Fe/(Mg + Fe) = 0.15 +- 0.05 along an adiabatic temperature gradient of 1300/sup 0/C at zero pressure. Models of pyroxenite composition do not satisfy the physical properties of the mantle in the region of interest. The successful dunite-peridotite mixed-oxide compositional models provide an estimate of the geotherm in the 650 to 1200 km region of the mantle. Since the physical properties within the region of interest are satisfied along an adiabat, the problem is reduced to calculating the increase of temperature with depth for the preferred model along the adiabatic gradient (initial temperature 1300/sup 0/C). This procedure yields a geotherm which is consistent with several independent upper mantle temperature estimates. The present results indicate a temperature of 1600 +- 400/sup 0/C at 671 km; the primary source of uncertainty is the accuracy of the seismic model interpretations.","","","Pennsylvania State Univ., University Park","","","United States","1976-01-01T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: Am.

Temperature at the top of the low-velocity zone, equated with the onset of incipient melting, is generally 1100/sup 0/ +- 100/sup 0/C from a wide variety of evidence. The extensive melting detectable beneath mid-ocean ridges implies temperatures above 1250/sup 0/C in the shallow asthenosphere under spreading centers. Below a thermal boundary layer at the top of the asthenosphere, associated with convection on a scale secondary to plate motions, geotherms in the asthenosphere follow nearly adiabatic gradients and intersect the olivine-spinel transition at a temperature of 1300/sup 0/ +- 150/sup 0/C. The olivine--spinel transition is elevated about 100 km in subducted oceanic lithosphere, implying a 1000/sup 0/C temperature contrast between slab and normal mantle at 250 km depth. Systematic thermal differences between stable ocean basins and continental shields are necessary but are not likely to extend deeper than 200 km. Lateral temperature variations of perhaps 200/sup 0/C do persist deeper than 200 km and are probably associated with convective flow in the asthenosphere.","","","Massachusetts Inst. of Tech., Cambridge","","","United States","1976-01-01T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: Am.

The first set includes the uncertainties in defining the appropriate reactions and determining their temperature and pressure dependence for a useful range of ultramafic compositions. Currently, no technique offers a fully determined or satisfactory answer, but preliminary estimates offer a useful base for geological interpretation. The second problem, involving the evaluation of the geological context of the sample, is illustrated by comparison of the estimated equilibration temperatures and pressures for the Mount Albert ultramafic intrusion and xenoliths from the San Quintin alkali olivine basalt volcanic field. The Mount Albert mass, which has been intruded as a solid diapir into crustal rocks, is composed of a core of undeformed rocks equilibrated at higher temperatures and pressures than a more intensely deformed suite of rocks adjacent to the margin. The distribution of temperature and pressure outlines a trajectory rather than the ambient geothermal gradient. Xenoliths from San Quintin show the same range of deformational types and a comparable distribution in temperature-pressure space to the Mount Albert rocks. In addition, the distribution of textural types with temperature is the same in both cases, suggesting a comparable mode of origin. The similarity of textures and mineral chemistry for all spinel peridotite xenoliths and massifs suggests caution in their use for estimating ambient geothermal gradients. Rather it appears that the temperatures and pressures record their mode of emplacement.","","","Univ. of California, Davis","","","United States","1976-01-01T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: Am.

The tightly-bracketed reactions (1) talc = 3 enstatite + quartz + steam, and (2) talc + forsterite = 5 enstatite + steam permit the simultaneous calculation of the standard Gibbs free energies of formation for both orthoenstatite and talc: -1457.27 +- 4 kJ mol/sup -1/ and -5516.37 +- 10 kJ mol/sup -1/, respectively. Using the calculated free energies of talc and enstatite and six reversed brackets for four reactions involving anthophyllite (Greenwood, 1963), the standard Gibbs free energy of formation of anthophyllite was recomputed to be -11,331.8 kJ mol/sup -1/ with an estimated uncertainty of +- 17 kJ mol/sup -1/; this value is more positive than previous estimates because of the revised value for enstatite. The reversed brackets of Johannes (1968) for the reaction clinochrysotile + brucite = 2 forsterite + 3 steam were used to calculate the free energy of formation of clinochrysotile. The value obtained (-4,030.84 +- 4.0 kJ mol/sup -1/) agrees well with published values. As an independent check, the free energy of talc was calculated, using the calculated free energy of clinochrysotile and a single reversed bracket for the reaction 5 clinochrysotile = 6 forsterite + talc + steam (Chernosky, 1973). The result, -5,522.91 +- 15.62 kJ mol/sup -1/, is in satisfactory agreement with the above-cited value. The results confirm the geometry of the P--T diagram for anthophyllite, enstatite, talc, forsterite, quartz, and steam suggested by Greenwood, through inconsistencies in the slopes of Chernosky's experimental results and those of Greenwood remain to be resolved. Nevertheless, our results indicate that an internally consistent P--T net, using the experimental data of Chernosky (1976) and Greenwood (1963) for anthophyllite, enstatite, talc, forsterite, and quartz, should be possible.","","","","","","United States","1976-01-01T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: Am.

Used together with a set of partition coefficients derived from natural assemblages, these values allow independent estimates of pressure and temperature to be made for any single pyroxene phase in equilibrium with a second pyroxene and with either spinel or garnet; otherwise, minimum temperatures and maximum pressures are obtained. This method has been checked for consistency both internally (similar estimates for coexisting pyroxenes in equilibrium) and externally (agreement with independent observations). The geothermometers and geobarometers are applied to xenoliths from ''kimberlites'' of the Navajo Indian Reservation and to ophiolites from Western Newfoundland for both of which partial recrystallization into hydrous phases often prevented the use of any other technique. This method is also applied to determine pressure-temperature paths for partially reequilibrated textures, to derive pyroxene geotherms from xenocrysts, to detect disequilibrium between coexisting pyroxenes, and to reveal actual equilibration facies of complex parageneses. These studies support a remarkable shortening of Newfoundland ophiolitic sequences, originally 100 km thick, a shallow origin for the Navajo Reservation ''kimberlites,'' and an underthrusting of oceanic-type lithosphere beneath the western United States' crust.","","","State Univ. of New York, Stony Brook","","","United States","1976-01-01T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: Am.

To facilitate petrogenetic interpretation of various observed assemblages involving margarite, a complete elucidation of its compatibility relations in the system CaO--Al/sub 2/O/sub 3/--SiO/sub 2/--H/sub 2/O is a necessary first step. Applying the methods of experimental and theoretical phase equilibria, the phase relations of margarite in the above system were deciphered. It is found that the commonly observed assemblage margarite + quartz is stable to a maximum P/sub H/sub 2/O/ of 8.6 kbar, within a temperature range of 300 to 560/sup 0/C. This explains why quartz + margarite is restricted in nature to low- and medium-grade crustal metamorphic rocks. At P/sub H/sub 2/O/ in excess of 7 to 8.6 kbar, the assemblage quartz + margarite gives way to the high-pressure assemblage zoisite + kyanite. This is in agreement with the repeatedly reported zoisite + kyanite assemblage from many greenschist to amphibolite facies eclogites. Furthermore, if ..cap alpha../sub H/sub 2/O/ in the equilibrium fluid is reduced to 0.7 due to the presence of other inert gas species, zoisite + kyanite will be stabilized to as low a P/sub total/ as 6.1 kbar. The assemblage quartz + margarite may, therefore, be regarded as an indicator of low- to moderate-pressure regimes of rock metamorphism.","","","Ruhr Univ., Bochum, Ger.","","","United States","1976-01-01T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: Am.

Such variations are predominantly temperature-dependent, although both pyroxene end-members decrease slightly in amount with increases in pressure at constant temperature. Using simple thermodynamic mixing models of the solid solution phases participating in the subsolidus exchange reactions, two temperature estimations can be made of natural spinel--lherzolites from the experimental data of the synthetic system. The first temperature estimation is based on the equilibrium exchange of Mg/sub 2/Si/sub 2/O/sub 6/ between clinopyroxene and orthopyroxene at 12 kbar (equilibrium constant K/sub 1/) and the second temperature estimation is based on the equilibrium exchange of CaAl/sub 2/SiO/sub 6/ between clinopyroxene, olivine, and spinel at 12 kbar (equilibrium constant K/sub 2/). Two temperature estimations were made from each of the analyses of the coexisting minerals of spinel--lherzolites from alpine-type intrusions and nodules in basalt (analyses obtained from the literature). The estimated temperatures for the spinel--lherzolite nodules in basalt range from the water-undersaturated peridotite solidus to the anhydrous solidus, indicating a close genetic relationship with the host basalts or those of the same fractionation suite. The temperatures estimated for most spinel--lherzolite intrusions indicate solidus temperatures followed by a cooling history of partial reequilibration to subsolidus temperatures. These temperatures probably bear little, if any, relationship to those of a normal geothermal gradient.","","","","","","United States","1976-01-01T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: Am.

The results show the enstatite and diopside mutual solid solutions and also define the limited solid solutions towards olivine and quartz. Although the enstatite--diopside solvus is wider when olivine rather than quartz is a coexisting phase, the difference does not seriously affect the pyroxene solvus as a geothermometer. Thus, this geothermometer can be used without taking the coexisting phases other than pyroxenes into account. The study of the enstatite--diopside solvus in the Mg/sub 2/Si/sub 2/O/sub 6/--CaMgSi/sub 2/O/sub 6/ system was extended above 1500/sup 0/C at 20 and 30 kbar.

The iron-free pigeonite--diopside solvus which was previously found at 20 kbar and inferred to be stable at 30 kbar did not appear at these pressures. The phase equilibrium data in this paper are combined with those in the literature to make a compilation of the enstatite--diopside solvus over a wide temperature-pressure range.

Fusion curves for mantle mineral assemblages involving forsterite, orthopyroxene, and clinopyroxene in the presence of CO/sub 2/, extending from higher temperature regions, terminate at these same invariant points. The points are connected by a series of liquidus reactions involving the carbonates and mantle silicates, at temperatures generally lower than the silicate-CO/sub 2/ melting reactions. Experimental data and theoretical analysis permit construction of a series of partly schematic phase diagrams. Petrological and geophysical conclusions include the following: (1) Free CO/sub 2/ cannot exist in the mantle; it is stored as carbonate. (2) CO/sub 2/ appears to be as effective as H/sub 2/O in causing incipient melting of mantle peridotite, and this remains our preferred explanation for the seismic low-velocity zone. (3) At depths greater than about 80 km, mantle peridotite with CO/sub 2/ (as carbonate) yields carbonatitic magmas with about 40 percent CO/sub 2/ and 10 percent silicates in solution; with progressive fusion the liquid becomes kimberlitic. (4) Primary carbonatite or kimberlite magmas rising from the asthenosphere must evolve CO/sub 2/ near 80 km depth, which would contribute to their explosive eruption. (5) Through a wide pressure range, SiO/sub 2/-undersaturated basic magmas with CO/sub 2/ in solution can yield residual kimberlitic or carbonatitic magmas.

Heat flux in this range characterizes the postvolcanic environment on Surtsey in which the subaerial palogonitization of basaltic tephra is associated with mass transfer of hydrothermal vapor, either of meteoric or sea-water origin, only a few years after cessation of eruptive activity. The flux estimation is the result of the Surtsey data-relay experiment via Landsat-1 which was carried out in several phases. Successful field installation and test transmissions demonstrated the feasibility of repetitive long-distance (that is, 4,800-km) data transmission and reception from a volcanic environment in Iceland via the Landsat Data Collection System. Temperature data were transmitted for a 38-day period in November and December 1972. A near-surface vertical gradient of 69.4/sup 0/C/m was obtained, suggesting a mixed mechanism of heat transfer, partitioned between conduction and convection. Comparison of four methods for estimating fluxes between 500 and 1,500 ..mu..cal cm/sup -2/s/sup -1/, using temperature data derived from the Data Collection Platform, suggests that, where the only temperature available are from the surface and a depth of 1 m, methods of estimating the net geothermal flux from examination of spectral radiance are superior to methods that assume dominant convection or conduction. A computerized thermal-modeling technique to construct parametric diurnal surface-temperature curves is particularly applicable. Flux-estimation methods that assume dominant convection or conduction are limited by the lack of temperature data at greater depths and lack of knowledge of the exact energy partition.","","","","","","United States","1976-01-01T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: J.

The results can be used in formulating mathematical models of the first loop of geothermal power plants.","","","","","","United States","1976-01-01T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: Heat Transfer - Sov.

Unless this is done, geothermal energy will supply only a small fraction of our energy needs and for a relatively short time. A number of countries are already tapping geothermal fields, but the U.S., with two million known acres of geothermal fields, is the largest producer. Leasing of geothermal fields began in 1970 with the Geothermal Steam Act and directions to ERDA to develop a national goal and program for fiscal-year 1977. Wells are drilled 4000 to 10,000 feet deep to tap either steam to turn turbines or hot water to boil a secondary substance. Total known and anticipated resources are estimated to be able to produce 153,000 megawatts for 30 years. Site locations are important because geothermal energy cannot be transported. Other possibilities for earth heat energy are zones of superheated, pressurized fluids found in the Gulf Coast area and areas of dry hot rock close to the earth's surface in New Mexico. Environmental difficulties arise because the best locations for geothermal sources are also those valued and protected by environmentalists for their scenic and cultural quality and their proximity to areas of volcanic activity. The noise and equipment necessary for drilling operations create a heavy industrial atmosphere which is incompatible with scenic lands. An estimated 20 percent of land surface in a developed field is altered by erosion and siltation. Air and vegetation are polluted by large emissions of hydrogen sulfite gas; water by drilling muds, brines, and steam condensates.

Starting from this geological situation, models of increasing complexity are proposed to study cooling by heat conduction of a system composed of parallel dikes and underlying magmatic chamber. This work was carried out by numerical methods which take into account the variation with temperature of the thermic parameters and by using an analytical solution of the Fourier equation (an initial fictive temperature is then calculated). The thermic individuality of the dikes disappears quickly, and the dike system may be replaced by a single ''intrusion'' which cools slowly from a temperature = 2/..beta.. theta/sub 0/ much lower than theta/sub 0/ (theta/sub 0/ = initial temperature; 1/..beta.. = injection density). The temperature gradient due to the dike system was estimated for different time intervals after the intrusion. For the calculation of the thermal effect of a magmatic chamber, its size, depth and age were taken into account. Numerical application for appropriate geological cases were carried out, and the respective effects of dikes and magma chamber were estimated.","","","Universite des Sciences et Techniques du Languedoc, Montpellier, France","","","United States","1976-01-01T00:00:00Z","French","Journal Article","","Journal Name: Bull.

The Maxwell model for the thermal conductivity of a two-component material, a model which has frequently been successfully used for relatively small values of porosity (<0.1) and moderate conductivity ratios (<10), may be extended to much wider ranges of these parameters (0.3 and 300, respectively) by the use of appropriate correction factors obtainable from data already in the literature. Significant errors due to overlooking a thermal contact resistance have been detected in some experimental work. The errors can be as high as 50 percent of the measured value for an air-filled sandstone of 0.2 porosity. Unless corrected, such errors can contribute a great deal to the lack of agreement between computed and experimental values. Correction for these errors also leads to much better consistency among published experimental values measured with various techniques. Conductivity values accurate to better than 15 percent may therefore be predicted for specimens saturated with low conductivity fluids such as air, steam, or oil.","","","","","","United States","1976-01-01T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: Log Anal.; (United States); Journal Volume: 17:6","","Medium: X; Size: Pages: 30-38","","","","Journal ID: CODEN: LGALA","10.1190/1.1440596","","2016-04-11T00:00:00Z","7315662","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/7315662","","Log Anal.; (United States)","","17:6"

Following Philip and de Vries, it was assumed that the flux of water in each phase is proportional to the gradient of the pressure in that phase and that the diffusive component of the flux of heat is proportional to the gradient of the temperature. Clapeyron equations were used to express the gradient of the pressure in any phase in terms of the gradient of the pressure in a reference state and of the temperature. The reference state may be the water in one of the phases or the water in some measuring device such as a tensiometer or a psychrometer. Expressions for the total flux of water and for the diffusive flux of heat plus the convective flux of heat associated with the conversion from any phase to the reference state were shown to satisfy the onsager reciprocal relations. A theorem due to Meixner was used to delineate the class of fluxes and forces that preserves these relations. In particular, it was shown that if the gradients of water content and temperature are used as the driving forces, the onsager relations are no longer satisfied.","","","Agricultural Research Service, Riverside, CA","","","United States","1975-12-01T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: Water Resour.

Nearly 10 times that resource either remains to be discovered or awaits improved technology for its exploitation. Main interest at present is in geothermal deposits in which heat is transferred by hydrothermal convection. As with mineral resources, much geothermal heat seems to concentrate in a few large deposits, with some particularly outstanding areas located in California, New Mexico, and the Bruneau--Grandview area of Idaho.

The values in water for the octahydrate decrease from 0.033 m at 25/sup 0/C to 8 x 10/sup 6/ m for a lower hydrate at 350/sup 0/C. Assumptions of several sets of ionic species saturating the sulfuric acid solutions have been tested by extended Debye--Hueckel theory, which suggests that the 3 to 2 samarium sulfate may behave predominantly as a 2 to 2 sulfate at high temperatures, thus producing Sm/sub 2/(SO/sub 4/)/sub 2//sup 2 +/ and SO/sub 4//sup 2 -/ ions in solution.

The motivation for interest in advanced power systems stems primarily from the rapidly rising costs of clean fossil fuels, especially conventional fuel oil, and uncertainties of fuel supply. Four basic energy sources have been identified for prospective future American utility applications; namely, coal, nuclear, solar, and geothermal. Each source must generally be subjected to extensive preprocessing before thermal energy can be delivered in a form useful to an electric power conversion system. Numerous candidate advanced energy conversion systems can be matched to the various energy sources, including steam, open-cycle gas turbines, combined cycles, closed-cycle gas turbines, MHD, fuel cells, liquid metal topping, supercritical carbon dioxide topping, and others. Each has advantages and disadvantages which can be ranked and weighted numerically, based on present knowledge. A tentative selection of promising combinations of energy sources and conversion systems has been made to focus attention on those which satisfy the socio-political requirements and also offer potential profit opportunities for suppliers to the electric utility industry.

The current field is then studied by making measurements of electric field intensity with dipole receivers at many locations around the bipole source. The values for electric field intensity may be used to compute apparent resistivities if we assume that the earth is uniform or to compute apparent conductance if we assume that the earth resembles a conducting sheet. Maps of apparent resistivity values or apparent conductance values may be interpreted by comparing them with similar maps computed analytically for various simplified earth models. The bipole-dipole mapping method is useful mainly in locating areas where ground resistivity varies rapidly in the horizontal direction.

The four profiles across the Kuril arc are similar and differ from the profile extending off southern Kamchatka. The contributions to gravity anomalies from the crust and mantle were investigated by means of continuous seismic refraction measurements along tracks coincident with the gravity profiles. The mantle gravity anomalies computed from various density models are positive over the island arc, trench, and adjacent Pacific basin and amount to at least +50 mGal. Gravity anomalies due to the mantle suggest the existence of a denser slab 50 to 60 km thick parallel to the seismic zone. The positive gravity effect of the slab appears to be balanced over the Okhotsk basin by the negative effect of the heated, less dense mantle. The local minimum of Bouguer anomalies occurring over the shoreward flank of the Kuril trench is rather insensitive to the density contrast adopted. The sediments measured seismically account for this Bouguer minimum. The gravity field over the Kuril and Tonga ridges supports the idea of reduced density under the volcanic chain. The local minimum of gravity anomalies associated with the northwestern boundary of the Okhotsk basin is probably related to the fault separating the Academy of Sciences rise from the basin. The ocean-to-continent trend of the free-air anomalies in the Kuril area is unlike that in Tonga, which might be related to features of heat flow anomalies in the Kurils.","","","Inst. of Physics of the Earth, Moscow","","","United States","1975-04-10T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: J.

The atmospheric compositions of gases compatible with pyrrhotite-magnetite assemblages crystallized from immiscible sulfide liquids at Alae Crater, Hawaii were determined. At 800/sup 0/, 1 atm total pressure, the allowed range of gas compositions for these assemblages includes abundant C and S and excludes compositions dominated by H/sub 2/O. SO/sub 2/ is more abundant that H/sub 2/S, and, at C/S ratio 1.5, the molar composition is like that derived for the ''initial'' gas at Kilauea (B. E. Nordlie, 1971). At 900/sup 0/, 1 atm total pressure, only gases with anomalously low C/S ratios are allowed. The allowed range of gases compatible with oxide-sulfide assemblages at higher pressures includes more water-rich compositions.

Natural mordenite tuff and mordenite-opal tuff of Miocene age were subjected to alteration in Na/sub 2/CO/sub 3/ solution (1 molar; 0.25 molar) at 100 to 300/sup 0/C and 30 to 110 kg/cm/sup 2/ for 2 to 20 days using a test-tube-type reactor. After treatment at 150 to 200/sup 0/C, analcime (NaAlSi/sub 2/O/sub 6/ . H/sub 2/O) was formed as an alteration product. At 300/sup 0/C, most of the analcime was decomposed with the elapse of time. In the dilute solution at 300/sup 0/C, analcime was secondarily altered to albite. Albite formed more readily in the mordenite-opal tuff (high-silica tuff) than in the mordenite tuff. Both tuffs showed no remarkable changes when treated at 200/sup 0/C in NaCl solution and artificial seawater environments. Even though treated in Na-bearing reaction solution, they did not always produce analcime. It is possible to estimate from the present experiments that the alkalinity of the reaction solution is a significant controlling factor in analcimization, and the possible formation temperature of the analcime zone cannot exceed 200/sup 0/C. It also appears probable that the analcime zone around Kuroko-type mineral deposits is formed by the interaction of an alkaline interstitial solution and the precursor zeolite-bearing acidic pyroclastic rocks. These interstitial solutions might have been heated by submarine volcanism and/or exhalative activities which accelerated analcimization.

Nonterrestrial planetary studies, conducted at fairly coarse resolution, have been useful primarily in determining the distribution of rock fragments. Terrestrial studies, conducted from satellite and aircraft at coarse to fine resolutions, have been successful for monitoring effusive volcanism, delineating areas of steaming altered ground and hot-spring activity, detecting fractures expressed hydrologically and topographically, and distinguishing a variety of geologic materials with physical and compositional differences. Interpretation of thermal images is complicated by the various types of physical processes involved and commonly requires an assessment of many different factors. A simple theoretical model was used in this analysis to provide quantitative assessment of some of these factors, to predict optimum times to acquire thermal data, and to determine quantitative values of various properties of terrain. Two geologic applications were studied in some detail: geothermal mapping and thermal inertia mapping. Initial results indicate that both techniques have considerable potential, especially in reconnaissance studies. These data were acquired under optimal meteorological conditions and at sites where the geologic materials were well exposed. A realistic assessment of the limitations of these techniques must await future studies.","","","Dept. of the Interior, Denver","","","United States","1975-01-01T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: Proc.

Accordingly, all geothermal steam producers are now entitled to deduct as current expense the intangible costs of developing and drilling geothermal steam wells and all producers who can demonstrate that their geothermal steam resource is depletable are entitled to what is now a 22 percent depletion allowance. The key expert witness in the case was Dr. Henry J. Ramey, Jr. and a summary is presented of his monograph which was submitted as evidence. His conclusion, based on a reservoir engineering analysis, was that the geothermal resource at the Big Geysers area had, as of 1968, 20 to 46 years of productive life remaining. In the economics discussion, it is demonstrated that the corporate income tax discriminates against risky and capital-intensive industries such as oil and gas and geothermal. The central economic argument in favor of percentage depletion allowances and expensing privileges is that these provisions remove the discriminatory bias of corporate income taxes. The economic consequences of depletion allowances are: a short- and long-run increase in production; a short- and long-run increase in investment in renewal--exploration, discovery, and development; lower prices; a ratio of reserves to output--the Life Index--which tends to be constant; and a short-run increase in profits which encourages the entry of new firms and a long-run situation in which average rates of return are again equalized across industries.","","","Univ. of Hawaii, Honolulu","","","United States","1975-01-01T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: Geothermics; (United States); Journal Volume: 4:1-4","","Medium: X; Size: Pages: 66-75","","","","Journal ID: CODEN: GTMCA","10.1016/0375-6505(75)90010-3","","2016-05-06T00:00:00Z","7343854","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/7343854","","Geothermics; (United States)","","4:1-4"

Recent investigations and tests were planned to develop a routine and economic scaling control method for the majority of thermal water wells. The most appropriate method seems to be, according to the results of various tests and experiments, periodical acid treatment under operating conditions which ensure the continuous flow of thermal water wells liable to scaling. Acid treatment can be carried out by the well-operators themselves, at reduced costs, with simple equipment. This work can also be done at the same time by a service company, according to an acid treatment schedule. Acid treatment has the advantage of being an inexpensive operation of only a few hours duration. The necessity and importance of this type of acid treatment in thermal water wells combined with the hydrodynamic surveys should be emphasized. It is supported by the direct relationship between the chemical composition of the thermal waters and their tendency to scaling. On the basis of preliminary investigations, taking into account the local conditions and circumstances, the use of other control methods treated in this study must not be eliminated if it seems more simple and effective in particular conditions.","","","Research Institute for the Development of Water Resources, Budapest","","","United States","1975-01-01T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: Geothermics; (United States); Journal Volume: 4:1-4","","Medium: X; Size: Pages: 57-65","","","","Journal ID: CODEN: GTMCA","10.1016/0375-6505(75)90009-7","","2016-05-13T00:00:00Z","7346212","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/7346212","","Geothermics; (United States)","","4:1-4"

A heat flow of 2.0 to 3.4 ..mu..cal/cm/sup 2/s gives temperature gradients between 45 and 70/sup 0/C/km in the basin. At 2000 m depth the virgin rock temperature is between 110 and 150/sup 0/C. 80 geothermal wells about 2000 m deep have shown the great geothermal potential of the basin. The main hot water reservoir is the Upper Pliocene (Pannonian) sandstone formation. Between a 100-300 m interval, 3 to 8 permeable layers are exploited resulting in 1-3 m/sup 3//min hot water at 80-99/sup 0/C temperature. Wells at present are overflowing with shut-in pressures of 3-5 atm. The assessment of geothermal resources revealed that the content of the water-bearing rocks down to 3000 m amounts to 12,600 x 10/sup 18/ cal. In the Tertiary sediments 10,560 x 10/sup 18/ cal and in the Upper Pannonian, 1938 x 10/sup 18/ cal are stored. In the Upper Pannonian geothermal reservoir, below 1000 m, where the virgin rock temperature is between 70 and 140/sup 0/C, the stored heat is 768 x 10/sup 18/ cal. The amount of recoverable geothermal energy from 768 x 10/sup 18/ cal is 7.42 x 10/sup 18/ cal, i.e., about 10,000 MW century, not considering reinjection. At present the Pannonian geothermal reservoir stores the greatest amount of identified heat which can be mobilized and used. Hungary has 496 geothermal wells with a nominal capacity of 428 m/sup 3//min, producing 1342 MW heat. 147 wells have an outflow temperature of more than 60/sup 0/C producing 190 m/sup 3//min, that is, 845 MW.

This hole, identified as ''GT-1'', penetrated about 143 m (470 ft) into the granitic Precambrian rock. Bottomhole temperature was 100.4/sup 0/C. Hydraulic fracturing was accomplished repeatedly in the granitic section of the hole at pumping pressures of the order of 10.3 MPa (1500 psi). The fractures appeared to be essentially vertical and to have a consistent northwest-southeast orientation. The fractures could be held open by pumping pressures of the order of 6.9 MPa (1000 psi), and at such pressures the rate of fluid loss from the system was very low. It was concluded that the basement rock penetrated by GT-1 was well suited to creation and containment of a pressurized-water energy-extraction loop. A second deep exploratory hole, GT-2, has been drilled to a present depth of 2042 m (6701 ft). It is located on top of Fenton Hill, a flat-topped mesa about 2.5 km (1.5 miles) south of GT-1. It is being used primarily to investigate the structure, temperature, permeability, and fracturing behavior of the Precambrian basement rock at a second location and at greater depth than was reached in GT-1.

At above approximately 180/sup 0/, the solubility of quartz governs the amount of dissolved SiO/sub 2/ in the water. The factors that determine with which of these SiO/sub 2/ minerals the dissolved SiO/sub 2/ may reach equilibrium in this temperature range were not shown. Equilibrium with chalcedony appears in some instances to be established at 20/sup 0/, but most commonly cold ground water is SiO/sub 2/ supersaturated with respect to chalcedony solubility. Provided SiO/sub 2/ is the only varying component in the system, SiO/sub 2/ temperatures are minimum temperatures and represent temperatures of last equilibrium with quartz or chalcedony. If mixing with cold ground water takes place and an originally high pH of the thermal water is lowered, the estimated SiO/sub 2/ temperatures are likely to be high compared with the temperature of the mixture.

Two of these heat flow measurements were combined with the determinations of heat generation due to the radioactive decay. The heat flow values fit the general geothermal pattern of Czechoslovakia (Cermak 1968), of clearly sustained low heat flow in the stable parts of the Bohemian massif and increased heat flow in Krusne Hory mountains. The linear relationship between heat flow Q and heat generation A, Q = q/sub 0/ + bA, revealed preliminary values of b = 3.8 km and q/sub 0/ = 1.05 x 10/sup -6/ cal/(cm/sup 2/s), which may be of physical meaning for the uppermost crustal structure. However, such a low value of b does not seem to be adequate for deep extrapolation of surface heat flow observations and for the calculation of crustal temperature distribution. Characteristic deep temperatures of individual tectonic sub-units of the Bohemian massif were calculated using the ''two-layers step model'' of the crust formed by granitic and basaltic layers. The Moho temperature and the upper mantle heat flow contribution are increasing from 500-550 to 650-700/sup 0/C and from 0.50-0.55 to 0.60-0.65 x 10/sup -6/ cal/(cm/sup 2/s) respectively, beneath the most stable central part northward beneath the northern tectonically rejuvenated region of the Krusne Hory mountains.","","","Geophysical Inst., Prague","","","United States","1975-01-01T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: Geothermics; (United States); Journal Volume: 4:1-4","","Medium: X; Size: Pages: 19-26","","","","Journal ID: CODEN: GTMCA","10.1016/0375-6505(75)90005-X","","2016-05-04T00:00:00Z","7333080","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/7333080","","Geothermics; (United States)","","4:1-4"

Washing with 0.1N HF, water, and saturated boric acid in the new procedure removed fluorates that precipitate during the H/sub 2/SiF/sub 6/ treatment. Failure to remove the fluorates depressed the oxygen yield (to as much as 85 percent) of theoretical SiO/sub 2/ and slightly raised the quartz weight percent, but the oxygen isotopic ratio of quartz derived from various sources was not affected by these washings, by Na/sub 2/S/sub 2/O/sub 7/ fusion, or by H/sub 2/SiF/sub 6/ treatment. When 35 to 45 percent of the outer shells of the 1--3.5, 3.5--7, and 7--10 ..mu..m quartz size fractions from Cretaceous (Pierre) marine shales was dissolved with 3N HF, the quartz delta/sup 18/O decreased by 0.8, 2.1, and 2.6 /sup 0///sub 00/ for a central-basin shale and 0.7, 1.2, and 0.8 /sup 0///sub 00/ for a near-shore shale, respectively. The trend, the greater the particle size the greater the delta/sup 18/O decrease, is the opposite of that expected (finer particles, higher specific surface) if the delta/sup 18/O decrease by HF treatment is a result of dissolving an isotopically exchanged portion and/or overgrowths in outer shells. The decrease appeared by scanning electron microscopy (SEM) to result from preferential dissolution of the cements holding fine quartz crystals (formed at low temperature) together as silt-size clusters. A systematic increase in delta/sup 18/O with decreasing grain size occurred in the quartz from the near-shore shale.","","","","","","United States","1975-01-01T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: Soil Sci.
