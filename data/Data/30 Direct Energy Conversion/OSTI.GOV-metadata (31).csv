While commercial systems, notably fuel cells, have traditionally relied on proton-exchange membranes, hydroxide-ion conducting AAEMs hold promise as a method to reduce cost-per-device by enabling the use of non-platinum group electrodes and cell components. AAEMs have undergone significant material development over the past two decades; however, challenges remain in the areas of durability, water management, high temperature performance, and selectivity. In this review, we survey crosslinking as a tool capable of tuning AAEM properties. While crosslinking implementations vary, they generally result in reduced water uptake and increased transport selectivity and alkaline stability. We survey synthetic methodologies for incorporating crosslinks during AAEM fabrication and highlight necessary precautions for each approach.","MDPI AG","","Lawrence Livermore National Lab.

"Control of nanoparticle dispersion, SEI composition, and electrode morphology enables long cycle life in high silicon content nanoparticle-based composite anodes for lithium-ion batteries","Schulze, Maxwell C.; Urias, Fernando; Dutta, Nikita S.; Huey, Zoey; Coyle, Jaclyn; Teeter, Glenn; Doeren, Ryan; Tremolet de Villers, Bertrand J.; Han, Sang-Don; Neale, Nathan R.; Carroll, G. Michael","30 DIRECT ENERGY CONVERSION; 25 ENERGY STORAGE; anode; battery; electrochemical energy storage; lithium ion battery; silicon","Striking a balance between high theoretical capacity, earth abundance, and compatibility with existing manufacturing infrastructure, silicon is one of the few materials that meet the requirements for a next-generation anode for rechargeable lithium-ion batteries. Due to complications with extreme volume changes during charging/discharging and reactive interfacial chemistries, the cycle life of silicon-based composite anodes is unacceptable for broad use. Developing a majority silicon composite anode formulation that overcomes these challenges and is compatible with current industrial manufacturing practices requires materials and chemical engineering solutions that account for both electrode morphology and interfacial chemistry. Here, we synthesize surface-functionalized silicon nanocrystals that enable a highly dispersed and homogeneous slurry that can easily be integrated into a standard electrode fabrication process. We use this formulation to fabricate a 76 wt% silicon composite electrode. We show that the contents and the morphology of the silicon electrolyte interphase – a determining factor for the cycle life of silicon-based anodes – can be controlled with a post-synthetic thermal curing procedure. The curing process removes the organic surface functional groups used initially to enable dispersion in the slurry. Removing the organic surface coating reduces the cell impedance, improves the silicon utilization for lithium storage, and boosts the coulombic efficiency to values > 99.9% when electrochemically cycled. When paired with a capacity-matched lithium nickel manganese cobalt oxide LiNi<sub>0.8</sub>Mn<sub>0.1</sub>Co<sub>0.1</sub>O<sub>2</sub> cathode, the cell retains 72% of its capacity after 1000 charge/discharge cycles while delivering an initial anode specific capacity of nearly 1000 mA h g<sup>-1</sup> and an areal capacity of 2.55 mA h cm<sup>-2</sup>.","Royal Society of Chemistry (RSC)","","National Renewable Energy Lab.

This effect is investigated computationally and experimentally in the present work. A chemical kinetic analysis revealed that the reaction between NH radical and CO<sub>2</sub> plays an important role in determining the rate of NO<sub>x</sub> formation at these conditions. It was also found that a significant reduction in the NO<sub>x</sub> formation from ammonia oxidation occurs with sCO<sub>2</sub> oxy-combustion at 300 atm when compared to traditional gas turbine conditions. A chemical reactor network simulation of realistic sCO<sub>2</sub> cycle conditions confirmed the reduced NO<sub>x</sub> emissions. Monte Carlo simulations used to study the sensitivity of model input variables on the emissions showed that CO<sub>2</sub> cooling impacts the CO emissions while most of the NO<sub>x</sub> are generated in the flame zone. Uncertainty analysis showed that the reaction between NH and CO<sub>2</sub> to form HNO radical is an important contributor to the model uncertainty under sCO<sub>2</sub> oxy-combustion conditions. The presence of combustion-generated NO<sub>x</sub> in the recycled-CO<sub>2</sub> can impact the fuel oxidation in the primary zone of the combustor. Hence, to understand the effect of NO<sub>x</sub> on ignition, high-pressure shock tube ignition delay time experiments were performed at conditions relevant to sCO<sub>2</sub> oxy-combustion. The ignition delay time measurements were made for syngas and CH<sub>4</sub> fuels with and without NO addition under supercritical conditions using CO<sub>2</sub> as the bulk diluent at nominal pressures around 100 atm. Experimental data showed that the presence of NO promotes ignition at these conditions. The effect is more pronounced for CH<sub>4</sub> compared to syngas. Nitric oxide acts as a chemical catalyst to promote ignition by increasing the combustion radical pool. The catalytic cycle involves the conversion of NO to NO<sub>2</sub> which also contributes to CH<sub>4</sub> oxidation by H-atom abstraction to generate CH<sub>3</sub> radical.","Elsevier","","Combustion Science & Engineering, Inc., Columbia, MD (United States)","USDOE Office of Science (SC), Engineering & Technology.

"Impact of automated battery sorting for mineral recovery from lithium-ion battery recycling in the United States","Weigl, Dustin; Young, David","30 DIRECT ENERGY CONVERSION; 25 ENERGY STORAGE; battery recycling; battery sorting; electric vehicles; lithium-ion batteries; system dynamics","The United States has identified several lithium-ion battery materials as critical for reaching the national emission reduction targets that have been set in accordance with the 2015 Paris Agreement. However, with few natural resources available domestically, there is a rapidly growing focus on the development of a domestic recycling industry to recover these materials from end-of-life batteries. Here, we use the Lithium-Ion Battery Resources Assessment (LIBRA) system dynamics model to evaluate the impact of automated battery sorting technology in terms of the shares of cobalt and nickel that are recovered through recycling. Findings show that automated sorting has clear benefits over manual sorting methods by helping recyclers selectively process high-cobalt batteries. By maximizing cobalt recovery, recycling becomes more profitable and drives greater investment in recycling capacity, resulting in a higher share of nickel and cobalt recovered from EOL batteries over time.","Elsevier","","National Renewable Energy Lab.

This work details the reaction mechanisms of this polymerization by characterizing a red-shift in its absorption spectrum as polymer conjugation length increases and verifies that this optical shift results from extended p-condensation using density functional theory. This new synthetic approach provides a polymer that can potentially be depolymerized for facile recyclability and is compatible with air- and water-sensitive chemistries. As an example of the utility of this new approach, this work demonstrates that this polymer can be directly grown on silicon nanoparticles to create silicon anodes for lithium-ion batteries with a high degree of electrochemical interfacial passivation. These silicon anodes exhibit Coulombic efficiencies above 99.9% and can accommodate silicon nanoparticle expansion and contraction during lithiation and delithiation as demonstrated by stable reversible capacities for 500 cycles. Finally, this work demonstrates that polyPMI facilitates the formation of a lithium fluoride rich solid electrolyte interphase that remains chemically and mechanically stable after long term cycling.","Wiley Blackwell (John Wiley & Sons)","","National Renewable Energy Lab.

However, synthetic fertilizers are made up of several macronutrients (nitrogen, phosphorus, and potassium), each with different energy intensities and environmental impacts. With the movement toward resource circularity, there is a need to create a more holistic view regarding the process energy associated with synthetic inorganic fertilizers, including nitrogen and phosphorus. Here, we first describe the growing production and consumption of inorganic (synthetic) and organic (animal waste) nutrients in agriculture as well as the process energy associated with the production of granular phosphorus and nitrogen-based fertilizers. Next, we present a projected global demand of nitrogen and phosphorus consumption based on various sustainability and societal equity scenarios to make an argument for the viability of nutrient recovery in addition to nutrient synthesis to meet this demand. Finally, we discuss the characteristics and challenges of emerging technologies for nutrient recovery along with a baseline of current operational recovery facilities.","American Chemical Society","","Ohio Univ., Athens, OH (United States)","USDOE Office of Energy Efficiency and Renewable Energy (EERE); Center for Advancing Sustainable and Distributed Fertilizer Production (CASFER)","","United States","2023-02-17T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: ACS Energy Letters Journal Volume: 8 Journal Issue: 3","","Medium: X; Size: p. 1493-1501","","","EE0009502; EEC-2133576","Journal ID: ISSN 2380-8195","10.1021/acsenergylett.2c02627","","2023-03-14T00:00:00Z","1957677","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/1957677","","ACS Energy Letters","3","8"

"Optimized purification methods for metallic contaminant removal from directly recycled Li-ion battery cathodes","Fink, Kae; Gasper, Paul; Major, Joshua; Brow, Ryan; Schulze, Maxwell C.; Colclasure, Andrew M.; Keyser, Matthew A.","25 ENERGY STORAGE; 30 DIRECT ENERGY CONVERSION; black mass; metallic contamination; direct recycling; lithium-ion battery recycling; purification","<p> Metallic contaminants pose a significant challenge to the viability of directly recycling Li-ion batteries. To date, few strategies exist to selectively remove metallic impurities from mixtures of shredded end-of-life material (black mass; BM) without concurrently damaging the structure and electrochemical performance of the target active material. We herein present tailored methods to selectively ionize two major contaminants—Al and Cu—while retaining a representative cathode (LiNi <sub>0.33</sub> Mn <sub>0.33</sub> Co <sub>0.33</sub> O <sub>2</sub> ; NMC-111) intact. This BM purification process is conducted at moderate temperatures in a KOH-based solution matrix. We rationally evaluate approaches to increase both the kinetic corrosion rate and the thermodynamic solubility of Al <sup>0</sup> and Cu <sup>0</sup> , and evaluate the impact of these treatment conditions on the structure, chemistry, and electrochemical performance of NMC. Specifically, we explore the impacts of chloride-based salts, a strong chelating agent, elevated temperature, and sonication on the rate and extent of contaminant corrosion, while concurrently evaluating the effects on NMC. The reported BM purification process is then demonstrated on samples of “simulated BM” containing a practically relevant 1 wt% concentration of Al or Cu. Increasing the kinetic energy of the purifying solution matrix through elevated temperature and sonication accelerates the corrosion of metallic Al and Cu, such that ∼100% corrosion of 75 μm Al and Cu particles is achieved within 2.5 hr. Further, we determine that effective mass transport of ionized species critically impacts the efficacy of Cu corrosion, and that saturated Cl <sup>–</sup> hinders rather than accelerates Cu corrosion by increasing solution viscosity and introducing competitive pathways for Cu surface passivation. The purification conditions do not induce bulk structural damage to NMC, and electrochemical capacity is maintained in half-cell format. Testing in full cells suggests that a limited quantity of residual surface species are present after treatment, which initially disrupt electrochemical behavior at the graphite anode but are subsequently consumed. Process demonstration on simulated BM suggests that contaminated samples—which prior to treatment show catastrophic electrochemical performance—can be recovered to pristine electrochemical capacity. The reported BM purification method offers a compelling and commercially viable solution to address contamination, particularly in the “fine” fraction of BM where contaminant sizes are on the same order of magnitude as NMC and where traditional separation approaches are unfeasible. Thus, this optimized BM purification technique offers a pathway towards viable direct recycling of BM feedstocks that would otherwise be unusable. </p>","Frontiers Media SA","","National Renewable Energy Lab.

One potential solution is the implementation of deep learning methods to detect unwanted defects through their detection in scanned images. Here we explore the detection of defects like scratches, pinholes, and scuffs in a sample dataset of PEM optical images using two deep learning algorithms: Patch Distribution Modeling (PaDiM) for unsupervised anomaly detection and Faster-RCNN for supervised object detection. Both methods achieve scores on performance metrics (ROC-AUC and PRO-AUC for PaDiM and AP for Faster-RCNN) that are comparable to their scores on benchmark datasets. These methods also have the potential to detect a wider range of defects compared to IR thermography and previous optical inspection methods. Overall, deep learning shows promise at detecting relevant defects of interest and has the potential to achieve real-time defect detection.","Elsevier","","National Renewable Energy Lab.

Herein, we investigate the effect of anolyte on the electrode properties such as catalyst utilization, ionic accessibility etc. of a CO<sub>2</sub> reduction cathode using electrochemical techniques and cell configurations that avoid the complexities related to co-electrolysis. Using 1M KOH as the anolyte and a Cu gas-diffusion-electrode with low Nafion content as the model CO<sub>2</sub> reduction electrode, we find that electrode capacitance (proxy for electrochemically active surface area) and ionic conductivity inside the cathode increase approximately 4 and 447 times, respectively, in presence of KOH. Liquid anolyte wets the electrode’s pore structure more efficiently than capillary condensation of feed water vapor. The ionomer coverage is very low, and its distribution inside the electrode is highly fragmented. Surface ion conduction mechanisms inside the electrode are orders of magnitude lower than the bulk ion conduction in presence of anolyte. This study shows that when an anolyte (e.g., KOH) is used, catalyst utilization and ionic accessibility inside the electrode increase significantly.","IOP Publishing","","National Renewable Energy Lab.

However, their efficacy is linked to the presence, identity, and integrity of native surface oxides, which are structurally and chemically complex and evolve during operation. Using ambient pressure X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (APXPS) coupled with ab initio simulations, we track key chemical motifs expressed during evolution of GaP(111) surface oxides, their associated reaction kinetics, and their correlations with electronic properties. We identify two distinct thermal regimes corresponding to kinetically and thermodynamically controlled oxidation. Below 600 K, exposure to O2 generates kinetically facile Ga-O-Ga configurations, whereas higher temperatures cause activated oxygen to insert into Ga–P bonds as part of a thermodynamically driven transformation into a complex, heterogeneous 3D network of surface POx (1≤x ≤ 4) groups and Ga2O3 species, the latter of which eventually dominates upon depletion of surface phosphorus. Here our study highlights the critical competition between kinetic and thermodynamic factors during GaP oxidation, yielding insights for fabricating stable III-P-based photoelectrodes with precisely engineered surface properties.","Elsevier","External Audience (Unlimited)","Lawrence Livermore National Lab.

This work presents particle-in-cell simulations of these converters, using a direct simulation Monte Carlo collision model to track 52 excited states of Cs. Here, these simulations show the dominant role of multi-step ionization, which also varies significantly based on both the applied voltage bias and pressure. The electron energy distribution functions are shown to be highly non-Maxwellian in the cases analyzed here. A comparison with previous approaches is presented, and large differences are found in ionization rates due especially to the fact that previous approaches have assumed Maxwellian electron distributions. Finally, an open question regarding the nature of the plasma sheaths in the obstructed regime is discussed. The one-dimensional simulations did not produce stable obstructed regime operation and thereby do not support the double-sheath hypothesis.","American Institute of Physics (AIP)","","Sandia National Lab.

However, several degradation mechanisms limit the electrochemical performance of current SOFCs, with cathode degradation due to Cr-poisoning from metal interconnects particularly problematic. The acidity/basicity of binary additives has been found to be a sensitive descriptor of the oxygen exchange kinetics, indicating that acidic Cr-species/basic Ca-species can be expected to deactivate/activate the cathode surface, respectively. Inspired by recent advances, the feasibility of relative acidity as a tool for reviving degraded SOFCs is demonstrated by neutralizing Cr-poisoned SOFCs by subsequent serial infiltration of Ca-species. Furthermore, a model mixed ionic and electronic conducting oxide, Pr<sub>0.1</sub>Ce<sub>0.9</sub>O<sub>2-δ</sub> (PCO), is selected as the cathode material. Area-specific resistances (ASR) of symmetric cells obtained by electrochemical impedance spectroscopy show that Cr-infiltration results in a seven-fold increase in ASR, while subsequent infiltration of Ca-species leads to complete recovery. Performance degradation and recovery are attributed to depressed/enhanced redox properties at the PCO surface, as supported by XPS analysis. Experiments using anode-supported fuel cells show a reduction in peak power density by 26% upon Cr-infiltration, reversed following Ca-infiltration, after which no degradation is observed during subsequent operation for 100 h.","Elsevier","","Massachusetts Inst. of Technology (MIT), Cambridge, MA (United States)","USDOE Office of Fossil Energy (FE); National Research Foundation of Korea Fellowship","","United States","2023-01-06T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: Journal of Power Sources; Journal Volume: 558","","Medium: ED; Size: Article No. 232589","","","FE0031668","Journal ID: ISSN 0378-7753","10.1016/j.jpowsour.2022.232589","","2023-01-16T00:00:00Z","1908560","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/1908560","","Journal of Power Sources","","558"

Fischer–Tropsch (FT) reactors can address this challenge by providing storable, high-value liquid hydrocarbon fuels and feedstocks from syngas generated through reductive CO<sub>2</sub> utilization. FT technology, however, is most cost effective at large-scale, fixed-site plants and does not effectively address the smaller, globally distributed CO<sub>2</sub> point sources. Alternatively, smaller, modular reactors can be composed together to the specific scale of the emission source, yielding a flexible solution that enables more widespread deployment. In these modular reactors, thermal management using a finned cooling insert embedded within the catalyst matrix is critical to maintaining the performance and viability. Thus, in this work, topology optimization is used to determine the cooling insert geometry that maximizes reactor productivity while preventing auto-thermal runaway. Optimal designs are generated for varying number of constituent fins and over a range of maximum operating temperatures. Constraints including minimum feature length-scales and prescribed cooling insert material are imposed on the designs to enhance manufacturability. The impact of design features such as insert tapering and increased length scale hierarchy is automatically revealed by the systematic design framework employed. Here, this approach thus generates novel optimal geometries while automating, accelerating, and enhancing the design process compared to traditional heuristic approaches for cooling insert design in modular FT reactors.","Elsevier","External Audience (Unlimited)","Lawrence Livermore National Lab.

The negative charge was injected into the stack by a plasma charge injection technology. Charge stability was studied by exposing samples to AM1.5 simulation visible light and full-spectrum light at temperatures ranging from 55 to 78 °C for up to 300 h. Charge injection and loss were quantified based on shifts in the flatband voltage of capacitance–voltage curves measured with a mercury probe. The most probable mechanism of charge loss was found to be diffusion of negative charged hydrogen atoms through nitride and bottom oxide. The optimum recipe for each layer of the stack was investigated to minimize the loss of injected charge. The flatband voltage decay of the optimized stack was found to fit a power-law trend, suggesting the dispersive transport of hydrogen atoms with a dispersion parameter of ∼0.06–0.07.

First, we investigated the role of side cooling plates on the thermal runaway propagation mitigation in battery modules (1S3P) and packs (3S3P) by varying the key parameters of the side cooling plates, such as plate thicknesses, thermal contact resistances, and materials. Then, three important factors for passive thermal management systems are identified: (i) thermal mass of side cooling plates, (ii) interfacial thermal contact resistances, and (iii) the effective heat transfer coefficients at exterior surfaces.

The heavy Co and Fe-based transition metal doping in BCFZY4411 ensures adequate electrical conductivity while the multiple oxidation states of Co and Fe assist the electrocatalytic and redox ability. Despite the considerable role of Co and Fe transition metal doping in controlling electrochemical activity, however, the study of alternative BCFZY compositions with varying Co/Fe ratios has not yet been pursued.

In this work, we report the integration of sub-1 μm thick nanoporous gold (npAu) catalyst coatings into a large-area (25 cm<sup>2</sup>) zero-gap electrolyzer. The npAu coatings were prepared by magnetron sputtering (MS) of thin AgAu alloy films on the microporous carbon layer of a gas diffusion layer (GDL) followed by Ag leaching. Compared to MS Au films of the same thickness, npAu catalyst coatings enable higher Faradaic efficiencies and improved catalyst stability for CO<sub>2</sub>-to-CO reduction with Faradaic efficiencies of up to 88% at 100 mA/cm<sup>2</sup>. For a 800 nm npAu coating, the device level energy efficiency for CO<sub>2</sub> to CO conversion reaches 45% (52% for CO + H<sub>2</sub>) at 100 mA/cm<sup>2</sup> with a single pass CO<sub>2</sub> conversion efficiency of ~12%.

Its activity and selectivity are highly facet-dependent. We recently examined the commonly proposed rate-limiting CO hydrogenation step on Cu(111) via embedded correlated wavefunction (ECW) theory and demonstrated that only this higher-level theory yields predictions consistent with potential-dependent experimental kinetics. Here, to understand the differing activities of Cu(111) and Cu(100) in catalyzing CO<sub>2</sub>R, we explore CO hydrogenation on Cu(100) using ECW theory. We predict that the preferred pathway involves the reduction of adsorbed CO (*CO) to *COH via proton-coupled electron transfer (PCET) at working potentials, although *CHO also may form with a kinetically accessible but higher barrier. In contrast, our earlier work on Cu(111) concluded that *COH and *CHO formation via PCET are equally feasible. Furthermore, this work illustrates one possible origin of the facet dependence of CO<sub>2</sub>R mechanisms and products on Cu electrodes and sheds light on how the selectivity of CO<sub>2</sub>R electrocatalysts can be controlled by the surface morphology.","American Chemical Society","","Princeton Plasma Physics Lab.

Foundational to the rational design of efficient, selective CO<sub>2</sub>RR electrocatalysts is mechanistic analysis of the best metal catalyst thus far identified, namely, copper (Cu), via quantum mechanical computations to complement experiments. Here, we apply embedded correlated wavefunction (ECW) theory, which regionally corrects the electron exchange-correlation error in density functional theory (DFT) approximations, to examine multiple C–C coupling steps involving adsorbed CO (*CO) and its hydrogenated derivatives on the most ubiquitous facet, Cu(111). We predict that two adsorbed hydrogenated CO species, either *COH or *CHO, are necessary precursors for C–C bond formation. The three kinetically feasible pathways involving these species yield all three possible products: *COH–CHO, *COH–*COH, and *OCH–*OCH. The most kinetically favorable path forms *COH–CHO. In contrast, standard DFT approximations arrive at qualitatively different conclusions, namely, that only *CO and *COH will prevail on the surface and their C–C coupling paths produce only *COH–*COH and *CO–*CO, with a preference for the first product. Furthermore, this work demonstrates the importance of applying qualitatively and quantitatively accurate quantum mechanical method to simulate electrochemistry in order ultimately to shed light on ways to enhance selectivity toward C<sub>2+</sub> product formation via CO<sub>2</sub>RR electrocatalysts.","Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences","","Princeton Plasma Physics Lab.

In this study, we bonded sintered silver samples and subjected it to a thermal cycling profile of -40 °C to 200 °C with high ramp rates. We periodically monitored samples under thermal cycling to detect the presence of any failure mechanisms using a scanning acoustic microscope. We also included 95Pb5Sn solder in the study to obtain reference data. Results show the occurrence of cracks in sintered silver followed by a rapid rate of crack growth that exceeded the failure criterion in just 50 cycles. The predominant failure mechanism we observed was adhesive failure. As a large-area attachment, solder exhibited a higher reliability than sintered silver but failed within 100 cycles. Finally, we performed thermomechanical modeling to compute strain energy density values and correlated these with the experimentally observed crack growth rates to formulate a lifetime prediction model for sintered silver.","IEEE","","National Renewable Energy Lab.

Membrane degradation reactions are thought to be attacks by radicals such as hydroxyl (HO<sup>•</sup>) or hydrogen atom (H<sup>•</sup>) generated during fuel cell operation. For the H<sup>•</sup> case, computational modeling results have suggested that the reaction between H<sup>•</sup> and the sulfonic group should be the dominant degradation pathway. However, experimental work implies that the tertiary fluorine (t-F) attack is the dominant H<sup>•</sup> reaction pathway, apparently contradicting the theoretical prediction. Based on previous experimental evidence on isotopic substitution, we postulate that the hydronium radical (H<sub>3</sub>O<sup>•</sup>) might be present in PEMFCs. Our ab initio modeling indicates that this radical can be stabilized by the sulfonic anion on the polymer side chain. With the assistance of explicit water, the polymer side chain can undergo a conformational change, leading to a greatly reduced barrier for the t-F degradation reaction. Thus, our H<sub>3</sub>O<sup>•</sup> hypothesis is able to explain not only the previous isotopic substitution experiment but also why the t-F degradation reaction is a highly plausible H<sup>•</sup> degradation mechanism for proton-exchange membranes. To our knowledge, this is the first suggestion that H<sub>3</sub>O<sup>•</sup> radicals could be present in electrochemical devices with both experimental and theoretical support.","American Chemical Society","","National Renewable Energy Lab.

The technology, however, suffers from performance degradation due to cathode poisoning by chromia from metal interconnects. We confirm the deleterious impact of chromia on the performance of the model mixed conducting cathode material Pr<sub>0.1</sub>Ce<sub>0.9</sub>O<sub>2–δ</sub> by examining the oxygen exchange coefficient (kchem) via electrical conductivity relaxation measurements, and the area-specific resistance (ASR) by electrochemical impedance spectroscopy. Liquid Cr-infiltration decreases kchem 20-fold and the oxygen exchange component of ASR increases 20-fold while maintaining the same activation energy. We then demonstrate the ability to not only recover initial kchem and ASR values, but improve properties above those exhibited by the pristine specimen through subsequent Li-infiltration, leading to enhancement of kchem by more than three orders of magnitude and reduction in oxygen exchange component of the ASR by over a factor 100. We attribute these dramatic changes to the depletion of electrons induced by the acidic Cr-infiltrant on the Pr<sub>0.1</sub>Ce<sub>0.9</sub>O<sub>2–δ</sub> surface and the recovery to accumulation of electrons from the basic Li-infiltrant. These results point to acidity as a key descriptor in addressing the long-standing challenge of reactive surface poisoning in applications reliant on rapid oxygen exchange and recovery behavior.

Instead, current-source converters (CSCs) are attracting increasing attention in recent years owing to their friendliness to short-circuit faults, improved EMI, etc. For CSCs, overvoltage is the most catastrophic failure since the semiconductor devices can hardly withstand an overvoltage for a short pulse. In this paper, a fast-response high-accuracy overvoltage protection (OVP) circuit is proposed to protect CSCs from overvoltage damage. It also features a small form factor, good noise-immunity, friendly retrofit capability, and no need for active switches. In this paper, the operating principle and design guideline of the proposed OVP circuit is introduced. Its effectiveness is validated in soft-switching solid-state transformer (S4T) at 500 V.

Conventional thermoelectric generation is driven by the Seebeck effect, discovered by T.J. Seebeck in 1821, in which a charge current J<sub>c</sub> is generated in the direction parallel to a temperature gradient ∇T, the longitudinal geometry. Here, the ratio between the generated longitudinal electromotive force and applied ∇T is defined as the Seebeck coefficient. As shown in Figure 1A, a thermoelectric module based on the Seebeck effect typically consists of many pairs (128 for a 12V unit) of p-type and n-type conductors alternately arranged and connected in series. Since the Seebeck coefficient of a p-type (n-type) conductor is positive (negative), the thermopower in each element adds to the total output in the Seebeck module. This configuration is needed to achieve a practical voltage because each element only supplies millivolts but limits the use of thermoelectric generators. The efficiency of thermoelectric generators is characterized by the thermoelectric figure of merit, zT. Despite a 3-fold improvement in zT resulting from materials research over the last two decades, little progress has been made in their practical use; this is ascribed to the technological challenges in contact technology. The contacts on the hot side are subject to thermal degradation. All contacts (512 for a 12V unit) add electrical and thermal contact resistances that reduce the device efficiency to a fraction of that promised by the materials.","Elsevier - Cell Press","","The Ohio State Univ., Columbus, OH (United States)","USDOE Office of Science (SC), Basic Energy Sciences (BES)","","United States","2022-09-28T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: Joule; Journal Volume: 6; Journal Issue: 10","","Medium: ED; Size: p. 2240-2245","","","SC0020923","Journal ID: ISSN 2542-4351","10.1016/j.joule.2022.08.016","","2023-01-09T00:00:00Z","1907067","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/1907067","","Joule","10","6"

Low-Pt-loaded PEMFCs suffer losses beyond those predicted solely due to reduced catalyst area. Although consensus links these losses to thin ionomer films in the CCL, a precise mechanistic explanation remains elusive. In this publication, we present a physically based PEMFC model with novel structure-property relationships for thin-film Nafion, validated against PEMFC data with low Pt loading. Results suggest that flooding exacerbates kinetic limitations in low-loaded PEMFCs, shifting the Faradaic current distribution. As current density increases, protons travel further into the CCL, resulting in higher Ohmic overpotentials. We also present a parametric study of CCL design parameters. We find that graded Pt and ionomer loadings reduce Ohmic losses and flooding, but individually do not provide significant improvements. However, a dual-graded CCL (i.e., graded Pt <italic>and</italic> ionomer) is predicted to significantly improve the maximum power density and limiting current compared to uniformly loaded CCLs. This work highlights the importance of accurate transport parameters for thin-film Nafion and provides a pathway to low-cost PEMFCs via precise control of CCL microstructures. </p>","The Electrochemical Society","","Colorado School of Mines, Golden, CO (United States)","USDOE; USDOE Office of Science (SC), Basic Energy Sciences (BES).

To date, perovskite-based mixed conducting cathodes, which include inherent Co and Sr elements for enhanced reactivity and conductivity, have been intensively studied. These Co/Sr-based oxides, however, exhibit severe thermochemical expansion and suffer from Sr surface segregation, ultimately degrading the electrode performance. Here, high-performance and durable SOFCs are demonstrated by employing a Co/Sr-free fluorite-based mixed conducting (Pr,Ce)O<sub>2-δ</sub> (PCO) cathode eminently compatible with fluorite-based solid electrolytes. The nanocolumnar PCO electrode developed in this study provides not only a remarkable low level of electrode resistance (e.g., ≈0.05 Ω cm<sup>2</sup> at 600 °C) but also exceptional long-term stability (e.g., a degradation rate 15 times slower compared to the state-of-the-art La<sub>0.6</sub>Sr<sub>0.4</sub>CoO<sub>3-δ</sub> perovskite). The competitive peak power densities of an anode-supported single cell with the PCO cathode are also successively achieved, recording a value of 0.92 W cm<sup>–2</sup> at 600 °C. These findings herald the development of new Co/Sr-free electrodes for SOFCs at intermediate temperatures.","Wiley Blackwell (John Wiley & Sons)","","Massachusetts Inst. of Technology (MIT), Cambridge, MA (United States); National Energy Technology Laboratory (NETL), Pittsburgh, PA, Morgantown, WV, and Albany, OR (United States)","USDOE Office of Fossil Energy (FE); National Research Foundation of Korea (NRF); Korea Institute of Energy Technology Evaluation and Planning (KETEP)","","Germany","2022-09-08T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: Advanced Energy Materials Journal Volume: 12 Journal Issue: 43","","Medium: X; Size: Article No. 2202101","","","FE0031668; 2021M3H4A1A01002695; 20213030030040","Journal ID: ISSN 1614-6832","10.1002/aenm.202202101","","2022-11-18T00:00:00Z","1894722","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/1894722","","Advanced Energy Materials","43","12"

The operating conditions of a direct-fired sCO<sub>2</sub> cycle and thermophysical properties of the fluid at those conditions can alter the flow field characteristics of the coolant jet and its mixing with the mainstream. Very little information is present in the literature regarding the performance of film cooling geometries employing supercritical CO<sub>2</sub>. The objective of this study is to estimate the resulting film cooling effectiveness while also capturing the effects of the crossflow-to-mainstream velocity ratio on the coolant jet. Herein, a computational fluid dynamic model is used to study the coolant jet exiting a cylindrical hole located on a flat plate, with the coolant fed by an internal channel. Steady-state Reynolds-averaged Navier–Stokes equations were solved along with the (shear-stress transport) SST k–ω model to provide the turbulence closure. The operating conditions for the direct-fired sCO<sub>2</sub> turbine are obtained using an in-house Cooled Turbine Model. Numerical predictions revealed that the crossflow effects and jet lift-off were more pronounced in the case of sCO<sub>2</sub> when compared to air.

Identifying models with high accuracy and low uncertainty is crucial for ensuring that model extrapolations are believable, however, it is difficult to compose expressions that accurately predict multivariate data trends; a review of cycling degradation models from literature reveals a wide variety of functional relationships. Here, a machine-learning assisted model identification method is utilized to fit degradation in a stand-out LFP-Gr aging data set, with uncertainty quantified by bootstrap resampling. The model identified in this work results in approximately half the mean absolute error of a human expert model. Models are validated by converting to a state-equation form and comparing predictions against cells aging under varying loads. Parameter uncertainty is carried forward into an energy storage system simulation to estimate the impact of aging model uncertainty on system lifetime. The new model identification method used here reduces life-prediction uncertainty by more than a factor of three (86% ± 5% relative capacity at 10 years for human-expert model, 88.5% ± 1.5% for machine-learning assisted model), empowering more confident estimates of energy storage system lifetime.","IOP Publishing","","National Renewable Energy Lab.

The performance of conventional perovskite-based anode materials for ethane conversion in PCECs is limited by their low active surface area and proneness to coke deposition. In this work, for the first time, we demonstrate the use of aligned carbon nanotube forests (CNTFs) as a novel anode material for an ethane fueled PCEC to co-produce ethylene and electricity. The CNTF electrode was grown on the electrolyte by the chemical vapor deposition (CVD) method. Highly dispersed iron carbide nanoparticles are formed in situ on the CNTFs during the CVD process, acting as highly active catalysts for ethane dehydrogenation. The novel PCECs show superior catalytic and electrochemical performances to that using conventional perovskite-based anodes. The cell also exhibits excellent durability and anti-coking abilities within 100 h test.

The CLs are heterogeneous structures, often with uneven ion-conducting polymer (ionomer) coverage and underutilized catalysts. Various platinum-supported-on-carbon colloidal catalyst particles are used, but little is known about how or why changing the primary particle loading (PPL, or the weight fraction of platinum of the carbon-platinum catalyst particles) impacts performance. Here, by investigating the CL gas-transport resistance and zeta-potentials of the corresponding inks as a function of PPL, a direct correlation between the CL high current density performance and ink zeta-potential is observed. This correlation stems from likely changes in ionomer distributions and catalyst-particle agglomeration as a function of PPL, as revealed by pH, zeta-potential, and impedance measurements. These findings are critical to unraveling the ionomer distribution heterogeneity in ink-based CLs and enabling enhanced Pt utilization and improved device performance for fuel cells and related electrochemical devices.","American Chemical Society (ACS)","","National Renewable Energy Lab.

In these two stage approaches, the AC-DC stage is hard-switched, whereas the DC-DC stage is soft-switched. Therefore, the devices in the AC-DC stage can be switched only at tens of kHz to avoid excessive switching losses, thus limiting the bandwidth of the current control loop. Hence, the control of these converters with distorted grid voltages requires multiple harmonic compensation loops or other complex control algorithms in order for the grid currents to comply with IEEE standards. By integrating both the stages, the devices in the AC-DC stage can also be soft-switched, thus facilitating higher switching frequency, and thereby higher current control bandwidth. This paper proposes an integrated multilevel bidirectional AC-DC converter with improved control bandwidth and disturbance rejection. It is shown experimentally that the high bandwidth current control loop of the converter can reject grid harmonic current disturbances, without the need for any compensation loops or complex control techniques, and comply with IEEE standards.","IEEE","","Mallika Ashwin Maya Corporation, Bridgewater, NJ (United States)","USDOE Office of Science (SC), Engineering & Technology.

Scanning transmission electron microscopy (STEM) has played an important role in nanoparticle characterization, owing to its high spatial resolution, which allows direct visualization of composition and morphology with atomic precision. This typically comes at the cost of sample size, potentially limiting the accuracy and relevance of STEM results, as well as the ability to meaningfully track changes in properties that vary spatially. In this work, automated STEM data acquisition and analysis techniques are employed that enable physical and compositional properties of nanoparticles to be obtained at high resolution over length scales on the order of microns. This is demonstrated by studying the localized effects of potential cycling on electrocatalyst degradation across proton exchange membrane fuel cell cathodes. As opposed to conventional, manual STEM measurements which produce particle size distributions representing hundreds of particles, these high-throughput automated methods capture tens of thousands of particles and enable nanoparticle size, density, and composition to be measured as a function of position within the cathode. Comparing the properties of pristine and degraded fuel cells provides statistically-robust evidence for the inhomogeneous nature of catalyst degradation across electrodes. These results demonstrate how high-throughput automated STEM techniques can be utilized to investigate local phenomena occurring in nanoparticle systems employed in practical devices.","American Chemical Society","","Los Alamos National Lab.

Development of these technologies requires photoelectrode materials that are both photocatalytically active and operationally stable in harsh oxidative and/or reductive electrochemical environments. Such photocatalysts can be discovered based on co-design principles, wherein design for stability is based on the propensity for the photocatalyst to self-passivate under operating conditions and design for photoactivity is based on the ability to integrate the photocatalyst with established semiconductor substrates. Here, we report on the synthesis and characterization of zinc titanium nitride (ZnTiN<sub>2</sub>) that follows these design rules by having a wurtzite-derived crystal structure and showing self-passivating surface oxides created by electrochemical polarization. The sputtered ZnTiN<sub>2</sub> thin films have optical absorption onsets below 2 eV and n-type electrical conduction of 3 S/cm. The band gap of this material is reduced from the 3.36 eV theoretical value by cation-site disorder, and the impact of cation antisites on the band structure of ZnTiN<sub>2</sub> is explored using density functional theory. Under electrochemical polarization, the ZnTiN<sub>2</sub> surfaces have TiO<sub>2</sub>- or ZnO-like character, consistent with Materials Project Pourbaix calculations predicting the formation of stable solid phases under near-neutral pH.

However, these both reduce effective ionic transport in the electrolyte phase and reduce energy density. Therefore, an optimal additive loading is required to maximize performance, especially for fast charging where ionic transport is essential. Such optimization analysis is however challenging due to the nanoscale imaging limitations that prevent characterizing this additive phase and thus quantifying its impact on performance. Herein, an additive-phase generation algorithm has been developed to remedy this limitation and identify percolation threshold used to define a minimal additive loading. Improved ionic transport coefficients from reducing additive loading has been then quantified through homogenization calculation, macroscale model fitting, and experimental symmetric cell measurement, with good agreement between the methods. Rate capability test demonstrates capacity improvement at fast charge at the beginning of life, from 37% to 55%, respectively for high and low additive loading during 6C CC charging, in agreement with macroscale model, and attributed to a combination of lower cathode impedance, reduced electrode tortuosity and cathode thickness.</jats:p>","The Electrochemical Society","","Idaho National Lab.

However, testing methodologies are not standardised across the research community, especially with failure mechanisms being inherently difficult to reproduce. High-speed X-ray radiography is proven to be a valuable tool to capture events occurring during cell failure, but the observations made remain largely qualitative. We have therefore developed a robust image processing toolbox that can quantify, for the first time, the rate of propagation of battery failure mechanisms revealed by high-speed X-ray radiography. Using Gabor filter, the toolbox selectively tracks the electrode structure at the onset of failure. This facilitated the estimation of the displacement of electrodes undergoing abuse via nail penetration, and also the tracking of objects, such as the nail, as it propagates through a cell. Further, by cross-correlating the Gabor signals, we have produced practical, illustrative spatiotemporal maps of the failure events. From these, we can quantify the propagation rates of electrode displacement prior to the onset of thermal runaway. The highest recorded acceleration (≈514 mm s<sup>-2</sup>) was when a nail penetrated a cell radially (perpendicular to the electrodes) as opposed to axially (parallel to the electrodes). The initiation of thermal runaway was also resolved in combination with electrode displacement, which occurred at a lower acceleration (≈108 mm s<sup>-2</sup>). Our assistive toolbox can also be used to study other types of failure mechanisms, extracting otherwise unattainable kinetic data. Ultimately, this tool can be used to not only validate existing theoretical mechanical models, but also standardise battery failure testing procedures.","Royal Society of Chemistry","","National Renewable Energy Lab.

"Yttrium-based Double Perovskite Nanorods for Electrocatalysis","McGuire, Scott C.; Wesley, Weiqiao; Sasaki, Kotaro; Tong, Xiao; Wong, Stanislaus S.","30 DIRECT ENERGY CONVERSION; double perovskites; nanorods; catalysis; supports; electrocatalysis","In this work, we investigate the effect of chemical composition of double perovskite nanorods on their versatile electrocatalytic activity not only as supports for the oxidation of small organic molecules but also as catalysts for the oxygen evolution reaction. Specifically, Y<sub>2</sub>CoMnO<sub>6</sub> and Y<sub>2</sub>NiMnO<sub>6</sub> nanorods with average diameters of 300 nm were prepared by a two-step hydrothermal method, in which the individual effects of synthetic parameters, such as the pH, annealing temperature, and precursor ratios on both the composition and morphology, were systematically investigated. When used as supports for Pt nanoparticles, Y<sub>2</sub>CoMnO<sub>6</sub>/Pt catalysts exhibited an electrocatalytic activity for the methanol oxidation reaction, which is 2.1 and 1.3 times higher than that measured for commercial Pt/C and Y<sub>2</sub>NiMnO<sub>6</sub>/Pt. Similarly, the Co-based catalyst support material displayed an ethanol oxidation activity, which is 2.3 times higher than both Pt/C and Y<sub>2</sub>NiMnO<sub>6</sub>/Pt. This clear enhancement in the activity for Y<sub>2</sub>CoMnO<sub>6</sub> can largely be attributed to strong metal-support interactions, as evidenced by a downshift in the binding energy of the Pt 4f bands, measured by XPS, which is often correlated not only with a downshift in the d-band center but also to a decreased adsorption of poisoning adsorbates. Moreover, when used as catalysts for the oxygen evolution reaction, Y<sub>2</sub>CoMnO<sub>6</sub> displayed a much greater activity as compared with Y<sub>2</sub>NiMnO<sub>6</sub>. This behavior can largely be attributed not only to a preponderance of comparatively more favorable oxidation states and electronic configurations but also to the formation of an active layer on the surface of the Y<sub>2</sub>CoMnO<sub>6</sub> catalyst, which collectively give rise to improved performance metrics and greater stability as compared with both IrO<sub>2</sub> and Y<sub>2</sub>NiMnO<sub>6</sub>. Overall, these results highlight the importance of both the chemical composition and the electronic structure of double perovskites, especially when utilized in multi-functional roles as either supports or catalysts.","American Chemical Society (ACS)","","Brookhaven National Lab.

"Adiabatic and isothermal configurations for Re<sub>4</sub>Si<sub>7</sub> transverse thermoelectric power generators","Scudder, Michael R.; Koster, Karl G.; Heremans, Joseph P.; Goldberger, Joshua E.","30 DIRECT ENERGY CONVERSION; Goniopolar materials; transverse thermoelectric materials","<p> Transverse thermoelectric generators (TTEGs) have the potential to overcome two challenging problems that limit the commercial application of classical thermoelectric generators (TEGs): the significant irreversible efficiency losses in the contacts and the thermal degradation of the contacts at the hot end. TTEGs are built from a single material that can generate a thermoelectric current in a direction that is orthogonal to a temperature gradient. They only require a single set of contacts that are displaced away from the hot end. Here, we experimentally explore the device design considerations for optimizing the performance of this far less explored class of thermal-to-electric generation devices. We fabricate Re <sub>4</sub> Si <sub>7</sub> TTEGs and show that there is no measurable loss in efficiency with a single set of contacts that are midway between the hot and cold ends. We show that a new effect must be considered: the appearance of transverse thermal gradients that lead to significant differences between the performance of TTEGs implemented in isothermal and adiabatic geometries. The isothermal TTEG configuration leads to much higher device efficiencies. Overall, this work highlights how different the design of TTEGs is from that of conventional TEGs and the importance of controlling the device geometry for optimum waste heat recovery. </p>","American Institute of Physics (AIP)","","The Ohio State University, Columbus, OH (United States)","USDOE Office of Science (SC), Basic Energy Sciences (BES); US Air Force Office of Scientific Research (AFOSR)","","United States","2022-06-23T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: Applied Physics Reviews; Journal Volume: 9; Journal Issue: 2","","Medium: ED; Size: Article No. 021420","","","SC0020923; FA9550–21-1–0268","Journal ID: ISSN 1931-9401","10.1063/5.0073354","","2023-01-11T00:00:00Z","1907068","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/1907068","","Applied Physics Reviews","2","9"
"Understanding Recoverable vs Unrecoverable Voltage Losses and Long-Term Degradation Mechanisms in Anion Exchange Membrane Fuel Cells","Ul Hassan, Noor; Zachman, Michael J.; Mandal, Mrinmay; Adabi Firouzjaie, Horie; Kohl, Paul A.; Cullen, David A.; Mustain, William E.","30 DIRECT ENERGY CONVERSION; 37 INORGANIC, ORGANIC, PHYSICAL, AND ANALYTICAL CHEMISTRY; 42 ENGINEERING; Fuel cell; anion exchange membrane; durability; performance; scanning transmission electron microscopy","Anion exchange membrane fuel cells (AEMFCs) have recently shown excellent progress in terms of their performance – e.g., achievable power and current density. However, very few AEMFCs have been demonstrated with the ability to operate for a long duration (>1000 h). In addition, it is unknown whether performance losses observed during operation are reversible, irreversible, or a combination of the two. In this study, a high-performance AEMFC operated continuously at 600 mA/cm<sup>2</sup> for 3600 h (150 days) at 80 °C with H<sub>2</sub>/O<sub>2</sub> reacting gases was demonstrated. Throughout testing, the electrochemical properties of the AEMFC were probed to provide information about performance degradation pathways and their degree of reversibility. It was found that a portion of the performance loss that occurs during AEMFC operation was due to suboptimal reaction conditions and can be recovered. At the end of the experiment, the cell was disassembled, and its structure and composition were evaluated at the nanoscale by aberration-corrected scanning transmission electron microscopy and energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy. The structure and composition of the electrode were compared to cells at the beginning of their operational life. It was found that the primary mechanism for long-term AEMFC performance loss was catalyst agglomeration. During the operational time, there was no evidence of significant polymer degradation, likely due to the high hydration state of the cell. By documenting the long-term changes in high-performing AEMFCs, this work provides important information for the systematic design of cell components and demonstrates the importance of controlling cell operation, which can aid in the commercialization and widespread deployment of low-cost, long-life AEMFCs.","American Chemical Society (ACS)","","Oak Ridge National Lab.

The battery showed the lowest LCC over 10 years ($\$ $14,935) among the three power sources, thanks to the significant price reduction in recent years. The fuel cost accounted for more than 70% of the total LCC of PEMFC ($\$ $36,682) when the hydrogen price was $\$ $8/kg. The LCC of DMFC ($\$ $41,819) with the current performance and catalyst loading (0.2 W/cm<sup>2</sup>, 6 mg<sub>PGM</sub>/cm<sup>2</sup>) was 12% higher than the LCC of PEMFC ($\$ $36,682). The LCC of DMFC ($\$ $25,050) will be 28.9% lower than that of PEMFC if both PEMFC and DMFC reach the target performance and catalyst loading set by the U.S. Department of Energy (1 W/ cm2, 0.125 mg<sub>PGM</sub>/cm2 for PEMFC and 0.3 W/cm<sup>2</sup>, 3 mg<sub>PGM</sub>/cm<sup>2</sup> for DMFC). The smaller fleet size will significantly increase the LCC of PEMFC due to the high cost of hydrogen fueling and storage infrastructure.

The water limiting current has been investigated as a function of relative humidity of anode and cathode streams, cathode backpressure and cell operating temperature. From these studies, it is clearly shown that water diffusion through the membrane from the anode is the most critical mechanism for achieving high current density performance and durability. The developed method can act as a novel screening technique that focuses on the impacts of water transport parameters and helps identify promising membrane materials based on their water transport properties.

In CSCs, the inductors/transformers have a predominantly dc flux to store energy, which can be offset by standard permanent magnets (PMs). However, eddy currents in standard PMs induce significant losses and thermal stress for medium-frequency applications. This article proposes using laminated PMs to offset the dc flux while reducing eddy currents, leading to significant reductions in the size, cost, and losses of inductors/transformers. Furthermore, the laminated PMs’ optimal location, orientation, and distribution are investigated to generalize this approach for maximum benefits. Here, three-dimensional finite-element analysis simulation and hardware experiments are presented to validate the effectiveness of the proposed approach in a medium-frequency transformer (MFT) for CSCs. Compared with standard PMs, the proposed use of laminated PMs reduces aggregate core-plus-PM losses by 85% in experiments, and thus, relaxes the MFT thermal design. Finally, the proposed approach is experimentally validated in a 40 kVA flyback-type MFT for a soft-switching solid-state transformer. Compared to the traditional design without any PMs, the proposed design increases the saturation current by 46% while inducing only 5% more losses, leading to significant savings in magnetics cost and size.","IEEE","","Georgia Institute of Technology, Atlanta, GA (United States)","USDOE Office of Energy Efficiency and Renewable Energy (EERE), Renewable Power Office.

Jeremy; Myers, Deborah J.; Cullen, David A.","30 DIRECT ENERGY CONVERSION; degradation; electrolysis","Stress tests are developed for proton exchange membrane electrolyzers that utilize low catalyst loading, elevated potential, and frequent cycling with square- and triangle-waves to accelerate anode catalyst layer degradation during intermittent operation. Kinetics drive performance losses (ohmic/transport secondary) and are accompanied by decreasing exchange current density, decreasing cyclic voltammetric capacitance, and increasing polarization resistance. Decreased kinetics are likely due to a combination of iridium (Ir) migration into electrochemically inaccessible locations in the anode or membrane, Ir particle growth (supported by X-ray scattering), changes in the extent of the Ir oxidation state (supported by X-ray absorption spectroscopy), and anode catalyst layer reordering. Decreasing catalyst/transport layer contact and catalyst/membrane interfacial tearing may add contact resistances and account for increasing ohmic losses. Performance losses for low and moderate catalyst loading, as well as from accelerated and model wind/solar cycling protocols, were likewise dominated by kinetics but vary in severity. Additionally, accelerated cycling (1 cycle per minute) appears to reasonably accelerate relevant loss mechanisms and can be used to project electrolyzer lifetime from anode deterioration. Ongoing accelerated stress test development and studies into performance loss mechanisms will continue to be critical as electrolysis shifts to intermittent power and low-cost applications.","IOP Publishing","","Oak Ridge National Lab.

Applied to ≈ 110 um thick electrode coatings, this work focuses on understanding the impact of laser ablation on electrode material properties at the beginning of life and synergistic impacts of ablated channels on cell performance throughout their cycle life. Post laser ablation, local changes in chemistry, crystallography, and morphology of the laser-impacted electrode regions are investigated. It is shown that femtosecond pulsed laser ablation can achieve high-rate material removal with minor material damage locally at the interface of the impacted zones. The capacity achieved during a 6C (10 min) constant-current constant-voltage charge to 4.2 V improved from 1 mAh cm<sup>-2</sup> for the non-ablated electrodes to almost 2 mAh cm<sup>-2</sup> for the ablated electrodes. This benefit is attributed to a synergistic effect of enhanced wetting and decreased electrode tortuosity. The benefit was maintained for over 120 cycles, and upon disassembly decreased Li-plating on the graphite anode was observed. Finally, multi-physics modeling in conjunction with wetting analyses showed that laser ablating either one of the electrodes led to substantial improvements in wetting and rate capability, indicating that substantial performance benefits can be achieved by ablating only the graphite anode as apposed to both electrodes.","Elsevier","","National Renewable Energy Lab.

Ensuring the quality of deposited catalyst layers is an essential step in the fuel cell manufacturing process, as the efficiency of a fuel cell is reliant on the catalyst layer being uniform at both the target platinum loading and the target ionomer content. Implementing a quality control method that is sensitive to these aspects is imperative, as wasting precious metals and other catalyst materials is expensive, and represents a potential barrier to entry into the field for manufacturers experimenting with novel deposition processes. In this work, we analyzed catalyst inks to determine if their ionomer content could be quantized spectroscopically. Attenuated total reflection (ATR) Fourier transform infrared spectroscopic technique was investigated producing a signal proportional to the ionomer content. ATR spectroscopy was able to quantitatively differentiate samples in which the ionomer to carbon mass ratio (I/C) varied between 0.9 and 3.0.

High-value use of C<sub>2</sub>H<sub>6</sub> has become increasingly important. Catalytic dehydrogenation of C<sub>2</sub>H<sub>6</sub> to ethylene (C<sub>2</sub>H<sub>4</sub>) has attracted much attention in recent years due to its high energy efficiency. The direct non-oxidative ethane dehydrogenation (EDH) to ethylene is a promising strategy to produce ethylene and hydrogen at the same time. In this research, Cr/HZSM-5 catalyst with superior stability was synthesized and exhibited an C<sub>2</sub>H<sub>6</sub> converting activity of 1.47 µmol/(g·s) with the corresponding C<sub>2</sub>H<sub>6</sub> conversion and C<sub>2</sub>H<sub>4</sub> selectivity of 37.3% and 90%, respectively. Herein, the synergistic effects of Si and Al in supporting materials were investigated by comparing Cr/HZSM-5 with SBA-15, SiO<sub>2</sub> and Al<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub> supported ones, which contains either Al or Si with different structures. Characterization results indicated that the intimate interactions between Cr and support significantly improved the catalytic performance. The presence of Al in the support promoted the formation of more active Cr<sup>6+</sup> species by forming the aluminum-chromium-chromate (Cr-O-Al) structures which were more efficient to active C-H bond and form (Cr, Al)-OH groups during the reaction. Meanwhile, the formation of internal silanol group with the dissociative adsorbed H* could stabilized the active Cr phase to achieve a stable dehydrogenation activity.","Elsevier","","Idaho National Lab.

The way that CO<sub>2</sub> is formed and transported during CO<sub>2</sub>-mediated bicarbonate reduction in flow cells is profoundly different from conventional CO<sub>2</sub> saturated and gas-fed systems and a thorough understanding of the process would allow further advancements. Here, we report a comprehensive two-phase mass transport model to estimate the local concentration of species in the porous electrode resultant from homogeneous and electrochemical reactions of (bi)carbonate and CO<sub>2</sub>. The model indicates that significant CO<sub>2</sub> is generated in the porous electrode during electrochemical reduction, even though the starting bicarbonate solution contains negligible CO<sub>2</sub>. However, the in situ formation of CO<sub>2</sub> and subsequent reduction to CO exhibits a plateau at high potentials due to neutralization of the protons by the alkaline reaction products, acting as the limiting step toward higher CO current densities. Nevertheless, the pH in the catalyst layer exhibits a relatively smaller rise, compared to conventional electrochemical CO<sub>2</sub> reduction cells, because of the reaction between protons and CO<sub>3</sub> <sup>2–</sup> and OH<sup>–</sup> that is confined to a relatively small volume. A large fraction of the CL exhibits a mildly alkaline environment at high current densities, while an appreciable amount of carbonic acid (0.1–1 mM) and a lower pH exist adjacent to the membrane, which locally favor hydrogen evolution, especially at low electrolyte concentrations. The results presented here provide insights into local cathodic conditions for both bicarbonate cells and direct-CO<sub>2</sub> reduction membrane electrode assembly cells utilizing cation exchange membranes facing the cathode.","American Chemical Society","","National Renewable Energy Lab.

As the battery industry shifts toward high Ni content cathodes, such as LiNi<sub>0.8</sub>Mn<sub>0.1</sub>Co<sub>0.1</sub>O<sub>2</sub> [NMC811] -- due to its higher specific capacity, better transport properties, and lower Co content -- a complete understanding of the degradation mechanisms of NMC811 under XFC conditions, and how those compare to lower Ni content cathodes, like LiNi0.5Mn0.3Co0.2O2 [NMC532], is needed. Such comprehensive understanding would identify the most critical materials gaps that need to be addressed for enabling XFC long-life cells for EVs. Using well-defined cells and charging protocols, this study maps out the key aging mechanisms for NMC811 cycled at different XFC conditions [at 1C-9C to 4.1V (~100% state-of-charge [SOC]) and at 9C to 3.63V (~35% SOC), 3.77V (~60% SOC), and 3.94V (~80% SOC)] for up to 1000 cycles. To acquire a fundamental understanding of utilization and degradation, cells were evaluated using a range of electrochemical techniques, and a suite of multimodal and multiscale microscopy techniques to quantify chemical, structural, and crystallographic degradation as a function of cycling conditions for the NMC cathode. When comparing NMC532 to NMC811, it is observed that NMC811 has a greater subsurface crystallographic degradation from layered to rock salt structures and displays a similar magnitude of sub particle cracking. However, the NMC811 maintains superior performance despite those advanced degradations. The superior cycle life performance is attributed to the NMC811 particles having radially oriented grains and improved transport properties. NMC811 showed between 4.6× to 3.15× reduction in capacity fade than NMC532 for charging rates between 4C (e.g., 15-minute charging) and 6C (10-minute charging).","Wiley","","National Renewable Energy Lab.

However, active materials are often heterogeneous, necessitating quantification of features over large volumes to achieve representativity which often requires reduced resolution for large fields of view. Cracks within Li-ion electrode particles are an example of fine features, representative quantification of which requires large volumes of tens of particles. To overcome the trade-off between the imaged volume of the material and the resolution achieved, we deploy generative adversarial networks (GAN), namely SRGANs, to super-resolve SEM images of cracked cathode materials. A quantitative analysis indicates that SRGANs outperform various other networks for crack detection within aged cathode particles. This makes GANs viable for performing super-resolution on microscopy images for mitigating the trade-off between resolution and field of view, thus enabling representative quantification of fine features.","Nature Publishing Group","","National Renewable Energy Lab.

Despite some success, these catalysts still have relatively high Pt content and lack the necessary durability as M metals leach out from the alloys during potential cycling. Previously, we synthesized nitrogen (N)-doped PtMN/C catalysts consisting of thin Pt shells on M nitride cores by a two-step method, which showed higher ORR activity and stability than their PtM counterparts. In the present work, we developed a facile one-step synthesis method, which comprises a single thermal annealing process of the N-doped PtNiN/C alloy. The ORR performance of the one-step synthesized PtNiN/C catalyst is much higher than that of the two-step synthesized PtNiN/C, as revealed by rotating disk electrode measurements. Membrane electrode assembly fuel cell testing demonstrated superb durability and high activity.

The surface and bulk composition and the structure of the PtNi NWs were investigated as a function of a series of postsynthesis modifications. The results from a combination of electron microscopy and X-ray spectroscopy characterization techniques were correlated to electrochemical performance to gain a comprehensive understanding of the structure-property-performance relationships. The robust structure of the ALD-derived NWs enabled additional postsynthesis optimization steps, which were not possible with previous-generation materials synthesized via spontaneous galvanic displacement, resulting in a catalyst with beneficial properties for catalyst kinetics as well as improved durability.

Here, in order to represent market gasoline (RD5-87), a four-component toluene primary reference fuel (TPRF) + ethanol (ETPRF) surrogate (with 20% ethanol by mole; E20) was formulated using a neural network based octane predictor such that the surrogate had the same ethanol content, Research Octane Number (RON) and Octane Sensitivity (S). In addition, a novel skeletal kinetic mechanism for ETPRF and TPRF + n-butanol (BTPRF) blends, incorporating polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon (PAH) chemistry, was developed. A three-dimensional (3D) engine CFD formulation employing the skeletal mechanism, adaptive mesh refinement (AMR), finite-rate chemistry approach, and hybrid method of moments (HMOM) was adopted to capture the in-cylinder combustion phenomena and soot emissions. The engine CFD model was validated against RD5-87 experimental data for a broad range of start-of-injection (SOI) timings (-21/-27/-36/-45 crank angle degrees (CAD) after top-dead center (aTDC)), with respect to in-cylinder pressure, heat release rate, combustion phasing, and soot emissions. The closed-cycle simulation results were analyzed to elucidate the non-monotonic trend of soot emissions versus SOI timing: SOI-36 > SOI-45 > SOI-21 > SOI-27. Thereafter, the validated CFD model was employed to simulate the combustion of a gasoline-ethanol blend with 45% (by mole) ethanol (E45) and a gasoline-butanol blend with 45% (by mole) n-butanol (B45) under the same operating conditions to study the effects of fuel composition and SOI timing on combustion phasing and soot emissions. The sooting propensity followed the trend: B45 > E20 > E45 at all SOI timings. Overall, it was observed that the autoignition propensity was primarily related to fuel chemistry. On the other hand, sooting propensity showed strong coupling with both fuel chemistry and physical properties, with greater impact of fuel physical properties at advanced SOI timings.","Elsevier","External Audience (Unlimited)","Lawrence Livermore National Lab.

This prioritizes efforts aimed at understanding and subsequently controlling catalyst microscopy (IL-STEM) is a powerful method that enables precise characterization of degradation processes in individual catalyst nanoparticles across various stages of cycling. Recreating the degradation processes that occur in PEMFC membrane electrode assemblies (MEAs) within the aqueous cell used for IL-STEM experiments is vital for generating an accurate understanding of these processes. In this work, we investigate the type and degree of catalyst degradation achieved by cycling in an aqueous cell compared to a PEMFC MEA. While significant degradation is observed in IL-STEM experiments performed on a traditional Pt catalyst using the standard accelerated stress test potential window (0.6-0.95 VRHE), degradation of a PtCo catalyst designed for heavy-duty vehicle use is very limited compared to that observed in MEAs. We therefore explore various experimental parameters such as temperature, acid type, acid concentration, ionomer content, and potential window to identify conditions that reproduce the degradation observed in MEAs. We find that by extending the cycling potential window to 0.4-1.0 VRHE in an electrolyte containing Pt ions, the degraded particle size distribution and alloy composition better match that observed in MEAs. In particular, these conditions increase the relative contribution of Ostwald ripening, which appears to play a more significant role in the degradation of larger alloy particles supported on high-surface-area carbons than coalescence. Results from this work highlight the potential for discrepancies between ex situ aqueous experiments and MEA tests. While different catalysts may require a unique modification to the AST protocol, strategies provided in this work enable future in situ and identicallocation experiments that will play an important role in the development of robust catalysts for heavy-duty vehicle applications.","American Chemical Society (ACS)","","National Renewable Energy Lab.

The CCLGDL design with only 0.08 mg<sub>Ir</sub> cm<sup>-2</sup> can achieve comparative cell performances to the conventional commercial electrode design, saving ~97% Ir catalyst and augmenting a catalyst utilization to ~24 times. CCLGDLs with regulated patterns enable insight into how pattern morphology impacts reaction kinetics and catalyst utilization in PEMECs. A specially designed two-sided transparent reaction-visible cell assists the in situ visualization of the PEM/electrode reaction interface for the first time. Oxygen gas is observed accumulating at the reaction interface, limiting the active area and increasing the cell impedances. In this work, it is demonstrated that mass transport in PEMECs can be modified by tuning CCLGDL patterns, thus improving the catalyst activation and utilization. The CCLGDL concept promises a future electrode design strategy with a simplified fabrication process and enhanced catalyst utilization. Furthermore, the CCLGDL concept also shows great potential in being a powerful tool for in situ reaction interface research in PEMECs and other energy conversion devices with solid polymer electrolytes.","Wiley","","National Renewable Energy Lab.

To get more insights into conditioning, a PEMEC with Ir-coated gas diffusion electrode (IrGDE) was investigated by electrochemistry and in situ visualization characterization techniques. The changes of polarization curves, electrochemical impedance spectra (EIS), and bubble dynamics before and after conditioning are analyzed. The polarization curves show that the cell efficiency increased by 9.15% at 0.4 A/cm<sup>2</sup>, and the EIS and Tafel slope results indicate that both the ohmic and activation overpotential losses decrease after conditioning. The visualization of bubble formation unveils that the number of bubble sites increased greatly from 14 to 29 per pore after conditioning, at the same voltage of 1.6 V. Under the same current density of 0.2 A/cm<sup>2</sup>; the average bubble detachment size decreased obviously from 35 to 25 µm. Furthermore, the electrochemistry and visualization characterization results jointly unveiled the increase of reaction sites and the surface oxidation on the IrGDE during conditioning, which provides more insights into the conditioning and benefits for the future GDE design and optimization.","American Chemical Society (ACS)","","National Renewable Energy Lab.

Here, we present a comprehensive review of the fundamentals of electrocatalysis in alkaline media and applications in alkaline-based energy technologies, particularly alkaline fuel cells and water electrolyzers. Anion exchange (alkaline) membrane fuel cells (AEMFCs) enable the use of nonprecious electrocatalysts for the sluggish oxygen reduction reaction (ORR), relative to proton exchange membrane fuel cells (PEMFCs), which require Pt-based electrocatalysts. However, the hydrogen oxidation reaction (HOR) kinetics is significantly slower in alkaline media than in acidic media. Understanding these phenomena requires applying theoretical and experimental methods to unravel molecular-level thermodynamics and kinetics of hydrogen and oxygen electrocatalysis and, particularly, the proton-coupled electron transfer (PCET) process that takes place in a proton-deficient alkaline media. Extensive electrochemical and spectroscopic studies, on single-crystal Pt and metal oxides, have contributed to the development of activity descriptors, as well as the identification of the nature of active sites, and the rate-determining steps of the HOR and ORR. Among these, the structure and reactivity of interfacial water serve as key potential and pH-dependent kinetic factors that are helping elucidate the origins of the HOR and ORR activity differences in acids and bases. Additionally, deliberately modulating and controlling catalyst-support interactions have provided valuable insights for enhancing catalyst accessibility and durability during operation. The design and synthesis of highly conductive and durable alkaline membranes/ionomers have enabled AEMFCs to reach initial performance metrics equal to or higher than those of PEMFCs. We emphasize the importance of using membrane electrode assemblies (MEAs) to integrate the often separately pursued/optimized electrocatalyst/support and membranes/ionomer components. Operando/in situ methods, at multiscales, and ab initio simulations provide a mechanistic understanding of electron, ion, and mass transport at catalyst/ionomer/membrane interfaces and the necessary guidance to achieve fuel cell operation in air over thousands of hours. We hope that this Review will serve as a roadmap for advancing the scientific understanding of the fundamental factors governing electrochemical energy conversion in alkaline media with the ultimate goal of achieving ultralow Pt or precious-metal-free high-performance and durable alkaline fuel cells and related technologies.","American Chemical Society","","National Renewable Energy Lab.

"Silica: ubiquitous poison of metal oxide interfaces","Staerz, Anna; Seo, Han Gil; Defferriere, Thomas; Tuller, Harry L.","36 MATERIALS SCIENCE; 30 DIRECT ENERGY CONVERSION; 37 INORGANIC, ORGANIC, PHYSICAL, AND ANALYTICAL CHEMISTRY; silica; catalytic poison; sensors; fuel cells; oxygen reduction reaction; grain boundaries","In this review, we consider electrochemical applications, broadly conceived, in which both ions and electrons play key roles in device operation and where exchange of oxygen between the gas and solid phase is likewise essential for operation. Examples include metal oxide gas sensors (semiconducting and electrolytic), solid oxide fuel and electrolysis cells, oxygen permeation membranes, oxygen storage materials and metal oxide-based catalysts. As might be expected, surfaces and interfaces play key or essential roles in the operation of all of these types of devices. Semiconducting metal oxide (SMOX) sensors depend on the adsorption/diffusion of gas species on the surfaces or exposed grain boundaries and subsequent charge transfer between the semiconductor and the adsorbed gas atoms or molecules for their operation. Fuel cells require reduction of oxygen molecules at the cathode and subsequent incorporation into the electrolyte, diffusion across the electrolyte, (including across grain boundaries within the electrolyte) and subsequent oxidation of the oxygen ions at the anode and their exit back into the gas phase by reaction with reactive gas phase hydrocarbons or hydrogen to form CO, CO<sub>2</sub> and or H<sub>2</sub>O. Understandably, any process that interferes with these surface or interface reactions is undesirable. This may take the form of inert layers of materials that literally block access of oxygen, electrons or other reactive species to respective surfaces or interfaces or “poison” the catalytic activity of surface or interface sites needed for the efficient functioning of the devices. One omnipresent chemical species that appears to serve to “poison” the operation of many such electrochemical devices is some form of silica or SiO<sub>x</sub>, or in combination of other cations to form silicates. Interestingly, while silica and other poisons, e.g. chromia for solid oxide fuel cell cathodes, are known to be the sources of degradation of many functional electrochemical devices, the detailed mechanisms behind their effectiveness in depressing functionality remain controversial or poorly understood. Since a major focus of Professor John Kilner's research and publications have been concerned with chemical species that interfere with transport across grain boundaries and electrochemical reactions at metal oxide surfaces, including that of silica, we dedicate this review in his honour. We also take the opportunity in this review to more broadly introduce our recent findings regarding the critical role that the relative acidity or basicity of surface additives may have on hindering or accelerating the reaction kinetics on metal oxide surfaces, thereby providing a more detailed understanding of the reactivity of common poisons like silica in degrading device performance and means for combating their impact.","Royal Society of Chemistry (RSC)","","Massachusetts Inst. of Technology (MIT), Cambridge, MA (United States); National Energy Technology Laboratory (NETL), Pittsburgh, PA, Morgantown, WV, and Albany, OR (United States)","USDOE Office of Fossil Energy (FE); USDOE Office of Science (SC), Basic Energy Sciences (BES)","","United Kingdom","2022-02-08T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: Journal of Materials Chemistry.

The concept combines a low-thermal-resistance package (which eliminates metalized ceramic substrates) with a high-performance convective cooling strategy (slot jets impinging on finned surfaces). Modeling was first used to design the cooling system to maximize thermal performance and minimize pumping power. Additionally, a prototype was then fabricated, and experiments were conducted to validate the model predictions using three fluids at various fluid flow rates (16.7 cm<sup>3</sup>/s [1 L/min] to 68.3 cm<sup>3</sup>/s [4.1 L/min]) and inlet temperatures (30C and 70C).

The validated model was then used to predict the junction-to-fluid thermal resistance and pumping power for various conditions, including 40C fluid temperature. The results predict thermal resistance values as low as 19 mm<sup>2</sup>K/W are possible using the dielectric fluid cooling approach.

"Improved performance of a near-field thermophotovoltaic device by a back gapped reflector","Feng, Dudong; Yee, Shannon K.; Zhang, Zhuomin M.","30 DIRECT ENERGY CONVERSION; back gapped reflector; back surface reflector; near-field thermophotovoltaics; external luminescence; surface recombination and passivation","Various spectral control techniques can be applied to improve the performance of a thermophotovoltaic (TPV) device. For example, a back surface reflector (BSR) is a common structure to improve the performance of TPV devices. A conventional metal BSR structure enhances the photogeneration rate by increasing the absorption probability of photons via back surface reflections, affording a second chance for absorption. However, the effects of surface passivation and external luminescence introduced by BSR structures have been previously ignored, which potentially decreases the performance of TPV devices. Recently, a back gapped reflector (BGR) structure was proposed to greatly improve the performance of far-field TPV devices by reducing imperfect reflections at the semiconductor-metal interface. In the present work, the performance improvement on a thin-film, near-field InAs TPV device with a BGR is investigated, comparing its performance to that with a conventional metal BSR. Surface passivation conditions are also investigated to further improve the performance of TPV devices with back reflectors. Further, the output power and efficiency are calculated using an iterative model combining fluctuational electrodynamics and the full drift diffusion model. For the well-passivated condition, when the BSR is replaced by the BGR, the calculated conversion efficiency of the near-field TPV was improved from 16.4% to 21% and the output power was increased by 10%. Finally, the absorption of the back reflectors and external luminescence loss are analyzed to explain the performance improvement.","Elsevier","","Georgia Institute of Technology, Atlanta, GA (United States)","USDOE Office of Science (SC), Basic Energy Sciences (BES)","","United States","2021-12-28T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: Solar Energy Materials and Solar Cells; Journal Volume: 237","","Medium: ED; Size: Article No. 111562","","","SC0018369","Journal ID: ISSN 0927-0248","10.1016/j.solmat.2021.111562","","2022-12-28T00:00:00Z","1866204","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/1866204","https://www.osti.gov/servlets/purl/1866204","Solar Energy Materials and Solar Cells","","237"

More specifically, the campaign comprised a reference gasoline, an ethanol/gasoline blend (10% v/v) representative of renewable fuels, and an additised gasoline sample treated with viscoelasticity-inducing agents. High-speed imaging of the transient two-phase flow field arising in the internal geometry and the near-nozzle spray region of gasoline injectors was performed employing Diffuse Backlight Illumination. The metallic body of a commercial injector was modified to fit transparent tips realising two nozzle layouts, namely a two-hole real size model resembling the Engine Combustion Network spray G injector and an enraged replica with an offset hole. Experiments were conducted at realistic operating conditions comprising an injection pressure of 100 bar and ambient pressures in the range of 0.1–6.0 bar to cover the entire range of chamber pressures prevailing in Gasoline Direct Injection engines. The action of viscoelastic additives was verified to have a suppressive effect on in-nozzle cavitation (6% reduction in cavitation extent) , while also enhancing spray atomisation at flash-boing conditions, in a manner resembling the more volatile gasoline/ethanol blends.

The model also accounts for volumetric swelling of the anode due to redox cycling. Porosity change and swelling during redox combined with normal operating thermomechanical loads could increase the stress, strain and damage distributions in SOFC stacks leading them to failure. The proposed model involves three governing parameters: (i) the porosity in terms of the pore or void volume fraction, (ii) material swelling magnitude prescribed at a given loading step, and (iii) the damage variable that describes microcracking caused by thermomechanical loads and swelling. Pores and microcracks in the ceramics are modeled as randomly distributed ellipsoidal inclusions with negligible stiffness by an Eshelby-Mori-Tanaka formulation combined with an inclusion orientation distribution method. Microcracking damage evolution is described by a CDM formulation. Volumetric swelling is treated in a similar way to thermal expansion in the constitutive relations. After validation and numerical checks, the damage model is used to analyze a simplified SOFC positive-electrode/electrolyte/negative-electrode (PEN) structure subjected a redox cycle in addition to thermomechanical loads experienced during normal operation of a SOFC stack.","Elsevier","","Pacific Northwest National Lab.

In this work, an advanced type of thermally activated cooling system, an organic Rankine-vapor compression cycle (ORVC) with novel heat integration strategies, was designed and tested at a relevant scale for industrial waste heat recovery (300 kW<sub>th</sub> cooling capacity). The ORVC linked an organic Rankine power cycle and a vapor compression cooling cycle using a turbine and compressor that shared a single shaft. The ORVC test facility absorbed waste heat from a liquid stream at 91 °C to simulate engine coolant in diesel generator sets, rejected heat to a glycol stream at 30 °C, and generated chilled water at 7 °C. A cooling capacity of 264 kW ± 3.5 kW was experimentally validated with a COP of 0.56 ± 0.01 during steady-state operation at the design temperatures. The thermal efficiency, accounting for pump work, of the Rankine cycle was 7.7% ± 0.22% and the COP of the vapor compression cycle was 5.25 ± 0.09. The centrifugal turbo-compressor operated at 31.5 kRPM ± 0.3 kRPM, with a turbine and compressor isentropic efficiencies of 76.7% ± 0.90% and 84.8% ± 0.54%, respectively, with near-perfect power transmission between these components. The pressure drop in the piping and heat exchangers were significantly larger than expected which had a detrimental impact on the performance of the ORVC. In addition, the condenser on the cooling cycle could not deliver the subcooling as specified from the design point modeling. Furthermore, the results from the sensitivity analysis showed that the higher condenser glycol outlet temperature had the largest impact on performance, which is consistent with other analytical models in the literature. When the ORVC simulations were updated with experimental values for isentropic efficiencies of the turbomachinery, the thermal COP was 0.66 which represents an estimate of the predicted performance if test facility limitations are overcome.","Elsevier","","Colorado State Univ., Fort Collins, CO (United States)","USDOE Office of Energy Efficiency and Renewable Energy (EERE)","Barber-Nichols, Inc.; Modine Manufacturing Co.","United States","2021-11-27T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: Applied Energy; Journal Volume: 307","","Medium: ED; Size: Article No. 118242","","","EE0008325","Journal ID: ISSN 0306-2619","10.1016/j.apenergy.2021.118242","","2023-04-24T00:00:00Z","1970476","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/1970476","https://www.osti.gov/servlets/purl/1970476","Applied Energy","","307"

Two mixed ionic/electronic conducting structures are examined for the oxygen producing electrode in this work: single layer porous lanthanum strontium cobalt ferrite (LSCF), and bilayer LSCF/SCT (strontium cobalt tantalum oxide) structures. A yttrium-stabilized zirconia (YSZ) electrolyte separates the hydrogen and oxygen electrodes, as well as a gadolinium doped-ceria (GDC) buffer layer on the oxygen electrode side. Electrochemical reactions occurring at the two-phase boundaries (2PBs) and three-phase boundaries (3PBs) of single-layer LSCF and bilayer LSCF/SCT oxygen electrodes are modeled under various SOEC voltages with lattice oxygen stoichiometry as the key output. The results reveal that there exists a competition in electrode kinetics between 2PBs and 3PBs, but 3PBs are the primary reactive sites for single-layer LSCF oxygen electrode under high voltages. These locations experience the greatest oxygen stoichiometry variations and are therefore the most likely locations for dimensional changes. By applying an active SCT layer over LSCF, the 2PBs become activated to compete with the 3PBs, thus alleviating oxygen stoichiometry variations and reducing the likelihood of dimensional change. This strategy could reduce lattice structural expansion, proving to be valuable for electrode-electrolyte delamination prevention and will be the focus of future work.</p>","The Electrochemical Society","","National Renewable Energy Lab.

"A Multiport DC Transformer to Enable Flexible Scalable DC as a Service","Mauger, Mickael J.; Chowdhury, Vikram Roy; Kandula, Prasad; Divan, Deepak","30 DIRECT ENERGY CONVERSION; Current Source Inverter; DCaaS; DC as a Service; MDCT; modular power converter; multiport converter; S4T; solid-state transformer; soft-switching; ZVS","The rapid adoption of new DC loads and sources, including photovoltaic arrays, DC fast charging of electric vehicle, battery energy storage and data centers, requires a large amount of DC power conversion. A majority of new deployments also necessitate the integration of multiple DC loads and sources at one site. The traditional approach to serve these new applications relies on multiple standard power converters, each dedicated to a source or load, and results in highly customized systems, with challenging control coordination, complex protection strategies, and poor scalability. Instead, this paper proposes the concept of a multiport DC transformer (MDCT) as a modular building block for realizing a flexible, scalable DC as a Service system and address this rapidly growing need. The MDCT uses the S4T to achieve very tight control of cycle-by-cycle energy exchange between multiple ports, with high efficiency. A single multiport converter replaces 4-6 distinct converters, integrates all energy flows and manages protection. As a result, a new layered control architecture is introduced to ensure stability and scalability of the MDCT, with multiple S4T power converter building blocks connected in parallel to realize a fully modular system and reach the target power levels.","IEEE","","Georgia Institute of Technology, Atlanta, GA (United States)","USDOE Office of Energy Efficiency and Renewable Energy (EERE), Renewable Power Office.

They are more significant in current source converters, where the dc-link energy is stored in an inductor/transformer. In such cases, the magnetics have a predominantly DC flux, superimposed by an AC flux at switching frequency. Previously, permanent magnets have been proposed to offset the DC flux and thereby reduce the size, cost, and losses of the inductors/transformers. This paper starts by analyzing the issue of eddy currents when using such standard permanent magnets, especially in medium frequency applications, making them practically unusable. Alternatively, the paper proposes the use of laminated permanent magnets to reduce these eddy currents and thereby realize the benefits of offsetting the DC flux to reduce the size, cost, and loss of inductors/transformers. Using a soft-switching solid-state transformer as an example, experimental results are presented to show the impact of eddy currents in standard permanent magnets when used with a medium frequency transformer.

Instead, a model-based predictive control (MPC) is proposed to achieve robust and stable operation. As is well known, the control performance of MPC is compromised by the sampling and computational delay during implementation significantly, if not well addressed. This paper analyzed and quantified these delays and then proposes feed-forward compensation (FFC) for the MPC method to compensate the delays and the large parameter variations due to the low-inertia nature. In addition, this method also compensates for the high dc-link ripple within each switching cycle, a unique issue for low-inertia converters. Here, the proposed method requires low computational effort, allowing it to be extended for multiple ports. The effectiveness of the proposed method has been validated in experiments. In 10 kW test, the proposed method decreases the average dc-link current by 17%, leading to ~20% conduction losses and ~0.5% increase in converter efficiency. In addition, the peak dc-link current also decreases by 15%, resulting in reduced transformer size. As a result, an increased power density can be achieved with the proposed method. Similar improvements have been observed across the power range from 2 kW to 10 kW.","IEEE","","Georgia Institute of Technology, Atlanta, GA (United States)","USDOE Office of Energy Efficiency and Renewable Energy (EERE), Renewable Power Office.

Here, we systematically investigate a family of dilute Cu-based alloys to explore their viability as active and selective catalysts for eCO<sub>2</sub>R through a combined theoretical–experimental approach. Using a quantum–classical modeling approach that accounts for dynamic solvation effects, we assess the stability and activity of model single-atom catalysts under eCO<sub>2</sub>R conditions. Our calculations identify that the presence of eCO2R intermediates, such as CO*, H*, and OH*, may dynamically influence the local catalyst surface composition. Additionally, we identify through binding energy descriptors of the CO*, CHO*, and OCCO* dimer intermediates that certain elements, such as group 13 elements (B, Al, and Ga), enhance the selectivity of C<sub>2+</sub> species relative to pure Cu by facilitating CO dimerization. The theoretical work is corroborated by preliminary testing of eCO<sub>2</sub>R activity and selectivity of candidate dilute Cu-based alloy catalyst films prepared by electron beam evaporation in a zero-gap gas diffusion electrode-based reactor. Of all studied alloys, dilute CuAl was found to be the most active and selective toward C<sub>2+</sub> products like ethylene, consistent with the theoretical predictions. Finally, we attribute the improved performance of dilute CuAl alloys to more favorable dimerization reaction energetics of bound CO species relative to that on pure Cu. In a broader context, the results presented here demonstrate the power of our simulation framework in terms of rational catalyst design.","American Institute of Physics (AIP)","External Audience (Unlimited)","Lawrence Livermore National Lab.

To understand the formation of PAHs, the low-molecular-weight hydrocarbon chemistry leading to their formation needs to be understood. Toward this goal, fuel-rich oxidation of three different hydrocarbons, i.e., ethylene, toluene, and n-decane, has been investigated in an atmospheric pressure flow reactor at varying temperatures (1000–1350 K), equivalence ratios (φ = 3.0–12.0), and residence times of 0.25–1.5 s. The major C<sub>1</sub> to C<sub>7</sub> intermediates, such as methane, acetylene, ethylene, allene, propyne, propylene, vinylacetylene, 1,3-butadiene, cyclopentadiene, benzene, and toluene, were quantified using a gas chromatograph equipped with a flame ionization detector. The experimental tendency of intermediate species formation, e.g., the dependence of temperature, equivalence ratio, and residence time, was similar in ethylene oxidation and n-decane oxidation. The concentrations of intermediate species up to C<sub>4</sub> were higher in ethylene/n-decane oxidation than toluene oxidation, while a nearly equal or larger amount of C5–C7 species was produced in toluene oxidation. The experimental data were compared with modeling results using a detailed chemical kinetic mechanism. The calculated data using the kinetic model were in agreement with the experimental results. Additionally, a comprehensive kinetic analysis on the reaction pathways of each species was conducted to assess the differences in the oxidation chemistry with the change in the structure of hydrocarbons. In particular, in-depth analysis of benzene formation was performed, elucidating that two benzene formation pathways were important in ethylene and n-decane oxidation: (1) H elimination of the 2,4-cyclohexadienyl radical produced from the isomerization of the 2,4-cyclopentadienylmethyl radical, and (2) dehydrogenation of cyclohexadiene produced from reactions of vinyl radical with 1,3-butadiene. In toluene oxidation, it was found that benzene was primarily produced from toluene through the replacement of the methyl group with hydrogen.","American Chemical Society (ACS)","External Audience (Unlimited)","Lawrence Livermore National Lab.

Kinetic experiments and surface characterization suggested that the activity of In<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub> catalysts cannot be simply correlated with the abundance of surface oxygen vacancies (O<sub>v</sub>) formed by either H<sub>2</sub>-reduction or thermal treatment, which has been frequently invoked in previous studies. The support effect should originate from the electronic interactions between In<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub> and the support oxide, rather than geometric factors or the difference in the particle size of In<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub>. Theoretical modelling revealed that surface O<sub>v</sub> facilitate the formation and stabilization of the formate (HCOO*) intermediate. While a carbonate-like structure is favored for CO<sub>2</sub> adsorption on CeO<sub>2</sub>-supported or unsupported In<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub> catalysts, CO<sub>2</sub> tends to bind strongly in a bent configuration on the O<sub>v</sub> site at the In<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub>-ZrO<sub>2</sub> interface. The distinct CO<sub>2</sub> adsorption structures on different supported In<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub> catalysts may account for the different reaction energy profiles in the subsequent hydrogenation reactions, especially the rate-limiting step, i.e., hydrogenation of HCOO* to CH<sub>2</sub>O* and methoxy (CH<sub>3</sub>O*). The relatively higher methanol selectivity of In<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub> catalyst supported on ZrO<sub>2</sub> with respect to that on CeO<sub>2</sub> are suggested to stem from the greater energy difference (Δ$E_a$) between the parallel hydrogenation and C-O bond cleavage of HCOO*, which leads to the formation of methanol and CO, respectively.

Conventional FTEs composed of random, porous media provide limited opportunity for architectural control and engineering of microscale transport. Alternatively, the design freedom engendered by additively manufacturing FTEs yields additional opportunities to further drive performance via flow engineering. Through experiment and validated continuum computation we analyze the mass transfer in three-dimensional (3D)–printed porous FTEs with periodic lattice structures and show that, in contrast to conventional electrodes, the mesoscopic length scales in 3D-printed electrodes lead to an increase in the mass correlation exponent as inertial flow effects dominate. Fnally, the inertially enhanced mass transport yields mass transfer coefficients that exceed previously reported 3D-printed FTEs by 10 to 100 times, bringing 3D-printed FTE performance on par with conventional materials.","Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences","","Lawrence Livermore National Lab.

"Analysis of the Reactive CO<sub>2</sub> Surface Flux in Electrocatalytic Aqueous Flow Reactors","Lin, Tiras Y.; Baker, Sarah E.; Duoss, Eric B.; Beck, Victor A.","30 DIRECT ENERGY CONVERSION","We study how the mass transfer of a chemical species in shear flow is suppressed by the production of a second species that partially reacts away the first species. The second species is produced at the surface with the first species as a reactant. Our work is directly motivated by electrochemical CO<sub>2</sub> reduction in aqueous flow reactors, where OH– molecules generated by the CO evolution reaction react away CO<sub>2</sub> molecules, ultimately inhibiting the mass transfer of CO<sub>2</sub> to the cathode surface. We derive a simple approximation of the Sherwood number, a dimensionless measure of the mass flux into the surface, as a function of the Péclet number, surface Damköhler number, and bulk Damköhler number, and we compare our approximation to numerical solutions of the governing equations. We find that in the diffusion-limited regime, the Sherwood number is well described by the classical Graetz-Lévêque result reduced by a reaction factor due to the competing bulk reaction; with the stoichiometry relevant to electrochemical CO<sub>2</sub> reduction, this reaction factor is 1/2. While the model problem we solve provides insight into how OH– production affects CO<sub>2</sub> mass transfer, experimental systems often involve more complex chemistry. We thus also show how a common buffered electrolyte, KHCO<sub>3</sub>, affects our results.","American Chemical Society (ACS)","External Audience (Unlimited)","Lawrence Livermore National Lab.

"Hybrid-energy approach enabled by heat storage and oxy-combustion to generate electricity with near-zero or negative CO<sub>2</sub> emissions","Buscheck, Thomas A.; Upadhye, Ravindra S.","30 DIRECT ENERGY CONVERSION; fossil energy; biomass energy; variable renewable energy; granular media heat storage; CO2 capture and storage; geothermal energy","We assess a hybrid-energy approach that modifies a steam-turbine power plant to use renewable energy sources (electricity, plus options for geothermal and solar heat), plus fossil fuel (natural gas and coal) and/or waste biomass (e.g., Douglas fir woodchips). Heat storage allows heat to be created during periods of excess energy supply and for that heat to be converted to electricity when demanded. Excess electricity, such as from variable renewable energy (VRE), is used to generate oxygen for oxy-combustion furnaces that create very-hot, high-purity CO<sub>2</sub> that heats granular rock beds in insulated vessels. Cool CO<sub>2</sub> leaving the beds is dried, sent to compressors powered by excess VRE electricity, before being sent by pipeline to geologic CO<sub>2</sub> storage. Very-hot CO<sub>2</sub> transfers high-grade heat from storage to the power plant in a closed loop that returns medium-grade heat back to storage, allowing low- and medium-grade renewable-heat sources to be stacked beneath combustion heat, with all heat sources being converted to electricity at the same (high) thermal efficiency. Reliable, on-demand power may be generated with near-zero CO<sub>2</sub> emissions with fossil fuel and with negative CO<sub>2</sub> emissions with waste biomass. Our analyses show that with fossil fuel, up to 35% of gross power can be derived from renewable sources, while for waste biomass, it can be entirely derived from renewable sources. Because our approach has the potential to ensure that grids have a continuous supply of clean energy and because electricity is only generated once, when demanded, it could serve as an efficient alternative to bulk energy storage.","Elsevier","External Audience (Unlimited)","Lawrence Livermore National Lab.

Because thermostatically controlled loads constitute most of the power consumed by the grid at any given time, the proper control of such devices can lead to significant energy savings and improved grid stability. The contribution of this paper is the development of an optimal control algorithm for commonly used variable speed heat pumps.

This luminescent effect can substantially alter the local net photogeneration in near-field thermophotovoltaic cells. Several assumptions involving the luminescent effect are commonly made in modeling photovoltaic devices; in particular, the photon chemical potential is assumed to be zero or a constant prescribed by the bias voltage. The significance of photon chemical potential depends upon the emitter temperature, the semiconductor properties, and the injection level. Hence, these assumptions are questionable in near-field thermophotovoltaic devices with nanoscale separation distances between the emitter and the cell. In the present work, an iterative solver that combines fluctuational electrodynamics with the drift-diffusion model is developed to tackle the coupled photon and charge transport problem, enabling the determination of the spatial profile of photon chemical potential beyond the detailed balance approach. Here, the difference between the results obtained by allowing the photon chemical potential to vary spatially and by assuming a constant value demonstrates the limitations of the conventional approaches. This study is critically important for performance evaluation of near-field thermophotovoltaic systems with nanoscale vacuum gaps.","American Institute of Physics (AIP)","","Georgia Institute of Technology, Atlanta, GA (United States); National Renewable Energy Lab.

Charge-carrier dynamics in semiconductors are well-described by the Poisson-drift-diffusion equations, and thermal radiation in emitter-absorber structures can be computed using multilayer fluctuational electrodynamics. These two types of energy flows interact through radiation absorption or luminescence and charge-carrier generation or recombination. However, past research has typically only assumed limited interaction, with thermal radiation absorption as an input for charge-carrier models to predict device performance. To examine this assumption, we develop a fully coupled iterative model of charge and radiation transport in semiconductor devices, and we use our model to analyze near-field and far-field GaSb thermophotovoltaic and thermoradiative systems. By comparing our results with past methods that do not consider cross-influences between charge and radiation transport, we find that a fully coupled approach is necessary to accurately model photon recycling and near-field enhancement of external luminescence. As these effects can substantially alter device performance, our modeling approach can aid in the design of efficient thermophotovoltaic and thermoradiative systems.","American Physical Society (APS)","","National Renewable Energy Lab.

As in situ electrochemical mechanism determination by experiments is still out of reach, such mechanistic analysis typically is conducted using density functional theory (DFT). The semilocal exchange-correlation (XC) approximations most often used to model such catalysis unfortunately engender a basic error: predicting the wrong adsorption site for CO (a key CO<sub>2</sub>RR intermediate) on the most ubiquitous facet of Cu, namely, Cu(111). This longstanding inconsistency casts lingering doubt on previous DFT predictions of the attendant CO<sub>2</sub>RR kinetics. Here, we apply embedded correlated wavefunction (ECW) theory, which corrects XC functional error, to study the CO<sub>2</sub>RR on Cu(111) via both surface hydride (*H) transfer and proton-coupled electron transfer (PCET). We predict that adsorbed CO (*CO) reduces almost equally to two intermediates, namely, hydroxymethylidyne (*COH) and formyl (*CHO) at –0.9 V vs the RHE. In contrast, semilocal DFT approximations predict a strong preference for *COH. With increasing applied potential, the dominance of *COH (formed via potential-independent surface *H transfer) diminishes, switching to the competitive formation of both *CHO and *COH (both formed via potential-dependent PCET). Furthermore, our results also demonstrate the importance of including explicitly modeled solvent molecules in predicting electron-transfer barriers and reveal the pitfalls of overreliance on simple surface *H transfer models of reduction reactions.","American Chemical Society (ACS)","","Princeton Univ., NJ (United States)","USDOE Office of Science (SC), Basic Energy Sciences (BES)","","United States","2021-04-14T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: Journal of the American Chemical Society; Journal Volume: 143; Journal Issue: 16","","Medium: ED; Size: p. 6152-6164","","","AC02-05CH11231","Journal ID: ISSN 0002-7863; TRN: US2212875","10.1021/jacs.1c00880","","2022-09-29T00:00:00Z","1808091","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/1808091","https://www.osti.gov/servlets/purl/1808091","Journal of the American Chemical Society","16","143"

This prototype is inspired by the pressure exchangers used in reverse-osmosis (RO) desalination systems. In this system, a 2D model was generated and modeled using the computational fluid dynamics (CFD) technique. The numerical model ignored any losses due to leakage or hydraulic friction and the process is considered adiabatic. For the modeling, it was assumed that the inlet conditions for the two pressure exchanger flows are similar to the flow conditions at the evaporator and gas cooler outlets in a VC cycle. Two parameters are examined to test the validity of the system and understand their effect on the performance, including the inlet flow rate represented by the inlet velocity and the process time represented by the speed of rotation.

However, there are a small number of compounds, mostly metals, that exhibit simultaneous p-type and n-type conduction behavior along different crystallographic directions. We demonstrate that the experimental discovery of semiconductors with this axis-dependent conduction polarity can be facilitated by identifying a large anisotropy of either the electron or hole effective masses (m*) or both, providing the electron and hole masses dominate along different crystallographic directions. We calculated the layered semiconductor NaSnAs to have a lower electron m* in-plane than the cross-plane and a very large hole m* in-plane and small hole m* cross-plane. We established the growth of >3 mm-sized NaSnAs crystals via Sn flux and confirmed the band gap to be 0.65 eV, in agreement with theory. NaSnAs exhibits p-type thermopowers cross-plane and n-type thermopowers in-plane, confirming that the large anisotropy in the effective mass at the band edges is an excellent indicator for axis-dependent conduction polarity. Altogether, this work shows that the discovery of semiconductors with such a phenomenon can be accelerated by computationally evaluating the anisotropic curvatures of the band edges, paving the way for their future discovery and application.","American Chemical Society (ACS)","","The Ohio State Univ., Columbus, OH (United States)","USDOE Office of Science (SC), Engineering & Technology; USDOE Office of Science (SC), Basic energy sciences (BES)","","United States","2021-01-15T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: Chemistry of Materials; Journal Volume: 33; Journal Issue: 3","","Medium: ED; Size: p. 946-951","","","SC0020923","Journal ID: ISSN 0897-4756","10.1021/acs.chemmater.0c04030","","2022-12-22T00:00:00Z","1773942","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/1773942","https://www.osti.gov/servlets/purl/1773942","Chemistry of Materials","3","33"

The COP of the EHP is improved by using binary fluids (HFE7500 and water), and the high backpressure in the primary ejector (first-stage) is actively controlled by either a second-stage ejector and/or a LiBr-H<sub>2</sub>O absorption subsystem. A thermodynamic model is established for analysis and performance evaluation. A case study shows the backpressure of the first-stage ejector is reduced by 53.5%, and the backpressure control using the second-stage ejector increases the system COP by 21.0% compared with that using LiBr-H<sub>2</sub>O absorption. Parametric studies are conducted to investigate the roles of the first-stage ejector, the second-stage ejector, and the LiBr-H<sub>2</sub>O absorption subsystem. The first-stage ejector plays a dominant role in the EHP system performance. The EHP’s heating COP can reach 2.0 with an entrainment ratio of 0.12 in the first-stage ejector.

By operating the cell briefly as a solid oxide electrolyzer cell (SOEC), the cleaning method effectively reverses the Cr deposition reactions, reforming Cr-containing vapor species, thereby freeing up electrochemically active sites and restoring cell functioning. In practice, this method can be periodically applied to the system after a specified amount of degradation due to chromium poisoning has occurred. The current study investigates the efficacy of this method by cycling a single cell through a stage of accelerated poisoning followed by electrochemical cleaning for a total of three times. Current-voltage measurements demonstrate repeated loss in performance due to Cr poisoning and recovery in performance due to electrochemical cleaning, reinforcing the utility of this cleaning method over the lifetime of the cell operation.","Elsevier","","Boston Univ., MA (United States)","USDOE Office of Fossil Energy (FE)","","Country unknown/Code not available","2020-12-01T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: Journal of Power Sources Advances Journal Volume: 6 Journal Issue: C","","Medium: X; Size: Article No. 100037","","","FE0031206","Journal ID: ISSN 2666-2485; S2666248520300378; 100037; PII: S2666248520300378","10.1016/j.powera.2020.100037","","2021-03-23T00:00:00Z","1706171","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/1706171","","Journal of Power Sources Advances","C","6"

Specifically, one actively researched approach is the two-step STC cycle, which uses a redox-active, off-stoichiometric, transition-metal oxide material to split water and/or CO<sub>2</sub>, generating H<sub>2</sub> and/or CO, respectively, or syngas (a combination of H<sub>2</sub> and CO). Identifying novel metal oxides that yield larger reduction extents (practically achievable off-stoichiometries) than the state-of-the-art CeO<sub>2</sub> is critical. Here, we explore the chemical space of Ca–Ce–M–O (M = 3d transition metal, except Cu and Zn) metal oxide perovskites, with Ca and/or Ce occupying the A site and M occupying the B site within an ABO<sub>3</sub> framework, as potential STC candidates. We use density functional theory (DFT)-based calculations and systematically evaluate the oxygen vacancy (VaO) formation energy (≈ enthalpy of reduction in an STC cycle), electronic properties, thermodynamic stability of CaMO<sub>3</sub>, CeMO<sub>3</sub>, and Ca<sub>0.5</sub>Ce<sub>0.5</sub>MO<sub>3</sub> perovskites, and the VaO formation energy within Ca<sub>0.5</sub>Ce<sub>0.5</sub>Ti<sub>0.5</sub>Mg<sub>0.5</sub>O<sub>3</sub> perovskite. We consider only Ca and/or Ce on the A site because of their similar size and the potential redox activity of Ce<sup>4+</sup>. If both Ce and M exhibit simultaneous reduction with Va<sub>O</sub> formation, the resulting perovskite could exhibit a larger entropy of reduction than a single cation reduction. The increased entropy produces increased reduction for fixed temperature, partial pressure of oxygen, and reduction enthalpy, and therefore increased STC efficiency. Importantly, we identify Ca<sub>0.5</sub>Ce<sub>0.5</sub>MnO<sub>3</sub>, Ca<sub>0.5</sub>Ce<sub>0.5</sub>FeO<sub>3</sub>, and Ca<sub>0.5</sub>Ce<sub>0.5</sub>VO<sub>3</sub> to be promising candidates based on their Va<sub>O</sub> formation energy and thermodynamic (meta)stability. Moreover, based on our calculated on-site magnetic moments, electron density of states, and electron density differences between pristine and defective structures, we find Ca<sub>0.5</sub>Ce<sub>0.5</sub>MnO<sub>3</sub> to exhibit simultaneous reduction of both Ce<sup>4+</sup> (A-site) and Mn<sup>3+</sup> (B-site), highlighting a particularly promising candidate for STC applications with a predicted higher entropy of reduction than CeO<sub>2</sub>. Lastly, we extract metrics that govern the trends in Va<sub>O</sub> formation energies, such as standard reduction potentials, and provide pointers for further experimental and theoretical studies, which will enable the design of improved materials for the STC cycle.","American Chemical Society (ACS)","","Princeton Univ., NJ (United States)","USDOE Office of Energy Efficiency and Renewable Energy (EERE)","","United States","2020-11-17T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: Chemistry of Materials; Journal Volume: 32; Journal Issue: 23","","Medium: ED; Size: p. 9964-9982","","","EE0008090","Journal ID: ISSN 0897-4756","10.1021/acs.chemmater.0c02912","","2021-11-17T00:00:00Z","1806574","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/1806574","https://www.osti.gov/servlets/purl/1806574","Chemistry of Materials","23","32"

This study performs the first analysis of annual performance for a novel OSWEC with geometry control to understand how the geometry control affects availability, annual power generation, and structural loadings like the power-take-off (PTO) torque or surge foundation force. Device hydrodynamic coefficients are calculated using linear potential theory for six geometry configurations. A nonideal PTO system is assumed and quadratic viscous damping losses are considered. Annual performance is evaluated and compared for three U.S. wave energy sites. The WEC geometry and PTO system are controlled on a sea-state basis to optimize for power capture while remaining under limits set on motion amplitude and structural loads. Results indicate that geometry control can increase availability up to 25 days in an average year depending on design limits, increase average power generation, and significantly reduce peak structural loads.","Elsevier","","National Renewable Energy Lab.

Embedded multireference second-order perturbation theory (emb-MRPT2) based on reference wavefunctions generated via embedded complete active space self-consistent field (emb-CASSCF) theory is currently state-of-the-art. However, the factorial scaling of CASSCF limits the size of active space and the complexity of systems that can be studied. In this work, we assess the efficacy of an alternative CW method, adaptive sampling configuration interaction (ASCI)–which enables large active spaces to be used–for studying surface reactions. We couple ASCI with density functional embedding theory (DFET) and benchmark its performance for two reactions: H<sub>2</sub> desorption from and CH<sub>4</sub> dissociation on the Cu(111) surface. Unlike embedded complete active space second-order perturbation theory (emb-CASPT2) that accurately reproduces a measured H<sub>2</sub> desorption barrier, embedded ASCI, using a very large active space (though one that still comprises a small portion of the full set of orbitals) fails to do so. Adding an extra correlation term from embedded Møller–Plesset second-order perturbation theory (emb-MP2) improves the desorption barrier and endothermicity predictions. Thus, the inaccuracy of embedded ASCI comes from the missing dynamic correlation from the many other electrons and orbitals not included in the active space. For CH<sub>4</sub> dissociation, again embedded ASCI overestimates the dissociation barrier compared to emb-CASPT2 predictions. Adding dynamic correlation from emb-MP2 helps correct the barrier. However, this composite approach suffers from double counting of correlation within embedded ASCI followed by emb-MP2 calculations. We therefore conclude that the state-of-the-art emb-MRPT2 based on reference wavefunctions generated via emb-CASSCF remains the method of choice for studying surface reactions. emb-ASCI is useful when large active spaces beyond the limit of emb-CASSCF are essential, such as to study complex surface reactions with significant multiconfigurational character (static correlation) but weak dynamic correlation.","American Chemical Society","","Princeton Univ., NJ (United States)","USDOE Office of Science (SC), Basic Energy Sciences (BES)","","United States","2020-10-20T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: Journal of Chemical Theory and Computation; Journal Volume: 16; Journal Issue: 11","","Medium: ED; Size: p. 7078-7088","","","AC02-05CH11231","Journal ID: ISSN 1549-9618; TRN: US2212916","10.1021/acs.jctc.0c00341","","2022-09-29T00:00:00Z","1808600","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/1808600","https://www.osti.gov/servlets/purl/1808600","Journal of Chemical Theory and Computation","11","16"

Here we show that the acidity scale for binary oxides is a powerful descriptor for tuning and predicting oxygen surface exchange kinetics on mixed conducting oxides. By infiltrating a selection of binary oxides from strongly basic (Li<sub>2</sub>O) to strongly acidic (SiO<sub>2</sub>) onto the surface of Pr<sub>0.1</sub>Ce<sub>0.9</sub>O<sub>2-δ</sub> samples, it was possible to vary the chemical surface exchange coefficient k<sub>chem</sub> by 6 orders of magnitude, with basic oxides such as Li<sub>2</sub>O increasing k<sub>chem</sub> by nearly 1,000 times, with surface concentrations as low as 50 ppm impacting k<sub>chem</sub>. Strikingly, although the pre-exponential of k<sub>chem</sub> scales linearly with the acidity of the infiltrated binary oxide, there is nearly no change in the activation energy.

The NACA-63(4)-24 hydrofoil profile in the original RM1 design is replaced with a NACA-4415 profile to minimize the Reynolds dependency of lift and drag characteristics at the test chord Reynolds number. Precise blade angular position and torque measurements were synchronized with three acoustic Doppler velocimeters (ADV) aligned with each rotor centerline and the midpoint between the rotor axes. Flow conditions for each case were controlled to maintain a hub height velocity, uhub= 1.04 ms-1, a flow Reynolds number, ReD= 4.4 × 105, and a blade chord length Reynolds number, Rec= 3.1 × 105. Performance was measured for a range of tip-speed ratios by varying rotor angular velocity. Peak power coefficients, CP= 0.48 (right rotor) and CP= 0.43 (left rotor), were observed at a tip speed ratio, λ= 5.1. Vertical velocity profiles collected in the wake of each rotor between 1 and 10 rotor diameters are used to estimate the turbulent flow recovery in the wake, as well as the interaction of the counter-rotating rotor wakes. The observed performance characteristics of the dual rotor configuration in the present study are found to be similar to those for single rotor investigations in other studies. Similarities between dual and single rotor far-wake characteristics are also observed.","MDPI AG","","Sandia National Lab.

The dosages of H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub>, ethanol, and pretreatment temperature were optimized, and the results revealed that a maximum lignin removal as high as 79.25% could be achieved at only 100 °C, 3 wt% H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> concentration and 1 wt% ethanol concentration. Meanwhile, 76.5% of glucan and 56.0% of xylan were preserved at this pretreatment condition. By overcoming the delignification saturation point, enzymatic hydrolysis efficiency was remarkably enhanced, achieving 96.76% and 97.38% of glucan and xylan conversion, respectively, which are 7.4 and 11.4 times as compared to that of the untreated bamboo. Furthermore, the simultaneous saccharification and fermentation (SSF) result indicated an identical ethanol yield of ~75% when elevating the SSF solid loading from 5% to 30%. Based on the sequential SSF and xylose fermentation results, about 5.6 tons of bamboo would be consumed to produce 1 ton of ethanol. Finally, the energy balance revealed that a positive balance of 1255.4 KJ could be generated via processing 1 kg bamboo.

Colloidal growth techniques, such as antisolvent precipitation, forms colloidal dispersions with properties that match bulk layered R-P phases, but controlling the composition of these particles remains challenging. Here, we explore the microstructure of particles of R-P phases of methylammonium lead iodide prepared by antisolvent precipitation from ternary mixtures of alkylammonium cations, where one cation can form perovskite phases (CH<sub>3</sub>NH<sub>3</sub><sup>+</sup>) and the other two promote layered structures as spacers (e.g. C<sub>4</sub>H<sub>9</sub>NH<sub>3</sub><sup>+</sup> and C<sub>12</sub>H<sub>25</sub>NH<sub>3</sub><sup>+</sup>). We determine that alkylammonium spacers pack with constant methylene density in the R-P interlayer, and exclude interlayer solvent in dispersed colloids, regardless of length or branching. Using this result, we illustrate how the competition between cations that act as spacers between layers, or as grain- terminating ligands, determines the colloidal microstructure of layered R-P crystallites in solution. Optical measurements reveal that quantum well dimensions can be tuned by engineering the ternary cation composition. Transmission synchrotron wide-angle X-ray scattering and small angle neutron scattering reveal changes in the structure of colloids in solvent and after deposition into thin films. In particular, we find that spacers can alloy between R-P layers if they share common steric arrangements, but tend to segregate into polydisperse R-P phases if they do not mix. In conclusion, this study provides a framework to compare the microstructure of colloidal layered perovskites and suggests clear avenues to control phase and colloidal morphology.","American Chemical Society (ACS)","","Univ. of California, Santa Barbara, CA (United States)","USDOE Office of Science (SC), Basic Energy Sciences (BES)","","United States","2020-08-24T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: ACS Nano; Journal Volume: 14; Journal Issue: 9","","Medium: ED; Size: p. 11294-11308","","","SC0012541; AC02-76SF00515","Journal ID: ISSN 1936-0851","10.1021/acsnano.0c03219","","2021-08-25T00:00:00Z","1712683","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/1712683","https://www.osti.gov/servlets/purl/1712683","ACS Nano","9","14"

However, the insufficient durability issue of PtM is often raised because of the fast dissolution of M in acid, impeding their commercialization. Herein, we report on a Ketjenblack (KB)-supported, nitrogen (N)-doped intermetallic PtNiN (Int-PtNiN/KB) catalyst that exhibits remarkably enhanced ORR activity and stability in an acidic electrolyte, superior to those of disordered PtNi/KB, disordered PtNiN/KB, and commercial Pt/C. The experimental results show that Int-PtNiN/KB has a distinctive ordering structure of alternating Ni4-N and Pt planes; we attribute the origin of the superior stability of this catalyst to the combined effect of the Ni4-N formation and the unique intermetallic structure, which effectively precludes Ni dissolution from the core. The density functional theory calculations suggest that the tensile strain introduced by the formation of an intermetallic phase and N-doping optimizes the binding of oxygenated species on the Pt surface and enable highly efficient electron transfer, leading to the enhanced ORR performance. This study offers an appropriate route for further enhancing both the activity and durability of PtM catalysts through a facile synthesis method by annealing in an NH3 gas under appropriate conditions.","American Chemical Society (ACS)","","Brookhaven National Lab.

Here, we consider the CO reduction step on Cu(111), which is critical to understanding reaction selectivity. Here, we optimize embedding potentials at the periodic plane-wave DFT level using density functional embedding theory (DFET). All possible adsorption sites (adsites) for each adsorbate then are screened with ECW theory at the catalytically active site to refine the local electronic structure. Unsurprisingly, DFT and ECW theory predict different adsite preferences, largely because of DFT’s inability to properly situate the CO 2π* level. Differing preferred adsites suggest that different reaction pathways could emerge from DFT versus ECW theory. Starting from these preferred ECW theory adsites, we then obtain reaction pathways at the plane-wave DFT level using the climbing-image nudged elastic band method to determine minimum energy paths. Thereafter, we perform ECW calculations at the catalytically active site to correct the energetics at each interpolated structure (image) along the reaction pathways. Via this approach, we confirm that the first step in CO reduction via hydrogen transfer on Cu(111) is to form hydroxymethylidyne (*COH) instead of formyl (*CHO). Although the prediction to preferentially form *COH is consistent with that of DFT, the two theories predict quite different structural and mechanistic behaviors, suggesting that verification is needed for other parts of the mechanism of CO<sub>2</sub> reduction, which is the subject of ongoing work.","American Chemical Society","","Princeton Univ., NJ (United States)","USDOE Office of Science (SC), Basic Energy Sciences (BES)","","United States","2020-08-20T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: Journal of Chemical Theory and Computation; Journal Volume: 16; Journal Issue: 10","","Medium: ED; Size: p. 6528-6538","","","AC02-05CH11231","Journal ID: ISSN 1549-9618; TRN: US2204558","10.1021/acs.jctc.0c00583","","2022-08-04T00:00:00Z","1704062","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/1704062","https://www.osti.gov/servlets/purl/1704062","Journal of Chemical Theory and Computation","10","16"

For example, transition-metal and rare-earth oxides that can tolerate a large number of oxygen vacancies, such as CeO<sub>2</sub> and doped CeO<sub>2</sub>, can split water and carbon dioxide via a two-step, oxide-based solar thermochemical (STC) cycle. The search for new STC materials with a performance superior to that of state-of-the-art CeO<sub>2</sub> can benefit from predictions accurately describing the thermodynamics of oxygen vacancies. The sub-lattice formalism, a common tool used to fit experimental data and build temperature-composition phase diagrams, can be useful in this context. Here, sub-lattice models are derived solely from zero-temperature quantum mechanics calculations to estimate fairly accurate temperature- and oxygen-partial-pressure-dependent off-stoichiometries in CeO<sub>2</sub> and Zr-doped CeO<sub>2</sub>. Physical motivations for deriving some of the “excess” sub-lattice model parameters directly from quantum mechanical calculations, instead of fitting to minimize deviations from experimental and/or theoretical data, are identified. As a result, important limitations and approximations of the approach used are specified and extensions to multi-cation oxides are also suggested to help identify novel candidates for water and carbon dioxide splitting and related applications.","Wiley","","Princeton Univ., NJ (United States)","USDOE Office of Energy Efficiency and Renewable Energy (EERE)","","United States","2020-08-17T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: Advanced Theory and Simulations; Journal Volume: 3; Journal Issue: 9","","Medium: ED; Size: Article No. 2000112","","","EE0008090","Journal ID: ISSN 2513-0390","10.1002/adts.202000112","","2021-08-17T00:00:00Z","1808710","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/1808710","https://www.osti.gov/servlets/purl/1808710","Advanced Theory and Simulations","9","3"

Despite inherently fast photocarrier decay in neat 2D TMDCs, the unique photophysics in these quantum-confined systems motivates continued effort to control the evolution of photoexcited states and create functional devices. Here, an intriguing strategy to accomplish this goal is to employ TMDCs in heterojunctions with appropriate semiconductors, where energy level offsets drive photoinduced charge transfer (PCT) across material interfaces. PCT in TMDC-based systems can be optimized for many different applications, such as driving free carriers to photocatalytic sites for redox reactions like water splitting, extracting charge to perform work in photovoltaics or photodetectors, and manipulating the spin and momentum valley electronic degrees of freedom for quantum computing systems. Here, we review recent strides in optimizing PCT for such applications through greater fundamental understanding of the photophysics that occurs at TMDC/semiconductor interfaces. After giving an overview of isolated TMDC properties, synthetic methods, and the basics of PCT, we discuss TMDCs in heterojunctions with several classes of materials, including other TMDCs, small molecule semiconductors, polymers, single-walled carbon nanotubes, quantum dots, perovskites, and electrolytes. In addition to highlighting the unique benefits of each materials category, we also identify parallels across common themes, such as the roles of charge-transfer states, spin, electronic coupling, delocalization, interfacial atomic morphology, and the precise design of energy landscapes to direct charge and energy motion. We hope to capture a broad range of the valuable work in this fast-paced field to inspire new research directions for employing PCT in targeted TMDC-based systems.","Royal Society of Chemistry","","National Renewable Energy Lab.

"A novel triple power cycle featuring a gas turbine cycle with supercritical carbon dioxide and organic Rankine cycles: Thermoeconomic analysis and optimization","Mohammadi, Kasra; Ellingwood, Kevin; Powell, Kody","30 DIRECT ENERGY CONVERSION; Gas turbine cycle; Triple cycle; Supercritical carbon dioxide power cycle; Organic Rankine cycle; Thermoeconomic analysis; Particle swarm optimization","In this study, a novel triple power cycle is proposed where waste heat from a gas turbine cycle is utilized to drive a supercritical carbon dioxide (s-CO<sub>2</sub>) recompression cycle and a recuperative organic Rankine cycle (ORC) in sequence. A detailed thermoeconomic model is developed and implemented in MATLAB to evaluate the performance of the proposed cycle under different operating conditions. Optimization using a particle swarm optimization (PSO) algorithm is performed to minimize the levelized cost of electricity (LCOE) and determine the optimum design conditions of the cycle. The optimization results show that for a 100 MW cycle, the overall thermal efficiency and LCOE are 0.521 and $\$52.819$/MWh, respectively. The turbine inlet temperature of the gas turbine and s-CO<sub>2</sub> cycles are found as the most influential parameters on the thermoeconomic performance of the triple cycle. The proposed triple cycle shows an excellent waste energy recovery potential and superiority over a very thermodynamically efficient cycle from the literature, which included a gas turbine topping cycle and a complex cascade s-CO<sub>2</sub> power cycle used a bottoming cycle. As a result, the proposed triple cycle shows up to 0.9% points higher efficiency while it has fewer heat exchangers and turbomachinery than the cycle from the literature.","Elsevier","","Univ. of Utah, Salt Lake City, UT (United States)","USDOE Office of Energy Efficiency and Renewable Energy (EERE)","","United States","2020-07-01T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: Energy Conversion and Management; Journal Volume: 220","","Medium: ED; Size: Article No. 113123","","","EE0007712","Journal ID: ISSN 0196-8904","10.1016/j.enconman.2020.113123","","2022-06-29T00:00:00Z","1864039","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/1864039","https://www.osti.gov/servlets/purl/1864039","Energy Conversion and Management","","220"

In this study, an electrochemical cleaning method has been employed to reverse the effects of chromium poisoning. Two cells were fabricated and poisoned under identical conditions by operating them at 800°C in the presence of a Cr source. Both poisoned cells exhibited a significant reduction in maximum power density and an increase in polarization resistance. One of the poisoned cells, designated as the baseline cell, was cooled to room temperature after poisoning. Microstructural observation of the baseline cell showed significant contamination of the cathode active layer by chromium oxide and (Cr,Mn) spinel deposits. The other poisoned cell was electrochemically cleaned for two hours under a mild electrolytic condition. As a result of the electrochemical cleaning process, the chromium oxide deposits were substantially removed leading to a significant reduction of Cr concentration in the cathode, especially at the cathode/electrolyte interface. Furthermore, a substantial fraction of the cell performance loss was also reversed. To the best of our knowledge, this is a first demonstration of reversing the effects of chromium poisoning using a rapid in-situ process.","Elsevier","","Boston Univ., MA (United States)","USDOE Office of Fossil Energy (FE)","","United States","2020-06-28T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: Journal of Power Sources; Journal Volume: 471","","Medium: ED; Size: Article No. 228474","","","FE0031206; FOA-0001735","Journal ID: ISSN 0378-7753","10.1016/j.jpowsour.2020.228474","","2022-01-03T00:00:00Z","1837571","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/1837571","https://www.osti.gov/servlets/purl/1837571","Journal of Power Sources","","471"

Accelerated multizone for engine cycle simulation has the virtue of enabling accurate evaluation of many operating conditions based on thermal stratification data from a single fluid mechanics run at motored conditions. This is possible because thermal stratification is more sensitive to engine geometry than to operating conditions. In this article, accuracy of accelerated multizone for engine cycle simulation is demonstrated by comparison with experimental data for iso-octane homogeneous charge compression ignition operation over a broad range of lean equivalence ratios (0.14–0.28). The validated accelerated multizone for engine cycle simulation model is then applied to generating a performance map for an engine controlled by appropriately adjusting equivalence ratio and internal exhaust gas recirculation. Regions of acceptable and optimum combustion are identified. It is finally demonstrated that while indicated mean effective pressure remains low for optimum homogeneous charge compression ignition operation (1–4 bar), this is sufficient for a large fraction of typical driving in light-duty vehicles. Much driving including idle can therefore be done in homogeneous charge compression ignition mode at high efficiency and low (essentially zero) NOx and particulate matter emissions.","SAGE","External Audience (Unlimited)","Lawrence Livermore National Lab.

Here, we first review the achievement in active and stable Pt ML on palladium (Pd) nanoparticle catalysts for the ORR. We then describe the mechanisms that rationalize their high activity and durability. Recently, we developed several novel nanostructured cores to further improve the ORR activity and stability by optimizing their surface orientation, composition, and morphology. The results from the Pt ML catalysts significantly impact the research of electrocatalysis and fuel-cell technology, as they demonstrate an exceptionally effective way of design and syntheses of catalysts.","Elsevier","","Brookhaven National Lab.

Some of these properties are measured using contact methods (static contact or intermittent contact), while others are measured using noncontact methods. Some properties can be measured using different approaches. Conductivity, in particular, is mapped using the contact-mode method. However, this modality can be destructive to delicate samples, since it involves continuously dragging the cantilever tip on the surface during the raster scan, while a constant tip–sample force is applied. In this paper we discuss a possible approach to develop an intermittent-contact conductive AFM mode based on Fourier analysis, whereby the measured current response consists of higher harmonics of the cantilever oscillation frequency. Such an approach may enable the characterization of soft samples with less damage than contact-mode imaging. To explore its feasibility, we derive the analytical form of the tip–sample current that would be obtained for attractive (noncontact) and repulsive (intermittent-contact) dynamic AFM characterization, and compare it with results obtained from numerical simulations. Although significant instrumentation challenges are anticipated, the modelling results are promising and suggest that Fourier-based higher-harmonics current measurement may enable the development of a reliable intermittent-contact conductive AFM method.","Beilstein Institute","","George Washington Univ., Washington, DC (United States)","USDOE Office of Science (SC), Basic Energy Sciences (BES)","","United States","2020-03-13T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: Beilstein Journal of Nanotechnology; Journal Volume: 11","","Medium: ED; Size: p. 453-465","","","SC0018041","Journal ID: ISSN 2190-4286; BJNEAH","10.3762/bjnano.11.37","","2020-04-20T00:00:00Z","1603485","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/1603485","https://www.osti.gov/servlets/purl/1603485","Beilstein Journal of Nanotechnology","","11"

A two-step photon-assisted tunneling charge pumping mechanism results in separation of charge carriers in pn-junction wells leading to a large open-circuit voltage developed across a load. Electrical power generation from a broadband blackbody thermal source has been experimentally demonstrated with converted power densities of 27 to 61 microwatts per square centimeter for thermal sources between 250° and 400°C.

This heat engine has been considered for use with conventional concentrating solar power (CSP) systems before. However, unlike previous single-stage devices, the improved design uses two stages with an interstage reheat, allowing more economical and efficient conversion up to 29% at a hot side temperature of 850 °C. Herein, a cost-performance analysis for this improved design assesses opportunities for distributed-CSP in the context of micro-combined heat and power systems. A high-level techno-economic analysis (TEA) is presented that explores four scenarios where a Na-TEC is used as the heat engine for a distributed-CSP system. Overnight capital cost and levelized cost of electricity (LCOE) are estimated for a system lifetime of 30 years, revealing that overnight capital costs in a range from $3.57 to $17.71 per W<sub>e</sub> are feasible, which equate to LCOEs from 6.9 to 17.2 cents kWh<sub>e</sub><sup>-1</sup>. This analysis makes a significant contribution by concurrently quantifying the efficiency and unit costs for a range of multistage configurations, and demonstrating that a Na-TEC may be a promising alternative to Stirling engines for distributed-CSP systems at residential scale of 1–5 kW<sub>e</sub>.","Wiley","","Georgia Institute of Technology, Atlanta, GA (United States)","USDOE Office of Energy Efficiency and Renewable Energy (EERE), Renewable Power Office.

The optimization of such PGM-free electrode structures is often non-linear and iterative, making it a demanding task due to the high number of parameters that affect performance. To accelerate both materials discovery and electrode development, this work demonstrates the application of a high-resolution segmented cell (SC) with 121 segments of 0.413 cm<sup>2</sup> size for combinatorial high-throughput PGM-free catalyst screening and CCL optimization. The approach utilizes three flow-field strips with active areas of 4.45 cm<sup>2</sup> each, distributed over 11 segments. Electrodes with identical catalyst material and fabrication method result in reproducible data with typically less than 10% variation between each segment and match in performance with differential single cell data. High throughput testing of combinatorial sample sets, with varied PGM-free electrocatalyst materials or electrode composition, demonstrated the ability to rapidly discern high performing outliers, and establish or confirm trends in electrode optimization. The results indicated significant performance benefits of electrodes with ionomer content of 45 wt% over lower values, and of water rich inks with 82% water content over those with 50%.","Elsevier","","National Renewable Energy Lab.

In order to reduce the curtailment of renewable energy resources through improving the operational flexibility, a novel optimal scheduling model based on chance-constrained programming (CCP), aiming at minimizing the lowest generation cost, is proposed for a small-scale integrated energy system (IES) with CHP units, thermal power units, renewable generations and representative auxiliary equipments. In this model, due to the uncertainties of renewable generations including wind turbines and photovoltaic units, the probabilistic spinning reserves are supplied in the form of chance-constrained; from the perspective of user experience, a heating load model is built with consideration of heat comfort and inertia in buildings. To solve the model, a solution approach based on sequence operation theory (SOT) is developed, where the original CCP-based scheduling model is tackled into a solvable mixed-integer linear programming (MILP) formulation by converting a chance constraint into its deterministic equivalence class, and thereby is solved via the CPLEX solver. We report the simulation results on the modified IEEE 30-bus system demonstrate that the presented method manages to improve operational flexibility of the IES with uncertain renewable generations by comprehensively leveraging thermal inertia of buildings and different kinds of auxiliary equipments, which provides a fundamental way for promoting renewable energy consumption.","Elsevier","","Argonne National Lab.

This article studies casting irregularities located within the PEM to understand their potential impact on MEA initial performance. Membrane material was cast on a lab-scale polymer casting line operating either within or at the boundaries of the process window. The resulting membrane material was either pristine in the former case, or, in the latter case, contained air bubbles, cracks, and other irregularities, ranging in size from about 0.6 to 3 mm. Spatial polarization experiments were conducted using a 121-channel segmented fuel cell system, and thermal imaging was performed subsequently to map hydrogen crossover to spatial performance. While total-cell polarization data was minimally impacted by the irregularities, the spatial diagnostics showed local performance impacts that, in operation over time, could cause degradation in performance or earlier failure of the MEA. Such impacts could lead to these irregularities being classified as defects, i.e., manufacturing variations that should be identified and not included in a fuel cell stack. Classification of irregularities as defects will ultimately assist the industry by contributing to the development of threshold detection limits for in-line quality control diagnostics.","Elsevier","","National Renewable Energy Lab.

"Effect of Carbon Dioxide Recirculation and Pressure on Efficiency of the TIPS and ENEL Oxy-Coal Power Cycles","Khan, Md. I.; Chowdhury, Mehrin; Chowdhury, A.

The objective of the present study is to perform a parametric analysis, investigating the effect of different recirculation ratios at different pressures on the efficiencies of the cycle named for the company, ENEL, and the thermo energy power system, TIPS, cycles using aspen plus® software. Variables include the flue gas recycle flow rate, the combustor temperature, and the operational pressure. Five recirculation ratios were investigated, ranging from 20% to 75%. It was determined that as the amount of recycled gas into the combustor increased, the thermal efficiency increased for both the TIPS and ENEL cycles. Here, the highest thermal efficiency for TIPS is 37% and for ENEL is 38%, both occurring at a 75% recirculation ratio. After investigation, since combustion temperature and specific heat capacity decreases at higher recirculation ratios, the mass flow rate was the dominant factor that contributes to the increase in thermal efficiency of the cycle. At each recirculation ratio, the effect of pressure is also determined. For ENEL, the increase in cycle efficiency is 10% over the pressure range of 1–12 bar at a recirculation ratio of 20%, while the increase in cycle efficiency is only 1.5% at a higher recirculation ratio of 75%. For TIPS, the cycle efficiency increases by 4% at the recirculation ratio of 20% and increases by 3% at the recirculation ratio of 75% for a pressure range of 50–80 bar.","ASME","","Univ. of Texas at El Paso, TX (United States); University of Texas, El Paso, TX (United States)","USDOE Office of Fossil Energy (FE)","","United States","2019-12-10T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: Journal of Energy Resources Technology; Journal Volume: 142; Journal Issue: 6","","Medium: ED; Size: Article No. 062601","","","FE0029113","Journal ID: ISSN 0195-0738","10.1115/1.4045539","","2023-04-12T00:00:00Z","1867412","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/1867412","https://www.osti.gov/servlets/purl/1867412","Journal of Energy Resources Technology","6","142"

Yet, by breaking the lattice symmetry it is possible to circumvent this limitation. Here, using a unique technique for measuring transient currents upon rapid heating, direct experimental evidence is provided that despite the fact that bulk SrTiO<sub>3</sub> is not pyroelectric, the (100) surface of TiO<sub>2</sub>-terminated SrTiO<sub>3</sub> is intrinsically pyroelectric at room temperature. The pyroelectric layer is found to be ≈1 nm thick and, surprisingly, its polarization is comparable with that of strongly polar materials such as BaTiO<sub>3</sub>. The pyroelectric effect can be tuned ON/OFF by the formation or removal of a nanometric SiO<sub>2</sub> layer. Using density functional theory, the pyroelectricity is found to be a result of polar surface relaxation, which can be suppressed by varying the lattice symmetry breaking using a SiO<sub>2</sub> capping layer. The observation of pyroelectricity emerging at the SrTiO<sub>3</sub> surface also implies that it is intrinsically piezoelectric. Furthermore, these findings may pave the way for observing and tailoring piezo- and pyroelectricity in any material through appropriate breaking of symmetry at surfaces and artificial nanostructures such as heterointerfaces and superlattices.","Wiley","","Univ. of Pennsylvania, Philadelphia, PA (United States)","USDOE Office of Science (SC), Basic Energy Sciences (BES); Independent Research Fund Denmark; Israel Science Foundation (ISF); Harold Perlman Family","Columbia University; Technical University of Denmark; Weizmann Institute of Science; Seton Hall University","United States","2019-09-18T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: Advanced Materials; Journal Volume: 31; Journal Issue: 44","","Medium: ED; Size: Article No. 1904733","","","SC0019281; 6111-00145B","Journal ID: ISSN 0935-9648","10.1002/adma.201904733","","2022-05-30T00:00:00Z","1658241","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/1658241","https://www.osti.gov/servlets/purl/1658241","Advanced Materials","44","31"

Most literature discussion around AEMFC carbonation has hypothesized: (1) that the effect of carbonation is limited to an increase in the Ohmic resistance because carbonate has lower mobility than hydroxide; and/or (2) that the so-called “self-purging” mechanism could effectively decarbonate the cell and eliminate CO<sub>2</sub>-related voltage losses during operation at a reasonable operating current density (>1 A cm<sup>-2</sup>). However, this study definitively shows that neither of these assertions are correct. This work, the first experimental examination of its kind, studies the dynamics of cell carbonation and its effect on AEMFC performance over a wide range of operating currents (0.2–2.0 A cm<sup>-2</sup>), operating temperatures (60–80 °C) and CO<sub>2</sub> concentrations in the reactant gases (5–3200 ppm).

Fuel chemistry is one of several interacting factors that determine the amount of PM produced during combustion. Understanding the relationship between fuel chemistry and PM emissions is therefore essential in identifying fuels with a lower tendency to form soot. However, existing predictive models have been shown to perform poorly when fuel blends include a large proportion of oxygenated molecules. In this study, we report a new analysis of the data from the EPAct V2 data set with the objective of developing an emission index that adequately handles the effects of oxygenate blending on vehicle and engine emissions. Our approach uses regularized linear regression to select the most important parameters in predicting normalized vehicle emissions as a function of fuel composition and bulk fuel properties. Interestingly, our data-derived metric reproduces a similar functional form to the particulate matter index equation, including a chemical tendency to form soot as well as the vapor pressure. The resulting metric better predicts PM formation in the EPAct V2 data set as a function of fuel properties and composition than existing models.","American Chemical Society (ACS)","","National Renewable Energy Lab.

"The impact of thermoelectric leg geometries on thermal resistance and power output","Thimont, Yohann; LeBlanc, Saniya","30 DIRECT ENERGY CONVERSION","Thermoelectric devices enable direct, solid-state conversion of heat to electricity and vice versa. Rather than designing the shape of thermoelectric units or legs to maximize this energy conversion, the cuboid shape of these legs has instead remained unchanged in large part because of limitations in the standard manufacturing process. However, the advent of additive manufacturing (a technique in which freeform geometries are built up layer-by-layer) offers the potential to create unique thermoelectric leg geometries designed to optimize device performance. This work explores this new realm of novel leg geometry by simulating the thermal and electrical performance of various leg geometries such as prismatic, hollow, and layered structures. The simulations are performed for two materials, a standard bismuth telluride material found in current commercial modules and a higher manganese silicide material proposed for low cost energy conversion in high-temperature applications. The results include the temperature gradient and electrical potential developed across individual thermoelectric legs as well as thermoelectric modules with 16 legs. Even simple hollow and layered leg geometries result in larger temperature gradients and higher output powers than the traditional cuboid structure. As a result, the clear dependence of thermal resistance and power output on leg geometry provides compelling motivation to explore additive manufacturing of thermoelectric devices.","American Institute of Physics (AIP)","","George Washington Univ., Washington, DC (United States)","USDOE National Nuclear Security Administration (NNSA), Office of Defense Programs (DP)","","United States","2019-09-03T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: Journal of Applied Physics; Journal Volume: 126; Journal Issue: 9","","Medium: ED; Size: Article No. 095101","","","NA0003858","Journal ID: ISSN 0021-8979; TRN: US2001046","10.1063/1.5115044","","2020-09-04T00:00:00Z","1566136","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/1566136","https://www.osti.gov/servlets/purl/1566136","Journal of Applied Physics","9","126"

The temperature distribution is non-uniform throughout the process. In addition, a series of pore-scale analyses are provided to clarify the relation between the temperature distribution and electrochemical reaction area. More interestingly, the rapid heat generation areas are found to be in a good agreement with the electrochemical reaction areas, which confirms that the heat is released during the reaction processes.

"Towards quantitative prediction of ignition-delay-time sensitivity on fuel-to-air equivalence ratio","Messerly, Richard; Rahimi, Mohammad J.; St. John, Peter C.; Luecke, Jon H.; Park, Ji-Woong; Huq, Nabila A.; Foust, Thomas D.; Lu, Tianfeng; Zigler, Bradley T.; McCormick, Robert L.; Kim, Seon Ah","30 DIRECT ENERGY CONVERSION; ..phi..-sensitivity; kinetic mechanisms; machine learning; uncertainty quantification, OPPL","Several compression-ignition and low-temperature combustion strategies require a fuel where the ignition-delay-time (IDT) is highly sensitive to the fuel-to-air equivalence ratio (Φ). Quantitative prediction of Φ sensitivity (i.e., the change in IDT with respect to Φ) would enable rapid screening of the numerous possible (bio)fuel candidates for this desired high Φ-sensitivity characteristic. We propose a new Φ-sensitivity metric (η), which is primarily a function of only temperature (T) and pressure (P). We assess the reliability of 0-D (perfectly homogeneous) simulation and state-of-the-art reaction mechanisms for two well-studied fuels, namely, iso-octane and a primary reference fuel (PRF80). 0-D simulation results are in good agreement with experimental constant volume IDT data at low- and intermediate-temperatures, while systematic deviations are observed at higher temperatures (where full 3-D computational fluid dynamics simulations are required for accurate prediction). We also perform a traditional single-parameter sensitivity analysis to determine the key reactions that affect ..phi..sensitivity. This is followed by a more rigorous Bayesian uncertainty quantification (UQ) analysis to elucidate the possible sources for the discrepancies at high T. Due to the computational cost of UQ, we train artificial neural networks to rapidly predict η for randomly perturbed sets of low- and intermediatetemperature reaction rate parameters. The primary implications of this study are that experimental ..phi..-sensitivity data can be used to refine and validate proposed reaction mechanisms, while machine learning and uncertainty quantification of 0-D simulations are essential for quantitative prediction of Φ-sensitivity in order to rapidly screen fuel candidates.","Elsevier","","National Renewable Energy Lab.

"Experimental and numerical investigation of the Advanced Fuel Ignition Delay Analyzer (AFIDA) constant-volume combustion chamber as a research platform for fuel chemical kinetic mechanism validation","Luecke, Jon; Rahimi, Mohammad; Zigler, Bradley; Grout, Ray","30 DIRECT ENERGY CONVERSION; constant volume combustion chamber; fuel; CFD; ignition delay; chemical kinetic mechanism; AFIDA","Advanced combustion engine strategies that can offer increased efficiency and reduced emissions are enabled by numerical engine combustion simulations, requiring accurate chemical kinetic mechanism input. The Advanced Fuel Ignition Delay Analyzer (AFIDA) device can perform high quality, repeatable measurements of ignition delay (ID) times using small fuel quantities with high throughput. The AFIDA experiments involve liquid fuel injection into the heated and pressurized constant-volume chamber, producing an autoignition delay resulting from a combination of physical mixing and chemical kinetic processes, a complexity which makes the development of complementary numerical models necessary for the development and validation of chemical kinetic mechanisms. Modeling the device based on a homogenous approximation with reduced primary reference fuel (PRF) mechanism shows up to 75% error in the modeled vs. observed autoignition delay data for n-heptane and iso-octane at 10 bar (..phi.. = 1.2-0.8) and 20 bar (..phi.. = 0.6-0.4) over 973-648 K, whereas the use of a computational fluid dynamics (CFD) model reduces the discrepancy to within 25%. The homogenous approximation error is greatest for conditions where the observed ignition delay is short and the system is not sufficiently mixed (<30 ms), providing guidance to select a homogenous reactor vs. CFD modeling approach based upon desired accuracy. Experimental 20 bar iso-octane ID results show a larger magnitude of negative temperature coefficient chemistry compared to numerical results, indicating possible deficiencies in the PRF chemical kinetic mechanism. This characterization demonstrates the AFIDA as a capable research platform for chemical kinetic model development and validation.","Elsevier","","National Renewable Energy Lab.

Now we report that the rear mirror can be used to create thermophotovoltaic systems with unprecedented high thermophotovoltaic efficiency. This mirror reflects low-energy infrared photons back into the heat source, recovering their energy. Therefore, the rear mirror serves a dual function; boosting the voltage and reusing infrared thermal photons. This allows the possibility of a practical >50% efficient thermophotovoltaic system.

Theoretical considerations, assumptions, and future applications of the methodology are discussed. The method is demonstrated on catalyst layers fabricated from a commercially available PGM-free oxygen reduction catalyst. Effective diffusivity measurements using hydrogen were made which were then used to estimate the effective diffusivity of air of the full layer without the confounding effect of electrode flooding. This method complements alternative techniques such as mercury porosimetry or x-ray computed tomography and can be easily adopted by research groups everywhere to study MEA-level properties of PGM-free catalyst layers and accelerate the development and deployment of PGM-free PEFCs.","Elsevier","","National Renewable Energy Lab.

However, a limited amount of this development and understanding has been undertaken using operando electrochemical diagnostics at the membrane electrode assembly (MEA) level. In this work, the operando ORR kinetics on an atomically dispersed iron-nitrogen-carbon ((AD)Fe-N-C) PGM-free electrocatalyst have been examined to extract the reaction order and the activation energy of the ORR. The experiments were carefully designed to ensure the stability/predictability of the electrocatalyst during the data collection process and thus validate the relevance of the values obtained for the aforementioned parameters. A kinetic model that considers a potential-dependent availability of active sites (..theta..) is proposed. Active site availability is shown to be a function of both the change in the oxidation state (nR) and the redox potential at which the metal center transitions from a higher oxidation state to a lower one (ER). The resulting model fitting parameters for nR and (0.71 and 0.788 V, respectively) obtained from the analysis of operando data correlate well with those from in situ X-ray absorption near edge structure measurements (nR = 0.57) and in situ cyclic voltammetry measurements (0.75 V < ER < 0.8 V) in the MEA environment. The resulting model provides an excellent fit of MEA performance across the range of pressures, temperatures, and potentials under which the data were collected.","Elsevier","","Oak Ridge National Lab.

Until today, no other existing techniques can determine the number of lifted bond wires and their locations in a live IGBT module. Through this paper, a new method for online condition monitoring of IGBTs and IGBT modules using SSTDR has been proposed. Unlike traditional methods, this research work concentrates at the gate terminals of the device instead of looking at the collector side. In addition, the RL-equivalent circuit to represent a bond wire has been developed for the DUT and simulated in CST Studio Suite to measure the reflection amplitudes. Both the experimental and simulation results have been compared. These results prove that a single measurement is sufficient to predict the failure of the device instead of looking at the traditional precursor parameter.

RPL, the IPv6 routing standard for low-power and lossy networks, tried to achieve this goal but has not seen wide adoption in practice. As an alternative, Thread is a recently standardized low-power network protocol for IoT, driven by the Thread group, an industry consortium led by Google/Nest. Here, we provide a comparative analysis of the technical aspects of RPL and Thread based on their specifications, explaining why using Thread, as opposed to RPL, may make sense for the future Internet. Specifically, the fundamental differences between RPL and Thread are their respective scopes and multihop network architectures, which result in Thread's unique design and advantages over RPL. Lastly, we evaluate Thread in an indoor multihop wireless testbed using OpenThread, an official open source implementation of Thread.

In this study, we demonstrate that increasing the roughness factor of Cu electrodes is an effective design principle to direct the selectivity of CO reduction towards multicarbon oxygenates at low overpotentials and concurrently suppressing hydrocarbon and hydrogen production.

This high QY was achieved by using highly purified lead and thiourea precursors. This QY is 2.6 times higher than from NCs prepared with commercially available lead and sulfide precursors. Transient absorption spectroscopy reveals two reasons for the enhanced QY: longer intrinsic exciton lifetimes of PbS NCs and the ability to support a longer triplet lifetime for the surface-bound transmitter molecule.

Coupling the in situ diagnostic data with ex situ characterization of catalyst inks and electrode structures, the effect of ink composition is explained by both ink-level interactions that dictate the electrode microstructure during fabrication and the resulting local ionomer distribution near catalyst sites. Electrochemical techniques (CO displacement and ac impedance) show that catalyst inks with higher water content increase ionomer (sulfonate) interactions with Pt sites without significantly affecting ionomer coverage on the carbon support. Surprisingly, the higher anion adsorption is shown to have a minor impact on specific activity, while exhibiting a complex relationship with oxygen transport. Ex situ characterization of ionomer suspensions and catalyst/ionomer inks indicates that the lower ionomer coverage can be correlated with the formation of large ionomer aggregates and weaker ionomer/catalyst interactions in low-water content inks. These larger ionomer aggregates resulted in increased local oxygen transport resistance, namely, through the ionomer film, and reduced performance at high current density. In the water-rich inks, the ionomer aggregate size decreases, while stronger ionomer/Pt interactions are observed. The reduced ionomer aggregation improves transport resistance through the ionomer film, while the increased adsorption leads to the emergence of resistance at the ionomer/Pt interface. Overall, the high current density performance is shown to be a nonmonotonic function of ink water content, scaling with the local gas (H2, O2) transport resistance resulting from pore, thin film, and interfacial phenomena.","American Chemical Society (ACS)","","National Renewable Energy Lab.

Obtaining fundamental insights into the ongoing structural and compositional changes of electrocatalysts is crucial for not only transitioning an electrode from its as-prepared to functional state, also known as 'conditioning', but also for establishing intrinsic electrochemical performances. Here, we investigated several oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) electrocatalysts via in situ and ex situ characterization techniques to provide fundamental insights into the interfacial phenomena that enable peak ORR mass activity and high current density performance. A mechanistic understanding of a fuel cell conditioning procedure is described, which encompasses voltage cycling and subsequent voltage recovery (VR) steps at low potential. In particular, ex situ membrane electrode assembly characterization using transmission electron microscopy and ultra-small angle X-ray scattering were performed to determine changes in carbon and Pt particle size and morphology, while in situ electrochemical diagnostics were performed either during or after specific points in the testing protocol to determine the electrochemical and interfacial changes occurring on the catalyst surface responsible for oxygen transport resistances through ionomer films. The results demonstrate that the voltage cycling (break-in) step aids in the removal of sulfate and fluoride and concomitantly reduces non-Fickian oxygen transport resistances, especially for catalysts where Pt is located within the pores of the carbon support. Subsequent low voltage holds at low temperature and oversaturated conditions, i.e., VR cycles, serve to improve mass activities by a factor of two to three, through a combined removal of contaminants, surface-blocking species (e.g., oxides), and rearrangement of the catalyst atomic structure (e.g., Pt-Pt and Pt-Co coordination).","American Chemical Society (ACS)","","National Renewable Energy Lab.

Uncoordinated PEV charging may increase electricity demand during peak hours, which could create concerns for the grid as the number of PEVs increases. Therefore, it is important to coordinate charging to alleviate potential negative impacts. Centralized charging coordination is preferred by grid operator over distributed control strategies because it can systematically allocate energy across a large population of PEVs and achieve global coordination benefits. However, centralized methods presented in the literature to date require prohibitively expensive computational resources and lack realistic PEV charging models. As a result, they cannot achieve the efficiency and accuracy required to implement charging coordination in the real world. This paper introduces a highly efficient receding horizon control framework that enables dynamic charging coordination for large PEV populations. A two-stage hierarchical optimization routine is proposed that aggregates individual PEV charging flexibility to reduce the computational complexity of the optimization process. The control framework is based on high-fidelity, validated charging system models and charging behavior models derived from a real-world data set of residential charging activities collected from thousands of charging stations over multiple years. Case studies illustrate that the proposed charging control framework is capable of effectively coordinating the charging of millions of PEVs using a standard desktop computer.","","","National Renewable Energy Lab.

However, in this case, mass diffusion issues are brought in when some of the pores are covered by the flow field lands or shoulders. The coverage of the pores can lead to very high transport resistance, which may reduce the number of active oxygen evolution reaction sites, and therefore lower down the PEMEC performance. The in-plane transport enhancement layer for TT-LGDLs/PTLs are proposed to develop a dual-layer LGDL/PTL structure for improving the mass diffusion and the PEMEC performance. The results of this research reveal that the dual-layer LGDL/PTL structure exhibits smaller ohmic resistance and mass transport resistance, and therefore improve the PEMEC performance, without obvious changes in kinetic losses. The total ohmic resistance and mass transport resistance can be reduced by about 23% and 41%, respectively, with an ~830 um pore TT-LGDL/PTL stacking on a ~100 um pore TT-LGDL/PTL. The results indicate the feasibility of stacking the in-plane transport enhancement layer with large pore sizes onto a small pore TT-LGDLs/PTLs for high efficiency and low cost PEMEC practical applications.","Elsevier","","National Renewable Energy Lab.

The promise of PEFC-based fuel cell electric vehicles (FCEVs) as long range EVs of zero emissions, high conversion efficiency, and fit for use of fuels from renewable sources, was recognized by pioneers of this technology some 40 years ago, facing at the time significant skepticism. The eventual commercial introduction of FCEVs in 2015 was enabled by the impressive accomplishments of scientists, engineers, and policymakers over that period of time. Among those responsible for the fuel cell community's success, few, if any, have had more impact than Dr. Shimshon Gottesfeld. He is a distinguished fuel cell educator, a passionate fuel cell and alternative fuel advocate, and a pioneering fuel cell innovator, responsible for several critical contributions that helped demonstrate the commercial viability of polymer electrolyte fuel cells. His impact on the field is seen through specific technical accomplishments, the scientists he has mentored, the teams he has led in different topical areas, and his activities as organizer and speaker in technical fuel cell meetings. We are honored to dedicate this focus issue of the Journal of The Electrochemical Society, entitled 'Advances in Modern Polymer Electrolyte Fuel Cells in Honor of Shimshon Gottesfeld,' to Dr. Gottesfeld for his accomplishments in the area of PEFC science and technology.","","","National Renewable Energy Lab.

To this end, this study investigates the feasibility of a novel integrated package assembly, which consists of copper circuit layer on an aluminum nitride (AlN) dielectric layer that is bonded to an aluminum silicon carbide (AlSiC) substrate. The entire assembly possesses a low coefficient of thermal expansion (CTE) mismatch which aids in the thermal cycling reliability of the structure. The new assembly can serve as a replacement for the conventionally used direct bonded copper (DBC) - Cu base plate - Al heat sink assembly. While improvements in thermal cycling stability of more than a factor of 18 has been demonstrated, the use of AlSiC can result in increased thermal resistance when compared to thick copper heat spreaders. To address this issue, we demonstrate that the integration of single phase liquid cooling in the AlSiC layer can result in improved thermal performance, matching that of copper heat spreading layers. This is aided by the use of heat transfer enhancement features built into the AlSiC layer. It is found that, for a given pumping power and through analytical optimization of geometries, either microchannels, pin fins and jets can be designed to yield a heat transfer coefficients of up to 65000 W m<sup>-2</sup> K<sup>-1</sup>, which can result in competitive device temperatures as Cu-baseplate designs, but with added reliability.","ASME","","National Renewable Energy Lab.

"Evolution of Ionomer Morphology from Dispersion to Film: An in Situ X-ray Study","Dudenas, Peter J.; Kusoglu, Ahmet","30 DIRECT ENERGY CONVERSION; Morphology; Thin films; Hydrophilicity; Solvents; Ionomers","Ion-conducting polymers (ionomers) have been extensively studied in solution, as membranes and substrate-supported thin films for various electrochemical energy-conversion devices, including fuel cells and electrolyzers. Formation of an ionomer film from a solution, however, is not well understood, despite its importance for fabrication of electrodes in energy devices. Here, the evolution of the perfluorinated sulfonic acid morphology upon casting from a solution is observed using in situ grazing-incidence small- and wide-angle X-ray scattering. Aggregate interactions in dispersion directly impact the hydrophilic-domain network of the cast film and the onset of crystallization occurs simultaneously with the solution-to-film transition but continues to evolve on different time scales. In addition, confinement is shown to induce anisotropic morphology at multiple length scales.

In order to better investigate the impact of electrode irregularities on the long-term behavior of the cell, it is necessary to exclude the edge effects of the membrane electrode assemblies (MEAs) as a failure mode. Therefore, an effective electrode edge protection technique using thin protective gaskets and a hot-pressing procedure was developed which dramatically prolonged lifetime. Open circuit voltage (OCV), air polarization curve, and hydrogen crossover limiting current density were monitored during the DC tests. For post-DC ex-situ analysis, an in-house developed pinhole detection apparatus was employed to analyze quantity, size, and location of the failure points of MEAs with and without edge protection. Non-protected MEAs typically developed tears at the electrode perimeter, while the longer-lasting protected MEAs exhibited seemingly random pinhole development.","Electrochemical Society","","National Renewable Energy Lab.

Most of the research done to date was focused on membrane development, electrode fabrication, or cell performance. Studies of the polymer catalyst interface are needed in order to advance the science of these devices and achieve further improvements. In this work we have studied these interfacial properties using grazing-incidence small-angle x-ray scattering (GISAXS). Thin films of a perfluorinated anion exchange polymer were spin cast onto bare, or silver or platinum coated flat silicon substrates. From the GISAXS data, we can conclude that the polymer chains align parallel to the plain silicon or silver coated substrate at higher thicknesses, >17 nm and, >13 nm respectively. However, on the coated platinum substrate the alignment is somewhere between parallel and perpendicular. The in-plane alignment of ionomer on the surface constrains the swelling of water channels which affects the transport of reactants and products.","Electrochemical Society","","National Renewable Energy Lab.

An accurate 2-D membrane-electrode-assembly model is developed for differential cell modeling, which is combined with an along-the-channel stepping algorithm to account for down the channel changes in pressure, temperature, reactant concentration, and relative humidity. Variations in cell performance along the channel due to changes in operating conditions are characterized quantitatively and optimized, where drier feed conditions demonstratively require such an approach.

The EPA-GPR method can be used as an efficient method to estimate thermoelectric properties of materials for fast-screening applications, comparable to the original electron-phonon averaged (EPA) method and the electron-phonon averaged via moving-least-squares (EPA-MLS) method. The EPA-GPR method does not require specification of any open parameter, unlike the other EPA-related methods, since all the hyperparameters in the model can be unambiguously estimated within the type II maximum likelihood (ML-II) approximation. Thus, the EPA-GPR method is a parameter-free estimation method. Additionally, the concept of Gaussian processes in the EPA-GPR method allows us to quantify the uncertainty in estimated properties of thermoelectric materials. One can randomly realize the electron-phonon coupling coefficients from the identified Gaussian process, and those realized samples can be further analyzed in the solution process of the semiclassical Boltzmann transport equation for charge carriers. The results of the semiclassical Boltzmann transport equation provide the statistical properties of the thermoelectric properties of interest. The means, standard deviations, histograms, and confidence intervals of the Seebeck coefficient, the electrical conductivity, and the power factor can be constructed and analyzed. Furthermore the proposed EPA-GPR method is applied to a p-type half-Heusler compound, i.e., HfCoSb, as a case example, the results of which clearly present the advantages of the method.","American Physical Society (APS)","","Robert Bosch LLC, Cambridge, MA (United States)","USDOE Office of Energy Efficiency and Renewable Energy (EERE), Vehicle Technologies Office (EE-3V); USDOE","Robert Bosch LLC","United States","2019-03-25T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: Physical Review Materials; Journal Volume: 3; Journal Issue: 3","","Medium: ED; Size: Article No. 033803","","","EE0004840","Journal ID: ISSN 2475-9953; PRMHAR","10.1103/PhysRevMaterials.3.033803","","2021-07-29T00:00:00Z","1503307","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/1503307","https://www.osti.gov/servlets/purl/1503307","Physical Review Materials","3","3"

However, the loss of the B-site cations shifts the stoichiometry of the perovskite oxide. Depending on the amount exsolved and the initial stoichiometry, the exsolution can presumably shift the oxide away from its single-phase perovskite region. Herein, the direct comparison of initially stoichiometric composition Sr(Ti<sub>0.3</sub>Fe<sub>0.63</sub>Ni<sub>0.07</sub>)O<sub>3-δ</sub> (STFN0) with initially A-site deficient Sr<sub>0.95</sub>(Ti<sub>0.3</sub>Fe<sub>0.63</sub>Ni<sub>0.07</sub>)O<sub>3-δ</sub> (STFN5) is conducted and reported.

Whereas the oxide phase in reduced STFN5 shows a well-ordered perovskite structure, the greater B-site deficiency in reduced STFN0 results in a highly disordered and strained structure. The electrochemical performance of STFN0 anodes is inferior to that of STFN5 anodes, and even worse than SrTi<sub>0.3</sub>Fe<sub>0.7</sub>O<sub>3-δ</sub> (Ni-free) anodes. It appears that an initial Sr deficiency is important to avoid a too-high B-site deficiency after exsolution, which distorts the perovskite structure and impairs electrochemical processes.","Elsevier","","Northwestern Univ., Evanston, IL (United States)","USDOE Office of Science (SC), Basic Energy Sciences (BES) (SC-22).

Here, we present a kW-scale, 24-hour continuously operational, radiative sky cooling system, with both experimental study and detailed modeling. We first quantitatively show how water flow rate directly affects the system cooling power and inversely affects the water temperature drop. A day-and-night stagnant (flow rate = 0 L/(min·m<sup>2</sup>)) water cooling test of the system shows a consistent sub-ambient water temperature drop of 5–7 °C. A daytime cooling test of the system at a low flow rate of 0.227 L/(min·m<sup>2</sup>) yields a maximum sub-ambient temperature drop of 4.0 °C with an average net cooling power of around 80 W/m<sup>2</sup>. Further modelling for a typical metrological year (in Phoenix, Arizona) shows that the system could generate as much as 350 kWh cold (or 26 kWh/m<sup>2</sup>) with a sub-ambient temperature drop of 4–5 °C at a low flow rate of 0.1 L/(min·m<sup>2</sup>) during a typical summer month.

"Dynamic mechanical behavior of lithium-ion pouch cells subjected to high-velocity impact","Chen, Yanyu; Santhanagopalan, Shriram; Babu, Venkatesh; Ding, Yi","25 ENERGY STORAGE; 30 DIRECT ENERGY CONVERSION; lithium-ion battery; high-velocity impact; mechanical abuse; thermal runaway; short circuit","With broad-scale deployment of lithium-ion batteries, mechanical-abuse induced failure events such as short circuits and thermal runaway have made safety a focus of attention in battery design. Most previous studies have focused on quasi-static and low-velocity impact analyses, which could not represent the mechanical behavior of lithium-ion batteries in realistic situations. Here we report a combined experimental and computational study on the dynamic response of lithium-ion pouch cells subjected to high-velocity (200 m/s~1000 m/s) impact. Dynamic finite element simulations were performed to study the effects of internal interfacial behavior and external loading and boundary conditions on the dynamic mechanical behavior of pouch cells. Specifically, mechanical resistance across interfaces between different cell components have a pronounced impact on energy distribution and absorption, thereby determining the evolution of subsequent failure events. These results have practical implications for designing cells with liquid versus gel-type electrolytes, for example. Furthermore, finite element simulations on different external loading and boundary conditions indicate that a direct interaction between the impactor and the cell boundaries lead to a significant change in residual velocity, while the response of the pouch cell is independent of the prescribed far-field boundary conditions. In other words, there is not a significant difference in the response of pouch-format cells that have stacked electrodes versus wound electrodes at such high strain rates. These results are significantly different from quasi-static simulations wherein the evolution of failure events follows a very different pathway. In addition, the impact velocity profiles under different initial impact velocities offer the ballistic limit for the pouch cell and inform subsequent propagation analyses at the battery module level. Collectively, the findings presented here not only offer new perspectives on the role of the interfacial resistances and external boundary conditions on the mechanical safety of lithium-ion pouch cells, but also have implications for further investigations on cell design, modeling approaches, and test method development to study safety of lithium-ion batteries under extreme loading conditions.","Elsevier","","National Renewable Energy Lab.

"Two-stage ignition behavior and octane sensitivity of toluene reference fuels as gasoline surrogate","Kim, Doohyun; Westbrook, Charles K.; Violi, Angela","37 INORGANIC, ORGANIC, PHYSICAL, AND ANALYTICAL CHEMISTRY; 30 DIRECT ENERGY CONVERSION; octane sensitivity; two-stage ignition; knocking; toluene reference fuel","Current approaches to improve the efficiency of Spark-Ignition (SI) gasoline engines have been focusing on turbocharging, increasing the compression ratio, and pursuing advanced low-temperature combustion concepts. In order to maximize these strategies, it is important to optimize the knock resistance of the fuel, and therefore knowledge of the sensitivity of the ignition process under a wide range of engine operating conditions is required. Octane sensitivity (OS), which is defined as the difference between Research Octane Number (RON) and Motored Octane Number (MON), has been introduced to represent how fuel's ignition reactivity changes relative to the primary reference fuels (n-heptane/iso-octane) within RON/MON conditions. Previous works have indicated that OS is intimately related to low temperature reactivity of the fuel, which can be revealed as two-stage heat release characteristics during an ignition event. Prompted by these findings, in this paper, we investigate the relationship between two-stage ignition behavior and OS, using chemical kinetic simulations of 24 Toluene Reference Fuels (TRFs)/ethanol blends. TRFs are ternary mixtures of n-heptane/iso-octane/toluene, which is capable of capturing aromatic content and positive values of OS of real gasoline fuels. Simulation results show that fuels with weak or no two-stage ignition behavior tend to have high OS, due to their lack of Negative Temperature Coefficient (NTC) effect and high sensitivity in ignition delay time. Leveraging such observations, we develop a correlation between two-stage behavior and OS as an OS prediction method. Two metrics that represent the strength of the two-stage ignition behavior are proposed and used as OS predictors, which are Low Temperature Heat Release percentage (LTHR%) and Heat Release Rate at the end of first stage (HRR<sub>inf</sub>) calculated from a simple kinetic simulation. Regression analysis shows a clear trend between decreases in the proposed two-stage behavior metrics and increases in the value of OS of the fuel. We also test the new metric (LTHR%) using simulation results of 0-D reactors with imposed pressure time histories obtained from engine experiments, as well as using different TRF kinetic mechanisms. Here, the results demonstrate the effectiveness of the metric as a representation of the two-stage ignition behavior in practical combustion systems, highlighting the importance of the proposed relationship, and its potential as a simple and effective OS predictor.","Elsevier","External Audience (Unlimited)","Lawrence Livermore National Lab.

It was observed that there are structural changes with varied Co loadings, such as (1) sub-monolayer: <2.3 Co/nm<sup>2</sup>, (2) monolayer: 2.3–2.7 Co/nm<sup>2</sup>, and (3) over-monolayer: >2.7 Co/nm<sup>2</sup>. The highest molar rate was observed at the 2.7 Co/nm2 sample. In the case of over-monolayer samples, such as 7.1 Co/nm<sup>2</sup>, the oxidation state of Co affected the catalytic activity. Using in situ XAS, an oxidation state change from Co<sup>3+</sup> to Co<sup>2+</sup> between 200 and 300 °C was identified. Catalyst deactivation was also affected by the change of Co oxidation states from the fresh sample (Co<sup>3+</sup>) to the used sample (Co<sup>3+</sup>/Co<sup>2+</sup>). N<sub>2</sub>O formation and decomposition were affected by the reaction temperature in a two-step procedure, where NO converts into N<sub>2</sub>: (1) NO → N<sub>2</sub>O and (2) N<sub>2</sub>O → N<sub>2</sub>. N<sub>2</sub> selectivity monotonically increased with an increasing reaction temperature between 200 and 400 °C. Furthermore, the results provided several structure–property relationships and a possible reaction mechanism for NO reduction by CO reaction over CoO<sub><em>x</em></sub>/CeO<sub>2</sub> catalysts.","American Chemical Society","","Brookhaven National Lab.

Advanced distribution grids are considered to be functionally more sophisticated than traditional ones. The desirable advanced functionalities include – reconfiguration, real-time sensing, DERs, self-healing, etc. Some of these functionalities are currently being realized by microgrids as well. However, it is not feasible to convert each section of a distribution grid into a microgrid, but can be instituted with functionalities by design and controls at relatively lower costs. Interconnection of DERs, including energy storage to improve reliability and resilience is presented in details. Resilience of distribution grids is gaining greater importance and research towards enhancing it utilizing DERs is a key area. A real-time resilience framework with Analytical Hierarchical Processes (AHP) is developed that adapts to changing configurations, DERs, switching operations, grid conditions, etc. to provide an accurate and adoptable composite resilience metric. This framework and the composite resilience metric can play a unique role in operational and design decisions for operating future distribution grids. Advanced functionalities such as scenario-based reconfiguration in distribution grids are considered, with resilience metrics as performance criteria for choosing a preferred combination. Simulations are performed using Digital Real-Time Simulator (DRTS) and characterized response of flow battery validated against actual flow battery hardware is imposed to provide realistic results. Reconfiguration program is interfaced with DRTS for bi-directional real-time communication. Key contributions include enhancement of resilience of distribution grids using energy storage system under dynamic operating conditions.","Elsevier","","Idaho National Lab.

Cathode catalyst inks were prepared and characterized to elucidate the influences of ultrasonic dispersing method and time on catalyst ink particle size and CCL electrochemical properties. In situ ultra-small-, small-, and wide-angle X-ray scattering analyses were used to study the impact of ultrasonication time and methodology on changes in the agglomerate, aggregate, and particle size and distribution during the dispersing process. Ex-situ transmission electron microscopy was also used to investigate the particle size of these inks. Fuel cell membrane electrode assemblies (MEAs) were prepared and tested to determine the influence of ink properties on CCL electrochemical properties, including the electrochemical active surface area, mass activity, H2/air polarization curves, and oxygen mass-transport resistances. It was found that a combination of brief tip sonication followed by bath sonication was most effective at breaking up agglomerates, leading to maximum catalyst activity and MEA performance. Extended tip sonication was found to be too aggressive and resulted in detachment of the platinum nanoparticles from the carbon black support, which decreased electrochemical surface area and MEA performance. Quantification of oxygen mass transport resistance showed that electrodes with large catalyst agglomerates due to insufficient sonication had a higher non-Fickian (pressure independent) than properly dispersed catalyst. Through correlation of the performance with catalyst particle size, the desired CCL structure was proposed, which will provide insight into dispersion strategies for lab-scale spray coating and other processing techniques, as well as for large-scale manufacturing.","American Chemical Society (ACS)","","National Renewable Energy Lab.

In this study, catalytic fast pyrolysis (CFP) of rubber wastes over acidic zeolites was conducted, and the effect of SiO<sub>2</sub>/Al<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub> mole ratio of USY zeolites on the formation of aromatic hydrocarbons was explored. Experimental results indicated that alkenes and aromatic hydrocarbons were the main pyrolytic products obtained from fast pyrolysis of rubber wastes, and the pyrolysis temperature played a vital role in the formation of aromatics with the highest concentration achieved at 750 °C. Furthermore, catalyst types also affected the catalytic degradation of rubber wastes since limonene was completely decomposed in the presence of zeolites. Compared to SAPO-34, zeolites with higher external surface area, stronger Brønsted acid sites, and larger pore size, including USY, HY, and Hβ, were more effective in the production of aromatic hydrocarbons with the highest content obtained from USY catalyzed run. Given the observed effect of SiO<sub>2</sub>/Al<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub> mole ratio of USY zeolites on the formation of aromatic hydrocarbons during the CFP of rubber wastes, USY with low SiO<sub>2</sub>/Al<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub> ratio of 5.3 was more beneficial to the generation of aromatic hydrocarbons, while that with higher SiO<sub>2</sub>/Al<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub> mole ratio (11.5) facilitated the formation of alkenes. Simultaneously, the product distribution of aromatic hydrocarbons obtained from CFP of rubber wastes over USY zeolites was dominated by xylenes, alkylbenzenes, and toluene, and USY with SiO<sub>2</sub>/Al<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub> mole ratio of 5.3 was more active in the production of toluene and xylenes.","Elsevier","","Oak Ridge National Lab.

J.","30 DIRECT ENERGY CONVERSION; Thermoelectric; Thermal Conductivity; Electronic thermal conductivity; Lorenz number; Boltzmann transport theory; First principles calculations","Separation of thermal conductivity (k) into its electronic, lattice and other parts is of great importance in understanding heat transport. Commonly, the Wiedemanne–Franz relation is used to obtain the electronic thermal conductivity based on the electrical conductivity and a Lorenz number that is either set to the standard value for metals or using an approximate formula based on the Seebeck coefficient. We used the Boltzmann transport theory to test this formula for realistic electronic structures of thermoelectrics in different scattering regimes. Here, we find that this expression can give values of the Lorenz number that differ infstantially from Boltzmann theory for the range of doping levels important in thermoelectrics. This happens for materials with complex non-parabolic band structures, which are common in high performance thermoelectrics. The results imply that caution should be exercised in the use of this formula in thermoelectrics and other materials that may have complex electronic structures.","Elsevier","","Univ. of Missouri, Columbia, MO (United States)","USDOE Office of Science (SC), Basic Energy Sciences (BES) (SC-22).

"Electrokinetic energy conversion in nanochannels grafted with pH-responsive polyelectrolyte brushes modelled using augmented strong stretching theory","Sachar, Harnoor Singh; Sivasankar, Vishal Sankar; Das, Siddhartha","30 DIRECT ENERGY CONVERSION","Here, we develop a theory to quantify the electrokinetic energy conversion in electrolyte-filled nanochannels grafted with pH-responsive polyelectrolyte (PE) brushes. A pressure-driven flow drives the mobile electrolyte ions of the electric double layer (EDL) supported by the charged PE brushes leading to the generation of a streaming current, a streaming electric field and eventually an electrical energy. The salient feature of this study is that the brushes are described using our recently developed augmented Strong Stretching Theory (SST) model. In all the previous theoretical studies on liquid transport in PE-brush-grafted nanochannels, the brushes have either been assumed to be of constant height (independent of salt concentration or pH) or modelled using the Alexander–de-Gennes model that considers uniform monomer distribution along the brush height. Such simplifications have meant that the salt and the pH dependence of the brush height, the monomer distribution, and the resulting electrostatics have not been appropriately accounted for in the transport calculations. This paper addresses these limitations and provides a much more detailed description of the brushes while capturing the corresponding electrokinetic energy conversion. The findings establish that the presence of the PE brushes ensures a localization of the average EDL charge density away from the grafting surface, thereby enabling the migration of the EDL ions with a larger background flow velocity; as a consequence, there is an enhancement of the streaming current, streaming electric field, and the resulting electrical energy generation under certain grafting densities of the PE brushes.","Royal Society of Chemistry","","Univ. of Maryland, College Park, MD (United States)","USDOE Office of Science (SC), Basic Energy Sciences (BES)","","United States","2019-01-28T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: Soft Matter; Journal Volume: 15; Journal Issue: 29","","Medium: ED; Size: p. 5973-5986","","","SC0017741","Journal ID: ISSN 1744-683X; SMOABF","10.1039/c9sm00765b","","2022-04-01T00:00:00Z","1595329","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/1595329","https://www.osti.gov/servlets/purl/1595329","Soft Matter","29","15"

Although the impacts of either lattice strain or oxygen defects on the OER performance of oxide catalysts have been extensively investigated, the effects of both factors are normally treated separately. In this work, the coupled effects of both strain and oxygen deficiency on the electrocatalytic activity of La<sub>0.7</sub>Sr<sub>0.3</sub>CoO<sub>3-δ</sub> (LSC) thin films grown on single crystal substrates (LaAlO3 (LAO) and SrTiO3 (STO)) are investigated. Electrochemical tests show that the OER activities of LSC films are higher under compression than under tension, and are diminished as oxygen vacancies are introduced by vacuum annealing. Both experimental and computational results indicate that the LSC films under tension (e.g., LSC/STO) have larger oxygen deficiency than the films under compression (e.g., LSC/LAO), which attribute to smaller oxygen vacancy formation energy. Such strain-induced excessive oxygen vacancies in the LSC/STO increases the e<sub>g</sub> state occupancy and enlarges the energy gap between the O 2p and Co 3d band, resulting in lower OER activity. Understanding the critical role of strain–defect coupling is important for achieving the rational design of highly active and durable catalysts for energy devices.","Wiley","","Lawrence Berkeley National Lab.

However, CSP research focus is shifting toward the use of supercritical CO<sub>2</sub> Brayton cycles due to the significant improvement in thermal efficiencies. Here, we present a techno-economic study that compares the generated power and freshwater produced from a CSP system operated with a Rankine and Brayton cycle. Such a study facilitates co-analysis of the costs of producing both electricity and water among the other trade-off assessments. To minimize the levelized cost of water (LCOW), a desalination facility utilizing multi-effect distillation with thermal vapor compression (MED/TVC) instead of multistage flash distillation (MSF) is most suitable. The techno-economic analysis reveals that in areas where water production is crucial to be optimized, although levelized cost of electricity (LCOE) values are lowest for wet-cooled recompression closed Brayton cycle (RCBR) with MSF (12.1 cents/kWh<sub>e</sub>) and MED/TVC (12.4 cents/kWh<sub>e</sub>), there is only a 0.35 cents/kWh<sub>e</sub> increase for dry-cooled RCBR with MED/TVC to a cost of 12.8 cents/kWh<sub>e</sub>. In conclusion, this suggests that the best candidate for optimizing water production while minimizing both LCOW and LCOE is dry-cooled RCBR with MED/TVC desalination.","ASME","","Georgia Institute of Technology, Atlanta, GA (United States)","USDOE Office of Energy Efficiency and Renewable Energy (EERE), Renewable Power Office.

"Statistical change detection of building energy consumption: Applications to savings estimation","Touzani, Samir; Ravache, Baptiste; Crowe, Eliot; Granderson, Jessica","29 ENERGY PLANNING, POLICY, AND ECONOMY; 30 DIRECT ENERGY CONVERSION","The surge in interval meter data availability and associated activity in energy data analytics has inspired new interest in advanced methods for building efficiency savings estimation. Statistical and machine learning approaches are being explored to improve the energy baseline models used to measure and verify savings. One outstanding challenge is the ability to identify and account for operational changes that may confound savings estimates. In the measurement and verification (M&amp;V) context, ‘non-routine events’ (NREs) cause changes in building energy use that are not attributable to installed efficiency measures, and not accounted for in the baseline model’s independent variables. In the M&amp;V process NREs must be accounted for as ‘adjustments’ to appropriately attribute the estimated energy savings to the specific efficiency interventions that were implemented. Currently this is a manual and custom process, conducted using professional judgment and engineering expertise. As such it remains a barrier in scaling and standardizing meter-based savings estimation. Here in this work, a data driven methodology was developed to (partially) automate, and therefore streamline the process of detecting NREs in the post-retrofit period and making associated savings adjustments. The proposed NRE detection algorithm is based on a statistical change point detection method and a dissimilarity metric. The dissimilarity metric measures the proximity between the actual time series of the post-retrofit energy consumption and the projected baseline, which is generated using a statistical baseline model. The suggested approach for NRE adjustment involves the NRE detection algorithm, the M&amp;V practitioner, and a regression modeling algorithm. The performance of the detection and adjustment algorithm was evaluated using a simulation-generated test data set, and two benchmark algorithms. Results show a high true positive detection rate (75%-100% across the test cases), higher than ideal false positive detection rates (20%-70%), and low errors in energy adjustment (&lt;0.7%). These results indicate that the algorithm holds for helping M&amp;V practitioners to streamline the process of handling NREs. Moreover, the change point algorithm and underlying statistical principles could prove valuable for other building analytics applications such as anomaly detection and fault diagnostics.","Elsevier","","Lawrence Berkeley National Lab.

"An Enhanced Model Predictive Control Using Virtual Space Vectors for Grid-Connected Three-Level Neutral-Point Clamped Inverters","Alhosaini, Waleed; Wu, Yuheng; Zhao, Yue","30 DIRECT ENERGY CONVERSION","Reliability of power systems can be improved by the use of voltage source inverters (VSIs) with fast dynamic control, which can handle uncertainties induced by renewable energy resources and nonlinear loads. To ensure fast-dynamic response and simplified controller design, various model predictive control (MPC) methods are investigated in this paper. In the conventional MPC design for three-level VSIs, the cost function requires an additional term to ensure the balance of the neutral-point voltage (NP-V), which however can considerably impact the main goal of the MPC. To address this issue, an enhanced MPC using virtual space vectors is proposed, which allows the use of a significantly reduced weighting factor for the term in the cost function for NP-V balancing, while retaining fast-dynamic response. Additionally, the proposed MPC leads to reduced harmonic distortion in the VSI output voltage and current. Both simulation and controller hardware-in-the-loop studies are performed to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed enhanced MPC in an operating microgrid under both steady-state and fast-transient conditions.","IEEE","","Univ. of Arkansas, Fayetteville, AR (United States)","USDOE Office of Energy Efficiency and Renewable Energy (EERE), Renewable Power Office.

"The Case for Recycling: Overview and Challenges in the Material Supply Chain for Automotive Li-Ion Batteries","Mayyas, Ahmad; Steward, Darlene; Mann, Margaret","25 ENERGY STORAGE; 30 DIRECT ENERGY CONVERSION; cathode; electric vehicles; end-of-life; Li-ion batteries; recycling","Lithium ion batteries (LIB) continue to gain market share in response to the increasing demand for electric vehicles, consumer electronics, and energy storage. The increased demand for LIB has highlighted potential problems in the supply chain of raw materials needed for their manufacture. Some critical metals used in LIB, namely lithium, cobalt, and graphite are scarce, are not currently mined in large quantities, or are mined in only a few countries whose trade policies could limit availability and impact prices. The environmental and social impacts of mining these materials have also drawn attention as production ramps up to meet the increased demand. Closed-loop systems with recycling at the end-of-life provide a pathway to lower environmental impacts and a source of high value materials that can be used in producing new batteries. Because environmental regulations concerning end-of-life batteries are not fully developed or implemented, most of these batteries currently end up in the landfills, with a very small number of spent batteries sent to the existing recycling facilities. However, with proactive regulations, an increasing supply of spent batteries, and innovations in recycling technologies, end-of-life batteries could supply a significant fraction of the materials needed for manufacturing of new LIB. This paper reviews the current state of the LIB manufacturing supply chain, addresses some issues associated with battery end-of-life, and sheds light on the importance of LIB recycling from the environmental and value chain perspectives. We also discuss the expected benefits of recycling on the global LIB supply chain.","Elsevier","","National Renewable Energy Lab.

These ion-conductive solids also provide increased safety by replacing flammable liquid electrolytes. Although solid-state electrolytes are significantly more stable and dendrite-resistant than traditional liquid electrolytes, lithium anodes in all-solid systems may nevertheless grow dendrites under high stress or repeated cycling, leading to short circuits and premature battery breakdown. For this reason, we study the formation and propagation of Li metal features within solid electrolytes using synchrotron-based X-ray tomography with in-situ current-voltage cycling supported by our custom sample platform. Our results demonstrate the ability of this technique to delineate different layers of the Li/LPS/Li structure with spatial resolution approaching 1 um. At this resolution, we are able to detect expansion of voids, especially in early stages of cycling. This expansion of voids is observed throughout the volume of the symmetric cells and visually resembles propagation of cracks resulting from interactions between the Li metal and pre-existing voids in the LPS electrolyte.","The Electrochemical Society","","National Renewable Energy Lab.

Persistent challenges for fuel cells and electrolyzers include high initial cost and the availability of hydrogen infrastructure to support FCEV and MHE fleets. Cost of fuel cells are still high compared to other power generation systems such as diesel and natural gas generators. This, however, can be linked to two facts: first is low production volumes generally and second is emerging manufacturing technologies currently in R&D that need to be scaled up to factory production volumes. This study investigates current manufacturing processes used in production of fuel cells (e.g., spray coating and manual assembly) and emerging manufacturing technologies (e.g., roll-to-roll catalyst coating) to investigate key cost drivers and potential cost reductions in manufacturing of fuel cells and electrolyzers.

This approach has particular advantages for the desert environment, where conventional energy harvesting devices are severely confounded by frequent sandstorms, extreme temperature and high solar fluence. Herein, we design, fabricate, and test a thermal resonator for the conversion of diurnal temperature fluctuations to electrical power in a harsh desert environment using a thermally conductive phase change composite as a high thermal effusivity material, specifically tuned to the temperature fluctuating environment of Thuwal, Saudi Arabia (22.3095°N, 39.1047°E). The composite consists of a highly porous and thermally conductive nickel foam impregnated with eicosane as a phase change material for enhanced thermal capacity. The high thermal effusivity material is incorporated into a rationally-designed thermal resonance device, which is tested for a period of two weeks in Saudi Arabia, extracting as high as 2 mW from approximately 10 °C diurnal temperature fluctuations.

Here we report on a recent breakthrough in chemical durability that has been achieved through using covalently attached heteropoly acid (HPA) moieties as both the proton conducting acid and the radical decomposition catalyst. Exceptional chemical durability is reported for a thin (25 um) film in an accelerated stress test that eventually had an open circuit voltage decay rate of 520 uV h<sup>-1</sup>, which was shown to be a result of the formation of an electrical short after thinning due to mechanical stresses. A mechanism is proposed using density functional theory in which the W atoms in the HPA reversibly change oxidation state from W(VI) to W(V) while decomposing radical species. Using rate constants found in the literature and realistic concentrations of scavenging species, it is hypothesized that the rate of radical decomposition can be >35x faster for HPA containing membranes than it is for Ce doped films. Furthermore, it is concluded that covalently tethered HPA should be considered as a next generation chemical stabilization strategy for polymer electrolyte fuel cells.","The Electrochemical Society","","National Renewable Energy Lab.

Abundant supply, flexibility of installation, and decreasing cost makes it an interesting renewable energy resource. However, there are challenges associated with the reliability of solar power due to its intermittent nature. This work demonstrates the synergies that exist in integrated hybrid systems, where a dispatchable fuel is used in conjunction with concentrated solar power. In this simulation-based study, a parabolic trough solar concentrator is used to collect solar energy. The heat collected from the solar field is used to generate steam in a Rankine cycle. The system also utilizes natural gas combustion in the steam generator to provide supplemental steam when the solar intensity is reduced due to cloud cover or at night. Natural gas is also used for superheating the steam, which allows the system to produce higher temperatures and achieve increased thermodynamic cycle efficiencies. This flexible design produces 100 MW at nominal conditions, while it is capable of producing a maximum of 140 MW when sufficient solar energy is available. The novel contributions of this work include a complete, systems-level, dynamic model of a hybrid solar plant. The model is complete with a control system that smoothly transitions the plant from pure natural gas mode at night to solar hybrid mode during the day. It evaluates innovative design features such as flexible fuel operation, steam superheating to boost efficiency, and preheating by solar or waste heat. Furthermore, this work demonstrates that by hybridizing a solar system with a dispatchable energy source, both the reliability and efficiency of the solar power production are increased. The annual solar-to-electric efficiency increases from 15.2% to 26.13% with hybridization, which indicates that utilization of the solar energy is effectively increased.","Elsevier","","Univ. of Utah, Salt Lake City, UT (United States)","USDOE Office of Energy Efficiency and Renewable Energy (EERE), Energy Efficiency Office.

We here report that the minor amount of bismuth in commercial silver pastes can transport to the interface of electrode/Gd-doped CeO<sub>2</sub> (GDC) electrolyte and seriously corrode grain-boundaries (GBs) of the GDC electrolyte, a commonly used intermediate-temperature electrolyte, causing significant ionic conductivity degradation. A comprehensive electron microscopic analysis reveals that the Bi-corrosion takes place along GBs of GDC electrolyte acting as “washing flux” agent, causing grain separation and thus blocking ionic conduction. It is also found that electrical field enhances the “Bi-washing” effect, leading to a faster degradation in full-cell than in half-cell. Altogether, the use of commercial silver paste as a current collector for CeO<sub>2</sub>-based electrolytes in long-term testing should be cautioned.","The Electrochemical Society","","Univ. of South Carolina, Columbia, SC (United States)","USDOE Office of Fossil Energy (FE), Clean Coal and Carbon Management","","United States","2018-10-15T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: Journal of the Electrochemical Society Journal Volume: 165 Journal Issue: 13","","Medium: X; Size: p.

A new modeling strategy is developed to consider the displacements of solid bodies and moving boundaries in finite element models. The transient thermal-electric modeling of the AEC demonstrates the effect of an increase in operating voltage on both the anode cover and the side ledge. With higher heat generation, the anode cover deteriorates and the side ledge thickness decreases. Since the anode cover is characterized by irreversible transformations, the top heat dissipation remains higher even when the operating voltage comes back to its typical value. For the first time, the transient temperature and electric fields throughout the anode life are simulated and validated by industrial measurements. The modeling predictions have been validated from instrumented anodes and manual measurements, all performed on operating AEC.","","","","","","United States","2019-04-15T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: Metallurgical and Materials Transactions.

It is imperative that contamination mechanisms are understood to mitigate these losses. In some cases, chemical breakdown of the polymer membrane can lead to formation of small molecules that can infiltrate and adsorb onto the catalyst layer, resulting in lower fuel cell performance and durability. Surface coverages of perfluorinated acid model compounds, representing polymer electrolyte membrane (PEM) chemical degradation products, were studied using an electrochemical quartz crystal microbalance (EQCM) with a polycrystalline platinum electrode. Perfluorosulfonic acid model compounds with a terminal sulfonic acid group exhibited no adsorption and no mass change. A similar model compound with a terminal carboxylic acid functional group exhibited higher surface coverage and stronger adsorption strength. Perfluorinated diacids, representing degradation products of a Nafion and 3M membrane, both showed mass increases well into the Pt oxide region, suggesting that the compounds were not fully displaced by surface oxides and that the terminal sulfonic acid group played a secondary role in the adsorption. Both perfluorinated chain length and functional group were found to play important roles in Pt surface adsorption characteristics.","The Electrochemical Society","","National Renewable Energy Lab.

Single-atom catalyst (SAC), as a new research frontier in heterogeneous catalysis, has demonstrated emerging prospects for many electrocatalytic reactions. Support assisted pyrolysis approaches are widely used in the synthesis of single-atom electrocatalysts. While extensive efforts have been devoted to increase the loading of the atomically dispersed metal sites, the role of the support in creating these active metal sites remains largely unexplored. Herein, we compare catalysts created by support-free and support-assisted pyrolysis of vitamin B12 and cobalt tetramethoxyphenylporphyrin, respectively, and demonstrate an important effect of support-induced structural reconstruction that directly controls the activation of SAC. Electrochemical studies show support-free catalysts are inactive for oxygen reduction reaction whereas the support-assisted pyrolysis yields highly active catalysts using the same molecular precursors. X-ray absorption spectroscopy experiments reveal that both the metal-nitrogen coordination and the type of nitrogen species are different in these two types of samples, which leads to a difference in the d-band of the cobalt metal center and ultimately controls the catalytic activity and stability. In conclusion, this new insight provides a unique perspective on how to tune the electrocatalytic performances of SAC at the molecular level.","American Chemical Society (ACS)","","Argonne National Lab.

R.","30 DIRECT ENERGY CONVERSION; solid oxide fuel cells; degradation mechanisms; digital volume correlation","Degradation mechanisms within solid oxide fuel cells (SOFC) during thermal cycling limit operational start-up times and cell lifetime, and must therefore be better understood and mitigated. This work explores such mechanisms using digital volume correlation (DVC) techniques applied to lab-based X-ray tomograms where the microstructural evolution is evaluated during the operational cycling of a Ni–YSZ/YSZ cell. To emulate reduced start-up times, five tomograms were collected over four operational thermal cycles to 750 °C at various ramp-rates: 3, 10, 20 and 30 °C min<sup>–1</sup>. Two key features are observed in the 3D strain profiles. Firstly, during low ramp-rates the material produces microscopic channels towards cluster-points. This is thought to be caused by the ceramic skeleton inhibiting the effects of sintering. Secondly, previously unseen macroscopic ‘waves’ developed after high-rate cycling, consisting of linear regions of compression and tension throughout the sample. These wave features decay away from a heterogeneous defect which is thought to be responsible for the non-uniform strain profile. This work demonstrates the first use of sub-micron DVC computations applied to an SOFC exposed to operationally relevant temperatures. Lastly, these findings will assist in the development of new electrode materials from their fabrication to operation, ultimately supporting commercial viability of SOFCs.","Royal Society of Chemistry","","National Renewable Energy Lab.

Therefore, morphology or arrangement of these different materials can be critical in the performance of an energy conversion device. In this paper, we study a model problem motivated by a solar-driven thermochemical conversion device that splits water into hydrogen and oxygen. We formulate the problem as a system of coupled multi-material reaction-diffusion equations where each species diffuses selectively through a given material and where the reaction occurs at multi-material interfaces.

While band edge and Fermi energies can be rigorous thermodynamic descriptors of bulk materials, we show here that their application to nanoscale systems is problematic. A change of one electron at a 1000 atom nanoparticle or a localized surface site on a catalyst/electrode causes significant nuclear reorganization of the system. Electron transfer is often coupled with solvent reorganization and/or with the transfer of ions, including ion intercalation, surface binding, and movement within the surrounding double layer. These effects can be significant (even for some bulk materials). However, Fermi and band energies, as typically used, do not include the energetics of nuclear reorganizations or cation coupling.

These techniques mitigate the potential impact of poor quality on the cost of MEA components by real-time identification of process-induced irregularities, which can result from the manufacturing process or subsequent handling of the material during assembly into a full MEA. A particular type of irregularity known to impact MEA lifetime is loss of membrane integrity, e.g. via a pinhole. In this work, we focus on development of a technique to detect pinholes in membrane-containing MEA sub-assemblies - as opposed to in just the membrane - using a reactive excitation strategy coupled with infrared thermography for detection. A specialized device is introduced and, using various MEA sub-assemblies, is shown to enable detection of pinholes in stationary samples. Multi-physics modeling is utilized to understand and predict the impact of various design and operational parameters of this technique. The feasibility of the technique is demonstrated through both modeling and in-situ results. For example, a detectable (≥1 degree C) thermal response for a membrane pinhole of approximately 90 um in diameter is measured in a fraction of a second. The observed detection time is considered to be appropriate for further exploration of the technique in an in-line configuration.","Elsevier","","National Renewable Energy Lab.

Synergies between these technologies exist, however, configurations to couple them have been insufficiently investigated. This study compares the theoretical energy efficiencies of converting waste directly into electricity, using AD and BES alone and in various combinations. This study reviews the experimentally demonstrated energy efficiencies reported in the literature with comparisons to the maximum theoretical efficiencies, considering thermodynamic limits. Acetate is used as an ideal substrate for theoretical calculations, whereas complex wastes are used for extended analyses of practical efficiencies. In addition, to evaluate the economic potential of this technology, a brief case study was conducted using the Oak Ridge National Laboratory (ORNL) water resource recovery facility (WRRF). Sensitivity analysis was performed on several parameters in the economic model. The results of this study indicate the combined Anaerobic Digester/Microbial Electrolysis Cell (ADMEC) process may be the best path forward due to the high energy efficiency, combined with potential economic benefits, but is not at commercial readiness. We estimate energy efficiencies of 52.9% and 45.6% for the ADMEC process, using current state-of-the-technology, for converting food waste and sewage sludge to a CH<sub>4</sub>/H<sub>2</sub> mix, respectively. Finally, this study concludes with a discussion of new strategies to improve the energy efficiency of AD and BES processes.","Elsevier","","Oak Ridge National Lab.

These include the use of effective thermal conductivities to account for complex corrugated geometries and apparent surface emissivities to accommodate the effect of radiation shields. Furthermore, a simplified analytical model is developed to account for conduction bypass through the Na-TEC liquid-return path. An iterative procedure between the finite-element and thermodynamic models is described in detail, and the thermal performance of the design proposed herein is analyzed. According to this analysis, a maximum efficiency of 29% and a maximum power output of 125 W can be achieved.","Elsevier","","Georgia Institute of Technology, Atlanta, GA (United States)","USDOE Office of Energy Efficiency and Renewable Energy (EERE), Renewable Power Office.

"Continuous electrochemical heat engines","Poletayev, Andrey D.; McKay, Ian S.; Chueh, William C.; Majumdar, Arun","30 DIRECT ENERGY CONVERSION","Given the large magnitude of energy in waste heat, its efficient conversion to electrical power offers a significant opportunity to lower greenhouse gas emissions. Furthermore, it has been difficult to optimize the performance of new direct energy conversion approaches because of the coupling between entropy change and thermal and electrical transport in continuously operating devices. With electrochemical cells driving flowing electrolytes in symmetric redox reactions at different temperatures, we demonstrate two continuous electrochemical heat engines that operate at 10–50 °C and at 500–900 °C, respectively. Simulations of kilowatt-scale systems using electrochemical cells stacked in series suggest efficiencies over 30% of the Carnot limit and areal power densities competitive with solid-state thermoelectrics at maximum power. Although entropy change, thermal transport and electrical transport are inherently coupled in solid-state thermoelectrics, they can be somewhat circumvented in electrochemical systems, thus offering new opportunities to engineer efficient energy conversion systems.","Royal Society of Chemistry","","SLAC National Accelerator Lab., Menlo Park, CA (United States)","USDOE","","United States","2018-07-16T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: Energy & Environmental Science; Journal Volume: 11; Journal Issue: 10","","Medium: ED; Size: p. 2964-2971","","","AC02-76SF00515; DGE-1147470","Journal ID: ISSN 1754-5692; EESNBY","10.1039/c8ee01137k","","2022-01-03T00:00:00Z","1490884","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/1490884","https://www.osti.gov/servlets/purl/1490884","Energy & Environmental Science","10","11"

However, the current deployment of such CHP systems in the U.S. residential sector is extremely low primarily due to their high cost, short system life, and low system efficiency. Based on an analysis of average energy consumption of representative single-family homes in 10 U.S. cities across 7 different climate zones, it is concluded that there is no one-size-fits-all residential CHP system, but that a range of products are more likely to reflect consumer preferences. It is further identified via a systematic techno-economic analysis (TEA) that high-efficiency (e.g., 30% - 40% fuel to electricity), long-life (e.g., 15 years), low-cost (preferably less than U.S. $2,500 installed price), and low emissions are key requirements to enable widespread deployment of CHP systems in the U.S. residential sector. This article analyzes how the payback period would change for each city by varying nearly a dozen parameters and concludes with an evaluation on maximum market penetration based on a given set of parameters, and the resulting energy and emissions savings that can be practically achieved in some scenarios.","Elsevier","","Booz Allen Hamilton, Inc., McLean, VA (United States)","USDOE Advanced Research Projects Agency - Energy (ARPA-E)","","United States","2018-06-22T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: Applied Energy; Journal Volume: 226; Journal Issue: C; Related Information: http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.apenergy.2018.06.013","","Medium: ED; Size: p. 1064-1075","","","AR0000154; 89703018CAR000001","Journal ID: ISSN 0306-2619; PII: S0306261918308821","10.1016/j.apenergy.2018.06.013","","2021-10-26T00:00:00Z","1458448","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/1458448","https://www.osti.gov/servlets/purl/1458448","Applied Energy","C","226"

Electrochemical reduction (ECR) is one of the upgrading technologies, alternative to catalytic reduction, which only requires electricity as the energy input, which can be derived from carbon free energy sources. Moreover, ECR does not require external addition of hydrogen, as this can be generated in-situ. In this work an anion exchange membrane (AEM) electrolyte assembly (MEA) has been tested for the efficient reduction of biomass derived molecules, and compared with a cation exchange membrane (CEM) MEA. The cathode electrocatalyst has been modified with the addition of hydrophobicity and anion exchange ionomers, and incorporated onto an anion exchange membrane. Electrochemical experiments were performed with a metal free electrocatalyst in the presence and absence of surrogate compounds. The results showed that changes in the catalyst formulation can increase the overpotential for the competing hydrogen evolution reaction (HER), while significantly enhancing the reduction of the organic molecules. Bulk electrolysis experiments demonstrated higher efficiencies for furfural ECR in an AEM-MEA vs. AEM-CEM, reaching conversions up to 94% at 50 mA cm<sup>2</sup> and in the absence of supporting electrolyte. Moreover, AEM-MEA was able to facilitate water management during the reduction process and contribute to the separation of small carboxylic acids.","American Chemical Society (ACS)","","Idaho National Lab.

It was found that D6584-17 as currently written may not accurately determine MGs from conventional feedstocks due to significant differences in retention time using modern instrumentation. For biodiesel from non-traditional feedstocks, D6584-17 did not sufficiently account for MGs containing fatty acids outside of C16 and C18 species. This led to under- and over-reporting of MGs, as critical components were not accurately measured. Improvements to the method were made through a three-step process. First, a standard mixture of MGs was run to determine the retention time of individual MGs that could be present in the samples from C10 to C24. An additional analysis for the fatty acid methyl ester (FAME) profile was used to determine the major MG species present in the biodiesel samples, using the assumption that the MG profile was proportional to the FAME profile. The biodiesel samples were analyzed by D6584-17, and the MGs were identified using retention time matching, based on the major species expected from measuring the FAME profile. Here, by combining these two methods, the accuracy of MG determination by D6584-17 was improved for biodiesels prepared from all feedstocks.","Elsevier","","National Renewable Energy Lab.

There was a noticeable effect of the jet/grid ratios on the syngas concentration. An increase in CO, CH<sub>4</sub>, and C<sub>2</sub> gases was obtained at the condition closer to jet/grid = 50:50, whereas a higher jet/grid ratio favored water–gas shift reaction by increasing CO<sub>2</sub> and H<sub>2</sub> gases under the pressurized condition.

Also, higher temperature and ER promoted a reduction in contaminant gases as well as tar yield. Tar product yield was also reduced significantly after a wet scrubber, and the tar consisted of chemicals of a carbon number less than 13 (≤C<sub>12</sub>). Here, the gasification biochar was also analyzed and showed an effective carbon sequestration property with a relatively higher surface area (105 m<sup>2</sup>/g).

The single decision structure is then used to predict activity-travel choices, with those downstream in the decision-making chain influenced by those upstream in the sequence. The adoption of a singular sequential causal structure to depict relationships among activity-travel choices in travel demand model systems ignores the possibility that some choices are made jointly as a bundle as well as the possible presence of structural heterogeneity in the population with respect to decision-making processes. As different segments in the population may adopt and follow different causal decision-making mechanisms when making selected choices jointly, it would be of value to develop simultaneous equations model systems relating multiple endogenous choice variables that are able to identify population subgroups following alternative causal decision structures. Because the segments are not known a priori, they are considered latent and determined endogenously within a joint modeling framework proposed in this paper. The methodology is applied to a national mobility survey data set to identify population segments that follow different causal structures relating residential location choice, vehicle ownership, and car-share and mobility service usage. It is found that the model revealing three distinct latent segments best describes the data, confirming the efficacy of the modeling approach and the existence of structural heterogeneity in decision-making in the population. Future versions of activity-travel model systems should strive to incorporate such structural heterogeneity to better reflect varying decision processes across population subgroups.","Springer","","National Renewable Energy Lab.

For the centralized steam methane reforming (SMR) pathway, hydrogen FCETs reduce life-cycle or well-to-wheel (WTW) petroleum energy use by more than 98% compared to their diesel counterparts. The reduction in WTW air emissions for gaseous hydrogen (G.H2) FCETs ranges from 20 to 45% for greenhouse gases, 37-65% for VOC, 49-77% for CO, 62-83% for NOx, 19-43% for PM10, and 27-44% for PM2.5, depending on vehicle weight classes and truck types. With the current U.S. average electricity generation mix, FCETs tend to create more WTW SOx emissions than their diesel counterparts, mainly because of the upstream emissions related to electricity use for hydrogen compression/liquefaction. Compared to G.H2, liquid hydrogen (L.H2) FCETs generally provide smaller WTW emissions reductions. For both G.H2 and L.H2 pathways for FCETs, because of electricity consumption for compression and liquefaction, spatio-temporal variations of electricity generation can affect the WTW results. In conclusion, FCETs retain the WTW emission reduction benefits, even when considering aggressive diesel engine efficiency improvement.","Elsevier","","National Renewable Energy Lab.

Electrons flow along the magnetosheath separatrices, converge in the diffusion region, and jet past the X-point into the magnetosphere. The resulting accumulation of negative charge generates intense parallel electric fields that eject electrons along the magnetospheric separatrices and produce field-aligned beams.

Since it is impractical to test every fuel cell for this length of time, there is ever increasing interest in developing accelerated stress tests (ASTs) that can accurately simulate the material component degradation in the membrane electrode assembly (MEA) observed under automotive operating conditions, but over a much shorter time frame. In this work, a square-wave catalyst AST was examined that shows a 5X time acceleration factor over the triangle-wave catalyst AST and a 25X time acceleration factor over the modified wet drive-cycle catalyst durability protocol, significantly decreasing the testing time. These acceleration factors were correlated to the platinum (Pt) particle size increase and associated decrease in electrochemical surface area (ECSA). This square-wave AST has been adopted by the DOE as a standard protocol to evaluate catalyst durability. We also compare three catalyst-durability protocols using state-of-the-art platinum-cobalt catalysts supported on high surface area carbon (SOA Pt-Co/HSAC) in the cathode catalyst layer. The results for each of the three tests showed both catalyst particle size increase and transition metal leaching. Moreover the acceleration factors for the alloy catalysts were smaller due to Co leaching being the predominant mechanism of voltage decay in ~5 nm PtCo/C catalysts. Finally, an extremely harsh carbon corrosion AST was run using the same SOA Pt-Co/HSAC catalyst. This showed minimal change in particle size and a low percentage Co loss from the cathode catalyst particles, despite a significant loss in catalyst layer thickness and cell performance. The carbon corrosion rates during these various ASTs were directly measured by monitoring the CO2 emission from the cathode, further confirming the ability of the square-wave AST to evaluate the electro-catalyst independently of the support.","The Electrochemical Society","","Los Alamos National Lab.

Measurements have been performed at two pressures (10 and 30 bar), and at three fuel/air equivalence ratios (0.5, 1.0 and 2.0) for TRF mixtures of 50%, 75% and 90% by volume toluene concentration, over the temperature range of 650–1450 K. It was found that, increasing the n-heptane content, led to an increase in reactivity and shorter measured IDTs. Reduced sensitivity to the equivalence ratio was observed at high temperatures, especially for high toluene content mixtures. A well validated detailed kinetic mechanism for TRF oxidation was utilized to provide further insight into the experimental evidence. The mechanism, which has recently been updated, was also assessed in terms of its validity, contributing thus to its continuous development. Reaction path analysis was performed to delineate critical aspects of toluene oxidation under the considered conditions. Moreoever, sensitivity analysis highlighted the interactions between the chemistry of the two TRF components, revealing toluene's character as a reactivity inhibitor mainly through the consumption of ÓH radicals.","Elsevier","External Audience (Unlimited)","Lawrence Livermore National Lab.

"Test methodologies for hydrogen sensor performance assessment: Chamber vs. flow-through test apparatus","Ortiz Cebolla, Rafael (ORCID:0000000334064304); Weidner, Eveline; Buttner, William (ORCID:0000000173342181); Bonato, Christian; Hartmann, Kevin; Schmidt, Kara","30 DIRECT ENERGY CONVERSION; hydrogen sensors; testing methodology; chamber; flow-through","Certification of hydrogen sensors to meet standards often prescribes using large-volume test chambers [1,2]. However, feedback from stakeholders such as sensor manufacturers and end-users indicates that chamber test methods are often viewed as too slow and expensive for routine assessment. Flow-through test methods are potentially an efficient and cost-effective alternative for sensor performance assessment. A large number of sensors can be simultaneously tested, in series or in parallel, with an appropriate flow-through test fixture. The recent development of sensors with response times of less than 1s mandates improvements in equipment and methodology to properly capture the performance of this new generation of fast sensors; flow methods are a viable approach for accurate response and recovery time determinations, but there are potential drawbacks. According to ISO 26142 [1], flow-through test methods may not properly simulate ambient applications. In chamber test methods, gas transport to the sensor is dominated by diffusion which is viewed by some users as mimicking deployment in rooms and other confined spaces. Conversely, in flow-through methods, forced flow transports the gas to the sensing element. The advective flow dynamics may induce changes in the sensor behaviour relative to the quasi-quiescent condition that may prevail in chamber test methods. The aim of the current activity in the JRC and NREL sensor laboratories [3,4] is to develop a validated flow-through apparatus and methods for hydrogen sensor performance testing. In addition to minimizing the impact on sensor behaviour induced by differences in flow dynamics, challenges associated with flow-through methods include the ability to control environmental parameters (humidity, pressure and temperature) during the test and changes in the test gas composition induced by chemical reactions with upstream sensors. Guidelines on flow-through test apparatus design and protocols for the evaluation of hydrogen sensor performance have been developed. Various commercial sensor platforms (e.g., thermal conductivity, catalytic and metal semiconductor) were used to demonstrate the advantages and issues with the flow-through methodology.","Elsevier","","National Renewable Energy Lab.

A centralized MIMO controller was preferred compared to a decentralized control approach because previous simulation studies showed that the coupling effect identified during the simultaneous control of the turbine speed and cathode airflow was better minimized. The MIMO controller was developed using a state-space dynamic model of the system that was derived using first-order transfer functions empirically obtained through experimental tests. The controller performance was evaluated in terms of disturbance rejection through perturbations in the gas turbine operation, and setpoint tracking maneuver through turbine speed and cathode airflow steps. The experimental results illustrate that a multicoordination control strategy was able to mitigate the coupling of each actuator to each output during the simultaneous control of the system, and improved the overall system performance during transient conditions. On the other hand, the controller showed different performance during validation in simulation environment compared to validation in the physical facility, which will require a better dynamic modeling of the system for the implementation of future multivariable control strategies.","ASME","","Ames Lab., Ames, IA (United States)","USDOE Office of Fossil Energy (FE)","","United States","2018-04-11T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: Journal of Electrochemical Energy Conversion and Storage; Journal Volume: 15; Journal Issue: 3","","Medium: ED; Size: Article No. 031007","","IS-J-9580","AC02-07CH11358","Journal ID: ISSN 2381-6872","10.1115/1.4039356","","2022-05-23T00:00:00Z","1433655","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/1433655","https://www.osti.gov/servlets/purl/1433655","Journal of Electrochemical Energy Conversion and Storage","3","15"

However, ethylene production is energy-intensive and represents the most energy-consuming single process in the chemical industry. In this communication, we report, for the first time, a novel low-thermal-budget process for the co-production of ethylene and pure hydrogen using a proton-conducting electrochemical deprotonation cell. At a constant current density of 1 A cm<sup>–2</sup>, corresponding to a hydrogen production rate of 0.448 mol cm<sup>–2</sup> per day, and 400 °C, a close to 100% ethylene selectivity was achieved under an electrochemical overpotential of 140 mV. Compared to an industrial ethane steam cracker, the electrochemical deprotonation process can achieve a 65% saving in process energy and reduce the carbon footprint by as much as 72% or even more if renewable electricity and heat are used. If the heating value of produced hydrogen is taken into account, the electrochemical deprotonation process actually has a net gain in processing energy. The electrochemical deprotonation process at reduced temperatures in the present study provides a disruptive approach for petrochemical manufacturing, shifting the paradigm from thermal chemical practice to a clean energy regime.","Royal Society of Chemistry","","Idaho National Lab.

Currently the addition of a mechanical support in the membrane is able to adequately solve issues of mechanical degradation, but chemical degradation via oxygenated radical attack remains an unsolved challenge. Typical mitigation strategies use cerium or manganese species to serve as radical scavengers, but these ions are able to migrate in the membrane and even leach out of the system. The approach used in this paper is to covalently link and immobilize a heteropoly acid (HPA), more specifically 11-silicotungstic acid (HSiW11), a lacunary HPA of the Keggin structure to a fluoroelastomer, serving as both a radical decomposition catalyst and the proton conducting acid. This dual functionality allows for both high content of radical scavenging species and high ion-exchange capacity. An efficient three step, high yield (77%), commercially viable synthesis for this polymer is reported. The synthesis route for making this new heteropoly acid functionalized polymer is confirmed using infrared spectroscopy (IR), nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy, and thermogravimetric analysis (TGA). The material exhibits clustering of the HSiW11 moieties, resulting in a poorly connected proton conducting phase when dry, but excellent conductivity is achieved at elevated humidities (0.298 S cm<sup>-1</sup> at 80 °C and 95% RH). The proton conductivity shows an enhancement above 60 °C due to a softening of the polymer, as shown by DSC. Under an aggressive chemical accelerated stress test (AST), 90 °C, 30% RH, zero current, and pure O<sub>2</sub>, the PolyHPA losses only 0.05 V of open circuit voltage (OCV) after 500 h, greatly out performing any other material reported in the literature. For comparison, the Nafion® N211 fuel cell drops below 0.8 V after only 76 h under the same conditions. Finally, in fuel cell testing the PolyHPAs have outstanding chemical stability and also possess very low in situ high frequency resistance (HFR) leading to high performance (1.14 W cm<sup>-2</sup> at 2 A cm<sup>-2</sup>), compared to 1.11 W cm<sup>-2</sup> for the Nafion® N211 fuel cell at the same current. At 75 wt% HSiW11 loading, the fuel cell HFR showed a 22% decrease over N211.","Royal Society of Chemistry","","Colorado School of Mines, Golden, CO (United States); Argonne National Lab.

They maintain desirable functional advantages that render them as attractive candidates for renewable energy alternatives. However, the high cost and general scarcity of conventional FC catalysts largely limit the ubiquitous application of this device configuration. For example, under current consumption requirements, there is an insufficient global reserve of Pt to provide for the needs of an effective FC for every car produced. Therefore, it is absolutely necessary in the future to replace Pt either completely or in part with far more plentiful, abundant, cheaper, and potentially less toxic first row transition metals, because the high cost-to-benefit ratio of conventional catalysts is and will continue to be a major limiting factor preventing mass commercialization. We and other groups have explored a number of nanowire-based catalytic architectures, which are either Pt-free or with reduced Pt content, as an energy efficient solution with improved performance metrics versus conventional, currently commercially available Pt nanoparticles that are already well established in the community. Specifically, in this Perspective, we highlight strategies aimed at the rational modification of not only the physical structure but also the chemical composition as a means of developing superior electrocatalysts for a number of small-molecule-based anodic oxidation and cathodic reduction reactions, which underlie the overall FC behavior. In particular, we focus on efforts to precisely, synergistically, and simultaneously tune not only the size, morphology, architectural motif, surface chemistry, and chemical composition of the as-generated catalysts but also the nature of the underlying support so as to controllably improve performance metrics of the hydrogen oxidation reaction, the methanol oxidation reaction, the ethanol oxidation reaction, and the formic acid oxidation reaction, in addition to the oxygen reduction reaction.","American Chemical Society (ACS)","","Stony Brook Univ., NY (United States); Brookhaven National Lab.

The high tunability of graphene enables substantial modulation of near-field radiative heat transfer, which, when combined with the use of resonant structures, overcomes the intrinsically broadband nature of thermal radiation. In canonical geometries, we use nonlinear optimization to show that stacked graphene sheets offer improved heat conductance contrast between “ON” and “OFF” switching states and that a >10× higher modulation is achieved between isolated graphene resonators than for parallel graphene sheets. In all cases, we find that carrier mobility is a crucial parameter for the performance of a radiative thermal switch.

It is unlikely that these cations are static, but change positions depending on operating conditions. A thorough accounting of these Co cation positions and concentrations has been impossible to obtain owing to the inability to monitor these processes in operando. Indeed, the environment (water and ion content, potential, and temperature) within a fuel cell varies widely from inlet to outlet, from anode to cathode, and from active to inactive area. Synchrotron micro-X-ray fluorescence (μ-XRF) was leveraged to directly monitor Co2+ transport in an operating H2/air MEA for the first time. A Nafion membrane was exchanged to a known Co cation capacity, and standard Pt/C electrocatalysts were utilized for both electrodes. Co Kα1 XRF maps revealed through-plane transient Co transport responses driven by cell potential and current density.

Intermediate temperature fuel cells operated at 200–300°C can simplify water and thermal managements, enable the use of non-precious or low-loading precious metal catalysts and provide insensitivity toward fuel and air impurities such as carbon monoxide. However, the performance of current intermediate temperature fuel cells is poor due to a lack of highly-conductive membrane electrolytes and optimal electrodes designed for these fuel cells. We demonstrate high-performing intermediate temperature fuel cells that use SnP<sub>2</sub>O<sub>7</sub>–polymer composite membranes and a quaternary ammonium-biphosphate ion-pair coordinated polymer electrolyte in the electrodes.

There is a need for better understanding of the morphological and compositional changes that occur to the catalyst under fuel cell operation. Here, we report in-depth characterization results of a Pt-Co electrocatalyst incorporated in the cathode of membrane electrode assemblies, which were evaluated before and after accelerated stress tests designed specifically to enhance catalyst degradation. Electron microscopy, spectroscopy, and 3D electron tomography analyses of the Pt-Co nanoparticle structures suggest that the small- and intermediate-sized Pt-Co particles, which are typically Pt-rich in the fresh condition, undergo minimal morphological changes, whereas intermediate- and larger-sized Pt-Co nanoparticles that exhibit a porous “spongy” morphology and initially have a higher Co content, transform into hollowed-out shells, which is driven by continuous leaching of Co from the Pt-Co catalysts. We further show how these primary Pt-Co nanoparticle morphologies group toward a lower Co, larger size portion of the size vs. composition distribution, and provide details of their nanoscale morphological features.","The Electrochemical Society","","Los Alamos National Lab.

Selective thermal emitters that can survive at temperatures at or above ~1000°C have the potential to greatly improve the efficiency of TPV energy conversion by restricting the emission of photons with energies below the photovoltaic (PV) cell bandgap energy. In this work, we demonstrated TPV energy conversion using a high-temperature selective emitter, dielectric filter, and 0.6 eV In<sub>0.68</sub>Ga<sub>0.32</sub>As photovoltaic cell. We fabricated a passivated platinum and alumina frequency-selective surface by conventional stepper lithography. To our knowledge, this is the first demonstration of TPV energy conversion using a metamaterial emitter. The emitter was heated to >1000°C, and converted electrical power was measured. After accounting for geometry, we demonstrated a thermal-to-electrical power conversion efficiency of 24.1±0.9% at 1055°C. We separately modeled our system consisting of a selective emitter, dielectric filter, and PV cell and found agreement with our measured efficiency and power to within 1%. Our results indicate that high-efficiency TPV generators are possible and are candidates for remote power generation, combined heat and power, and heat-scavenging applications.","Optical Society of America","","Sandia National Lab.

The active particle morphological differences between the electrode couple foster a thermo-electrochemical hysteresis, where the difference in heat generation rates changes the electrochemical response.

"Adapted tube cleaning practices to reduce particulate contamination at hydrogen fueling stations","Terlip, D.; Hartmann, K.; Martin, J.; Rivkin, Carl","30 DIRECT ENERGY CONVERSION; particulate; contamination; tubing; construction; failure","The higher rate of component failure and downtime during initial operation in hydrogen stations is not well understood. The National Renewable Energy Laboratory (NREL) has been collecting failed components from retail and research hydrogen fueling stations in California and Colorado and analyzing them using an optical zoom and scanning electron microscope. The results show stainless steel metal particulate contamination. While it is difficult to definitively know the origin of the contaminants, a possible source of the metal particulates is improper tube cleaning practices. To understand the impact of different cleaning procedures, NREL performed an experiment to quantify the particulates introduced from newly cut tubes. The process of tube cutting, threading and beveling, which is performed most often during station fabrication, is shown to introduce metal contaminants and thus is an area that could benefit from improved cleaning practices. This paper shows how these particulates can be reduced, which could prevent station downtime and costly repair. These results are from the initial phase of a project in which NREL intends to further investigate the sources of particulate contamination in hydrogen stations.","Elsevier","","National Renewable Energy Lab.

Of the relevant properties, the tortuosity factor of the electrolyte transport paths through microstructure pores is important as it limits battery maximum charge/discharge rate, particularly for energy-dense thick electrodes. Tortuosity factor however, is difficult to precisely measure, and thus its estimation has been debated frequently in the literature. Herein, three independent approaches have been applied to quantify the tortuosity factor of lithium-ion battery electrodes. The first approach is a microstructure model based on three-dimensional geometries from X-ray computed tomography (CT) and stochastic reconstructions enhanced with computationally generated carbon/binder domain (CBD), as CT is often unable to resolve the CBD. The second approach uses a macro-homogeneous model to fit electrochemical data at several rates, providing a separate estimation of the tortuosity factor. The third approach experimentally measures tortuosity factor via symmetric cells employing a blocking electrolyte. Comparisons have been made across the three approaches for 14 graphite and nickel-manganese-cobalt oxide electrodes. Analysis suggests that if the tortuosity factor were characterized based on the active material skeleton only, the actual tortuosities would be 1.35-1.81 times higher for calendered electrodes. Correlations are provided for varying porosity, CBD phase interfacial arrangement and solid particle morphology. (C) The Author(s) 2018.

In some cases, the responsible electrochemistry and charged-species transport is complex. However, to date, there are essentially no general-purpose modeling capabilities that facilitate the incorporation of thermodynamic, kinetic, and transport complexities into the simulation of electrochemical processes. A vast majority of the modeling literature uses only a few (often only one) global charge-transfer reactions, with the rates expressed using Butler-Volmer approximations. The objective of the present paper is to identify common aspects of electrochemistry, seeking a foundational basis for designing and implementing software with general applicability across a wide range of materials sets and applications. The development of new technologies should be accelerated and improved by enabling the incorporation of electrochemical complexity (e.g., multi-step, elementary charge-transfer reactions and as well as supporting ionic and electronic transport) into the analysis and interpretation of scientific results. The spirit of the approach is analogous to the role that Chemkin has played in homogeneous chemistry modeling, especially combustion. The Cantera software, which already has some electrochemistry capabilities, forms the foundation for future capabilities expansion.","The Electrochemical Society","","National Renewable Energy Lab.

Preliminary results indicate that the chitosan extracted from shrimp shells generated membranes with promising properties such as proton conductivity, which demonstrated to be even a 100 times higher than those shown by commercial chitosan membranes. The significant increase in proton conductivity can be associated with the higher number and availability of amino groups (–NH{sub 2}) in the chitosan produced in the laboratory, which presents higher DD and lower M{sub V}. It is believed that the properties of chitosan can be manipulated in such a way that it would be possible to obtain proton conductivity values closer to that presented by Nafion{sup ®}.","","","","","","United States","2018-07-15T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: Journal of Polymers and the Environment; Journal Volume: 26; Journal Issue: 7; Other Information: Copyright (c) 2018 Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature; http://www.springer-ny.com; Country of input: International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA)","","Medium: X; Size: page(s) 2964-2972","","","","Journal ID: ISSN 1566-2543; TRN: US19K3323031726","10.1007/S10924-017-1146-7","","2020-09-25T00:00:00Z","22788095","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/22788095","","Journal of Polymers and the Environment","7","26"

Here, the thermal runaway process is studied for a Li-ion and Na-ion pouch cells of similar energy density (10.5 Wh, 12 Wh, respectively) using accelerating rate calorimetry (ARC). Both cells were constructed with a z-fold configuration, with a standard shutdown separator in the Li-ion and a low-cost polypropylene (PP) separator in the Na-ion. Even with the shutdown separator, it is shown that the self-heating rate and rate of thermal runaway in Na-ion cells is significantly slower than that observed in Li-ion systems. The thermal runaway event initiates at a higher temperature in Na-ion cells. The effect of thermal runaway on the architecture of the cells is examined using X-ray microcomputed tomography, and scanning electron microscopy (SEM) is used to examine the failed electrodes of both cells. In conclusion, from examination of the respective electrodes, likely due to the carbonate solvent containing electrolyte, it is suggested that thermal runaway in Na-ion batteries (NIBs) occurs via a similar mechanism to that reported for Li-ion cells.","ASME","","National Renewable Energy Lab.

Here, using a chemically intuitive approach based on the bond-orbital theory, three anisotropic 2D group-V materials (monolayer black phosphorus, α-arsenene, and aW-antimonene) are identified as candidates for high thermoelectric energy conversion efficiency. Concepts, such as bond length, bond angle, and bond strength, are used to explain the trends in their electronic properties, such as the band gap and the effective mass. Our first principles calculations confirm that high carrier mobilities and large Seebeck coefficients can be obtained at the same time in these materials, due to complex Fermi surfaces originating from the anisotropic structures. An intuitive understanding of how the bonding character affects phonon transport is also provided with emphasis on the importance of bonding strength and bond anharmonicity. High thermoelectric performance is observed in these materials. In conclusion, our approach provides a powerful tool to identify new thermoelectric materials and evaluate their transport properties.","Royal Society of Chemistry","","Ames Lab., Ames, IA (United States)","USDOE Office of Science (SC), Basic Energy Sciences (BES) (SC-22).

Using density functional theory, we find that the formation energy of desired Ni<sup>4+</sup> sites is systematically modulated by incorporating judicious combinations of Co, Fe and non-metal phosphorus.

"Understanding activity engagement across weekdays and weekend days: A multivariate multiple discrete-continuous modeling approach","Astroza, Sebastian; Bhat, Prerna C.; Bhat, Chandra R.; Pendyala, Ram M.; Garikapati, Venu M.","30 DIRECT ENERGY CONVERSION; activity-travel demand; modeling weekly activity schedules; time allocation; multiple discrete-continuous probit model; weekday and weekend travel","This paper is motivated by the increasing recognition that modeling activity-travel demand for a single day of the week, as is done in virtually all travel forecasting models, may be inadequate in capturing underlying processes that govern activity-travel scheduling behavior. The considerable variability in daily travel suggests that there are important complementary relationships and competing tradeoffs involved in scheduling and allocating time to various activities across days of the week. Both limited survey data availability and methodological challenges in modeling week-long activity-travel schedules have precluded the development of multi-day activity-travel demand models. With passive and technology-based data collection methods increasingly in vogue, the collection of multi-day travel data may become increasingly commonplace in the years ahead. This paper addresses the methodological challenge associated with modeling multi-day activity-travel demand by formulating a multivariate multiple discrete-continuous probit (MDCP) model system. The comprehensive framework ties together two MDCP model components, one corresponding to weekday time allocation and the other to weekend activity-time allocation. By tying the two MDCP components together, the model system also captures relationships in activity-time allocation between weekdays on the one hand and weekend days on the other. Model estimation on a week-long travel diary data set from the United Kingdom shows that there are significant inter-relationships between weekdays and weekend days in activity-travel scheduling behavior. In conclusion, the model system presented in this paper may serve as a higher-level multi-day activity scheduler in conjunction with existing daily activity-based travel models.","Elsevier","","National Renewable Energy Lab.

In the present paper we show that for the case of planar circuits, for which a meaningful Hamming distance can be defined, the elements of such projector can be bounded by exponentially decreasing functions of the distance. We provide a geometrical interpretation of the projector elements in terms of determinants of Dirichlet Laplacian of the dual circuit. For the case of linearized dynamics of the circuit for which a solution is known, this can be shown to provide a light cone bound for the interaction between memristors. Furthermore, this result establishes a finite speed of propagation of signals across the network, despite the non-local nature of the system.","American Physical Society (APS)","","Los Alamos National Lab.

"A practical method to test the validity of the standard Gumbel distribution in logit-based multinomial choice models of travel behavior","Ye, Xin; Garikapati, Venu M.; You, Daehyun; Pendyala, Ram M.","30 DIRECT ENERGY CONVERSION; travel behavior models; discrete choice models; violations of distributional assumptions; test of validity of distributional assumption; multinomial logit model; multiple discrete-continuous extreme value model","Most multinomial choice models (e.g., the multinomial logit model) adopted in practice assume an extreme-value Gumbel distribution for the random components (error terms) of utility functions. This distributional assumption offers a closed-form likelihood expression when the utility maximization principle is applied to model choice behaviors. As a result, model coefficients can be easily estimated using the standard maximum likelihood estimation method. However, maximum likelihood estimators are consistent and efficient only if distributional assumptions on the random error terms are valid. It is therefore critical to test the validity of underlying distributional assumptions on the error terms that form the basis of parameter estimation and policy evaluation. In this paper, a practical yet statistically rigorous method is proposed to test the validity of the distributional assumption on the random components of utility functions in both the multinomial logit (MNL) model and multiple discrete-continuous extreme value (MDCEV) model. Based on a semi-nonparametric approach, a closed-form likelihood function that nests the MNL or MDCEV model being tested is derived. The proposed method allows traditional likelihood ratio tests to be used to test violations of the standard Gumbel distribution assumption. Simulation experiments are conducted to demonstrate that the proposed test yields acceptable Type-I and Type-II error probabilities at commonly available sample sizes. The test is then applied to three real-world discrete and discrete-continuous choice models. For all three models, the proposed test rejects the validity of the standard Gumbel distribution in most utility functions, calling for the development of robust choice models that overcome adverse effects of violations of distributional assumptions on the error terms in random utility functions.","Elsevier","","National Renewable Energy Lab.

Based on experimental findings electrolyzer systems are observed to have a high level of controllability and hence can add flexibility to the grid from demand side. Greater awareness and controllability is proposed, developed, implemented, and tested by a 'frond end controller' in real-time environment. It can optimize the operation of electrolyzer systems based on the information collected by a communication module. Real-time tests are performed to verify the performance of front end controller driven electrolyzers to provide grid support that enables greater economic revenue and grid support for hydrogen producers under dynamic conditions.

"Manipulating Ferroelectrics through Changes in Surface and Interface Properties","Balke, Nina; Ramesh, Ramamoorthy; Yu, Pu","75 CONDENSED MATTER PHYSICS, SUPERCONDUCTIVITY AND SUPERFLUIDITY; 30 DIRECT ENERGY CONVERSION; 36 MATERIALS SCIENCE; electrode interface; ferroelectrics; nanodomains; oxygen vacancies; retention; scanning probe microscopy","Ferroelectric materials are used in many applications of modern technologies including information storage, transducers, sensors, tunable capacitors, and other novel device concepts. In many of these applications, the ferroelectric properties, such as switching voltages, piezoelectric constants, or stability of nanodomains, are crucial. For any application, even for material characterization, the material itself needs to be interfaced with electrodes. On the basis of the structural, chemical, and electronic properties of the interfaces, the measured material properties can be determined by the interface. This is also true for surfaces. However, the importance of interfaces and surfaces and their effect on experiments are often neglected, which results in many dramatically different experimental results for nominally identical samples. Therefore, it is crucial to understand the role of the interface and surface properties on internal bias fields and the domain switching process. Here, the nanoscale ferroelectric switching process and the stability of nanodomains for Pb(Zr,Ti)O<sub>3</sub> thin films are investigated by using scanning probe microscopy. Interface and surface properties are modulated through the selection/redesign of electrode materials as well as tuning the surface-near oxygen vacancies, which both can result in changes of the electric fields acting across the sample, and consequently this controls the measured ferroelectric and domain retention properties. By understanding the role of surfaces and interfaces, ferroelectric properties can be tuned to eliminate the problem of asymmetric domain stability by combining the effects of different electrode materials. Lastly, this study forms an important step toward integrating ferroelectric materials in electronic devices.","American Chemical Society (ACS)","","Oak Ridge National Lab.

In light of these computational advancements, we explore design aspects of the RRDE that will help improve sensitivity of our parameter estimation procedure to experimental data.

Under specific conditions, they are capable of photoproduction of molecular hydrogen (H<sub>2</sub>). This study compares the light-energy-to-hydrogen-energy conversion efficiency (LHCE) in two heterocystous, N<sub>2</sub>-fixing cyanobacteria (wild-type Calothrix sp. strain 336/3 and the ΔhupL mutant of Anabaena sp. strain PCC 7120) and in the sulfur-deprived green alga, Chlamydomonas reinhardtii strain CC-124, after entrapment of the cells in thin Ca<sup>2+</sup>-alginate films. The experiments, performed under photoautotrophic conditions, showed higher LHCEs in the cyanobacteria as compared to the green alga. The highest efficiency of ca. 2.5% was obtained in films of the entrapped ΔhupL strain under low light condition (2.9 W m<sup>-2</sup>). Calothrix sp. 336/3 films produced H<sub>2</sub> with a maximum efficiency of 0.6% under 2.9 W m<sup>-2</sup>, while C. reinhardtii films produced H<sub>2</sub> most efficiently under moderate light (0.14% at 12.1 W m<sup>-2</sup>). Exposure of the films to light above 16 W m<sup>-2</sup> led to noticeable oxidative stress in all three strains, which increased with light intensity. The presence of oxidative stress was confirmed by increased (i) degradation of chlorophylls and some structural carotenoids (such as β-carotene), (ii) production of hydroxylated carotenoids (such as zeaxanthin), and (iii) carbonylation of proteins. We conclude that the H<sub>2</sub> photoproduction efficiency in immobilized algae and cyanobacteria can be further improved by entrapping cultures in immobilization matrices with increased permeability for gases, especially oxygen, while matrices with low porosity produced increased amounts of xanthophylls and other antioxidant compounds.","Elsevier","","National Renewable Energy Lab.

This influence in principle can be identified and quantified through development of large defect data sets which we call the defect genome, employing high-throughput <em>ab initio</em> calculations. However, high-throughput screening of material models with point defects dramatically increases the computational complexity and chemical search space, creating major impediments toward developing a defect genome. In this paper, we overcome these impediments by employing computationally tractable <em>ab initio</em> models driven by highly scalable workflows, to study formation and interaction of various point defects (e.g., O vacancies, H interstitials, and Y substitutional dopant), in over 80 cubic perovskites, for potential proton-conducting ceramic fuel cell (PCFC) applications. The resulting defect data sets identify several promising perovskite compounds that can exhibit high proton conductivity. Furthermore, the data sets also enable us to identify and explain, insightful and novel correlations among defect energies, material identities, and defect-induced local structural distortions. Finally, such defect data sets and resultant correlations are necessary to build statistical machine learning models, which are required to accelerate discovery of new materials.","American Chemical Society","","Oak Ridge National Lab.

LSM/SDCN cells are then subjected to 200 very fast thermal cycles and 20 complete redox cycles, with minimal impact to cell performance. LSM/SDCN and SDCN/SDCN cells are operated for more than 1200 h at 700 °C. The seal and cell hermeticity is maintained, and cell ohmic impedance does not change significantly during operation. Electrode polarization increases during operation, leading to significant degradation of the cell performance.

The Na-TEC is a closed system that can theoretically achieve conversion efficiencies above 45% when operating between thermal reservoirs at 1150 K and 550 K. However, thermal designs have confined previous single-stage devices to thermal efficiencies below 20%. To mitigate some of these limitations, we consider dividing the isothermal expansion into two stages; one at the evaporator temperature (1150 K) and another at an intermediate temperature (650 K–1050 K). This dual-stage Na-TEC takes advantage of regeneration and reheating, and could be amenable to better thermal management. Herein, we demonstrate how the dual-stage device can improve the efficiency by up to 8% points over the best performing single-stage device. We also establish an application regime map for the single- and dual-stage Na-TEC in terms of the power density and the total thermal parasitic loss. Generally, a single-stage Na-TEC should be used for applications requiring high power densities, whereas a dual-stage Na-TEC should be used for applications requiring high efficiency.","Elsevier","","Georgia Institute of Technology, Atlanta, GA (United States)","USDOE Office of Energy Efficiency and Renewable Energy (EERE), Renewable Power Office.

Densely packed Cu NP ensembles underwent structural transformation during electrolysis into electrocatalytically active cube-like particles intermixed with smaller nanoparticles.

Proper electrostatic design of the triple-point junction shield electrode minimizes the risk of electrical breakdown (arcing) along the insulator-cable plug interface, while the electrode shape is designed to maintain <10 MV/m at the desired operating voltage aiming at little or no field emission once conditioned. Typical electrode surface preparation involves diamond-paste polishing by skilled personnel, requiring several weeks of effort per electrode. In this work, we describe a centrifugal barrel-polishing technique commonly used for polishing the interior surface of superconducting radio frequency cavities but implemented here for the first time to polish electrodes for dc high voltage photoguns. The technique reduced polishing time from weeks to hours while providing surface roughness comparable to that obtained with diamond-paste polishing and with unprecedented consistency between different electrode samples. We present electrode design considerations and high voltage conditioning results to 360 kV (~11 MV/m), comparing barrel-polished electrode performance to that of diamond-paste polished electrodes. Here, tests were performed using a dc high voltage photogun with an inverted-geometry ceramic insulator design.","American Institute of Physics (AIP)","","Thomas Jefferson National Accelerator Facility (TJNAF), Newport News, VA (United States)","USDOE","","United States","2017-09-11T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: Review of Scientific Instruments; Journal Volume: 88; Journal Issue: 9","","Medium: ED; Size: Article No. 093303","","JLAB-ACC-17-2527; DOE/OR/23177-4193","AC05-06OR23177","Journal ID: ISSN 0034-6748; RSINAK; R&D Project: 2017-LDRD-2; TRN: US1703239","10.1063/1.4994794","","2021-07-26T00:00:00Z","1402449","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/1402449","https://www.osti.gov/servlets/purl/1402449","Review of Scientific Instruments","9","88"

ILBs with cold-side filters that transmit visible light but reflect infrared radiation back to the filament can surpass the efficiency of state-of-the- art light-emitting diodes (LEDs). However, practical challenges such as imperfect geometrical alignment (view factor) between the filament and cold-side filters can limit the maximum achievable efficiency and make the use of cold-side filters ineffective. Here in this work, we show that by combining a cold-side optical filter with a selective emitter, the effect of the imperfect view factor between the filament and filter on the system efficiency can be minimized.

Here, we report a simple, scalable method to produce well-dispersed transition metal carbide nanoparticles. We demonstrate that these, when added as an additive to the proton exchange Nafion membrane, provide significant enhancement in power density and durability over 100 hours, surpassing both the baseline Nafion and platinum-containing recast Nafion membranes. Using focused ion beam/scanning electron microscope tomography reveals the key membrane degradation mechanism. Density functional theory exposes that OH• and H• radicals adsorb more strongly from solution and reactions producing OH• are significantly more endergonic on tungsten carbide than on platinum. Consequently, tungsten carbide may be a promising catalyst in self-hydrating crossover gases while retarding desorption of and capturing free radicals formed at the cathode, resulting in enhanced membrane durability.","Nature Publishing Group","","Univ. of Delaware, Newark, DE (United States); Energy Frontier Research Centers (EFRC) (United States).

To make kinetic study in electrochemical cell more informative and relevant to the catalysts’ performance in direct ammonia fuel cells (DAFCs) operating at about 100°C, it is desirable to study the AOR kinetics at elevated temperatures. However, ammonia evaporation accelerates with increasing temperature causing decrease of ammonia concentration with time. Here, we show a feasible solution to this issue - let argon gas bubble through concentrated ammonia before entering the electrochemical cell so that the solution can be kept ammonia saturated and oxygen free. Repeatable AOR polarization curves were obtained at temperatures up to 60°C. The AOR activities are characterized by the average currents at 0.5 V versus RHE measured at 20 mV s-1 in potential cycles below the potential of peak current. For PtIr/C, the PGM mass activities are 25 A g-1 at 25°C and 225 A g<sup>-1</sup> at 60°C.

With femtosecond laser radiation, more than 40-dB enhancement of Rayleigh backscattering signal was generated in silica fibers using 300-nJ laser pulses at 250 kHz repetition rate. The laser-induced Rayleigh scattering defects were found to be stable from the room temperature to 800 °C in hydrogen gas. The Rayleigh scatter at high temperatures was correlated to the formation and modification of nanogratings in the fiber core. Using optical fibers with enhanced Rayleigh backscattering profiles as distributed temperature sensors, we demonstrated real-time monitoring of solid oxide fuel cell (SOFC) operations with 5-mm spatial resolution at 800 °C.

Stability analysis has been researched with a focus on grid disturbance rejection. The analysis shows that the conventional control method with instantaneous grid voltage feedforward (IGVF) will significantly limit the bandwidth or stability margin of a filter-less grid-connected inverter, thus make the inverter sensitive to grid disturbance. Two proposed grid voltage feedforward control methods, which require little additional computation resources, are presented to suppress the grid voltage disturbance. The design methods of control parameters are derived. The effects of the proposed feedforward methods are also compared with that of conventional IGVF. Lastly, the grid-connected experimental results of a three phase SiC based filter-less PV inverter are provided to verify and compare the proposed control methods.","IEEE","","PowerAmerica, Raleigh, NC (United States)","USDOE Office of Energy Efficiency and Renewable Energy (EERE), Energy Efficiency Office.

In this study, a new honeycomb finned heat exchanger concept was examined to evaluate its potential as a heat transfer system for hydrogen desorption. A bench scale 0.5 L vessel was equipped with the proposed heat exchanger, filled with MOF-5® adsorbent material. The heating power, required to desorb hydrogen, was provided by a 100 W electric heater placed in the center of the honeycomb structure. Two desorption tests, at room temperature and under cryogenic temperatures, were carried out to evaluate the hydrogen desorption performance of the proposed system under different operating conditions. The bench scale vessel performance was verified from both an experimental and a modeling point of view, demonstrating the ability to desorb about 45% of the adsorbed hydrogen in reduced time and applying low heating power. Further modeling analyses were also carried out showing the potential of the proposed system to reach high hydrogen discharging rates at cryogenic temperature conditions and operating pressures between 100 bar and 5 bar. The proposed adsorption system also demonstrated to be able to discharge all the available hydrogen in less than 500 s operating at cryogenic conditions and with a nominal heating power of 100 W.","Elsevier","available","Savannah River Site (SRS), Aiken, SC (United States)","USDOE Office of Energy Efficiency and Renewable Energy (EERE)","","United States","2018-03-01T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: Applied Energy; Journal Volume: 213; Journal Issue: C","","Medium: ED; Size: p. 426-434","","SRNL-STI-2018-00027","AC09-08SR22470","Journal ID: ISSN 0306-2619; PII: S0306261918300035; TRN: US1802446","10.1016/j.apenergy.2018.01.003","","2019-03-05T00:00:00Z","1426656","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/1426656","https://www.osti.gov/servlets/purl/1426656","Applied Energy","C","213"

"Mechanical reliability and life prediction of coated metallic interconnects within solid oxide fuel cells","Xu, Zhijie; Xu, Wei; Stephens, Elizabeth; Koeppel, Brian","30 DIRECT ENERGY CONVERSION; Solid oxide fuel cell (SOFC); Ferritic stainless steel interconnect; Coating; Fracture mechanics","Metallic cell interconnects (IC) made of ferritic stainless steels, i.e., iron-based alloys, have been increasingly favored in the recent development of planar solid oxide fuel cells (SOFCs) because of their advantages in excellent imperviousness, low electrical resistance, ease in fabrication, and cost effectiveness. Typical SOFC operating conditions inevitably lead to the formation of oxide scales on the surface of ferritic stainless steel, which could cause delamination, buckling, and spallation resulting from the mismatch of the coefficient of thermal expansion and eventually reduce the lifetime of the interconnect components. Various protective coating techniques have been applied to alleviate these drawbacks. In the present work, a fracture-mechanics-based quantitative modeling framework has been established to predict the mechanical reliability and lifetime of the spinel-coated, surface-modified specimens under an isothermal cooling cycle. Analytical solutions have been formulated to evaluate the scale/substrate interfacial strength and determine the critical oxide thickness in terms of a variety of design factors, such as coating thickness, material properties, and uncertainties. In conclusion, the findings then are correlated with the experimentally measured oxide scale growth kinetics to quantify the predicted lifetime of the metallic interconnects.","Elsevier","","Pacific Northwest National Lab.

However, excess heating of the PV cell from close proximity to the emitter substantially reduces the system efficiency. In this paper, we theoretically develop and numerically demonstrate an approach to fundamentally improving TPV systems that allow for a much greater separation of an emitter and a receiver. Thus, we solve the excess heating dilemma, required for achieving theoretically high efficiencies. It consists of a spherically graded index lens known as Maxwell's Fish-Eye (MFE) structure, capable of collimating hemispherical emission into a much narrower range of angles, close to the normal direction. To fully characterize the power radiation profile of the MFE, we perform finite-difference time-domain simulations for a quarter MFE and then map it onto a Gaussian beam approximation. The modeled beam properties are subsequently used to study a half MFE. In an optimized half MFE design, 90% of all thermal photons reach a receiver at a distance of 100 λ; by comparison, only 15.6% of a blackbody emitter reach a receiver in the same geometry. It is also shown that the emission achieved by a half MFE can lead to a photon recycling rate above 95% for below bandgap photons at an emitter-receiver separation of 100 λ. Finally, by applying a half MFE, the absolute TPV efficiency can be improved from 5.74% to 37.15%, which represents a significant step forward in realizing high-efficiency TPV systems.","American Institute of Physics (AIP)","","Purdue Univ., West Lafayette, IN (United States)","USDOE Office of Energy Efficiency and Renewable Energy (EERE), Renewable Power Office.

An elitist genetic algorithm combined with a hierarchical clustering and a Thevenin network reduction is implemented to compute strategic locations and aggregate demand within each area. The aggregation reduces large distribution networks having thousands of nodes to an equivalent network with few aggregated loads, thereby significantly reducing the computational burden. Furthermore, it not only helps distribution system operators in making faster operational decisions by understanding during which time of the day will be in need of flexibility, from which specific area, and in which amount, but also enables the flexibilities stemming from small distributed resources to be traded in various power/energy markets. A combination of central and local aggregation scheme where a central aggregator enables market participation, while local aggregators materialize the accepted bids, is implemented to realize this concept. The effectiveness of the proposed method is evaluated by comparing network performances with and without aggregation. Finally, for a given network configuration, steady-state performance of aggregated network is significantly accurate (≈ ±1.5% error) compared to very high errors associated with forecast of individual consumer demand.","Elsevier","","Idaho National Lab.

Improvements are demonstrated on data generated according to the DLCP theory and in measurements performed on a CuIn<sub>x</sub>Ga<sub>1–x</sub>Se<sub>2</sub> device. We argue that the improved DLCP method is especially important for non-uniform devices, which are more susceptible to noise in the capacitance data used in DLCP because they require that the amplitude of the drive level be restricted. Importantly, the analysis does not require the collection of any data other than what is typically collected during a DLCP measurement while employing fewer independent parameters than the model that is typically used in DLCP. Finally and thus, we expect that it will be readily adoptable by those who perform DLCP measurements.","American Institute of Physics (AIP)","","Univ. of Oregon, Eugene, OR (United States)","USDOE Office of Energy Efficiency and Renewable Energy (EERE), Renewable Power Office.

The ternary SnTe–MnTe and SnTe–SnSe heterostructural alloys have been demonstrated as promising materials for thermoelectric applications. In this work, the quaternary Sn<sub>1–y</sub>MnyTe<sub>1–x</sub>Se<sub>x</sub> phase space serves as a relevant model system to explore how a combination of computational and combinatorial-growth methods can be used to study equilibrium and non-equilibrium solubility limits. Results from first principle calculations indicate low equilibrium solubility for x,y < 0.05 that are in good agreement with results obtained from bulk equilibrium synthesis experiments and predict significantly higher spinodal limits. An experimental screening using sputtered combinatorial thin film sample libraries showed a remarkable increase in non-equilibrium solubility for x,y > 0.2. These theoretical and experimental results were used to guide the bulk synthesis of metastable alloys. The ability to reproduce the non-equilibrium solubility levels in bulk materials indicates that such theoretical calculations and combinatorial growth can inform bulk synthetic routes. Further, the large difference between equilibrium and non-equilibrium solubility limits in Sn<sub>1–y</sub>Mn<sub>y</sub>Te<sub>1–x</sub>Se<sub>x</sub> indicates these metastable alloys are attractive in terms of nano-precipitate formation for potential thermoelectric applications.","Royal Society of Chemistry","","National Renewable Energy Lab.

Furthermore, polarization curves in H<sub>2</sub>/air were measured and corrected for the overpotential caused by the increased MTR for low loadings on the air side due to the reduced concentration of reactant gas at the catalyst surface.

The societal cost consists of operational costs of heterogeneous driving patterns' cars, the government investments for charging deployment, and monetized environmental externalities. The optimization framework determines the timeframe needed for conventional vehicles to be replaced with BEVs. It also determines the BEVs driving range during the planning timeframe, as well as the density of public chargers deployed on a linear transportation network over time. We leverage datasets that represent U.S. household driving patterns, as well as the automobile and the energy markets, to apply the model. Results indicate that it takes 8 years for 80% of our conventional vehicle sample to be replaced with electric vehicles, under the base case scenario. The socially optimal all-electric driving range is 204 miles, with chargers placed every 172 miles on a linear corridor. All of the public chargers should be deployed at the beginning of the planning horizon to achieve greater savings over the years. Sensitivity analysis reveals that the timeframe for the socially optimal conversion of 80% of the sample varies from 6 to 12 years. The optimal decision variables are sensitive to battery pack and vehicle body cost, gasoline cost, the discount rate, and conventional vehicles' fuel economy. In conclusion, faster conventional vehicle replacement is achieved when the gasoline cost increases, electricity cost decreases, and battery packs become cheaper over the years.","Taylor & Francis","","Oak Ridge National Lab.

A new type of beta electron power source is described that removes those restrictions. This approach contains the radioisotope in a beta transparent titanium tube and confines beta electrons emitted through the tube wall to spiral trajectories around the tube with an axial magnetic field. The confined beta electrons dissipate energy though multiple interactions with surrounding excimer precursor gas atoms to efficiently generate photons. Photovoltaic cells convert the photons to electrical power. Since the beta electrons dissipate energy in the excimer precursor gas, the device can be loaded with more than 10<sup>13</sup> Bq of radioisotope to generate 100 milliwatt to watt levels of electrical power without damaging the device materials or degrading its performance. Furthermore, the power source can use a variety of beta radioisotopes and scales by stacking the devices.","Elsevier","","Princeton Plasma Physics Lab.

A modular, efficient battery simulation model -- the multiscale multidomain (MSMD) model -- was previously introduced to aid the scale-up of Li-ion material and electrode designs to complete cell and pack designs, capturing electrochemical interplay with 3-D electronic current pathways and thermal response. Here, this paper enhances the computational efficiency of the MSMD model using a separation of time-scales principle to decompose model field variables. The decomposition provides a quasi-explicit linkage between the multiple length-scale domains and thus reduces time-consuming nested iteration when solving model equations across multiple domains. In addition to particle-, electrode- and cell-length scales treated in the previous work, the present formulation extends to bus bar- and multi-cell module-length scales.

At the same time, cost also motivates the reduction in expensive precious-metal catalysts, which results in higher local transport losses in the catalyst layers. Here, we use a hydrogen-pump limiting-current setup to explore the gas-phase transport losses through PEFC catalyst layers and various gas-diffusion and microporous layers. It is shown that the effective diffusivity in the gas-diffusion layers is a strong function of liquid saturation. Additionally, it is shown how the catalyst layer unexpectedly contributes significantly to the overall measured transport resistance. This is especially true for low catalyst loadings. It is also shown how the various losses can be separated into different mechanisms including diffusional processes and mass-dependent and independent ones, where the data suggests that a large part of the transport resistance in catalyst layers cannot be attributed to a gas-phase diffusional process. The technique is promising for deconvoluting transport losses in PEFCs.","Elsevier","","Lawrence Berkeley National Lab.

Energy usage and CO<sub>2</sub> emissions from freight have historically grown with a correlation to GDP, and there is limited evidence of near-term global decoupling of freight demand from GDP. Over the 21<sup>st</sup> century, greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions from freight are projected to grow faster than passenger transportation or other major end-use sectors, with the magnitude of growth dependent on the assumed extent of long-term decoupling. In climate change mitigation scenarios that apply a price to GHG emissions, mitigation of freight emissions (including the effects of demand elasticity, mode and technology shifting, and fuel substitution) is more limited than for other demand sectors. In such scenarios, shifting to less-emitting transportation modes and technologies is projected to play a relatively small role in reducing freight emissions in GCAM. Finally, by contrast, changes in the supply chain of liquid fuels that reduce the fuel carbon intensity, especially deriving from large-scale use of biofuels coupled to carbon capture and storage technologies, are responsible for the majority of freight emissions mitigation, followed by price-induced reduction in freight demand services.","American Chemical Society (ACS)","","National Renewable Energy Lab.

The model considers losses due to mass transport, as well as biological and electrochemical reactions, in both the anode and cathode half-cells. Computational fluid dynamics and Monod-Nernst analysis are incorporated into the reactions for the anode biofilm and cathode Pt catalyst and biofilm. The integrated model provides a macro-perspective of the interrelation between the anode and cathode during power production, while incorporating microscale contributions of mass transport within the anode and cathode layers. Model considerations include the effects of pH (H<sup>+</sup>/OH<sup>–</sup> transport) and electric field-driven migration on concentration overpotential, effects of various buffers and various amounts of buffer on the pH in the whole reactor, and overall impacts on the power output of the MFC.

"The Role of Ionic Liquid Electrolyte in an Aluminum–Graphite Electrochemical Cell","Agiorgousis, Michael L.; Sun, Yi-Yang; Zhang, Shengbai","30 DIRECT ENERGY CONVERSION; 36 MATERIALS SCIENCE","Using first-principles calculations and molecular dynamics simulation, we study the working mechanism in an aluminum–graphite electrochemical cell, which was recently reported to exhibit attractive performance. We exclude the possibility of Al<sup>3+</sup> cation intercalation into graphite as in standard Li-ion batteries. Instead, we show that the AlCl<sub>4</sub><sup>–</sup> anion intercalation mechanism is thermodynamically feasible. By including the ionic liquid electrolyte in the overall redox reaction, we are able to reproduce the high voltage observed in experiment. The active involvement of electrolyte in the reaction suggests that the evaluation of energy density needs to take the electrolyte into consideration. Here, our proposed structural model is consistent with the new peaks appearing in X-ray diffraction from the intercalation compound. The high rate capability is explained by the ultralow diffusion barriers of the AlCl<sub>4</sub> intercalant. With the clarified working mechanism, it becomes clear that the high voltage of the Al–graphite cell is a result of the thermodynamic instability of the AlCl<sub>4</sub>-intercalated graphite.","American Chemical Society","","Rensselaer Polytechnic Inst., Troy, NY (United States)","USDOE Office of Science (SC), Basic Energy Sciences (BES)","","United States","2017-02-21T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: ACS Energy Letters Journal Volume: 2 Journal Issue: 3","","Medium: X; Size: p. 689-693","","","SC0002623","Journal ID: ISSN 2380-8195","10.1021/acsenergylett.7b00110","","2021-08-23T00:00:00Z","1344584","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/1344584","","ACS Energy Letters","3","2"

In this study, Platinum Group Metal-free (PGM-free) ORR catalysts based on Fe, Co, Ni, Mn and the same precursor (Aminoantipyrine, AAPyr) were synthesized using identical sacrificial support method (SSM). The catalysts were investigated for their electrochemical performance, and then integrated into an air-breathing cathode to be tested in “clean” environment and in a working microbial fuel cell (MFC). Their performances were also compared to activated carbon (AC) based cathode under similar conditions. Results showed that the addition of Mn, Fe, Co and Ni to AAPyr increased the performances compared to AC. Fe-AAPyr showed the highest open circuit potential (OCP) that was 0.307 ± 0.001 V (vs. Ag/AgCl) and the highest electrocatalytic activity at pH 7.5. On the contrary, AC had an OCP of 0.203 ± 0.002 V (vs. Ag/AgCl) and had the lowest electrochemical activity. In MFC, Fe-AAPyr also had the highest output of 251 ± 2.3 μWcm<sup>–2</sup>, followed by Co-AAPyr with 196 ± 1.5 μWcm<sup>–2</sup>, Ni-AAPyr with 171 ± 3.6 μWcm<sup>–2</sup>, Mn-AAPyr with 160 ± 2.8 μWcm<sup>–2</sup> and AC 129 ± 4.2 μWcm<sup>–2</sup>.

"Insights on the extraordinary tolerance to alcohols of Fe-N-C cathode catalysts in highly performing direct alcohol fuel cells","Sebastian, David; Serov, Alexey; Matanovic, Ivana; Artyushkova, Kateryna; Atanassov, Plamen; Arico, A. S.; Baglio, Vincenzo","36 MATERIALS SCIENCE; 30 DIRECT ENERGY CONVERSION; Material Science","Direct alcohol fuel cells (DAFCs) represent the best alternative to batteries for portable and auxiliary power units application due to the high energy density of short chain alcohols. Currently, the utilization of the best platinum group metal (PGM) cathode catalysts is limited, not only by a high cost and scarce resources, but also by the inefficient oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) when permeated alcohols adsorb on the catalytic active sites. In this work, a highly active Fe-N-C catalyst derived from the pyrolysis of nicarbazin (a nitrogen charge transfer organic salt) and an iron precursor has been investigated to get insights on the extraordinary tolerance to the presence of alcohols (methanol and ethanol) of such a PGM-free catalyst. Density functional theory (DFT) calculations demonstrate for the first time that Fe-N<sub>4</sub> and Fe-N<sub>2</sub>C<sub>2</sub> active sites preferentially adsorb oxygen with much higher energy than methanol, ethanol and products of partial ethanol oxidation (0.73–1.16 eV stronger adsorption), while nitrogen-carbon related sites (pyridinic and graphitic nitrogen) are much less selective towards ORR. Half-cell electrochemical characterization showed that the Fe-N-C catalyst overcomes Pt ORR activity in acidic medium with methanol or ethanol concentrations as low as 0.01 M. The feasibility of DAFCs operation based on high methanol (up to 17 M) and ethanol (up to 5 M) concentration thanks to the utilization of Fe-N-C cathode catalyst is demonstrated. Lastly, a new strategy is proposed for DAFCs where using Pt only at the anode and Fe-N-C at the cathode allows extending the device energy density compared to PGM-based catalysts at both electrodes.","Elsevier","","Los Alamos National Lab.

Parameters are set to fit for the interfacial energies of a typical Ni-YSZ anode, an LSM-YSZ cathode and an artificial reference electrode, respectively. The contact angles at various triple junctions and the microstructure evolutions in two dimensions are calibrated to verify the model. As a demonstration of the capabilities of the model, three dimensional microstructure evolutions are simulated applying the model to the three different electrodes. The time evolutions of grain size and triple phase boundary density are analyzed. In addition, a recently proposed bound charge successive approximation algorithm is employed to calculate the effective conductivity of the electrodes during microstructure evolution. Furthermore, the effective conductivity of all electrodes are found to decrease during the microstructure evolution, which is attributed to the increased tortuosity and the loss of percolated volume fraction of the electrode phase.","Elsevier","","National Energy Technology Lab.

"Distillation-based Droplet Modeling of Non-Ideal Oxygenated Gasoline Blends: Investigating the Role of Droplet Evaporation on PM Emissions","Burke, Stephen C.; Ratcliff, Matthew; McCormick, Robert; Rhoads, Robert; Windom, Bret","30 DIRECT ENERGY CONVERSION; 02 PETROLEUM; ethanol; spark-ignition engine; particle emissions; distillation; heat of vaporization","In some studies, a relationship has been observed between increasing ethanol content in gasoline and increased particulate matter (PM) emissions from vehicles equipped with spark ignition engines. The fundamental cause of the PM increase seen for moderate ethanol concentrations is not well understood. Ethanol features a greater heat of vaporization (HOV) than gasoline and also influences vaporization by altering the liquid and vapor composition throughout the distillation process. A droplet vaporization model was developed to explore ethanol's effect on the evaporation of aromatic compounds known to be PM precursors. The evolving droplet composition is modeled as a distillation process, with non-ideal interactions between oxygenates and hydrocarbons accounted for using UNIFAC group contribution theory. Predicted composition and distillation curves were validated by experiments. Detailed hydrocarbon analysis was applied to fuel samples and to distillate fractions, and used as input for the initial droplet composition. With composition calculated throughout the distillation, the changing HOV and other physical properties can be found using reference data. The droplet can thus be modeled in terms of energy transfer, which in turn provides the transient mass transfer, droplet temperature, and droplet diameter. Model predictions suggest that non-ideal vapor-liquid equilibrium along with an increase in HOV can alter the droplet composition evolution. Results predict that the presence of ethanol causes enrichment of the higher boiling fractions (T90+) in the aromatic components as well as lengthens the droplet lifetime. A simulation of the evaporation process in a transient environment as experienced within an engine cylinder predicts a decrease in mixing time of the heaviest fractions of the fuel prior to spark initiation, possibly explaining observations linking ethanol to PM.","SAE International","","National Renewable Energy Lab.

Forecasting the next 24 h of electrical load in a grid allows operators to plan and optimize their resources. The purpose of this study is to develop a more accurate short-term load forecasting method utilizing non-linear autoregressive artificial neural networks (ANN) with exogenous multi-variable input (NARX). The proposed implementation of the network is new: the neural network is trained in open-loop using actual load and weather data, and then, the network is placed in closed-loop to generate a forecast using the predicted load as the feedback input. Unlike the existing short-term load forecasting methods using ANNs, the proposed method uses its own output as the input in order to improve the accuracy, thus effectively implementing a feedback loop for the load, making it less dependent on external data. Using the proposed framework, mean absolute percent errors in the forecast in the order of 1% have been achieved, which is a 30% improvement on the average error using feedforward ANNs, ARMAX and state space methods, which can result in large savings by avoiding commissioning of unnecessary power plants. Finally, the New England electrical load data are used to train and validate the forecast prediction.","MDPI AG","","Univ. of Miami, Coral Gables, FL (United States)","USDOE Office of Energy Efficiency and Renewable Energy (EERE)","","United States","2017-01-01T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: Energies; Journal Volume: 10; Journal Issue: 1","","Medium: ED; Size: Article No. 40","","","EE0005545","Journal ID: ISSN 1996-1073; ENERGA; PII: en10010040","10.3390/en10010040","","2021-10-25T00:00:00Z","1347528","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/1347528","https://www.osti.gov/servlets/purl/1347528","Energies","1","10"

But, conventional methods to monitor algal physiology use a chlorophyll fluorometer whose use is hampered by high-cost, large footprint, and limited sensitivity for practical samples containing low algal concentration. In order to overcome these constraints, we developed a multi-level electrode platform for resettable trapping of algae via AC electro-osmosis (ACEO) and negative dielectrophoresis. Preliminary experiments were performed in freshwater with conductivity of 0.02 S/m. Algal trapping was demonstrated at a low voltage of 2 V. The concentration effect was experimentally verified by measuring the fluorescence intensity of algae and using hemocytometer counting chambers at the inlet and outlet of the multilevel microchannel lab-on-a-chip. An optimal frequency was found for trapping, which agrees with the frequency dependence of ACEO flow velocity. Through-flow rate and electrode dimensions were optimized as well. Trapping efficiencies within the range of 26% - 65% have been obtained. A maximum trapping rate of 182 cells/s was obtained with a flow rate of 20 l/min.

In this technique a moving battery electrode is subjected to thermal excitation and the induced temperature rise is monitored using an infra-red camera. Static and dynamic experiments with speeds up to 1.5 m min<sup>-1</sup> are performed on both cathodes and anodes and a combined micro- and macro-scale finite element thermal model of the system is developed. It is shown experimentally and through simulations that during thermal scanning the temperature profile generated in an electrode depends on both coating porosity (or area loading) and thickness. Here, it is concluded that by inverting this relation the porosity (or areal loading) can be determined, if thermal response and thickness are simultaneously measured.","Elsevier","","National Renewable Energy Lab.

"A Framework for Quantifying Measurement Uncertainties and Uncertainty Propagation in HCCI/LTGC Engine Experiments","Petitpas, Guillaume; McNenly, Matthew J.; Whitesides, Russell A.","42 ENGINEERING; 30 DIRECT ENERGY CONVERSION; 37 INORGANIC, ORGANIC, PHYSICAL AND ANALYTICAL CHEMISTRY; 02 PETROLEUM","In this study, a framework for estimating experimental measurement uncertainties for a Homogenous Charge Compression Ignition (HCCI)/Low-Temperature Gasoline Combustion (LTGC) engine testing facility is presented. Detailed uncertainty quantification is first carried out for the measurement of the in-cylinder pressure, whose variations during the cycle provide most of the information for performance evaluation. Standard uncertainties of other measured quantities, such as the engine geometry and speed, the air and fuel flow rate and the intake/exhaust dry molar fractions are also estimated. Propagating those uncertainties using a Monte Carlo simulation and Bayesian inference methods then allows for estimation of uncertainties of the mass-average temperature and composition at IVC and throughout the cycle; and also of the engine performances such as gross Integrated Mean Effective Pressure, Heat Release and Ringing Intensity. Throughout the analysis, nominal values for uncertainty inputs were taken from a well-characterized engine test facility. However, the analysis did not take into account the calibration practice of experiments run in that facility and the resulting uncertainty values are therefore not indicative of the expected accuracy of those experimental results. A future study will employ the methodology developed here to explore the effects of different calibration methods on the different uncertainty values in order to evaluate best practices for accurate engine measurements.","SAE International","","Lawrence Livermore National Lab.

"Data-driven fuel consumption estimation: A multivariate adaptive regression spline approach","Chen, Yuche; Zhu, Lei; Gonder, Jeffrey; Young, Stanley; Walkowicz, Kevin","30 DIRECT ENERGY CONVERSION; 33 ADVANCED PROPULSION SYSTEMS; data-driven analytics; fuel consumption estimation; multivariate adaptive regression spline; eco-routing","Providing guidance and information to drivers to help them make fuel-efficient route choices remains an important and effective strategy in the near term to reduce fuel consumption from the transportation sector. One key component in implementing this strategy is a fuel-consumption estimation model. In this paper, we developed a mesoscopic fuel consumption estimation model that can be implemented into an eco-routing system. Our proposed model presents a framework that utilizes large-scale, real-world driving data, clusters road links by free-flow speed and fits one statistical model for each of cluster. This model includes predicting variables that were rarely or never considered before, such as free-flow speed and number of lanes. We applied the model to a real-world driving data set based on a global positioning system travel survey in the Philadelphia-Camden-Trenton metropolitan area. Results from the statistical analyses indicate that the independent variables we chose influence the fuel consumption rates of vehicles. But the magnitude and direction of the influences are dependent on the type of road links, specifically free-flow speeds of links. Here, a statistical diagnostic is conducted to ensure the validity of the models and results. Although the real-world driving data we used to develop statistical relationships are specific to one region, the framework we developed can be easily adjusted and used to explore the fuel consumption relationship in other regions.","Elsevier","","National Renewable Energy Lab.

However, space charge barrier in the inter-electrode gap and high anode work function are major obstacles toward realizing high efficiency. Here, we demonstrate for the first time a prototype TEC using a back-gated graphene anode, a barium dispenser cathode, and a controllable inter-electrode gap as small as 17 µm, which simultaneously addresses these two obstacles. This leads to an electronic conversion efficiency of 9.8% at cathode temperature of 1000 °C, the highest reported by far. We first demonstrate that electrostatic gating of graphene by a 20 nm HfO<sub>2</sub> dielectric layer changes the graphene anode work function by 0.63 eV, as observed from the current-voltage characteristics of the TEC. Next, we show that the efficiency increases by a factor of 30.6 by reducing the gap from 1 mm down to 17 µm, after a mono-layer of Ba is deposited on graphene by the dispenser cathode. Lastlu, we show that electrostatic gating of graphene further reduces the graphene work function from 1.85 to 1.69 eV, leading to an additional 67% enhancement in TEC efficiency. Note that the overall efficiency using the back-gated graphene anode is 6.7 times higher compared with that of a TEC with a tungsten anode and the same inter-electrode gap.","Elsevier","","SLAC National Accelerator Lab., Menlo Park, CA (United States)","USDOE","","United States","2016-12-15T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: Nano Energy; Journal Volume: 32; Journal Issue: C","","Medium: ED; Size: p. 67-72","","","Howe ICLFY11-01; AC02-76SF00515","Journal ID: ISSN 2211-2855; PII: S2211285516305912","10.1016/j.nanoen.2016.12.027","","2022-05-23T00:00:00Z","1353107","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/1353107","https://www.osti.gov/servlets/purl/1353107","Nano Energy","C","32"

The PCSS based cable pulser transmits a 130 ps rise time pulse down a transmission line to a capacitively coupled diode, which acts as the terminating element of the transmission line. The temporal nature of the pulse reflected by the diode provides the reverse recovery characteristics of the diode, measured with a high bandwidth capacitive probe integrated into the cable pulser. Furthermore, this system was used to measure the reverse recovery times (including the creation and charging of the depletion region) for two Avogy gallium nitride (GaN) diodes; the initial reverse recovery time was found to be 4 ns and varied minimally over reverse biases of 50 – 100 V and forward current of 1 – 100 mA.","IEEE","","Sandia National Lab.

The experiments were designed to study the influence of organic contaminants (e.g. those from BOP materials) on the resistance of the catalyst, ionomer and membrane, and a mathematical model was developed that allowed us to separate these competing resistances from the data collected on an operating fuel cell. For this reason, based on the functional groups, four organic contaminants found in BOP materials, diethylene glycol monoethyl ether (DGMEE), diethylene glycol monoethyl ether acetate (DGMEA), benzyl alcohol (BzOH) and 2,6-diaminotoluene (2,6-DAT) were infused separately to the cathode side of the fuel cell. The cell voltage and high frequency impedance resistance was measured as a function of time. The contaminant feed was then discontinued and voltage recovery was measured. It was determined that compounds with ion exchange properties like 2,6-DAT can cause voltage loss with non-reversible recovery, so this compound was studied in more detail. Finally, the degree of voltage loss increased with an increase in concentration, and/or infusion time, and increased with a decrease in catalyst loadings.","The Electrochemical Society","","National Renewable Energy Lab.

In order to directly utilize the high gas temperatures associated with oxy-combustion and offset any oxygen separation penalties, a magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) generator has been proposed as a plant topping cycle. Accurately predicting the electrical conductivity of combustion products with the addition of potassium “seed” compound is necessary to evaluate the performance of this modern approach to MHD. In order to make these predictions, improved species collisional cross-section data (momentum transfer cross-section, MTCS) are needed at relevant conditions. A gas electrical conductivity model for use in open-cycle MHD power generation applications is presented, which makes use of updated MTCS data not represented in previous legacy publications. Based on the results of a detailed review and analysis of currently available MTCS data relevant to open-cycle MHD combustion systems, recommendations have been provided for relevant species and a gas temperature range of 1500-3500 K (~0.13-0.3 eV electron energy). Model predictions utilizing updated MTCS data are validated against limited experimental data found in literature for oxy-combustion with potassium seed compound. Model results are presented from a parametric study, which show the effect of combustion conditions and seeding on ionization processes and gas electrical conductivity, highlighting differences between modern oxy-combustion MHD systems and legacy approaches implementing air-fired combustion and high levels of preheat.","Elsevier","","National Energy Technology Lab.

However, at charge rates of 6-C, the chemical composition of the surface film changes significantly, suggesting that this change is the reason for the sharper increase in cell resistance compared to the lower charge rates. In addition, we found that surface film formation was not uniform across the electrode. Surface film was thicker and chemically different along the central band of the electrode “jelly roll”. This result is most likely attributable to an increase in temperature that results from non-uniform electrode wetting during manufacture. As a result, this non-uniform change further resulted in active material delamination from the current collector owing to chemical changes to the binder for the cell charged at 6-C.","Elsevier","","Argonne National Lab.

The model system, Moorella thermoacetica–cadmium sulfide (CdS), combines an inorganic semiconductor nanoparticle light harvester with an acetogenic bacterium to drive the photosynthetic reduction of CO<sub>2</sub> to acetic acid with high efficiency. In this work, we report insights into this unique electrotrophic behavior and propose a charge-transfer mechanism from CdS to M. thermoacetica. Transient absorption (TA) spectroscopy revealed that photoexcited electron transfer rates increase with increasing hydrogenase (H<sub>2</sub>ase) enzyme activity. On the same time scale as the TA spectroscopy, time-resolved infrared (TRIR) spectroscopy showed spectral changes in the 1,700–1,900-cm<sup>-1</sup> spectral region. The quantum efficiency of this system for photosynthetic acetic acid generation also increased with increasing H<sub>2</sub>ase activity and shorter carrier lifetimes when averaged over the first 24 h of photosynthesis. However, within the initial 3 h of photosynthesis, the rate followed an opposite trend: The bacteria with the lowest H<sub>2</sub>ase activity photosynthesized acetic acid the fastest. These results suggest a two-pathway mechanism: a high quantum efficiency charge-transfer pathway to H<sub>2</sub>ase generating H<sub>2</sub> as a molecular intermediate that dominates at long time scales (24 h), and a direct energy-transducing enzymatic pathway responsible for acetic acid production at short time scales (3 h). Lastly, this work represents a promising platform to utilize conventional spectroscopic methodology to extract insights from more complex biotic–abiotic hybrid systems.","National Academy of Sciences, Washington, DC (United States)","","Lawrence Berkeley National Lab.

"Computational Exploration of the Li-Electrode|Electrolyte Interface in the Presence of a Nanometer Thick Solid-Electrolyte Interphase Layer [Computational exploration of the Li-electrode|electrolyte interface complicated by a nanometer thin solid-electrolyte interphase (SEI) layer]","Li, Yunsong; Leung, Kevin; Qi, Yue","30 DIRECT ENERGY CONVERSION; 36 MATERIALS SCIENCE","A nanometer thick passivation layer will spontaneously form on Li-metal in battery applications due to electrolyte reduction reactions. This passivation layer in rechargeable batteries must have “selective” transport properties: blocking electrons from attacking the electrolytes, while allowing Li<sup>+</sup> ion to pass through so the electrochemical reactions can continue. The classical description of the electrochemical reaction, Li<sup>+</sup> + e → Li<sup>0</sup>, occurring at the Li-metal|electrolyte interface is now complicated by the passivation layer and will reply on the coupling of electronic and ionic degrees of freedom in the layer. We consider the passivation layer, called “solid electrolyte interphase (SEI)”, as “the most important but the least understood in rechargeable Li-ion batteries,” partly due to the lack of understanding of its structure–property relationship. In predictive modeling, starting from the ab initio level, we find that it is an important tool to understand the nanoscale processes and materials properties governing the interfacial charge transfer reaction at the Li-metal|SEI|electrolyte interface. Here, we demonstrate pristine Li-metal surfaces indeed dissolve in organic carbonate electrolytes without the SEI layer. Based on joint modeling and experimental results, we point out that the well-known two-layer structure of SEI also exhibits two different Li<sup>+</sup> ion transport mechanisms. The SEI has a porous (organic) outer layer permeable to both Li<sup>+</sup> and anions (dissolved in electrolyte), and a dense (inorganic) inner layer facilitate only Li<sup>+</sup> transport. This two-layer/two-mechanism diffusion model suggests only the dense inorganic layer is effective at protecting Li-metal in electrolytes. This model suggests a strategy to deconvolute the structure–property relationships of the SEI by analyzing an idealized SEI composed of major components, such as Li<sub>2</sub>CO<sub>3</sub>, LiF, Li<sub>2</sub>O, and their mixtures. After sorting out the Li+ ion diffusion carriers and their diffusion pathways, we design methods to accelerate the Li<sup>+</sup> ion conductivity by doping and by using heterogonous structure designs. We will predict the electron tunneling barriers and connect them with measurable first cycle irreversible capacity loss. We note that the SEI not only affects Li<sup>+</sup> and e<sup>–</sup> transport, but it can also impose a potential drop near the Li-metal|SEI interface. Our challenge is to fully describe the electrochemical reactions at the Li<sup>-</sup>metal|SEI|electrolyte interface. This will be the subject of ongoing efforts.","American Chemical Society","","Sandia National Lab. (SNL-NM), Albuquerque, NM (United States); Energy Frontier Research Centers (EFRC) (United States).

The technique uses infrared thermography to detect temperature of a nonflammable ( &lt; 4% H 2 ) reactive mixture of H 2 /O 2 in N 2 impinging and reacting on a Pt catalytic surface. In this paper, different GDE size defects (with catalyst-loading reductions of 25, 50, and 100%) are detected at various webline speeds (3.048 and 9.144 m min -1 ) and gas flowrates (32.5 or 50 standard L min -1 ). Furthermore, a model is developed and validated for the technique, and it is subsequently used to optimize operating conditions and explore the applicability of the technique to a range of defects. The model suggests that increased detection can be achieved by recting more of the impinging H 2 , which can be accomplished by placing blocking substrates on the top, bottom, or both of the GDE; placing a substrate on both results in a factor of four increase in the temperature differential, which is needed for smaller defect detection. Overall, the RIF technique is shown to be a promising route for in-line, high-speed, large-area detection of GDE defects on moving weblines.","Elsevier","","National Renewable Energy Lab.

Real-world electrocatalysts are usually based on precious metals in the form of nanoparticles due to their high surface-to-volume ratio, which enables better utilization of employed materials. Ability to tailor nanostructure of an electrocatalyst is critical in order to tune their electrocatalytic properties. Over the last decade, that has mainly been achieved through implementation of fundamental studies performed on well-defined extended surfaces with distinct single crystalline and polycrystalline structures. Based on these studies, it has been demonstrated that performance of an electrocatalyst could be significantly changed through the control of size, composition, morphology and architecture of employed nanomaterials. This review outlines the following steps in the process of rational development of an efficient electrocatalyst: 1) electrochemical properties of well-defined surfaces, 2) synthesis and characterization of different classes of electrocatalysts, and 3) correlation between physical properties (size, shape, composition and morphology) and electrochemical behavior (adsorption, electrocatalytic activity and durability) of electrocatalyst.

One of the technical challenges associated with the operation and control of the MMC-based system is to precharge the submodule (SM) capacitors to their nominal voltage during the startup process. In this paper, considering various SM circuits, a generalized precharging strategy is proposed for the MMC-based systems, which can implement soft stratup from dc or ac side. Furthermore, the proposed precharging strategy can be applicabe for various SM circuits and MMC configurations. The proposed startup strategy does not require extra measurements and/or auxiliary power supplies. The charging current is controlled by adjusting the changing rate of the number of blocked and bypassed SM capacitors. Based on the proposed startup strategy, the startup processes of MMC/MMC-HVDC systems based on various SM circuits are analyzed and a generalized startup procedure for various MMC-HVDC systems is proposed. In addition, the uncontrollable steady-state SM capacitor voltages of various MMC-based systems are analyzed and determined, potentially useful in SM design. Our performance of the proposed strategy for various MMC-HVDC systems is evaluated based on time-domain simulation studies in the PSCAD/EMTDC software environment and experimental results based on a scaled-down prototype.","IEEE","","Oak Ridge National Lab.

Our experiments indicate that the full cell capacity fade increases linearly with cycle number and results from irreversible lithium loss in the negative electrode solid electrolyte interphase (SEI) layer. The accompanying electrode potential shift reduces utilization of active material in both electrodes and causes the positive electrode to cycle at higher states-of-charge. Here, full cell impedance rise on aging arises primarily at the positive electrode and results mainly from changes at the electrode-electrolyte interface; the small growth in negative electrode impedance reflects changes in the SEI layer.

During isothermal constant-current operation at subfreezing temperatures, water forming at the cathode initially hydrates the membrane, then forms ice in the catalyst layer and/or GDL. This ice formation results in a gradual decay in voltage. High-frequency resistance initially decreases due to an increase in membrane water content and then increases over time as the contact resistance increases. The water/ice holding capacity of a fuel cell decreases with decreasing subfreezing temperature (-10°C vs. -20°C vs. -30°C) and increasing current density (0.02 A cm<sup>-2</sup> vs. 0.04 A cm<sup>-2</sup>). Ice formation monitored using in-situ high-resolution neutron radiography indicated that the ice was concentrated near the cathode catalyst layer at low operating temperatures (≈-20°C) and high current densities (0.04 A cm<sup>-2</sup>). Significant ice formation was also observed in the GDLs at higher subfreezing temperatures (≈-10°C) and lower current densities (0.02 A cm<sup>-2</sup>).

Here, we demonstrate high-performance flexible films and devices by screen printing bismuth telluride based nanocrystal inks synthesized using a microwave-stimulated wet-chemical method. Thermoelectric films of several tens of microns thickness were screen printed onto a flexible polyimide substrate followed by cold compaction and sintering. The n-type films demonstrate a peak ZT of 0.43 along with superior flexibility, which is among the highest reported ZT values in flexible thermoelectric materials.

"Systematic parameter study of a nonlinear electromagnetic energy harvester with matched magnetic orientation: Numerical simulation and experimental investigation","Deng, Wei; Wang, Ya","30 DIRECT ENERGY CONVERSION; nonlinear electromagnetic energy harvester; tri-stable; systematic study; matched magnetic orientation; systematic parameter analysis","Here, this paper reports the systematic parameter study of a tristable nonlinear electromagnetic energy harvester for ambient low-frequency vibration. Numerical simulations and experimental investigations are performed on the harvester which consists of a cantilever beam, a tip coil, two tip magnets and two external side magnets. The external side magnets are deployed symmetrically along a concave surface parallel to the trajectory of the cantilever tip with a controllable distance so that the magnetic orientation of the tip magnets are matched with that of the side magnets. Therefore, instead of the ternary position parameters (d, h, α), a binary parameters pair (d<sub>0</sub>, d) is used to characterize the position of the side magnets and the performance of the energy harvester. The magnetic force and magnetic field on the cantilever tip therefore depend on the relative distance in the tip displacement direction between the tip magnets and side magnets, but is independent of the position of the side magnets on the concave surface. The magnetic force (field)-distance relationship is measured experimentally and curve fitted to obtain explicit expressions, in order to characterize the magnetic force (field) when the side magnets are placed at varied positions along the concave surface. Numerical simulation is, then, performed to predict the electromagnetic voltage output and the bandwidth of the energy harvester. The simulation results coincided with the measured data. Significant broadband response is obtained experimentally and the maximum RMS power output is 40.2 mW at 0.45 g of excitation.

"Technological growth of fuel efficiency in european automobile market 1975–2015","Hu, Kejia; Chen, Yuche","30 DIRECT ENERGY CONVERSION; 33 ADVANCED PROPULSION SYSTEMS; fuel consumption; technology development; new cars","This paper looks at the technological growth of new car fleet fuel efficiency in the European Union between 1975 and 2015. According to the analysis results, from1975 to 2006 the fuel efficiency technology improvements were largely offset by vehicles' increased weight, engine size, and consumer amenities such as acceleration capacity. After 2006, downsizing in weight and engine capacity was observed in new car fleet, while fuel consumption decreased by 32% between 2006 and 2015. We adopt a statistical method and find that from 1975 to 2015, a 1% increase in weight would result in 0.3 to 0.5% increments in fuel consumption per 100 km, and a 1% reduction in 0-100 km/h acceleration time would increase fuel consumption by about 0.3%. Impacts of other attributes on fuel consumption are also assessed. To meet the European Union's 2021 fuel consumption target, downsizing of cars, as well as at least maintaining fuel efficiency technology growth trend observed between 2005 and 2015, are needed. Lastly, government policies on controlling improvement in acceleration performance or promoting alternative fuel vehicles are also important to achieve European Union 2021 target.","Elsevier","","National Renewable Energy Lab.

Surface-initiated polymerization that covalently bonds polybenzimidazole (PBI) polymer on the surface of graphene supports enables the uniform distribution of the Pt nanoparticles, as well as allows the sealing of the unterminated carbon bonds usually present on the edge of graphene from the chemical reduction of graphene oxide. The nanographene effectively shortens the length of channels and pores for O<sub>2</sub> diffusion/water dissipation and significantly increases the primary pore volume. Further addition of p-phenyl sulfonic functional graphitic carbon particles as spacers, increases the specific volume of the secondary pores and greatly improves O<sub>2</sub> mass transport within the catalyst layers. The developed composite cathode catalyst of Pt/PBI-nanographene (50 wt%) + SO<sub>3</sub>H-graphitic carbon black demonstrates a higher beginning of life (BOL) PEMFC performance as compared to both Pt/PBI-nanographene (50 wt%) and Pt/PBI-graphene (50 wt%) + SO<sub>3</sub>H-graphitic carbon black (GCB). Accelerated stress tests show excellent support durability compared to that of traditional Pt/Vulcan XC72 catalysts, when subjected to 10,000 cycles from 1.0 V to 1.5 V. As a result, this study suggests the promise of using PBI-nanographene + SO<sub>3</sub>H-GCB hybrid supports in fuel cells to achieve the 2020 DOE targets for transportation applications.","The Electrochemical Society","","Los Alamos National Lab.

Low-temperature proton exchange membrane (PEM) fuel cells utilizing Nafion require a high level of hydration, which limits the operating temperature to less than 100°C. In contrast, high-temperature PEM fuel cells utilizing phosphoric acid-doped polybenzimidazole can operate effectively up to 180°C; however, these devices degrade when exposed to water below 140°C. Here we present a different class of PEM fuel cells based on quaternary ammonium-biphosphate ion pairs that can operate under conditions unattainable with existing fuel cell technologies. These fuel cells exhibit stable performance at 80–160°C with a conductivity decay rate more than three orders of magnitude lower than that of a commercial high-temperature PEM fuel cell. By increasing the operational flexibility, this class of fuel cell can simplify the requirements for heat and water management, and potentially reduce the costs associated with the existing fully functional fuel cell systems.","Nature Publishing Group","","Los Alamos National Lab.

Until recently, DME had not received the same attention as alcohol fuels, such as methanol or ethanol, despite its notable advantages. These advantages include a high theoretical open-cell voltage (1.18 V at 25 °C) that is similar to that of methanol (1.21 V), much lower toxicity than methanol, and no need for the carbon–carbon bond scission that is needed in ethanol oxidation. DME is biodegradable, has a higher energy content than methanol (8.2 vs. 6.1 kWh kg<sup>–1</sup>), and, like methanol, can be synthesized from recycled carbon dioxide. Although the performance of direct DME fuel cells (DDMEFCs) has progressed over the past few years, DDMEFCs have not been viewed as fully viable. In this work, we report much improved performance from the ternary Pt<sub>55</sub>Ru<sub>35</sub>Pd<sub>10</sub>/C anode catalyst, allowing DDMEFCs to compete directly with direct methanol fuel cells (DMFCs).

Through the comparison between electrodeposited Bi films (Bi-ED) and different types of Bi NPs, we, for the first time, demonstrate the effects of catalyst’s size and surface condition on organic phase electrochemical CO<sub>2</sub> reduction. Our study reveals that the surface inhibiting layer (hydrophobic surfactants and Bi<sup>3+</sup> species) formed during the synthesis and purification process hinders the CO<sub>2</sub> reduction, leading to a 20% drop in Faradaic efficiency for CO evolution (FE<sub>CO</sub>). Bi particle size showed a significant effect on FE<sub>CO</sub> when the surface of Bi was air-oxidized, but this effect of size on FE<sub>CO</sub> became negligible on surface-activated Bi NPs. After the surface activation (hydrazine treatment) that effectively removed the native inhibiting layer, activated 36-nm Bi NPs exhibited an almost-quantitative conversion of CO<sub>2</sub> to CO (96.1% FE<sub>CO</sub>), and a mass activity for CO evolution (MA<sub>CO</sub>) of 15.6 mA mg<sup>–1</sup>, which is three-fold higher than the conventional Bi-ED, at ₋2.0 V (vs Ag/AgCl).

To assess the accuracy of these estimates, CAN-reported fuel consumption data are compared against fuel measurements from precise instrumentation. The data analyzed consisted of eight medium/heavy-duty vehicles and two medium-duty engines. Varying discrepancies between CAN fueling rates and the more accurate measurements emerged but without a vehicular trend-for some vehicles the CAN under-reported fuel consumption and for others the CAN over-reported fuel consumption. Furthermore, a qualitative real-time analysis revealed that the operating conditions under which these fueling discrepancies arose varied among vehicles. A drive cycle analysis revealed that while CAN fueling estimate accuracy differs for individual vehicles, that CAN estimates capture the relative fuel consumption differences between drive cycles within 4% for all vehicles and even more accurately for some vehicles.

For truck applications, which are currently responsible for nearly three-quarters of the total U.S. freight energy use and greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions, platooning has been identified as an early feature for connected and automated vehicles (CAVs) that could provide significant fuel savings and improved traffic safety and efficiency without radical design or technology changes compared to existing vehicles. A statistical analysis was performed based on a large collection of real-world U.S. truck usage data to estimate the fraction of total miles that are technically suitable for platooning. In particular, our analysis focuses on estimating 'platoonable' mileage based on overall highway vehicle use and prolonged high-velocity traveling, and established that about 65% of the total miles driven by combination trucks from this data sample could be driven in platoon formation, leading to a 4% reduction in total truck fuel consumption. This technical potential for 'platoonable' miles in the United States provides an upper bound for scenario analysis considering fleet willingness and convenience to platoon as an estimate of overall benefits of early adoption of connected and automated vehicle technologies. A benefit analysis is proposed to assess the overall potential for energy savings and emissions mitigation by widespread implementation of highway platooning for trucks.","","","National Renewable Energy Lab.

In order to gain a better understanding of its combustion chemistry, dimethyl ether (DME) has been used as a radical initiator to induce ignition in this highly knock resistant aromatic, and its influence on the combustion of toluene ignition was studied in both shock tube and rapid compression machines as a function of temperature (624–1459 K), pressure (20–40 atm), equivalence ratio (0.5–2.0), and blending ratio (100% toluene, 76% toluene (76T/24D), 58% toluene (58T/42D), 26% toluene (26T/74D) and 100% DME). We use several literature chemical kinetic models to interpret our experimental results. For mixtures containing high concentrations of toluene at low-temperatures none of these are capable of reproducing experiment. This then implies an incomplete understanding of the low-temperature oxidation pathways which control its ignition in our experimental reactors, and by extension, in spark- (SI) and compression-ignition (CI) engines, and an updated detailed chemical kinetic model is presented for engineering applications. Model analyses indicate that although the initial fate of the fuel is dominated by single-step H-atom abstraction reactions from both the benzylic and phenylic sites, the subsequent fate of the allylic and vinylic radicals formed is much more complex. Further experimental and theoretical endeavors are required to gain a holistic qualitative and quantitative chemical kinetics based understanding of the combustion of pure toluene, toluene blends, and commercial fuels containing other aromatic components, at temperatures of relevance to SI and CI engines.","Elsevier","","Lawrence Livermore National Lab.

"Circulating Current Suppressing Control’s Impact on Arm Inductance Selection for Modular Multilevel Converter","Li, Yalong; Jones, Edward A.; Wang, Fred","30 DIRECT ENERGY CONVERSION; Arm inductance selection; circulating current suppression control; modular multilevel converter (MMC)","Arm inductor in a modular multilevel converter (MMC) is used to limit the circulating current and dc short circuit fault current. The circulating current in MMC is dominated by second-order harmonic, which can be largely reduced with circulating current suppressing control. By analyzing the mechanism of the circulating current suppressing control, it is found that the circulating current at switching frequency becomes the main harmonic when suppression control is implemented. Unlike the second-order harmonic that circulates only within the three phases, switching frequency harmonic also flows through the dc side and may further cause high-frequency dc voltage harmonic. This article develops the theoretical relationship between the arm inductance and switching frequency circulating current, which can be used to guide the arm inductance selection. The experimental results with a downscaled MMC prototype verify the existence of the switching frequency circulating current and its relationship with arm inductance.","IEEE","","Oak Ridge National Lab.

The model exploits the existing OpenSMOKE++ computational suite to handle detailed kinetic mechanisms, providing reliable predictions of the in-cylinder auto-ignition processes. All the elements with a significant impact on the combustion performances and emissions, like turbulence, heat and mass exchanges, crevices, residual burned gases, thermal and feed stratification are taken into account. Compared to other computational approaches, this model improves the description of mixture stratification phenomena by coupling a wall heat transfer model derived from CFD application with a proper turbulence model. Furthermore, the calibration of this multi-zone model requires only three parameters, which can be derived from a non-reactive CFD simulation: these adaptive variables depend only on the engine geometry and remain fixed across a wide range of operating conditions, allowing the prediction of auto-ignition, pressure traces and pollutants. This computational framework enables the use of detail kinetic mechanisms, as well as Rate of Production Analysis (RoPA) and Sensitivity Analysis (SA) to investigate the complex chemistry involved in the auto-ignition and the pollutants formation processes. In the final sections of the paper, these capabilities are demonstrated through the comparison with experimental data.","Elsevier","","Lawrence Livermore National Lab.

We observe nanoscopic defects that would be unresolvable by traditional microscopy. They are revealed in electroluminescence maps in operating OLEDs with 50 nm spatial resolution. We find that brightest emission comes from regions with more densely packed chains. Conventional microscopy of an operating OLED would lack the resolution needed to discriminate these features, while traditional methods to resolve nanoscale features generally cannot be performed when the device is operating.

"Elucidating reactivity regimes in cyclopentane oxidation: Jet stirred reactor experiments, computational chemistry, and kinetic modeling","Al Rashidi, Mariam J.; Thion, Sebastien; Togbe, Casimir; Dayma, Guillaume; Mehl, Marco; Dagaut, Philippe; Pitz, William J.; Zador, Judit; Sarathy, S. Mani","37 INORGANIC, ORGANIC, PHYSICAL, AND ANALYTICAL CHEMISTRY; Cyclopentane; Jet stirred rector; Species profiles; Modeling; 30 DIRECT ENERGY CONVERSION; 37 INORGANIC, ORGANIC, PHYSICAL AND ANALYTICAL CHEMISTRY","This study is concerned with the identification and quantification of species generated during the combustion of cyclopentane in a jet stirred reactor (JSR). Experiments were carried out for temperatures between 740 and 1250 K, equivalence ratios from 0.5 to 3.0, and at an operating pressure of 10 atm. The fuel concentration was kept at 0.1% and the residence time of the fuel/O2/N2 mixture was maintained at 0.7 s. The reactant, product, and intermediate species concentration profiles were measured using gas chromatography and Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy. The concentration profiles of cyclopentane indicate inhibition of reactivity between 850–1000 K for φ = 2.0 and φ = 3.0. This behavior is interesting, as it has not been observed previously for other fuel molecules, cyclic or non-cyclic. A kinetic model including both low- and high-temperature reaction pathways was developed and used to simulate the JSR experiments. The pressure-dependent rate coefficients of all relevant reactions lying on the PES of cyclopentyl + O2, as well as the C–C and C–H scission reactions of the cyclopentyl radical were calculated at the UCCSD(T)-F12b/cc-pVTZ-F12//M06-2X/6-311++G(d,p) level of theory. The simulations reproduced the unique reactivity trend of cyclopentane and the measured concentration profiles of intermediate and product species. Sensitivity and reaction path analyses indicate that this reactivity trend may be attributed to differences in the reactivity of allyl radical at different conditions, and it is highly sensitive to the C–C/C–H scission branching ratio of the cyclopentyl radical decomposition.","Elsevier","","Sandia National Lab.

The Piedmont ecoregion in the eastern United States has undergone significant land use and land cover change in the past few decades. The purpose of this study was to use newly available land use and land cover change data to quantify carbon changes within the ecoregion. Land use and land cover change data (60-m spatial resolution) derived from sequential remotely sensed Landsat imagery were used to generate 960-m resolution land cover change maps for the Piedmont ecoregion. These maps were used in the Integrated Biosphere Simulator (IBIS) to simulate ecosystem carbon stock and flux changes from 1971 to 2010. Results: Results show that land use change, especially urbanization and forest harvest had significant impacts on carbon sources and sinks. From 1971 to 2010, forest ecosystems sequestered 0.25 Mg C ha<sup>-1</sup> yr<sup>-1</sup>, while agricultural ecosystems sequestered 0.03 Mg C ha<sup>-1</sup> yr<sup>-1</sup>. The total ecosystem C stock increased from 2271 Tg C in 1971 to 2402 Tg C in 2010, with an annual average increase of 3.3 Tg C yr<sup>-1</sup>. Conclusions: Terrestrial lands in the Piedmont ecoregion were estimated to be weak net carbon sink during the study period. The major factors contributing to the carbon sink were forest growth and afforestation; the major factors contributing to terrestrial emissions were human induced land cover change, especially urbanization and forest harvest. An additional amount of carbon continues to be stored in harvested wood products. If this pool were included the carbon sink would be stronger.","BioMed Central, Ltd. (BMC)","","Argonne National Lab.

Here, this article investigates the benefits of GaN devices in an LLC resonant converter and quantitatively evaluates GaN devices' capabilities to improve converter efficiency. First, the relationship of device and converter design parameters to the device loss is established based on an analytical model of LLC resonant converter operating at the resonance. Due to the low effective output capacitance of GaN devices, the GaN-based design demonstrates about 50% device loss reduction compared with the Si-based design. Second, a new perspective on the extra transformer winding loss due to the asymmetrical primary-side and secondary-side current is proposed. The device and design parameters are tied to the winding loss based on the winding loss model in the finite element analysis (FEA) simulation. Compared with the Si-based design, the winding loss is reduced by 18% in the GaN-based design. Finally, in order to verify the GaN device benefits experimentally, 400- to 12-V, 300-W, 1-MHz GaN-based and Si-based LLC resonant converter prototypes are built and tested. One percent efficiency improvement, which is 24.8% loss reduction, is achieved in the GaN-based converter.","IEEE","","Oak Ridge National Lab.

The additional oxygen vacancies created through tensile strain enhance the cobaltite’s catalytic activity toward this important reaction by over an order of magnitude, equaling that of precious-metal catalysts, including IrO2. Lastly, our findings demonstrate that strain in these oxides can dictate the oxygen stoichiometry independent of ambient conditions, allowing unprecedented control over oxygen vacancies essential in catalysis near room temperature.","American Chemical Society (ACS)","","Oak Ridge National Lab.

"Partial oxidation of step-bound water leads to anomalous pH effects on metal electrode step-edges","Schwarz, Kathleen; Xu, Bingjun; Yan, Yushan; Sundararaman, Ravishankar","30 DIRECT ENERGY CONVERSION; 25 ENERGY STORAGE; 37 INORGANIC, ORGANIC, PHYSICAL, AND ANALYTICAL CHEMISTRY","The design of better heterogeneous catalysts for applications such as fuel cells and electrolyzers requires a mechanistic understanding of electrocatalytic reactions and the dependence of their activity on operating conditions such as pH. A satisfactory explanation for the unexpected pH dependence of electrochemical properties of platinum surfaces has so far remained elusive, with previous explanations resorting to complex co-adsorption of multiple species and resulting in limited predictive power. This knowledge gap suggests that the fundamental properties of these catalysts are not yet understood, limiting systematic improvement. In this paper, we analyze the change in charge and free energies upon adsorption using density-functional theory (DFT) to establish that water adsorbs on platinum step edges across a wide voltage range, including the double-layer region, with a loss of approximately 0.2 electrons upon adsorption. We show how this as-yet unreported change in net surface charge due to this water explains the anomalous pH variations of the hydrogen underpotential deposition (H<sub>upd</sub>) and the potentials of zero total charge (PZTC) observed in published experimental data. This partial oxidation of water is not limited to platinum metal step edges, and we report the charge of the water on metal step edges of commonly used catalytic metals, including copper, silver, iridium, and palladium, illustrating that this partial oxidation of water broadly influences the reactivity of metal electrodes.","Royal Society of Chemistry","","California Institute of Technology (CalTech), Pasadena, CA (United States)","USDOE Office of Science (SC), Basic Energy Sciences (BES)","","United States","2016-05-26T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: Physical Chemistry Chemical Physics.

Conventionally, intermetallic particles are obtained through the annealing of nanoparticles of a random alloy distribution. However, this method inevitably leads to sintering of the nanoparticles and generates polydisperse samples. Here, monodisperse PdCu nanoparticles with the ordered B2 phase were synthesized by seed-mediated co-reduction using PdCu nanoparticle seeds with a random alloy distribution (A1 phase). A time-evolution study suggests that the particles must overcome a size-dependent activation barrier for the ordering process to occur. Characterization of the as-prepared PdCu B2 nanoparticles by electron microscopy techniques revealed surface segregation of Pd as a thin shell over the PdCu core. The ordered nanoparticles exhibit superior activity and durability for the oxygen reduction reaction in comparison with PdCu A1 nanoparticles. This seed-mediated co-reduction strategy produced monodisperse nanoparticles ideally suited for structure–activity studies. Moreover, the study of their growth mechanism provides insights into the size dependence of disorder–order transformations of bimetallic alloys at the nanoscale, which should enable the design of synthetic strategies toward other intermetallic systems.","American Chemical Society","","Oak Ridge National Lab.

Yttria-stabilized zirconia is perhaps the material with the most potential as an electrolyte in solid oxide fuel cells (SOFCs), owing to its stability and near-unity ionic transference number. Although there exist materials with superior ionic conductivity, they are often limited by their ability to suppress electronic leakage when exposed to the reducing environment at the fuel interface. Such electronic leakage reduces fuel cell power output and the associated chemo-mechanical stresses can also lead to catastrophic fracture of electrolyte membranes. Here we depart from traditional electrolyte design that relies on cation substitution to sustain ionic conduction. Instead, we use a perovskite nickelate as an electrolyte with high initial ionic and electronic conductivity. Since many such oxides are also correlated electron systems, we can suppress the electronic conduction through a filling-controlled Mott transition induced by spontaneous hydrogen incorporation. Using such a nickelate as the electrolyte in free-standing membrane geometry, we demonstrate a low-temperature micro-fabricated SOFC with high performance. The ionic conductivity of the nickelate perovskite is comparable to the best-performing solid electrolytes in the same temperature range, with a very low activation energy. The results present a design strategy for high-performance materials exhibiting emergent properties arising from strong electron correlations.","Nature Publishing Group","","Argonne National Lab.

Considering the high switching-speed capability of wide band-gap devices, the test results are very sensitive to the alignment of voltage and current (V-I) measurements. Also, because of the shoot-through current induced by Cdv/dt (i.e., cross-talk), the switching losses of the nonoperating switch device in a phase-leg must be considered in addition to the operating device. This paper summarizes the key issues of the DPT, including components and layout design, measurement considerations, grounding effects, and data processing. Additionally, a practical method is proposed for phase-leg switching loss evaluation by calculating the difference between the input energy supplied by a dc capacitor and the output energy stored in a load inductor. Based on a phase-leg power module built with 1200-V/50-A SiC MOSFETs, the test results show that this method can accurately evaluate the switching loss of both the upper and lower switches by detecting only one switching current and voltage, and it is immune to V-I timing misalignment errors.","IEEE","","Oak Ridge National Lab.

"The direct-current response of electrically conducting fractures excited by a grounded current source","Weiss, Chester J.; Aldridge, David F.; Knox, Hunter A.; Schramm, Kimberly A.; Bartel, Lewis C.","58 GEOSCIENCES; 30 DIRECT ENERGY CONVERSION; 4D; resistivity; finite element; fracture stimulation; geothermal","Hydraulic fracture stimulation of low permeability reservoir rocks is an established and cross–cutting technology for enhancing hydrocarbon production in sedimentary formations and increasing heat exchange in crystalline geothermal systems. Whereas the primary measure of success is the ability to keep the newly generated fractures sufficiently open, long–term reservoir management requires a knowledge of the spatial extent, morphology, and distribution of the fractures — knowledge primarily informed by microseismic and ground deformation monitoring. To minimize the uncertainty associated with interpreting such data, we investigate through numerical simulation the usefulness of direct-current (DC) resistivity data for characterizing subsurface fractures with elevated electrical conductivity by considering a geophysical experiment consisting of a grounded current source deployed in a steel cased borehole. In doing so, the casing efficiently energizes the fractures with steady current. Finite element simulations of this experiment for a horizontal well intersecting a small set of vertical fractures indicate that the fractures manifest electrically in (at least) two ways: (1) a local perturbation in electric potential proximal to the fracture set, with limited farfield expression and (2) an overall reduction in the electric potential along the borehole casing due to enhanced current flow through the fractures into the surrounding formation. The change in casing potential results in a measurable effect that can be observed far from fractures themselves. Under these conditions, our results suggest that farfield, timelapse measurements of DC potentials can be interpreted by simple, linear inversion for a Coulomb charge distribution along the borehole path, including a local charge perturbation due to the fractures. As a result, this approach offers an inexpensive method for detecting and monitoring the time-evolution of electrically conducting fractures while ultimately providing an estimate of their effective conductivity — the latter providing an important measure independent of seismic methods on fracture shape, size, and hydraulic connectivity.","Society of Exploration Geophysicists","","Sandia National Lab.

"Numerical Simulation Comparison of Two Reactor Configurations for Chemical Looping Combustion and Chemical Looping With Oxygen Uncoupling","Hamilton, Matthew A.; Whitty, Kevin J.; Lighty, JoAnn S.","30 DIRECT ENERGY CONVERSION; Energy conversion; Environmental impact; Energy systems; Energy sources; Environmental effects","Chemical looping with oxygen uncoupling (CLOU) is a carbon capture technology that utilizes a metal oxide as an oxygen carrier to selectively separate oxygen from air and release gaseous O<sub>2</sub> into a reactor where fuel, such as coal, is combusted. Previous research has addressed reactor design for CLOU systems, but little direct comparison between different reactor designs has been performed. This study utilizes Barracuda-VR® for comparison of two system configurations, one uses circulating fluidized beds (CFB) for both the air reactor (AR) and fuel reactor (FR) and another uses bubbling fluidized beds for both reactors. Initial validation of experimental and computational fluid dynamic (CFD) simulations was performed to show that basic trends are captured with the CFD code. The CFD simulations were then used to perform comparison of key performance parameters such as solids circulation rate and reactor residence time, pressure profiles in the reactors and loopseals, and particle velocities in different locations of the reactor as functions of total solids inventory and reactor gas flows. Here, using these simulation results, it was determined that the dual CFB system had larger range for solids circulation rate before choked flow was obtained. Both systems had similar particle velocities for the bottom 80% of particle mass, but the bubbling bed (BB) obtained higher particle velocities as compared to the circulating fluidized-bed FR, due to the transport riser. As a system, the results showed that the dual CFB configuration allowed better control over the range of parameters tested.","ASME","","Univ. of Utah, Salt Lake City, UT (United States)","USDOE Office of Fossil Energy (FE), Clean Coal and Carbon Management","","United States","2016-04-19T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: Journal of Energy Resources Technology; Journal Volume: 138; Journal Issue: 4","","Medium: ED; Size: Article No. 042213","","DOE-U_Utah-0025067-03","FE0025076","Journal ID: ISSN 0195-0738","10.1115/1.4033108","","2021-08-02T00:00:00Z","1593105","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/1593105","https://www.osti.gov/servlets/purl/1593105","Journal of Energy Resources Technology","4","138"

To realize their full potential, it is important to understand the role of those defects that can strongly impact material properties. In contrast to other popular 2D semiconductors (e.g., transition metal dichalcogenides MX<sub>2</sub>) for which defects typically induce harmful traps, we show that the electronic activities of defects in 2D perovskites are significantly tunable. For example, even with a fixed lattice orientation one can change the synthesis conditions to convert a line defect (edge or grain boundary) from electron acceptor to inactive site without deep gap states. Here, we show that this difference originates from the enhanced ionic bonding in these perovskites compared with MX<sub>2</sub>. The donors tend to have high formation energies and the harmful defects are difficult to form at a low halide chemical potential. Thus, we unveil unique properties of defects in 2D perovskites and suggest practical routes to improve them.","American Chemical Society","","California Institute of Technology (CalTech), Pasadena, CA (United States); Lawrence Berkeley National Lab.

To understand and explain experimental observations better, water transport in gas diffusion layers (GDLs) with macroscopically heterogeneous morphologies was simulated using a novel coupling of continuum and pore-network models. X-ray computed tomography was used to extract GDL material parameters for use in the pore-network model. The simulations were conducted to explain experimental observations associated with stacking of anode GDLs, where stacking of the anode GDLs increased the limiting current density. Through imaging, it is shown that the stacked anode GDL exhibited an interfacial region of high porosity. The coupled model shows that this morphology allowed more efficient water movement through the anode and higher temperatures at the cathode compared to the single GDL case. As a result, the cathode exhibited less flooding and hence better low temperature performance with the stacked anode GDL.","Elsevier","","Lawrence Berkeley National Lab.

"Advanced control of liquid water region in diffusion media of polymer electrolyte fuel cells through a dimensionless number","Wang, Yun; Chen, Ken S.","36 MATERIALS SCIENCE; 30 DIRECT ENERGY CONVERSION; polymer electrolyte fuel cells; phase change; non-isothermal; liquid water region; dimensionless number","In the present study, a three-dimension (3-D) model of polymer electrolyte fuel cells (PEFCs) is employed to investigate the complex, non-isothermal, two-phase flow in the gas diffusion layer (GDL). Phase change in gas flow channels is explained, and a simplified approach accounting for phase change is incorporated into the fuel cell model. It is found that the liquid water contours in the GDL are similar along flow channels when the channels are subject to two-phase flow. Here, analysis is performed on a dimensionless parameter Da<sub>0</sub> introduced in our previous paper and the parameter is further evaluated in a realistic fuel cell. We found that the GDL's liquid water (or liquid-free) region is determined by the Da<sub>0</sub> number which lumps several parameters, including the thermal conductivity and operating temperature. By adjusting these factors, a liquid-free GDL zone can be created even though the channel stream is two-phase flow. Such a liquid-free zone is adjacent to the two-phase region, benefiting local water management, namely avoiding both severe flooding and dryness.","Elsevier","","Sandia National Lab.

It is important to understand these racks' fuel consumption impacts on both individual vehicles and the national fleet because they are widely used. We estimate the national fuel consumption impacts of roof racks using a bottom-up approach. Our model incorporates real-world data and vehicle stock information to enable assessing fuel consumption impacts for several categories of vehicles, rack configurations, and usage conditions. In addition, the model draws on two new data-gathering techniques, on-line forums and crowd-sourcing. The results show that nationwide, roof racks are responsible for 0.8‰ of light duty vehicle fuel consumption in 2015, corresponding to 100 million gallons of gasoline per year. Sensitivity analyses show that results are most sensitive to the fraction of vehicles with installed roof racks but carrying no equipment. The aerodynamic efficiency of typical roof racks can be greatly improved and reduce individual vehicle fuel consumption; however, government policies to minimize extensive driving with empty racks-if successful-could save more fuel nationally.","Elsevier","","National Renewable Energy Lab.

NPC has high surface area, and an open, accessible pore structure tunable via mass density that can improve diffusion. We fabricate 2032 coin cells using NPC coated stainless-steel disk anodes, metallic Mg cathodes, and a Grignard-based electrolyte. NPC mass density is controlled during growth, ranging from 0.06–1.3 g/cm<sup>3</sup>. The specific surface area of NPC increases linearly from 1,000 to 1,700 m<sup>2</sup>/g as mass density decreases from 1.3 to 0.26 g/cm<sup>3</sup>, however, the surface area falls off dramatically at lower mass densities, implying a lack of mechanical integrity in such nanostructures. These structural characterizations correlate directly with coin cell electrochemical measurements. In particular, cyclic voltammetry (CV) scans for NPC with density ~0.5 g/cm<sup>3</sup> and BET surface area ~1500 m<sup>2</sup>/g infer the possibility of reversible Mg-ion intercalation. Higher density NPC yields capacitive behavior, most likely resulting from the smaller interplanar spacings between graphene sheet fragments and tighter domain boundaries; lower density NPC results in asymmetrical CV scans, consistent with the likely structural degradation resulting from mass transport through soft, low-density carbon materials.","The Electrochemical Society","","Sandia National Lab.

From the steady-state model, a circular relationship is found among current and voltage quantities, which can be used to evaluate the magnitudes and initial phase angles of different circulating current components. Moreover, in order to calculate the circulating current in a point-to-point MMC-based HVdc system under unbalanced grid conditions, the derivation of equivalent dc impedance of an MMC is discussed as well. According to the dc impedance model, an MMC inverter can be represented as a series connected R-L-C branch, with its equivalent resistance and capacitance directly related to the circulating current control parameters.

The membrane-electrode assembly, a key component of a fuel cell, contains a proton-conducting membrane, typically based on the perfluorosulfonic acid (PFSA) ionomer. Unfortunately, the high cost of PFSA membranes and their relatively high bromine crossover are serious drawbacks. Nanofiber composite membranes can overcome these limitations. In this work, composite membranes were prepared from electrospun dual-fiber mats containing Nafion<sup>®</sup> PFSA ionomer for facile proton transport and an uncharged polymer, polyphenylsulfone (PPSU), for mechanical reinforcement, and swelling control. After electrospinning, Nafion/PPSU mats were converted into composite membranes by softening the PPSU fibers, through exposure to chloroform vapor, thus filling the voids between ionomer nanofibers. It was demonstrated that the relative membrane selectivity, referenced to Nafion<sup>®</sup> 115, increased with increasing PPSU content, e.g., a selectivity of 11 at 25 vol% of Nafion fibers. H<sub>2</sub>-Br<sub>2</sub> fuel cell power output with a 65 m thick membrane containing 55 vol% Nafion fibers was somewhat better than that of a 150 m Nafion<sup>®</sup> 115 reference, but its cost advantage due to a four-fold decrease in PFSA content and a lower bromine species crossover make it an attractive candidate for use in H<sub>2</sub>/Br<sub>2</sub>-HBr systems.","MDPI","","TVN Systems, Inc., Lawrence, KS (United States)","USDOE Advanced Research Projects Agency - Energy (ARPA-E)","","United States","2016-02-29T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: Materials; Journal Volume: 9; Journal Issue: 3","","Medium: ED; Size: Article No. 143","","","AR0000262","Journal ID: ISSN 1996-1944; MATEG9; PII: ma9030143","10.3390/ma9030143","","2021-07-20T00:00:00Z","1257978","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/1257978","https://www.osti.gov/servlets/purl/1257978","Materials","3","9"

The specifics of the Ni-YSZ structure—including Ni/YSZ ratio, porosity, and particle size distributions—are normally selected to minimize anode polarization resistance, but they also impact long-term stability. A better understanding of how these factors influence long-term stability is important for designing more durable anodes. The effect of structural details, e.g., Ni-YSZ ratio, on Ni coarsening has not been quantified. Furthermore, prior measurements have been done by comparing evolved structures with control samples, such that sample-to-sample variations introduce errors. Here, we report a four dimensional (three spatial dimensions and time) study of Ni coarsening in Ni-YSZ anode functional layers with different Ni/YSZ ratios, using synchrotron x-ray nano-tomography. The continuous structural evolution was observed and analyzed at sub-100 nm resolution. It is shown quantitatively that increasing the Ni/YSZ ratio increases the Ni coarsening rate. This is due to both increased pore volume and a decrease in the YSZ volume fraction, such that there is more free volume and a less obtrusive YSZ network, both of which allow greater Ni coarsening. The results are shown to be in good agreement with a power-law coarsening model. The finding is critical for informing the design of SOFC electrode microstructures that limit coarsening and performance degradation.","American Institute of Physics (AIP)","","Brookhaven National Lab.

In particular cathode exposure to atmospheric air contaminants, such as humidity, can result in long-term performance degradation issues. Therefore, a fundamental understanding of the interaction between water molecules and cathodes is essential to resolve this issue and further enhance cathode durability. In order to study the effects of humidity on the oxygen reduction reaction (ORR), we used in-situ <sup>18</sup>O isotope exchange techniques to probe the exchange of water with two of themost common SOFC cathode materials, (La<sub>0.8</sub>Sr<sub>0.2</sub>)<sub>0.95</sub>MnO<sub>3±δ</sub> (LSM) and La<sub>0.6</sub>Sr<sub>0.4</sub>Co<sub>0.2</sub>Fe<sub>0.8</sub>O<sub>3-δ</sub> (LSCF). In this experiment, heavy water, D<sub>2</sub>O (with a mass/charge ratio of m/z = 20), is used to avoid the overlapping of H<sub>2</sub>O and the <sup>18</sup>O<sub>2</sub> cracking fraction, which both provide a peak at m/z = 18. A series of temperature programmed isotope exchange measurements were performed to comprehensively study the interaction of water with the cathode surface as a function of temperature, oxygen partial pressure, and water vapor concentration. The results suggest that water and O<sub>2</sub> share the same surface exchange sites, leading to competitive adsorption. Our findings show that water prefers to exchange with LSCF at lower temperatures, around 300–450°C. For LSM, O<sub>2</sub> is more favorable than water to be adsorbed on the surface and the presence of O<sub>2</sub> limits water exchange. The experimental data are summarized in a Temperature-PO<sub>2</sub> diagram to help visualize how the exchange of water on each material depends on the operating conditions.","The Electrochemical Society","","National Energy Technology Laboratory (NETL), Pittsburgh, PA, Morgantown, WV (United States); Univ. of Maryland, College Park, MD (United States)","USDOE Office of Fossil Energy (FE)","","United States","2015-12-17T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: Journal of the Electrochemical Society; Journal Volume: 163; Journal Issue: 3","","Medium: ED; Size: p.

During operation, however, cerium rapidly migrates in the PEM and into the catalyst layers (CLs). In this work, membrane electrode assemblies (MEAs) were subjected to accelerated stress tests (ASTs) under different humidity conditions. Cerium migration was characterized in the MEAs after ASTs using X-ray fluorescence. During fully humidified operation, water flux from cell inlet to outlet generated in-plane cerium gradients. Conversely, cerium profiles were flat during low humidity operation, where in-plane water flux was negligible, however, migration from the PEM into the CLs was enhanced. Humidity cycling resulted in both in-plane cerium gradients due to water flux during the hydration component of the cycle, and significant migration into the CLs. Fluoride and cerium emissions into effluent cell waters were measured during ASTs and correlated, which signifies that ionomer degradation products serve as possible counter-ions for cerium emissions. Fluoride emission rates were also correlated to final PEM cerium contents, which indicates that PEM degradation and cerium migration are coupled. Lastly, it is proposed that cerium migrates from the PEM due to humidification conditions and degradation, and is subsequently stabilized in the CLs by carbon catalyst supports.","","","Los Alamos National Lab.

The proposed secondary control scheme can remove the dc voltage deviation and improve the current sharing accuracy by using voltage-shifting and slope-adjusting approaches simultaneously. Meanwhile, the average value of droop coefficients is calculated, and then it is controlled by an additional controller included in the distributed secondary control layer to ensure that each droop coefficient converges at a reasonable value. Hence, by adjusting the droop coefficient, each participating converter has equal output impedance, and the accurate proportional load current sharing can be achieved with different line resistances. Furthermore, the current sharing performance in steady and transient states can be enhanced by using the proposed method. The effectiveness of the proposed method is verified by detailed experimental tests based on a 3 × 1 kW prototype with three interface converters.","IEEE","","Argonne National Lab.

Nafion-free catalyst layers were employed to obtain specific activities (SA) that were not perturbed (suppressed) by sulfonate anion adsorption/blocking. By using ultrathin uniform catalyst layers, O2 diffusion limitation was minimized as confirmed from the high SAs of our supported catalysts that were comparable to unsupported sputtered Pt having controlled sizes. The specific activity (SA) steeply increased for the particle sizes in the range -2-10 nm (0.8-1.8 mA/cm2Pt at 0.9 V vs. RHE) and plateaued over -10 nm to 2.7 mA/cm2Pt for bulk poly-Pt. On the basis of the activity trend for the range of particle sizes studied, it appears that the effect of carbon support on activity is negligible.

"Manganese oxide/poly(3,4-ethylenedioxythiophene) hybrid electrocatalysts for the oxygen reduction reaction in alkaline fuel cells","Lambert, Timothy N.; Vigil, Julian A.","36 MATERIALS SCIENCE; 30 DIRECT ENERGY CONVERSION","Manganese oxide/poly(3,4-ethylene-dioxythiophene) (MnO<sub>x</sub>/ PEDOT) nanostructured hybrid thin films were prepared using a simple anodic electrodeposition process from aqueous solution, and then tested for oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) activity in alkaline electrolyte using rotating disk electrode and rotating ring disk electrode methods. MnO<sub>x</sub>/PEDOT provided improvements over MnO<sub>x</sub>-only and PEDOT-only control films, with > 0.2 V decrease in onset and half-wave overpotentials, and > 1.5 times increase in terminal current density. The MnO<sub>x</sub>/PEDOT film exhibited only a slightly lower n value (n = 3.86-3.92) than the 20% Pt/C benchmark electrocatalyst (n = 3.98) across all potentials. MnO<sub>x</sub>/PEDOT also displayed a more positive half-wave potential and superior electrocatalytic selectivity for the ORR upon methanol exposure than 20% Pt/C. Here, the high activity and synergism of MnO<sub>x</sub>/PEDOT towards the ORR is attributed to effective intermixing/dispersion of the two materials, intimate substrate contact with improved charge transfer processes attained by co-electrodepositing MnO<sub>x</sub> with PEDOT and due to the increase in Mn<sup>3+</sup> content at the surface of the oxide.","Electrochemical Society","","Sandia National Lab.

For lithium-ion batteries, there is an added concern over the safety of the system in the event of mechanical failure of the cell components. In this work, we present a generic multi-scale simultaneously coupled mechanical-electrochemical-thermal model to examine the interaction between mechanical failure and electrochemical-thermal responses. We treat the battery cell as a homogeneous material while locally we explicitly solve for the mechanical response of individual components using a homogenization model and the electrochemical-thermal responses using an electrochemical model for the battery. A benchmark problem is established to demonstrate the proposed modeling framework. The model shows the capability to capture the gradual evolution of cell electrochemical-thermal responses, and predicts the variation of those responses under different short-circuit conditions.","Electrochemical Society","","National Renewable Energy Lab.

Due to prolonged operational requirements in these devices, PFSA membranes' properties change with time due to hygrothermal aging. This paper studies the evolution of PFSA structure/property relationship changes during hygrothermal aging, including chemical changes leading to changes in ion-exchange capacity (IEC), nanostructure, water-uptake behavior, conductivity, and mechanical properties. Our findings demonstrate that with hygrothermal aging, the storage modulus increases, while IEC and water content decrease, consistent with the changes in nanostructure, that is, water- and crystalline-domain spacings inferred from small- and wide-angle X-ray scattering (SAXS/WAXS) experiments. In addition, the impact of aging is found to depend on the membrane's thermal prehistory and post-treatments, although universal correlations exist between nanostructural changes and water uptake. The findings have impact on understanding lifetime, durability, and use of these and related polymers in various technologies.","Wiley","","Los Alamos National Lab.

Here in this paper, we report a combined study using STM and DFT to understand the effect of the deposition of K on the atomic and electronic structures as well as chemical activities of Cu<sub>x</sub>O/Cu(111) (x≤2). The DFT calculations show a pseudomorphic growth of K on Cu<sub>x</sub>O/Cu(111) up to 0.19 monolayer (ML) of coverage, in which K binds the surface by a strong ionic interaction with chemisorbed oxygen and relatively weak electrostatic interactions with Cu ions, the lower and upper oxygen atoms on the Cu<sub>x</sub>O rings. The simulated STM pattern based on the DFT results agrees well with the experimental observations. The deposited K has a great impact on the surface electronic structure of Cu<sub>x</sub>O/Cu(111), which induces a significant reduction in the work function and leads to a strong electron polarization on the surface. The promotion of K on the surface binding properties is selective and varies depending on the nature of the adsorbates. According to our results, K has little effect on surface acidity but it enhances the surface basicity significantly. Consequently, the presence of K does not help CO adsorption on Cu<sub>x</sub>O/Cu(111) but is able to accelerate the activation of CO<sub>2</sub>. Such a promotion depends strongly on the combinations from both geometric and electronic effects. In conclusion, our results highlight the origin of the promoting effect of alkali metals in the design of catalysts for complex reactions.","ChemPubSoc Europe","","Brookhaven National Lab.

Despite recent achievements in this respect, further progress is hindered by the poor understanding of the nature of active sites and reaction mechanisms. Herein, by characterizing representative iron-based catalysts under reactive conditions, we identify three Fe–N<sub>4</sub>-like catalytic centers with distinctly different Fe–N switching behaviors (Fe moving toward or away from the N<sub>4</sub>-plane) during the oxygen reduction reaction (ORR), and show that their ORR activities are essentially governed by the dynamic structure associated with the Fe<sup>2+/3+</sup> redox transition, rather than the static structure of the bare sites. Our findings reveal the structural origin of the enhanced catalytic activity of pyrolyzed Fe-based catalysts compared to nonpyrolyzed Fe-macrocycle compounds.

"The effect of the morphology of supported subnanometer Pt clusters on the first and key step of CO<sub>2</sub> photoreduction [Morphology effect of supported subnanometer Pt clusters on first and key step of CO<sub>2</sub> photoreduction]","Yang, Chi -Ta; Wood, Brandon C.; Bhethanabotla, Venkat R.; Joseph, Babu","30 DIRECT ENERGY CONVERSION; 36 MATERIALS SCIENCE; 77 NANOSCIENCE AND NANOTECHNOLOGY; 37 INORGANIC, ORGANIC, PHYSICAL AND ANALYTICAL CHEMISTRY; morphology; geometry; size effect; structural fluxionality; CO2 reduction; CO2 adsorption; photocatalysis; TiO2; subnanometer Pt clusters","In this study, using density functional theory calculations, we investigate the influence of size-dependent cluster morphology on the synergistic catalytic properties of anatase TiO<sub>2</sub>(101) surfaces decorated with subnanometer Pt clusters. Focusing on the formation of the key precursor in the CO<sub>2</sub> photoreduction reaction (bent CO<sub>2</sub><sup>–</sup>), we find that flatter (2D-like) Pt clusters that “wet” the TiO<sub>2</sub> surface offer significantly less benefit than 3D-like Pt clusters. We attribute the differences to three factors. First, the 3D clusters provide a greater number of accessible Pt–TiO<sub>2</sub> interfacial sites with geometries that can aid CO<sub>2</sub> bond bending and charge transfer processes. Second, binding competition among each Pt–CO<sub>2</sub> bonding interaction mitigates maximum orbital overlaps, leading to insufficient CO<sub>2</sub> binding. Third and also most interestingly, the 3D clusters tend to possess higher structural fluxionality than the flatter clusters, which is shown to correlate positively with CO2 binding strength. The preferred morphology adopted by the clusters depends on several factors, including the cluster size and the presence of oxygen vacancies on the TiO<sub>2</sub> surface; this suggests a strategy for optimizing the synergistic effect between Pt clusters and TiO<sub>2</sub> surfaces for CO<sub>2</sub> photocatalysis. Clusters of ~6–8 atoms should provide the largest benefit, since they retain the desired 3D morphology, yet are small enough to exhibit high structural fluxionality. Electronic structure analysis provides additional insight into the electronic motivations for the enhanced binding of CO<sub>2</sub> on TiO<sub>2</sub>-supported 3D Pt clusters, as well as suppressed binding on flattened, 2D-like clusters.","Royal Society of Chemistry","","Lawrence Livermore National Lab.

The high price of Pt creates a major cost barrier for large-scale implementation of polymer electrolyte membrane fuel cells. Nonprecious metal catalysts (NPMCs) represent attractive low-cost alternatives. However, a significantly lower turnover frequency at the individual catalytic site renders the traditional carbon-supported NPMCs inadequate in reaching the desired performance afforded by Pt. Unconventional catalyst design aiming at maximizing the active site density at much improved mass and charge transports is essential for the next-generation NPMC. We report here a method of preparing highly efficient, nanofibrous NPMC for cathodic oxygen reduction reaction by electrospinning a polymer solution containing ferrous organometallics and zeolitic imidazolate framework followed by thermal activation. The catalyst offers a carbon nanonetwork architecture made of microporous nanofibers decorated by uniformly distributed high-density active sites. In a single-cell test, the membrane electrode containing such a catalyst delivered unprecedented volumetric activities of 3.3 A∙cm<sup>-3</sup> at 0.9 V or 450 A∙cm<sup>-3</sup> extrapolated at 0.8 V, representing the highest reported value in the literature.

D.; Mukundan, Rangachary; Spernjak, Dusan; Langlois, David Alan; Ahluwalia, Rajesh; More, Karen L.; Grot, Steve","30 DIRECT ENERGY CONVERSION; energy sciences; fuel cell","One of the major contributors to degradation involves the electrocatalyst, including the corrosion of the carbons used as catalyst supports, which leads to changes in the catalyst layer structure. We have measured and quantified carbon corrosion during drive cycle operation and as a variation of the upper and lower potential limits used during drive cycle operation. The amount of carbon corrosion is exacerbated by the voltage cycling inherent in the drive cycle compared with constant potential operation. The potential gap between upper and lower potentials appears to be more important than the absolute operating potentials in the normal operating potential regime (0.40V to 0.95V) as changes in the measured carbon corrosion are similar when the upper potential was lower compared to raising the lower potential. Catalyst layer thinning was observed during the simulated drive cycle operation which had an associated decrease in catalyst layer porosity. This catalyst layer thinning is not due solely to carbon corrosion, although carbon corrosion likely plays a role; much of this thinning must be from compaction of the material in the catalyst layer. As a result, the decrease in catalyst layer porosity leads to additional performance losses due to mass transport losses.","Electrochemical Society","","Los Alamos National Lab.

TEM is then widely used for analyzing the catalyst nanoparticles and their carbon support. However, the ionomer inside the electrode is more difficult to be imaged. The difficulties come from the fact that the ionomer forms an ultrathin layer surrounding the carbon particles and in addition, these two components, having similar density, present no difference in contrast. In this paper, we show how the recent progresses in TEM techniques as spherical aberration (Cs) corrected HRTEM, electron tomography and X-EDS elemental mapping provide new possibilities for imaging this ionomer network and consequently to study its degradation.","Electrochemical Society","","Los Alamos National Lab.

These sensor platforms are among the most commonly used for the detection of hydrogen. The evaluation protocols were based on the methods recommended in the ISO 26142:2010 standard. Permanent alteration of the sensor response to the target analyte (H<sub>2</sub>) following exposure to potential poisons at the concentrations specified in ISO 26142 was rarely observed. Although a shift in the baseline response was often observed during exposure to the potential poisons, only in a few cases did this shift persist after removal of the contaminants. Overall, the resistance of the sensors to poisoning was good. However, a change in sensitivity to hydrogen was observed in the electrochemical platform after exposure to NO<sub>2</sub> and for a catalytic sensor during exposure to SO<sub>2</sub>. The siloxane resistance test prescribed in ISO 26142, based on exposure to 10 ppm HMDS, may possibly not properly reflect sensor robustness to siloxanes. In conclusion, further evaluation of the resistance of sensors to other Si-based contaminants and other exposure profiles (e.g., concentration, exposure times) is needed.","Elsevier","","National Renewable Energy Lab.

Neutron and X-ray powder diffraction measurements were done to determine the crystal structure and thermal stability. Moreover, the crystallographic b-axis was revealed as a fast expansion direction, while negligible thermal expansion was observed along the a-axis around the battery operating temperatures.

Several studies have been conducted, with some studies identifying an additional anti-knock benefit from HoV and others failing to arrive at the same conclusion. Consideration of these studies holistically shows that they can be grouped according to the level of fuel octane sensitivity variation within their fuel matrices. When comparing fuels of different octane sensitivity significant additional anti-knock benefits associated with HoV are sometimes observed. Studies that fix the octane sensitivity find that HoV does not produce additional anti-knock benefit. New studies were performed at ORNL and NREL to further investigate the relationship between HoV and octane sensitivity. Three fuels were formulated for the ORNL study with matched RON and octane sensitivity, but with differing HoV. Experiments with these fuels in a 1.6-liter GTDI engine showed that the fuels exhibited very similar combustion phasing under knock-limited spark advance (KLSA) conditions. Fuels having a range of RON, octane sensitivity, and HoV were tested at NREL in a single-cylinder GDI engine under conditions where octane sensitivity has little effect on knock resistance. KLSA was found to be well correlated with RON. These results reinforce the concept that HoV anti-knock effects can be viewed as a contributor to octane sensitivity. From this viewpoint, HoV effects manifest themselves as increases in octane sensitivity.","","","National Renewable Energy Lab.

Truck idling during a rest period represents zero freight efficiency and is largely done to supply accessory power for climate conditioning of the cab. The National Renewable Energy Laboratory's CoolCab project aims to reduce heating, ventilating, and air conditioning (HVAC) loads and resulting fuel use from rest period idling by working closely with industry to design efficient long-haul truck thermal management systems while maintaining occupant comfort. Enhancing the thermal performance of cab/sleepers will enable smaller, lighter, and more cost-effective idle reduction solutions. In addition, if the fuel savings provide a one- to three-year payback period, fleet owners will be economically motivated to incorporate them. For candidate idle reduction technologies to be implemented by original equipment manufacturers and fleets, their effectiveness must be quantified. To address this need, several promising candidate technologies were evaluated through experimentation and modeling to determine their effectiveness in reducing rest period HVAC loads. Load reduction strategies were grouped into the focus areas of solar envelope, occupant environment, conductive pathways, and efficient equipment. Technologies in each of these focus areas were investigated in collaboration with industry partners. The most promising of these technologies were then combined with the goal of exceeding a 30% reduction in HVAC loads. These technologies included 'ultra-white' paint, advanced insulation, and advanced curtain design. Previous testing showed more than a 35.7% reduction in air conditioning loads. This paper describes the overall heat transfer coefficient testing of this advanced load reduction technology package that showed more than a 43% reduction in heating load. Adding an additional layer of advanced insulation with a reflective barrier to the thermal load reduction package resulted in a 53.3% reduction in the overall heat transfer coefficient.","SAE International","","National Renewable Energy Lab.

"Climate Control Load Reduction Strategies for Electric Drive Vehicles in Cold Weather","Jeffers, Matthew A.; Chaney, Larry; Rugh, John P.","30 DIRECT ENERGY CONVERSION; electric vehicle; thermal load; load reduction; climate control; fuel economy","When operated, the climate control system is the largest auxiliary load on a vehicle. This load has significant impact on fuel economy for conventional and hybrid vehicles, and it drastically reduces the driving range of all electric vehicles (EVs). Heating is even more detrimental to EV range than cooling because no engine waste heat is available. Reducing the thermal loads on the heating, ventilating, and air conditioning system will extend driving range and increase the market penetration of EVs. Researchers at the National Renewable Energy Laboratory have evaluated strategies for vehicle climate control load reduction with special attention toward grid connected electric vehicles. Outdoor vehicle thermal testing and computational modeling were used to assess potential strategies for improved thermal management and to evaluate the effectiveness of thermal load reduction technologies. A human physiology model was also used to evaluate the impact on occupant thermal comfort. Experimental evaluations of zonal heating strategies demonstrated a 5.5% to 28.5% reduction in cabin heating energy over a 20-minute warm-up. Vehicle simulations over various drive cycles show a 6.9% to 18.7% improvement in EV range over baseline heating using the most promising zonal heating strategy investigated. A national-level analysis was conducted to determine the overall national impact. If all vehicles used the best zonal strategy, the range would be improved by 7.1% over the baseline heating range. This is a 33% reduction in the range penalty for heating.","SAE International","","National Renewable Energy Lab.

Along these lines, electrochemical CO<sub>2</sub> conversion technologies are attractive because they can operate with high reaction rates at ambient conditions. However, electrochemical systems require electricity, and CO<sub>2</sub> conversion processes must integrate with carbon-free, renewable-energy sources to be viable on larger scales. We utilize Au<sub>25</sub> nanoclusters as renewably powered CO<sub>2</sub> conversion electrocatalysts with CO<sub>2</sub> → CO reaction rates between 400 and 800 L of CO<sub>2</sub> per gram of catalytic metal per hour and product selectivities between 80 and 95%. These performance metrics correspond to conversion rates approaching 0.8–1.6 kg of CO<sub>2</sub> per gram of catalytic metal per hour. We also present data showing CO<sub>2</sub> conversion rates and product selectivity strongly depend on catalyst loading. Optimized systems demonstrate stable operation and reaction turnover numbers (TONs) approaching 6 × 10<sup>6</sup> mol CO<sub>2</sub> molcatalyst–1 during a multiday (36 hours total hours) CO<sub>2</sub>electrolysis experiment containing multiple start/stop cycles. TONs between 1 × 10<sup>6</sup> and 4 × 10<sup>6</sup> molCO<sub>2</sub> molcatalyst–1 were obtained when our system was powered by consumer-grade renewable-energy sources.

"Tuning the Stability of Organic Active Materials for Nonaqueous Redox Flow Batteries via Reversible, Electrochemically Mediated Li <sup>+</sup> Coordination","Carino, Emily V.; Staszak-Jirkovsky, Jakub; Assary, Rajeev S.; Curtiss, Larry A.; Markovic, Nenad M.; Brushett, Fikile R.","25 ENERGY STORAGE; 30 DIRECT ENERGY CONVERSION","We describe an electrochemically mediated interaction between Li+ and a promising active material for nonaqueous redox flow batteries (RFBs), 1,2,3,4-tetrahydro-6,7-dimethoxy-1,1,4,4-tetramethylnaphthalene (TDT), and the impact of this structural interaction on material stability during voltammetric cycling. TDT could be an advantageous organic positive electrolyte material for nonaqueous RFBs due to its high oxidation potential, 4.21 V vs Li/Li<sup>+</sup>, and solubility of at least 1.0 M in select electrolytes. Although results from voltammetry suggest TDT displays Nernstian reversibility in many nonaqueous electrolyte solutions, bulk electrolysis reveals significant degradation in all electrolytes studied, the extent of which depends on the electrolyte solution composition. Results of subtractively normalized in situ Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (SNIFTIRS) confirm that TDT undergoes reversible structural changes during cyclic voltammetry in propylene carbonate and 1,2-dimethoxyethane solutions containing Li<sup>+</sup> electrolytes, but irreversible degradation occurs when tetrabutylammonium (TBA+) replaces Li<sup>+</sup> as the electrolyte cation in these solutions. By combining the results from SNIFTIRS experiments with calculations from density functional theory, solution-phase active species structure and potential-dependent interactions can be determined. We find that Li<sup>+</sup> coordinates to the Lewis basic methoxy groups of neutral TDT and, upon electrochemical oxidation, this complex dissociates into the radical cation TDT<sup>•+</sup> and Li<sup>+</sup>. The improved cycling stability in the presence of Li<sup>+</sup> relative to TBA<sup>+</sup> suggests that the structural interaction reported herein may be advantageous to the design of energy storage materials based on organic molecules.","American Chemical Society (ACS)","","Argonne National Lab.

"Review: Fuel Volatility Standards and Spark-Ignition Vehicle Driveability","Yanowitz, Janet; McCormick, Robert L.","30 DIRECT ENERGY CONVERSION; driveability; cold weather driveability; hot weather driveability; fuel volatility","We've put spark-ignition engine fuel standards in place in order to ensure acceptable hot and cold weather driveability (HWD and CWD). Vehicle manufacturers and fuel suppliers have developed systems that meet our driveability requirements so effectively that drivers overwhelmingly find that their vehicles reliably start up and operate smoothly and consistently throughout the year. For HWD, fuels that are too volatile perform more poorly than those that are less volatile. Vapor lock is the apparent cause of poor HWD, but there is conflicting evidence in the literature as to where in the fuel system it occurs. Most studies have found a correlation between degraded driveability and higher dry vapor pressure equivalent or lower TV/L = 20, and less consistently with a minimum T50. For CWD, fuels with inadequate volatility can cause difficulty in starting and rough operation during engine warmup. The Driveability Index (DI)-a function of T10, T50, and T90-is well correlated with CWD in hydrocarbon fuels. For ethanol-containing fuels, a correction factor to the DI equation improves the correlation with CWD, although the best value for that factor has still not been determined. Ethanol increases the heat of vaporization. But, this is likely insignificant for E15 and lower concentration fuels. The impact of ethanol on driveability is likely due to its direct effect on vapor pressure at cold temperatures. For E51-E83 or flex-fuel blends, ASTM sets a minimum vapor pressure; however, published data suggest that a correction for the amount of ethanol in the fuel is needed to accurately predict CWD, possibly because ethanol has a higher lower-flammability limit.","SAE International","","National Renewable Energy Lab.

"Effect of Particle Size and Operating Conditions on Pt<sub>3</sub>Co PEMFC Cathode Catalyst Durability","Gummalla, Mallika; Ball, Sarah; Condit, David; Rasouli, Somaye; Yu, Kang; Ferreira, Paulo; Myers, Deborah; Yang, Zhiwei","30 DIRECT ENERGY CONVERSION; Pt3Co catalyst; PEM fuel cells; in-cell performance; catalyst durability","The initial performance and decay trends of polymer electrolyte membrane fuel cells (PEMFC) cathodes with Pt<sub>3</sub>Co catalysts of three mean particle sizes (4.9 nm, 8.1 nm, and 14.8 nm) with identical Pt loadings are compared. Even though the cathode based on 4.9 nm catalyst exhibited the highest initial electrochemical surface area (ECA) and mass activity, the cathode based on 8.1 nm catalyst showed better initial performance at high currents. Owing to the low mass activity of the large particles, the initial performance of the 14.8 nm Pt3Co-based electrode was the lowest. The performance decay rate of the electrodes with the smallest Pt<sub>3</sub>Co particle size was the highest and that of the largest Pt<sub>3</sub>Co particle size was lowest. Interestingly, with increasing number of decay cycles (0.6 to 1.0 V, 50 mV/s), the relative improvement in performance of the cathode based on 8.1 nm Pt<sub>3</sub>Co over the 4.9 nm Pt<sub>3</sub>Co increased, owing to better stability of the 8.1 nm catalyst. The electron microprobe analysis (EMPA) of the decayed membrane-electrode assembly (MEA) showed that the amount of Co in the membrane was lower for the larger particles, and the platinum loss into the membrane also decreased with increasing particle size. This suggests that the higher initial performance at high currents with 8.1 nm Pt<sub>3</sub>Co could be due to lower contamination of the ionomer in the electrode. Furthermore, lower loss of Co from the catalyst with increased particle size could be one of the factors contributing to the stability of ECA and mass activity of electrodes with larger cathode catalyst particles. To delineate the impact of particle size and alloy effects, these results are compared with prior work from our research group on size effects of pure platinum catalysts. The impact of PEMFC operating conditions, including upper potential, relative humidity, and temperature on the alloy catalyst decay trends, along with the EMPA analysis of the decayed MEAs, are reported.","MDPI","","Ames Lab., Ames, IA (United States)","USDOE","","United States","2015-05-29T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: Catalysts; Journal Volume: 5; Journal Issue: 2","","Medium: ED; Size: Pages 926 to 948","","","AC02-06CH11357","Journal ID: ISSN 2073-4344; CATACJ; PII: catal5020926","10.3390/catal5020926","","2021-07-19T00:00:00Z","1208946","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/1208946","https://www.osti.gov/servlets/purl/1208946","Catalysts","2","5"

"Interactions between liquid-water and gas-diffusion layers in polymer-electrolyte fuel cells","Das, Prodip K.; Santamaria, Anthony D.; Weber, Adam Z.","30 DIRECT ENERGY CONVERSION; 37 INORGANIC, ORGANIC, PHYSICAL, AND ANALYTICAL CHEMISTRY; polymer-electrolyte fuel cells; liquid-water; water-management; gas-diffusion layers","Over the past few decades, a significant amount of research on polymer-electrolyte fuel cells (PEFCs) has been conducted to improve performance and durability while reducing the cost of fuel cell systems. However, the cost associated with the platinum (Pt) catalyst remains a barrier to their commercialization and PEFC durability standards have yet to be established. An effective path toward reducing PEFC cost is making the catalyst layers (CLs) thinner thus reducing expensive Pt content. The limit of thin CLs is high gas-transport resistance and the performance of these CLs is sensitive to the operating temperature due to their inherent low water uptake capacity, which results in higher sensitivity to liquid-water flooding and reduced durability. Therefore, reducing PEFC's cost by decreasing Pt content and improving PEFC's performance and durability by managing liquid-water are still challenging and open topics of research. An overlooked aspect nowadays of PEFC water management is the gas-diffusion layer (GDL). While it is known that GDL's properties can impact performance, typically it is not seen as a critical component. In this work, we present data showing the importance of GDLs in terms of water removal and management while also exploring the interactions between liquid-water and GDL surfaces. The critical interface of GDL and gas-flow-channel in the presence of liquid-water was examined through systematic studies of adhesion forces as a function of water-injection rate for various GDLs of varying thickness. GDL properties (breakthrough pressure and adhesion force) were measured experimentally under a host of test conditions. Specifically, the effects of GDL hydrophobic (PTFE) content, thickness, and water-injection rate were examined to identify trends that may be beneficial to the design of liquid-water management strategies and next-generation GDL materials for PEFCs.","Elsevier","","Lawrence Berkeley National Lab.

To evaluate their effectiveness, these methods are assessed using a typical large capacity Li-ion pouch cell designed for EDVs from the perspective of coolant parasitic power consumption, maximum temperature rise, temperature difference in a cell, and additional weight used for the cooling system. We use a state-of-the-art Li-ion battery electro-chemical thermal model. The results show that under our assumption an air-cooling system needs 2 to 3 more energy than other methods to keep the same average temperature; an indirect liquid cooling system has the lowest maximum temperature rise; and a fin cooling system adds about 40% extra weight of cell, which weighs most, when the four kinds cooling methods have the same volume. Indirect liquid cooling is a more practical form than direct liquid cooling though it has slightly lower cooling performance.","Elsevier","","National Renewable Energy Lab.

A 200 nm 4H-SiC P{sup +}N junction is used to collect high-energy electrons. The electron source is a titanium tritide (TiH{sup 3}{sub x}) foil, or an integrated titanium tritide region formed by the diffusion of tritium into titanium. The specific activity of the source is directly measured. Dark current measured under short circuit conditions was less than 6.1 pA/cm{sup 2}. Samples measured with an external tritium foil produced an open circuit voltage of 2.09 V, short circuit current of 75.47 nA/cm{sup 2}, fill factor of 0.86, and power efficiency of 18.6%. Samples measured with an integrated source produced power efficiencies of 12%. Simulations were done to determine the beta spectrum (modified by self absorption) exiting the source and the electron hole pair generation function in the 4H-SiC. The electron-hole pair generation function in 4H-SiC was modeled as a Gaussian distribution, and a closed form solution of the continuity equation was used to analyze the cell performance. The effective surface recombination velocity in our samples was found to be 10{sup 5}–10{sup 6 }cm/s. Our analysis demonstrated that the surface recombination dominates the performance of a tritium betavoltaic device but that using a thin P{sup +}N junction structure can mitigate some of the negative effects.","","","","","","United States","2016-01-04T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: Applied Physics Letters; Journal Volume: 108; Journal Issue: 1; Other Information: (c) 2016 AIP Publishing LLC; Country of input: International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA)","","Medium: X; Size: page(s) 013505-013505.4","","","","Journal ID: ISSN 0003-6951; CODEN: APPLAB; TRN: US16A5456069542","10.1063/1.4939203","","2016-07-11T00:00:00Z","22499202","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/22499202","","Applied Physics Letters","1","108"

The TEM results suggest that the first sodiation process starts with tunnel-based Na<sup>+</sup> intercalation, experiences the formation of Na<sub>0.5</sub>MnO<sub>2</sub> as a result of tunnel degradation, and ends with the Mn<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub> phase. The inserted Na<sup>+</sup> can be partially extracted out of the sodiated products, and the following cycles are dominated by the reversible conversion reaction between Na<sub>0.</sub>5MnO<sub>2</sub> and Mn<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub>. The Mn valence evolution inside a cycling coin using alpha-MnO<sub>2</sub> nanowire electrode also exhibits partially reversible characteristic, agreeing well with the in situ TEM analysis. The sodiation is compared with lithiation in the same alpha-MnO<sub>2</sub> nanowires. Both Na<sup>+</sup> and Li<sup>+</sup> interact with the tunneled structure via a similar tunnel -driven intercalation mechanism before Mn<sup>4+</sup> is reduced to Mn<sup>3.5+</sup>. For the following deep insertion, the tunnels survive up. to LiMnO<sub>2</sub> (Mn3+) during lithiation, while the sodiation proceeds via a different mechanism that involves obvious phase transition and fast tunnel degradation after Mn's valence is below 3.5+. The difference in charge carrier insertion mechanisms can be ascribed to the strong interaction between the tunnel frame and inserted Na<sup>+</sup> possessing a larger ionic size than inserted Li<sup>+</sup>.","Elsevier","","Argonne National Lab.

"Reliability of emerging bonded interface materials for large-area attachments","Paret, Paul P.; DeVoto, Douglas J.; Narumanchi, Sreekant","30 DIRECT ENERGY CONVERSION; bonded interface; cycles-to-failure; FEM modeling; lead solder; predictive lifetime; sintered silver; thermoplastic","In this study, conventional thermal interface materials (TIMs), such as greases, gels, and phase change materials, pose bottlenecks to heat removal and have long caused reliability issues in automotive power electronics packages. Bonded interface materials (BIMs) with superior thermal performance have the potential to be a replacement to the conventional TIMs. However, due to coefficient of thermal expansion mismatches between different components in a package and resultant thermomechanical stresses, fractures or delamination could occur, causing serious reliability concerns. These defects manifest themselves in increased thermal resistance in the package. In this paper, the results of reliability evaluation of emerging BIMs for large-area attachments in power electronics packaging are reported. Thermoplastic (polyamide) adhesive with embedded near-vertical-aligned carbon fibers, sintered silver, and conventional lead solder (Sn<sub>63</sub>Pb<sub>37</sub>) materials were bonded between 50.8 mm x 50.8 mm cross-sectional footprint silicon nitride substrates and copper base plate samples, and were subjected to accelerated thermal cycling until failure or 2500 cycles. Damage in the BIMs was monitored every 100 cycles by scanning acoustic microscopy. Thermoplastic with embedded carbon fibers performed the best with no defects, whereas sintered silver and lead solder failed at 2300 and 1400 thermal cycles, respectively. Besides thermal cycling, additional lead solder samples were subjected to thermal shock and thermal cycling with extended dwell periods. A finite element method (FEM)-based model was developed to simulate the behavior of lead solder under thermomechanical loading. Strain energy density per cycle results were calculated from the FEM simulations. A predictive lifetime model was formulated for lead solder by correlating strain energy density results extracted from modeling with cycles-to-failure obtained from experimental accelerated tests. A power-law-based approach was used to formulate the - redictive lifetime model.","","","National Renewable Energy Lab.

Contrary to traditional surface catalysts, this *OH binding does not poison the multi-metal-atom site but acts as a modifying ligand that will spontaneously form in aqueous environments leading to new active sites that have higher catalytic activities.

SOFC anodes were produced by impregnating ceria–gadolinia (CGO) scaffolds with nickel nitrate solution. The scaffolds were produced from inks containing a mixture of hydrothermally-synthesised nanoparticle CGO, commercial CGO and polymeric pore formers. The scaffolds were heat-treated at either 1000 or 1300 °C, and were mechanically stable. <i>In situ</i> ultra-small X-ray scattering (USAXS) shows that the nanoparticles begin sintering around 900–1000 °C. Analysis by USAXS and scanning electron microscopy (SEM) revealed that the low temperature heat-treated scaffolds possessed higher porosity. Impregnated scaffolds were used to produce symmetrical cells, with the lower temperature heat-treated scaffolds showing improved gas diffusion, but poorer charge transfer. Using these scaffolds, lower temperature heat-treated cells of Ni–CGO/200 μm YSZ/CGO-LSCF performed better at 700 °C (and below) in hydrogen, and performed better at all temperatures using syngas, with power densities of up to 0.15 W cm<sup>-2</sup> at 800 °C. This approach has the potential to allow the use of a wider range of materials and finer control over microstructure.","Royal Society of Chemistry","","Argonne National Lab.

Perfluorinated carboxylic acids of carbon chain length C1 – C6 were found to have an impact on electrochemical surface area (ECA).

For approaching practical thermoelectric devices, the current research is focused on electronic optimization of off-stoichiometric p-type Pb{sub x}Sn{sub 1−x}Te alloys by tuning of Bi{sub 2}Te{sub 3} doping and/or SnTe alloying levels, while avoiding the less mechanically favorable Na dopant.

Furthermore, we found that adsorption was affected even at sites where the adsorbate was not in direct contact with the octamer, which we attributed to charge donation to CO<sub>2</sub> from the Ag/Pt-modified surface, as well as an electrostatic competition between attractive (Ti–O) and repulsive (Ti–C) interactions. Additionally, TiO<sub>2</sub>-supported Pt octamers offer key advantages that could be leveraged for CO<sub>2</sub> photoreduction, including providing additional stable adsorption sites for bent CO<sub>2</sub> species and facilitating charge transfer to aid in CO<sub>2</sub>– anion formation. Electronic structure analysis suggests these factors arise primarily from the hybridization of the bonding molecular orbitals of CO<sub>2</sub> with d orbitals of the Pt atoms. Our results show that, for adsorption on TiO<sub>2</sub>-supported Pt octamers, the O–C–O bending and C–O asymmetric stretching frequencies can be used as reliable indicators of the presence of the CO<sub>2</sub>– anion intermediate as well as to distinguish unique adsorption geometries or sites. Finally, we suggest a possible pathway for subsequent CO<sub>2</sub> dissociation to CO at the surface of a reduced anatase TiO<sub>2</sub> (101)-supported Pt octamer, which has a computed energy barrier of 1.01 eV.","American Chemical Society","","Lawrence Livermore National Lab.

However, its interaction with the photosynthetic electron transport chain remains unclear. By GFP-tagging the HoxF diaphorase subunit we show that the hydrogenase is thylakoid associated, comprising a population dispersed uniformly through the thylakoids and a subpopulation localized to discrete puncta in the distal thylakoid. Thylakoid localisation of both the HoxH and HoxY hydrogenase subunits is confirmed by immunogold electron microscopy. The diaphorase HoxE subunit is essential for recruitment to the dispersed thylakoid population, potentially anchoring the hydrogenase to the membrane, but aggregation to puncta occurs through a distinct HoxE-independent mechanism. Membrane association does not require NDH-1. Localization is dynamic on a scale of minutes, with anoxia and high light inducing a significant redistribution between these populations in favour of puncta. Lastly, since HoxE is essential for access to its electron donor, electron supply to the hydrogenase depends on a physiologically controlled localization, potentially offering a new avenue to enhance photosynthetic hydrogen production by exploiting localization/aggregation signals.","Royal Society of Chemistry","","National Renewable Energy Lab.

The present study analyzes simulations of hydrated perfluorosulfonic acid (PFSA) membranes in order to determine whether PT is also subdiffusive in these important amphiphilic systems. Here, we show that PT is indeed subdiffusive for several hundred picoseconds for all hydration levels examined, and the subdiffusive behavior is highly dependent on water concentration. We also investigate the caging of the excess proton using a recently developed technique and show that the excess proton exhibits caging effects up to at least 1 ns in PFSA systems. In order to fully characterize the long-time behavior of PT in PFSAs, these results demonstrate that multiple nanosecond trajectories are needed, well beyond the current capabilities of ab initio molecular dynamics.","American Chemical Society","","Univ. of Chicago, IL (United States)","USDOE Office of Science (SC), Basic Energy Sciences (BES).

Introducing xylAB into an ethylene-producing strain increased the rate of ethylene production in the presence of xylose. Additionally, introduction of xylAB into a glycogen-synthesis mutant enhanced production of keto acids.

NPMCs present an opportunity to dramatically reduce the cost of PEFC electrodes by removing the costly Pt catalyst. To address the significant transport losses in thick NPMC cathodes (ca. >60 µm), we developed a hierarchical electrode model that resolves the unique structure of the NPMCs we studied. A unique feature of the approach is the integration of the model with morphology data extracted from nano-scale resolution X-ray computed tomography (nano-CT) imaging of the electrodes.

"A Multicomponent Blend as a Diesel Fuel Surrogate for Compression Ignition Engine Applications","Pei, Yuanjiang; Mehl, Marco; Liu, Wei; Lu, Tianfeng; Pitz, William J.; Som, Sibendu","30 DIRECT ENERGY CONVERSION; 37 INORGANIC, ORGANIC, PHYSICAL AND ANALYTICAL CHEMISTRY","A mixture of n-dodecane and m-xylene is investigated as a diesel fuel surrogate for compression ignition engine applications. Compared to neat n-dodecane, this binary mixture is more representative of diesel fuel because it contains an alkyl-benzene which represents an important chemical class present in diesel fuels. A detailed multi-component mechanism for n-dodecane and m-xylene was developed by combining a previously developed n-dodecane mechanism with a recently developed mechanism for xylenes. The xylene mechanism is shown to reproduce experimental ignition data from a rapid compression machine and shock tube, speciation data from the jet stirred reactor and flame speed data. This combined mechanism was validated by comparing predictions from the model with experimental data for ignition in shock tubes and for reactivity in a flow reactor. The combined mechanism, consisting of 2885 species and 11754 reactions, was reduced to a skeletal mechanism consisting 163 species and 887 reactions for 3D diesel engine simulations. The mechanism reduction was performed using directed relation graph (DRG) with expert knowledge (DRG-X) and DRG-aided sensitivity analysis (DRGASA) at a fixed fuel composition of 77% of n-dodecane and 23% m-xylene by volume. The sample space for the reduction covered pressure of 1 – 80 bar, equivalence ratio of 0.5 – 2.0, and initial temperature of 700 – 1600 K for ignition. The skeletal mechanism was compared with the detailed mechanism for ignition and flow reactor predictions. Finally, the skeletal mechanism was validated against a spray flame dataset under diesel engine conditions documented on the Engine Combustion Network (ECN) website. These multidimensional simulations were performed using a Representative Interactive Flame (RIF) turbulent combustion model. In conclusion, encouraging results were obtained compared to the experiments with regards to the predictions of ignition delay and lift-off length at different ambient temperatures.","ASME","","Lawrence Livermore National Lab.

"Experimental and modeling study of fuel interactions with an alkyl nitrate cetane enhancer, 2-ethyl-hexyl nitrate","Goldsborough, S. S.; Johnson, M. V.; Banyon, C.; Pitz, W. J.; McNenly, M. J.","30 DIRECT ENERGY CONVERSION; 37 INORGANIC, ORGANIC, PHYSICAL AND ANALYTICAL CHEMISTRY; Rapid compression machine; Cetane enhancer; Alkyl nitrates; Fuel interactions","Our study investigates the autoignition behavior of two gasoline surrogates doped with an alkyl nitrate cetane enhancer, 2-ethyl-hexyl nitrate (2EHN) to better understand dopant interactions with the fuels, including influences of accelerating kinetic pathways and enhanced exothermicity. A primary reference fuel (PRF) blend of n-heptane/iso-octane, and a toluene reference fuel (TRF) blend of n-heptane/iso-octane/toluene are used where the aromatic fraction of the latter is set to 20% (liquid volume), while the content of n-heptane is adjusted so that the overall reactivity of the undoped fuels is similar, e.g., Anti-Knock Index (AKI) of similar to 91, Cetane Number (CN) similar to 25. Doping levels of 0.1, 1.0 and 3.0% (liquid volume basis) are used where tests are conducted within a rapid compression machine (RCM) at a compressed pressure of 21 bar, covering temperatures from 675 to 1025 K with stoichiometric fuel-oxygen ratios at O-2 = 11.4%. At the experimental conditions, it is found that the doping effectiveness of 2EHN is fairly similar between the two fuels, though 2EHN is more effective in the aromatic blend at the lowest temperatures, while it is slightly more effective in the non-aromatic blend at intermediate temperatures. Furthermore, kinetic modeling of the experiments indicates that although some of the reactivity trends can be captured using a detailed model, the extents of predicted Cetane Number enhancement by 2EHN are too large, while differences in fuel interactions for the two fuels result in excessive stimulation of the non-aromatic blend. Sensitivity analysis using the kinetic model indicates that the CH<sub>2</sub>O and CH<sub>3</sub>O<sub>2</sub> chemistry are very sensitive to the dopant at all conditions. The rate of 2EHN decomposition is only important at low temperatures where its decomposition rate is slow due to the high activation energy of the reaction. At higher temperatures, dopant-derived 3-heptyl radicals are predicted to play an important role stimulating ignition. Finally, nitrogen chemistry is important through the 'NO - NO<sub>2</sub> loop' where this can generate substantial amounts of OH. But, at the highest doping levels the formation of methyl and ethyl nitrite, and nitric acid significantly competes with this so that less OH is generated and this constrains the reactivity enhancement of 2EHN.","Elsevier","","Lawrence Livermore National Lab.

The prototype was originally outfitted with plasma lights and then with light-emitting diode (LED) luminaires. Light output and distribution, lighting energy efficiency (i.e., efficacy), power source thermal efficiency, and fuel costs are compared. The metal halide luminaires have 2.2 and 3.1 times more light output than the plasma and LED luminaires, respectively, but they require more power/lumen to provide that output. The LED luminaires have 1.6 times better light efficacy than either the metal halide or plasma luminaires. The light uniformity ratios produced by the plasma and LED towers are acceptable. The fuel cell thermal efficiency at the power required to operate the plasma lights is 48%, significantly higher than the diesel generator efficiency of 23% when operating the metal halide lights. Due to the increased efficiency of the fuel cell and the LED lighting, the fuel cost per lumen-hour of the H2LT is 62% of the metal halide diesel light tower assuming a kilogram of hydrogen is twice the cost of a gallon of diesel fuel.","Taylor and Francis","","Sandia National Laboratories (SNL), Albuquerque, NM, and Livermore, CA (United States)","USDOE","","United States","2015-04-22T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: Energy Technology & Policy (Online); Journal Volume: 2; Journal Issue: 1","","Medium: ED; Size: p. 58-72","","","AC04-94AL85000","Journal ID: ISSN 2331-7000","10.1080/23317000.2015.1027069","","2015-09-22T00:00:00Z","1214772","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/1214772","https://www.osti.gov/servlets/purl/1214772","Energy Technology & Policy (Online)","1","2"

These properties improvements are attributed to the better properties of Mg-modulated TiO{sub 2} as compared to TiO{sub 2} such as better optical transmission properties, upshifted conduction band minimum (CBM) and downshifted valence band maximum (VBM), better hole-blocking effect, and higher electron life time. The higher-lying CBM due to the modulation with wider band gap MgO and the formation of magnesium oxide and magnesium hydroxides together resulted in an increment of V{sub oc}. In addition, the Mg-modulated TiO{sub 2} with lower VBM played a better role in the hole-blocking. The HBL with modulated band position provided better electron transport and hole blocking effects within the device.","","","","","","United States","2015-03-23T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: Applied Physics Letters; Journal Volume: 106; Journal Issue: 12; Other Information: (c) 2015 AIP Publishing LLC; Country of input: International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA)","","Medium: X; Size: page(s) 121104-121104.5","","","","Journal ID: ISSN 0003-6951; CODEN: APPLAB; TRN: US15A6054104453","10.1063/1.4916345","","2015-11-09T00:00:00Z","22398756","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/22398756","","Applied Physics Letters","12","106"

The Meyer-Neldel energies for electrons and holes are the slopes of these exponentials. Our results indicate that emission probabilities of neutral states no deeper than approximately 0.45 eV and 0.37 eV from the conduction and valence band edges, respectively, can show a Meyer-Neldel behavior only, while on the other hand, its implementation in deeper gap states makes the replication of experimental J-V curves of p-i-n solar cells and detectors impossible. The Meyer-Neldel behavior can be included in all neutral capture cross sections of acceptor-like tail states without affecting the J-V characteristics, while it cannot be included in all capture cross sections of neutral donor-like tail states and/or defect states without predicting device performances below the experimental figures, that become even lower when it is also included in charged capture cross sections. The implementation of the anti Meyer-Neldel behavior at tail states gives rise to slightly better and reasonable device performances.","","","","","","United States","2015-03-14T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: Journal of Applied Physics; Journal Volume: 117; Journal Issue: 10; Other Information: (c) 2015 AIP Publishing LLC; Country of input: International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA)","","Medium: X; Size: page(s) 104513-104513.11","","","","Journal ID: ISSN 0021-8979; CODEN: JAPIAU; TRN: US15A8533104960","10.1063/1.4914038","","2015-11-09T00:00:00Z","22399263","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/22399263","","Journal of Applied Physics","10","117"

Unfortunately, direct film growth of Bi₂Pt₂O₇ has not yet been achieved, owing to the difficulty of oxidizing platinum metal in the precursor material to Pt⁴⁺. In this work, in order to induce oxidation of the platinum, we annealed pulsed laser deposited films consisting of epitaxial δ–Bi₂O₃ and co-deposited, comparatively disordered platinum. We present synchrotron x-ray diffraction results that show the nonuniform annealed films contain the first epitaxial crystals of Bi₂Pt₂O₇. We also visualized the pyrochlore structure by scanning transmission electron microscopy, and observed ordered cation vacancies in the epitaxial crystals formed in a bismuth-rich film but not in those formed in a platinum-rich film. The similarity between the δ–Bi₂O₃ and Bi₂Pt₂O₇ structures appears to facilitate the pyrochlore formation. These results provide the only route to date for the formation of epitaxial Bi₂Pt₂O₇.","American Institute of Physics (AIP)","","Energy Frontier Research Centers (EFRC) (United States).

A significant finding was the observation of negative temperature coefficient (NTC) behavior.

Solar cells based on silicon p-n junctions and α-Si:H or α-SiC:H-Si heterojunctions (so-called HIT structures) are considered in a unified approach. It is shown that a common feature of these SCs is an increased open-circuit voltage V{sub oc} associated with an additional contribution of the rear surface. Within an approach based on analysis of the physical features of photoconversion in SCs, taking into account the main recombination mechanisms, including Shockley-Read-Hall recombination, radiative recombination, surface recombination, recombination in the space-charge region, and band-to-band Auger recombination, expressions for the photoconversion efficiency of such SCs are obtained. The developed theory is compared with experiments, including those for SCs with record parameters, e.g., η = 25% and 24.7% for SCs with a p-n junction for HIT structures, respectively, under AM1.5 conditions. By comparing theory and experiment, the values of S{sub s} achieved as a result of recombination-loss minimization by various methods are determined.

Comparisons with numerical results calculated by the Silvaco ATLAS device simulator in the same LT cells show that the analytical results are systematically overestimated. According to the authors, the inaccuracies in J{sub sc}, V{sub oc}, and η are due to the fact that assuming ideal collection from space-charge region (SCR) and using the superposition approximation introduce systematic errors into analytical models. In this comment, an analytical approach using reported solutions to the transport equations in QNR and SCR, where ideal collection from SCR is assumed and the superposition approximation is used, is shown to agree with both the Silvaco and PC1d numerical approaches in calculating J{sub sc}, V{sub oc}, and η, in the same LT devices as considered in the commented paper.

"Effect of extended strain fields on point defect phonon scattering in thermoelectric materials","Ortiz, Brenden R.; Peng, Haowei; Lopez, Armando; Parilla, Philip A.; Lany, Stephan; Toberer, Eric S.","30 DIRECT ENERGY CONVERSION; fleet DNA; medium-duty; heavy-duty; drive cycle; data collection; data analysis; vocational database","The design of thermoelectric materials often involves the integration of point defects (alloying) as a route to reduce the lattice thermal conductivity. Classically, the point defect scattering strength follows from simple considerations such as mass contrast and the presence of induced strain fields (e.g. radius contrast, coordination changes). While the mass contrast can be easily calculated, the associated strain fields induced by defect chemistry are not readily predicted and are poorly understood. In this work, we use classical and first principles calculations to provide insight into the strain field component of phonon scattering from isoelectronic point defects. Our results also integrate experimental measurements on bulk samples of SnSe and associated alloys with S, Te, Ge, Sr and Ba. These efforts highlight that the strength and extent of the resulting strain field depends strongly on defect chemistry. Strain fields can have a profound impact on the local structure. For example, in alloys containing Ba, the strain fields have significant spatial extent (1 nm in diameter) and produce large shifts in the atomic equilibrium positions (up to 0.5 A). Such chemical complexity suggests that computational assessment of point defects for thermal conductivity depression should be hindered. However, in this work, we present and verify several computational descriptors that correlate well with the experimentally measured strain fields. Furthermore, these descriptors are conceptually transparent and computationally inexpensive, allowing computation to provide a pivotal role in the screening of effective alloys. The further development of point defect engineering could complement or replace nanostructuring when optimizing the thermal conductivity, offering the benefits of thermodynamic stability, and providing more clearly defined defect chemistry.","Royal Society of Chemistry","","National Renewable Energy Lab.

"DC Microgrids&#x2013;Part I: A Review of Control Strategies and Stabilization Techniques","Dragicevic, Tomislav; Lu, Xiaonan; Vasquez, Juan; Guerrero, Josep","30 DIRECT ENERGY CONVERSION; Coordinated control; DC microgrid (MG); impedance specifications; local control; stability","This paper presents a review of control strategies, stability analysis, and stabilization techniques for dc microgrids (MGs). Overall control is systematically classified into local and coordinated control levels according to respective functionalities in each level. As opposed to local control, which relies only on local measurements, some line of communication between units needs to be made available in order to achieve the coordinated control. Depending on the communication method, three basic coordinated control strategies can be distinguished, i.e., decentralized, centralized, and distributed control. Decentralized control can be regarded as an extension of the local control since it is also based exclusively on local measurements. In contrast, centralized and distributed control strategies rely on digital communication technologies. A number of approaches using these three coordinated control strategies to achieve various control objectives are reviewed in this paper. Moreover, properties of dc MG dynamics and stability are discussed. This paper illustrates that tightly regulated point-of-load converters tend to reduce the stability margins of the system since they introduce negative impedances, which can potentially oscillate with lightly damped power supply input filters. It is also demonstrated that how the stability of the whole system is defined by the relationship of the source and load impedances, referred to as the minor loop gain. Several prominent specifications for the minor loop gain are reviewed. Finally, a number of active stabilization techniques are presented.","IEEE","","Argonne National Lab.

The ability of the “NiOOH” active material to deliver an approximately ideal charge and discharge facilitated a coulometric and thermodynamic analysis through which the charge/discharge mechanisms were determined from known enthalpies of formation. The (dis)charge states were confirmed with <i>in situ</i> Raman spectroscopy. The mechanisms were additionally evaluated with respect to pH and potential dependence, charge quantities, hysteresis, and fluoride ion partial inhibition of the charge mechanism. The results indicate that the “NiOOH” (dis)charges as a solid-state system with mechanisms consistent with known nickel and oxygen redox reactions. A defect chemistry mechanism known for the LiNiO<sub>2</sub> system also occurs for “NiOOH” to cause both high activity and hysteresis.

These materials are of great interest for applications in solar energy conversion, including solar electricity and solar fuels production, due to their unique materials properties, form factors, ease of fabrication, and device processing attributes. The Si MW array geometry allows for efficient collection of photogenerated carriers from impure materials that have short minority-carrier diffusion lengths, while simultaneously allowing for high optical absorption and high external quantum yields for charge carrier collection. In addition, Si MW arrays exhibit unique mesoscale optical behavior and can be removed from the growth substrate to provide flexible, processable arrays of Si microwires ordered in a variety of organic polymers and ionomers. The unique photon management properties of Si MW arrays, combined with their high internal surface area and controlled morphology for catalyst placement and support, allow for the use of earth-abundant electrocatalysts to produce an integrated, functional photoelectrode. Furthermore, these materials therefore also provide an opportunity to explore the 3-dimensional photoelectrochemical behavior of fuel-forming microstructured electrodes.","American Chemical Society","","California Institute of Technology (CalTech), Pasadena, CA (United States)","USDOE Office of Science (SC), Basic Energy Sciences (BES)","","United States","2013-12-09T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: Journal of Physical Chemistry.

A relationship coefficient f was provided whose values are compared to those from a PV array operating in a free standing mode on a terrace. A theoretical model to predict f was elaborated. According to the analysis, the coefficient f takes higher values for PV modules embedded on a roof compared to the free standing PV array. The wind effect is much stronger for the free standing PV than for any BIPV configuration, either the PV is part of the roof, or placed upon the roof, or is placed outside a window like a shadow hanger. The f coefficient depends on various parameters such as angle of inclination, wind speed and direction, as well as solar radiation. For very low wind speeds the effect of the angle of inclination, β, of the PV module with respect to the horizontal on PV temperature is clear. As the wind speed increases, the heat transfer from the PV module shifts from natural flow to forced flow and this effect vanishes. The coefficient f values range from almost 0.01 m{sup 2°}C/W for free standing PV arrays at strong wind speeds, v{sub W}>7m/s, up to around 0.05 m{sup 2°}C/W for the case of flexible PV modules which make part of the roof in a BIPV system.","","","","","","United States","2014-10-06T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","Conference","Journal Name: AIP Conference Proceedings; Journal Volume: 1618; Journal Issue: 1; Conference: ICCMSE 2014: International conference on computational methods in science and engineering 2014, Athens (Greece), 4-7 Apr 2014; Other Information: (c) 2014 AIP Publishing LLC; Country of input: International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA)","","Medium: X; Size: page(s) 341-347","","","","Journal ID: ISSN 0094-243X; CODEN: APCPCS; TRN: US14B0166014106","10.1063/1.4897744","","2015-02-27T00:00:00Z","22307933","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/22307933","","AIP Conference Proceedings","1","1618"

A set of control systems are required in order to operate a fuel cell based power plant system optimally. For the purpose of control system design, an accurate fuel cell stack model in describing the dynamics of the real system is needed. Currently, linear model are widely used for fuel cell stack control purposes, but it has limitations in narrow operation range. While nonlinear models lead to nonlinear control implemnetation whos more complex and hard computing. In this research, nonlinear cancellation technique will be used to transform a nonlinear model into a linear form while maintaining the nonlinear characteristics. The transformation is done by replacing the input of the original model by a certain virtual input that has nonlinear relationship with the original input. Then the equality of the two models is tested by running a series of simulation. Input variation of H2, O2 and H2O as well as disturbance input I (current load) are studied by simulation. The error of comparison between the proposed model and the original nonlinear model are less than 1 %. Thus we can conclude that nonlinear cancellation technique can be used to represent fuel cell nonlinear model in a simple linear form while maintaining the nonlinear characteristics and therefore retain the wide operation range.","","","","","","United States","2014-09-25T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","Conference","Journal Name: AIP Conference Proceedings; Journal Volume: 1617; Journal Issue: 1; Conference: ICTAP 2013: 3. international conference on theoretical and applied physics, Malang, East Java (Indonesia), 10-11 Oct 2013; Other Information: (c) 2014 AIP Publishing LLC; Country of input: International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA)","","Medium: X; Size: page(s) 71-74","","","","Journal ID: ISSN 0094-243X; CODEN: APCPCS; TRN: US14B0144014085","10.1063/1.4897107","","2015-02-27T00:00:00Z","22307912","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/22307912","","AIP Conference Proceedings","1","1617"

Replacing PCBM with bis-adduct fullerenes significantly improves V<sub>oc</sub> and the PCE in devices based on the conjugated polymer poly(3-hexyl thiophene) (P3HT). However, for the most promising low band-gap polymer (LBP) system, replacing PCBM with ICBA results in poor short-circuit current (J<sub>sc</sub>) and PCE although V<sub>oc</sub> is significantly improved. The optimization of the morphology of as-cast LBP/bis-fullerene BHJ photovoltaics is attempted by adding a co-solvent to the polymer/fullerene solution prior to film deposition. Varying the solubility of polymer and fullerene in the co-solvent, bulk heterojunctions are fabricated with no change of polymer ordering, but with changes in fullerene phase separation. The morphologies of the as-cast samples are characterized by small angle neutron scattering and neutron reflectometry. A homogenous dispersion of ICBA in LBP is found in the samples where the co-solvent is selective to the polymer, giving poor device performance. Aggregates of ICBA are formed in samples where the co-solvent is selective to ICBA. Furthermore, the resultant morphology improves PCE by up to 246%. Finally, a quantitative analysis of the neutron data shows that the interfacial area between ICBA aggregates and its surrounding matrix is improved, facilitating charge transport and improving the PCE.","Wiley","","Oak Ridge National Lab.

We studied the thermoelectric properties of nanostructured SnTe with different dopants, and found indium-doped SnTe showed extraordinarily large Seebeck coefficients that cannot be explained properly by the conventional two-valence band model. We attributed this enhancement of Seebeck coefficients to resonant levels created by the indium impurities inside the valence band, supported by the first-principles simulations. This, together with the lower thermal conductivity resulting from the decreased grain size by ball milling and hot pressing, improved both the peak and average nondimensional figure-of-merit (ZT) significantly.

"Hydroxide Degradation Pathways for Imidazolium Cations. A DFT Study","Long, H.; Pivovar, B.","30 DIRECT ENERGY CONVERSION; 37 INORGANIC, ORGANIC, PHYSICAL AND ANALYTICAL CHEMISTRY; Computational Sciences; Chemical and Material Sciences","Imidazolium cations are promising candidates as covalently tetherable cations for application in anion exchange membranes. They have generated specific interest in alkaline membrane fuel cell applications where ammonium-based cations have been the most commonly applied but have been found to be susceptible to hydroxide attack. In the search for high stability cations, a detailed understanding of the degradation pathways and reaction barriers is required. In this work, we investigate imidazolium and benzimidazolium cations in the presence of hydroxide using density functional theory calculations for their potential in alkaline membrane fuel cells. Moreover, the dominant degradation pathway for these cations is predicted to be the nucleophilic addition–elimination pathway at the C-2 atom position on the imidazolium ring. Steric interferences, introduced by substitutions at the C-2, C-4, and C-5 atom positions, were investigated and found to have a significant, positive impact on calculated degradation energy barriers. Benzimidazolium cations, with their larger conjugated systems, are predicted to degrade much faster than their imidazolium counterparts. Our results provide important insight into designing stable cations for anion exchange membranes. Some of the molecules studied have significantly increased degradation energy barriers suggesting that they could possess significantly improved (several orders of magnitude) durability compared to traditional cations and potentially enable new applications.","American Chemical Society","","National Renewable Energy Lab.

Detail shape and size of nanoparticles are directly related with the localized surface plasmon effect as well as optical properties; however, their detail shape and size are hard to be determined depending only on the theoretical or experimental approach. Therefore, the method focusing on defining structural boundaries would be a useful method for nano or microscale design to generate simple and clear shape. In this study, we adopted the structural optimization scheme based on the phase field method to determine the optimal shape of a silver (Ag) nanoparticle positioned on the upper surface of the absorbing layer. We carried out the design process for broadband wavelength to be taken into account and verified the plasmonic scattering effect enhancement in the absorbing layer by numerical simulations.","","","","","","United States","2014-05-14T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: Journal of Applied Physics; Journal Volume: 115; Journal Issue: 18; Other Information: (c) 2014 AIP Publishing LLC; Country of input: International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA)","","Medium: X; Size: page(s) 184302-184302.6","","","","Journal ID: ISSN 0021-8979; CODEN: JAPIAU; TRN: US14A2340096926","10.1063/1.4875660","","2014-11-03T00:00:00Z","22275571","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/22275571","","Journal of Applied Physics","18","115"

We study the effect of the period, the bottom diameter, the top diameter, and the height of the MPs or NCs on the efficiency, assuming that one absorbed photon induces one exciton. This allows us to give a kind of abacus involving all the geometrical parameters of the nanostructured surface with regard to the efficiency of the associated solar cell. We also show that for a given ratio of the diameter over the period, the best efficiency is obtained for small diameters. For small lengths, MPs are extended to NCs by changing the angle between the bottom surface and the vertical face of the MPs. The best efficiency is obtained for an angle of the order of 70°.

Ignition delay times for H<sub>2</sub>/CO/O<sub>2</sub>/N<sub>2</sub>/Ar mixtures have been measured using two rapid compression machines and shock tubes at pressures from 1 to 70 bar, over a temperature range of 914–2220 K and at equivalence ratios from 0.1 to 4.0. Results show a strong dependence of ignition times on temperature and pressure at the end of the compression; ignition delays decrease with increasing temperature, pressure, and equivalence ratio. The reactivity of the syngas mixtures was found to be governed by hydrogen chemistry for CO concentrations lower than 50% in the fuel mixture. For higher CO concentrations, an inhibiting effect of CO was observed. Flame speeds were measured in helium for syngas mixtures with a high CO content and at elevated pressures of 5 and 10 atm using the spherically expanding flame method. A detailed chemical kinetic mechanism for hydrogen and H<sub>2</sub>/CO (syngas) mixtures has been updated, rate constants have been adjusted to reflect new experimental information obtained at high pressures and new rate constant values recently published in the literature. Experimental results for ignition delay times and flame speeds have been compared with predictions using our newly revised chemical kinetic mechanism, and good agreement was observed. In the mechanism validation, particular emphasis is placed on predicting experimental data at high pressures (up to 70 bar) and intermediate- to high-temperature conditions, particularly important for applications in internal combustion engines and gas turbines. The reaction sequence H<sub>2</sub> + HO˙<sub>2</sub> ↔ H˙+H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> followed by H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub>(+M) ↔ O˙H+O˙H(+M) was found to play a key role in hydrogen ignition under high-pressure and intermediate-temperature conditions. The rate constant for H<sub>2</sub>+HO˙<sub>2</sub> showed strong sensitivity to high-pressure ignition times and has considerable uncertainty, based on literature values. As a result, a rate constant for this reaction is recommended based on available literature values and on our mechanism validation.","Elsevier","","Lawrence Livermore National Lab.

"Solving security constrained optimal power flow problems by a structure exploiting interior point method","Chiang, Naiyuan; Grothey, Andreas","30 DIRECT ENERGY CONVERSION; Interior point methods; Preconditioner; SCOPF; Structure exploitation iterative methods","In this paper we present a new approach to solve the DC (n - 1) security constrained optimal power flow (SCOPF) problem by a structure exploiting interior point solver. Our approach is based on a reformulation of the linearised SCOPF model, in which most matrices that need to be factorized are constant. Hence, most factorizations and a large number of back-solve operations only need to be performed once. However, assembling the Schur complement matrix remains expensive in this scheme. To reduce the effort, we suggest using a preconditioned iterative method to solve the corresponding linear system. We suggest two main schemes to pick a good and robust preconditioner based on combining different “active” contingency scenarios of the SCOPF model. These new schemes are implemented within the object-oriented parallel solver (OOPS), a structure-exploiting primal-dual interior-point implementation. We give results on several SCOPF test problems. The largest example contains 500 buses. We compare the results from the original interior point method (IPM) implementation in OOPS and our new reformulation.","Springer","","Argonne National Lab.

"An experimental and modeling study investigating the ignition delay in a military diesel engine running hexadecane (cetane) fuel","Cowart, Jim S.; Fischer, Warren P.; Hamilton, Leonard J.; Caton, Patrick A.; Sarathy, S. Mani; Pitz, William J.","30 DIRECT ENERGY CONVERSION; diesel; engine; fuel; ignition delay; hexadecane; cetane; combustion kinetics","In an effort aimed at predicting the combustion behavior of a new fuel in a conventional diesel engine, cetane (n-hexadecane) fuel was used in a military engine across the entire speed–load operating range. The ignition delay was characterized for this fuel at each operating condition. A chemical ignition delay was also predicted across the speed–load range using a detailed chemical kinetic mechanism with a constant pressure reactor model. At each operating condition, the measured in-cylinder pressure and predicted temperature at the start of injection were applied to the detailed n-hexadecane kinetic mechanism, and the chemical ignition delay was predicted without any kinetic mechanism calibration. The modeling results show that fuel–air parcels developed from the diesel spray with an equivalence ratio of 4 are the first to ignite. The chemical ignition delay results also showed decreasing igntion delays with increasing engine load and speed, just as the experimental data revealed. At lower engine speeds and loads, the kinetic modeling results show the characteristic two-stage negative temperature coefficient behavior of hydrocarbon fuels. However, at high engine speeds and loads, the reactions do not display negative temperature coefficient behavior, as the reactions proceed directly into high-temperature pathways due to higher temperatures and pressure at injection. A moderate difference between the total and chemical ignition delays was then characterized as a phyical delay period that scales inversely with engine speed. This physical delay time is representative of the diesel spray development time and is seen to become a minority fraction of the total igntion delay at higher engine speeds. In addition, the approach used in this study suggests that the ignition delay and thus start of combustion may be predicted with reasonable accuracy using kinetic modeling to determine the chemical igntion delay. Then, in conjunction with the physical delay time (experimental or modeling based), a new fuel’s acceptability in a conventional engine could be assessed by determining that the total ignition delay is not too short or too long.","SAGE","","Lawrence Livermore National Lab., Livermore, CA (United States)","USDOE","","United States","2013-02-01T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: International Journal of Engine Research; Journal Volume: 14; Journal Issue: 1","","Medium: ED; Size: 39 p.","","LLNL-JRNL-590393","AC52-07NA27344","Journal ID: ISSN 1468-0874","10.1177/1468087412446884","","2021-05-03T00:00:00Z","1281692","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/1281692","https://www.osti.gov/servlets/purl/1281692","International Journal of Engine Research","1","14"

Shock tube and rapid compression machine ignition delay time measurements are reported over a wide range of conditions of relevance to combustion engine applications: temperatures from 678 to 1356 K; pressures of 6.5, 10, 20, and 50 atm; and equivalence ratios of 0.5, 1.0, and 2.0. The wide range of temperatures examined provides observation of autoignition in three reactivity regimes, including the negative temperature coefficient (NTC) regime characteristic of paraffinic fuels. Comparisons made between the current ignition delay measurements for 3-methylheptane and previous results for n-octane and 2-methylheptane quantifies the influence of a single methyl substitution and its location on the reactivity of alkanes. It is found that the three C8 alkane isomers have indistinguishable high-temperature ignition delay but their ignition delay times deviate in the NTC and low-temperature regimes in correlation with their research octane numbers. The experimental results are compared with the predictions of a proposed kinetic model that includes both high- and low-temperature oxidation chemistry. The model mechanistically explains the differences in reactivity for n-octane, 2-methylheptane, and 3-methylheptane in the NTC through the influence of the methyl substitution on the rates of isomerization reactions in the low-temperature chain branching pathway, that ultimately leads to ketohydroperoxide species, and the competition between low-temperature chain branching and the formation of cyclic ethers, in a chain propagating pathway.","Elsevier","","Lawrence Livermore National Lab.

"Detailed kinetic modeling study of <i>n</i>-pentanol oxidation","Heufer, K. Alexander; Sarathy, S. Mani; Curran, Henry J.; Davis, Alexander C.; Westbrook, Charles K.; Pitz, William J.","30 DIRECT ENERGY CONVERSION","To help overcome the world’s dependence upon fossil fuels, suitable biofuels are promising alternatives that can be used in the transportation sector. Recent research on internal combustion engines shows that short alcoholic fuels (e.g., ethanol or <i>n</i>-butanol) have reduced pollutant emissions and increased knock resistance compared to fossil fuels. Although higher molecular weight alcohols (e.g., <i>n</i>-pentanol and <i>n</i>-hexanol) exhibit higher reactivity that lowers their knock resistance, they are suitable for diesel engines or advanced engine concepts, such as homogeneous charge compression ignition (HCCI), where higher reactivity at lower temperatures is necessary for engine operation. The present study presents a detailed kinetic model for <i>n</i>-pentanol based on modeling rules previously presented for <i>n</i>-butanol. This approach was initially validated using quantum chemistry calculations to verify the most stable <i>n</i>-pentanol conformation and to obtain C–H and C–C bond dissociation energies. In addition, the proposed model has been validated against ignition delay time data, speciation data from a jet-stirred reactor, and laminar flame velocity measurements. Overall, the model shows good agreement with the experiments and permits a detailed discussion of the differences between alcohols and alkanes.","American Chemical Society (ACS)","","Lawrence Livermore National Lab., Livermore, CA (United States)","USDOE","","United States","2012-09-28T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: Energy and Fuels; Journal Volume: 26; Journal Issue: 11","","Medium: ED; Size: p. 6678-6685","","LLNL-JRNL-590392","AC52-07NA27344","Journal ID: ISSN 0887-0624","10.1021/ef3012596","","2021-07-20T00:00:00Z","1281693","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/1281693","https://www.osti.gov/servlets/purl/1281693","Energy and Fuels","11","26"

These latest extensive research efforts are spurred by a renewed interest in high temperature thermal-to-electrical energy conversion schemes including thermophotovoltaics (TPV), solar–thermophotovoltaics, solar–thermal, and solar–thermochemical energy conversion systems. This field is profiting tremendously from the outstanding degree of control over the thermal emission properties that can be achieved with nanoscale photonic materials. The key to obtaining high efficiency in this class of high temperature energy conversion is the spectral and angular matching of the radiation properties of an emitter to those of an absorber. Together with the achievements in the field of high-performance narrow bandgap photovoltaic cells, the ability to tailor the radiation properties of thermal emitters and absorbers using nanophotonics facilitates a route to achieving the impressive efficiencies predicted by theoretical studies. In this review, we will discuss the possibilities of emission tailoring by nanophotonics in the light of high temperature thermal-to-electrical energy conversion applications, and give a brief introduction to the field of TPV. We will demonstrate how a class of large area 2D metallic photonic crystals can be designed and employed to efficiently control and tailor the spectral and angular emission properties, paving the way towards new and highly efficient thermophotovoltaic systems and enabling other energy conversion schemes based on high-performance high-temperature nanoscale photonic materials.","Royal Society of Chemistry","","Massachusetts Inst. of Technology (MIT), Cambridge, MA (United States)","USDOE Office of Science (SC), Basic Energy Sciences (BES); National Science Foundation (NSF)","","United States","2012-08-24T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: Energy & Environmental Science; Journal Volume: 5; Journal Issue: 10; Related Information: S3TEC partners with Massachusetts Institute of Technology (lead); Boston College; Oak Ridge National Laboratory; Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute","","Medium: ED; Size: Article No. 8815","","","SC0001299; FG02-09ER46577; ECS-0335765","Journal ID: ISSN 1754-5692; EESNBY","10.1039/c2ee22731b","","2022-05-23T00:00:00Z","1386823","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/1386823","https://www.osti.gov/servlets/purl/1386823","Energy & Environmental Science","10","5"

"Oxygen Transport Kinetics in Infiltrated SOFCs Cathode by Electrical Conductivity Relaxation Technique","Li, Yihong; Gerdes, Kirk; Liu, Xingbo","30 DIRECT ENERGY CONVERSION","Infiltration has attracted increasing attention as an effective technique to modify SOFC cathodes to improve cell electrochemical performance while maintaining material compatibility and long-term stability. However, the infiltrated material's effect on oxygen transport is still not clear and detailed knowledge of the oxygen reduction reaction in infiltrated cathodes is lacking. In this work, the technique of electrical conductivity relaxation (ECR) is used to evaluate oxygen exchange in two common infiltrated materials, Ce{sub 0.8}Sm{sub 0.2}O{sub 1.9} and La{sub 0.6}Sr{sub 0.4}CoO{sub 3-δ}. The ECR technique is also used to examine the transport processes in a composite material formed with a backbone of La{sub 0.6}Sr{sub 0.4}Co{sub 0.2}Fe{sub 0.8}O{sub 3-δ} and possessing a thin, dense surface layer composed of the representative infiltrate material. Both the surface oxygen exchange process and the oxygen exchange coefficient at infiltrate/LSCF interface are reported. ECR testing results indicate that the application of infiltrate under certain oxygen partial pressure conditions produces a measureable increase in the fitted oxygen exchange parameter. It is presently only possible to generate hypotheses to explain the observation. However the correlation between improved electrochemical performance and increased oxygen transport measured by ECR is reliably demonstrated. The simple and inexpensive ECR technique is utilized as a direct method to optimize the selection of specific infiltrate/backbone material systems for superior performance.","","","National Energy Technology Lab.

Understanding the water saturation distribution is critical for both remediation and contaminant flux monitoring in unsaturated environments. In this work we propose and demonstrate a method of remotely determining water saturation levels using gas phase partitioning tracers and time-lapse bulk electrical conductivity measurements. The theoretical development includes the partitioning chemistry for the tracers we demonstrate (ammonia and carbon dioxide), as well as a review of the petrophysical relationship governing how these tracers influence bulk conductivity. We also investigate methods of utilizing secondary information provided by electrical conductivity breakthrough magnitudes induced by the tracers. We test the method on clean, well characterized, intermediate-scale sand columns under controlled conditions. Results demonstrate the capability to predict partitioning coefficients and accurately monitor gas breakthrough curves along the length of the column according to the corresponding electrical conductivity response, leading to accurate water saturation estimates. This work is motivated by the need to develop effective characterization and monitoring techniques for contaminated deep vadose zone environments, and provides a proof-of-concept toward uniquely characterizing and monitoring water saturation levels at the field scale and in three-dimensions using electrical resistivity tomography.","Soil Science Society of America","","Pacific Northwest National Lab.

Low fidelities of maturation result in preparations containing a significant fraction of inactive, apo-protein that are not suitable for biophysical or crystallographic studies. We describe the construction, overexpression and high-yield purification of a fusion protein consisting of the algal [2Fe2S]-ferredoxin PetF (Fd) and [FeFe]-hydrogenase HydA1. The maturation of Fd-HydA1 was optimized through improvements in culture conditions and media components used for expression. We also demonstrated that fusion of Fd to the N-terminus of HydA1, in comparison to the C-terminus, led to increased expression levels that were 4-fold higher. Together, these improvements led to enhanced HydA1 activity and improved yield after purification. The strong binding-affinity of Fd for DEAE allowed for two-step purification by ion exchange and StrepTactin affinity chromatography. In addition, the incorporation of a TEV protease site in the Fd-HydA1 linker allowed for the proteolytic removal of Fd after DEAE step, and purification of HydA1 alone by StrepTactin. In combination, this process resulted in HydA1 purification yields of 5 mg L{sup -1} of culture from E. coli with specific activities of 1000 U (U = 1 {micro}mol hydrogen evolved mg{sup -1} min{sup -1}). The [FeFe]-hydrogenases are highly efficient enzymes and their catalytic sites provide model structures for synthetic efforts to develop robust hydrogen activation catalysts.

"Overcoming the black body limit in plasmonic and graphene near-field thermophotovoltaic systems","Ilic, Ognjen; Jablan, Marinko; Joannopoulos, John D.; Celanovic, Ivan; Soljačić, Marin","30 DIRECT ENERGY CONVERSION","Near-field thermophotovoltaic (TPV) systems with carefully tailored emitter-PV properties show large promise for a new temperature range (600 – 1200K) solid state energy conversion, where conventional thermoelectric (TE) devices cannot operate due to high temperatures and far-field TPV schemes suffer from low efficiency and power density. We present a detailed theoretical study of several different implementations of thermal emitters using plasmonic materials and graphene. We find that optimal improvements over the black body limit are achieved for low bandgap semiconductors and properly matched plasmonic frequencies. For a pure plasmonic emitter, theoretically predicted generated power density of 14 $\frac{W}{cm^2}$ efficiency of 36% can be achieved at 600K (hot-side), for 0.17eV bandgap (InSb). Developing insightful approximations, we argue that large plasmonic losses can, contrary to intuition, be helpful in enhancing the overall near-field transfer. We discuss and quantify the properties of an optimal near-field photovoltaic (PV) diode. In addition, we study plasmons in graphene and show that doping can be used to tune the plasmonic dispersion relation to match the PV cell bangap. In case of graphene, theoretically predicted generated power density of 6(120)$\frac{W}{cm^2}$ efficiency of 35(40)% can be achieved at 600(1200)K, for 0.17eV bandgap.

The Ni poisoning effects reported in literature were confirmed and degradation was examined by electrochemical methods and post-test microstructural and chemical analyses. The results indicate that P-induced degradation rates and mechanisms are fuel dependent and that degradation of cells operated in synthesis gas (syngas) with phosphine is more severe than that of cells operated in hydrogen with phosphine. As reported in published literature, a cell operated in syngas containing 10 ppm phosphine demonstrated significant microstructural degradation within the Ni phase, including formation of Ni–P phases concentrated on the outer layer of the anode and significant pitting corrosion in the Ni grains. In this research, a previously undetected YPO{sub 4} phase is observed at the YSZ/YSZ/Ni triple grain junctions located at the interface with the YSZ electrolyte. Tetragonal YSZ (t-YSZ) and cubic-YSZ (c-YSZ) domains with sizes of several tens of nanometers are also newly observed along the Ni/YSZ interface. These observations contrast with data obtained for a cell operated in dry hydrogen with phosphine, where no YPO{sub 4} phase is observed and the alternating t-YSZ and c-YSZ domains at the Ni/YSZ interface are smaller with typical sizes of 5–10 nm. The data imply that electrolyte attack by P is a potentially debilitating mode of degradation in SOFC anodes, and that the associated reaction mechanisms and rates are worthy of further examination.","","","National Energy Technology Lab.

We have developed a combined approach of quantum chemistry, statistical physics, and all-atomistic molecular dynamics simulation to determine the partial atomic charges of the ground-state triad. To fully explore the free energy landscape of triad, the replica exchange method was applied to enhance the sampling efficiency of the simulations. The confinement effects on the triad were modeled by imposing three sizes of spherocylindrical nanocapsules. The triad is structurally flexible under ambient conditions, and its conformation distribution is manipulated by the choice of water models and confinement. Two types of water models (SPC/E and TIP3P) are used for solvation. When solvated by SPC/E water, whose HOH angle follows an ideal tetrahedron, the structural characteristics of triad is compact in the bulk systems. However, under a certain nanosized confinement that drastically disrupts hydrogen bond networks in solvent, the triad favors an extended configuration. By contrast, the triad solvated by TIP3P water shows a set of U-shaped conformations in the confinement. We have shown that a slight structural difference in the two water models with the same dipole moment can have great distinction in water density, water orientation, and the number of hydrogen bonds in the proximity of a large flexible compound such as the triad. Subsequently, it has direct impact on the position of the triad in a confinement as well as the distribution of conformations at the interface of liquid and solid in a finite-size system.","American Chemical Society","","Univ. of Houston, TX (United States)","USDOE Office of Science (SC), Basic Energy Sciences (BES)","","United States","2012-02-22T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: Journal of Physical Chemistry.

"Avoiding compressor surge during emergency shutdown hybridturbine systems","Pezzini, Paolo; Tucker, David; Traverso, Alberto","20 FOSSIL-FUELED POWER PLANTS; 30 DIRECT ENERGY CONVERSION","A new emergency shutdown procedure for a direct-fired fuel cell turbine hybrid power system was evaluated using a hardware-based simulation of an integrated gasifier/fuel cell/turbine hybrid cycle (IGFC), implemented through the Hybrid Performance (Hyper) project at the National Energy Technology Laboratory, U.S. Department of Energy (NETL). The Hyper facility is designed to explore dynamic operation of hybrid systems and quantitatively characterize such transient behavior. It is possible to model, test, and evaluate the effects of different parameters on the design and operation of a gasifier/fuel cell/gas turbine hybrid system and provide a means of quantifying risk mitigation strategies. An open-loop system analysis regarding the dynamic effect of bleed air, cold air bypass, and load bank is presented in order to evaluate the combination of these three main actuators during emergency shutdown. In the previous Hybrid control system architecture, catastrophic compressor failures were observed when the fuel and load bank were cut off during emergency shutdown strategy. Improvements were achieved using a nonlinear fuel valve ramp down when the load bank was not operating. Experiments in load bank operation show compressor surge and stall after emergency shutdown activation. The difficulties in finding an optimal compressor and cathode mass flow for mitigation of surge and stall using these actuators are illustrated.","","","National Energy Technology Lab.

"Improved Durability of SOEC Stacks for High Temperature Electrolysis","O'Brien, James E.; O'Brien, Robert C.; Zhang, Xiaoyu; Hartvigsen, Joseph J.; Tao, Greg","08 HYDROGEN; 30 DIRECT ENERGY CONVERSION; 10 SYNTHETIC FUELS; high temperature electrolysis; hydrogen production; solid oxide electrolysis cells","High temperature steam electrolysis is a promising technology for efficient and sustainable large-scale hydrogen production. Solid oxide electrolysis cells (SOECs) are able to utilize high temperature heat and electric power from advanced high-temperature nuclear reactors or renewable sources to generate carbon-free hydrogen at large scale. However, long term durability of SOECs needs to be improved significantly before commercialization of this technology can be realized. A degradation rate of 1%/khr or lower is proposed as a threshold value for commercialization of this technology. Solid oxide electrolysis stack tests have been conducted at Idaho National Laboratory to demonstrate recent improvements in long-term durability of SOECs. Electrolyte-supported and electrode-supported SOEC stacks were provided by Ceramatec Inc. and Materials and Systems Research Inc. (MSRI), respectively, for these tests. Long-term durability tests were generally operated for a duration of 1000 hours or more. Stack tests based on technologies developed at Ceramatec and MSRI have shown significant improvement in durability in the electrolysis mode. Long-term degradation rates of 3.2%/khr and 4.6%/khr were observed for MSRI and Ceramatec stacks, espectively. One recent Ceramatec stack even showed negative degradation (performance improvement) over 1900 hours of operation. Optimization of electrode materials, interconnect coatings, and electrolyte-electrode interface microstructures contribute to better durability of SOEC stacks.","","","Idaho National Lab.

For the first time, a general set of boundary conditions was derived in order to account for the Stern layer without simulating it in the computational domain. These boundary conditions were valid for planar, cylindrical, and spherical electrode particles or pores. They made possible the simulations of EDLCs with complex geometries while rigorously accounting for both the Stern and diffuse layers. The model also simultaneously accounted not only for 3D electrode morphology but also for finite ion size and field-dependent electrolyte dielectric permittivity. It was used to faithfully simulate the complex structure of an EDLC electrode consisting of ordered bimodal mesoporous carbon featuring both macropores and mesopores. Areal and gravimetric capacitances were predicted based on non-solvated and solvated ion diameters. These two cases set the upper and lower bounds for the predicted capacitances. The capacitances predicted using non-solvated ion diameter were found to be in good agreement with experimental data reported in the literature. All surfaces contributed to the overall capacitance of EDLCs. The gravimetric capacitance of different bimodal carbons increased linearly with increasing specific surface area corresponding to constant areal capacitance.","Elsevier","","Energy Frontier Research Centers (EFRC) (United States).

"Analysis of SOFCs Using Reference Electrodes","Finklea, H.; Chen, X.; Gerdes, K.; Pakalapati, S.; Celik, I.","30 DIRECT ENERGY CONVERSION; solid oxide fuel cells, reference electrodes, impedance analysis, anode-supported, electrolyte-supported, deconvolution","Reference electrodes are frequently applied to isolate the performance of one electrode in a solid oxide fuel cell. However, reference electrode simulations raise doubt to veracity of data collected using reference electrodes. The simulations predict that the reported performance for the one electrode will frequently contain performance of both electrodes. Nonetheless, recent reports persistently treat data so collected as ideally isolated. This work confirms the predictions of the reference electrode simulations on two SOFC designs, and to provides a method of validating the data measured in the 3-electrode configuration. Validation is based on the assumption that a change in gas composition to one electrode does not affect the impedance of the other electrode at open circuit voltage. This assumption is supported by a full physics simulation of the SOFC. Three configurations of reference electrode and cell design are experimentally examined using various gas flows and two temperatures. Impedance data are subjected to deconvolution analysis and equivalent circuit fitting and approximate polarization resistances of the cathode and anode are determined. The results demonstrate that the utility of reference electrodes is limited and often wholly inappropriate. Reported impedances and single electrode polarization values must be scrutinized on this basis.","The Electrochemical Society","","National Energy Technology Lab.

The flames are stabilized on a flat-flame (McKenna type) burner at equivalence ratios of φ = 1.0, 1.75, and 1.9 and at low pressures between 15 Torr (= 20 mbar) and 30 Torr (= 40 mbar). The complex chemistry of MCH consumption is illustrated in the experimental identification of several C<sub>7</sub>H<sub>12</sub>, C<sub>7</sub>H<sub>10</sub>, C<sub>6</sub>H<sub>12</sub>, and C<sub>6</sub>H<sub>10</sub> isomers sampled from the flames as a function of distance from the burner. Three initiation steps for MCH consumption are discussed: ring-opening to heptenes and methyl-hexenes (isomerization), methyl radical loss yielding the cyclohexyl radical (dissociation), and H abstraction from MCH. Mole fraction profiles as a function of distance from the burner for the C<sub>7</sub> species supplemented by theoretical calculations are presented, indicating that flame structures resulting in steeper temperature gradients and/or greater peak temperatures can lead to a relative increase in MCH consumption through the dissociation and isomerization channels. Trends observed among the stable C<sub>6</sub> species as well as 1,3-pentadiene and isoprene also support this conclusion. Relatively large amounts of toluene and benzene are observed in the experiments, illustrating the importance of sequential H-abstraction steps from MCH to toluene and from cyclohexyl to benzene. Furthermore, modeled results using the detailed chemical model of Pitz et al. (Proc. Combust. Inst.2007, 31, 267–275) are also provided to illustrate the use of these data as a benchmark for the improvement or future development of a MCH mechanism.","American Chemical Society (ACS)","","Lawrence Livermore National Lab., Livermore, CA (United States)","USDOE","","United States","2011-11-14T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: Energy and Fuels; Journal Volume: 25; Journal Issue: 12","","Medium: ED; Size: p. 5611–5625","","LLNL-JRNL-519712","AC52-07NA27344","Journal ID: ISSN 0887-0624","10.1021/ef201507x","","2021-07-20T00:00:00Z","1281677","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/1281677","https://www.osti.gov/servlets/purl/1281677","Energy and Fuels","12","25"

The surfaces of the PdTH core are composed of (111) facets wherein the Pd atoms are highly coordinated and have low surface energy. Our results revealed that in comparison with sphere Pd (PdSP)-supported PtML or pure Pt, the PdTH-supported PtML features more surface contraction and a downshift of d-band relative to the Fermi level. These geometric- and electronic-effects determine the higher activity of PtML/PdTH/C for the oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) compared to that of PtML/PdSP/C.

In order to accommodate the design and to evaluate the effectiveness of such engineering seals under various thermo-mechanical operating conditions, computational modeling framework needs to be developed to accurately capture and predict the healing behavior of the glass material. In the present work, a mechanistic-based two-stage model was developed to study the stress and temperature-dependent crack healing of the self-healing glass materials. The model was first calibrated by experimental measurements combined with the kinetic Monte Carlo (kMC) simulation results and then implemented into the finite element analysis (FEA).

We studied a range of hydration levels ({lambda}) at temperatures of 300 and 360 K, and compare the results to our previous findings in the benchmark Nafion membrane at 300 K. The water channel diameter is about 20% larger in Nafion, while the extent of SO3- clustering is more in SSC membrane. The calculated channel diameter is in excellent agreement with the recently proposed cylindrical water channel model of these membranes. The H{sub 2}O network percolation occurs at comparable hydration levels, and the diffusion coefficients of H{sub 2}O and H{sub 3}O{sup +} are similar in SSC and Nafion membranes. Raising the temperature of the SSC membrane from 300 to 360 K provides a much bigger increase in proton vehicular diffusion coefficient (by a factor of about 4) than changing the side chain length. H3O+ ions are found to exchange more frequently with SO{sub 3}{sup -} partners at the higher temperature. Our key findings are that (a) the hydrophobic-hydrophilic separation in the two membranes is surprisingly similar; (b) at all hydration levels studied, the longer side chain of Nafion is bent and is effectively equivalent to a short side chain in terms of extension into the water domain; and (c) proton transport along the centre of the channel is improbable and vehicular proton transport occurs between SO{sub 3}{sup -} groups.

At comparable hydration levels, the pore diameter is smaller, the sulfonate groups are more closely packed, the hydronium ions are more strongly bound to sulfonate groups, and the diffusion of water and hydronium is slower in Ph-SPEEKK relative to the corresponding properties in Nafion. The aromatic carbon backbone of Ph-SPEEKK is less hydrophobic than the fluorocarbon backbone of Nafion. Water network percolation occurs at a hydration level ({lambda}) of {approx}8 H{sub 2}O/SO{sub 3}{sup -}. At {lambda} = 20, water, methanol and hydronium diffusion coefficients were 1.4 x 10{sup -5}, 0.6 x 10{sup -5} and 0.2 x 10{sup -5} cm{sup 2}/s, respectively. The pore network in Ph-SPEEKK evolves dynamically and develops wide pores for {lambda} &gt; 20, which leads to a jump in methanol crossover and ion transport. This study demonstrates the potential of aromatic membranes as low-cost challengers to Nafion for direct methanol fuel cell applications and the need to develop innovative strategies to combat methanol crossover at high hydration levels.","","","Pacific Northwest National Lab.

Understanding the different degradation mechanisms in SOFCs and other electrochemical devices is essential to reducing performance degradation and increasing the lifetime of these devices. In this paper SOFC degradation mechanisms are discussed and a damage model is presented which describes performance degradation in SOFCs due to damage or degradation in the electrodes of the SOFC. A degradation classification scheme is presented that divides the various SOFC electrode degradation mechanisms into categories based on their physical effects on the SOFC. The application of the damage model and the classification method is applied to sulfur poisoning and antimony poisoning which occur in the anode of SOFCs. For sulfur poisoning the model is able to predict the degradation in SOFC performance based on the operating temperature and voltage of the fuel cell and the concentration of gaseous sulfur species in the anode. For antimony poisoning the effects of nickel removal from the anode matrix is investigated.","","","Pacific Northwest National Lab.

Fuel cells with such bi-layer electrolytes were fabricated and tested, yielding open circuit voltages from 0.94 to 1.0 V at 600-700 degrees C. Power densities from 0.4 to 1.0 W cm{sup -2} at 0.7 V were achieved in air at temperatures of 600-700 degrees C. Cell performance was improved in flowing oxygen, with an estimated peak power density of over 2 W cm{sup -2} at 650 degrees C, assuming the same overall resistance over the entire range of current density. The high cell performance was attributed to the very low ohmic resistance of the fuel cell, owing to the small thickness of the electrolyte. Stable performance was also demonstrated in that the voltage of the fuel cell showed very little change at a constant current density of 1 A cm{sup -2} during more than 400 hours of operation at 650 degrees C in flowing oxygen.

The cathode-loop hardware facility, previously connected to the real-time fuel cell model, was integrated with a real-time model of a gasifier of solid (biomass and fossil) fuel. The fuel cells are operated at the compressor delivery pressure, and they are fueled by an updraft atmospheric gasifier, through the syngas conditioning train for tar removal and syngas compression. The system was brought to steady state; then several perturbations in open loop (variable speed) and closed loop (constant speed) were performed in order to characterize the IGFC behavior. Coupled experiments and computations have shown the feasibility of relatively fast control of the plant as well as a possible mitigation strategy to reduce the thermal stress on the fuel cells as a consequence of load variation and change in gasifier operating conditions. Results also provided an insight into the different features of variable versus constant speed operation of the gas turbine section.","","","National Energy Technology Lab.

In situ high energy resolution fluorescence detection X-ray absorption spectroscopy at the Pt L(3) edge reveals characteristic changes of the shape and intensity of the 'white-line' due to chemisorption of atomic hydrogen (H(ad)) at low potentials and oxygen-containing species (O/OH(ad)) at high potentials. On a uniform, two-dimensional Pt monolayer grown by Pt evaporation in ultrahigh vacuum, we observe a significant destabilization of both H(ad) and O/OH(ad) due to strain and ligand effects induced by the underlying Rh(111) substrate. When Pt is deposited via a wet-chemical route, by contrast, three-dimensional Pt islands are formed. In this case, strain and Rh ligand effects are balanced with higher local thickness of the Pt islands as well as higher defect density, shifting H and OH adsorption energies back toward pure Pt. Using density functional theory, we calculate O adsorption energies and corresponding local ORR activities for fcc 3-fold hollow sites with various local geometries that are present in the three-dimensional Pt islands.","","http://www.slac.stanford.edu/cgi-wrap/pubpage?slac-pub-15039.html","SLAC National Accelerator Lab., Menlo Park, CA (United States)","USDOE Office of Science (SC), Basic Energy Sciences (BES); Lundbeck Foundation, Danish Center for Scientific Computing, Alexander von Humboldt Foundation","","United States","2012-05-31T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: J.Amer.Chem.Soc. 134:9664-9671,2012; Journal Volume: 134; Journal Issue: 23","","Medium: ED; Size: 18 pages","","SLAC-PUB-15039","AC02-76SF00515","Journal ID: ISSN 0002-7863; JACSAT; TRN: US201213%%523","10.1021/ja3003765","","2013-05-09T00:00:00Z","1043861","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/1043861","https://www.osti.gov/servlets/purl/1043861","J.Amer.Chem.Soc. 134:9664-9671,2012","23","134"

All the glasses have been prepared by melt-quench technique. The in situ follow up of sintering behavior of glass powders has been done by high temperature - environmental scanning electron microscope (HT-ESEM) and hot-stage microscope (HSM) while the crystalline phase evolution and assemblage has been analyzed by x-ray diffraction (XRD) and scanning electron microscopy (SEM). All the glass compositions exhibit a glass-in-glass phase separation followed by two stage sintering resulting in well sintered glass powder compacts after heat treatment at 850 C for 1 h. Diopside (CaMgSi{sub 2}O{sub 6}) based phases constituted the major crystalline part in glass-ceramics followed by some minor phases. The increase in lanthanide content in glasses suppressed their tendency towards devitrification, thus, resulting in glass-ceramics with high amount of residual glassy phase (50-96 wt.%) which is expected to facilitate their self-healing behavior during SOFC operation. The electrical conductivity of the investigated glass-ceramics varied between (1.19 and 7.33) x 10{sup -7} S cm{sup -1} (750-800 C), and depended on the ionic field strength of lanthanide cations. Further experimentation with respect to the long term thermal and chemical stability of residual glassy phase under SOFC operation conditions along with high temperature viscosity measurements will be required in order to elucidate the potential of these glass-ceramics as self-healing sealants.","","","Pacific Northwest National Lab.

The overall and local PEMFC performances are determined by several primary loss mechanisms, namely activation, ohmic, and mass transfer. Spatial performance and loss variabilities are significant and depend on the cell design and operating conditions. A segmented cell system was used to quantify different loss distributions along the gas channel to understand the effects of gas humidification. A reduction in the reactant stream humidification decreased cell performance and resulted in non-uniform distributions of overpotentials and performance along the flow field. Activation and ohmic overpotentials increased with a relative humidity decrease due to insufficient membrane and catalyst layer hydration. The relative humidity of the cathode had a strong impact on the mass transfer overpotential due to a lower oxygen permeability through the dry Nafion film covering the catalyst surface. The mass transfer loss distribution was non-uniform, and the mass transfer overpotential increased for the outlet segments due to the oxygen consumption at the inlet segments, which reduced the oxygen concentration downstream, and a progressive water accumulation from upstream segments. Electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) and an equivalent electric circuit (EEC) facilitated the analysis and interpretation of the segmented cell data.","","","National Renewable Energy Lab.

Applications for SOFCs encompass a large range of power levels including 1-2 kW residential combined heat and power applications, 100-250 kW sized systems for distributed generation and grid extension, and MW-scale power plants utilizing coal. This paper reports on the development of a highly efficient, small-scale SOFC power system operating on methane. The system uses adiabatic steam reforming of methane and anode gas recirculation to achieve high net electrical efficiency. The anode exit gas is recirculated and all of the heat and water required for the endothermic reforming reaction are provided by the anode gas emerging from the SOFC stack. Although the single-pass fuel utilization is only about 55%, because of the anode gas recirculation the overall fuel utilization is up to 93%. The demonstrated system achieved gross power output of 1650 to 2150 watts with a maximum net LHV efficiency of 56.7% at 1720 watts. Overall system efficiency could be further improved to over 60% with use of properly sized blowers.","","","Pacific Northwest National Lab.

Following the aging protocol, the bulk and surface chemistry of the samples were similar, with graphite content increasing or remaining constant and Pt-carbide decreasing for all samples.

SOFC anode supports composed of Ni and yttria-stabilized zirconia (YSZ) were subjected to extended operation and selected regions were imaged using a transmission X-ray microscope. X-ray nanotomography provides unique insight into microstructure changes of all three phases (Ni, YSZ, pore) in three spatial dimensions, and its relation to performance degradation. Statistically significant 3D microstructural changes were observed in the anode Ni phase over a range of operational times, including phase size growth and changes in connectivity, interfacial contact area and contiguous triple-phase boundary length. These observations support microstructural evolution correlated to SOFC performance. We find that Ni coarsening is driven by particle curvature as indicated by the dihedral angles between the Ni, YSZ and pore phases, and hypothesize that growth occurs primarily by means of diffusion and particle agglomeration constrained by a pinning mechanism related to the YSZ phase. The decrease in Ni phase size after extended periods of time may be the result of a second process connected to a mobility-induced decrease in the YSZ phase size or non-uniform curvature resulting in a net decrease in Ni phase size.","","","Brookhaven National Lab.

In particular, the polymer composite membranes such as SiO2 incorporated Nafion membranes are recently reported as highly promising for the redox flow batteries. However, there is conflicting reports regarding the performance of this Nafion-SiO2 composite membrane in the redox flow cell. This paper presents results of the analysis of the Nafion-SiO2 composite membrane used in a vanadium redox flow battery by nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy, X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS), Fourier Transformed Infra Red (FTIR) spectroscopy, and ultraviolet visible spectroscopy. The XPS study reveals the chemical identity and environment of vanadium cations accumulated at the surface. On the other hand, the 19F and 29Si NMR measurement explores the nature of the interaction between the silica particles, Nafion side chains and diffused vanadium cations. The 29Si NMR shows that the silica particles interaction via hydrogen bonds to the sulfonic groups of Nafion and diffused vanadium cations. Based on these spectroscopic studies, the chemical environment of the silica particles inside the Nafion membrane and their interaction with diffusing vanadium cations during flow cell operations are discussed. This study discusses the origin of performance degradation of the Nafion-SiO2 composite membrane materials in vanadium redox flow batteries.","","","Pacific Northwest National Lab.

Three pairs of ionomers containing similar electron withdrawing groups within the pair were chosen for the study: two fully fluorinated sulfonyl imides (CF3SO2NHSO2CF3 and CF3CF2SO2NHSO2CF3), two partially fluorinated sulfonyl imides (CH3SO2NHSO2CF3 and C6H5SO2NHSO2CF2CF3), and two aromatic sulfonic acid based material s (CH3C6H4SO3H and CH3 OC6 - H3OCH3C6H4SO3H). Fully optimized counterpoise (CP) corrected geometries were obtained for each ionomer fragment with the inclusion of water molecules at the B3LYP/6-311G** level of density functional theory. Spontaneous proton dissociation was observed upon addition of three water molecules in each system, and the transition to a solvent-separated ion pair occurred when four water molecules were introduced. No considerable quantitative or qualitative differences in proton dissociation, hydrogen bond networks formed, or water binding energies were found between systems containing similar electron withdrawing groups. Each of the sulfonyl imide ionomers exhibited qualitatively similar results regarding proton dissociation and separation. The fully fluorinated sulfonyl imides, however, showed a greater propensity to exist in dissociated and ion-pair separated states at low degrees of hydration than the partially fluorinated sulfonyl imides. This effect is due to the additional electron withdrawing groups providing charge stabilization as the dissociated proton migrates away from the imide anion.","","","Pacific Northwest National Lab.

The activity can be further improved by manipulating the Pt{sub 3}Pb-Pt core-shell structure. Combined experimental and theoretical studies suggest that the high activity from Pt{sub 3}Pb and the Pt-Pb core-shell nanocrystals results from the elimination of CO poisoning and decreased barriers for the dehydrogenation steps.

Nanostructured materials often exhibit physical properties which differ from their bulk counterparts due to the increased importance of the surface in determining the thermodynamics and behavior of the system. Thus, control of the characteristic size, porosity, morphology, and surface area presents opportunities to tailor new materials which are useful platforms for elucidating the fundamental processes related to energy conversion and storage. The ability to produce high purity materials with direct control of relevant film parameters such as porosity, film thickness, and film morphology is of immediate interest in the fields of electrochemistry, photocatalysis, and thermal catalysis. Studies of various photoactive materials have introduced questions concerning the effects of film architecture and surface structure on the performance of the materials, while recent work has demonstrated that nanostructured, mesoporous, or disordered materials often deform plastically, making them robust in applications where volumetric expansion and phase transformations occur, such as in materials for lithium-ion batteries. Moreover, renewed emphasis has been placed on the formation of semi-conductive electrodes with controlled pore-size and large surface areas for the study and application of pseudo-capacitance and cation insertion processes for electrical energy storage. Understanding how the performance of such materials depends on morphology, porosity, and surface structure and area requires a synthesis technique which provides for incremental variations in structure and facilitates assessment of the performance with the appropriate analytical tools, preferably those that provide both structural information and kinetic insight into photoelectrochemical processes.","","","Pacific Northwest National Lab.

Although gaseous O{sub 2} is always present during the ORR, the majority of previous Pt surface oxide studies were conducted in the absence of O{sub 2} due to experimental limitations. In this study, multiple in situ techniques were applied to study the ORR on platinum in the presence of O{sub 2}. The thin channel flow Pt electrode and the electrochemical quartz microbalance (EQCM) techniques on Pt polycrystalline electrodes suggest that the influence of O{sub 2} in the electrolyte on mass change and charge transfer is negligible. The oxide formation followed a logarithm-growth behavior initiating as early as 0.2 s after potential steps. This suggests that no slow conversion of oxide species (e.g., between OH{sub ads} and O{sub ads}) takes place. Despite the negligible effect of O{sub 2} on the measured oxide coverage, steady-state X-ray absorption spectroscopy (XAS) measurements conducted on dispersed Pt nanoparticles suggested that, only when under O{sub 2}-sparging, place exchange between adsorbed oxide(s) and the Pt surface layer(s) initiated at potentials as low as 0.75 V. This is significantly lower than that observed in an O{sub 2}-free electrolyte (&gt;1.1 V). The effects of O{sub 2} on adsorbed oxide species illustrate the complexities of applying model systems to the real world in order to arrive at a comprehensive description of both the oxygen reduction and the Pt dissolution processes.","","","Argonne National Lab.

Phosphorus nitrogen co-dopants within the tubes have a similar effect for acceptor molecules, but the P N bond can also accept charge, resulting in affinity towards donor molecules. This molecular selectivity is illustrated in CO and NH3 adsorbed on PN-doped nanotubes, O2 on P-doped nanotubes, and NO2 and SO2 on both P- and PN-doped nanotubes. The adsorption of different chemical species onto the doped nanotubes modifies the dopant-induced localized states, which subsequently alter the electronic conductance. Although SO2 and CO adsorptions cause minor shifts in electronic conductance, NH3, NO2, and O2 adsorptions induce the suppression of a conductance dip. Conversely, the adsorption of NO2 on PN-doped nanotubes is accompanied with the appearance of an additional dip in conductance, correlated with a shift of the existing ones. Overall these changes in electric conductance provide an efficient way to detect selectively the presence of specific molecules. Additionally, the high oxidation potential of the P-doped nanotubes makes them good candidates for electrode materials in hydrogen fuel cells.","","","Oak Ridge National Lab.

In this study, we have used oxygen plasma assisted molecular beam epitaxy (OPA-MBE) to grow samaria doped ceria (SDC), to understand the role of dopant concentration and geometry of the films towards the ionic conduction in these thin films. We have also discussed the Gd doped CeO2 (GDC) and Gd stabilized ZrO2 (GSZ) multi-layer thin films to investigate the effect of interfacial phenomena on the ionic conductivity of these hetero-structures. We found the optimum concentration to be 15 mol % SmO1.5, for achieving lowest electrical resistance in SDC thin films. The electrical resistance decreases with the increase in film thickness up to 200 nm. The results demonstrate the usefulness of this study towards establishing an optimum dopant concentration and choosing an appropriate thin film thickness to ameliorate the conductance of the SDC material system. Furthermore, we have explored the conductivity of highly oriented GDC and GSZ multi-layer thin films, wherein the conductivity increased with an increase in the number of layers. The extended defects and lattice strain near the interfaces increase the density of oxygen vacancies, which leads to enhanced ionic conductivity in multi-layer thin films.","","","Pacific Northwest National Lab.

Among various Pd-Sn catalysts, Pd{sub 86}Sn{sub 14}/C catalysts showed much enhanced current densities in cyclic voltammetric and chronoamperometric measurements, compared to commercial Pd/C (Johnson Matthey). The overall rate law of ethanol oxidation reaction for both Pd{sub 86}Sn{sub 14}/C and commercial Pd/C were also determined, which clearly showed that Pd{sub 86}Sn{sub 14}/C was more favorable in high ethanol concentration and/or high pH environment. Density functional theory calculations also confirmed Pd-Sn alloy structures would result in lower reaction energies for the dehydrogenation of ethanol, compared to the pure Pd crystal.","","","Brookhaven National Lab.

AB was selected by DOE's Hydrogen Storage Engineering Center of Excellence (HSECoE) as the initial chemical hydride of study because of its high hydrogen storage capacity (up to 19.6% by weight for the release of {approx}2.5 molar equivalents of hydrogen gas) and its stability under typical ambient conditions. A new systems concept based on augers, ballast tank, hydrogen heat exchanger and H2 burner was designed and implemented in simulation. In this design, the chemical hydride material was assumed to produce H2 on the augers itself, thus minimizing the size of ballast tank and reactor. One dimensional models based on conservation of mass, species and energy were used to predict important state variables such as reactant and product concentrations, temperatures of various components, flow rates, along with pressure, in various components of the storage system. Various subsystem components in the models were coded as C language S-functions and implemented in Matlab/Simulink environment. The control variable AB (or alane) flow rate was determined through a simple expression based on the ballast tank pressure, H2 demand from the fuel cell and hydrogen production from AB (or alane) in the reactor. System simulation results for solid AB, liquid AB and alane for both steady state and transient drive cycle cases indicate the usefulness of the model for further analysis and prototype development.","","","Pacific Northwest National Lab.

"DEGRADATION ISSUES IN SOLID OXIDE CELLS DURING HIGH TEMPERATURE ELECTROLYSIS","Sohal, M S; O'Brien, J E; Stoots, C M; Sharma, V I; Yildiz, B; Virkar, A","08 HYDROGEN; 30 DIRECT ENERGY CONVERSION; ELECTRODES; ELECTROLYSIS; ELECTROLYTES; FLOW RATE; HYDROGEN; IDAHO NATIONAL LABORATORY; LTE; OXIDES; OXYGEN; PLATES; SIMULATION; SOLID OXIDE FUEL CELLS; TESTING; THERMODYNAMICS; cells; degradation; electrolysis; hydrogen","Idaho National Laboratory (INL) is performing high-temperature electrolysis research to generate hydrogen using solid oxide electrolysis cells (SOECs). The project goals are to address the technical and degradation issues associated with the SOECs. This paper provides a summary of various ongoing INL and INL sponsored activities aimed at addressing SOEC degradation. These activities include stack testing, post-test examination, degradation modeling, and a list of issues that need to be addressed in future. Major degradation issues relating to solid oxide fuel cells (SOFC) are relatively better understood than those for SOECs. Some of the degradation mechanisms in SOFCs include contact problems between adjacent cell components, microstructural deterioration (coarsening) of the porous electrodes, and blocking of the reaction sites within the electrodes. Contact problems include delamination of an electrode from the electrolyte, growth of a poorly (electronically) conducting oxide layer between the metallic interconnect plates and the electrodes, and lack of contact between the interconnect and the electrode. INL's test results on high temperature electrolysis (HTE) using solid oxide cells do not provide a clear evidence whether different events lead to similar or drastically different electrochemical degradation mechanisms. Post-test examination of the solid oxide electrolysis cells showed that the hydrogen electrode and interconnect get partially oxidized and become non-conductive. This is most likely caused by the hydrogen stream composition and flow rate during cool down. The oxygen electrode side of the stacks seemed to be responsible for the observed degradation due to large areas of electrode delamination. Based on the oxygen electrode appearance, the degradation of these stacks was largely controlled by the oxygen electrode delamination rate. University of Utah (Virkar) has developed a SOEC model based on concepts in local thermodynamic equilibrium in systems otherwise in global thermodynamic non-equilibrium. This model is under continued development. It shows that electronic conduction through the electrolyte, however small, must be taken into account for determining local oxygen chemical potential, within the electrolyte. The chemical potential within the electrolyte may lie out of bounds in relation to values at the electrodes in the electrolyzer mode. Under certain conditions, high pressures can develop in the electrolyte just under the oxygen electrode (anode)/electrolyte interface, leading to electrode delamination. This theory is being further refined and tested by introducing some electronic conduction in the electrolyte.","","","Idaho National Lab.

Both the formate pathway and the reverse water-gas shift (RWGS) reaction followed by a CO hydrogenation pathway (RWGS + CO-Hydro) were considered in the study. Our calculations showed that the overall methanol yield increased in the sequence: Au/Cu(111) &lt; Cu(111) &lt; Pd/Cu(111) &lt; Rh/Cu(111) &lt; Pt/Cu(111) &lt; Ni/Cu(111). On Au/Cu(111) and Cu(111), the formate pathway dominates the methanol production. Doping Au does not help the methanol synthesis on Cu(111). Pd, Rh, Pt, and Ni are able to promote the methanol production on Cu(111), where the conversion via the RWGS + CO-Hydro pathway is much faster than that via the formate pathway. Further kinetic analysis revealed that the methanol yield on Cu(111) was controlled by three factors: the dioxomethylene hydrogenation barrier, the CO binding energy, and the CO hydrogenation barrier. Accordingly, two possible descriptors are identified which can be used to describe the catalytic activity of Cu-based catalysts toward methanol synthesis. One is the activation barrier of dioxomethylene hydrogenation, and the other is the CO binding energy. An ideal Cu-based catalyst for the methanol synthesis via CO{sub 2} hydrogenation should be able to hydrogenate dioxomethylene easily and bond CO moderately, being strong enough to favor the desired CO hydrogenation rather than CO desorption but weak enough to prevent CO poisoning. In this way, the methanol production via both the formate and the RWGS + CO-Hydro pathways can be facilitated.","","","Brookhaven National Lab. (BNL), Upton, NY (United States).

It is thus important to understand the effect of environmental exposure of metal hydrides in the case of accident scenarios. Simulated tests were performed following the United Nations standards to test for flammability and water reactivity in air for a destabilized lithium borohydride and magnesium hydride system in a 2 to 1 molar ratio respectively. It was determined that the mixture acted similarly to the parent, lithium borohydride, but at slower rate of reaction seen in magnesium hydride. To quantify environmental exposure kinetics, isothermal calorimetry was utilized to measure the enthalpy of reaction as a function of exposure time to dry and humid air, and liquid water. The reaction with liquid water was found to increase the heat flow significantly during exposure compared to exposure in dry or humid air environments. Calorimetric results showed the maximum normalized heat flow the fully charged material was 6 mW/mg under liquid phase hydrolysis; and 14 mW/mg for the fully discharged material also occurring under liquid phase hydrolysis conditions.","","available","Savannah River Site (SRS), Aiken, SC (United States)","USDOE","","United States","2012-01-10T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: International Journal of Hydrogen Energy; Journal Volume: 37; Journal Issue: 3","","Medium: ED; Size: 2885","","SRNL-STI-2012-00012","DE-AC09-08SR22470","Journal ID: ISSN 0360-3199; IJHEDX; TRN: US201202%%506","10.1016/j.ijhydene.2011.05.170","","2012-12-05T00:00:00Z","1032955","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/1032955","https://www.osti.gov/servlets/purl/1032955","International Journal of Hydrogen Energy","3","37"

This paper describes the initial results of in-situ x-ray diffraction (XRD) of the cathode on an operating anode-supported solid oxide fuel cell. It has been demonstrated that XRD measurements of the cathode can be performed simultaneously with electrochemical measurements of cell performance or electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS). While improvements to the technique are still to be made, the XRD pattern of a lanthanum strontium cobalt ferrite (LSCF) cathode with the composition La0.6Sr0.4Co0.2Fe0.8O3-δ (LSCF-6428) was found to continually but gradually change over the course of more than 60 hours of operation in air under typical SOFC operating conditions. It was determined that the most significant change was a gradual increase in the cubic lattice parameters of the LSCF from 3.92502 Å (as determined from the integration of the first 20 hours of XRD patterns) to 3.92650 Å (from the integration of the last 20 hours). This analysis also revealed that there were several peaks from unidentified minor phases that increased in intensity over this timeframe. After a temporary loss of airflow early in the test, the cell generated between 225 and 250 mW/cm2 for the remainder of the test. A large low frequency arc in the impedance spectra suggests the cell performance was gas diffusion limited and that there is room for improvement in air delivery to the cell.","","","Pacific Northwest National Lab.

However, EFCs exhibit far less power output than PEMFCs and have relatively short life spans before materials must be replaced. In this work, electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) is used to analyze the internal resistances throughout the EFC at a variety of operating conditions. EIS analysis is focused primarily on the resistances of the anode, solution/membrane, and cathode. Increased enzyme loading results in improved power output and reductions in internal resistance. Conditions are identified for which enzyme loading does not limit the EFC performance. EIS experiments are also reported for EFCs operated continuously for 2 days; power output declines sharply over time, while all internal resistances increase. Drying of the cathode and enzyme/mediator degradation are believed to have contributed to this behavior. Finally, experiments are performed at varying air-humidification temperatures. Little effect on internal resistances or power output is observed. However, it is anticipated that increased air humidification can improve longevity by delivering more water to the cathode. Improvements to the enzymatic cathode are needed for EFC development. These improvements need to focus on improving transport rather than increasing enzyme loading.","","","Oak Ridge National Lab.

The glass contains about 17 mole% alkalis (K+Na) and has low glass transition and softening temperatures. It remains vitreous and compliant around 750-800oC after sealing without substantial crystallization, as contrary to conventional glass-ceramic sealants, which experience rapid crystallization after the sealing process. The glassy nature and low characteristic temperatures can reduce residual stresses and result in the potential for crack healing. In a previous study, the glass was found to have good thermal cycle stability and was chemically compatible with YSZ coating during short term testing. In the current study, the compliant glass was further evaluated in a more realistic way in that the sealed glass couples were first isothermally aged for 1000h followed by thermal cycling. High temperature leakage was measured. The chemical compatibility was also investigated with powder mixtures at 700 and 800oC to enhance potential interfacial reaction. In addition, interfacial microstructure was examined with scanning electron microscopy and evaluated with regard to the leakage and chemical compatibility results.","","","Pacific Northwest National Lab.

As a result, they show promise for use in variety of applications: as reaction media, in batteries and supercapacitors, in solar and fuel cells, for electrochemical deposition of metals and semiconductors, for protein extraction and crystallization, and many others. Because of the ease with which they can be supercooled, ionic liquids offer new opportunities to investigate long-standing questions regarding the nature of the dynamic glass transition and its possible link to charge transport. Despite the significant steps achieved from experimental and theoretical studies, no generally accepted quantitative theory of dynamic glass transition to date has been capable of reproducing all the experimentally observed features. In this Account, we discuss recent studies of the interplay between charge transport and glassy dynamics in ionic liquids as investigated by a combination of several experimental techniques including broadband dielectric spectroscopy, pulsed field gradient nuclear magnetic resonance, dynamic mechanical spectroscopy, and differential scanning calorimetry. Based on EinsteinSmoluchowski relations, we use dielectric spectra of ionic liquids to determine diffusion coefficients in quantitative agreement with independent pulsed field gradient nuclear magnetic resonance measurements, but spanning a broader range of more than 10 orders of magnitude. This approach provides a novel opportunity to determine the electrical mobility and effective number density of charge carriers as well as their types of thermal activation from the measured dc conductivity separately. We also unravel the origin of the remarkable universality of charge transport in different classes of glass-forming ionic liquids.","","","Oak Ridge National Lab.

To maintain high ionic conductivity and improve the stability in the whole electrolyte, layered structures with YSZ outer layers and SCSZ inner layers were designed. Because of a mismatch of coefficients of thermal expansion and Young's moduli of SCSZ and YSZ phases, upon cooling of the electrolytes after sintering, thermal residual stresses will arise, leading to a possible strengthening of the layered composite and, therefore, an increase in the reliability of the electrolyte. Laminated electrolytes with three, four, and six layers design were manufactured using tape-casting, lamination, and sintering techniques. After sintering, while the thickness of YSZ outer layers remained constant at 30 m, the thickness of the SCSZ inner layer varied from 30 m for a Y SC Y three-layered electrolyte, 60 m for a Y 2SC Y four-layered electrolyte, and 120 m for a Y 4SC Y six-layered electrolyte.

In Part I of this study, m is determined for 441 sintered hydroxyapatite (HA) specimens fractured in biaxial flexure for 0.08 P 0.62. In this study, we analyze a combined data set collected from the literature that represents work from a total of 17 different research groups (including the present authors), eight different materials and more than 1560 oxide and non-oxide specimens, the m versus P plot is Ushaped with a wide band of m values for P < 0.1 (Region I) and P > 0.55 (Region III), and a narrower band of m values in the intermediate porosity region of 0.1 < P < 0.55 (Region II). The limited range of m ( 4 < m < 11) in Region II has important implications since Region II includes the P range for the majority of the applications of porous brittle materials.

Therefore, it can only proceed at locations where gas, electronic conductor, and an oxygen ion conductor meet. Although the extension of the reaction zone beyond the traditional so-called triple-phase-boundary (TPB) is widely accepted for a mixed ionically and electronically conductive cathode, work in this area has yet to reach a consensus on how far the reaction zone can be extended. In this study, anode-supported fuel cells with a variety of LSCF cathode thicknesses were fabricated and tested in two cathode environments, flowing oxygen and flowing air. In flowing oxygen, the cell performance increased with LSCF cathode thickness over the entire range investigated (from 5 to 33 μm). In flowing air, the cell performance also increased with the LSCF cathode thickness from 5 to 13 μm, but then remained almost constant with further increase in cathode thickness. In flowing oxygen, since there was no concentration polarization related to oxygen diffusion, the polarization resistance of oxygen reduction decreased with the LSCF cathode thickness because of the increased number of reaction sites. A linear relationship was established between the reciprocal of the polarization resistance and the cathode thickness, which was explained by a model developed for aqueous gas diffusion electrodes.","Elsevier","","Pacific Northwest National Lab.

It was determined that the most favorable catalyst composition (prior to calcination) had a CB:PPY weight ratio of 2 and a pyrrole:Co (i.e., PY:Co) molar ratio of 4. This catalyst had an onset potential of 0.785 V (vs. RHE) and a mass activity of ca. 1 A/g{sub cata} at the fuel cell relevant voltage of 0.65 V. Furthermore, it was found that the number of electrons exchanged during the ORR with the catalyst was ca. 3.5 and resulted in 28% yield of H{sub 2}O{sub 2} at 0.65 V, which hints to an indirect 4e{sup -} reduction of O{sub 2} to H{sub 2}O, with H{sub 2}O{sub 2} as an intermdiate. From energy dispersive spectroscopy (EDS) and extended X-ray absorption fine structure (EXAFS) analysis, it is proposed that a PY:Co ratio of 4 favors the formation, prior to calcination, in the catalyst precursor of Co-N complexes in which Co is coordinated to 3 or 4 N atoms, resulting in strong Co-N interactions that limit the formation upon calcination of low ORR activity Co nanoparticles. These Co-N complexes give rise upon calcination to CoN{sub x-2} sites in which the coordination of Co could favor the adsorption on them of O{sub 2}, which would make those sites particularly active and selective. At the same mass acitivity of 1 A/g{sub cata}, the voltage yielded by the catalyst was 200 mV lower than that for a state-of-the-art Pt (10 wt.%) catalyst, whoch H{sub 2}O{sub 2} output at 0.85 V was 39% and involves the exchange of 3.2 e{sup -}, overall making our material an attractive substitute to noble metal ORR electrocatalysts.","","","Brookhaven National Lab.

Using Ni nanoparticles as the templates, we fabricated compact and smooth Pt hollow nanocrystals that exhibit a sustained enhancement in Pt mass activity for oxygen reduction in acid fuel cells. This is achieved by the hollow-induced lattice contraction, high surface area per mass, and oxidation-resistant surface morphology - a new route for enhancing both the catalysts activity and durability.

The EXAFS analysis is consistent with the model wherein the IrNi nanoparticles are composed of two-layer Ir shells and IrNi alloy cores. In situ XAS revealed that the Ir shells completely protect Ni atoms in the cores from oxidation or dissolution in an acid electrolyte under elevated potentials. The formation of Ir shell during annealing due to thermal segregation is monitored by time-resolved synchrotron XRD measurements, coupled with Rietveld refinement analyses. The H{sub 2} oxidation activity of the IrNi nanoparticles was found to be higher than that of a commercial Pt/C catalyst. This is predominantly due to Ni-core-induced Ir shell contraction that makes the surface less reactive for IrOH formation, and the resulting more metallic Ir surface becomes more active for H{sub 2} oxidation. This new class of core-shell nanoparticles appears promising for application as hydrogen anode fuel cell electrocatalysts.","","","Brookhaven National Lab.

In this work, we investigate strained 40-nm films of perovskite La{sub 0.5}Sr{sub 0.5}CoO{sub 3-{delta}}, which is an important material for solid oxide fuel cell cathodes and oxygen separation membranes.

The ordered phase consists of La and Sr cations in planes parallel to the surface and is associated with coherent expansion in the c-direction of {approx}5%.

The cathode employing carbon-supported platinum nanoparticles (Pt/C) was exposed to 4 ppm HCl in air while the cell voltage was held at 0.6 V. The HCl poisoning results in generation of chloride and chloroplatinate ions on the surface of Pt/C catalyst as determined by a combination of electrochemical tests and ex-situ chlorine K-edge X-Ray absorption near-edge structure (XANES) spectroscopy. The chloride ions inhibit the oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) and likely affect the wetting properties of diffusion media/catalyst layer, while the chloroplatinate ions are responsible for enhanced platinum particle growth most likely due to platinum dissolution-redeposition. The chloride ions can cause corrosion of the Pt nanoparticles in the presence of aqueous HCl in air even if no potential is applied. Although the majority of chloride ions are desorbed from the Pt surface by hydrogen treatment of the cathode, they partially remain in the system and re-adsorb on platinum at cell voltages of 0.5-0.9 V. Chloride ions are removed from the system and fuel cell performance at 0.5-0.7 V is restored by multiple exposures to low potentials.","","","Brookhaven National Lab.

A NiO phase was found to develop along the Ni/YSZ interfaces extending to TPBs in the operated cells. The thickness of the NiO ribbon phase remains constant at ~5 nm in hydrogen for operating durations up to 540 h. When operating on synthesis gas, an increase in interphase thickness was observed from ~11 nm for 24 h of operation to ~51 nm for 550 h of operation. YSZ phases are observed to be stable in H2 over 540 h of operation. However, for the cell operated in syngas for 550 h, a 5–10 nm tetragonal YSZ (t-YSZ) interfacial layer was identified that originated from the Ni/YSZ interfaces. Yttrium species seem to segregate to the interfaces during operation, leading to the formation of t-YSZ in the Y-depleted regions.","","","National Energy Technology Lab.

Isothermal crystallization rates and pseudo-steady-state nucleation rates are obtained as a function of subcooling from heat-flow and induction-time measurements. Kinetics of ice nucleation and growth are studied at two polytetrafluoroethylene (PTFE) loadings (0 and 10 wt %) in a commercial GDL for temperatures between 240 and 273 K. A nonlinear ice-crystallization rate expression is developed using Johnson–Mehl–Avrami–Kolmogorov (JMAK) theory, in which the heat-transfer-limited growth rate is determined from the moving-boundary Stefan problem. Induction times follow a Poisson distribution and increase upon addition of PTFE, indicating that nucleation occurs more slowly on a hydrophobic fiber than on a hydrophilic fiber. The determined nucleation rates and induction times follow expected trends from classical nucleation theory. Finally, a validated rate expression is now available for predicting ice-crystallization kinetics in GDLs.","American Chemical Society","","Lawrence Berkeley National Lab.

These surfaces help in reducing the overpotential associated with anodic CO oxidation and minimize the amount of Pt used, thereby reducing materials cost.

The infrared Stark tuning plots of CO adsorbed on Pt at 100, 200, 300 and 400 mV vs. hydrogen reference electrode were obtained. The Stark tuning plots of CO adsorbed at 400 mV exhibit a precipitous drop in frequency coincident with the adsorption potential. The turn-down potential decreases relative to the adsorption potential and is approximately constant after 300 mV. These Stark tuning characteristics are attributed to potential dependent adsorption site selection by CO and competitive adsorption processes.","","","Argonne National Lab.

Electrochemical behaviors of the cathode based on graphitic mesoporous carbon supported Pt catalyst were examined using electrochemical impedance spectroscopy and cyclic voltammetry. Impedance data were plotted and expressed in the complex capacitance form to determine useful parameters in the transmission line model: the double-layer capacitance, peak frequency, and ionic resistance. Electrochemical surface area and hydrogen crossover current through the membrane were estimated from cyclic voltammogram, while cathode Faradaic resistance was compared with ionic resistance as a function of test time. It was observed that during an accelerated stress test of catalyst support, graphitic mesoporous carbon becomes hydrophilic which increases interfacial area between the ionomer and the catalyst up to 100 h. However, the ionic resistance in the catalyst layer drastically increases after 100 h with further carbon support oxidation. The underlying mechanism has been studied and it was found that significant degradation of ionic pathway throughout the catalyst layer due to catalyst support corrosion induces uneven hydration and mechanical stress in the ionomer.","","","Pacific Northwest National Lab.

The morphology and composition of these hydrated membranes significantly affects their transport properties and performance. This research demonstrates that differences in interfacial interactions between the membranes exposed to vapor or liquid water can cause significant changes in kinetics of water uptake. In situ small-angle X-ray scattering (SAXS) experiments captured the rapid swelling of the membrane in liquid water with a nanostructure rearrangement on the order of seconds. For membranes in contact with water vapor, morphological changes are four orders-of-magnitude slower than in liquid water, suggesting that interfacial resistance limits the penetration of water into the membrane. Furthermore, upon water absorption from liquid water, a structural rearrangement from a distribution of spherical and cylindrical domains to exclusively cylindrical-like domains is suggested. These differences in water-uptake kinetics and morphology provide a new perspective into Schroeder's paradox, which dictates a different water content for vapor- and liquid-equilibrated ionomers at unit activity. Lastly, the findings of this work provide critical insights into the fast kinetics of water absorption of the Nafion membrane, which can aid in the design of energy conversion devices that operate under frequent changes in environmental conditions.","American Chemical Society","","Lawrence Berkeley National Lab.

They also exhibit interesting magnetic properties such as high-temperature antiferromagnetism, making them useful for data storage applications. The compounds adopt a distorted perovskite-type structure where the tilt angle of the octahedra increases (Fe-O-Fe bond angle decreases) as the size of the rare-earth atom decreases. Despite intensive study of the physical properties of these compounds, very few studies have investigated how the bonding and electronic structure of these systems change with substitution of the RE. X-ray absorption near-edge spectroscopy (XANES) is a technique well-suited for such a study, and, in view of this, Fe L-, Fe K- and O K-edge spectra from a series of REFeO{sub 3} compounds (RE=La, Pr, Nd, Sm, Eu, Gd, Ho, Yb, Y) have been collected, and are presented here. Fe L-edge spectra show that Fe is octahedrally coordinated and that the Fe-centered octahedra do not appear to distort with changes in the identity of the RE. The Fe K-edge spectra contain an intersite hybrid peak, which is an ill-studied feature that is attributed to non-local transitions of 1s electrons to 3d states on the next-nearest-neighbor atom that are hybridized with 4p states on the absorbing atom through O 2p states. In this study, it is shown that the intensity of this feature is strongly dependent on the Fe-O-Fe bond angle; the lower the Fe-O-Fe bond angle, the less intense the intersite hybrid peak is.","","","Argonne National Lab.

Cells using 50-mol% In-Sb and Sn-Sb mixtures exhibited open-circuit voltages (OCV) of 1.0 and 0.93 V, values that are identical to that of cell with pure In and Sn respectively. Also similar to the pure In and Sn anodes, the impedances of these cells were initially low but increased dramatically after drawing a small amount of charge, implying formation of In₂O₃ and SnO₂ layers at the electrolyte interface. The 50-mol% Sb-Bi cell had an OCV of 0.73 V initially, close to the OCV observed with pure Sb. The OCV remained constant until a charge identical to that required for oxidation of all the Sb had been passed, after which the OCV dropped to 0.43 V, similar to the value for pure Bi. SEM analysis of the cell after conversion of the Sb showed two distinct phases, with metallic Bi at the bottom and Sb₂O₃ at the top. The electrochemical oxidation of 50-mol% Sb-Pb alloys exhibited an OCV that changed continuously with conversion, from 0.73 V initially to 0.67 V following the addition of charge corresponding to oxidation of 120% the Sb. The total cell impedance remained low for this entire period.

Doping with Cu significantly facilitated densification of yttrium chromite. Ni dopant improved both electrical conductivity and dimensional stability in reducing environments, likely through diminishing the oxygen vacancy formation. Substitution with Co substantially enhanced electrical conductivity in oxidizing atmosphere, which was attributed to an increase in charge carrier density and hopping mobility. Electrical conductivity of Y0.8Ca0.2Cr0.85Co0.1Ni0.04Cu0.01O3 at 900 degree C is 57 S/cm in air and 11 S/cm in fuel (pO2=5×10^-17 atm) environments.

Nanoislands of SnO{sub x} are deposited onto the Pt(111) by reactive layer assisted deposition in which Sn metal is vapor deposited onto a Pt(111) surface precovered by NO{sub 2}. X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) shows that the SnO{sub x} islands are highly reduced with Sn{sup 2+} being the dominant chemical species. After exposing the SnO{sub x}/Pt(111) surface to H{sub 2}O or an electrolyte solution, XPS provides evidence for a significant amount of H{sub 2}O/OH adsorbed on the reduced SnO{sub x} surfaces. Electrochemical testing reveals that the catalytic performance of Pt(111) toward ethanol electrooxidation is significantly enhanced with SnO{sub x} islands added onto the surface. The enhanced EOR activity is tentatively attributed to the efficient removal of CO{sub ads}-like poisoning species at Pt sites by oxygen-containing species that are readily formed on the SnO{sub x} nanoislands. Moreover, the strong dependence of the EOR activity on SnO{sub x} coverage provides experimental evidence for the importance of SnO{sub x}-Pt interface sites in the EOR.","","","Brookhaven National Lab.

The sluggish kinetics of the ORR is a key barrier to the adaptation of fuel cells and currently limits their widespread use. Dealloyed Pt-Cu bimetallic nanoparticles, however, have been shown to exhibit uniquely high reactivity for this reaction. We first present evidence for the formation of a core-shell structure during dealloying, which involves removal of Cu from the surface and subsurface of the precursor nanoparticles. We then show that the resulting Pt-rich surface shell exhibits compressive strain that depends on the composition of the precursor alloy. We next demonstrate the existence of a downward shift of the Pt d-band, resulting in weakening of the bond strength of intermediate oxygenated species due to strain. Finally, we combine synthesis, strain, and catalytic reactivity in an experimental/theoretical reactivity-strain relationship which provides guidelines for the rational design of strained oxygen reduction electrocatalysts. The stoichiometry of the precursor, together with the dealloying conditions, provides experimental control over the resulting surface strain and thereby allows continuous tuning of the surface electrocatalytic reactivity - a concept that can be generalized to other catalytic reactions.","","http://www.slac.stanford.edu/cgi-wrap/pubpage?slac-pub-13826.html","SLAC National Accelerator Lab., Menlo Park, CA (United States)","USDOE","","United States","2011-08-19T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: Submitted to Nature Chemistry","","Medium: ED","","SLAC-PUB-13826","AC02-76SF00515","TRN: US201118%%216","","","2014-10-10T00:00:00Z","1022507","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/1022507","https://www.osti.gov/servlets/purl/1022507","Submitted to Nature Chemistry","",""

Both mass and specific activities of the catalysts were determined using rotating disk electrode and proton exchange membrane fuel cell. The mass activities extracted from the kinetic regions in both measurements revealed a consistent trend of decreasing activity with increasing temperature. However, the specific activity data from RDE revealed an opposite trend, i.e., increasing activity with increasing temperature. In addition to TEM, XRD and XPS characterizations, a detailed XAFS analysis of the atomic scale coordination structures was carried out, revealing increased hetero-atomic coordination with improved alloying structures for the catalyst treated at the elevated temperatures. XPS analysis has further revealed a reduced surface concentration of Pt for the catalyst for the high temperature treated catalyst. The higher mass activity for the lower temperature treated catalyst is due to Pt surface enrichment on the surface sites, whereas the higher specific activity for the higher temperature treated catalyst reflects an enhanced Pt-alloying surface sites. These findings have thus provided a new insight for assessing the structural correlation of the electrocatalytic activity with the fcc-type lattice change and the atomic scale alloying characteristics. Implications of these findings to the design of highly active alloy electrocatalysts are discussed, along with their enhanced electrocatalytic performance in the fuel cell.","","","Pacific Northwest National Lab.

Losses due to the electronic and ionic resistances, which are also known as ohmic losses in the form of Joule heating, can hinder the SOFC's performance. Ohmic losses can result from the bulk material resistivities as well as the complexities introduced by the cell's microstructure. In this work, two-dimensional (2D), electronic and ionic transport models are used to develop a method of quantification of the ohmic losses within the SOFC anode microstructure. This quantification is completed as a function of properties determined from a detailed microstructure characterization, namely, the tortuosity of the electronic and ionic phases, phase volume fraction, contiguity, and mean free path. A direct modeling approach at the level of the pore-scale microstructure is achieved through the use of a representative volume element (RVE) method. The correlation of these ohmic losses with the quantification of the SOFC anode microstructure are examined. It is found with this analysis that the contributions of the SOFC anode microstructure on ohmic losses can be correlated with the volume fraction, contiguity, and mean free path.","","","Argonne National Lab.

However, the implementation of ethanol fuel cell technology has been hindered by the lack of low-cost, highly active anode catalysts. In this paper, we have studied Iridium (Ir)-based binary catalysts as low-cost alternative electrocatalysts replacing platinum (Pt)-based catalysts for the direct ethanol fuel cell (DEFC) reaction. We report the synthesis of carbon supported Ir{sub 71}Sn{sub 29} catalysts with an average diameter of 2.7 {+-} 0.6 nm through a 'surfactant-free' wet chemistry approach. The complementary characterization techniques, including aberration-corrected scanning transmission electron microscopy equipped with electron energy loss spectroscopy, X-ray diffraction, X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy, and X-ray absorption spectroscopy, are used to identify the 'real' heterogeneous structure of Ir{sub 71}Sn{sub 29}/C particles as Ir/Ir-Sn/SnO{sub 2}, which consists of an Ir-rich core and an Ir-Sn alloy shell with SnO{sub 2} present on the surface. The Ir{sub 71}Sn{sub 29}/C heterogeneous catalyst exhibited high electrochemical activity toward the ethanol oxidation reaction compared to the commercial Pt/C (ETEK), PtRu/C (Johnson Matthey) as well as PtSn/C catalysts. Electrochemical measurements and density functional theory calculations demonstrate that the superior electro-activity is directly related to the high degree of Ir-Sn alloy formation as well as the existence of nonalloyed SnO{sub 2} on surface. Our cross-disciplinary work, from novel 'surfactant-free' synthesis of Ir-Sn catalysts, theoretical simulations, and catalytic measurements to the characterizations of 'real' heterogeneous nanostructures, will not only highlight the intriguing structure-property correlations in nanosized catalysts but also have a transformative impact on the commercialization of DEFC technology by replacing Pt with low-cost, highly active Ir-based catalysts.","","","Brookhaven National Lab.

Electrochemical performance was measured using a half-cell test set up with a rotating disc electrode and compared with a commercial platinum-on-carbon (Pt/C) catalyst. Overall, all of the oxide-based composite catalysts exhibit high ORR on-set potentials, comparable to that of the baseline Pt/C catalyst. The addition of tungsten oxide as a dopant to tantalum oxide greatly improved mass specific current density. Maximum performance was achieved with a catalyst containing 32 mol% of tungsten oxide, which exhibited a mass specific current density ~8% that of the Pt/C catalyst at 0.6 V vs. the normal hydrogen electrode (NHE) and ~35% that of the Pt/C catalyst at 0.2 V vs. NHE. Results from X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy analysis indicated that the tungsten cations in the composite catalysts exist in the +6 oxidation state, while the tantalum displays an average valence of +5, suggesting that the addition of tungsten likely creates an oxygen excess in the tantalum oxide structure that influences its oxygen absorption kinetics. When the 32mol% tungsten doped catalyst loading on the working electrode was increased to five times that of the original loading (which was equivalent to that of the baseline Pt/C catalyst), the area specific current density improved four fold, achieving an area specific current density ~35% that of the Pt/C catalyst at 0.6 V vs. NHE.","","","Pacific Northwest National Lab.

Proton Exchange Membrane Fuel Cells (PEMFCs) - with an efficiency higher than that of internal combustion engines, light weight, low operating temperature, and fast-start-up capability - are strong candidates for automotive applications. Transportation applications could be especially important in shaping up the new energy economy since they may entail a substantial decrease in the adverse environmental effects linked to the use of fossil fuels and prolong their availability. The largest portion of the cost of PEMFCs reflects the large amount of Pt needed in the cathode's catalytic layer due to the low catalytic activity of Pt for the oxygen reduction reaction (ORR). Recently, considerable advances have been made in fuel cell electrocatalysis yielding improved electrocatalysts, and increasing our understanding of the kinetics of the ORR in combination with significant advances in theoretical treatments. Some of these studies involved: (1) alloying Pt to synthesize bi-metallic catalysts, (2) core-shell nanoparticles catalysts, (3) the role of size, structure, and shape of nanoparticles, and (4) de-alloying of bimetallic alloys. However, a complete understanding of the ORR kinetics on Pt, the best single element catalyst, and of its low efficiency, is yet to be achieved. These problems, compounded with the high Pt content in current cathode catalysts, and with their gradual loss of performance under operating conditions, still hamper commercialization of fuel cells. In order to minimize the amount of noble metal electrocatalysts and maximize their utilization, while achieving high catalytic activity, numerous synthetic approaches have been attempted. The electrocatalysts were prepared using vacuum deposition methods, wet chemistry methods, or electrodeposition techniques. Electrodeposition in particular has several attractive features with respect to the application in catalyst synthesis such as simplicity of operation and ease of control of the deposition conditions. In this article we describe the application of metal electrodeposition in the synthesis of a new type of electrocatalysts comprising a Pt monolayer (Pt{sub ML}) on metal or alloy nanoparticles. The concept of Pt{sub ML} electrocatalysts offers a possible solution to the impasse caused by a slow ORR kinetics and the consequent large Pt content of conventional electrocatalysts. A Pt{sub ML} shell on a nanoparticle substrate core ensures that every Pt atom is available for catalytic activity; in other words, a Pt{sub ML} achieves the ultimate reduction in Pt loading and complete Pt utilization. Also, through geometric and electronic interaction with the substrate a Pt{sub ML} can change its electronic properties and be more active and durable than pure-Pt electrocatalysts.","","","Brookhaven National Lab.

At the high-temperature oxidation environment of solid oxide fuel cells (SOFCs), a combination of growth stress with thermal stresses may lead to scale delamination/buckling and eventual spallation during SOFC stack cooling, even leading to serious degradation of cell performance. The growth stress is induced by the growth of the oxide scale on the scale/substrate interface, and thermal stress is induced by a mismatch of the coefficient of thermal expansion between the oxide scale and the substrate. The numerical results show that the interfacial shear stresses, which are the driving force of scale delamination between the oxide scale and the ferritic substrate, increase with the growth of the oxide scale and also with the thickness of the ferritic substrate; i.e., the thick ferritic substrate can easily lead to scale delamination and spallation. Experimental observation confirmed the predicted results of the delamination and spallation of the oxide scale on the ferritic substrate.","","","Pacific Northwest National Lab.

The compositions of Y0.8Ca0.2Cr1-xNixO3±δ (x=0-0.15), prepared using the glycine nitrate process, showed single phase orthorhombic perovskite structures over a wide range of oxygen partial pressures (10^-17 atm ≤ pO2 ≤ 0.21 atm). X-ray diffraction (XRD) analysis indicated that most of the nickel ions replacing chromium ions are divalent and act as acceptor dopants, leading to a substantial increase in conductivity. In particular, the conductivity at 900 degree C in air increased from 10 S/cm to 34 S/cm with 15% nickel substitution, and an increase in charge carrier density was confirmed by Seebeck measurements. A point defect model was derived, and the relationship between electrical conductivity and oxygen partial pressure was successfully fitted into the proposed model. The defect modeling results indicated that nickel substitution improves the stability of calcium-doped yttrium chromite toward reduction and suppresses the oxygen vacancy formation, which results in significantly increased electrical conductivity in reducing environment. The electrical conductivity of Y0.8Ca0.2Cr0.85Ni0.15O3±δ at 900 degree C in reducing atmosphere (pO2=10^-17 atm) was 5.8 S/cm, which was more than an order of magnitude higher than that of Y0.8Ca0.2CrO3±δ (0.2 S/cm). Improved stability in reducing atmosphere was further confirmed by dilatometry measurements showing reduced isothermal ""chemical"" expansion, and the isothermal expansion in reducing atmosphere (pO2=10^-17 atm) at 900 degree C decreased from 0.07% for Y0.8Ca0.2CrO3±δ to 0.03% for Y0.8Ca0.2Cr0.85Ni0.15O3±δ. Based on these results, enhanced electrical performance and mechanical integrity is expected with nickel substitution on calcium-doped yttrium chromite in SOFC operating conditions.","","","Pacific Northwest National Lab.

All distributions were observed to be nearly isotropic, but non-random textures above the detection threshold were observed. The distributions differ between the two cells, as do the phase fractions and the electrochemical history. The different distributions are interpreted as evidence that steady-state distributions vary locally with phase fractions or that they evolve during the initial operation of the fuel cell. The rates at which triple lines, pore surfaces, and interface boundaries in the porous mixture approach a steady-state value appear to decrease with the average amount of mass transport required to reorient that specific feature.

In this communication, we demonstrate how interactions of Pt with a transition metal support affect not only, as commonly intended, the catalytic activity, but also the reactivity of Pt towards oxide formation or dissolution. We use two well-defined single-crystal model systems, Pt/Rh(111) and Pt/Au(111) and a unique x-ray spectroscopy technique with enhanced energy resolution to monitor the potential-dependent oxidation state of Pt, and find two markedly different oxidation mechanisms on the two different substrates. This information can be of great significance for future design of more active and more stable catalysts. We have studied the potential-induced degradation of Pt monolayer model electrocatalysts on Rh(111) and Au(111) single-crystal substrates. The anodic formation of Pt oxides was monitored using in situ high energy resolution fluorescence detection x-ray absorption spectroscopy (HERFD XAS). Although Pt was deposited on both substrates in a three-dimensional island growth mode, we observed remarkable differences during oxide formation that can only be understood in terms of strong Pt-substrate interactions throughout the Pt islands. Anodic polarization of Pt/Rh(111) up to +1.6 V vs. RHE (reversible hydrogen electrode) leads to formation an incompletely oxidized passive layer, whereas formation of PtO2 and partial Pt dissolution is observed for Pt/Au(111).","","http://www.slac.stanford.edu/cgi-wrap/pubpage?slac-pub-14485.html","SLAC National Accelerator Lab., Menlo Park, CA (United States)","USDOE","","United States","2011-06-22T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: Submitted to Angewandte Chemie International Edition","","Medium: ED; Size: n/a","","SLAC-PUB-14485","AC02-76SF00515","Journal ID: ISSN 1433-7851; TRN: US201112%%541","10.1002/anie.201101620","","2011-07-21T00:00:00Z","1017211","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/1017211","https://www.osti.gov/servlets/purl/1017211","Submitted to Angewandte Chemie International Edition","",""

The present study aims at clarifying the role of metal components in bimetallic catalysts for oxygen-enhanced water gas shift (OWGS), wherein a small amount of O{sub 2} is added to H{sub 2}-rich reformate gas to enhance CO shift. Among CeO{sub 2}-supported bimetallic catalysts, Pd-Cu and Pt-Cu combinations were found to show strong synergetic promoting effect in OWGS, which leads to much higher CO conversion and higher H{sub 2} yield than WGS at low temperature around 250 C. Temperature programmed reduction (TPR) showed strong interaction between Pd and Cu in Pd-Cu/CeO{sub 2} by a single reduction peak in contrast to multiple peaks on monometallic Cu/CeO{sub 2}. Extended X-ray absorption fine structure (EXAFS) analysis revealed that such bimetallic Pd-Cu and Pt-Cu form alloy nanoparticles, where noble metal is mainly surrounded by Cu atoms. Oxygen storage capacity (OSC) measurements point to higher resistance of Pd-Cu to oxidation indicating that Pd keeps Cu in reduced state in air pulse condition. From kinetic study, Pd in Pd-Cu was found to promote CO shift, rather than CO oxidation by increasing the number of active sites and by suppressing H{sub 2} activation (that is inherent to monometallic Pd), which minimizes both the inhibition effect of H{sub 2} and the loss of H{sub 2} by oxidation in OWGS. Transient response technique revealed that Cu in Pd-Cu enhances desorption of strongly chemisorbed CO{sub 2} on catalyst surface in contrast to very slow CO{sub 2} desorption from surface of monometallic Pd. Thus, the excellent OWGS activity of Pd-Cu catalyst has been attributed to the complementary roles of the two metals for enhancing CO shift, which is realized by its alloy structure and the accompanying strong interaction between metal components.","","","Argonne National Lab.

The simulation models the rise of a buoyant magnetic flux bundle from a depth of 7.5 Mm in the convection zone up into the solar photosphere. The rise of the magnetic plasma in the convection zone is accompanied by predominantly horizontal expansion. Such an expansion leads to a scaling relation between the plasma density and the magnetic field strength such that B {proportional_to} rhov{sup 1/2}. The emergence of magnetic flux into the photosphere appears as a complex magnetic pattern, which results from the interaction of the rising magnetic field with the turbulent convective flows. Small-scale magnetic elements at the surface first appear, followed by their gradual coalescence into larger magnetic concentrations, which eventually results in the formation of a pair of opposite polarity spots. Although the mean flow pattern in the vicinity of the developing spots is directed radially outward, correlations between the magnetic field and velocity field fluctuations allow the spots to accumulate flux. Such correlations result from the Lorentz-force-driven, counterstreaming motion of opposite polarity fragments. The formation of the simulated AR is accompanied by transient light bridges between umbrae and umbral dots. Together with recent sunspot modeling, this work highlights the common magnetoconvective origin of umbral dots, light bridges, and penumbral filaments.","","Available from http://dx.doi.org/10.1088/0004-637X/720/1/233","","","","United States","2010-09-01T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: Astrophysical Journal; Journal Volume: 720; Journal Issue: 1; Other Information: DOI: 10.1088/0004-637X/720/1/233","","Medium: X; Size: page(s) 233-244","","","","Journal ID: ISSN 0004-637X; ASJOAB; TRN: US10Q5338056010","10.1088/0004-637X/720/1/233","","2011-08-04T00:00:00Z","21460135","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/21460135","","Astrophysical Journal","1","720"

We propose that the most probable reaction pathway is via CH{sub 3}CH{sub 2}O* on the basis of our mechanistic study: CH{sub 3}CH{sub 2}OH* {yields} CH{sub 3}CH{sub 2}O* {yields} CH{sub 2}CH{sub 2}O* {yields} CH{sub 2}CHO* {yields} CH{sub 2}CO* {yields} CHCO* {yields} CH* + CO* {yields} C* + CO*. In contrast, the contribution from the pathway via CH{sub 3}CHOH* is relatively small, CH{sub 3}CH{sub 2}OH* {yields} CH{sub 3}CHOH* {yields} CH{sub 3}CHO* {yields} CH{sub 3}CO* {yields} CH{sub 2}CO* {yields} CHCO* {yields} CH* + CO* {yields} C* + CO*. According to our calculations, one of the slow steps is the formation of the oxametallacycle CH{sub 2}CH{sub 2}O* species, which leads to the production of CHCO*, the precursor for C-C bond breaking. Finally, the decomposition of ethanol leads to the production of C and CO. Our calculations, for ethanol combustion on Rh, the major obstacle is not C-C bond cleavage, but the C contamination on Rh(1 1 1). The strong C-Rh interaction may deactivate the Rh catalyst. The formation of Rh alloys with Pt and Pd weakens the C-Rh interaction, easing the removal of C, and, as expected, in accordance with the experimental findings, facilitating ethanol combustion.","","","Brookhaven National Lab.

The membrane electrode assemblies in the reference PEFC stack use nanostructured, thin-film ternary catalysts supported on organic whiskers and a modified perfluorosulfonic acid membrane. The analyses show that the stack Pt content can be reduced by 50% and the projected high-volume manufacturing cost by &gt;45% for the stack and by 25% for the system, if the design-point system efficiency is lowered from 50% to 40%. The resulting penalties in performance are a &lt;1% reduction in the system peak efficiency; a 2-4% decrease in the system efficiency on the urban, highway, and LA92 drive cycles; and a 6.3% decrease in the fuel economy of the modeled hybrid fuel-cell vehicle on the combined cycle used by EPA for emission and fuel economy certification. The stack heat load, however, increases by 50% at full power (80 kW{sub e}) but by only 23% at the continuous power (61.5 kW{sub e}) needed to propel the vehicle on a 6.5% grade at 55 mph. The reduced platinum and system cost advantages of further lowering the design-point efficiency from 40% to 35% are marginal. The analyses indicate that thermal management in the lower efficiency systems is very challenging and that the radiator becomes bulky if the stack temperature cannot be allowed to increase to 90-95 C under driving conditions where heat rejection is difficult.","","","Argonne National Lab.

Oxide scale will inevitably grow on the ferritic interconnects in a high temperature oxidation environment of SOFCs. The growth of the oxide scale induces growth stresses in the scale layer and on the scale/substrate interface. These growth stresses combined with the thermal stresses induced upon stacking cooling by the thermal expansion coefficient mismatch between the oxide scale and the substrate may lead to scale delamination/buckling and eventual spallation, which may lead to serious cell performance degradation. Hence the interfacial adhesion strength between the oxide scale and the substrate is crucial to the reliability and durability of the metallic interconnect in SOFC operating environments. In this paper, we applied an integrated experimental/modeling methodology to quantify the interfacial adhesion strength between the oxide scale and the SS 441 metallic interconnect. The predicted interfacial strength is discussed in details.","","","Pacific Northwest National Lab.

The cell anodes were supplied mixtures of humidified hydrogen and various inert gasses. It was demonstrated that the true limiting current in flow-through cells is reached when either: the hydrogen is nearly or completely depleted at the anode-electrolyte interface near the outlet; or when the concentration of steam at that interface becomes high enough to interfere with adsorption or transport of the remaining hydrogen near the triple-phase boundaries. Choice of inert gas had no effect on limiting currents in the flow-through tests, indicating that diffusion within the porous anode had no significant effect on cell performance at high currents. In the button cells, the apparent limiting currents were significantly changed by the choice of inert gas, indicating that they were determined by diffusion through the bulk gas within the support tube. It was concluded that the apparent limiting currents measured in button cells are influenced more by parameters of the experimental setup, such as the proximity of the fuel tube outlet, than by the physical properties of the anode.","","","Pacific Northwest National Lab.

Gold 'seeds' of different aspect ratios (1 to 4.2), grown by a silver-assisted approach, were used as templates for high-yield production of novel Au-Pt nanocatalysts at a low temperature (40 C). Characterization by electron microscopy (SEM, TEM, HRTEM), energy dispersive X-ray analysis (EDX), UV-Vis spectroscopy, zeta-potential (surface charge), atomic force microscopy (AFM), X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) and inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry (ICP-MS) were used to better understand their physico-chemical properties, preferred reactivities and underlying nanoparticle growth mechanism. A rotating disk electrode was used to evaluate the Au-Pt nanocatalysts electrochemical performance in the oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) and the methanol oxidation reaction (MOR) of direct methanol fuel cells. The results indicate the Au-Pt dogbones are partially and in some cases completely unaffected by methanol poisoning during the evaluation of the ORR. The ORR performance of the octahedron particles in the absence of MeOH is superior to that of the Au-Pt dogbones and Pt-black, however its performance is affected by the presence of MeOH.","","available","Savannah River Site (SRS), Aiken, SC (United States)","USDOE","","United States","2011-04-20T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: Journal of Nanoparticle Research; Journal Volume: 13; Journal Issue: 12","","Medium: ED","","SRNL-STI-2011-00243","DE-AC09-08SR22470","Journal ID: ISSN 1388-0764; TRN: US201211%%333","","","2012-12-05T00:00:00Z","1041025","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/1041025","https://www.osti.gov/servlets/purl/1041025","Journal of Nanoparticle Research","12","13"

The present study investigates the effect of chlorinated impurities on fuel cell systems using tetrachloroethylene (PCE) as a model compound for cleaning and degreasing agents. Concentrations between 0.05 parts per million (ppm) and 30 ppm were studied. We show how PCE causes rapid drop in cell performances for all concentrations including 0.05 ppm. At concentrations of 1 and 0.05 ppm, PCE poisoned the cell at a rate dependent on the dosage of the contaminant delivered to the cell. PCE appears to affect the cell when the cell potential was over potentials higher than approximately 0.2 V. No effects were observed at voltages around or below 0.2 V and the cells could be recovered from previous poisoning performed at higher potentials. Recoveries at those low voltages could be induced by changing the operating voltage or by purging the system. Poisoning did not appear to affect the membrane conductivity.

These materials, ammonium borohydride (ABH2, [NH4][BH4]; 240 g H2/kg; 165 g/liter), ammonia borane (AB, [NH3BH3]; 196 g H2/kg; 147 g/liter) and diammoniate of diborane (DADB, [NH3BH2NH3][BH4]; 196 g H2/kg; ca. 151 g/liter), release hydrogen by a series of moderately exothermic reaction pathways. The advantage of these materials is that hydrogen release is kinetically controlled and occurs at relatively low temperatures and moderate pressures. The challenges are devising economical pathways to regenerate the fully charged hydrogen storage materials off board and understanding and controlling the formation of volatile impurities that decrease the purity of the hydrogen available for polymer electrolyte membrane fuel cell applications. The focus of this review is on the solid phase ABH2, AB and DADB materials to complement the coverage of AB in other recent review articles [1-2].

Particularly, austenite Fe-Ni-Cr is looked upon favorably in space and jet engine industry for their improved resistance to stress corrosion cracking [5]. In solid oxide fuel cells (SOFC), Ni-alloys are frequently used as interconnects and seals [6]. In this communication, simultaneous energy dispersive spectroscopy (EDS) and electron backscatter diffraction (EBSD) mapping is utilized to study chemical and structural aspects of chromium segregation in Fe-Ni-Cr alloy. A focused Ga-ion beam is also utilized to study the effect of ion beam cleaning on EBSD image quality (IQ) and inverse pole figure (IPF) maps of Fe-Ni-Cr alloy.","","","Pacific Northwest National Lab.

However as PEM fuel systems begin to approach commercial reality, there is an impending need to replace Pt with a lower cost alternative. The present study investigates the performance of a carbon-supported tantalum oxide material as a potential oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) catalyst for use on the cathode side of the PEM fuel cell membrane electrode assembly. Although bulk tantalum oxide tends to exhibit poor electrochemical performance due to limited electrical conductivity, it displays a high oxygen reduction potential; one that is comparable to Pt. Analysis of the Pourbaix electrochemical equilibrium database also indicates that tantalum oxide (Ta2O5) is chemically stable under the pH and applied potential conditions to which the cathode catalyst is typically exposed during stack operation. Nanoscale tantalum oxide catalysts were fabricated using two approaches, by reactive oxidation sputtering and by direct chemical synthesis, each carried out on a carbon support material. Nanoscale tantalum oxide particles measuring approximately 6nm in size that were sputtered onto carbon paper exhibited a mass-specific current density as high as one-third that of Pt when measured at 0.6V vs. NHE. However because of the two-dimensional nature of this particle-on-paper structure, which limits the overall length of the triple phase boundary junctions where the oxide, carbon paper, and aqueous electrolyte meet, the corresponding area-specific current density was quite low. The second synthesis approach yielded a more extended, three-dimensional structure via chemical deposition of nanoscale tantalum oxide particles on carbon powder. These catalysts exhibited a high ORR onset potential, comparable to that of Pt, and displayed a significant improvement in the area-specific current density. Overall, the highest mass-specific current density of the carbon-powder supported catalyst was ~ 9% of that of Pt.","","","Pacific Northwest National Lab.

We systematically investigated these properties as a function of the hydration level. The changes in nanostructure, in transport dynamics of water and hydronium ions, and in water network percolation were extracted from MD simulations and compared with Nafion. Phosphonic and phosphinic acid moieties in FPA and FPA-I, have lower acidity than sulfonic acid in Nafion, yet the diffusion of water was observed to be faster in FPA and FPA-I than in Nafion, particularly at low hydration levels. However this did not give rise to notable differences in hydronium ion diffusion and water network percolation for these membranes over Nafion. Similar observations were also reported by our group recently in a study of perfluoro-sulfonyl imide membranes carrying stronger super-acids than sulfonic acid of Nafion. These findings together suggest no strong apparent correlation between the acidity strength of the functional acid groups and the dynamics of water and hydronium ions in hydrated polymer electrolyte membranes (PEMs) with similar fluorocarbon backbones and acidic group-carrying side chains.

"Plasma Nitrided Type 349 Stainless Steel for Polymer Electrolyte Membrane Fuel Cell Bipolar Plate—Part I: Nitrided in Nitrogen Plasma","Wang, Heli; Teeter, Glenn; Turner, John A.","30 DIRECT ENERGY CONVERSION; plasma nitridation; bipolar plate; PEMFC; stainless steel; corrosion","<p>An austenite 349 stainless steel was nitrided via nitrogen plasma. Glancing angle X-ray diffraction patterns suggest that the nitrided layer is amorphous. X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy analysis indicated that the plasma nitridation process produced bulk-type nitrides in the surface layer. In general, the nitrided layer was composed of iron oxide in the outer layer and chromium oxide in the inner layers. Contaminations of vanadium and tin were detected in the as-grown nitrided layer; these dissolved away after polarization. The influence of these contaminants on the corrosion resistance of the nitrided layer in polymer electrolyte membrane fuel cell (PEMFC) environments is not considered significant. The nitrided sample had a much higher contact resistance than the bare one and the contact resistance increased with the nitriding time. The high interfacial contact resistance values can be related to the thicker oxide film after plasma nitridation. The corrosion resistances obtained for the 1 h nitrided and bare stainless steels in simulated PEMFC environments were similar. The outmost nitrided layer dissolved after polarization in the PEMFC environments leaving a passive film (modified with nitrides), similar to that of bare stainless steel under the same conditions. The passive film thickness was 3.7 nm for nitrided steel in PEMFC cathode environment and 4.2 nm for nitrided steel in PEMFC anode environment.</p>","ASME","","National Renewable Energy Lab.

However, volatile Cr-containing species originating from this scale poison the cathode material in the cells and subsequently cause power degradation in the devices. To prevent this, a conductive manganese cobaltite coating has been developed. However, this coating is not compatible with forming hermetic seals between the interconnect or window frame component and ceramic cell. This coating reacts with sealing materials. Thus, a new aluminizing process has been developed for the sealing regions in these parts, as well as for other metallic stack and balance-of-plant components. From this development, the sealing performance and SOFC stack performance became very stable.","","","Pacific Northwest National Lab.

Our research on functional models of hydrogenase enzymes uses nickel and cobalt, abundant and inexpensive metals, in contrast to platinum, a precious metal used in fuel cells. A key feature of our research is a focus on the use of pendant amines incorporated into diphosphine ligands. These pendant amines function as proton relays, lowering the barrier to proton transfers to and from the catalytically active metal site. The hydride acceptor ability of metal cations, along with the basicity of pendant amines, are key thermochemical values that determine the thermodynamics of addition of H2 to a metal complex with a pendant amine incorporated into its ligand. Nickel catalysts for oxidation of H2 have turnover frequencies up to 50 s-1 (at 1 atm H2 and room temperature). Nickel and cobalt catalysts for production of H2 by reduction of protons are studied, one of which has a turnover frequency over 1000 s-1.

The glass containing ~17 mole% alkalis (K2O and Na2O) remains vitreous and compliant during SOFC operation, unlike conventional SOFC sealing glasses, which experience substantial devitrification after the sealing process. The non-crystallizing compliant sealing glass has lower glass transition and softening temperatures since the microstructure remains glassy without significant crystallite formation, and hence can relieve or reduce residual stresses and also has the potential for crack healing. Sealing approaches based on compliant glass will also need to satisfy all the mechanical, thermal, chemical, physical, and electrical requirements for SOFC applications, not only in bulk properties but also at sealing interfaces. In this first of a series of papers we will report the thermal cycle stability of the glass when sealed between two SOFC components, i.e., a NiO/YSZ anode supported YSZ bilayer and a coated ferritic stainless steel interconnect material. High temperature leak rates were monitored versus thermal cycles between 700-850oC using back pressures ranging from 0.2 psi to 1.0 psi. Isothermal stability was also evaluated in a dual environment consisting of flowing dilute H2 fuel versus ambient air. In addition, chemical compatibility at the alumina and YSZ interfaces was examined with scanning electron microscopy and energy dispersive spectroscopy. The results shed new light on the topic of SOFC glass seal development.","","","Pacific Northwest National Lab.

Prior to operating on fuel gas containing low concentrations of H2S, the nickel/zirconia anodes were briefly exposed to antimony or tin vapor, which only slightly affected the SOFC performance. During the subsequent exposures to 1 and 5 ppm H2S, increases in anodic polarization losses were minimal compared to those observed for the standard nickel/zirconia anodes. Post-test XPS analyses showed that Sb and Sn tended to segregate to the surface of Ni particles, and further confirmed a significant reduction of adsorbed sulfur on the Ni surface in Ni/Sn and Ni/Sb samples compared to the Ni. The effect may be the result of weaker sulfur adsorption on bimetallic surfaces, adsorption site competition between sulfur and Sb or Sn on Ni, or other factors. The use of dilute binary alloys of Ni-Sb or Ni-Sn in the place of Ni, or brief exposure to Sb or Sn vapor, may be effective means to counteract the effects of sulfur poisoning in SOFC anodes and Ni catalysts. Other advantages, including suppression of coking or tailoring the anode composition for the internal reforming, are also expected.","","","Pacific Northwest National Lab.

Tests with both anode-supported and electrolyte-supported button cells were performed at 700 and 800oC in synthetic coal gas containing 10 ppb to 9 ppm antimony. Minor performance loss was observed immediately after Sb introduction to coal gas resulting in ca. 5 % power output drop. While no further degradation was observed during the following several hundred hours of testing, cells abruptly and irreversibly failed after 800-1500 hours depending on Sb concentration and test temperature. Antimony was found to interact strongly with nickel and result in extensive alteration phase formation, consistent with expectations based on thermodynamic properties. Nickel antimonide phases, NiSb and Ni5Sb2, were partially coalesced into large grains and eventually affected electronic percolation through the anode support. Initial degradation was attributed to diffusion of antimony to the active anode/electrolyte interface to form an adsorption layer.","","","Pacific Northwest National Lab.

With this growth has come the need to spread the word about safe practices for handling, storing, and using hydrogen. Like all energy forms, hydrogen can be used safely through proper procedures and engineering techniques. However, hydrogen involves a degree of risk that must be respected, and the importance of avoiding complacency or haste in the safe conduct and performance of projects involving hydrogen cannot be overstated. To encourage and promote the safe use of hydrogen, Pacific Northwest National Laboratory (PNNL) has developed and continues to enhance two software tools in support of the U.S. Department of Energy's Fuel Cell Technologies Program: the Hydrogen Safety Best Practices online manual (www.H2BestPractices.org) and the Hydrogen Incident Reporting and Lessons Learned database (www.H2Incidents.org).","","","Pacific Northwest National Lab.

In addition to electrochemical performance, structural integrity of the SOFC anode is essential for successful long-term operation. The SOFC anode is subjected to stresses at high temperature, thermal/redox cycles, and fuel gas contaminants effects during long-term operation. These mechanisms can alter the anode microstructure and affect its electrochemical and structural properties. In this research, anode material degradation mechanisms are briefly reviewed and an anode material durability model is developed and implemented in finite element analysis. The model takes into account thermo-mechanical and fuel gas contaminants degradation mechanisms for prediction of long-term structural integrity of the SOFC anode. The proposed model is validated experimentally using a NexTech ProbostatTM SOFC button cell test apparatus integrated with a Sagnac optical setup for simultaneously measuring electrochemical performance and in-situ anode surface deformation.","","","Pacific Northwest National Lab.

The first level of response was characterized by a rapid but modest decrease in power density to a new steady state, with no further degradation observed in tests up to 700 hours in duration. Mostly observed at high temperatures, low H2Se concentrations, and low anodic polarizations, this response level was similar to effects caused by the presence of H2S, but with slower onset and lower reversibility. Higher anodic polarization at a constant current could trigger a second level of response characterized by oscillatory behavior involving cycles of rapid performance loss followed by rapid recovery. Oscillations at the constant current density were accompanied by the appearance and disappearance of a new feature in the electrochemical impedance spectrum with a summit frequency of ~100 Hz. Oscillatory behavior ceased when the current density was lowered. Such behavior was not observed for cells operated at a constant potential of similar magnitude, though. A third level of response, irreversible cell failure, could be induced by further increases in anodic polarization, additionally favored by low temperature and high H2Se concentration. Post-test analyses of failed cells by electron microscopy revealed the extensive microstructural changes including the appearance of nickel oxide and nickel selenide alteration phases, only at the anode/electrolyte interface. From bulk thermochemical considerations the formation of nickel selenides could not be expected. Local chemical conditions created at the anode/electrolyte interface appear to be of overriding importance with respect to the extent of Ni/YSZ anode interactions with H2Se in coal gas.","","","Pacific Northwest National Lab.

The differential electrochemical effects at each electrode and the resultant full-cell performance were analyzed in medium pH from 6.0 to 8.0. Potentials changed -60 mV/pH for the anode and -68 mV/pH for the cathode, coincident with thermodynamic estimations. Open circuit voltage reached a maximum (741 mV) at pH 7, and maximum power density was highest (712 mW/m{sup 2}) at pH 6.5 as the cathode performance improved at lower pH. Maximum current density increased and apparent half-saturation potential (E{sub KA}) decreased with increasing medium pH due to improved anode performance. An equivalent circuit model composed of two time constant processes accurately fit bioanode impedance data. One of these processes was consistently the rate-limiting step for acetate-oxidizing exoelectrogenesis, with its pH-varying charge transfer resistance R{sub 2} ranging from 2- to 321-fold higher than the pH-independent charge transfer resistance R{sub 1}. The associated capacitance C{sub 2} was 2-3 orders of magnitude larger than C{sub 1}. R{sub 2} was lowest near E{sub KA} and increased by several orders of magnitude at anode potentials above E{sub KA}, while R{sub 1} was nearly stable. However, fits deviated slightly at potentials above E{sub KA} due to emerging impedance possibly associated with diffusion and excessive potential.","","","Oak Ridge National Lab.

This study compares reduction potentials that might be achieved in 2060 for several advanced options including biofuels, hybrid electric vehicles (HEV), plug-in hybrid electric vehicles (PHEV), and fuel cell electric vehicles (FCEV), assuming that technical and cost reduction targets are met and necessary fueling infrastructures are built. The study quantifies the extent of the reductions that can be achieved through increasing engine efficiency and transitioning to low-carbon fuels separately. Decarbonizing the fuels is essential for achieving large reductions in GHG emissions, and the study quantifies the reductions that can be achieved over a range of fuel carbon intensities. Although renewables will play a vital role, some combination of coal gasification with carbon capture and sequestration, and/or nuclear energy will likely be needed to enable very large reductions in carbon intensities for hydrogen and electricity. Biomass supply constraints do not allow major carbon emission reductions from biofuels alone; the value of biomass is that it can be combined with other solutions to help achieve significant results. Compared with gasoline, natural gas provides 20% reduction in GHG emissions in internal combustion engines and up to 50% reduction when used as a feedstock for producing hydrogen or electricity, making it a good transition fuel for electric propulsion drive trains. The material in this paper can be useful information to many other countries, including developing countries because of a common factor: the difficulty of finding sustainable, low-carbon, cost-competitive substitutes for petroleum fuels.","","","Oak Ridge National Lab.

Water loss was observed in situ via neutron imaging for varying experimental conditions, including flow rates of hydrogen and air, cathode inlet humidity, volume of enzyme solution, and its composition. Cathode water loss occurred for all experimental conditions, but the loss rate was noticeably reduced when a high-salt-concentration enzyme solution was used in the cathode in conjunction with increased humidity in the air feed stream. Results from neutron imaging and power density analysis were used in analyzing the causes that could contribute to EFC water loss. An increase in temperature due to the exothermic cathode reaction is considered a plausible cause of cathode water loss via evaporation. This is the first reported application of neutron imaging as a technique to study EFC water management. The results suggest that neutron imaging can be employed to provide a better understanding of EFC phenomena and thereby contribute to design and operational improvements of EFCs.","","","Oak Ridge National Lab.

The salient feature of the presented reconstruction methodology is the ability to realize the 3D microstructure from its 2D SEM image for a three-phase medium extendable to n-phase media. In the realization procedure, different phases of the heterogeneous medium are represented by different cells which are allowed to grow. The growth of cells, however, are controlled via several optimization parameters related to rotation, shrinkage, translation, distribution and growth rates of the cells. Indeed, the proposed realization algorithm can be categorized as a member of dynamic programming methods and is designed so comprehensive that can realize any desired microstructure. To be more specific, at first the initial 2D image is successfully reconstructed and then the final optimization parameters are used as the initial values for the initiation of the 3D reconstruction algorithm. This paper presents a novel hybrid stochastic methodology based on the colony and kinetic algorithm for the simulation of the virtual microstructure. The simulation procedure involves repeated realizations where each realization in turn consists of nucleation and growth of cells. For each of the subsequent realizations, the controlling parameters get updated by minimization of an objective function at the end of the preceding realization. Here, the objective function is defined based on the two-point correlation functions from the simulated and real microstructures. The kinetic growth algorithm is established on the cellular automata approach which facilitates the simulation procedure. Comparison of the two-point correlation functions from different sections of the final 3D reconstructed microstructure with the initial real microstructure shows a satisfactory agreement which confirms the proposed methodology.","","","Pacific Northwest National Lab.

Variation of the synthesis steps, heat-treatment temperature, metal loading, and the metal type in the synthesis leads to markedly different catalyst activity, speciation, and morphology. Microscopy studies demonstrate notable differences in the carbon structure as a function of these variables. Balancing the need to increase the catalyst's degree of graphitization through heat treatment versus the excessive loss of surface area that occurs at higher temperatures is a key to preparing an active catalyst. XPS and XAFS spectra are consistent with the presence of Me-N{sub x} structures in both the Co and Fe versions of the catalyst, which are often proposed to be active sites. The average speciation and coordination environment of nitrogen and metal, however, depends greatly on the choice of Co or Fe. Taken together, the data indicate that better control of the metal-catalyzed transformations of the polymer into new graphitized carbon forms in the heat-treatment step will allow for even further improvement of this class of catalysts.","","","Oak Ridge National Lab.

Volatile chromium species are known to migrate from the current collector of the SOFC into the cathode where over time they decrease the voltage output of the fuel cell. A pore scale model is used to investigate the reactive transport of chromium species in the cathode and to study the driving forces of chromium poisoning. A multi-scale modeling approach is proposed which uses a cell level model of the cathode, air channel and current collector to determine the boundary conditions for a pore scale model of a section of the cathode. The pore scale model uses a discrete representation of the cathode to explicitly model the surface reactions of oxygen and chromium with a cathode material. The pore scale model is used to study the reaction mechanisms of chromium by considering the effects of reaction rates, diffusion coefficients, chromium vaporization, and oxygen consumption on chromium’s deposition in the cathode. The study shows that chromium poisoning is most significantly affected by the chromium reaction rates in the cathode and that the reaction rates are a function of the local current density in the cathode.","","","Pacific Northwest National Lab.

For this purpose an experimental investigation of thermoelectrics in contact with clean and fouled heat exchangers of different materials is performed. The thermoelectric devices are tested on a bench-scale thermoelectric heat recovery apparatus that simulates automotive exhaust. The thermoelectric apparatus consists of a series of thermoelectric generators contacting a hot-side and a cold-side heat exchanger. The thermoelectric devices are tested with two different hot-side heat exchanger materials, stainless steel and aluminum, and at a range of simulated exhaust gas flowrates (40 to 150 slpm), exhaust gas temperatures (240 C and 280 C), and coolant-side temperatures (40 C and 80 C). It is observed that for higher exhaust gas flowrates, thermoelectric power output increases while overall system efficiency decreases. Degradation of the effectiveness of the EGR-type heat exchangers over a period of driving is also simulated by exposing the heat exchangers to diesel engine exhaust under thermophoretic conditions to form a deposit layer. For the fouled EGR-type heat exchangers, power output and system efficiency is observed to be significantly lower for all conditions tested. The study found, however, that heat exchanger material is the dominant factor in the ability of the system to convert heat to electricity with thermoelectric generators. This finding is thought to be unique to the heat exchangers used for this study, and not a universal trend for all system configurations.","","","Oak Ridge National Lab.

Despite the well-recognized role of oxygen reaction kinetics on the viability of energy technologies, the governing mechanisms remain elusive and until now addressable only by macroscopic studies. This lack of nanoscale understanding precludes optimization of material architecture. Here we report direct measurements of oxygen reduction/evolution reactions and oxygen vacancy diffusion on oxygen-ion conductive solid surfaces with sub-10 nanometer resolution. In electrochemical strain microscopy (ESM), the biased scanning probe microscopy tip acts as a moving, electrocatalytically active probe exploring local electrochemical activity. The probe concentrates an electric field in a nanometer-scale volume of material, and bias-induced, picometer-level surface displacements provide information on local electrochemical processes. Systematic mapping of oxygen activity on bare and Pt-functionalized yttria-stabilized zirconia (YSZ) surfaces is demonstrated. This approach allows directly visualization of ORR/OER activation process at the triple-phase boundary, and can be extended to broad spectrum of oxygen-conductive and electrocatalytic materials.","","","Oak Ridge National Lab.

Systematic studies of alloy catalysts are, however, often compromised by inhomogeneous distribution of alloying components. Here we introduce a general approach for the synthesis of monodispersed and highly homogeneous Pt-bimetallic alloy nanocatalysts. Pt{sub 3}M (where M = Fe, Ni, or Co) nanoparticles were prepared by an organic solvothermal method and then supported on high surface area carbon. These catalysts attained a homogeneous distribution of elements, as demonstrated by atomic-scale elemental analysis using scanning transmission electron microscopy. They also exhibited high catalytic activities for the oxygen reduction reaction (ORR), with improvement factors of 2-3 versus conventional Pt/carbon catalysts. The measured ORR catalytic activities for Pt{sub 3}M nanocatalysts validated the volcano curve established on extended surfaces, with Pt{sub 3}Co being the most active alloy.","","","Argonne National Lab.

The exact method and equations for modeling this layer are still being revised and will be discussed in this paper, including a 0.8 reaction order, existence of Pt oxides, possible non-isopotential agglomerates, and the impact of a film resistance towards oxygen transport. While the former assumptions are relatively straightforward to understand and implement, the latter film resistance is shown to be critically important in explaining increased mass-transport limitations with low Pt-loading catalyst layers. Model results demonstrate agreement with experimental data that the increased oxygen flux and/or diffusion pathway through the film can substantially decrease performance. Also, some scale-up concepts from the agglomerate scale to the more macroscopic porous-electrode scale are discussed and the resulting optimization scenarios investigated.","The Electrochemical Society","","Lawrence Berkeley National Lab.

Using a combination of core-level X-ray photoemission spectroscopy (XPS), X-ray emission/absorption spectroscopy (XES/XAS), resonant inelastic X-ray scattering (RIXS) and resonant photoemission spectroscopy (RPES), we have monitored the evolution of these properties in LSMO at various stages of fabrication and operation. By rapidly quenching and sealing in vacuum, we were able to directly compare the pristine (as-fabricated) LSMO with both ""heat-treated"" (800°C in air, and no bias) and ""burnt-in"" (800°C in air, -1 V bias) LSMO cathodes i.e. before and after the activation observed in our electrochemical impendence spectroscopy measurements. Comparison between the O K-edge XAS/XES and Mn L3,2-edge XAS of pristine and “burnt-in” LSMO cathodes revealed a severe change in the oxygen environment along with a reduced Mn2+ presence near the surface following activation. The change in the oxygen environment is attributed to SrxMnyOz formation, along with possible passive SrO and Mn3O4 species. We present evidence from our “heat-treated” samples that SrxMnyOz regions form at elevated temperatures in air before the application of a cathodic bias. Our core-level XPS, Mn L3,2-edge RIXS and Mn L3 RPES studies of “heat-treated” and pristine LSMO determined that SOFC environments result in La-deficiency (severest near the surface) and stronger Mn4+ contribution, leading to the increased insulating character of the cathode prior to activation. The passive Mn2+ species near the surface and increased hole-doping (>0.6) of the LSMO upon exposure to the operating environment are considered responsible for the initially poor performance of the SOFC. Meanwhile, the improved oxygen reduction following the application of a cathodic bias is considered to be due to enhanced bulk oxygen-ion diffusion resulting from the migration of Mn2+ ions towards the LSMO/electrolyte interface and the SrxMnyOz regions facilitating enhanced bulk oxygen reduction reaction kinetics.","","","Pacific Northwest National Lab.

The methods used to improve catalytic activity are diverse, ranging from the alloying and de-alloying of platinum to the synthesis of platinum core-shell catalysts. However, methods to improve the stability of the carbon supports and catalyst nanoparticles are limited, especially during shutdown (when hydrogen is purged from the anode by air) and startup (when air is purged from the anode by hydrogen) conditions when the cathode potential can be pushed up to 1.5 V. Under the latter conditions, stability of the cathode materials is strongly affected (carbon oxidation reaction) by the undesired oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) on the anode side. This emphasizes the importance of designing selective anode catalysts that can efficiently suppress the ORR while fully preserving the Pt-like activity for the hydrogen oxidation reaction. Here, we demonstrate that chemically modified platinum with a self-assembled monolayer of calix[4]arene molecules meets this challenging requirement.","","","Argonne National Lab.

A theoretical understanding and screening the metal-oxide composite catalysts for the water-gas shift (WGS) reaction is presented here. Density functional theory was employed to identify the key step for the WGS reaction on the Au, Cu-oxide catalysts, where the calculated reaction energy for water dissociation correlates well with the experimental measured WGS activity. Accordingly, the calculated reaction energy for water dissociation was used as the scaling descriptor to screen the inverse model catalysts, oxide/Cu(111), for the better WGS activity. Our calculations predict that the WGS activity increases in a sequence: Cu(111), ZnO/Cu(111) &lt; TiO{sub 2}/Cu(111), ZrO{sub 2}/Cu(111) &lt; MoO{sub 3}/Cu(111). Our results imply that the high performances of Au, Cu-oxide nanocatalysts in the WGS reaction rely heavily on the direct participation of both oxide and metal sites. The degree that the oxide is reduced by Cu plays an important role in determining the WGS activity of oxide/Cu catalysts. The reducible oxide can be transformed from the fully oxidized form to the reduced form due to the interaction with Cu and, therefore, the transfer of electron density from Cu, which helps in releasing the bottleneck water dissociation and, therefore, facilitating the WGS reaction on copper.","","","Brookhaven National Lab.

We consider that the palladium interlayer plays an essential role in achieving high catalytic activity by adjusting the electronic interaction of the platinum monolayer with the IrCo core, so that it accelerates the kinetics of adsorption and desorption of the intermediates of oxygen reduction. A similar trend was observed for Pt{sub ML}/Pd{sub ML} and Pt{sub ML} deposited on Ir{sub 3}Co/C alloy core. We used density functional theory to interpret the observed phenomena.","","","Brookhaven National Lab. (BNL), Upton, NY (United States).

It is estimated that at least 20 terawatts of carbon-free energy (1 and 1/2 times the total amount of all forms of energy consumed today globally), in the form of electricity and liquid and gaseous fuels, will be required by 2050 in order to avoid the most serious consequences of global climate change and to ensure adequate global energy supply that will avoid economic chaos. But in order for solar energy to contribute a major fraction of future carbon-free energy supplies, it must be priced competitively with, or perhaps even be less costly than, energy from fossil fuels and nuclear power as well as other renewable energy resources. The challenge of delivering very low-cost solar fuels and electricity will require groundbreaking advances in both fundamental and applied science. This Thematic Issue on Solar Photon Conversion will provide a review by leading researchers on the present status and prognosis of the science and technology of direct solar photoconversion to electricity and fuels. The topics covered include advanced and novel concepts for low-cost photovoltaic (PV) energy based on chemistry (dye-sensitized photoelectrodes, organic and molecular PV, multiple exciton generation in quantum dots, singlet fission), solar water splitting, redox catalysis for water oxidation and reduction, the role of nanoscience and nanocrystals in solar photoconversion, photoelectrochemical energy conversion, and photoinduced electron transfer. The direct conversion of solar photons to electricity via photovoltaic (PV) cells is a vital present-day commercial industry, with PV module production growing at about 75%/year over the past 3 years. However, the total installed yearly averaged energy capacity at the end of 2009 was about 7 GW-year (0.2% of global electricity usage). Thus, there is potential for the PV industry to grow enormously in the future (by factors of 100-300) in order for it to provide a significant fraction of total global electricity needs (currently about 3.5 TW). Such growth will be greatly facilitated by, and probably even require, major advances in the conversion efficiency and cost reduction for PV cells and modules; such advances will depend upon advances in PV science and technology, and these approaches are discussed in this Thematic Issue. Industrial and domestic electricity utilization accounts for only about 30% of the total energy consumed globally. Most ({approx}70%) of our energy consumption is in the form of liquid and gaseous fuels. Presently, solar-derived fuels are produced from biomass (labeled as biofuels) and are generated through biological photosynthesis. The global production of liquid biofuels in 2009 was about 1.6 million barrels/day, equivalent to a yearly output of about 2.5 EJ (about 1.3% of global liquid fuel utilization). The direct conversion of solar photons to fuels produces high-energy chemical products that are labeled as solar fuels; these can be produced through nonbiological approaches, generally called artificial photosynthesis. The feedstocks for artificial photosynthesis are H{sub 2}O and CO{sub 2}, either reacting as coupled oxidation-reduction reactions, as in biological photosynthesis, or by first splitting H{sub 2}O into H{sub 2} and O{sub 2} and then reacting the solar H{sub 2} with CO{sub 2} (or CO produced from CO2) in a second step to produce fuels through various well-known chemical routes involving syngas, water gas shift, and alcohol synthesis; in some applications, the generated solar H{sub 2} itself can be used as an excellent gaseous fuel, for example, in fuel cells. But at the present time, there is no solar fuels industry. Much research and development are required to create a solar fuels industry, and this Thematic Issue presents several reviews on the relevant solar fuels science and technology. The first three manuscripts relate to the daunting problem of producing solar fuels. Lewis and colleagues present a comprehensive review of solar water splitting based on semiconductor electrodes. The semiconductor electrodes are either in direct contact with an aqueous electrolyte, creating a semiconductor-liquid junction, in which case this defines a true photoelectrochemical (PEC) configuration, or the semiconductors can form buried p-n junctions connected to metal anodes and/or cathodes, in which case various combination of PV and PEC cell configurations are possible. The issues of cell energetics, cell efficiency, photocorrosion, and electrocatalysis are discussed in detail. Nocera et al. first discuss the global energy problem and review the issues and technologies for solar energy storage. Then they focus on solar fuels as the best option for solar energy storage at sufficient scale to solve the looming energy crisis.","","","Brookhaven National Lab.

Our results show that at low hydration levels H2O molecules are isolated and a continuous hydrogen-bonded network forms as the hydration level is increased. Our quantitative analysis has established a hydration level (λ) between 5 and 6 H2O/SO3- as the percolation threshold of Nafion. We have also examined the effect of such a network on proton transport by studying the structural diffusion of protons using the quantum hopping molecular dynamics method. The mean residence time of the proton on a water molecule decreases by two orders of magnitude when the λ value is increased from 5 to 15. The proton diffusion coefficient in Nafion at a λ value of 15 is about 1.1x10-5 cm2/s in agreement with experiment. The results provide quantitative atomic-level evidence of water network percolation in Nafion and its effect on proton conductivity.","","","Pacific Northwest National Lab.

Conflicting results have been published as to the magnetic properties of this mineral, with Moessbauer spectroscopy indicating no magnetic ordering down to 4.2 K but density functional theory (DFT) predicting an antiferromagnetic ground state, similar to the Fe-based high-temperature superconductors with which it is isostructural and for which it is known that magnetism is suppressed by strong itinerant spin fluctuations. We investigated this latter possibility for mackinawite using photoemission spectroscopy, near-edge x-ray absorption fine structure spectroscopy, and DFT computations. Our Fe 3{sub s} core-level photoemission spectrum of mackinawite showed a clear exchange-energy splitting (2.9 eV) consistent with a 1 {micro}{sub B} magnetic moment on the Fe ions, while the Fe L-edge x-ray absorption spectrum indicated rather delocalized Fe 3{sub d} electrons in mackinawite similar to those in Fe metal. Our DFT computations demonstrated that the ground state of mackinawite is single-stripe antiferromagnetic, with an Fe magnetic moment (2.7 {micro}{sub B}) that is significantly larger than the experimental estimate and has a strong dependence on the S height and lattice parameters. All of these trends signal the existence of strong itinerant spin fluctuations. If spin fluctuations prove to be mediators of electron pairing, we conjecture that mackinawite may be one of the simplest Fe-based superconductors.","","","Lawrence Berkeley National Lab.

Iridium is introduced into the Pd substrate in order to fine-tune the Pt-Pd interactions and to improve Pd stability under operating conditions of the fuel cell. The kinetics of the oxygen reduction reaction shows enhancement with the Pt monolayer on the PdIr nanoparticle surfaces in comparison with the reaction on Pt/C and Pt monolayer on Pd/C nanoparticles. The electrochemical measurements suggest that reduced oxidation of Pt monolayer on PdIr/C compared to Pt/C and Pt monolayer on Pd/C is the cause of enhanced activity. Besides a ligand effect induced to the Pt surface by the presence of PdIr in the second sublayer of the nanoparticle, as suggested by our density functional theory analysis, Ir also leads to a Pd skin contraction, so the Pt monolayer on PdIr/C is compressed more than on Pd/C. Both effects lead to further weakening of the Pt-OH interaction, thus increasing the ORR activity. The Pt-specific activity for Pt{sub ML}PdIr/C is three times and 25% higher than that of Pt/C and Pt{sub ML}Pd/C respectively; the Pt-mass activity of Pt{sub ML}PdIr/C is more than 20 times and 25% higher than that of Pt/C and Pt{sub ML}Pd/C, respectively.","","","Brookhaven National Lab.

Our particle-gas hybrid scheme is based on a second-order predictor-corrector method. Careful treatment of the momentum feedback on the gas guarantees exact conservation. The hybrid scheme is stable and convergent in most regimes relevant to PPDs. We describe a semi-implicit integrator generalized from the leap-frog approach. In the absence of drag force, it preserves the geometric properties of a particle orbit. We also present a fully implicit integrator that is unconditionally stable for all regimes of particle-gas coupling. Using our hybrid code, we study the numerical convergence of the nonlinear saturated state of the streaming instability. We find that gas flow properties are well converged with modest grid resolution (128 cells per pressure length {eta}r for dimensionless stopping time {tau} {sub s} = 0.1) and an equal number of particles and grid cells. On the other hand, particle clumping properties converge only at higher resolutions, and finer resolution leads to stronger clumping before convergence is reached. Finally, we find that the measurement of particle transport properties resulted from the streaming instability may be subject to error of about {+-}20%.","","Available from http://dx.doi.org/10.1088/0067-0049/190/2/297","","","","United States","2010-10-15T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: Astrophysical Journal, Supplement Series; Journal Volume: 190; Journal Issue: 2; Other Information: DOI: 10.1088/0067-0049/190/2/297","","Medium: X; Size: page(s) 297-310","","","","Journal ID: ISSN 0067-0049; APJSA2; TRN: US10Q2958049405","10.1088/0067-0049/190/2/297","","2011-07-18T00:00:00Z","21454943","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/21454943","","Astrophysical Journal, Supplement Series","2","190"

Performance losses increased with the concentration of HCl to ~100 ppm, above which losses were insensitive to HCl concentration. Cell voltage had no effect on poisoning. No evidence was found for long-term degradation that can be attributed to HCl exposure. Similarly, no evidence of microstructural changes or formation of new solid phases as a result of HCl exposure was found. From thermodynamic calculations, solid nickel chloride phase formation was shown to be highly unlikely in coal gas.

This approach is based on molecular patterning of platinum surfaces with cyanide adsorbates that can efficiently block the sites for adsorption of spectator anions while the oxygen reduction reaction proceeds unhindered. We also demonstrate that, depending on the supporting electrolyte anions and cations, on the same CN-covered Pt(111) surface, the oxygen reduction reaction activities can range from a 25-fold increase to a 50-fold decrease.

The initial membrane water content (?, the number of water molecules per sulfonic acid site) is found to be an important parameter that determines whether a successful unassisted self-start is possible. For a given initial subfreezing temperature at startup, there is a critical ? (?h), above which self-start is not possible because the product water completely engulfs the catalyst layers with ice before the stack can warm-up to 0 C. There is a second value of ? (?l), below which the stack can be self-started without forming ice. Between ?l and ?h, the stack can be self-started, but with intermediate formation of ice that melts as the stack warms up to 0 C. Both ?l and ?h are functions of the initial stack temperature, cell voltage at startup, membrane thickness, catalyst loading, and stack heat capacity. If the stack is purged during the previous shutdown by flowing air in the cathode passages, then depending on the initial amount of water in the membrane and gas diffusion layers and the initial stack temperature, it may not be possible to dry the membrane to the critical ? for a subsequent successful startup. There is an optimum ? for robust and rapid startup and shutdown. Startup and shutdown time and energy may be unacceptable if the ? is much less than the optimum. Conversely, a robust startup from subfreezing temperatures cannot be assured if the ? is much higher than this optimum.","","","Argonne National Lab.

In the current study, we use methanol as a probe molecule to demonstrate the possibility to control the decomposition pathways by supporting monolayer coverage of Pt on a tungsten monocarbide (WC) surface. Density functional theory (DFT) results reveal that on the WC and Pt/WC surfaces CH{sub 3}OH decomposes via O-H bond scission to form the methoxy (*CH{sub 3} O) intermediate. The subsequent decomposition of methoxy on the WC surface occurs through the C-O bond scission to form *CH{sub 3}, which reacts with surface *H to produce CH{sub 4}. In contrast, the decomposition of methoxy on the Pt/WC surface favors the C-H bond scission to produce *CH{sub 2} O, which prevents the formation of the *CH{sub 3} species and leads to the formation of a *CO intermediate through subsequent deprotonation steps. The DFT predictions are validated using temperature programmed desorption to quantify the gas-phase product yields and high resolution electron energy loss spectroscopy to determine the surface intermediates from methanol decomposition on Pt, WC, and Pt/WC surfaces.","","","Brookhaven National Lab.

The primary concern regarding the use of boron containing sealing glasses is the volatility of boron species, which possibly results in cathode degradation. In this paper, we report the role of volatile boron species on the electrochemical performance of LSM/YSZ and LSCF cathodes at various SOFC operation temperatures. The transport rate of boron, ~ 3.24×10-12 g/cm2•sec was measured at 750°C with air saturated with 2.8% moisture. A reduction in power density was observed in cells with LSM/YSZ cathodes after introduction of the boron source to the cathode air stream. Partial recovery of the power density was observed after the boron source was removed. Results from post-test secondary ion mass spectroscopy (SIMS) analysis the partial recovery in power density correlated with partil removal of the deposited boron by the clean air stream. The presence of boron was also observed in LSCF cathodes by SIMS analysis, however the effect of boron on the electrochemical performance of LSCF cathode was negligible. Coverage of triple phase boundaries in LSM/YSZ was postulated as the cause for the observed reduction in electrochemical performance.","","","Pacific Northwest National Lab.

"LOWERING THE CHARACTERISTIC MASS OF CLUSTER STARS BY MAGNETIC FIELDS AND OUTFLOW FEEDBACK","Zhiyun, Li; Peng, Wang; Abel, Tom; Nakamura, Fumitaka","30 DIRECT ENERGY CONVERSION; 79 ASTROPHYSICS, COSMOLOGY AND ASTRONOMY; MAGNETIC FIELDS; MAGNETOHYDRODYNAMICS; SIMULATION; STAR CLUSTERS; STARS; FLUID MECHANICS; HYDRODYNAMICS; MECHANICS","Magnetic fields are generally expected to increase the characteristic mass of stars formed in stellar clusters, because they tend to increase the effective Jeans mass. We test this expectation using adaptive mesh refinement magnetohydrodynamical simulations of cluster formation in turbulent magnetized clumps of molecular clouds, treating stars as accreting sink particles. We find that, contrary to the common expectation, a magnetic field of the strength in the observed range decreases, rather than increases, the characteristic stellar mass. It (1) reduces the number of intermediate-mass stars that are formed through direct turbulent compression, because sub-regions of the clump with masses comparable to those of stars are typically magnetically subcritical and cannot be compressed directly into collapse, and (2) increases the number of low-mass stars that are produced from the fragmentation of dense filaments. The filaments result from mass accumulation along the field lines. In order to become magnetically supercritical and fragment, the filament must accumulate a large enough column density (proportional to the field strength), which yields a high volume density (and thus a small thermal Jeans mass) that is conducive to forming low-mass stars. We find, in addition, that the characteristic stellar mass is reduced further by outflow feedback. The conclusion is that both magnetic fields and outflow feedback are important in shaping the stellar initial mass function.","","Available from http://dx.doi.org/10.1088/2041-8205/720/1/L26","","","","United States","2010-09-01T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: Astrophysical Journal Letters; Journal Volume: 720; Journal Issue: 1; Other Information: DOI: 10.1088/2041-8205/720/1/L26","","Medium: X; Size: page(s) L26-L30","","","","Journal ID: ISSN 2041-8205; TRN: US10Q5324047912","10.1088/2041-8205/720/1/L26","","2011-07-07T00:00:00Z","21452851","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/21452851","","Astrophysical Journal Letters","1","720"

Water content was determined gravimetrically under liquid hydration and at 100, 75.3, and 11.3% relative humidity (RH). Water content exponentially decreased from the H{sup +}-form membrane water uptake isotherm to the Na{sup +}-form isotherm when hydrated by water vapor. Ninety percent of this decrease is reached at a substitution level of 0.2Na{sup +}/SO{sub 3}{sup -}. Water uptake under liquid water hydration decreased more gradually, only 50% to completion at 0.2Na{sup +}/SO{sub 3}{sup -}. Four-probe conductivity testing of Nafion 115 membranes, normalized against dry dimensions, revealed that although hydration decreases immediately with the introduction of sodium impurities, ionic conductivity at 100% RH remains constant up to 0.15Na{sup +}/SO{sub 3}{sup -}. Above 0.15Na{sup +}/SO{sub 3}{sup -} an exponential decrease in ionic conductivity is observed with higher sodium content.

Starting from the observed filament widths and using the concepts of braided magnetic fields, an estimate of the turbulence level in the coronal loops can be obtained. Magnetic turbulence in the presence of a background magnetic field can be strongly anisotropic, and such anisotropy influences the separation of magnetic field lines, as well as the magnetic field line diffusion coefficient. Careful computations of the magnetic field line diffusion coefficient D{sub m} and of the rate of exponential separation of magnetic field lines h, also allowing for the possibility of anisotropic magnetic turbulence, enable computation of the effective perpendicular diffusion coefficient for electrons. When compared with observations this yields magnetic turbulence levels on the order of {delta}B/B {sub 0} = 0.05-0.7, which are larger than previous estimates. These values of the magnetic fluctuation level support the idea that magnetic turbulence can contribute to coronal heating by means of MHD turbulence dissipation. It is also found that field line transport is not governed by the quasilinear regime, but by a nonlinear regime which includes an intermediate and the percolation regimes.","","Available from http://dx.doi.org/10.1088/0004-637X/719/2/1912","","","","United States","2010-08-20T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: Astrophysical Journal; Journal Volume: 719; Journal Issue: 2; Other Information: DOI: 10.1088/0004-637X/719/2/1912","","Medium: X; Size: page(s) 1912-1917","","","","Journal ID: ISSN 0004-637X; ASJOAB; TRN: US10Q5505052213","10.1088/0004-637X/719/2/1912","","2011-07-21T00:00:00Z","21457042","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/21457042","","Astrophysical Journal","2","719"

The 'edge' of the interstellar cloud presently surrounding the heliosphere extends less than 0.1 pc in the upwind direction, terminating at an unknown distance, indicating that the outer boundary conditions of the heliosphere could change during the lifetime of the IBEX satellite. Using reasonable values for future outer heliosphere boundary conditions, ENA fluxes are predicted for one possible source of ENAs coming from outside of the heliopause. The ENA-production simulations use three-dimensional MHD plasma models of the heliosphere that include a kinetic description of neutrals and a Lorentzian distribution for ions. Based on this ENA-production model, it is then shown that the sensitivities of the IBEX 1.1 keV skymaps are sufficient to detect the variations in ENA fluxes that are expected to accompany the solar transition into the next upwind cloud. Approximately 20% of the IBEX 1.1 keV pixels appear capable of detecting the predicted model differences at the 3{sigma} level, with these pixels concentrated in the Ribbon region. Regardless of the detailed ENA production model, the success of the modeled B {center_dot} R {approx} 0 directions in reproducing the Ribbon locus, together with our results, indicates that the Ribbon phenomenon traces the variations in the heliosphere distortion caused by the relative pressures of the interstellar magnetic and gaseous components.","","Available from http://dx.doi.org/10.1088/0004-637X/719/2/1984","","","","United States","2010-08-20T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: Astrophysical Journal; Journal Volume: 719; Journal Issue: 2; Other Information: DOI: 10.1088/0004-637X/719/2/1984","","Medium: X; Size: page(s) 1984-1992","","","","Journal ID: ISSN 0004-637X; ASJOAB; TRN: US10Q5513052221","10.1088/0004-637X/719/2/1984","","2011-07-21T00:00:00Z","21457050","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/21457050","","Astrophysical Journal","2","719"

A significant challenge in the growth of aligned single, double and triple walled nanotubes is in the deposition of a controlled thickness catalyst layer. Conventional techniques using line of sight deposition such as sputtering and evaporation produce uniform catalyst layers only when extreme care is taken in the placement of flat substrates. Growth of aligned low wall number carbon nanotubes on contoured, complex geometry, or large surface area substrates is simply not technically feasible through these techniques. Using iron atomic layer deposition (ALD) with ferrocene and oxygen precursors for catalyst deposition circumvents the line of sight problems and allows for uniform coverage across almost all substrates. Furthermore the ALD technique allows for extremely accurate and reproducible thickness depositions. Using these ALD catalyst layers reproducible aligned arrays consisting of primarily double and triple wall CNTS can be fabricated. Conformal coatings onto high aspect ratio surfaces are particularly challenging. The walls of single carbon nanotubes in a nanotube array are inaccessible by line of sight techniques. ALD circumvents this problem by relying on a gas-surface reaction to initiate growth. Generally, growth of ALD films on CNTs results in beading of the deposited materials around CNT defects. This is particularly true of high surface energy materials. The number of nucleation sites and the onset of growth of Pt by ALD can be tuned by use of Ar plasma, O<sub>2</sub> plasma and chemical functionalization.","SPIE","","National Renewable Energy Lab.

Here, we present an approach that can be used for the rational design of cathode catalysts with potential use in phosphoric acid fuel cells, or in any environments containing strongly adsorbing tetrahedral anions. This approach is based on molecular patterning of platinum surfaces with cyanide adsorbates that can efficiently block the sites for adsorption of spectator anions while the oxygen reduction reaction proceeds unhindered. We also demonstrate that, depending on the supporting electrolyte anions and cations, on the same CN-covered Pt(111) surface, the oxygen reduction reaction activities can range from a 25-fold increase to a 50-fold decrease. This behaviour is discussed in the light of the role of covalent and non-covalent interactions in controlling the ensemble of platinum active sites required for high turn over rates of the oxygen reduction reaction.","","","Argonne National Lab.

"Multivariable Robust Control of a Simulated Hybrid Solid Oxide Fuel Cell Gas Turbine Plant","Tsai, Alex; Banta, Larry; Tucker, David; Gemmen, Randall","30 DIRECT ENERGY CONVERSION","This work presents a systematic approach to the multivariable robust control of a hybrid fuel cell gas turbine plant. The hybrid configuration under investigation built by the National Energy Technology Laboratory comprises a physical simulation of a 300kW fuel cell coupled to a 120kW auxiliary power unit single spool gas turbine. The public facility provides for the testing and simulation of different fuel cell models that in turn help identify the key difficulties encountered in the transient operation of such systems. An empirical model of the built facility comprising a simulated fuel cell cathode volume and balance of plant components is derived via frequency response data. Through the modulation of various airflow bypass valves within the hybrid configuration, Bode plots are used to derive key input/output interactions in transfer function format. A multivariate system is then built from individual transfer functions, creating a matrix that serves as the nominal plant in an H{sub {infinity}} robust control algorithm. The controller’s main objective is to track and maintain hybrid operational constraints in the fuel cell’s cathode airflow, and the turbo machinery states of temperature and speed, under transient disturbances. This algorithm is then tested on a Simulink/MatLab platform for various perturbations of load and fuel cell heat effluence. As a complementary tool to the aforementioned empirical plant, a nonlinear analytical model faithful to the existing process and instrumentation arrangement is evaluated and designed in the Simulink environment. This parallel task intends to serve as a building block to scalable hybrid configurations that might require a more detailed nonlinear representation for a wide variety of controller schemes and hardware implementations.","","","National Energy Technology Lab.

Nevertheless, the origin of small-scale eruptive events and how these are interrelated with larger scale CMEs have been poorly investigated so far. In this work, we study a series of small-scale side eruptions that occurred during and after a large-scale CME. Observations show that a CME can be associated not only with a single reconnection process, leading to the large-scale phenomenon, but also with many other side reconnections occurring at different locations and times around the main flux rope, possibly induced by the CME expansion in the surrounding corona. White light and EUV observations of a slow CME acquired by the SOHO/LASCO and SOHO/UVCS instruments are analyzed here to characterize the locations of side reconnections induced by the CME. The magnetic reconnection rate M has been estimated from the UVCS data from the ratio between the inflows and outflows observed around the reconnection region, and from the LASCO data from the observed aperture angles between the slow mode shocks (SMSs) associated with the reconnection. It turns out that M {approx_equal} 0.05 at the heliocentric distance of 1.8 R{sub sun}, while between {approx}2.5 and 5.5 R{sub sun}, M values progressively decrease with time/altitude from M {approx} 1 down to M {approx} 0.3. Such large values of M are theoretically acceptable only if flux pile-up reconnection is envisaged. The observed occurrence of multiple reconnections associated with a CME is verified by numerical simulations of an eruption occurring within multiple helmet streamers. The simulations confirm that small side reconnections are a consequence of CME expansion against the surrounding coronal streamers. The simulated and observed evolution of aperture angles between the SMSs are in good agreement as well. These results demonstrate the effect of the global coronal magnetic field in the occurrence of small-scale eruptions due to lateral reconnection in a preceding CME event.","","Available from http://dx.doi.org/10.1088/0004-637X/718/1/251","","","","United States","2010-07-20T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: Astrophysical Journal; Journal Volume: 718; Journal Issue: 1; Other Information: DOI: 10.1088/0004-637X/718/1/251","","Medium: X; Size: page(s) 251-265","","","","Journal ID: ISSN 0004-637X; ASJOAB; TRN: US10Q8067049614","10.1088/0004-637X/718/1/251","","2011-07-18T00:00:00Z","21455152","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/21455152","","Astrophysical Journal","1","718"

The idea is based on the fact that when waves travel accross different media, there are boundary conditions that must be satisfied, giving rise to Snell's-type laws. We find that the transmission through a velocity barrier is highly anisotropic, and that perfect transmission always occurs at normal incidence. When v{sub F} in the barrier is larger than the velocity outside the barrier, we find that a critical transmission angle exists, a Brewster-type angle for massless Dirac electrons.","","","","","","United States","2010-07-15T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: Physical Review.

High pressure reactivity studies show that Cunanoparticles supported on a ZnO(000{bar 1}) single crystal exhibit a higher catalytic activity than the Cu(111) planar surface. Complementary density functional theory (DFT) calculations of methanol synthesis were also performed for a Cu(111) surface and unsupported Cu{sub 29} nanoparticles, and the results support a higher activity for Cu nanoparticles. The DFT calculations show that methanol synthesis on Cu surfaces proceeds through a formate intermediate and the overall reaction rate is limited by both formate and dioxomethylene hydrogenation. Moreover, the superior activity of the nanoparticle is associated with its fluxionality and the presence of low-coordinated Cu sites, which stabilize the key intermediates, e.g. formate and dioxomethylene, and lower the barrier for the rate-limiting hydrogenation process. The reverse water-gas-shift (RWGS) reaction (CO{sub 2} + H{sub 2} {yields} CO + H{sub 2}O) was experimentally observed to compete with methanol synthesis and was also considered in our DFT calculations. In agreement with experiment, the rate of the RWGS reaction on Cu nanoparticles is estimated to be 2 orders of magnitude faster than methanol synthesis at T = 573 K. The experiments and calculations also indicate that CO produced by the fast RWGS reaction does not undergo subsequent hydrogenation to methanol, but instead simply accumulates as a product. Methanol production from CO hydrogenation via the RWGS pathway is hindered by the first hydrogenation of CO to formyl, which is not stable and prefers to dissociate into CO and H atoms on Cu. Our calculated results suggest that the methanol yield over Cu-based catalysts could be improved by adding dopants or promoters which are able to stabilize formyl species or facilitate the hydrogenation of formate and dioxomethylene. the RWGS pathway is hindered by the first hydrogenation of CO to formyl, which is not stable and prefers to dissociate into CO and H atoms on Cu.

With 10 % addition of Co, Cu, Ni, Fe, and Mn, the single phase orthorhombic perovskite structure remained stable over a wide range of oxygen partial pressures, as confirmed by X-ray diffraction. The substitution of Cu for chromium remarkably improved the sinterability and allowed full densification in air by sintering at 1400 degrees C. The substitution of Co and Ni significantly improved the electrical conductivity of yttrium chromites in both oxidizing and reducing environments. This was explained by the increase of charge carrier density with nickel and cobalt doping, as confirmed by Seebeck measurements. With 10% of nickel dopant, the electrical conductivity of Y0.8Ca0.2CrO3±δ increased from 12 to 38 S/cm in air and from 2 to 15 S/cm in reducing atmosphere at 950 degrees C.

Calculation of the electromagnetic force is essential to understand the EMF process. However, accurate calculation requires complex numerical solution, in which the coupling between the electromagnetic process and the deformation of workpiece needs be considered. In this paper, an appropriate formula has been developed to calculate the electromagnetic force in metal work-piece in the sheet EMF process. The effects of the geometric size of coil, the material properties, and the parameters of discharge circuit on electromagnetic force are taken into consideration. Through the formula, the electromagnetic force at different time and in different positions of the workpiece can be predicted. The calculated electromagnetic force and magnetic field are in good agreement with the numerical and experimental results. The accurate prediction of the electromagnetic force provides an insight into the physical process of the EMF and a powerful tool to design optimum EMF systems.","","","","","","United States","2010-06-15T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: Journal of Applied Physics; Journal Volume: 107; Journal Issue: 12; Other Information: DOI: 10.1063/1.3437201; (c) 2010 American Institute of Physics","","Medium: X; Size: page(s) 124907-124907.7","","","","Journal ID: ISSN 0021-8979; JAPIAU; TRN: US10B6479069779","10.1063/1.3437201","","2011-09-12T00:00:00Z","21476336","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/21476336","","Journal of Applied Physics","12","107"

The current study examines the effects of palladium addition on the high temperature joint strength of specimens prepared from yttria stabilized zirconia (YSZ) bars brazed with the binary Ag-CuOx, and 15Pd-Ag-CuO. It was found that while the binary Ag-CuOx system exhibits stronger room temperature strength than the 15Pd system the strength is reduced to values equivalent of the 15Pd system at 800°C. The 15Pd system exhibits a lower ambient temperature strength that is retained at 800°C. In both systems the failure mechanism at high temperature appears to be peeling of the noble metal component from the oxide phases and tearing through the noble metal phase whereas sufficient adhesion is retained at lower temperatures to cause fracture of the YSZ substrate.","","","Pacific Northwest National Lab.

Samples were characterized by SEM/EDS and XRD to monitor the secondary phase formation. Exposure of ferritic stainless steels to P led to the formation of surface Cr-Mn-P-O and Fe-P-O compounds and increased temperatures accelerated the rate of interactions. Fewer interactions were observed after exposures to As and Sb. No sulfur containing compounds were found. Nickel-based alloy exhibited much stronger interactions with As and P in comparison with ferritic steels and the arsenic interactions were particularly strong. The difference between the iron- and nickel-based alloys is explained by the different chemistry and morphology of the scales grown on the alloy surfaces in coal gas. While P and As interactions with the metallic parts in the SOFC are likely to mitigate the nickel/zirconia anode poisoning, the other degradation mechanisms should be taken into consideration to avoid potential stack failures.

High density Gd0.10Ce0.90O2 (GDC), Y0.15Zr0.85O2 (YSZ) and La0.6Sr0.4Co0.2Fe0.8O2 (LSCF) sintered pellets were covered with 3 to 30 nm Cr - overlayers that were subsequently oxidized, forming Cr2O3. Standard 18O tracer diffusion experiments at 800°C were performed and TOFSIMS profiling revealed a Cr2O3 thickness-dependent oxygen uptake process. The oxygen ion diffusion coefficients were found to be unaffected by the Cr2O3 overlayers, which is predictable since they are a bulk property. The extracted surface exchange coefficients however varied with Cr2O3 overlayer thickness. Solid state reaction measurements of Cr2O3 with the three materials of interest, and electronic structure considerations concerning the surface exchange, led to the conclusion that the observed oxygen uptake hindrance for LSCF and the slight increase of the surface exchange coefficient for YSZ can be attributed to the electronic properties of Cr2O3. The rate limitation of the oxygen incorporation into the materials is therefore strongly dependent on the surface electronic properties. A critical thickness of Cr2O3 was determined where the transition from decreased cathode-performance to a Cr2O3-property-governed regime occurs.","","","Pacific Northwest National Lab.

The governing magnetohydrodynamic equations of these waves in axisymmetric flux tubes of arbitrary radial and axial plasma structuring are derived and we study their observable properties for various equilibria in both thin and finite-width magnetic flux tubes. For thin flux tubes, it is demonstrated that observation of the eigenmodes of torsional Alfven waves can provide temperature diagnostics of both the internal and surrounding plasma.

By presenting a derivation of the energy balance equation and transfer functions for compressible magnetohydrodynamics, we quantify the source of magnetic energy on a scale-by-scale basis. We rule out the two alternative mechanisms for the generation of the small-scale magnetic field in the simulations: the tangling of magnetic field lines associated with the turbulent cascade and Alfvenization of small-scale velocity fluctuations ('turbulent induction'). Instead, we find that the dominant source of small-scale magnetic energy is stretching by inertial-range fluid motions of small-scale magnetic field lines against the magnetic tension force to produce (against Ohmic dissipation) more small-scale magnetic field. The scales involved become smaller with increasing Reynolds number, which identifies the dynamo as a small-scale turbulent dynamo.","","Available from http://dx.doi.org/10.1088/0004-637X/714/2/1606","","","","United States","2010-05-10T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: Astrophysical Journal; Journal Volume: 714; Journal Issue: 2; Other Information: DOI: 10.1088/0004-637X/714/2/1606","","Medium: X; Size: page(s) 1606-1616","","","","Journal ID: ISSN 0004-637X; ASJOAB; TRN: US10I2012043600","10.1088/0004-637X/714/2/1606","","2011-07-07T00:00:00Z","21448805","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/21448805","","Astrophysical Journal","2","714"

The preparation of the YSZ electrolyte tapes with various thicknesses was accomplished by using doctor blades with different gaps between the precision machined, polished blade and the casting surface. The green tape was cut into discs, sintered at 1385°C for 2 h, and subsequently creep-flattened at 1350°C for 2 h. Either LSCF with an SDC interlayer or LSM+YSZ composite was used as the cathode material for the fuel cells. The ohmic resistances of these anode-supported fuel cells were characterized by electrochemical impedance spectroscopy at temperatures from 500°C to 750°C. A linear relationship was found between the ohmic resistance of the fuel cell and the YSZ electrolyte thickness at all the measuring temperatures for both LSCF and LSM+YSZ cathode fuel cells. The ionic conductivities of the YSZ electrolyte, derived for the fuel cells with LSM+YSZ or LSCF cathodes, were independent of the cathode material and cell configuration. The ionic conductivities of the YSZ electrolyte was slightly lower than that of the bulk material, possibly due to Ni-doping into the electrolyte. The fuel cell with a SDC interlayer and LSCF cathode showed larger intercept resistance than the fuel cell with LSM+YSZ cathode, which was possibly due to the imperfect contact between the SDC interlayer and the YSZ electrolyte and the migration of Zr into the SDC interlayer to form an insulating solid solution during cell fabrication. Calculations of the contribution of the YSZ electrolyte to the total ohmic resistance showed that YSZ was still a satisfactory electrolyte at temperatures above 650°C. Explorations should be directed to reduce the intercept resistance to achieve significant improvement in cell performance.","","","Pacific Northwest National Lab.

However, it has always been dehydrogenated and re-hydrogenated in the liquid state until recently. The solid-state hydriding and dehydriding are necessary in order to achieve hydrogen uptake and release near the ambient temperature. In this study, the solid-state hydriding mechanism of 2LiH+MgB2 mixtures has been investigated for the first time. It is found that the solid-state hydriding proceeds in two elementary steps. The first step is the ion exchange between the Mg2+ and Li+ ions in the MgB2 crystal to form an intermediate compound (Mg1-xLi2x)B2. The second step is the continuous ion exchange and simultaneous hydrogenation of (Mg1-xLi2x)B2 to form LiBH4 and MgH2.

Recently, the use of magnetic supports has become a promising research topic for easy separation and recovery of catalysts using magnets, such as Pt nanoparticles supported on iron oxide nanoparticles. The attachment of Pt on iron oxide nanoparticles is limited by the wetting ability of the Pt (metal) on ceramic surfaces. A study of Pt nanoparticle attachment on iron oxide nanoparticle surfaces in an organic solvent is reported, which addresses the factors that promote or inhibit such attachment. It was discovered that the Pt attachment strongly depends on the capping molecules of the iron oxide seeds and the reaction temperature. For example, the attachment of Pt nanoparticles on oleic acid coated iron oxide nanoparticles was very challenging, because of the strong binding between the carboxylic groups and iron oxide surfaces. In contrast, when nanoparticles are coated with oleic acid/tri-n-octylphosphine oxide or oleic acid/oleylamine, a significant increase in Pt attachment was observed. Electronic structure calculations were then applied to estimate the binding energies between the capping molecules and iron ions, and the modeling results strongly support the experimental observations.","","","Pacific Northwest National Lab.

Experimental data from differential scanning calorimetry measurements between 70 and 85oC were used to develop isothermal and adiabatic reactivity models that could be extrapolated down to temperatures of interest. Results of the analysis show that solid ammonia borane is metastable in the 50-60oC range, having stability against appreciable reaction on the order of a week at 60oC and months at 50oC. An adiabatic analysis is the most extreme case, and stability of many days under such extreme conditions indicates that solid ammonia borane may be suited to most hydrogen storage applications.

Compared to the fast hydrogen oxidation at the anode, the sluggish oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) at the cathode requires high-performance catalysts. Currently, platium (Pt) nanoparticles supported on high surface area carbons remain the best catalysts for ORR. However, both instability and high cost of Pt-based catalysts represent two main obstacles limiting the commercial applications of PEMFCs. The instability of supported Pt catalysts is mainly due to the corrosion of carbon support under operation conditions and the agglomation and detachment of Pt particles, leading to a decrease in catalytic surface areas. Development of corrosion resistant supports and enhancement of the interactions between Pt and supports are two strategies to improve the cathode long-term activity.","","","Pacific Northwest National Lab.

It has been shown that realization of magnetoelectric coupling in single-phase multiferroic such as BiFeO3 requires ferroelastic (71o, 109o) rather than ferroelectric (180o) domain switching [6]. However, the control of such ferroleastic switching in a singlephase system has been a significant challenge as elastic interactions tend to destabilize small switched volumes, resulting in subsequent ferroelastic backswitching at zero electric field, thus disappearance of nonvolatile information storage [10, 11]. Guided by our phase-field simulations, we here report an approach to stabilize ferroelastic switching by eliminating the stress-induced instability responsible for back-switching using isolated monodomain BiFeO3islands. This work demonstrates a critical step to control and utilize nonvolatile magnetoelectric coupling at the nanoscale. Beyond magnetoelectric coupling, it provides a framework for exploring a route to control multiple order parameters coupled to ferroelastic order in other low-symmetry materials.","","","Pacific Northwest National Lab.

The interaction, however, is not the typically assumed formation of insulating La- and/or Sr-zirconate, but rather the result of Ni diffusion from the anode through the YSZ electrolyte and into the LSM resulting in coarsening and increased densification of the LSM microstructure. As an alternative to the use of a protective ceria interlayer, the presence of YSZ in the cathode material was able to suppress coarsening of LSM, thereby significantly improving the electrochemical performance.","The Electrochemical Society","","Pacific Northwest National Lab.

"Methanol Synthesis from H-2 and CO2 on a Mo6S8 Cluster: A Density Functional Study","Liu, P; Choi, Y M; Yang, Y; White, M G","10 SYNTHETIC FUELS; 30 DIRECT ENERGY CONVERSION; ATOMS; CATALYSTS; CLEAVAGE; FUNCTIONALS; GEOMETRY; HYDROCARBONS; HYDROGENATION; METHANOL; MOLYBDENUM SULFIDES; SYNTHESIS; WATER GAS; density functional theory; catalysis; methanold synthesis; functional nanomaterials","Catalytic CO{sub 2} hydrogenation to methanol has received considerable attention as an effective way to utilize CO{sub 2}. In this paper, density functional theory was employed to investigate the methanol synthesis from CO{sub 2} and H{sub 2} on a Mo{sub 6}S{sub 8} cluster. The Mo{sub 6}S{sub 8} cluster is the structural building block of the Chevrel phase of molybdenum sulfide, and has a cagelike structure with an octahedral Mo{sub 6} metallic core. Our calculations indicate that the preferred catalytic pathway for methanol synthesis on the Mo{sub 6}S{sub 8} cluster is very different from that of bulklike MoS{sub 2}. MoS{sub 2} promotes the C-O scission of H{sub x}CO intermediates, and therefore, only hydrocarbons are produced. The lower S/Mo ratio for the cluster compared to stoichiometric MoS{sub 2} might be expected to lead to higher activity because more low-coordinated Mo sites are available for reaction. However, our results show that the Mo{sub 6}S{sub 8} cluster is not as reactive as bulk MoS{sub 2} because it is unable to break the C-O bond of H{sub x}CO intermediates and therefore cannot produce hydrocarbons. Yet, the Mo{sub 6}S{sub 8} cluster is predicted to have moderate activity for converting CO{sub 2} and H{sub 2} to methanol. The overall reaction pathway involves the reverse water-gas shift reaction (CO{sub 2} + H{sub 2} {yields} CO + H{sub 2}O), followed by CO hydrogenation via HCO (CO + 2H{sub 2} {yields} CH{sub 3}OH) to form methanol. The rate-limiting step is CO hydrogenation to the HCO with a calculated barrier of +1 eV. This barrier is much lower than that calculated for a comparably sized Cu nanoparticle, which is the prototypical metal catalyst used for methanol synthesis from syngas (CO + H{sub 2}). Both the Mo and S sites participate in the reaction with CO{sub 2}, CO, and CH{sub x}O preferentially binding to the Mo sites, whereas S atoms facilitate H-H bond cleavage by forming relatively strong S-H bonds. Our study reveals that the unexpected activity of the Mo{sub 6}S{sub 8} cluster is the result of the interplay between shifts in the Mo d-band and S p-band and its unique cagelike geometry.","","","Brookhaven National Lab.

With particular focus on MRI experiments with liquid metals, which have small magnetic Prandtl numbers, it has been shown that the helical version of this instability (HMRI) has a scaling behavior that is quite different from that of the standard MRI (SMRI). We discuss the relation of HMRI to SMRI by exploring various parameter dependencies. We identify the mechanism of transfer of instability between modes through a spectral exceptional point that explains both the transition from a stationary instability (SMRI) to an unstable traveling wave (HMRI) and the excitation of HMRI in the inductionless limit. For certain parameter regions, we find new islands of the HMRI.","","Available from http://dx.doi.org/10.1088/0004-637X/712/1/52","","","","United States","2010-03-20T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: Astrophysical Journal; Journal Volume: 712; Journal Issue: 1; Other Information: DOI: 10.1088/0004-637X/712/1/52","","Medium: X; Size: page(s) 52-68","","","","Journal ID: ISSN 0004-637X; ASJOAB; TRN: US10O2433121753","10.1088/0004-637X/712/1/52","","2011-02-07T00:00:00Z","21394291","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/21394291","","Astrophysical Journal","1","712"

A previous model is updated to include for the first time the use of experimentally measured capillary pressure -- saturation relationships through the introduction of a Gaussian contact-angle distribution into the property equations. The updated model is used to simulate various limiting-case scenarios of water and gas transport in fuel-cell diffusion media. Analysis of these results demonstrate that interfacial conditions are more important than bulk transport in these layers, where the associated mass-transfer resistance is the result of higher capillary pressures at the boundaries and the steepness of the capillary pressure -- saturation relationship. The model is also used to examine the impact of a microporous layer, showing that it dominates the response of the overall diffusion medium. In addition, its primary mass-transfer-related effect is suggested to be limiting the water-injection sites into the more porous gas-diffusion layer.","","","Lawrence Berkeley National Lab.

This inverse CeO{sub 2}/CuO-Cu catalyst exhibits a higher activity than standard Cu/CeO{sub 2} catalysts. In situ synchrotron characterization techniques were employed to follow the structural changes of CeO{sub 2}/CuO-Cu under reaction conditions. Time-resolved X-ray diffraction experiments showed the transformation of CuO to metallic Cu via a Cu{sub 2}O intermediate. Short-order structural changes were followed by pair distribution function analysis and corroborated the results obtained by diffraction. Moreover, X-ray absorption spectroscopy also revealed oxidation state changes from Cu{sup 2+} to Cu{sup 0} and the partial reduction of CeOx nanoparticles. The activity data obtained by mass spectrometry revealed that hydrogen production starts once the copper has been fully reduced. The strong interaction of ceria and copper boosted the catalytic performance of the sample. The inverse catalyst was active at low temperatures, stable to several reaction runs and to redox cycles. These characteristics are highly valuable for mobile fuel cell applications. The active phases of the inverse CeO{sub 2}/CuO-Cu catalyst are partially reduced ceria nanoparticles strongly interacting with metallic copper. The nature and structure of the ceria nanoparticles are of critical importance because they are involved in processes related to water dissociation over the catalyst surface.","","","Brookhaven National Lab.

Observations of young, rapidly rotating stars indicate that many possess substantial magnetic activity and strong axisymmetric magnetic fields. We conduct simulations of dynamo action in rapidly rotating suns with the three-dimensional magnetohydrodynamic anelastic spherical harmonic (ASH) code to explore the complex coupling between rotation, convection, and magnetism. Here, we study dynamo action realized in the bulk of the convection zone for a system rotating at 3 times the current solar rotation rate. We find that substantial organized global-scale magnetic fields are achieved by dynamo action in this system. Striking wreaths of magnetism are built in the midst of the convection zone, coexisting with the turbulent convection. This is a surprise, for it has been widely believed that such magnetic structures should be disrupted by magnetic buoyancy or turbulent pumping. Thus, many solar dynamo theories have suggested that a tachocline of penetration and shear at the base of the convection zone is a crucial ingredient for organized dynamo action, whereas these simulations do not include such tachoclines. We examine how these persistent magnetic wreaths are maintained by dynamo processes and explore whether a classical mean-field alpha-effect explains the regeneration of poloidal field. We find that the global-scale toroidal magnetic fields are maintained by an OMEGA-effect arising from the differential rotation, while the global-scale poloidal fields arise from turbulent correlations between the convective flows and magnetic fields. These correlations are not well represented by an alpha-effect that is based on the kinetic and magnetic helicities.","","Available from http://dx.doi.org/10.1088/0004-637X/711/1/424","","","","United States","2010-03-01T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: Astrophysical Journal; Journal Volume: 711; Journal Issue: 1; Other Information: DOI: 10.1088/0004-637X/711/1/424","","Medium: X; Size: page(s) 424-438","","","","Journal ID: ISSN 0004-637X; ASJOAB; TRN: US10O3712121817","10.1088/0004-637X/711/1/424","","2011-02-07T00:00:00Z","21394355","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/21394355","","Astrophysical Journal","1","711"

Cost-effective improvements to current technological approaches have made great progress, but certain challenges remain. As feature sizes of the latest generations of electronic devices are approaching atomic dimensions, circuit speeds are now being limited by interconnect bottlenecks. This has prompted innovations such as the introduction of new materials into microelectronics manufacturing at an unprecedented rate and alternative technologies to silicon CMOS architectures. Despite the environmental impact of conventional fossil fuel consumption, the low cost of these energy sources has been a long-standing economic barrier to the development of alternative and more efficient renewable energy sources, fuel cells and batteries. In the face of mounting environmental concerns, interest in such alternative energy sources has grown. It is now widely accepted that nanotechnology offers potential solutions for securing future progress in information and energy technologies. The Canadian Semiconductor Technology Conference (CSTC) forum was established 25 years ago in Ottawa as an important symbol of the intrinsic strength of the Canadian semiconductor research and development community, and the Canadian semiconductor industry as a whole. In 2007, the 13th CSTC was held in Montreal, moving for the first time outside the national capital region. The first three meetings in the series of Nano and Giga Challenges in Electronics and Photonics NGCM2002 in Moscow, NGCM2004 in Krakow, and NGC2007 in Phoenix were focused on interdisciplinary research from the fundamentals of materials science to the development of new system architectures. In 2009 NGC2009 and the 14th Canadian Semiconductor Technology Conference (CSTC2009) were held as a joint event, hosted by McMaster University (10 14 August, Hamilton, Ontario, Canada) and the scope was expanded to include renewable energy research and development. This special issue of Nanotechnology is devoted to a better understanding of the function and design of semiconductor devices that are relevant to information technology (both electronics and photonics based) and renewable energy applications. The papers contained in this special issue are selected from the NGC/CSTC2009 symposium. Among them is a report by Ray LaPierre from McMaster University and colleagues at the University of Waterloo in Canada on the ability to manipulate single spins in nanowire quantum bits. The paper also reports the development of a testbed of a few qubits for general quantum information processing tasks [1]. Lower cost and greater energy conversion efficiency compared with thin film devices have led to a high level of activity in nanowire research related to photovoltaic applications. This special issue also contains results from an impedance spectroscopy study of core shell GaAs nanowires to throw light on the transport and recombination mechanisms relevant to solar cell research [2]. Information technology research and renewable energy sources are research areas of enormous public interest. This special issue addresses both theoretical and experimental achievements and provides a stimulating outlook for technological developments in these highly topical fields of research.

Kotter Idaho National Laboratory Steven D. Novack Idaho National Laboratory W. Dennis Slafer MicroContinuum, Inc. Patrick Pinhero University of Missouri ABSTRACT The research described in this paper explores a new and efficient approach for producing electricity from the abundant energy of the sun, using nanoantenna (nantenna) electromagnetic collectors (NECs). NEC devices target mid-infrared wavelengths, where conventional photovoltaic (PV) solar cells are inefficient and where there is an abundance of solar energy. The initial concept of designing NECs was based on scaling of radio frequency antenna theory to the infrared and visible regions. This approach initially proved unsuccessful because the optical behavior of materials in the terahertz (THz) region was overlooked and, in addition, economical nanofabrication methods were not previously available to produce the optical antenna elements. This paper demonstrates progress in addressing significant technological barriers, including: 1) development of frequency-dependent modeling of double-feedpoint square spiral nantenna elements; 2) selection of materials with proper THz properties; and 3) development of novel manufacturing methods that could potentially enable economical large-scale manufacturing. We have shown that nantennas can collect infrared energy and induce THz currents, and we have also developed cost-effective proof-of-concept fabrication techniques for the large-scale manufacture of simple square loop nantenna arrays. Future work is planned to embed rectifiers into the double-feedpoint antenna structures. This work represents an important first step toward the ultimate realization of a low-cost device that will collect as well as convert this radiation into electricity. This could lead to a broadband, high conversion efficiency low-cost solution to complement conventional PV devices.","","","Idaho National Lab.

Tests with both anode-supported and electrolyte-supported button cells were performed at 700 to 800oC in synthetic coal gas containing 0.5 to 10 ppm phosphorus, introduced as phosphine. Two primary modes of degradation were observed. The most obvious was the formation of a series of bulk nickel phosphide phases, of which Ni3P, Ni5P2, Ni12P5 and Ni2P were identified. Phosphorus was essentially completely captured by the anode, forming a sharp boundary between converted and unconverted anode portions. These products partially coalesced into large grains, which eventually affected electronic percolation through the anode support. Thermodynamic calculations predict that formation of the first binary nickel phosphide phase is possible at sub-parts per billion concentrations in coal gas at temperatures relevant to fuel cell operation. A second mode of degradation is attributed to surface diffusion of phosphorus to the active anode/electrolyte interface to form an adsorption layer. Direct evidence for the presence of such an adsorption layer on nickel was obtained by surface spectroscopies on fracture surfaces. Further, cell performance losses were observed well before the entire anode was converted to bulk nickel phosphide. Impedance spectroscopy revealed that these losses were primarily due to growth in electrodic resistance, whereas large ohmic increases were visible when the entire anode was converted to nickel phosphide phases. The rate of resistance growth for anode-supported cells showed a very low dependence on phosphorus concentration, attributed to phosphorus activity control within the anode by bulk nickel phosphide products.","","","Pacific Northwest National Lab.

The EET ability of Shewanella species is consistent with their ability to generate electric current in microbial fuel cells in the absence of exogenous electron shuttles (4). Various strategies of extracellular electron transfer have been proposed in metal-reducing microbes, including naturally-occurring (2) or biogenic (5-7) soluble mediators that ‘shuttle’ electrons from cells to acceptors, as well as direct transfer using multiheme cytochromes located on the cell exterior (8) and transfer via conductive nanowires (9-11). S. oneidensis MR-1 features several proteins that are involved with the transport of electrons to the exterior of the cell where they play an important role with regard to the reduction of solid electron acceptors such as metal oxides. These include two outer-membrane decaheme c-type cytochromes (MtrC and OmcA), a membrane spanning protein (MtrB), and two periplasmic multi-heme c-type cytochromes (MtrA and CymA). Deletion of the genes encoding any of these proteins leads to phenotypes that are greatly inhibited with regard to metal-oxide reduction and current production in microbial fuel cells (MFCs) (12, 13). The mutation of genes that code for proteins involved in the movement of cytochromes to the outer membrane also results in loss of metal-reducing phenotypes (13). The shewanellae are highly motile, by virtue of a single polar flagellum, and individual S. oneidensis MR-1 cells have been tracked swimming at speeds of up to, and sometimes over, 100 μm/sec, although the average swimming speed of cells in a population is considerably lower (14). Research has also shown that S. oneidensis MR-1 also displays chemotactic responses to several soluble electron acceptors, including Fe(III) citrate (15, 16) and that the CheA-3 histidine protein kinase is required for this chemotactic behavior to be observed (14). Strain MR-1 has 4 also been shown to be very sensitive to the presence of electron acceptors. For example, strain MR-1 ceases motility after a short time in the absence of an electron acceptor; however motility can be restored upon the re-addition of an electron acceptor. Here we present data that suggest that the shewanellae exhibit a motility response not previously reported: we call it electrokinesis. This response occurs intermittently with the cells in proximity to a solid electron acceptor, such as a manganese oxide particle or the working electrode of an electrochemical cell, and motility is observed to increase after contact. In addition to increased swimming velocities, cells occasionally pause on the solid acceptor surface, then after brief contact (up to 1 second) the cells typically swim away in the opposite direction from which they approached. Electrokinesis is not a uniform response that can be observed in all cells, although if an electron shuttle is added, all cells rapidly become motile.","","","Pacific Northwest National Lab.

GMPC is prepared through graphitizing the self-assembled soft-template mesoporous carbon (MPC) under high temperature. Heat-treatment at 2800 C greatly improves the degree of graphitization while most of the mesoporous structures and the specific surface area of MPC are retained. GMPC is then noncovalently functionalized with poly(diallyldimethylammonium chloride) (PDDA) and loaded with Pt nanoparticles by reducing Pt precursor (H{sub 2}PtCl{sub 6}) in ethylene glycol. Pt nanoparticles of {approx}3.0 nm in diameter are uniformly dispersed on GMPC. Compared to Pt supported on Vulcan XC-72 carbon black (Pt/XC-72), Pt/GMPC exhibits a higher mass activity towards oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) and the mass activity retention (in percentage) is improved by a factor of {approx}2 after 44 h accelerated degradation test under the potential step (1.4-0.85 V) electrochemical stressing condition which focuses on support corrosion. The enhanced activity and durability of Pt/GMPC are attributed to the graphitic structure of GMPC which is more resistant to corrosion. These findings demonstrate that GMPC is a promising oxygen reduction electrocatalyst support for PEM fuel cells. The approach reported in this work provides a facile, eco-friendly promising strategy for synthesizing stable metal nanoparticles on hydrophobic support materials.","","","Oak Ridge National Lab.

Despite significant progress, a pivotal performance/durability limitation in PEFCs centers on two-phase transport and mass transport loss originating from suboptimal liquid water transport and flooding phenomena. Liquid water blocks the porous pathways in the gas diffusion layer (GDL) and the catalyst layer (CL), thus hindering oxygen transport from the flow field to the electrochemically actives sites in the catalyst layer. Different approaches have been examined to model the underlying transport mechanisms in the PEFC with different levels of complexities. Due to the macroscopic nature, these two-phase models fail to resolve the underlying structural influence on the transport and performance. Mesoscopic modeling at the pore-scale offers great promise in elucidating the underlying structure-transport-performance interlinks in the PEFC porous components. In this article, a systematic review of the recent progress and prospects of pore-scale modeling in the context of two-phase transport in the PEFC is presented. Specifically, the efficacy of lattice Boltzmann (LB), pore morphology (PM) and pore network (PN) models coupled with realistic delineation of microstructures in fostering enhanced insight into the underlying liquid water transport in the PEFC GDL and CL is highlighted.","","","Oak Ridge National Lab.

A highly instrumented apparatus consisting of a hot (exhaust gas) and a cold (coolant liquid) side rectangular ducts enclosing the thermoelectric elements has been built. Measurements of thermoelectric voltage output and flow and surface temperatures were acquired and analyzed to investigate the power generation and heat transfer properties of the apparatus. Effects of inserting aluminum wool packing material inside the hot side duct on augmentation of heat transfer from the gas stream to duct walls were studied. Data were collected for both the unpacked and packed cases to allow for detection of packing influence on flow and surface temperatures. Effects of gas and coolant inlet temperatures as well as gas flow rate on the thermoelectric power output were examined. The results indicate that thermoelectric power production is increased at higher gas inlet temperature or flow rate. However, thermoelectric power generation decreases with a higher coolant temperature as a consequence of the reduced hot-cold side temperature differential. For the hot-side duct, a large temperature gradient exists between the gas and solid surface temperature due to poor heat transfer through the gaseous medium. Adding the packing material inside the exhaust duct enhanced heat transfer and hence raised hot-side duct surface temperatures and thermoelectric power compared to the unpacked duct, particularly where the gas-to-surface temperature differential is highest.

Despite its apparent simplicity, how the reaction proceeds on different metals is not yet well understood. We present a systematic study of O{sub 2} reduction on the (111) facets of eight transition metals (Rh, Ir, Ni, Pd, Pt, Cu, Ag, and Au) based on periodic density functional theory (DFT-GGA) calculations. Analysis of ten surface elementary reaction steps suggests three selectivity regimes as a function of the binding energy of atomic oxygen (BEO), delineated by the opposite demands to catalyze O-O bond scission and O-H bond formation: The dissociative adsorption of O{sub 2} prevails on Ni, Rh, Ir, and Cu; the complete reduction to water via associative (peroxyl, peroxide, and aquoxyl) mechanisms prevails on Pd, Pt, and Ag; and HOOH formation prevails on Au. The reducing power of hydrogen is decreased electrochemically by increasing the electrode potential. This hinders the hydrogenation of oxygen species and shifts the optimal selectivity for water to less reactive metals. Our results point to the important role of the intrinsic reactivity of metals in the selectivity of O{sub 2} reduction, provide a unified basis for understanding the metal-catalyzed reduction of O{sub 2} to H{sub 2}O and HOOH, and offer useful insights for identifying new catalysts for desired oxygen reduction products.","","","Oak Ridge National Lab.

This paper describes tests to investigate the temporal evolution of the volume fraction of ceramic phases, the evolution of micro-damage, and the self-healing behavior of the glass ceramic sealant used in SOFCs. It was found that after the initial sintering process, further crystallization of the glass ceramic sealant does not stop, but slows down and reduces the residual glass content while boosting the ceramic crystalline content. Under the long-term operating environment, distinct fibrous and needle-like crystals in the amorphous phase disappeared, and smeared/diffused phase boundaries between the glass phase and ceramic phase were observed. Meanwhile, the micro-damage was induced by the cooling-down process from the operating temperature to the room temperature, which can potentially degrade the mechanical properties of the glass/ceramic sealant. The glass/ceramic sealant self-healed upon reheating to the SOFC operating temperature, which can restore the mechanical performance of the glass/ceramic sealant.","","","Pacific Northwest National Lab.

In this study, neutron diffraction patterns were recorded in-situ while a bulk porous Ni-NiO-YSZ anode was loaded under uniaxial compression. Single peak refinement was used to calculate the lattice strains of each phase in the composite, and the local stress state of each phase was derived from the measured lattice strains and the corresponding diffraction elastic constants. An internal triaxial stress state was observed to develop in the bulk of the specimen under plastic deformation, specifically in the Ni phase. Meanwhile, the NiO and YSZ phases are deforming elastically even in the macroscopically plastic regime of deformation. The von Mises equivalent stress was used to quantify the phase stress evolution. A significant stress concentration induced by the presence of pores becomes manifest in all three phase components. The reduction of stress concentration factor in Ni above the yield point of the composite can be attributed to a gradual change of the grains-pores morphology during the plastic deformation.","","","Oak Ridge National Lab.

Using a narrowly focused beam from the Advanced Photon Source, such chromium oxide deposits were unequivocally identified in the active region of the cathode by X-ray diffraction, suggesting that the triple phase boundaries were partially blocked. Under fuel cell operating conditions, the reaction has an equilibrium potential of about 0.9 V and the rate of chromium oxide deposition is therefore dependent on the operating potential of the cell. It becomes diffusion limited after several hours of steady operation. At low operating potentials, lanthanum manganite cathodes begin to be reduced to MnO, which reacts with the chromium oxide to form the MnCr{sub 2}O{sub 4} spinel.","","","Argonne National Lab.

Ca2+ doped lanthanum cobaltite materials are strong candidates for use as cathodes in lower temperature solid oxide fuel cells operating at or below 800oC. Among these four cobaltite compositions, two (LaCoO3 and La0.8Ca0.2CoO3) were found to be phase pure materials, whereas the remaining two compositions (La0.6Ca0.4CoO3 and La0.45Ca0.55CoO3) contained precipitation of secondary phases such as CaO and Co3O4. The mechanical properties of the four compositions, in terms of Young s modulus, four-point bending strength and fracture toughness measurements, were measured at both room temperature and 800oC. At room temperature, doping with Ca2+ was found to substantially increase the mechanical properties of the cobaltites, whereas at 800oC the pure LaCoO3 composition exhibited higher modulus and strength values than La0.8Ca0.2CoO3. All of the four compositions exhibited ferroelastic behavior, as shown by the hysteresis loops generated during uniaxial load-unload compression tests. Electrical conductivity measurements showed the La0.8Ca0.2CoO3 composition to have the highest conductivity among the four compositions.","","","Oak Ridge National Lab.

Despite their widespread use, carbon blacks are susceptible to corrosion during fuel cell operations. In this work, the corrosion behaviors of platinized Vulcan XC-72 nanoparticles under thermal and electrochemical conditions were monitored by transmission electron microscopy (TEM). The thermal corrosion experiment was carried out in a gas-cell TEM, which allows for a direct observation of the thermal oxidation behavior of the nanoparticles. The electrochemical corrosion experiment was performed outside of the TEM by loading the nanoparticles on a TEM grid and then electrochemically corroding them step by step followed by taking TEM images from exactly the same nanoparticles after each step. This work revealed four types of structural changes: (i) total removal of structurally weak aggregates, (ii) breakdown of aggregates via neck-breaking, (iii) center-hollowed primary particles caused by an inside-out corrosion starting from the center to outer region, and (iv) gradual decrease in the size of primary particles caused by a uniform removal of material from the surface. These structural changes took place in sequence or simultaneously depending on the competition of carbon corrosion dynamical processes. The results obtained from this work provide insight on carbon corrosion and its effects on fuel cells' long-term performance and durability.","","","Oak Ridge National Lab.

Such interconnects, however, contain high levels of chromium, which has been found to be associated with SOFC cathode performance degradation at SOFC operating temperatures; a phenomenon known as Cr poisoning. Here, we demonstrate an accurate measurement of the phase and concentration distributions of Cr species in a degraded SOFC, as well as related properties including deviatoric strain, integrated porosity, and lattice parameter variation, using high energy microbeam X-ray diffraction and radiography. We unambiguously identify (MnCr){sub 3}O{sub 4} and Cr{sub 2}O{sub 3} as the two main contaminant phases and find that their concentrations correlate strongly with the cathode layer composition. Cr{sub 2}O{sub 3} deposition within the active cathode region reduces porosity and produces compressive residual strains, which hinders the reactant gas percolation and can cause structural breakdown of the SOFC cathode. The information obtained through this study can be used to better understand the Cr-poisoning mechanism and improve SOFC design.","","","Argonne National Lab.

The total energy content of liquid fuels (including ethanol and hydrocarbon) produced from cellulosic biomass via biochemical or hybrid bio-thermochemical routes can vary from 49% to 70% of the biomass entering the biorefinery, on an energy basis. Use of boiler for combustion of residual organics and lignin results in significant energy and water losses. An alternate process to improve energy recovery from the residual organic streams is via use of bioelectrochemical systems such as microbial fuel cells (MFCs) microbial electrolysis cells (MECs). The potential advantages of this alternative scheme in a biorefinery include minimization of heat loss and generation of a higher value product, hydrogen. The need for 5-15 gallons of water per gallon of ethanol can be reduced significantly via recycle of water after MEC treatment. Removal of inhibitory byproducts such as furans, phenolics and acetate in MFC/MECs to generate energy, thus, has dual advantages including improvements in energy efficiency and ability to recycle water. Conversion of the sugar- and lignin- degradation products to hydrogen is synergistic with biorefinery hydrogen requirements for upgrading F-T liquids and other byproducts to high-octane fuels and/or high value products. Some of these products include sorbitol, succinic acid, furan and levulinate derivatives, glycols, polyols, 1,4-butenadiol, phenolics polymers, etc. Potential process alternatives utilizing MECs in biorefineries capable of improving energy efficiency by up to 30% are discussed.","","","Oak Ridge National Lab.

This inverse CeO{sub 2}/CuO-Cu catalyst exhibits a higher activity than standard Cu/CeO{sub 2} catalysts. In situ synchrotron characterization techniques were employed to follow the structural changes of CeO{sub 2}/CuO-Cu under reaction conditions. Time-resolved X-ray diffraction experiments showed the transformation of CuO to metallic Cu via a Cu{sub 2}O intermediate.

Moreover, X-ray absorption spectroscopy also revealed oxidation state changes from Cu{sup 2+} to Cu{sup 0} and the partial reduction of CeO{sub x} nanoparticles. The activity data obtained by mass spectrometry revealed that hydrogen production starts once the copper has been fully reduced. The strong interaction of ceria and copper boosted the catalytic performance of the sample. The inverse catalyst was active at low temperatures, stable to several reaction runs and to redox cycles. These characteristics are highly valuable for mobile fuel cell applications.

This process is studied for S{sub x}-poisoned nanoscale Pt- and Pt{sub 3}Co- on Vulcan carbon (Pt/VC and Pt{sub 3}Co/VC) in perchloric acid electrolyte using the {Delta}{mu} adsorbate isolation technique for in situ X-ray absorption spectroscopy. The {Delta}{mu} technique is modified to better distinguish the {Delta}{mu} signatures for H, O, and Sx on Pt. The resulting {Delta}{mu} analysis suggests that SO{sub 2} on nanoscale Pt is oxidized to bisulfate or sulfate species in two regions, near 1.05 V on the cluster edges of the Pt nanoparticle, and at higher potentials from the Pt(111) faces where oxygen is less strongly bound. The bisulfate or sulfate species desorb from the Pt surface at high potentials due to O(OH) adsorption/replacement and at low potentials due to loss of the Coulomb attraction between the bisulfate anion and the Pt. A similar oxidation process occurs for S{sub x}-poisoned Pt{sub 3}Co/VC, but at lower potentials because a ligand effect coming from Co shifts the oxidization potential of adsorbed SO{sub 2} to lower potentials while pushing OH adsorption to higher potentials. The spectroscopic results give insights into cyclic voltammetry data and are consistent with electrochemical cycling procedures for removing the sulfur.","","","Brookhaven National Lab.

Electrochemical characteristics are demonstrated in oxygen-saturated acid electrolyte by rotating disk electrode, cyclic voltammetry, as well as single fuel cell tests.

Efforts to deduce the responses of the individual components of the superlattice to applied fields have focused on theoretical approaches because of the limitations of available experimental techniques. Time-resolved x-ray microdiffraction provides a precise crystallographic probe of each component using the shift in wave vector and change in intensity of superlattice satellite reflections. We report in detail the methods to measure and analyze the x-ray diffraction patterns in applied electric field and their application to a 2-unit-cell BaTiO{sub 3}/4-unit-cell CaTiO{sub 3} superlattice. We find that the overall piezoelectric distortion is shared between the two components. Theoretical predictions of the electromechanical properties of a superlattice with the same composition constrained to tetragonal symmetry are in excellent agreement with the experiments. Lattice instability analysis, however, suggests that the low-temperature ground state could exhibit antiferrodistortive rotations of TiO{sub 6} octahedra within and/or at the interfaces of the CaTiO{sub 3} component.","","","Oak Ridge National Lab.

This work relies on a previous study performed by the National Energy Technology Laboratory (NETL) that details thermodynamic simulations of integrated gasification combined cycle (IGCC) systems and considers various gasifier types and includes cases for 90% CO2 capture (2007, “Cost and Performance Baseline for Fossil Energy Plants, Vol. 1: Bituminous Coal and Natural Gas to Electricity,” National Energy Technology Laboratory Report No. DOE/NETL-2007/1281). All systems in this study assume a Conoco Philips gasifier and cold-gas clean up conditions for the coal gasification system (Cases 3 and 4 in the NETL IGCC report). Four system arrangements, cases, are examined. Cases 1 and 2 remove the CO2 after the SOFC anode. Case 3 assumes steam addition, a water-gas-shift (WGS) catalyst, and a Selexol process to remove the CO2 in the gas cleanup section, sending a hydrogen-rich gas to the fuel cell anode. Case 4 assumes Selexol in the cold-gas cleanup section as in Case 3; however, there is no steam addition, and the WGS takes places in the SOFC and after the anode. Results demonstrate significant efficiency advantages compared with IGCC with CO2 capture. The hydrogen-rich case (Case 3) has better net electric efficiency compared with typical postanode CO2 capture cases (Cases 1 and 2), with a simpler arrangement but at a lower SOFC power density, or a lower efficiency at the same power density. Case 4 gives an efficiency similar to Case 3 but also at a lower SOFC power density. Carbon deposition concerns are also discussed","","","National Energy Technology Lab.

Advanced analytical techniques including electron microscopy (TEM/STEM), electron energy loss spectroscopy (EELS), and secondary ion mass spectrometry (SIMS) have been used to characterize CeO2/Ce0.85Sm0.15O2 multilayer thin films grown by pulsed laser deposition. High quality growth is observed, but ionic conductivity measured by impedance spectroscopy and 18O tracer experiments is consistent with bulk materials. EELS analysis reveals the unusual situation of layers containing only Ce(IV) adjacent to layers containing both Ce(III) and Ce(IV). Post oxygen annealing induced oxygen diffusion and mixed oxidation states in both layers, but only in the vicinity of low angle grain boundaries perpendicular to the layers. The implications of this remarkable metastability of Ce oxidation states on the design of novel electrolytes for solid oxide fuel cells is discussed.","","","Oak Ridge National Lab.

Over this period, the anode impedance decreased below the cathode impedance, suggesting a cathode limited power output. Decreasing the anode flow rate did not impact the anode impedance significantly, while it increased the cathode impedance by 65% . Reducing the anode-medium ionic strength from 100% to 10% increased the cathode impedance by 48%.","","","Oak Ridge National Lab.

Although equilibration is severely suppressed due to phase-space restrictions and conservation laws, it can lead to intriguing signatures in partially equilibrated quantum wires. We consider an ideal homogeneous quantum wire. At finite temperature we find a correction to the quantized conductance, which for a short wire scales with its length, but saturates in the limit of an infinitely long wire. We also discuss thermoelectric properties of long quantum wires. We show that the uniform quantum wire is a perfect thermoelectric refrigerator, approaching Carnot efficiency with increasing wire length.","","","Argonne National Lab.

Extensive experimental efforts over the last several years and the availability of 21 sequenced Shewanella genomes made it possible to collect and integrate a wealth of information on the genus into one public resource providing new avenues for making biological discoveries and for developing a system level understanding of the cellular processes. The Shewanella knowledgebase was established in 2005 to provide a framework for integrated genome-based studies on Shewanella ecophysiology. The present version of the knowledgebase provides access to a diverse set of experimental and genomic data along with tools for curation of genome annotations and visualization and integration of genomic data with experimental data. As a demonstration of the utility of this resource, we examined a single microarray data set from Shewanella oneidensis MR-1 for new insights into regulatory processes. The integrated analysis of the data predicted a new type of bacterial transcriptional regulation involving co-transcription of the intergenic region with the downstream gene and suggested a biological role for co-transcription that likely prevents the binding of a regulator of the upstream gene to the regulator binding site located in the intergenic region.
