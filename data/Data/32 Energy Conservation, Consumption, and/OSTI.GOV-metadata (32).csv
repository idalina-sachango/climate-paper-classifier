"Polaron-induced metal-to-insulator transition in vanadium oxides from density functional theory calculations","Kaur, Jasleen; Chandrappa, Manas Likhit Holekevi; Chen, Chi; Ong, Shyue Ping","32 ENERGY CONSERVATION, CONSUMPTION, AND UTILIZATION; neuromorphic computing; vanadium oxides; metal-insulator transition; defects; density of states; polarons; resistive switching; structural properties; transition temperature; Mott insulators; strongly correlated systems; density functional calculations; first-principles calculations","Vanadium oxides have been extensively studied as phase-change memory units in artificial synapses for neuromorphic computing due to their metal-insulator transitions (MIT) at or near room temperature. Recently, injection of charge carriers into vanadium oxides, e.g., via optically via a heterostructure, has been proposed as an alternative switching mechanism and also potentially as a means to tune the MIT temperature. In this study, we explore the formation of small polarons in the low temperature (LT) insulating phases for V<sub>3</sub>O<sub>5</sub>,VO<sub>2</sub>, and V<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub>, and the barriers to their migration using density functional theory calculations. We find that V<sub>3</sub>O<sub>5</sub> exhibits very low hole and electron polaron migration barriers (<100 meV) compared to V<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub> and VO<sub>2</sub>, leading to much higher estimated polaronic conductivity. We also link the relative migration barriers to the amount of distortion that has to travel when the polaron migrate from one site to another. Polarons in V<sub>3</sub>O<sub>5</sub> also have smaller binding energies to vanadium and oxygen vacancy defects. Furthermore, these results suggest that the triggering of the MIT via injection of charge carriers are due to the formation of small polarons that can migrate rapidly through the crystal.","American Physical Society (APS)","","Univ. of California, San Diego, CA (United States)","USDOE Office of Science (SC), Basic Energy Sciences (BES)","","United States","2023-03-30T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: Physical Review.

However, wood chips—which are a low-quality and plentiful waste byproduct of lumber milling, woodworking, and shipping operations—have low economic value and complicated disposal methods. In this paper, we propose a strategy for wood chip reuse through the fabrication of bio-based building insulation foam. Through a high-temperature chemical treatment delignification process, we introduced additional small pores within the wood chips, effectively lowering their thermal conductivity, and used them in combination with a binding agent to produce a porous insulation foam. The porous insulation foam achieved a low thermal conductivity of 0.038 W/(m·K) and a high compressive strength of 1.1 MPa (70% strain). These characteristics demonstrate that wood waste can be repurposed into an effective building material, addressing challenges in both waste management and sustainable construction.</p>","MDPI AG","","Inventwood LLC, College Park, MD (United States)","USDOE Office of Energy Efficiency and Renewable Energy (EERE), Energy Efficiency Office.

The research topic of MLC in building energy systems is developing rapidly, but to our knowledge, no review has been published that specifically and systematically focuses on MLC for building energy systems. Here this paper provides a systematic review of MLC in building energy systems. We review technical papers in two major categories of applications of machine learning in building control: (1) building system and component modeling for control, and (2) control process learning. We identify MLC topics that have been well-studied and those that need further research in the field of building operation control. We also identify the gaps between the present and future application of MLC and predict future trends and opportunities.","Springer","","National Renewable Energy Lab.

"Reinforcement learning building control approach harnessing imitation learning","Dey, Sourav; Marzullo, Thibault; Zhang, Xiangyu; Henze, Gregor","32 ENERGY CONSERVATION, CONSUMPTION, AND UTILIZATION; 97 MATHEMATICS AND COMPUTING; artificial intelligence; building controls; imitation learning; reinforcement learning","Reinforcement learning (RL) has shown significant success in sequential decision making in fields like autonomous vehicles, robotics, marketing and gaming industries. This success has attracted the attention to the RL control approach for building energy systems which are becoming complicated due to the need to optimize for multiple, potentially conflicting, goals like occupant comfort, energy use and grid interactivity. However, for real world applications, RL has several drawbacks like requiring large training data and time, and unstable control behavior during the early exploration process making it infeasible for an application directly to building control tasks. To address these issues, an imitation learning approach is utilized herein where the RL agents starts with a policy transferred from accepted rule based policies and heuristic policies. This approach is successful in reducing the training time, preventing the unstable early exploration behavior and improving upon an accepted rule-based policy - all of these make RL a more practical control approach for real world applications in the domain of building controls.","Elsevier","","National Renewable Energy Lab.

"Machine learning–assisted prediction of heat fluxes through thermally anisotropic building envelopes","Shen, Zhenglai; Shrestha, Som; Howard, Daniel; Feng, Tianli; Hun, Diana E.; She, Buxin","32 ENERGY CONSERVATION, CONSUMPTION, AND UTILIZATION; Thermally anisotropic building envelope (TABE); Machine learning; Heat flux prediction; Building energy management","Thermally anisotropic building envelope (TABE) is a novel active building envelope that can save energy use to maintain thermal comfort in buildings by redirecting heat and coolness from building envelopes to thermal loops. Finite element models (FEMs) can be used to compute the heat fluxes through TABEs, but the high computational cost of finite element simulations has prevented parametric studies and design optimizations. This paper proposes a domain knowledge–informed, finite element–based machine learning framework to reduce the computation cost for the energy management of buildings installed with TABE that uses a ground thermal loop. First, the training heat flux data set was generated by FEM simulations with different thermal loop schedules. Then, both shallow learning models (i.e., multivariate linear regression and eXtreme Gradient Boost, or XGBoost) and a deep learning model (i.e., deep neural network, or DNN) were trained to predict the heat fluxes. Domain knowledge was used for data preprocessing and feature selection. Finally, the suitability of the selected machine learning model was tested under different thermal loop schedules. Herein, the case study results showed that: (1) XGBoost can be as accurate as DNN (coefficient of determination equal to 0.81) with much less training time; (2) the annual energy cost savings for different thermal loop schedules obtained by the XGBoost-predicted and FEM-calculated heat fluxes are consistent, having a difference of only 4%; and (3) XGBoost can reduce the computation time for the annual energy analysis of the case study building with a given thermal loop schedule from around 12 h by using FEM to less than 1 min.","Elsevier","","Oak Ridge National Lab.

The most common side reaction is the maleimide homopolymerization which introduces irreversible crosslinking in the network adversely affecting the recyclability. The main challenge is that the temperatures at which maleimide homopolymerization can occur are approximately the same as the temperatures at which retro-DA (rDA) reactions depolymerize the networks. Here we conducted detailed studies on three different strategies to minimize the effect of the side reaction. First, we controlled the ratio of maleimide to furan to reduce the concentration of maleimide groups which diminishes the effects of the side reaction. Second, we applied a radical-reaction inhibitor. Inclusion of hydroquinone, a known free radical scavenger, is found to retard the onset of the side reaction both in the temperature sweep and isothermal measurements. Finally, we employed a new trismaleimide precursor that has a lower maleimide concentration and reduces the rate of the side reaction. Our results provide insights into how to minimize formation of irreversible crosslinking by side reactions in reversible DA materials using maleimides, which is important for their application as novel self-healing, recyclable, and 3D-printable materials.</p>","MDPI AG","","New Mexico Inst. of Mining and Technology, Socorro, NM (United States)","USDOE Office of Science (SC), Basic Energy Sciences (BES)","","Switzerland","2023-02-23T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: Polymers Journal Volume: 15 Journal Issue: 5","","Medium: X; Size: Article No. 1106","","","SC0022261","Journal ID: ISSN 2073-4360; POLYCK; PII: polym15051106","10.3390/polym15051106","","2023-02-27T00:00:00Z","1958322","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/1958322","","Polymers","5","15"
"Community vulnerability is the key determinant of diverse energy burdens in the United States","Shen, Zhenglai; Chen, Chien-fei; Zhou, Hongyu; Fefferman, Nina; Shrestha, Som","32 ENERGY CONSERVATION, CONSUMPTION, AND UTILIZATION; energy burden; energy poverty; spatial analysis; COVID-19; community vulnerability","Low-income households generally experience a high energy burden; however, the factors influencing energy burdens are beyond socio-economics. This study explores the relationships between the multidimensionality of community vulnerability factors and energy burden across multiple geospatial levels in the United States. Our study found the distribution of energy burden in 2020 showed a great deal of variety, ranging from a minimum of 2.93 % to a maximum of 30.45 % across 3142 counties. The results of non-spatial and spatial regressions showed that the vulnerability ranks of socioeconomic, household composition and disability, minority and language, household type and transportation, and COVID mortality rate are significant predictors of energy burdens at the national level. However, at the regional level, only socioeconomic, minority and language significantly influence energy burdens. Minority and language negatively impact energy burdens except for the South East-Central region. Additionally, our analyses highlight the need to consider community vulnerability indicators' spatial homogeneity and heterogeneity. At the national level, only the epidemiological factors index is a spatially homogeneous predictor; on the regional and state level, the spatially homogeneous predictors such as socioeconomic status, household composition and disability, and household type and transportation vary by region. Such a region-sensitive relationship between energy burden and the predictors indicates spatial heterogeneity. Here this study suggests policy recommendations through the lens of the multidimensionality of community vulnerability factors. Implementing flexible national energy policies while making particular energy assistance policies for the vulnerable population at the regional or state levels is essential.","Elsevier","","Oak Ridge National Lab.

"Advanced biorefinery feedstock from non-recyclable municipal solid waste by mechanical preprocessing","Saha, Nepu; Klinger, Jordan; Islam, Md Tahmid; Reza, Toufiq","32 ENERGY CONSERVATION, CONSUMPTION, AND UTILIZATION; 09 BIOMASS FUELS; non-recyclable municipal solid waste; mechanical preprocessing; biorefinery feedstock; material variability; combustibility; higher heating value","<p>Because of accelerated urbanization and the development of a global economy, a large quantity of municipal solid waste (MSW) has been collected and disposed of by the municipalities. Due to this drastic increase in the disposal of MSW, the need for its management is a must to preserve the environment. Currently, approximately 50% of the total MSW generated in the United States has been utilized through various recycling, combustion, and composting technologies, which means the remaining 50% is sent to landfill; this is often known as non-recyclable MSW (nMSW). As this nMSW is physically and chemically heterogenous and contains very high amounts of inorganic material, processing is required prior to using it as a biorefinery feedstock. Thus, this study focused on how mechanical preprocessing advanced the physical and chemical properties of nMSW. The physical and chemical properties were investigated in terms of particle size distribution, bulk density, ultimate and proximate analysis, and the higher heating value (HHV). The combustion properties were examined in terms of ignition temperature, peak heat release rate, and combustion efficiency. Results showed that the variability of physical and chemical properties of nMSW can be reduced by mechanical preprocessing. For example, the variability of the bulk density of the as-received nMSW was approximately 17.3% while it reduced to 5.8% when the sample size was reduced to 2 mm. Similarly, the variability of ash and HHV reduced from 49.2% to 11.0% and 13.4%–4.2%, respectively. Combustion thermograms showed that the size reduction positively improved the combustion properties. For example, 2 mm of spec sample started to ignite approximately 4 times earlier and took 6.5 folds less time to reach the peak heating rate compared to as-received nMSW. Overall, the mechanical preprocessing reduced the variability of physical and chemical properties in addition to the improvement of combustion behavior of the nMSW which is one step forward toward the biorefinery feedstock.</p>","Frontiers Media SA","","Idaho National Lab.

However, synthetic fertilizers are made up of several macronutrients (nitrogen, phosphorus, and potassium), each with different energy intensities and environmental impacts. With the movement toward resource circularity, there is a need to create a more holistic view regarding the process energy associated with synthetic inorganic fertilizers, including nitrogen and phosphorus. Here, we first describe the growing production and consumption of inorganic (synthetic) and organic (animal waste) nutrients in agriculture as well as the process energy associated with the production of granular phosphorus and nitrogen-based fertilizers. Next, we present a projected global demand of nitrogen and phosphorus consumption based on various sustainability and societal equity scenarios to make an argument for the viability of nutrient recovery in addition to nutrient synthesis to meet this demand. Finally, we discuss the characteristics and challenges of emerging technologies for nutrient recovery along with a baseline of current operational recovery facilities.","American Chemical Society","","Ohio Univ., Athens, OH (United States)","USDOE Office of Energy Efficiency and Renewable Energy (EERE); Center for Advancing Sustainable and Distributed Fertilizer Production (CASFER)","","United States","2023-02-17T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: ACS Energy Letters Journal Volume: 8 Journal Issue: 3","","Medium: X; Size: p. 1493-1501","","","EE0009502; EEC-2133576","Journal ID: ISSN 2380-8195","10.1021/acsenergylett.2c02627","","2023-03-14T00:00:00Z","1957677","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/1957677","","ACS Energy Letters","3","8"
"Degradation of Insulating Glass Units: Thermal Performance, Measurements and Energy Impacts","Likins-White, Madison; Tenent, Robert C.; Zhai, Zhiqiang","32 ENERGY CONSERVATION, CONSUMPTION, AND UTILIZATION; degradation; energy consumption; glass; in-field measurement; thermal performance","Insulating glass unit (IGU) degradation has been studied extensively. However, there is limited understanding of how present durability evaluation standards relate to product lifetime. Furthermore, there is debate on how to quantify performance of installed windows over time to better understand degradation processes. More knowledge on these topics is required to link durability evaluation to product lifetime projections based on energy performance. Energy models provide helpful estimations of total annual building energy consumption. However, most models are based on “as installed” performance of envelope components and fail to account for performance degradation. This can lead to an underestimation of building lifetime energy consumption. A better understanding of the relationship between durability and energy performance can inform integration of degradation dynamics into energy modeling software. This will improve lifetime building energy consumption estimations as well as inform appropriate retrofit strategies and timing. This paper reviews current durability literature, various standards for window performance ratings and weathering methods, existing in situ IGU energy performance measurement techniques, and whole-building energy effects. The challenges and disparities among various studies are analyzed and discussed. The authors hope that further work in this area will lead to the development of improved in situ test methods to assess IGU degradation in the field and link this knowledge to improved energy performance modeling approaches.","MDPI","","National Renewable Energy Lab.

Specifically, we build and evaluate models using a small set of exogenous features (e.g., external temperature) to autoregressively predict zone airflow setpoints every minute for a 24-hour prediction window. We carefully explore the trade-off between generality and specificity in these models, training and evaluating them based on zone, zone type, month, season, and combinations thereof. When evaluated for a commercial office building in Eastern Washington with 16 zones served by variable air volume air handling units, we find that the highest performance comes from a zone-specific, season-agnostic approach; with it, we obtain an R<sup>2</sup> of 0.704 (averaged over zones) and an average normalized root mean square error (nRMSE) of 0.111. In contrast, the most general model (trained across all zones and seasons) yields an R<sup>2</sup> of only 0.416 and a nRMSE of 0.168, while a baseline zone-specific reduced order model obtains 0.443 R<sup>2</sup> and 0.159 nRMSE. We also report on factors affecting airflow forecasting performance, on the ability of models trained on a specific zone to generalize to other zones, and on the capability of those models trained on a specific month to generalize to other months.","Elsevier","","Pacific Northwest National Lab.

To explore the marketability of recycled FPP, four down-stream market pathways were studied, including roof coverboard, plastic pellets, pallets, and film. In this work, results indicated that (1) the cleaning and pelletizing process at reclaimers contributed the most to the total greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions of recycled FPP products, and (2) the GHG emissions of recycled FPP products in all four pathways are lower than the comparator products. Therefore, using a higher percentage of recycled FPP substituted in a product can result in greater GHG emission reductions. All the recycled FPP products also showed favorable economics compared to their direct competitors.","Elsevier","","Idaho National Lab.

An accurate community-scale energy model is useful for evaluating the use of limited capital resources used to invest in clean energy technologies. This work lays out the process of developing such a model while relying primarily on publicly available data and highlighting critical partnerships necessary for model development success. The primary contribution of this work is the demonstration of the process used to develop an accurate energy model for a disadvantaged community when minimal building and energy use data is available. The heart of the model is the physics-based community scale energy modeling platform URBANopt. Using a bottom-up load modeling approach, energy simulated energy use falls within 3% or less of aggregate annual utility data, and within 10% or less aggregate monthly utility data. The demonstrated model development and tuning process can be used by others to characterize other atypical communities, which may differ significantly from prototypical models.","Elsevier","","National Renewable Energy Lab.

As urban centers continue to grow, the popularity of glass as cladding material in urban buildings is an alarming trend. Dynamic windows reduce heating and cooling loads in buildings by passive heating in cold seasons and mitigating solar heat gain in hot seasons. Here, reduced energy consumption in highly glazed buildings in a mesoscopic building energy model is demonstrated when thermochromic windows are employed. Savings are realized across eight disparate climate zones of the United States. The model is used to determine ideal critical transition temperatures of 20-27.5 °C for thermochromic windows based on metal halide perovskite materials. Ideal transition temperatures are realized experimentally in composite metal halide perovskite films composed of perovskite crystals and an adjacent reservoir phase. The transition temperature is controlled by cointercalating methanol, instead of water, with methylammonium iodide and tailoring the hydrogen-bonding chemistry of the reservoir phase. Thermochromic windows based on metal halide perovskites represent a clear opportunity to mitigate the effects of energy-hungry buildings.","Wiley Blackwell (John Wiley & Sons)","","National Renewable Energy Lab.

"Impact of different roofing mitigation strategies on near-surface temperature and energy consumption over the Chicago metropolitan area during a heatwave event","Tan, Haochen; Kotamarthi, Rao; Wang, Jiali; Qian, Yun; Chakraborty, T. C.","32 ENERGY CONSERVATION, CONSUMPTION, AND UTILIZATION; heatwave; rooftops; cooling energy demand; urban climate modeling","This study examined the impact of cool roofs, green roofs, and solar panel roofs on near-surface temperature and cooling energy demand through regional modeling in the Chicago metropolitan area (CMA). The new parameterization of green roofs and solar panel roofs based on model physics has recently been developed, updated, and coupled to a multilayer building energy model that is fully integrated with the Weather Research and Forecasting model. We evaluate the model performance against with observation measurements to show that our model is capable of being a suited tool to simulate the heatwave event. Next, we examine the impact by characterizing the near-surface air temperature and its diurnal cycle from experiments with and without the different rooftops. We also estimate the impact of the rooftop on the urban island intensity (UHII), surface heat flux, and the boundary layer. Finally, we measure the impact of the different rooftops on citywide air-conditioning consumption. Results show that the deployment of the cool roof can reduce the near-surface temperature most over urban areas, followed by green roof and solar panel roof. The cool roof experiment was the only one where the near-surface temperature trended down as the urban fraction increased, indicating the cool roof is the most effective mitigation strategy among these three rooftop options. For cooling energy consumption, it can be reduced by 16.6 %, 14.0 %, and 7.6 %, when cool roofs, green roofs, and solar panel roofs are deployed, respectively. Although solar panel roofs show the smallest reduction in energy consumption, if we assume that all electricity production can be applied to cooling demand, we can expect almost a savings of almost half (46.7 %) on cooling energy demand.","Elsevier","","Argonne National Lab.

The models assume that the PCMs are in perfect operating condition and underestimate the impact of actual phase change behavior (e.g., enthalpy curve shape) on thermal load shifting in practical deployment. In this paper, we bridge the gap between theory and practice when evaluating the energy impact of PCMs by using a model-driven approach to develop durable thermal energy storage materials with desired phase change properties. For ease of integration, we fabricate shape-stabilized PCMs (ss-PCMs) by encapsulating solid-liquid polyethylene glycol (PEG) consisting of different molecular weights within mesoporous magnesium oxide (MgO) matrices. Learning from the modeling results, we manipulate phase change properties such as peak melting temperature and temperature glide of PEG-MgO ss-PCMs during the synthesis process to achieve desired properties. As such, the energy density is maximized within the optimum operating temperature range, which is critical to boosting energy efficiency. Compared to a case with no PCM, a layer of PEG-MgO ss-PCM integrated into the wall provides a 50% reduction in the peak load and also exhibits a repeatable phase change behavior for up to 1000 thermal cycles without leakage, showing durability of this material. We also show that this lab-scale synthesis process is easy to be scaled up by 100 times for a demonstration of large-scale industrial production. The synthetic tunability of transition temperature of ss-PCMs also extends their applicability beyond buildings.","Elsevier","","National Renewable Energy Lab.

"Linear Viscoelastic Properties of Putative Cyclic Polymers Synthesized by Reversible Radical Recombination Polymerization (R3P)","Chen, Dongjie; Molnar, Kristof; Kim, Hojin; Helfer, Carin A.; Kaszas, Gabor; Puskas, Judit E.; Kornfield, Julia A.; McKenna, Gregory B.","36 MATERIALS SCIENCE; 42 ENGINEERING; 32 ENERGY CONSERVATION, CONSUMPTION, AND UTILIZATION; Polymer; Macrocyclic Polymer; Rheology; Molecular Weight Dependence; Entanglement Density; Viscosity; Dynamic Moduli; Concentration Dependence; Steady State Recoverable Compliance","Linear viscoelastic properties in both melt and solution states are reported for a series of poly(3,6-dioxa-1,8-octanedithiol) (polyDODT) made by reversible radical recombination polymerization (R<sub>3</sub>P) under conditions designed to produce linear (LDODT), cyclic (RDODT) and linear-cyclic mixtures (LRDODT). PolyDODT is amorphous (T<sub>g</sub>< -50 °C) and highly flexible (entanglement molecular weight M<sub>e,lin</sub> ≈ 1850 g/mol for LDODT). PolyDODT’s low T<sub>g</sub> and low M<sub>e,lin</sub> enable characterization over a wide dynamic range and a wide range of dimensionless weight-average molecular weight Z<sub>w</sub> = M<sub>w</sub>/M<sub>e,lin</sub>. Measurements at temperatures from -57 °C to 100 °C provide up to 18 deades of reduced frequency, which is necessary to characterize RDODT melts with Z<sub>w</sub> from 23 to 300. The two highest molecular weight polymers in the present RDODT series have such high M<sub>w</sub> (406k and 556k g/mol) that mass spectrometry, NMR spectroscopy, and even chemical assays for chain ends are unable to rule out up to 2 mol% linear contaminant. By studying the samples in solution (using dilution to reduce Z<sub>w</sub>) we could compare their dynamics with those of previously established high-purity polystyrene (PS) rings (limited to Z<sub>w</sub> ≤ 13.6). RDODT solutions with Z<sub>w</sub> < 15 (concentrations <5wt% for RDODT-406k and 556k) have dynamic moduli G^* that accord with LCCC-purified PS rings in terms of the frequency dependence (including the absence of a plateau), the progression of shapes of G* as a function of Z<sub>w</sub>, and the linear scaling of their zero-shear viscosity η0 with M<sub>w</sub>. The shape of G* as a function of Z<sub>w</sub> for solutions of RDODT-406k and -556k also accord with lower M<sub>w</sub> RDODT melts (which have ≤ 1.3mol% linear contaminant). Thus, measurement of the linear viscoelastic properties of appropriate concentrations of high M<sub>w</sub> (>200k g/mol) putative cyclic polymers, in which linear chains evade spectroscopic detection, may provide an alternative means (though not fully proven) of validation of sample purity. When Z<sub>w</sub> > 15 (including all seven RDODT melts and eight of their solutions), G* has a rubbery plateau. This suggests that the onset of entanglement-like behavior in rings requires 4-5-fold greater Z<sub>w</sub> than is required for linear chains. Further, the plateau moduli of RDODT samples are indistinguishable from G<sub>N<sup>o</sup></sub> of the corresponding LDODT (melt or matched-concentration solutions). In entangled linear polymers, the observation that G<sub>N<sup>o</sup></sub> is independent of Z<sub>w</sub> follows from limitations on lateral fluctuations due to neighboring chains becoming independent of position along a given chain. The present results for RDODT suggest that this holds for sufficiently long endless chains, too. While the RDODT have the same G<sub>N<sup>o</sup></sub> as entangled LDODT, when Z<sub>w</sub> > 60 the terminal relaxation, if reached at all, of RDODT extends to orders of magnitude lower frequency than an entangled linear polymer of the same Z<sub>w</sub>. Consequently, the viscosity of RDODT with Z<sub>w</sub> > 60 increases with Z<sub>w</sub> much more strongly than the 3.4-power observed for entangled linear polymers. Lastly, these novel polymers, with disulfide-linked backbone and broad relaxation time distribution may prove important in relation to biodegradable elastomers and materials with exceptional low-frequency dissipation, extending at least 12 decades below the onset of the rubbery plateau.","American Chemical Society","","Texas Tech Univ., Lubbock, TX (United States)","USDOE Office of Science (SC), Basic Energy Sciences (BES)","","United States","2023-01-29T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: Macromolecules; Related Information: Supplemental Information to the main manuscript. https://pubs.acs.org/doi/10.1021/acs.macromol.2c00892?goto=supporting-info&ref=pdf","","Medium: ED","","","SC0018657; SC0018655; DC0018891","Journal ID: ISSN 0024-9297","10.1021/acs.macromol.2c00892","","2023-02-08T00:00:00Z","1923241","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/1923241","","Macromolecules","",""

Chemical etching was applied on the cenospheres to create holes through which melted PCM was loaded to produce a PCM microcapsule. Subsequently, a silica-based coating was applied to seal the perforations and prevent leakage of PCM from the microcapsule. Microstructural, chemical compatibility, thermal, and leakage properties of the produced silica coated PCM microcapsule (SCPCM) were assessed. No leakage was found for this new microcapsule, and higher thermal stability and conductivity were noted. Thermal decomposition of the PCM in SCPCM was delayed by about 16 degrees C attributable to the silica coating. Additionally, an enhanced compressive strength performance was achieved at 10 vol% of sand replacement with SCPCM. 20-30 vol% replacement of sand with cenosphere microcapsules seems to be the optimal range for reasonable compressive strength. The workability of the mortar incorporated with SCPCM decreased when the replacement level increased to more than 30 vol% due to the hydrophilic nature of the silica deposit. This study has demonstrated the potential of cenospheres as inorganic shell for PCMs and the potential for incorporation of SCPCM into construction materials for thermal energy storage (TES).","Elsevier","","National Renewable Energy Lab.

"Long-term carbon intensity reduction potential of K-12 school buildings in the United States","Yang, Yizhi; Lou, Yingli; Payne, Chris; Ye, Yunyang; Zuo, Wangda","32 ENERGY CONSERVATION, CONSUMPTION, AND UTILIZATION; building energy simulation; carbon intensity reduction; K-12 school building; large-scale simulation","School buildings have a great potential for carbon emission reduction since their annual emission is about 72 million metric tons. Currently, more than 30% of school buildings were built before 1960 and are underperforming. To effectively reduce carbon emissions via school building retrofits, it is critical for policymakers to understand the carbon intensity reduction potential of retrofitting school buildings in different regions. Hence, this study develops a method to comprehensively assess the long-term carbon intensity reduction potential of aggregated commercial buildings on a county-by-county basis in the continental U.S. We apply this method to the K-12 school buildings including primary and secondary school buildings. Here, this paper predicts the carbon intensity reduction potential of K-12 school buildings with eight building retrofit measures from 2022 to 2050 in the continental U.S. The results reveal several interesting findings: (1) In the approximately 3,000 counties of the U.S. from 2022 to 2050, the carbon intensity reduction potential of retrofitting K-12 school buildings in each county ranges from 0.41 kg/m<sup>2</sup> to 40.00 kg/m<sup>2</sup>. (2) Even in the same climate zone, the trends of carbon intensity reduction potential from 2022 to 2050 are different depending on their electricity sources. For example, in a hot and humid climate zone, the carbon intensity reduction potential in Florida will decrease from 2044 to 2048. However, in Mississippi, the carbon intensity reduction potential from 2044 to 2046 will increase due to the termination of the nuclear energy usage. (3) Generally, reducing lighting power density leads to more carbon intensity reduction in most states, but it might not be applicable for states with high clean energy penetration, such as Washington.","Elsevier","","National Renewable Energy Lab.

However, there is a large potential for energy savings in determining the periods when the systems should or should not be active. This scheduling aspect of operation is often overlooked even though relatively simple solutions can unlock substantial energy savings. In this paper we describe a smart building start (SBS) algorithm that considers multiple zones in a building to determine individual schedules for room controllers as well as the central systems based on solving a simple optimization problem. Application of the SBS algorithm to multiple interconnected systems enables a staggered start-up that minimizes peak loads and also ensures comfort is within a target range with minimal system run time. The SBS algorithm extends the capability of traditional optimal start and is designed to be simple to deploy and robust. Simulation results as well as results from tests in a real building with a VAV system are presented. The presented algorithm is applicable to any type of building with a zonal or multi-zone HVAC system.

"A new control score concept for building performance assessment","Salsbury, Timothy I.; Rogers, Austin P.; Yoder, Tim A.; Johnson, Stephanie R.; Duan, Xiaoli","32 ENERGY CONSERVATION, CONSUMPTION, AND UTILIZATION; building control score; control performance assessment; supervisory control; building energy use; HVAC systems","In buildings, performance assessment often focuses on energy use with metrics such as energy use intensity (EUI) used to benchmark performance. However, energy performance of a building is fundamentally determined by the control system that engages the energy-using systems. There are two aspects of control that are of particular importance: (1) the ability to regulate process variables to their setpoints; and (2) whether the setpoints are at the right levels and/or following desired profiles. Most buildings do not reach their energy efficiency potential due to deficiencies in control performance and operators do not have access to metrics that can illuminate these deficiencies. Here this paper addresses this problem by providing novel techniques that combine these two aspects of control performance into a single standardized score on the scale of 0-10. The concept of a standardized control scores enables all systems in a building to be compared on the same scale and also for scores to be rolled up to different levels in the building and system hierarchy for system-wide analysis. The paper presents the theory for the method, describes a prototype tool for displaying scores, and presents results from application to a large building in Minneapolis.","Elsevier","","Pacific Northwest National Lab.

"Empirical Study of the Effect of Thermal Loading on the Heating Efficiency of Variable-Speed Air Source Heat Pumps","Marsik, Tom; Stevens, Vanessa; Garber-Slaght, Robbin; Dennehy, Conor; Strunk, Robby Tartuilnguq; Mitchell, Alan","32 ENERGY CONSERVATION, CONSUMPTION, AND UTILIZATION; air source heat pump; coefficient of performance; efficiency","Heating buildings with air source heat pumps (ASHPs) has the potential to save energy compared to utilizing conventional heat sources. Accurate understanding of the efficiency of ASHPs is important to maximize the energy savings. While it is well understood that, in general, ASHP efficiency decreases with decreasing outdoor temperature, it is not well understood how the ASHP efficiency changes with different levels of thermal loading, even though it is an important consideration for sizing and controlling ASHPs. The goal of this study was to create an empirical model of the ASHP efficiency as a function of two independent variables–outside temperature and level of thermal loading. Four ductless mini-split ASHPs were evaluated in a cold chamber where the temperature (representing the outdoor temperature) was varied over a wide range. For each temperature, the ASHP performance data were collected at several levels of thermal loading. The data for all four ASHPs were combined and approximated with an analytical function that can be used as a general model for the ASHP steady-state efficiency as a function of the outside temperature and level of thermal loading. To the knowledge of the authors, no such empirical model that is solely based on third-party test data has been published before. While limitations exist, the model can be used to help guide future selection and operation of ASHPs.","MDPI","","National Renewable Energy Lab.

"Simulation-based assessment on stochastic load scheduling for building cooling systems","Huang, Sen; Huang, Bowen; Katipamula, Srinivas; Ma, Xu","32 ENERGY CONSERVATION, CONSUMPTION, AND UTILIZATION; building cooling system; demand response; stochastic load scheduling; uncertainty","Here, to fill knowledge gaps related to stochastic load scheduling, we performed a comprehensive evaluation of the stochastic load scheduling for building cooling systems. Specifically, we studied the common uncertain variables in the load scheduling process for building cooling systems and categorized those variables based on their dynamic patterns. We then developed a generic stochastic load scheduling framework and applied it to building cooling systems that served a simulated community. This community consists of 100 heterogeneous houses and serves as a virtual testbed for evaluating the performance of stochastic load scheduling. In this evaluation, we considered representatives of uncertain variables with different dynamic patterns and included 100 realizations of the considered uncertainty in the evaluation to better catch the probability distribution of the control performance. The evaluation results suggest that deterministic load scheduling can reduce the operating energy cost by 18% but its performance can be affected by uncertainty. Stochastic load scheduling can further decrease the operating energy cost under uncertainty compared to deterministic load scheduling. We also found that the effectiveness of stochastic load scheduling in handling uncertainty is not directly associated with the number of uncertainty scenarios that are considered in its formulation.","Taylor & Francis","","Oak Ridge National Lab.

"Atomistic insights into the heat conductance across the interfaces between erythritol and different metals: A non-equilibrium molecular dynamics study","Feng, Biao; Liu, Jia; Zeng, Yi; Fan, Li-Wu","32 ENERGY CONSERVATION, CONSUMPTION, AND UTILIZATION; interfacial contact ratio; interfacial heat conductance; lattice vibrations; molecular dynamics; polyol phase change material","The heat conductance across the interface between a phase change material (PCM) and the metal shell is important for thermal design of latent heat storage systems. Non-equilibrium molecular dynamics simulations were carried out in this work to unravel, at the atomistic level, the interfacial heat conductance mechanisms between erythritol (the most promising medium-temperature polyol PCM) and two different metals (i.e., copper and aluminum). The interfacial contact ratio was introduced as a parameter to represent different contact conditions at the interfaces, for example, different surface roughness levels of the metals. It was found that with the increase of interfacial contact ratio, the temperature difference between the erythritol/metal interfaces decreases, whereas the interfacial heat transfer coefficient increases gradually. At the perfect contact condition, i.e., the interfacial contact ratio reaches 100%, the interfacial heat transfer coefficients across the erythritol/Cu and erythritol/Al interfaces were predicted to be 398 ± 26 MW/m<sup>2</sup>K and 544 ± 11 MW/m<sup>2</sup>K, respectively. The interfacial heat conductance of erythritol/Al is better than that of erythritol/Cu. The mismatch of atomic spectral density across the interfaces between erythritol and the two metals was analyzed and distinguished. These results could guide the selection of packaging materials and the thermal design of erythritol-based latent heat storage systems.","Elsevier","","National Renewable Energy Lab.

"Review of liquid desiccant air dehumidification systems coupled with heat pump: System configurations, component design, and performance","Venegas, Tomas; Qu, Ming; Wang, Lingshi; Liu, Xiaobing; Gluesenkamp, Kyle; Gao, Zhiming","32 ENERGY CONSERVATION, CONSUMPTION, AND UTILIZATION; air dehumidification; liquid desiccant dehumidification; heat pump","Vapor Compression Systems (VCS) are the most common air conditioning technology. VCS cool the air to its dew point temperature (overcooling) to remove water vapor in the air through condensation and then reheats the air back to the comfort temperature for direct use. The VCS process is inefficient due to overcooling and reheating. Liquid Desiccant Dehumidification (LDD) is a potentially energy-efficient air conditioning. LDD removes water vapor in the process air using liquid desiccant’s high-water affinity. It hybrids with sensible cooling to control temperature and humidity separately. The LD in the LDD becomes weak after dehumidification. The LDD needs additional heating to regenerate the weak Liquid Desiccant (LD) to a high concentration for dehumidification. Earlier versions of the LDD systems use highly concentrated liquid desiccant (large water removal capability) to dehumidify the air by only dealing with latent load. It leads to highly elevated temperatures above 60 °C of heat sources (combustion or electric resistance-based heating) for regeneration. The energy needed for the elevated temperature heat resource significantly reduces or demolishes the benefit of LDD systems. In the recent two decades, researchers have investigated a new configured LDD system that couples an LDD with a heat pump at both dehumidification and regeneration sides for better efficiency. The heat pump provides cooling (from the evaporator) for both dehumidification and sensible cooling and simultaneous heating from the condenser for regeneration. The highly integrated system (HP-LDD) with improved efficiency enables the LDD to operate at lower concentrations and temperatures in dehumidification and regeneration. This paper depicts the working principle behind HP-LDD and its heating and cooling requirements. It reviews the comparison between the HP-LDD systems and the conventional LDD systems regarding system configurations, component design, energy efficiency, and dehumidification performance characteristics. The main findings from the review include the preferred use of packed bed over membrane-based dehumidifiers, the use of internally cooled dehumidifiers enabled by the HP cooling capacity, the high dispersion of HP operation conditions, and the dependence of dehumidification performance on various dehumidifiers. Finally, an outlook for future research on HP-LDD strategies is presented based on the reviewed works and their limitations.","Elsevier","","Oak Ridge National Lab.

However, a comprehensive understanding of where and how these window technologies can be installed to enable optimal energy savings under different climate conditions remains limited. Here we test window technologies using thousands of macroscale building-energy simulations for different climate zones and building designs to evaluate the associated net energy use and carbon-emissions reduction potential. Novel window technologies, especially photovoltaic windows with high thermal performance, offer energy savings in all climates, ranging from 10,000-40,000 GJ per year over substandard windows for a typical office building, resulting in up to 2,000 tons of annual CO<sub>2</sub> emissions reduction.

The proposed method uses probabilistic collocation method (PCM) to approximate the results of grid strength assessment under uncertain renewable generation, in order to reduce the computational burden without compromising the result accuracy when compared with traditional Monte Carlo simulation (MCS). To improve the accuracy of the approximation results, the proposed method integrates the K-means clustering technique with PCM to select the approximation samples of input variables.

"The impact of energy-efficiency upgrades and other distributed energy resources on a residential neighborhood-scale electrification retrofit","Earle, Lieko; Maguire, Jeff; Munankarmi, Prateek; Roberts, David","32 ENERGY CONSERVATION, CONSUMPTION, AND UTILIZATION; buildings; decarbonization; demand flexibility; distributed energy resources; electrification; residential community; retrofit","We report ambitious targets for carbon emissions reductions are highlighting new challenges for electrification strategies, leading to an increased focus on building load flexibility and energy management to complement the variability inherent in renewable energy generation. Over the next decade millions of existing homes could undergo electrification retrofits, and there is an urgent need to understand the potential impacts of electrifying major residential loads such as water and space heating on community load characteristics, resident energy bills, and the utility's distribution system. Behind-the-meter distributed energy resources (DERs), including efficiency measures, photovoltaics (PV), battery storage, managed electric vehicle (EV) charging, and controls such as home energy management systems (HEMS), can significantly alter a neighborhood's load profile and provide benefits to both the residents and the grid. We present a novel approach to characterizing the impact of a hypothetical neighborhood-scale residential retrofit program on individual homes' energy use profiles, associated utility bills, and the local distribution system. We modeled a mixed-fuel community of 30 single-family homes in Denver, Colorado, and compared the effects of retrofit scenarios ranging from conventional energy-efficiency upgrades to full electrification with and without more advanced DER technologies. We analyzed which packages of DERs most reliably enable demand flexibility in response to a time-of-use (TOU) rate for this and similar neighborhoods. Our buildings-to-grid co-simulation framework includes a generic secondary distribution feeder model to capture voltage profiles, transformer loading, and other grid impacts in each case. We also calculated the carbon emissions associated with energy use in the community. The methodology developed here can be broadly applied to community-scale beneficial electrification studies in other regions, climates, utility infrastructures, and building typologies to make specific, targeted recommendations based on quantified projections of energy demand in any given community. Our findings indicate that residential electrification can be achieved without negatively impacting the monthly utility bill, and that a combination of conventional energy-efficiency measures, PV, battery, controls, and managed EV charging to maximize a community's demand flexibility is a promising strategy. Adding DERs (especially PV) as part of efficient electrification produces much bigger savings than efficient electrification without DERs. A key barrier is that upgrades require upfront costs, and modest utility bill savings result in long payback periods.","Elsevier","","National Renewable Energy Lab.

"How will United States commercial building energy use be impacted by IPCC climate scenarios?","Bass, Brett; New, Joshua","32 ENERGY CONSERVATION, CONSUMPTION, AND UTILIZATION; Building energy modeling; Climate change; Building energy use; Carbon dioxide emissions","Climate change and anthropogenically-forced shift of weather in the future will impact energy use and resilience of both the built environment and the electric grid. The aim of this analysis is to understand how future climate scenarios will impact electricity and natural gas use of commercial buildings in the United States. Here, this study analyzes this impact for 2030, 2045, and 2100 using Representative Concentration Pathways (RCP) scenarios defined in Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) Assessment Report 5. The large, gridded simulation of meteorological variables for RCPs 2.6, 4.5, 6.0, and 8.5 are selected and downscaled to make available hourly Future Meteorological Year (FMY) weather files for use and improvement in subsequent studies. High performance computing resources use these FMYs to simulate commercial prototype buildings in every American Society of Heating, Refrigeration, and Air Conditioning Engineers (ASHRAE) climate zone of the United States (US), and results are scaled to nation-wide energy use using conditioned floor area multipliers. The analysis is conducted without speculating the physical and performance traits of future buildings or the grid characteristics. This analysis quantifies the impact of climate change on source electrical and natural gas usage for commercial buildings in the United States over the next 80 years. If US commercial floorspace remained constant, total energy use by 2100 is predicted between an 1.75% decrease under the greatest emission scenario (8.5) and a 1.76% increase under the lowest emission scenario (2.6). When adjusted for anticipated urban growth by 2100, the predicted range is 65% increase (8.5) and 71% increase (2.6). Under a global temperature rise climate scenario, the warmest US climate zones will see a large increases in electricity use derived from space cooling while the coldest US climate zones will see significant decreases in natural gas use caused by the decrease in heating necessary. While climate change may ultimately require adaptations of the built environment to withstand its effects and because the United States is a country that requires more heating than cooling, from a building energy perspective, climate change (average temperature rise) is a net energy saver for the United States.","Elsevier","","Oak Ridge National Lab.

This work fills this gap by presenting an experimental study that quantifies the effects of DR on building energy efficiency. Unlike existing studies, this work 1) investigates the uncertainty levels when assessing the effects of DR; 2) studies the impact of rooftop heat pumps with direct expansion refrigerant-to-air coils on the round-trip efficiency. Specifically, we considered a medium office building (~1860 m<sup>2</sup>), which is served by rooftop units, located in eastern Washington State. We performed preheating control tests during typical heating days in the year 2022 and compared the building’s energy consumption during the testing days to that during normal operation days under similar weather conditions. To understand how well those normal operation days represent the baseline for the assessment, the relationship between the energy performance of this building and weather conditions was also studied. Experimental results reveal that the round-trip efficiency (i.e., the ratio of discharging energy output from the building to charging energy input into the building) was between 0.16 and 0.92. The results show that significant energy loss may occur during the preheating process. Finally, it also suggests a significant correlation between the energy efficiency of the studied building under the preheating control and the outdoor temperature; and a highly nonlinear relationship between the zone temperature changing rate and the weather condition.","Elsevier","","Oak Ridge National Lab.

To this end, novel computational modeling techniques have been developed and applied to acquire knowledge crucial for accelerating the pace of M–N–C catalyst development. In this review, recent progress in computational method development, as well as the predictions of chemical structure of active sites, reaction pathways, ORR kinetics, and catalyst stability in electrochemical environments, are critically surveyed. Moreover, the crucial role of computational modeling to elucidate the functional mechanism of M–N–C catalysts for ORR in acid media and enable rational design of M–N–C catalysts is discussed with a visionary outlook for the field.","Royal Society of Chemistry","","Los Alamos National Lab.

"Toward energy-efficient industrial thermal systems for regional manufacturing facilities","Kapp, Sean; Choi, Jun-Ki; Kissock, Kelly","32 ENERGY CONSERVATION, CONSUMPTION, AND UTILIZATION; Industrial energy efficiency; Energy audits; Thermal systems; Energy economics; Input–output analysis","As large energy consumers, manufacturing facilities have considerable potential to increase their energy efficiency by improving processes and protocols. Energy audits can identify such opportunities that supply facilities with technical information and economic context for implementing a given improvement. This work utilized industrial energy-efficient thermal systems data achieved from 220 industrial energy auditing performed in the past ten years. Engineering models are developed to calculate the energy savings and emission reductions for each energy efficiency recommendations. In addition, economic and environmental benefits of the energy auditing program are presented not only at the factory level but also at the localities level by integrating a macro-economic model and the results from the engineering analysis. This article focuses on energy efficiency recommendations regarding thermal systems, encompassing such areas as heat reclamation and containment, steam systems, and chillers. It details several case studies of energy-efficient recommendations that represent a larger set of 93 recommendations made out of 343 thermal systems recommendations implemented during the period and quantifies the economic impacts of these implementations and corresponding investments through an economic input–output analysis. The results demonstrate that energy audits can be an effective means not only to save energy but to produce high-impact and high-value investments. The finding that the implemented recommendations created direct, indirect, and induced economic impacts whose benefits extended far beyond the cost of implementation has significant implications for the manufacturing industry and local, regional, and national policymakers.","Elsevier","","University of Dayton, OH (United States)","USDOE","","United States","2022-11-01T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: Energy Reports Journal Volume: 8 Journal Issue: C","","Medium: X; Size: p. 1377-1387","","","EE0007710","Journal ID: ISSN 2352-4847; S2352484721014992; PII: S2352484721014992","10.1016/j.egyr.2021.12.060","","2022-01-03T00:00:00Z","1837846","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/1837846","","Energy Reports","C","8"

Nuclear-renewable integrated energy system (NR-IES) concepts are a leading solution that couples a nuclear power plant with renewable energy, hydrogen generation plants, and energy storage systems, such that thermal and electrical power are dispatchable to fulfill grid-flexibility requirements while also producing hydrogen and maximizing revenue. Here, this paper introduces a deep reinforcement learning (DRL)-based framework to address the complex decision-making tasks for NR-IES. The objective is to maximize revenue by generating and selling hydrogen and electricity simultaneously according to their time-varying prices while keeping the energy flow in the subsystems in balance. A Python-based simulator for a NR-IES concept has been developed to integrate with OpenAI Gym and Ray/RLlib to enable an efficient and flexible computational framework for DRL research and development. Three state-of-the-art DRL algorithms have been investigated, including two-delayed deep deterministic policy gradient (TD3), soft-actor critic (SAC), proximal policy optimization (PPO), to illustrate DRL’s superiority for controlling NR-IES by comparing it with a conventional control approach, particle swarm optimization (PSO). In this effort, PPO has shown more-stable performance and also better generalization capability than SAC and TD3. Comparisons with PSO have demonstrated that, on average, PPO can achieve 13.9% more mean episode returns from the training process and 29.4% more mean episode returns from the testing process when different hydrogen-production targets are applied.","Elsevier","","Idaho National Lab.

The effect of alloying element on the initial hydrogenation kinetics of TiFe alloys, TiFe<sub>0.9</sub>M<sub>0.1</sub> (M = V, Cr, Fe, Co and Ni), was evaluated by analyzing changes to the passivating surface oxide layer that inhibits hydrogen permeation, as well as the ease of initial-stage hydrogen absorption into the underlying matrix. X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy and atom probe tomography revealed key variations in surface oxide compositions and thinning of the passivating oxide layer compared to pure TiFe, which suggests suppressed oxide growth by alloying-induced elemental redistribution. At the same time, density functional theory calculations predicted exothermic formation of hydride nuclei when alloying with V or Cr, as well as a reduced nucleation barrier when alloying with Co or Ni. Overall, these results are consistent with the observed experimental trend of the activation kinetics. We propose that improvements in activation kinetics of TiFe with alloying arises from the combined effect of reduced passivating oxide thickness and easier hydride nucleation, offering a starting point for alloy design strategies towards further improvement.","","External Audience (Unlimited)","Lawrence Livermore National Lab.

"A Framework to Predict Variability Characteristics in Building Load Profiles","Moayedi, Sam; Parker, Andrew; James, Kevin; Cheng, Xiaoyue; Hempel, Michael; Sharif, Hamid; Alahmad, Mahmoud A.","32 ENERGY CONSERVATION, CONSUMPTION, AND UTILIZATION; building load profile modeling; decomposition; DWT; regression; variability prediction","The expansion of Advanced Metering Infrastructure (AMI) has provided building operators and researchers detailed information on building energy consumption. The majority of AMI systems, however, record data at relatively low resolutions of 15, 30, or 60 minutes, due to cost, storage and bandwidth limitations. Emerging applications in power flow analysis, Quasi-Static Time-Series Simulation (QSTS), smart grid integration and load matching, however, require data at higher resolutions. Short-term energy demand can deviate significantly from long-term averages, with an unknown magnitude and frequency when only low-resolution load profile data is available. This paper presents a novel data-driven approach to predict characteristics of the missing high-resolution information in a low-resolution signal, applicable to both measured and modeled building load profile data, utilizing machine learning regression algorithms. In the proposed framework, the relationship between characteristics of high-resolution and low-resolution signals is learned from the decomposition and characterization of a subset of high-resolution building data. This paper validates the underlying hypotheses and methodology of this approach through a single-building case study, training a variety of machine learning models on one year of data, and using the resulting models to predict high-resolution characteristics in a different year. An Ensemble Tree regression model demonstrates a high predictive accuracy (R<sup>2</sup> of 0.79-0.92) for several statistical metrics of the high-resolution load profile. These results support the broader potential for leveraging low-resolution information to accurately constrain predictions of missing high-resolution information in building load profiles, which may greatly increase the utility of both measured and modeled data in many practical and research applications. Generalizing such models will require analysis of high-resolution data from a diverse set of building types.","Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers","","National Renewable Energy Lab.

Herein, latticed-confined conversion chemistry is proposed, where the “intercalation-like” redox behavior is realized on the electrode with a “conversion-like” high capacity. By delicately formulating the high-entropy compounds, the pristine crystal structure can be preserved by the inert lattice framework, thus enabling an ultra-high initial Coulombic efficiency of 92.5% and a long cycling lifespan over a thousand cycles after the quasistatic charge–discharge cycle.

This study investigates the benefits and limitations of implementing radiative coatings on the building envelope, particularly the roof, of residential buildings in the United States. The analysis compares the performance of an ideal radiative coating with broadband surface properties to a realistic radiative coating with diffuse and semitransparent properties. To enhance the net energy efficiency of buildings, we carried out a comprehensive parametric analysis comprising key radiation surface properties to maximize cooling energy savings while minimizing heating energy penalties. A countrywide assessment for 68 locations across the United States showed that net energy savings are a strong function of the climatic and atmospheric conditions. Broadly, southern locations showed high overall energy savings whereas northern locations exhibited high overall energy penalties. Locations in International Energy Conservation Code (IECC) climate zones 1A, 2A, and 2B showed a net annual energy savings above 5%, whereas locations in IECC climate zones 5B, 6B, and 7 showed a net annual energy penalty greater than 3%. The hot and dry climate of Phoenix, Arizona, showed the highest overall energy savings of 426 kWh (6.2%). Additionally, the mathematical correlation reveals that the net energy savings of a location is positive only when its average cooling degree days is greater than 5.5 or its average heating degree days is less than 10.","Elsevier","","National Renewable Energy Lab.

The AMRR used to cool from 285 K to 135 K has two identical regenerators fabricated with adjacent layers of four ferromagnetic refrigerants, each with sequentially lower Curie temperatures and lesser masses from hot to cold temperatures. The dual multilayer regenerators were assembled in opposition with a single cold region between them. For this set of experiments equal mass of helium gas was pumped through all layers of the regenerators during the two flow steps of the four-step AMR cycle. After successfully reaching 135 K, a compact condensing coil-fin tube heat exchanger (HEX) with a small storage vessel was mounted in the cold region of the dual regenerator assembly to be cooled during the hot-to-cold helium flow from alternatively demagnetized regenerators. The cold HEX was used to cool and liquefy a process stream of methane gas supplied at 295 K and different pressures in different runs. Further, by measuring time to liquefy a known volume of methane at three different pressures, cooling powers of the AMRR as a function of temperature were determined. The resultant data were compared to those predicted by the AMRR performance model.

"How close are urban scale building simulations to measured data? Examining bias derived from building metadata in urban building energy modeling","Bass, Brett; New, Joshua; Clinton, Nicholas; Adams, Mark; Copeland, Bill; Amoo, Charles","32 ENERGY CONSERVATION, CONSUMPTION, AND UTILIZATION; Buildings; Energy; Modeling","Residential and commercial buildings in the United States accounted for 40% of total energy in 2020. Building energy modeling (BEM) is a useful tool that allows individuals, researchers, companies, or utilities to save energy by optimizing buildings through estimation of building technology savings and performance projection of building energy under various environmental conditions. Urban building energy modeling (UBEM) expands the scope beyond individual buildings to the buildings in a neighborhood, city, utility and more. Yet there is a knowledge gap in the literature as to how these models compare to measured data on an individual and aggregated basis. As UBEM data and methods continue to develop, it is important to consider the accuracy, bias, and limitations of the models. Here, nation-scale data and UBEM software suite named Automatic Building Energy Modeling (AutoBEM) was used to model 50,843 buildings in Chattanooga, Tennessee. The uncalibrated simulation results were compared to aggregated 15-minute electricity data for the year 2019 with visualizations highlighting sources of bias in building data and the AutoBEM framework while considering how they relate to other UBEM methods. Estimation of building type and year of constructions are found to be the major sources of bias. Accounting for the amount of conditioned area per building significantly improves the overall fit of the simulated energy use intensity. it was found that inherent variation in building energy use contributes to R<sup>2</sup> values between 0.008 and 0.095 across building types but slope values near 1 for the total number of buildings. This indicates the need for building aggregation for representative building energy modeling with data sources available at an urban scale while illustrating the need for additional individual building data and model improvement beyond the originally produced UBEM models for individual building analysis.","Elsevier","","Oak Ridge National Lab.

"Why is it still too warm or cold in my house? Examining the relationships between energy efficient capital and household energy insecurity","Harker Steele, Amanda J.; Bergstrom, John C.","32 ENERGY CONSERVATION, CONSUMPTION, AND UTILIZATION; Energy insecurity; Energy efficient capital technology; Stochastic production function; Household production theory; Random utility model","Here, this paper examines the relationships between energy efficient (EE) capital technology and household energy insecurity in the United States. The theoretical model of these relationships employs household production theory to capture the demand for and production of household energy services, and a stochastic production frontier approach to describe how having access to and the usage intensity of EE capital technology could help alleviate inefficiency in the production of household energy services. A working hypothesis formulated from the theoretical model posits that having EE capital technology in the home will reduce the level of household energy insecurity experienced. The extent of energy insecurity experienced is inferred from an energy insecurity index value assigned to each household, generated via the application of a dichotomous Rasch model to questions contained in the 2015 Residential Energy Consumption Survey. Noting the potential simultaneous relationship that exists between a household having access to and the usage intensity of EE capital technology and the experience of being energy insecure, an instrumental variables approach was employed to estimate a series of ordered logit models. Results suggest access to EE capital technology in the form of Energy Star® appliances, Energy Star® windows, or a SMART thermostat does not reduce the probability of experiencing a greater level of energy insecurity. Nor does the usage intensity of EE capital. Thus, policy instruments designed to alleviate household energy insecurity may need to go beyond simply helping households obtain EE capital technology.","Elsevier","","National Energy Technology Laboratory (NETL), Pittsburgh, PA, Morgantown, WV, and Albany, OR (United States)","USDOE Office of Fossil Energy (FE); USDA","","United States","2022-10-14T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: Energy Research and Social Science; Journal Volume: 93","","Medium: ED; Size: Article No. 102827","","","2013-38420-20521","Journal ID: ISSN 2214-6296","10.1016/j.erss.2022.102827","","2022-11-15T00:00:00Z","1893726","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/1893726","","Energy Research and Social Science","","93"

"Air Handling Unit Shutdowns During Scheduled Unoccupied Hours: US Commercial Building Stock Prevalence and Energy Impact","CaraDonna, Chris; Dombrovski, Kelsea","32 ENERGY CONSERVATION, CONSUMPTION, AND UTILIZATION; comstock; HVAC controls; HVAC fault modeling; stock energy modeling","Commercial buildings account for 18% of U.S. energy consumption, with 44% used for heating, ventilation, and air conditioning (HVAC). American Society of Heating, Refrigerating and Air Conditioning Engineers (ASHRAE) 90.1 requires HVAC systems to shutdown fans and outdoor air ventilation during unoccupied times, only allowing fans to cycle on, without outdoor air, to maintain thermostat setpoints. However, it is minimally understood how often existing building operations align with energy code requirements and the energy implications of not doing so. This study used building automation system data from 843 buildings containing 5706 air handling units (AHUs) to determine three unoccupied AHU shutdown control schemes ranging in efficiency and then estimated their prevalence in the U.S. commercial building stock, segmented by building type. ComStock was then used to analyze the energy savings potential of implementing the most energy efficient unoccupied shutdown control scheme in non-participating buildings across the U.S commercial building stock. Results show that only 23% of AHUs align completely with the ASHRAE 90.1 requirement. ComStock modeling results show 4% annual stock energy savings by switching all non-participating buildings to the most efficient scheme, with 19% annual energy savings demonstrated for the median building switching from the least efficient scheme to the most efficient. Findings also show 114.5 TBtu electricity and 75.8 TBtu natural gas fuel savings when converting to the most efficient scheme.

"Multiport Control with Partial Power Processing in Solid-State Transformer for PV, Storage, and Fast-Charging Electric Vehicle Integration","Zheng, Liran; Kandula, Rajendra Prasad; Divan, Deepak","25 ENERGY STORAGE; 14 SOLAR ENERGY; 17 WIND ENERGY; 24 POWER TRANSMISSION AND DISTRIBUTION; 32 ENERGY CONSERVATION, CONSUMPTION, AND UTILIZATION; 42 ENGINEERING; Power electronic transformer (PET); current-source converter (CSC); current-source inverter (CSI); differential power processing (DPP); modulation; battery energy storage system (BESS); photovoltaic (PV); electric vehicle (EV); medium-frequency transformer (MFT); distributed renewable energy resource","This article proposes a multiport control method to enable partial power processing (PPP) in a medium-voltage (MV) multiport solid-state transformer (SST). MV multiport SSTs are promising in integrating low-voltage DC sources or loads such as solar photovoltaic, energy storage, and electric vehicles into smart grids without bulky line-frequency transformers. Compared to voltage-source SST, current-source (CS) SST features single-stage isolated bidirectional AC/AC, AC/DC, or DC/DC conversion using an inductive DC link. For a multiport CS SST, it is revealed in this article that the PPP capability can be enabled through the proposed control without extra hardware, different from the case of voltage-source converters where special hardware architecture is required for the PPP. With the PPP, most power exchange between LV ports is processed by only a fraction of the entire conversion stage, leading to reduced DC-link current, volume, loss, and improved efficiency. The proposed multiport PPP control scheme is analyzed to verify the advantages across a wide voltage and power range against conventional full power processing (FPP) multiport control, using the soft-switching solid-state transformer (S4T) with reduced conduction loss as an example. Comparative experimental results based on a SiC three-port S4T prototype verify the effectiveness of the proposed PPP scheme against the FPP scheme under both steady state and dynamic conditions. Here, the DC-link current reduction is measured to be more than 36%. Significantly, the proposed multiport PPP control scheme is generic and applicable to any hard-switching or soft-switching CS SSTs without extra hardware.","IEEE","","Georgia Institute of Technology, Atlanta, GA (United States)","USDOE Advanced Research Projects Agency - Energy (ARPA-E)","","United States","2022-09-30T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: IEEE Transactions on Power Electronics; Journal Volume: 38; Journal Issue: 2","","Medium: ED; Size: p. 2606-2616","","","AR0000899","Journal ID: ISSN 0885-8993","10.1109/tpel.2022.3211000","","2023-03-27T00:00:00Z","1892471","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/1892471","","IEEE Transactions on Power Electronics","2","38"

Window attachments can help mitigate the energy demand by controlling the solar heat gains and enhancing window thermal resistance. Cellular shades have the potential of superior thermal performance compared with generic shades because of its honeycomb structure. Here, in this study, the team analyzed the energy savings potential of cellular shades in residential homes via experimental testing for two heating seasons and energy simulations. Five shading devices—three single-cell and two double cellular/cell-in-cell shades—were used to compare the performance with generic horizontal venetian blinds using two nearly identical side-by-side rooms in a residential home. The experimental testing showed daily heating energy savings in the range of 17%–36% compared with the case without shades. The experimental testing data also exhibited improvements in thermal comfort when using cellular shades. Additionally, energy simulations were performed to evaluate the energy savings potential of the cellular shades using a residential prototype home, which demonstrated energy savings up to 9 kWh/m2/year in cold climates. The total site energy savings for heating and cooling from cellular shades was up to ~9% for the home with a heat pump and up to ~15% for a home with a gas furnace compared with cases without any shading devices. The energy savings at a national scale were up to 14.6 TWh assuming a 20% penetration rate in residential homes.","Elsevier","","Oak Ridge National Lab.

This paper presents classical molecular dynamics studies on polycrystalline inorganic lithium fluoride (LiF) layers to model and predict the SEI transport properties. The ionic conductivity is obtained from the lithium-ion diffusivity in polycrystalline structures of LiF using the Nernst-Einstein relation. The predicted molecular dynamics data are used in a continuum scale phase-field model to evaluate the plating kinetics under fast charging conditions. The analysis emphasizes that the SEI ionic conductivity properties impact the plating dynamics, where SEI's low ion conductivity value is prone to large plating and subsequent capacity degradation. The combination of atomic and continuum scale studies shown herein lays a foundation to tune in SEI transport properties to decrease the amount of lithium plating and improve the performance of fast-charging batteries.","American Physical Society (APS)","","Oak Ridge National Lab.

However, there is a lack of systematic evaluation of the effectiveness of WELL in achieving its goal. This study investigates the impact of WELL certification on occupant satisfaction with the workplace and occupant perceived health, well-being, and productivity. More than 1300 pre- and post-occupancy survey responses provided by the nearly same cohort of occupants from six companies in North America were quantitatively analyzed. The results showed that transitioning to WELL certified offices from non-WELL certified offices had a positive impact on occupant satisfaction with the workplace and occupant perceived health, well-being, and productivity, with increases in means from pre-to post-occupancy being highly statistically significant. The majority of the studied occupant satisfaction parameters as well as occupant perceived mental health had large effect sizes. While they improved from pre-to post-occupancy, the analysis revealed small effect sizes for occupant perceived physical health and self-assessed productivity. The majority of the effect sizes for the perceived well-being parameters were large and medium. In addition to analyzing the survey responses in aggregate, the responses were examined at the individual company level to confirm the by-company and aggregate findings aligned.","Elsevier","","National Renewable Energy Lab.

"Stochastic simulation of occupant-driven energy use in a bottom-up residential building stock model","Chen, Jianli; Adhikari, Rajendra; Wilson, Eric; Robertson, Joseph; Fontanini, Anthony; Polly, Ben; Olawale, Opeoluwa","32 ENERGY CONSERVATION, CONSUMPTION, AND UTILIZATION; agent-based modeling; building stock modeling; Markov chain; occupant modeling; residential electricity use; stochastic occupant behavior model; urban building energy modeling","The residential buildings sector is one of the largest electricity consumers worldwide and contributes disproportionally to peak electricity demand in many regions. Strongly driven by occupant activities, household energy consumption is stochastic and heterogeneous in nature. However, most residential energy models applied by industry use homogeneous, deterministic activity schedules, which work well for predictions of annual energy consumption, but can result in unrealistic hourly or sub-hourly electric load profiles, with exaggerated or muted peaks. The increasing proportion of variable renewable energy generators means that representing the heterogeneity and stochasticity of occupant behavior is now crucial for reliable planning at both bulk-power and distribution-system scales. This work presents a novel and open-source occupancy simulation approach that can simulate a diverse set of individual occupant and household event schedules for all major electricity, fuel, and hot water end uses. To accomplish this, we evaluated three alternative occupant activity simulation approaches before selecting a hybrid combining time-inhomogeneous Markov chains and probability-sampling of event durations and magnitudes. Further, we integrated the stochastic occupancy simulation with an open-source bottom-up physics-simulation building stock model and published a set of 550,000 diverse household end-use activity schedules representing a national housing stock. The simulator was verified against time-use survey data, and simulation results were validated against measured end-use electricity data for accuracy and reliability. While we use data for the United States, our application demonstrates how similar approaches could be applied using the time-use survey data collected in many countries around the world.","Elsevier","","National Renewable Energy Lab.

In particular, the edge-seal is a key component that significantly affects the thermal insulation and mechanical performance, and the development of edge-seal with adequate thermal insulation, mechanical strength, and reasonable processing cost is essential to overcome such technical issues in VIG. For this purpose, effects of edge-seal design parameters on the VIG performance should be identified. In this research, we analyzed the edge-seal for thermal transport as well as structural stresses to study the effects, and then identified and evaluated the material mixes for the edge-seal requirements. Here, the finite element simulations showed the significance of VIG corner calculation on overall thermal transmittance and the importance of seal conductivity below 1 W/m.K. The experiments with the flexible seals with different ratios of fine glass powder demonstrated that the measured shear strength values for the seal with less than 30% glass powder were more than 10 times larger than the calculated shear stress values. Based on these simulation and experimental results, a flexible sealant was developed using a proprietary mix of ceramic materials that meets the requirements of the designed VIG edge-seal, including structural as well as thermal stress resistance and a low conductivity. Moreover, the sealant is self-curing under atmospheric conditions, and thus it does not require costly inline process of laser curing or oven baking.","Elsevier","","Oak Ridge National Lab.

In this paper, we argue that the lack of access to high-quality data on the current and historical travel demand and interdisciplinary research hinders transport planning and sustainable transitions toward low-carbon transport futures. We call for a greater interdisciplinary collaboration agenda across open data, data science, behaviour modelling, and policy analysis.

However, uncertainty in residential energy systems is a significant issue and can reduce the benefits of a HEMS to the homeowner or grid operator. Sources of uncertainty include weather forecasts, predictions of energy-related occupant activities (e.g., hot water draws), and parameter estimation for the building envelope and energy-consuming equipment. This paper tackles the problem of uncertainty by developing a framework that simulates HEMS in uncertain conditions and evaluates the performance of multiple control strategies. A linear, reduced-order residential building model for model predictive control applications is derived and compared to a full-order model. Stochastic model predictive control is shown to perform better than deterministic and heuristic methods when considering realistic forecasts with uncertainty. The framework can evaluate the performance of HEMS in real-world applications, which can help de-risk HEMS deployment.","Elsevier","","National Renewable Energy Lab.

Existing thermal comfort systems require occupants to frequently communicate their comfort vote via a survey which is impractical as a long-term solution. Here, we present a novel thermal infrared-fused computer vision sensing method to capture thermoregulation performance in a non-intrusive and non-invasive manner. In this method, we align thermal and visible images, detect facial segments (i.e., nose, eyes, face boundary), and accordingly read the temperatures from the appropriate coordinates in the thermal image. We focus on the human face since it is often clearly visible to cameras and is not merged into a hot background (unlike hands). We use a regularized Gaussian Mixture model to track the thermoregulation changes over time and apply a heuristic algorithm to extract hot and cold indices. We present a personalized and a generalized comfort modeling method, selected based on the availability of the occupant historical indices measurements in a neutral environment, and use the time-series of the hot and cold indices to define corrections to HVAC system operations in the form of setpoint constraints. To evaluate the efficacy of our proposed approach in responding to thermal stimuli, we designed a series of controlled experiments to simulate exposure to cold and hot environments. While applying personalized modeling showed an acceptable average accuracy of 91.3%, the generalized model’s average accuracy was only 65.2%. This shows the importance of having access to physiological records in modeling and assessing comfort. We also found that individual differences should be considered in selecting the cooling and heating rates when some knowledge of the occupant’s overall thermal preference is available.</p>","MDPI AG","","Lawrence Berkeley National Lab.

In particular, as deep reinforcement learning (DRL) has shown great success in complex control problems, DRL-based control has been considered as a potential solution to efficiently control and manage building systems. However, broad assessment of DRL-based building control is still required to characterize their pros and cons in comparison with conventional building control methods (e.g., rule-based feedback controls). In this paper, we assessed DRL-based controls with on-policy learning-based algorithms and continuous control actions for cooling control of large office buildings in the summer season to minimize whole-building energy use and occupant discomfort. We compared DRL-based control methods with two baseline control methods: (1) a pre-determined schedule with supply temperature and static pressure setpoints, and (2) advanced reset method that adjusts setpoints based on heuristic rules, i.e., ASHRAE Guideline 36. We also tested the DRL algorithms to evaluate their performances in multiple climate locations. We found that DRL-based control methods outperformed the baseline control methods in terms of energy savings while maintaining a thermal comfort. DRL reduced energy use between ~4%–22% on average compared to the baseline methods, depending on climate location. We also evaluated DRL-based control in terms of control stability and showed that DRL-based methods should address the span of hardware lifetimes in practical operations.","Taylor & Francis","","Pacific Northwest National Lab.

Building energy flexibility may address several challenges facing energy systems and electricity consumers as society transitions to a low-carbon energy system characterized by distributed and intermittent energy resources. For example, by changing the timing and amount of building energy consumption through advanced building technologies, electricity demand and supply balance can be improved to enable greater integration of variable renewable energy. Although the benefits of utilizing energy flexibility from the built environment are generally recognized, solutions that reflect diversity in building stocks, customer behavior, and market rules and regulations need to be developed for successful implementation. In this paper, we pose and answer ten questions covering technological, social, commercial, and regulatory aspects to enable the utilization of energy flexibility of buildings in practice. In particular, we provide a critical overview of techniques and methods for quantifying and harnessing energy flexibility. We discuss the concepts of resilience and multi-carrier energy systems and their relation to energy flexibility. We argue the importance of balancing stakeholder engagement and technology deployment.

"Predicting the Impact of Utility Lighting Rebate Programs on Promoting Industrial Energy Efficiency: A Machine Learning Approach","Shook, Phillip (ORCID:0000000184236667); Choi, Jun-Ki","32 ENERGY CONSERVATION, CONSUMPTION, AND UTILIZATION; industrial energy efficiency; energy audit; machine learning; lighting rebates","<p>Implementation costs are a major factor in manufacturers’ decisions to invest in energy-efficient technologies. Emerging technologies in lighting systems, however, typically require small investment costs and offer short, simple payback periods, due, in part, to federal, state, and utility incentive programs. Recently, however, certain state and federal mandates have reduced the support for and efficacy of electricity utility incentivizing programs. To determine the impact of such support programs, this study examined historical data regarding lighting retrofit savings, implementation costs, and utility rebates gathered from 13 years of industrial energy audits by a U.S. Department of Energy Industrial Assessment Center in a midwestern state. It uses a machine learning approach to evaluate the industrial energy and cost-saving opportunities that may have been lost due to decisions attributable to legislative mandates, utility policies, and manufacturers’ calculations and to evaluate the potential effect of lighting rebates on manufacturers’ decisions to implement industrial energy-efficient lighting retrofits. The results indicate that the decision not to implement lighting energy efficiency recommendations resulted in a loss of more than USD800,000 in potential rebates by industries during the study period and that the implementation of lighting energy assessment recommendations could have increased by about 50% if electric utility rebates had been available. These findings can help industries evaluate the benefits of implementing lighting efficiency improvements, and help utilities determine feasible lighting retrofit rebate values for incentivizing such changes by the industries they serve.</p>","MDPI AG","","University of Dayton, OH (United States)","USDOE","","Canada","2022-08-06T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: Environments (Online) Journal Volume: 9 Journal Issue: 8","","Medium: X; Size: Article No. 100","","","EE0009721; EE0007710","Journal ID: ISSN 2076-3298; PII: environments9080100","10.3390/environments9080100","","2022-08-10T00:00:00Z","1880152","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/1880152","","Environments (Online)","8","9"
"Integrating air quality and health considerations into power sector decarbonization strategies","Peng, Wei; Ou, Yang","32 ENERGY CONSERVATION, CONSUMPTION, AND UTILIZATION; electricity sector; decarbonization; co-benefits; health","Climate change and public health are two interconnected societal challenges. Curbing fossil-based electricity generation reduces the emissions of both CO<sub>2</sub> and air pollutants, which brings tangible health benefits from improved air quality. The potential health benefits from decarbonizing the grid are enormous, immediate, and widespread. From renewable portfolio standards to carbon market, the health co-benefits from clean electricity policies often outweigh their policy costs. As climate action goes local, framing decarbonization around health benefits also makes it more personally relevant and economically attractive. Yet, to date, the health impacts have largely been viewed as ancillary benefits from decarbonization, rather than as a core consideration when energy strategies are formed, assessed and implemented. When strategic choices are made about retiring old infrastructure and building new ones, bringing public health to the center of the discussion can generate greater health benefits with more equitable distribution. Here we identify concrete ways to incorporate air quality and health considerations into power sector decarbonization strategies. We draw insights mainly from empirical and modeling evidence for the United States. These insights are generally applicable and could guide health-oriented decarbonization efforts in other countries as well.","IOP Publishing","","Pacific Northwest National Lab.

In this analysis, we assess decarbonization pathways for the US residential sector to 2060, through 108 scenarios describing housing stock evolution, new housing characteristics, renovation levels and clean electricity. The lowest emission pathways involve very rapid decarbonization of electricity supply alongside extensive renovations to existing homes, including improving thermal envelopes and heat pump electrification of heating. Reducing the size and increasing the electrification of new homes provide further emission cuts and combining all strategies enables reductions of 91% between 2020 and 2050. The potential of individual mitigation strategies shows great regional variation. Reaching zero emissions will require simultaneous deployment of multiple strategies and greater reduction of embodied emissions.","Nature Publishing Group","","National Renewable Energy Lab.

The topics we cover include trends in home electrification, US and European home energy upgrade programs, energy upgrade measure costs, business economics, and health effects. Key changes in project design noted in this review include: (1) the electrification of dwellings with rapidly improving heat pump systems and low-cost solar photovoltaic technology; and (2) a shift away from high-cost building envelope strategies and towards more traditional home performance/weatherization envelope upgrades. Promising program design strategies covered include: (1) end-use electrification programs; (2) novel financing approaches; (3) the use of carbon-based program and project metrics; and (4) “one-stop shop” programs. Based on the existing market barriers, we suggest that the industry should adopt new project performance metrics.

"Initial Findings from US Department of Energy’s Better Plants Virtual in-Plant Training on 50001 Ready","Guo, Wei; Wenning, Thomas; Travis, Jennifer; Stowe, Michael; Armstrong, Kristina; Nimbalkar, Sachin; Levine, Eli","32 ENERGY CONSERVATION, CONSUMPTION, AND UTILIZATION; ISO 50001; 50001 ready; energy management system; energy efficiency; manufacturing industry; training; manufacturing workforce development","Manufacturing facilities use about 35% of the domestic energy in the United States every year. Implementing an effective energy management system (EnMS) is one of the most important approaches to improve energy efficiency. However, the implementation of EnMS is low for many countries (including the US) and even for energy-intensive sectors. The reasons for the low implementation rate of energy management systems had been investigated by multiple researchers, but very few studies have focused on the barriers and challenges of implementing ISO 50001-based energy management systems. To contribute to this understudied area, this paper discusses the implementation and outcomes of the first Better Plants 50001 Ready Virtual In-plant Training. This paper first provides an overview of 50001 Ready and the 50001 Ready Navigator Tool. Then, it provides details on this training event and its outcomes. Finally, it discusses findings from the responses to 40 live polling questions about the status of the 25 tasks of the 50001 Ready Navigator for participating companies, key components of the participating manufacturing companies’ energy management systems, and challenges and barriers that these companies are facing. The findings suggest that although many companies understood the importance of an effective energy management system, about half of them do not understand the required resources for building energy management systems, and most of them have only just begun establishing these systems and need more assistance and resources in multiple areas. More specifically, more assistance is necessary for the following: (1) improving corporate management’s understanding of the time and resources needed to build an EnMS as well as the benefits; (2) creating linear regression models for more accurate energy performance tracking; (3) understanding energy use, collecting and analyzing energy performance data; (4) optimizing equipment operational controls, and creating action plans.","MDPI","","Oak Ridge National Lab.

"Communication breakdown: Energy efficiency recommendations to address the disconnect between building operators and occupants","Ruiz, Shelby N.; Day, Julia K.; Govertsen, Krissy; Kane, Michael","32 ENERGY CONSERVATION, CONSUMPTION, AND UTILIZATION; building operation; occupant comfort; operator and occupant relationships; qualitative research; tenant engagement","As technology advances, progressive building performance goals are met with ease and occupant behavior plays an increasingly significant role in preventing building operators from achieving those goals. However, removing occupants from participating in building control and operation is counterintuitive to the purpose of building operation. Occupant-centric control (OCC) has been suggested as a means of incorporating the occupant while simultaneously reducing the negative impact their behavior can have on building performance. As a result, operators are now tasked with incorporating OCC into their daily operation. The relationship between building occupants and operators is a critical component to OCC, and balancing occupant comfort and building performance. In this paper, we present findings from an international qualitative study of building operators with a focus on the operator and occupant relationship. This paper identifies the role operators play in OCC, how these relationships develop, and how these relationships impact building operation through two key research questions: What factors influence the quality of relationships between occupants and operators? How can the relationships between operators and occupants be improved? Subsequently, these questions revealed this relationship becomes strained when building performance is prioritized over comfort, occupants are ignored or uneducated, and feedback is negative or sparse. In short: there is a disconnection between operators and occupants. Here we propose several solutions including modifying job requirements to prioritize occupant comfort, educating occupants to make autonomous decisions that are not detrimental to operation, and creating effective communication channels for instances where operator intervention is required.","Elsevier","","National Renewable Energy Lab.

Here, we demonstrate a voltage-actuated, contact/non-contact thermal switch that meets the unique challenges of this application. The switch is non-volatile, consuming electricity only briefly while switching and none to hold steady state. The switch ratio is 12, the off state has a low effective thermal conductivity of 0.045 W m<sup>-1</sup>K<sup>-1</sup>, comparable to fiberglass insulation, and the performance is stable over 1,000 switching cycles. Numerical simulations using real-world climate data show that combining this thermal switch with a thermal storage layer in a building envelope can yield annual energy savings of 9%-55% (heating) and 17%-76% (air conditioning), depending on the climate zone. The greatest benefits are realized when the exterior temperature crosses well above and below the desired interior temperature within a single 24 h period.","Elsevier","","National Renewable Energy Lab.

A common approach is to target behaviors with the greatest energy-saving potential. The concept of behavioral spillover introduces further considerations, namely that adoption of one energy-saving behavior may increase (or decrease) the likelihood of other energy-saving behaviors. This research aimed to identify and describe household energy- and water-saving measure classes within which positive spillover is likely to occur (e.g., adoption of energy-efficient appliances may correlate with adoption of water-efficient appliances), and explore demographic and psychographic predictors of each. Nearly 1,000 households in a California city were surveyed and asked to report whether they had adopted 75 different energy- and/or water-saving measures. Principal Component Analysis and Network Analysis based on correlations between adoption of these diverse measures revealed and characterized eight water-energy-saving measure classes: Water Conservation, Energy Conservation, Maintenance and Management, Efficient Appliance, Advanced Efficiency, Efficient Irrigation, Green Gardening, and Green Landscaping. Understanding these measure classes can help guide behavior-based energy program developers in selecting target behaviors and designing interventions.","Public Library of Science","","Lawrence Berkeley National Lab.

With the changing power system and rapid advancement in building energy control technology, technology providers and demand response aggregators need to know what potential revenues could be obtained by providing grid services. We dispatch a normalized and parameterized model of building load shifting against marginal service prices from grid investment and operational models to produce a database of the capacity, energy, and ancillary service revenues (gross value of providing bulk power system services) for a marginal kilowatt-hour (kWh) of shiftable load. The database is geographically disaggregated, hourly, and parameterized so that flexibility value can be estimated for a wide range of building technologies. The database covers the contiguous United States under three 2030 grid scenarios. Given the high degree of uncertainty in such grid projections, the results are perhaps best interpreted in terms of regional climate and grid mixes and are thus potentially applicable in non-U.S. contexts. Upon analyzing the results, we find the monthly mean gross value of building load shifting is 0-38 cents/kWh-day and the daily gross value of shifting the highest-value hour each day can be up to 620 cents/kWh-day. The different revenues obtained by aggregating results in different ways, as well as observed regional and seasonal differences, suggest different building technologies and grid environments might call for demand response program designs and business models.","Elsevier","","National Renewable Energy Lab.

Ice storage has low initial and maintenance costs, but there is an efficiency penalty for charging of storage and it can only shift electrical loads associated with building cooling requirements. A battery's round-trip efficiency, on the contrary, is quite consistent and batteries can be used to shift both HVAC and non-HVAC loads. However, batteries have greater initial costs and a shorter life.

"Realistic operation of two residential cordwood-fired outdoor hydronic heater appliances—Part 1: Particulate and gaseous emissions","Trojanowski, Rebecca; Lindberg, Jake; Butcher, Thomas; Fthenakis, Vasilis","32 ENERGY CONSERVATION, CONSUMPTION, AND UTILIZATION","This study investigated how heat demand and fuel loading affect the emissions from outdoor wood-fired hydronic heaters by testing two such appliances using an integrated-duty cycle test method. This test included transient operating conditions, such as cold and hot-starts and modulation between 15 and 100% of maximum rated output. Emission values indicate transient operating conditions produce higher emissions than steady state operation. Cold starts resulted in elevated particulate matter emission factors for both appliances; in one case the particulate matter emission factor for this period was >3500 mg/MJ, which represented emissions 20 times the average value. Additionally, when heat demand was cycled—elevated CO emission factors were measured, with values >5000 mg/MJ for both appliances and more than 3 times the appliance averages, respectively. It follows that the appliance average particulate matter emission factors and CO emission factors were not representative of the actual EF values during these transient periods. In contrast, methane emission factors were relatively stable throughout all tested combustion conditions; however, they were much higher than oil-fired appliances are therefore should not be ignored. These findings demonstrate that wood-fired hydronic heater emissions during transient operating conditions can be significantly greater than emissions during steady-state test conditions, such as those used in typical certification tests. Consequently, certification test values for particulate matter and CO emission factors may significantly underestimate the actual emissions of these appliances when operated in a home. Use of integrated duty-cycle test protocols that capture cold-starts and reloading are better for representing in-use operations of wood-fired hydronic heaters and provide more realistic emissions and delivered efficiency measurements.","Taylor and Francis","","Brookhaven National Lab.

In this study, we will describe (1) a method for measuring primary BC and BrC emissions from two residential log-fired wood hydronic heaters and (2) the BC and BrC emission from these devices over a wide range of operating conditions, such as cold-starts, warm-starts, four different levels of output ranging from 15% to 100% maximum rated output, and periods of repeated cycling. The range in flue-gas BC concentrations, measured using an aethalometer at the 880 nanometer (nm) wavelength, were between 5.09 × 10<sup>2</sup> and 2.24 × 10<sup>4</sup> micrograms per cubic meter (µg/m<sup>3</sup>) while the scattering coefficient of the flue-gas, measured by a nephelometer at 880 nm, ranged between 2.20 × 10<sup>3</sup> and 8.56 × 10<sup>5</sup> inverse megameters (Mm<sup>–1</sup>). The BrC concentrations, measured using the 370 nm wavelength of an aethalometer, were between 9.10 × 10<sup>1</sup> and 3.56 × 10<sup>4</sup> µg/m<sup>3</sup>. The calculated Angstrom Absorption Exponent (AAE) of the flue-gas aerosol ranged between 1.54 and 3.63. Performing a comparison between the measured BC concentration and an external particulate matter (PM) concentration showed that overall BC makes up roughly a quarter of the PM emitted by either of the two appliances. Further for both appliances, the cold-start and the test phase immediately following it had the highest BC and BrC concentrations, the highest measured scattering coefficient, as well as a low AAE.","Taylor and Francis","","Brookhaven National Lab.

However, due to a number of factors, including the required implementation expertise, lack of high quality data, and a risk-adverse industry, MPC has yet to gain widespread adoption. While many previous studies have shown the advantages of MPC, few analyzed the implementation effort and associated practical challenges. In addition, previous work has developed an open-source, Modelica-based tool-chain that automatically generates optimal control, parameter estimation, and state estimation problems aimed at facilitating MPC implementation. Therefore, this study demonstrates usage of this tool-chain to implement MPC in a real office building, discusses practical challenges of implementing MPC, and estimates the implementation effort associated with various tasks in order to inform the development of future workflows and serve as an initial benchmark for their impact on reducing implementation effort. This study finds that the implemented MPC saves approximately 40% of HVAC energy over the existing control during a two-month trial period and that tasks related to data collection and controller deployment activities can each require as much effort as model generation.","Elsevier","","Lawrence Berkeley National Lab.

"Realistic operation of two residential cordwood-fired outdoor hydronic heater appliances—Part 2: Particle number and size","Lindberg, Jake; Vitillo, Nicole; Wurth, Marilyn; Frank, Brian P.; Tang, Shida; LaDuke, Gil; Fritz, Patricia Mason; Trojanowski, Rebecca; Butcher, Thomas; Mahajan, Devinder","32 ENERGY CONSERVATION, CONSUMPTION, AND UTILIZATION","The use of wood as a fuel for home heating is a concern from an environmental health and safety perspective as biomass combustion appliances emit high concentrations of particulate matter. Wood burning significantly contributes to wintertime particulate matter concentrations in many states in the northern United States. Of particular concern are outdoor wood-fired hydronic heaters. These devices are concerning as they tend to have very large combustion chambers and typical use patterns can result in long periods of low output, which result in an increased particulate matter emission rate relative to high heat output operating conditions. In this study, the performance of two hydronic heaters operating under different combustion conditions, including four different heat output categories approximately corresponding to categories I–IV denoted in Environmental Protection Agency Method 28 Outdoor Wood-fired Hydronic Heaters, and during start-up and reloading events were investigated. Measurements of flue gas particulate number concentration and size for particles with aerodynamic diameters between 0.006 and 10 µm were made using a dilution sampling system. The measured particle number concentration in the flue gas was between 0.71 and 420 million particles per cubic centimeter and was dependent on fuel loading and heat output. For each hydronic heater tested, the highest average particle concentration was found at the beginning of each test during the cold-start condition. Additionally, the majority of the particles had aerodynamic diameters less than 0.100 µm (particles of this size made up between 64% and 97% of all particles) and less than 1% of all particles had aerodynamic diameters greater than 1 µm for all phases. For particles in the accumulation mode, between 0.100 and 1 µm, the mean particle diameter was dependent on fuel loading and heat output.","Taylor and Francis","","Brookhaven National Lab.

We perform a three-part review: of decision science literature on best practices for decision-making under uncertainty, of industry practice documents to understand how new uncertainties may affect the types of decisions electric utilities are making today, and of literature on electricity sector planning under climate change to assess how lessons from decision science might fit into sector-specific analyses. We discuss how characterizations of uncertainty from the decision science literature might guide approaches in the electricity sector to appropriately capture climate-related uncertainties. We also distill three key ideas from the decision science literature that can be incorporated into electricity sector planning to manage these new uncertainties: robustness, adaptive planning, and multi-stakeholder engagement.

"Building Analytics Tool Deployment at Scale: Benefits, Costs, and Deployment Practices","Lin, Guanjing (ORCID:0000000177688358); Kramer, Hannah; Nibler, Valerie; Crowe, Eliot; Granderson, Jessica","32 ENERGY CONSERVATION, CONSUMPTION, AND UTILIZATION; building analytics; smart building; energy management; energy information system; fault detection and diagnostics; costs and benefits","Buildings are becoming more data-rich. Building analytics tools, including energy information systems (EIS) and fault detection and diagnostic (FDD) tools, have emerged to enable building operators to translate large amounts of time-series data into actionable findings to achieve energy and non-energy benefits. To expedite data analytics adoption and facilitate technology innovation, building owners, technology developers, and researchers need reliable cost–benefit data and evidence-based guidance on deployment practices. This paper fulfills these needs with the energy use and survey data from a wide-ranging research and industry partnership program that covers thousands of buildings installed with analytics tools. The paper indicates that after two years of implementation, organizations using FDD tools and EIS tools achieved 9% and 3% median annual energy savings, respectively. The median base cost and annual recurring cost for FDD are USD 0.65 per square meter (m<sup>2</sup>) (USD 0.06 per square foot [ft<sup>2</sup>]) and USD 0.22 per m<sup>2</sup> (USD 0.02 per ft<sup>2</sup>), and are USD 0.11 per m<sup>2</sup> (USD 0.01 per ft<sup>2</sup>) and USD 0.11 per m<sup>2</sup> (USD 0.01 per ft<sup>2</sup>) for EIS. The common metrics and analyses that are used in the tools to support the discovery of energy efficiency measures are summarized in detail. Two best practice examples identified to maximize the benefits of tool implementation are also presented. Opportunities to advance the state of technology include simplified data integration and management, and more efficient processes for acting on analytics outputs. Compared with previous efforts in the literature, the findings presented in this paper demonstrate the effectiveness of building analytics tools with the largest known dataset.","MDPI AG","","Lawrence Berkeley National Lab.

Brick schema models were developed to represent sensor and room metadata information. The database is publicly available, and a website was created for the public to access, query, and download specific datasets or the whole database interactively. The database can help to advance the knowledge and understanding of realistic occupancy patterns and human-building interactions with building systems (e.g., light switching, set-point changes on thermostats, fans on/off, etc.) and envelopes (e.g., window opening/closing).

"Multi-technology building system retrofits for utility incentive programs: Savings, costs and baseline considerations","Regnier, Cindy; Mathew, Paul; Shackelford, Jordan; Lee, Sang Hoon; Robinson, Alastair; Walter, Travis","32 ENERGY CONSERVATION, CONSUMPTION, AND UTILIZATION; Efficiency; Utility; Incentive; Baseline; Code; Systems; Packages; Retrofit; Energy efficiency; Utility incentive program; Technology packages; System packages","Utility incentive programs are an important channel to support the deployment of energy efficiency in buildings. To date, these programs have largely been limited to single-component strategies. However, many utilities are now motivated to identify and develop multi-component system retrofits to achieve deeper energy savings, which are essential to achieving broader energy and greenhouse gas reduction goals in the buildings sector. In this paper we present the energy savings, demand reductions, and cost-effectiveness of 16 systems retrofit packages in six utility regions in the United States. These results are being used by these utilities to inform and develop incentive programs for systems retrofits. Our analysis shows that packages with proven lighting and HVAC measures can provide 5–22% whole building annual energy savings, and 13–22% annual energy costs savings, using utility incentive program baselines (code and existing building). The packages are reasonably cost effective for replace-on-burnout but generally not for a retrofit scenario prior to end of equipment life. Demand response can increase both the energy savings and energy cost savings, further improving the cost effectiveness of these packages. We analyzed the impact of using existing building vs. code baselines for calculating savings, showing that the choice of baseline in developing utility incentive programs has a substantial impact on the attributable energy savings to a program, with significant implications for the overall viability of a program (generally savings against existing building condition are higher and improve project and program cost-effectiveness).","Elsevier","","Lawrence Berkeley National Lab.

However, the additional economic benefits of building retrofits brought by ETS has not been quantitively investigated yet. Here, in order to fill this gap, this study proposed a systematic economic evaluation method to investigate the economic impacts of ETS on building retrofits. The reduction of the payback period and the increase of the return on investment are adopted as evaluation metrics. Using medium office buildings as an example, this study predicted the economic impacts of ETS on building retrofits at four locations in the U.S., and three different carbon prices were investigated. The results show that carbon prices have significant economic impacts on building retrofits. With the relatively low forecasted time-variant carbon prices (around 10 USD per ton), the economic impacts of ETS on building retrofits are small. When carbon prices increase, the impacts of ETS would be up to 25% for 50 USD per ton (current prices in European Union) and 51% for 100 USD per ton. Furthermore, locations with more fossil energy have higher relative changes in the payback period and ROI but are more sensitive to carbon prices.","Elsevier","","National Renewable Energy Lab.

The Monte Carlo Simulation (MCS) approach is a broadly used method in replacing the analytical methods in reliability indices assessment. The accuracy of MCS, however, highly depends on the sampling size, and hence, a complicated system with large number of components requires a large sampling size and daunting computational effort. To address this shortcoming, we, in this paper attempt to take advantage of potentials of the quantum computing (QC) for power system reliability assessment by realizing the following contributions: 1) an innovative quantum model designed for reliability assessment; 2) a quantum circuit that achieves the quadratic speed up compared to the classical MCS method; 3) an efficient quantum amplitude estimation (QAE) algorithm to accurately evaluate the reliability indices. The accuracy and efficacy of the quantum reliability method are extensively verified and demonstrated on both radial and mesh distribution systems.","IEEE","","Brookhaven National Lab.

Our previous study investigated different HVAC operation strategies, including increased filtration using MERV 10, MERV 13, or HEPA filters, as well as supplying 100% outdoor air into buildings for a system initially sized for MERV 10 filtration. This paper significantly extends that research by systematically analyzing the potential financial and environmental impact for different locations in the U.S. The previous medium office building system model is improved to account for operation in different climates. New evaluation metrics are created to consider the comprehensive impact of improving IAQ on costs and CO<sub>2</sub> emissions, using dynamic emission factors for electricity generation depending on the location. HVAC operation strategies are studied in five different locations across the United States, with distinct climates and electricity sources. In four of the five locations, MERV 13 filtration offers the best improvement in IAQ per increase in costs and emissions relative to MERV 10. The exception is the mildest climate of San Diego, where use of 100% outdoor air provides the best IAQ with a limited increase in costs and emissions. Finally, a system not sized for HEPA filtration can lead to increased costs and emissions without much improvement in IAQ.","Elsevier","","National Renewable Energy Lab.

First, physical-based building models are developed and simulated by using EnergyPlus. Then, power demands for a partial set of buildings simulated by EnergyPlus are used to train the GAN models. In the performance evaluation of different GANs, power demands for all buildings simulated by EnergyPlus are used as a reference. There are three main findings: (1) Original GAN and cGAN have better performance than ACGAN; (2) Original GAN has good performance even if the number of training samples is limited; and (3) cGAN has better performance when the number of building types increases. Due to the advantages of the hybrid models and GAN, a hybrid model using GAN is a promising way for a study of building power demand prediction at a large scale.","Elsevier","","National Renewable Energy Lab.

"Wood combustion nanoparticles emitted by conventional and advanced technology cordwood boilers, and their interactions in vitro with human lung epithelial monolayers","Panessa-Warren, Barbara; Butcher, Thomas; Warren, John B.; Trojanowski, Rebecca; Kisslinger, Kim; Wei, George; Celebi, Yusuf","32 ENERGY CONSERVATION, CONSUMPTION, AND UTILIZATION; boiler; biomass combustion; ultrafine particle emission; graphene; cytotoxicity; histochemistry","Biomass-burning boilers and stoves are widely used in many parts of the world, producing combustion emissions linked with health risks. Here, combustion emission nanoparticles (NPs) were collected from four representative wood burning boilers using oak cordwood at specific times in the burn cycle. The morphology and composition of the NPs was characterized using transmission electron microscopy and energy dispersive X-ray analysis. To determine the degree of NP cytotoxicity with human lung tissue, the combustion NPs were introduced to incubated lung bronchial epithelial monolayers (NCI-H292) in vitro at doses of 0.1×10<sup>-6</sup> and 3.0×10<sup>-6</sup> kg/L for 2 and 4 h. Histochemical analysis showed that cell death increased by a factor of 3.5 for both doses after 4 h when compared to the control. Ultrapure NPs prepared by wet chemical methods were also introduced to the epithelial lung cells for similar doses and exposure times and the cultures exhibited significantly reduced mortality. Electron microscopy was used to study the mechanism of cell mortality for the synthesized and combustion-based NPs by examining how the NP byproducts interacted with individual cell organelles. It was found that cell survival was strongly correlated with the absence of contaminants (salts, heavy metals, poly aromatic hydrocarbons) associated with the NPs entering the cells. Synthesized NPs consisting of pure carbon were relatively well tolerated and could be excreted without damaging the cell ultrastructure. Thus, careful removal of extraneous contaminants by controlling the burn cycle with a catalyst is essential to minimize the health and environmental effects of wood biofuel combustion.

This work studies the cost competitiveness of clean energy heating technologies under three dynamic mechanisms: investment costs, subsidy policies, and operating costs with real data. It provides key insights into the cost competitiveness of the different heating technologies deployed in different areas, as well as their sensitivity to the three dynamic mechanisms. The results show that currently, the distinct heating programs are more cost-efficient in the urban area with existing heating networks. The average payback period of all district clean energy heating programs in the urban area is 14.9 years, while that of the individual clean heating programs is 24.7 years. The individual heating programs are becoming increasingly cost-competitive with the incentive mechanisms, especially the electricity pricing mechanisms. Moreover, individual heating technologies present remarkable advantages on flexibility and sustainability in the long run. According to the technology diffusion model proposed in this paper, the individual clean heating programs will occupy more than 50% of the market share in 2050 under the comprehensive effect of CAPEX, government subsidies, and OPEX. The real-world results and analysis render references to shape the pathway of clean energy heating electrification in Northwest China and other regions with a similar situation.","Elsevier","External Audience (Unlimited)","Lawrence Livermore National Lab.

"Experimental and Numerical Study on the Effect of Nitric Oxide on Autoignition and Knock in a Direct-Injection Spark-Ignition Engine","Kim, Namho; Singh, Eshan; Sjoberg, Magnus; Saggese, Chiara; Matsubara, Naoyoshi; Yokoo, Nozomi; Nakata, Kuichi","32 ENERGY CONSERVATION, CONSUMPTION, AND UTILIZATION","We report Nitric Oxide (NO) can significantly influence the autoignition reactivity and this can affect knock limits in conventional stoichiometric SI engines. Previous studies also revealed that the role of NO changes with fuel type. Fuels with high RON (Research Octane Number) and high Octane Sensitivity (S = RON – MON (Motor Octane Number)) exhibited monotonically retarding knocklimited combustion phasing (KL-CA50) with increasing NO. In contrast, for a high-RON, low-S fuel, the addition of NO initially resulted in a strongly retarded KL-CA50 but beyond the certain amount of NO, KL-CA50 advanced again. The current study focuses on same high-RON, low-S Alkylate fuel to better understand the mechanisms responsible for the reversal in the effect of NO on KLCA50 beyond a certain amount of NO. Experiments were conducted to measure the responses of KL-CA50 and trace-autoignition CA50, the latter being indicative of CA50 at which end-gas autoignition starts to become measurable from the apparent heat-release rate. Chemical-kinetics simulations were conducted to reveal the role of NO for end-gas autoignition, with a specific focus on sequential autoignition in a thermally stratified end-gas. The simulation results reveal that the magnitude of low-temperature heat release (LTHR) generally increases with NO. However, the relative importance of NO for enhancing LTHR diminishes when the LTHR inherent to a fuel’s chemistry is strong, such as at lower temperatures in a thermal boundary layer. This rendered more uniform LTHR within a hypothetical thermal boundary and led to a more sequential (i.e. slower) autoignition event. It was also revealed that a change in compression ratio influences the importance of intermediate-temperature heat release (ITHR) due to changes of the temperature-pressure history of the end-gas. Together with the condition where end-gas autoignition occurs more sequentially, the shorter time spent in LTHR and ITHR regime can counter the increase in autoignition reactivity at high NO levels and allow KLCA50 to advance","SAE International","External Audience (Unlimited)","Lawrence Livermore National Lab.

The framework seeks to address the questions, for a given district, ""What is the best subset of buildings to connect to a district thermal energy system, and by what network should they be connected, to minimize life cycle cost?"" A particle swarm optimization approach is validated to address the selection of the subset of buildings, and a graph theory-based heuristic is validated for selection of the network topology for any candidate subset of buildings. The framework is applied to a prototypical urban district for illustrative purposes. Additionally, modeling of prototypical districts revealed reductions in source energy use intensity for heating and cooling of 21-25% through the use of advanced district energy systems relative to code-compliant, building level systems. The framework identifies solutions with life cycle cost values 14% to 72% lower than that of base case scenarios based on conventional design approaches, depending on the base case scenario selected. Analysis of the search space indicates that topology optimization facilitates reductions in life cycle cost, source energy use intensity, and carbon emissions.","Elsevier","","National Renewable Energy Lab.

While multiple efforts in the past decade have demonstrated the usefulness of the ABM approach for simulating occupants and their impacts on building performance, several crucial matters in the ABM research still remain unexplored. This paper presents ten questions that highlight the most important issues regarding ABM research and applications for occupant behavior in the context of building performance simulation. The questions and answers aim to provide insights into current and future ABM research, and more importantly to inspire new significant questions from young researchers in the field.

While these data have great potential for maximizing the energy efficiency of buildings in general, only a small portion of the data are accessible to researchers, government, and industry for analyses. Concerns about privacy are one of the major barriers prohibiting access to these data. Privacy preservation techniques are generally applied to this problem not only to preserve underlying privacy but also to improve the usefulness of data. Among various privacy preserving techniques, differential privacy has become one of the more popular solutions since its introduction in 2006. Differential privacy is a mathematical measure for protecting privacy so that one's privacy cannot be incurred by participating in a database. Additionally, although significant research improvements have been made for more than a decade, applying differential privacy to data collected in buildings is still an immature field of study. Because implementing differential privacy on a certain use case is not straightforward and can be achieved with various configurations, it is important to understand variation of configurations with different use cases around data collected from buildings. This literature review aims to introduce what has been done to implement differential privacy in data collected in buildings, and to discuss associated challenges and potential future research opportunities.","Elsevier","","National Renewable Energy Lab.

Analyzing potential scenarios for building decarbonization in different socioeconomic contexts is a crucial step to develop national and transnational roadmaps to achieve global emission reduction targets. This study integrates building stock energy models for 32 countries across four continents to create carbon emission mitigation reference scenarios and decarbonization scenarios by 2050, covering 60% of today’s global building emissions. These decarbonization pathways are compared to those from global models. Results demonstrate that reference scenarios are in all countries insufficient to achieve substantial decarbonization and lead, in some regions, to significant increases, i.e., China and South America. Decarbonization scenarios lead to substantial carbon reductions within the range projected in the 2 °C scenario but are still insufficient to achieve the decarbonization goals under the 1.5 °C scenario.","Nature Publishing Group","","National Renewable Energy Lab.

"The pursuit of net-positive sustainability for industrial decarbonization with hybrid energy systems","Zhao, Xingang; Huning, Alexander J.; Burek, Jasmina; Guo, Fengdi; Kropaczek, David J.; Pointer, W. David","32 ENERGY CONSERVATION, CONSUMPTION, AND UTILIZATION; carbon handprint; net positivity; industrial decarbonization; hybrid energy system; nuclear energy; renewable energy","We report signatories of the Paris Agreement are set to miss their climate targets. The net-zero pledges announced to date across many countries and private industries are insufficient to achieve carbon neutrality, which requires implementation of far-reaching and significantly scaled-up climate-positive actions. All technology options that pertain to deep decarbonization and carbon removal must be part of the mitigation portfolio. Transformative action plans must be established in which every individual/organization around the globe is an actor of changes in relation to net-zero goals. Such plans must involve governmental policy support but also encourage voluntary efforts to boost innovations, investments, initiatives, and behavioral changes. Recognition of these efforts is made quantifiable with the concepts of carbon handprint and net positivity. This paper presents a carbon handprint perspective on characterizing the environmental benefits of hybrid energy systems (HESs)—a widely applicable solution to cleaner production leveraging the capabilities of a portfolio of low-carbon energy sources—that provide heat and electricity to industrial processes. First, the carbon handprint and net positivity concepts and their calculation approach are introduced. The state of the art of HES-enabled industrial cogeneration is then surveyed, and the greenhouse gas emission intensities of different energy sources that power HESs are compared. Next, drawing on a case study about a US chemical facility's voluntary initiative to explore replacing its fossil fuel–based cogeneration infrastructure with a clean energy–generated HES, several technically viable scenarios are evaluated—especially those with small modular nuclear reactors—to illustrate how the positive-thinking handprint approach helps encourage and inform the search for widespread influence pathways in pursuit of net-positive sustainability. Finally, current knowledge gaps in the case study are identified, and opportunities to scale up the proposed handprint-based analysis are outlined with consideration of an expanded role of HESs in fulfilling climate objectives.It is envisioned that like-minded decision makers in the industry sector and beyond will adopt this perspective and act synergistically to enhance their environmental stewardship through voluntary actions and make greater contributions to the planet's climate future.","Elsevier","","Oak Ridge National Lab.

Especially with increasing penetration of variable renewable generation, demand response (DR) can also provide system value and support the evolving needs of the grid. Yet there has been little study to date of interactions between EE and DR that may complicate their grid impacts. In this study we perform bottom-up modelling of the interactive effects between EE and DR in buildings for three representative regions of the United States electricity grid. Leveraging new simulation tools that enable detailed modelling of the building stock, we synthesize system-level demand profiles for several scenarios representing different portfolios of EE measures. In each scenario, we couple the underlying building models with a database of DR-enabling technologies to estimate building-level DR capabilities and compute a system-level supply curve for DR. We assess the resulting EE and DR interactive effects based on an existing conceptual framework. The results show a complex relationship between EE and DR, with interactive effects whose size and direction can vary widely depending on the grid system, type of DR, and the framework level being considered. Most often, the overall effect is competition between EE and DR, but significant complementarity can also occur, especially when the EE portfolio includes controls measures. Our results suggest that EE and DR programs developed without considering interactive effects may erode the benefits of both resources, whereas a more integrated approach may yield increased benefits.","Elsevier","","National Renewable Energy Lab.

This study couples charging and repositioning events as a means of improving service quality (rider wait times), reducing empty travel due to repositioning or charging, and improving fleet utilization (average daily trips per vehicle and charging queues). This synergy is explored for the Austin, Texas region using POLARIS, an agent-based model. On average, wait times were 39% lower, and average daily trips served per SAEV increased up to 6.4 (or 28%) compared to SAEV repositioning with heuristic charging. Coupling repositioning with charging decreased the fleet's percent empty travel on average by 1.6%, relative to the scenario treating them as independent events (which varies by charging station design). Sparser charging stations reduce investment costs, and operators can leverage this framework to keep traveler wait times low.","Elsevier","","Argonne National Lab.

Here, three partially charged ternary blends consisting of symmetric poly[(oligo(ethylene glycol) methyl ether methacrylate-co-oligo(ethylene glycol) propyl sodium sulfonate methacrylate)] (POEGMA#), polystyrene (PS), and POEGMA#-PS with different charge fractions were prepared, where # denotes the mole fraction of charged monomers in the POEGMA chain. The phase behavior was systematically studied using small-angle X-ray scattering, and isothermal phase diagrams at 120 °C were constructed. The resulting isothermal planes contain a wide lamellar phase window with a slight deviation from symmetry for ion-containing ternary blends due to the homopolymer size difference. Given the absence of any significant change in the phase diagrams as the charge fraction increases, the role of charge is primarily to increase the segregation strength in the ternary system, as in the case of partially charged diblock polymers. In addition, examination of the increase in domain size along the volumetrically symmetric isopleth reveals a “dry-brush”-like swelling behavior of homopolymers in all three blends, presumably due to the space-filling nature of the oligomeric ethylene glycol side chains on POEGMA.","American Chemical Society","","Univ. of Minnesota, Twin Cities, MN (United States)","USDOE Office of Science (SC); National Science Foundation (NSF); NNCI","","United States","2022-05-27T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: Macromolecules; Journal Volume: 55; Journal Issue: 11","","Medium: ED; Size: p. 4766-4775","","","SC0017809; AC02-06CH11357; DMR-2011401; ECCS-2025124","Journal ID: ISSN 0024-9297","10.1021/acs.macromol.2c00518","","2022-07-11T00:00:00Z","1874678","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/1874678","","Macromolecules","11","55"

The case studies consist of real occupied buildings that have been monitored as part of the International Energy Agency (IEA) SHC Task 61/EBC Annex 77 Programme. The general goal of the case studies was to balance lighting energy use with occupants’ visual and non-visual requirements. This was achieved using innovative solutions for daylighting and electric lighting with advanced controls, but also implementing simple and out-of-the-box strategies. The findings suggest that energy demands for lighting can significantly be reduced by combining sensible daylight provision, efficient lighting sources, and advances in controls. Yet, the effective achievement of project goals requires adequate monitoring, fine-tuning, and verification. The findings also suggest that the adoption of “integrative” lighting – that is, lighting systems that address both visual and non-visual responses – is getting increasingly popular. Catering to non-visual requirements will likely drive further innovation in lighting technology. Currently, there is limited investment available for developing daylighting systems for integrative lighting, and the current related electric strategies often come at the risk of energy rebound effects. Overall, providing daylighting and understanding user requirements are fundamental steps towards achieving quality projects, with potential benefits beyond saving energy.","Elsevier","","Lawrence Berkeley National Lab.

The DC-link current minimization can significantly reduce power loss and improve efficiency. The challenge of this problem is on improving both steady-state and dynamic performance. PI control methods and large DC-link inductors are conventionally used in the CSC but have limited dynamic performance. A model predictive control (MPC) method is proposed to achieve switching-cycle-level settling time, and the DC-link inductor is sized for 40% ripple to enable fast current change. Importantly, this article also proposes to minimize the DC-link current by varying the current even within a line cycle under single-phase load to improve the steady-state performance, in contrast with the reduction to a constant value in the literature. The proposed MPC features a constant switching frequency without weighting factors. The MPC does not have a high computational burden and is implemented in a regular digital controller for a prototype of soft-switching solid-state transformer (S4T) with reduced conduction loss. The effectiveness of the proposed method has been experimentally verified on the SiC S4T prototype during steady-state and dynamics under different multiport power flow conditions up to 2 kV peak. Here, the DC-link current in the experiments is close to the minimum current with a short zero-vector duration, which further verifies the performance of the proposed method.","IEEE","","Georgia Institute of Technology, Atlanta, GA (United States)","USDOE Advanced Research Projects Agency - Energy (ARPA-E)","","United States","2022-05-27T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: IEEE Transactions on Power Electronics; Journal Volume: 37; Journal Issue: 10","","Medium: ED; Size: p. 11865-11875","","","AR0000899","Journal ID: ISSN 0885-8993","10.1109/tpel.2022.3178433","","2022-10-20T00:00:00Z","1892472","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/1892472","","IEEE Transactions on Power Electronics","10","37"
"Real time side-by-side experimental validation of energy and comfort performance of a zero net energy retrofit package for small commercial buildings","Fernandes, Luís L.; Regnier, Cynthia M.","32 ENERGY CONSERVATION, CONSUMPTION, AND UTILIZATION; zero net energy; retrofit; energy conservation measures; energy efficiency; small commercial; office; experimental study","Making buildings zero-net energy (ZNE) is one of the major strategies for achieving carbon emission reduction goals. For this strategy to be successful, it entails a very significant reduction in energy use – 50% or more. In small commercial buildings, however, owners and building management teams usually have limited resources for identifying, analyzing, and procuring appropriate retrofit measures for reducing such use. An approach to overcome this limitation is the development of bundles of energy efficiency measures that can be presented to building owners/operators as a comprehensive package. The research presented in this paper focuses on an experimental evaluation of the impacts of a retrofit package developed for small office buildings in California. Performing this evaluation in a full-scale whole-building integrated systems test facility allowed a side-by-side evaluation in real time, against a reference case, of the impact of the retrofit package not only on energy use but also on visual and thermal comfort. Here, the retrofit package evaluated is comprised of a combination of HVAC, lighting (including daylighting), and plug load measures. The evaluation occurred at different times of the year in order to account for seasonal variations in environmental conditions, including solar angles and weather. The experimental facility allowed testing for two different façade orientations: south and west. Results show that the proposed ZNE retrofit package can save significant amounts of energy for small commercial buildings. During cooling-prevalent periods, total energy savings were 65% for south orientation and 68% for west orientation; during heating-prevalent periods total energy savings were 22% for south orientation and 25% for west orientation. Measurements indicate that the ZNE retrofit package resulted in small but not very significant changes in comfort levels for building occupants.","Elsevier","","Lawrence Berkeley National Lab.

"A fast and accurate modeling approach for water and steam thermodynamics with practical applications in district heating system simulation","Hinkelman, Kathryn; Anbarasu, Saranya; Wetter, Michael; Gautier, Antoine; Zuo, Wangda","32 ENERGY CONSERVATION, CONSUMPTION, AND UTILIZATION; 97 MATHEMATICS AND COMPUTING; 42 ENGINEERING; computing speed; district heating; modelica; modeling; simulation; steam","In U.S. district heating (DH) systems, steam is the most common heat transport medium. Industry demand for new advanced modeling capabilities of complete steam DH systems is increasing; however, the existing models for water/steam thermodynamics are too slow for large system simulations because of computationally expensive algebraic loops that require the solution to nonlinear systems of equations. For practical applications, this work presents a novel split-medium approach that implements numerically efficient liquid water models alongside various water/steam models, breaking costly algebraic loops by decoupling mass and energy balance equations. New component models for steam DH systems are also presented. We implemented the models in the equation based Modelica language and evaluated accuracy and computing speed across multiple scales: from fundamental thermodynamic properties to complete districts featuring 10 to 200 buildings. Compared to district models with the IF97 water/steam model and equipment models from the Modelica Standard Library, the new implementation improves the scaling rate for large districts from cubic to quadratic with negligible compromise to accuracy. Additionally, for an annual simulation with 180 buildings, this translates to a computing time reduction from 33 to 1-1.5 h. These results are critically important for industry practitioners to simulate steam DH systems at large scales.","Elsevier","","National Renewable Energy Lab.

We propose a Probabilistic Bidirectional Recurrent Network (PBRN) for industrial process monitoring for the early detection of faults. The model is based on a Gated Recurrent Unit (GRU) neural network that allows the model to retain long-term dependencies between sensor data along a time horizon, hence learning the dynamic behavior of the process. To reduce the false-positive detection rate of the model, we compel the model to learn from a highly noisy sensor reading while outputting noise-free sensor outputs. The performance of the proposed model is compared to other data-driven statistical process monitoring schemes using real plant data from an industrial Air Separations Unit (ASU) containing noisy sensor readings. We show that the model can learn from noisy data without reducing its performance. Using two different fault cases, we demonstrate the model’s ability to carry out early fault detection with average false-positive rates of 2.9% and 4.9% for both fault cases. The missed detection rates are 0.1% and 0.2%, respectively.","American Institute of Chemical Engineers (AIChE), Wiley","","Univ. of California, Los Angeles, CA (United States)","USDOE Office of Energy Efficiency and Renewable Energy (EERE); CESMII","","United States","2022-05-09T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: Journal of Advanced Manufacturing and Processing; Journal Volume: 4; Journal Issue: 4","","Medium: ED; Size: Article No. e10124","","","EE0007613; 4550-G-WA324","Journal ID: ISSN 2637-403X","10.1002/amp2.10124","","2023-03-14T00:00:00Z","1868938","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/1868938","","Journal of Advanced Manufacturing and Processing","4","4"

Existing data schemas focus on metadata of sensors, meters, physical equipment, and IoT devices in buildings; however, they are limited in representing the metadata of occupant data, including occupants' presence in spaces, movement between spaces, interactions with building systems or IoT devices, and preference of indoor environmental needs. To address this gap, an extension to the widely adopted metadata schema, Brick, is proposed to represent the contextual, behavioral, and demographic information of occupants. The proposed extension includes four parts: (1) a new “Occupant” class to represent occupants' demography and energy related behavioral patterns, (2) new subclasses under the Equipment class to represent envelope system and personal thermal comfort devices, (3) new subclasses under the Point class to represent occupant sensing and status, and (4) new auxiliary properties for occupant interactable equipment to represent the level of controllability for each piece of equipment by occupants. The extension is implemented in the Brick schema and has been tested using multiple occupant datasets from the ASHRAE Global Occupant Database. The extension enables Brick schema to capture diverse types of occupant sensing data and their metadata for FAIR data research and applications.","Elsevier","","Lawrence Berkeley National Lab.

"Data-Enabled Predictive Control for Building HVAC Systems","Chinde, Venkatesh; Lin, Yashen; Ellis, Matthew J.","32 ENERGY CONSERVATION, CONSUMPTION, AND UTILIZATION; air conditioning; buildings; heating; HVAC; model predictive control; MPC; ventilation","Model predictive control is widely used as a control technology for the computation of optimal control inputs of building heating, ventilating, and air conditioning (HVAC) systems. However, both the benefits and widespread adoption of model predictive control (MPC) are hindered by the effort of model creation, calibration, and accuracy of the predictions. In this paper, we apply the data-enabled predictive control (DeePC) algorithm for designing controls for building HVAC systems. The algorithm solely depends on input/output data from the system to predict future state trajectories without the need for system identification. The algorithm relies on the idea that a vector space of all input–output trajectories of a discrete-time linear time-invariant (LTI) system is spanned by time-shifts of a single measured trajectory, given the input signal is persistently exciting. Closed-loop simulations using EnergyPlus are performed to demonstrate the approach. The simulated building modeled in EnergyPlus is a modified commercial large office prototype building served by an air handling unit-variable air volume HVAC system. Temperature setpoints of zones are used as control variables to minimize the HVAC energy cost of the building considering a time-of-use electricity rate structure. Furthermore, sensitivity analysis is conducted to gain insights into the effect of parameter tuning on DeePC performance. Simulation results are used to illustrate the performance of the algorithm and compare the algorithm with model-based MPC and occupancy-based setpoint controller. Overall, DeePC achieves similar performance compared to MPC for lower engineering effort.","ASME","","National Renewable Energy Lab.

The proposed SST has some unique features. First, compared to the voltage-source or matrix converter-based SSTs, the current-source SST has a unique advantage of single-stage isolated AC/DC or AC/AC conversion with an inductive DC link, but no medium-voltage (MV) AC experiments have been reported. This article for the first time demonstrates MV AC current-source SST up to 7.5 kV peak. Second, the multiport SST has a buffer port for active power decoupling (APD) or energy storage integration. The double-line-frequency power ripple from single-phase AC grid normally results in a large capacitor size in MV SSTs. The APD scheme is proposed in MV applications for the first time to enable a reduced DC link and the electrolytic capacitor-less SST with high reliability. Third, as a direct grid-connected converter without line-frequency transformer, insulation and protection are critical. A medium-frequency transformer design passes 55 kV basic-insulation level (BIL) and 60 kV high potential dielectrics withstand test with only 0.09% leakage inductance. Importantly, a lightning protection scheme is presented to protect the SST itself from 90 kV BIL impulse. Fourth, the proposed current-source SST topology is a modular soft-switching solid-state transformer (M-S4T) with full-range zero-voltage switching and controlled dv/dt for low electromagnetic interference. Furthermore, these concepts are verified in a three-port M-S4T prototype with forced oil cooling under single-module, stacked-module, steady-state, and dynamic operations.","IEEE","","Georgia Institute of Technology, Atlanta, GA (United States)","USDOE Advanced Research Projects Agency - Energy (ARPA-E)","","United States","2022-05-06T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: IEEE Transactions on Power Electronics; Journal Volume: 37; Journal Issue: 10","","Medium: ED; Size: p. 12080-12094","","","AR0000899","Journal ID: ISSN 0885-8993","10.1109/tpel.2022.3172946","","2022-10-20T00:00:00Z","1892474","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/1892474","","IEEE Transactions on Power Electronics","10","37"

One critical issue of the single-phase SST is the double-line-frequency power ripple. Traditionally, large passives are used to buffer the ripple, resulting in significantly increased volume and cost. This article for the first time proposes active power decoupling (APD) for the SST and a predictive direct DC-link control method, using a current-source single-stage SST as an example. An electrolytic capacitor-less buffer port is used to absorb the ripple, which tolerates up to a 30% voltage ripple for small capacitance. The APD SST control is challenging. First, the current-source SST realizes isolation, DC link, and multiport in a single stage. Second, different from conventional SSTs or APD converters, the low-inertia DC link in this SST has a 40% switching ripple, which is difficult to stabilize. To address the control challenge, a direct DC-link control architecture and a predictive control method are proposed. Simulation and experimental results verify the proposed control method on an MV SiC modular soft-switching solid-state transformer (M-S4T) prototype. Here, the proposed APD reduces the SST volume by 53.8%. Importantly, the proposed concept is not limited to the M-S4T but is generic to other SSTs or APD converters.","IEEE","","Georgia Institute of Technology, Atlanta, GA (United States)","USDOE Advanced Research Projects Agency - Energy (ARPA-E)","","United States","2022-05-06T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: IEEE Transactions on Power Electronics; Journal Volume: 37; Journal Issue: 10","","Medium: ED; Size: p. 11673-11685","","","AR0000899","Journal ID: ISSN 0885-8993","10.1109/tpel.2022.3172957","","2022-10-20T00:00:00Z","1892473","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/1892473","","IEEE Transactions on Power Electronics","10","37"

However, due to a very large number of entities within organizational access control (AC) systems, static RBAC management can be inefficient, costly, and can lead to cybersecurity threats. In this paper, a novel hybrid RBAC model is proposed, based on the principles of offline deep reinforcement learning (RL) and Bayesian belief networks. The considered framework utilizes a fully offline RL agent, which models the behavioral history of users as a Bayesian belief-based trust indicator. Thus, the initial static RBAC policy is improved in a dynamic manner through off-policy learning while guaranteeing compliance of the internal users with the security rules of the system. By deploying our implementation within the smart grid domain and specifically within a Distributed Energy Resources (DER) ecosystem, we provide an end-to-end proof of concept of our model.

"MPC solution for optimal load shifting for buildings with ON/OFF staged packaged units: Experimental demonstration, and lessons learned","Kim, Donghun; Braun, James E.","32 ENERGY CONSERVATION, CONSUMPTION, AND UTILIZATION; Model predictive control; Staged units; Packaged air conditioner; Load shifting; Load flexibility","Small and medium-sized commercial buildings (SMCB) are significant demand response resources, and it is important to develop grid-responsive control algorithms that exploit those resources and create financial benefits for building owners and HVAC service providers. Furthermore, unlike large-sized commercial buildings, there is an opportunity to have universally applicable control solutions for many SMCBs since those buildings have a consistent HVAC system configuration: SMCBs are commonly served by multiple-staged air conditioning units controlled by their own thermostats. Despite the demand response potential and scalability, however, very few control solutions are available for SMCBs. Typical model predictive control (MPC) and heuristic control approaches for cooling load shifting that lower thermostat setpoints before an electric price jump are suitable mainly for large-sized commercial buildings where a continuous capacity modulation is possible, e.g., via dampers in variable air volume terminal units. However, those approaches can cause undesired, high peaks for SMCBs due to the nature of ON/OFF unit staging and narrow thermostat deadbands. This could discourage the use of advanced grid-responsive controls for SMCBs due to the concern of high demand charges, and has to be resolved. This paper presents a MPC solution that overcomes this challenge. It has a hierarchical MPC structure where an upper level MPC is responsible for electrical load shifting in response to an electric price signal while a lower level MPC is responsible for coordinating compressor stages to eliminate unnecessary peaks and follows the setpoints determined by the upper level MPC. In this work, two one-month, comprehensive laboratory tests have been carried out to demonstrate load shifting and cost savings for the algorithm. Interesting trade-offs between energy efficiency and load flexibility were observed and are discussed, and lessons learned for applying MPCs for SMCBs are also presented.","Elsevier","","Lawrence Berkeley National Lab.

Optimally managing home energy consumption is an effective way of easing the operational challenges facing the electric grid with increasing solar photovoltaics (PV). This paper studies the impact of the future proliferation of home energy management systems (HEMS) in the presence of PV on large-scale distribution systems. First, we present a stochastic HEMS model that minimizes residential customers' thermal discomfort and energy costs under uncertainty. The HEMS model schedules the optimal operations of residential appliances in the presence of PV within a mixed-integer linear programming-based model predictive control framework that links the proposed HEMS to a quasi-steady-state time-series simulation tool. Additionally, extensive simulations are conducted for a stand-alone residential home using two tariff structures and for 1977 homes on an 8,500-node distribution feeder. Simulation results quantify the impact of the future proliferation of HEMS on the large-scale distribution system with PV.","Elsevier","","National Renewable Energy Lab.

This model system consisted of three photo-cross-linkable diblock polymers of poly(methoxyethyl acrylate)-b-poly(hexyl methacrylate-co-coumarin methacrylate) with different volume fractions of the cross-linkable coumarin-containing block, which microphase separated into lamellar and cylindrical morphologies. All polymers stiffened upon exposure to 365 nm light, with much greater relative increases in moduli recorded for lamellae-forming polymers (ca. 3200% increase) compared to the cylinder-forming polymer (ca. 550% increase). Disordering transitions that were evident in un-cross-linked samples were no longer observed after cross-linking in the ordered state, and domain sizes were found to remain stable to heating. The photo-cross-linking reaction only proceeded under active irradiation (i.e., cross-linking does not persist when the UV radiation is turned off), indicating a high degree of spatiotemporal control over curing in this system. Finally, at constant concentration of couamarin within the cross-linkable block, the cure rate was largely independent of polymer composition, suggesting a constant local concentration of coumarin moieties within the segregated cross-linkable domains. These findings establish a set of specific structure–property relationships governing the phase-selective photo-cross-linking of diblock polymers that can guide the design of robust nanostructured materials.","American Chemical Society","","Univ. of Minnesota, Twin Cities, MN (United States)","USDOE Office of Science (SC), Basic Energy Sciences (BES); National Science Foundation (NSF)","","United States","2022-04-15T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: Macromolecules; Journal Volume: 55; Journal Issue: 8","","Medium: ED; Size: p. 3317-3324","","","SC0017809; DMR-2011401","Journal ID: ISSN 0024-9297","10.1021/acs.macromol.2c00356","","2023-04-17T00:00:00Z","1874679","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/1874679","https://www.osti.gov/servlets/purl/1874679","Macromolecules","8","55"

In this research, a novel optimal control approach is proposed to evaluate the maximum theoretical energy and cost-saving potential of AISs. A time-varying model predictive control (TV-MPC) controller was used to optimally select the AIS mode and simultaneously determine the operation of the heating, ventilation and air conditioning (HVAC) system so that the maximum saving potential of the entire system can be realized. To comprehensively evaluate the power shifting flexibility of AISs, two optimization objectives—minimizing weekly electric energy consumption and minimizing weekly electricity cost—were considered. The summer season simulation results show that under the first objective, more than 50% electric and thermal energy was saved when the upper boundary of the indoor air temperature was set to 25 °C. Furthermore under the second optimization objective, 38% of the cost was saved. It can be expected that the developed approach can be easily applied to multiple types of AISs with different mechanisms.","Elsevier","","Oak Ridge National Lab.

Here, we estimate and compare the geospatially-distributed cost of CPG and CO <sub>2</sub> storage across a portion of North America. We find that the locations with lowest-cost CO <sub>2</sub> storage are different than the locations with lowest-cost CPG. There are also locations with low-cost CO <sub>2</sub> storage (&lt;$5/tCO <sub>2</sub> ) that do not support CPG power generation due to insufficient reservoir transmissivity or temperature. Thus, CPG development may require electricity prices that are greater than the levelized cost of electricity (LCOE) to offset the increased cost of sequestration. We introduce the “Additional Cost of Electricity (ACOE)” metric to account for this cost and add it to the LCOE to calculate breakeven electricity prices that are required for CPG development. We find that breakeven prices are lower when new CO <sub>2</sub> injection wells are drilled specifically for CPG (i.e., “greenfield” CPG development) compared to if only existing CO <sub>2</sub> sequestration injection wells are used (i.e., “brownfield” CPG development). This is because comparatively few wells are needed for sequestration-only, and the increased power capacity from having more CPG wells outweighs the increased costs from more drilling. We also find that sequestered CO <sub>2</sub> could be used to approximately triple the United States geothermal electricity power capacity via a single CPG “sweet spot” in South Dakota, but that breakeven electricity price for this development is on the order of $200/MW <sub>e</sub> h. </p>","Frontiers Media SA","","Carbon Solutions LLC, Bloomington, IN (United States)","USDOE Office of Science (SC), Engineering & Technology.

With fast-growing sensing data availability and advancement in computing, computational modeling has demonstrated strong capability to detect and diagnose HVAC system faults, hence, ensuring efficient building operation. This paper comprehensively reviews the state-of-the-art computing-based fault detection and diagnosis (FDD) for HVAC systems. Overall, the reviewed computing-based FDD methods are classified as two major approaches: knowledge-based and data-driven approaches. We then identify multiple important topics, including data availability, training data size, data quality, approach generality, capability, interpretability, and required modeling efforts, along with corresponding metrics to summarize the most updated FDD development. Generally, the knowledge-based approaches are further divided as physics-based modeling, Diagnostic Bayesian Network, and performance indicator-based methods while data-driven approaches include supervised learning, unsupervised learning, and regression and statistics-based methods. State-of-the-art FDD development, remaining challenges, and future research directions are further discussed to push forward FDD in practice. Availability of fault data, capability of existing methods to deal with complex fault situations (such as simultaneous faults), modeling interpretability for data-driven methods, and required engineering efforts for physics-based methods are identified as remaining challenges in FDD development. Improving modeling fidelity and reducing modeling efforts are essential for applying physics-based methods in real buildings. Meanwhile, addressing fault data availability, increasing algorithm adaptability, and handling multiple faults are essential to further enhance the applicability of data-driven FDD approaches.","Elsevier","","National Renewable Energy Lab.

In parallel, increasingly urgent demands to sharply reduce building energy use and associated greenhouse gas emissions are being made to mitigate climate change. There are many challenges and performance tradeoffs associated with the building facade (i.e., daylight and view versus solar and glare control); increased prioritization of health and well-being as a fundamental human requirement could adversely affect building energy-efficiency. Given the current state of knowledge on the effects of daylight and view on health and well-being in buildings, we identify critical needs in research, tools and technologies that if satisfied may enable more effective use of daylight and view in buildings within the constraints of climate change. Lack of knowledge regarding the complex causal mechanisms of window views on human factors is a severely limiting factor in forward progress. Current models and methods to derive bidirectional scattering distribution functions (BSDFs) will need to be modified. Developers of energy-efficient window technologies will need more guidance to shape product development. Advanced window technologies and integrated design can enable attainment of both health and well-being and net zero energy goals, but considerable work will be needed to make such options turnkey and broadly available.","Elsevier","","Lawrence Berkeley National Lab.

However, the impacts of representing sub-grid topographic effects in land surface models (LSMs) on the surface energy balance and surface boundary conditions remain unclear. Recently, a topography-based sub-grid structure and a method to account for the sub-grid topographic effects on solar radiation have been incorporated in the Energy Exascale Earth System Model (E3SM) land model (ELM). This study analyzed and evaluated the impacts of sub-grid topographic representations on surface energy balance and turbulent heat flux and scalar (co-)variances in ELM. Three sub-grid topographic representations in ELM were compared: (1) the default sub-grid structure (denoted as D) at 0.5° resolution that does not account for the sub-grid topographic variability, (2) the recently developed sub-grid topographic structure (denoted as T) at 0.5° resolution that parsimoniously resolves the sub-grid topographic variability, and (3) high spatial resolution (denoted as 1KM) to explicitly resolve the fine-scale topography at 1 km resolution. Additionally, two different solar radiation schemes in ELM were compared: (1) the default plane-parallel radiative transfer scheme (PP) that neglects the sub-grid topographic effects and (2) the parameterization scheme (TOP) that accounts for sub-grid topographic effects on solar radiation. A series of simulations with the three grid structures (i.e. D, T and 1KM) and the two different treatments of solar radiation (i.e., TOP and PP) were carried out using the Sierra Nevada, California, as case study, which is representative of a region with complex terrain. The results show significant differences between TOP and PP in the 1 km simulated surface energy balance, but the differences in the mean values and standard deviations become small when aggregated to the grid-scale (i.e., 0.5°). The T configuration can better mimic the 1KM simulations than the D configuration, and can better capture the sub-grid topographic effects on the mean values and standard deviations of surface energy balance as well as the surface boundary conditions for turbulent heat fluxes and scalar (co-)variances. These results underline the importance of representing sub-grid topographic heterogeneities in LSMs and motivate future research to understand the sub-grid topographic effects on land-atmosphere interactions over mountain areas.","American Geophysical Union (AGU)","","Pacific Northwest National Lab.

In this study, we use detailed process-based building energy modeling of over 1.1 million buildings in Los Angeles along with a high-resolution urban micro-climate modeling framework to assess the implications of anthropogenic heating for urban micro-climate dynamics and the feedback process between them. We uniquely distinguish between two major components of anthropogenic heating from HVAC system rejections and exhaust/relief air from buildings. We show that the less-studied anthropogenic heating from building exhaust, compared to that from HVAC systems, is mostly a nocturnal phenomenon with more significant implications for local air temperature due to the lower and more stable planetary boundary layer at night. We demonstrate that anthropogenic heating from HVAC rejection and building exhaust not only have reverse diurnal profiles, they also exhibit offsetting behaviors under increasing outdoor temperatures. Our results show that a detailed understanding of the composition of anthropogenic heating, specific to an urban environment, is required to predict its' diurnal dynamics and its’ response to a warming climate.","Elsevier","","Lawrence Berkeley National Lab.

"Numerical Modeling of Atmospheric Rime Ice Accretion on an Airfoil Using an Eulerian Approach","Shad, Arash; Sherif, S. A.","32 ENERGY CONSERVATION, CONSUMPTION, AND UTILIZATION; ice accretion; Rime ice; glaze ice; airfoil; aircraft wing; aircraft icing; icing; atmospheric; heat transfer; dynamic mesh; CFD","This paper presents an approach to numerically simulate the inherently unsteady rime ice accretion problem on a two-dimensional airfoil and elucidate the associated variations under different icing conditions. The airflow field and the water impingement on the airfoil are obtained based on an Eulerian two-phase model. A dynamic mesh strategy is employed to unsteadily account for the changes in the ice profile and its impact on the air and droplet flow by continuously reconstructing the computational grid at each time-step through smoothing and layering mechanisms. All main icing modules including the airflow field, droplet trajectory, icing thickness profile, and mesh management are fully coupled within the same computational framework without resorting to any external tools. Classical icing theory is employed to model the rime ice roughness, and it is assumed that the ice accretes in a direction normal to the airfoil surface. The governing Reynolds-averaged Navier–Stokes (RANS) conservation equations along with the energy and continuity equations are solved to produce the velocity and temperature fields. A convective film heat transfer coefficient is computed based on the surface heat flux and a recovery temperature which takes into account the dissipative heat release in the boundary layer in the vicinity of the airfoil surface. With the implemented strategy and calculating the convective heat transfer coefficient, the water film thickness is also calculated along with the ice shape. Furthermore, the model is validated by comparing the local collection efficiency distribution and ice shape with experimental data, and the results show that the implemented approach provides acceptable predictions of ice accretion profiles and rates.","ASME","","Univ. of Florida, Gainesville, FL (United States)","USDOE Office of Energy Efficiency and Renewable Energy (EERE), Energy Efficiency Office.

"Carbon emission responsive building control: A case study with an all-electric residential community in a cold climate","Wang, Jing; Munankarmi, Prateek; Maguire, Jeff; Shi, Chengnan; Zuo, Wangda; Roberts, David; Jin, Xin","32 ENERGY CONSERVATION, CONSUMPTION, AND UTILIZATION; building control; carbon accounting; decarbonization; residential community; rule-based control","In the United States, buildings account for 35% of total energy-related carbon dioxide emissions, making them important contributors to decarbonization. Carbon intensities in the power grid are time-varying and can fluctuate significantly within hours, so shifting building loads in response to the carbon intensities can reduce a building’s operational carbon emissions. This paper presents a rule-based carbon responsive control framework that controls the setpoints of thermostatically controlled loads responding to the grid’s carbon emission signals in real time. Based on this framework, four controllers are proposed with different combinations of carbon accounting methods and control rules. To evaluate their performance, we performed simulation studies using models of a 27-home, all-electric, net zero energy residential community located in Basalt, Colorado, United States. The carbon intensity data of four future years from the Cambium data set are adopted to account for the evolving resource mix in the power grid. Various performance metrics, including energy consumption, carbon emission, energy cost, and thermal discomfort, were used to evaluate the performance of the controllers. Sensitivity analysis was also conducted to determine how the control thresholds and intervals affect the controllers’ performance. Simulation results indicate that the carbon responsive controllers can reduce the homes’ annual carbon emissions by 6.0% to 20.5%. However, the energy consumption increased by 0.9% to 6.7%, except in one scenario where it decreased by 2.2%. Compared to the baseline, the change in energy cost was between –2.9% and 3.4%, and thermal discomfort was also maintained within an acceptable range. The little impact on energy cost and thermal discomfort indicates there are no potential roadblocks for customer acceptance when rolling out the controllers in utility programs.","Elsevier","","National Renewable Energy Lab.

We undertake a data-driven approach to explore the energy impacts of work-from-home norms across five dwelling typologies. Our methodology includes climate correction, dimensionality reduction and machine learning-based clustering using Gaussian Mixture Models of daily load curves. Results show that during the lockdown, maximum daily peak demand increased by 150-200% as compared to 2018 and 2019 levels for one room-units (RM1), one bedroom-units (BR1) and two bedroom-units (BR2) which are typical for low- and middle-income families. While the upper-middle- and higher-income dwelling units (i.e., three (3BR) and more-than-three bedroom-units (M3BR)) saw night-time demand rise by almost 44% in 2020, as compared to 2018 and 2019 levels. Our results also showed that new peak demand emerged for the lockdown period for RM1, BR1 and BR2 dwelling typologies. We found that the lack of supporting socioeconomic and climatic data can restrict a comprehensive analysis of demand shocks using similar public datasets, which informed policy implications for India's digitalisation. We further emphasised improving the data quality and reliability for effective data-centric policymaking.","Elsevier","","Lawrence Berkeley National Lab.

Here, in order to represent market gasoline (RD5-87), a four-component toluene primary reference fuel (TPRF) + ethanol (ETPRF) surrogate (with 20% ethanol by mole; E20) was formulated using a neural network based octane predictor such that the surrogate had the same ethanol content, Research Octane Number (RON) and Octane Sensitivity (S). In addition, a novel skeletal kinetic mechanism for ETPRF and TPRF + n-butanol (BTPRF) blends, incorporating polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon (PAH) chemistry, was developed. A three-dimensional (3D) engine CFD formulation employing the skeletal mechanism, adaptive mesh refinement (AMR), finite-rate chemistry approach, and hybrid method of moments (HMOM) was adopted to capture the in-cylinder combustion phenomena and soot emissions. The engine CFD model was validated against RD5-87 experimental data for a broad range of start-of-injection (SOI) timings (-21/-27/-36/-45 crank angle degrees (CAD) after top-dead center (aTDC)), with respect to in-cylinder pressure, heat release rate, combustion phasing, and soot emissions. The closed-cycle simulation results were analyzed to elucidate the non-monotonic trend of soot emissions versus SOI timing: SOI-36 > SOI-45 > SOI-21 > SOI-27. Thereafter, the validated CFD model was employed to simulate the combustion of a gasoline-ethanol blend with 45% (by mole) ethanol (E45) and a gasoline-butanol blend with 45% (by mole) n-butanol (B45) under the same operating conditions to study the effects of fuel composition and SOI timing on combustion phasing and soot emissions. The sooting propensity followed the trend: B45 > E20 > E45 at all SOI timings. Overall, it was observed that the autoignition propensity was primarily related to fuel chemistry. On the other hand, sooting propensity showed strong coupling with both fuel chemistry and physical properties, with greater impact of fuel physical properties at advanced SOI timings.","Elsevier","External Audience (Unlimited)","Lawrence Livermore National Lab.

Air conditioning accounts for a large portion of global greenhouse gas emissions today, which we estimate at 3.9%; however, the role that humidity plays in these emissions is often overlooked. Here, we show that the emissions associated with reducing air humidity (i.e., removing water vapor from air) are larger than emissions associated with reducing air temperature (i.e., cooling air). We calculate these emissions for today and 2050 and show how dramatically humidity-related emissions will increase with rising cooling demand around the world. We also calculate the minimum separation energy for removing water vapor from air and find that this is at least an order of magnitude less than the processes used today.","Elsevier - Cell Press","","National Renewable Energy Lab.

"Heterogeneous climate change impacts on electricity demand in world cities circa mid-century","Romitti, Yasmin; Wing, Ian Sue","54 ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCES; 32 ENERGY CONSERVATION, CONSUMPTION, AND UTILIZATION; Climate-change impacts; Energy supply and demand","Rising ambient temperatures due to climate change will increase urban populations’ exposures to extreme heat. During hot hours, a key protective adaptation is increased air conditioning and associated consumption of electricity for cooling. But during cold hours, milder temperatures have the offsetting effect of reducing consumption of electricity and other fuels for heating. We elucidate the net consequences of these opposing effects in 36 cities in different world regions. We couple reduced-form statistical models of cities’ hourly responses of electric load to temperature with temporally downscaled projections of temperatures simulated by 21 global climate models (GCMs), projecting the effects of warming on the demand for electricity circa 2050. Cities' responses, temperature exposures and impacts are heterogeneous, with changes in total annual consumption ranging from –2.7 to 5.7%, and peak power demand increasing by as much as 9.5% at the multi-GCM median. The largest increases are concentrated in more economically developed mid-latitude cities, with less developed urban areas in the tropics exhibiting relatively small changes. The results highlight the important role of the structure of electricity demand: large temperature increases in tropical cities are offset by their inelastic responses, which can be attributed to lower air-conditioning penetration.","Nature Publishing Group","","Boston Univ., MA (United States)","USDOE Office of Science (SC), Biological and Environmental Research (BER)","","United States","2022-03-11T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: Scientific Reports; Journal Volume: 12; Journal Issue: 1; Related Information: Paper is open access but URL wasn't accepted by the form.","","Medium: ED; Size: Article No. 4280","","","SC0016162","Journal ID: ISSN 2045-2322; DGE 1735087","10.1038/s41598-022-07922-w","","2022-06-07T00:00:00Z","1856781","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/1856781","https://www.osti.gov/servlets/purl/1856781","Scientific Reports","1","12"

An essential issue is to ensure a building energy simulation model can capture the reality and complexity of buildings and their systems in both the static characteristics and dynamic operations. Building energy model calibration is a technique that takes various types of measured performance data (e.g., energy use) and tunes key model parameters to match the simulated results with the actual measurements. This study performed an application and evaluation of an automated pattern-based calibration method on commercial building models that were generated based on characteristics of real buildings. A public building dataset that includes high-level building attributes (e.g., building type, vintage, total floor area, number of stories, zip code) of 111 buildings in San Francisco, California, USA, was used to generate building models in EnergyPlus. Monthly level energy use calibrations were then conducted by comparing building model results against the actual buildings’ monthly electricity and natural gas consumption. The results showed 57 out of 111 buildings were successfully calibrated against actual buildings, while the remaining buildings showed opportunities for future calibration improvements. Enhancements to the pattern-based model calibration method are identified to expand its use for: (1) central heating, ventilation and air conditioning (HVAC) systems with chillers, (2) space heating and hot water heating with electricity sources, (3) mixed-use building types, and (4) partially occupied buildings.","Springer","","National Renewable Energy Lab.

At full scope and matured functionality, IICE allows us to accelerate the development of and better explore industrialized construction approaches such as prefabrication. IICE also enables wider adoption of energy-efficient products and Industry 4.0 construction automation through worker-machine interaction pilots. Industry 4.0 and industrialized construction approaches can encourage workforce specialization in energy efficiency construction, address the lack of multi-skilled workers, and increase workforce productivity with construction automation. However, recent attempts to integrate these concepts with the industry have only been moderately successful. To address this, focusing the pedagogy on using a digital twin, its digital models, and virtual reality could make the experience of continuing education on construction automation more affordable, accessible, scalable, immersive, and safer, and could greatly improve the efficiency and robustness of the building and construction industry. IICE accurately represents the realities of construction uncertainties without having to create full scale physical prototypes of machines. In this paper, we address the following research question: How can a digital twin and its models in virtual reality enhance the learning experience and productivity of energy efficiency construction workers to gain the skills in operating Industry 4.0 components such as construction automation and handling energy-efficient products in industrialized construction factories and on-site?

"Field validation of data-driven BSDF and peak extraction models for light-scattering fabric shades","Wang, Taoning; Lee, Eleanor S.; Ward, Gregory J.; Yu, Tammie","32 ENERGY CONSERVATION, CONSUMPTION, AND UTILIZATION; Bidirectional scattering distribution function; Daylighting; Complex fenestration systems; Fabrics; Textiles; Windows; Building energy efficiency; Discomfort glare","Shading and daylighting systems affect cooling, heating, and lighting energy use by modulating solar radiation through the building façade. Characterizing shading systems holistically and accurately helps designers and engineers evaluate shading systems to achieve energy and non-energy performance goals. These complex fenestration systems can be modeled using Bidirectional Scattering Distribution Functions (BSDF), which map incident radiation to hemispherical distributions of outgoing radiation. Data-driven, tabulated BSDFs are derived from interpolated goniophotometer measured data, then sampled during the raytracing calculation. A peak extraction (PE) algorithm was developed to circumvent limits in BSDF angular resolution, where the specular peak is extracted during simulation by evaluating the BSDF in the through direction and surrounding region. The objective of this study was to validate this measurement and modeling workflow using field monitored data from a full scale testbed with eleven installed fabrics of different weaves, openness factors, and colors and assess the accuracy of the workflow under different adaptation and contrast conditions. Test conditions were limited to clear sky conditions with the sun in the field of view. Results showed that, for tensor tree datasets, vertical illuminance, solar luminance (2.5° apex), and daylight glare probability (DGP) were predicted to within a mean bias error (MBE) error of -456 lx (-12.3%), -3.46e5 (-38.4%), and -0.042 (-7.8%) when full PE occurred. With a binary classification of glare/ no glare, DGP was predicted accurately with a true positive rate of 0.98 and true negative rate of 1.0 using tensor tree data and less accurately with Klems BSDF data, particularly for cases of no glare. The workflow may be of insufficient accuracy to distinguish borderline performance between fabrics using the four-point glare scale, particularly under low adaptation, high contrast daylit conditions. Errors were due to reductions in peak shape and intensity across the BSDF interpolation and data reduction workflow. Future work is needed to better preserve measurement fidelity during interpolation and sampling, which in turn will improve PE performance.","Elsevier","","Lawrence Berkeley National Lab.

Within the past several years, various optimization models and control strategies have been studied to improve buildings’ energy efficiency and reduce operational expenses under the constraints of satisfying occupants’ comfort requirements. However, the majority of these studies consider building electricity demand and thermal load being satisfied by unidirectional electricity flow from the power grid or on-site renewable energy generation to electrical and thermal home appliances. Opportunities for leveraging low-grade heat for electricity have largely been overlooked due to impracticality at small scale. In 2016, a modular pumped hydro storage technology was invented in Oak Ridge National Laboratory, named Ground Level Integrated Diverse Energy Storage (GLIDES). In GLIDES, employing high-efficiency hydraulic machinery instead of gas compressor/turbine, liquid is pumped to compress gas inside high-pressure vessel creating head on ground level. This unique design eliminates the geographical limitation associated with the existing state-of-the-art energy storage technologies. It is easy to be scaled for building level, community level, and grid level applications. By using this novel hydro-pneumatic storage technology, opportunities for leveraging low-grade heat in building can be economical. In this research, the potential of utilizing low-grade thermal energy to augment electricity generation of GLIDES is investigated. Since GLIDES relies on gas expansion in the discharge process and the gas temperature drops during this non-isothermal process, available thermal energy, e.g., from thermal storage, combined cooling, heat and power system (CCHP), can be utilized by GLIDES to counter the cooling effect of the expansion process and elevate the gas temperature and pressure and boost the roundtrip efficiency. Here, several groups of comparison experiments have been conducted, and the experimental results show that a maximum 12.9% cost saving could be achieved with unlimited heat source for GLIDES, and a moderate 3.8% cost improvement can be expected when operated coordinately with CCHP and thermal energy storage in a smart building.","ASME","","Oak Ridge National Lab.

"Reactivity of Iridium Complexes of a Triphosphorus-Pincer Ligand Based on a Secondary Phosphine. Catalytic Alkane Dehydrogenation and the Origin of Extremely High Activity","Gordon, Benjamin M.; Lease, Nicholas; Emge, Thomas J.; Hasanayn, Faraj; Goldman, Alan S.","37 INORGANIC, ORGANIC, PHYSICAL, AND ANALYTICAL CHEMISTRY; 32 ENERGY CONSERVATION, CONSUMPTION, AND UTILIZATION; alkanes; dehydrogenation; olefins; hydrocarbons; catalysis; alkyls; free energy; ligands; organic reactions","The selective functionalization of alkanes and alkyl groups is a major goal of chemical catalysis. Toward this end, a bulky triphosphine with a central secondary phosphino group, bis(2-di-t-butyl-phosphinophenyl)phosphine (<sup>tBu</sup>P<sup>H</sup>PP), has been synthesized. When complexed to iridium, it adopts a meridional (“pincer”) configuration. The secondary phosphino H atom can undergo migration to iridium to give an anionic phosphido-based–pincer (<sup>tBu</sup>PPP) complex. Stoichiometric reactions of the (<sup>tBu</sup>PPP)Ir complexes reflect a distribution of steric bulk around the iridium center in which the coordination site trans to the phosphido group is quite crowded; one coordination site cis to the phosphido is even more crowded; and the remaining site is particularly open. The (<sup>tBu</sup>PPP)Ir precursors are the most active catalysts reported to date for dehydrogenation of n-alkanes, by about 2 orders of magnitude. The electronic properties of the iridium center are similar to that of well-known analogous (<sup>R</sup>PCP)Ir catalysts. Accordingly, DFT calculations predict that (<sup>tBu</sup>PPP)Ir and (<sup>tBu</sup>PCP)Ir are, intrinsically, comparably active for alkane dehydrogenation. While dehydrogenation by (<sup>R</sup>PCP)Ir proceeds through an intermediate trans-(PCP)IrH<sub>2</sub>(alkene), (<sup>tBu</sup>PPP)Ir follows a pathway proceeding via cis-(PPP)IrH<sub>2</sub>(alkene), thereby circumventing unfavorable placement of the alkene at the bulky site trans to phosphorus. (<sup>tBu</sup>PPP)Ir and (<sup>tBu</sup>PCP)Ir, however, have analogous resting states: square planar (pincer)Ir(alkene). Alkene coordination at the crowded trans site is therefore unavoidable in the resting states. Furthermore, the resting state of the (<sup>tBu</sup>PPP)Ir catalyst is destabilized by the architecture of the ligand, and this is largely responsible for its unusually high catalytic activity.","American Chemical Society (ACS)","","Rutgers Univ., Piscataway, NJ (United States)","USDOE Office of Science (SC), Basic Energy Sciences (BES).

Furthermore, while robust and better suited for extrapolation, knowledge-based modeling has limitations as it is time-consuming and requires information about the system that is not always available (e.g., material properties and interfacial behavior between different materials). Data-driven modeling, on the other hand, is easier to implement but often necessitates large datasets that could be difficult to obtain. In this contribution, knowledge-based modeling and data-driven modeling are combined by implementing a few-shot learning (FSL) approach. A knowledge-based model originally developed for a HT-PEMFCs was used to generate simulated data (887,735 points) and used to pretrain a neural network source model tuned via a genetic algorithm-based AutoML. Then, experimental datasets from HT-PEMFCs with different materials and operating conditions (~50 points each) were used to train six target models via FSL.

"Developing occupant archetypes within urban low-income housing: A case study in Mumbai, India","Malik, Jeetika; Bardhan, Ronita; Hong, Tianzhen; Piette, Mary Ann","32 ENERGY CONSERVATION, CONSUMPTION, AND UTILIZATION; occupant archetype; behavior; energy use; thermal comfort; low-income housing","Rapid urbanization pressure and poverty have created a push for affordable housing within the global south. The design of affordable housing can have consequences on the thermal (dis)comfort and behaviour of the occupants, hence requiring an occupant-centric approach to ensure sustainability. This paper investigates occupant behaviour within the urban poor households of Mumbai, India and its impact on their thermal comfort and energy use. This study is a first-of-its-kind attempt to explore the socio-demographic characteristics and energy-related behaviour of low-income occupants within Indian context. Three occupant archetypes, Indifferent Consumers; Considerate Savers; and Conscious Conventionals, were identified from the behavioural and psychographic characteristics gathered through a transverse field survey. A two-step clustering approach was adopted for occupant segmentation that highlighted considerable diversity in occupants’ adaptation measures, energy knowledge, energy habits, and their pro-environmental behaviour within similar socio-economic group. Building energy simulation of the representative archetype behaviour estimated up to 37% variations for air-conditioned and up to 8% variation for fan-assisted naturally ventilated housing units during peak summer months. The results from this study establish the significance of occupant factors in shaping energy demand and thermal comfort within low-income housing and pave way for developing occupant-centric building design strategies to serve this marginalized population. The developed low-income occupant archetypes would be useful for architects and energy modelers to generate realistic energy use profiles and improve building performance simulation results.","Springer","","Lawrence Berkeley National Lab.

However, less than 8% of U.S. residential electric customers are enrolled in DF programs. A major research gap on this topic is an uneven understanding of behavioral drivers of electricity use and DF program participation at the household level. In this study, we employ machine learning models to predict residential occupant behavior in activities relevant to DF. We model occupants' extensive decisions (i.e., choice of action) and intensive behaviors (i.e., amount of time spent) during peak and off-peak time periods using the publicly available American Time Use Survey, which includes activities data for approximately 200,000 respondents. In our machine learning models, predictions for both extensive and intensive behavior fell within a +/-20% error margin at the aggregate level. We identify 13 key sociodemographic predictors of DF-related intensive behavior using LASSO inference and beta coefficient ranking. However, these top predictors differ by activity, suggesting potential scope for differential user targeting for DF events and technologies during program design. This work also contributes to understanding when and who might adopt these DF technologies based on their daily routine activities.","Elsevier","","National Renewable Energy Lab.

"Improved Particle Swarm Algorithm Using Rubik’s Cube Topology for Bilevel Building Energy Transaction","Feng, Xiaochun; Chen, Yang; Zhang, Jian; Cho, Heejin; Shi, Xin","32 ENERGY CONSERVATION, CONSUMPTION, AND UTILIZATION; particle swarm algorithm; cubic topology; bilevel energy transaction; local energy market","Following the rapid growth of distributed energy resources (e.g., renewables, battery), localized peer-to-peer energy transactions are receiving more attention for multiple benefits, such as reducing power loss and stabilizing the main power grid. To promote distributed renewables locally, the local trading price is usually set to be within the external energy purchasing and selling price range. Consequently, building prosumers are motivated to trade energy through a local transaction center. This local energy transaction is modeled in bilevel optimization game. A selfish upper level agent is assumed with the privilege to set the internal energy transaction price with an objective of maximizing its arbitrage profit. Meanwhile, the building prosumers at the lower level will response to this transaction price and make decisions on electricity transaction amount. Therefore, this non-cooperative leader-follower trading game is seeking for equilibrium solutions on the energy transaction amount and prices. Additionally, a uniform local transaction price structure (purchase price equals selling price) is considered here. Aiming at reducing the computational burden from classical Karush–Kuhn–Tucker (KKT) transformation and protecting the private information of each stakeholder (e.g., building), swarm intelligence-based solution approach is employed for upper level agent to generate trading price and coordinate the transactive operations. On one hand, to decrease the chance of premature convergence in global-best topology, Rubik’s Cube topology is proposed in this study based on further improvement of a two-dimensional square lattice model (i.e., one local-best topology-Von Neumann topology). Rotating operation of the cube is introduced to dynamically changing the neighborhood and enhancing information flow at the later searching state. Several groups of experiments are designed to evaluate the performance of proposed Rubik’s Cube topology-based particle swarm algorithm. The results have validated the effectiveness of proposed topology and operators comparing with global-best version PSO and Von Neumann topology-based PSO and its scalability on larger scale applications.","ASME","","Oak Ridge National Lab.

It shifts the resonant frequency away from the operating frequency that affects the power flow and efficiency from the charging station to the load. This work proposes a novel capacitive wireless power transfer (CPT) using an 8-plate multi-resonant capacitive coupling to minimize the effect of misalignments. A single-active switch class-E<sup>2</sup> power converter is utilized to achieve multi-resonance through the selection of different resonant inductors. Simulations show a widening of the resonant frequency band which offers better performance than a regular 4-plate capacitive coupling for misalignments. The hardware results of the 8-plate multi-resonant coupling show an efficiency of 88.5% for the 20.8 W test, which is 18.3% higher than that of the regular 4-plate coupling. Because of the wider resonant frequency band {455–485 kHz}, compared with the regular 4-plate coupling, the proposed design minimized the output voltage drop by 15% for a 10% misalignment. Even for large misalignments, the 8-plate performance improved by 40% compared with the 4-plate coupling.","MDPI","","Old Dominion Univ., Norfolk, VA (United States)","USDOE Office of Science (SC), Fusion Energy Sciences (FES)","","United States","2022-02-18T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: Electronics; Journal Volume: 11; Journal Issue: 4","","Medium: ED; Size: Article No. 635","","","SC0020183","Journal ID: ISSN 2079-9292","10.3390/electronics11040635","","2022-02-25T00:00:00Z","1845903","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/1845903","https://www.osti.gov/servlets/purl/1845903","Electronics","4","11"

"Evaluating cascaded and tunable phase change materials for enhanced thermal energy storage utilization and effectiveness in building envelopes","Kishore, Ravi Anant; Booten, Chuck; Bianchi, Marcus V.A.; Vidal, Judith; Jackson, Roderick","32 ENERGY CONSERVATION, CONSUMPTION, AND UTILIZATION; buildings; cascaded PCMs; load flexibility; thermal storage; tunable PCM","The incorporation of phase change materials (PCMs) in envelope is considered an effective thermal energy storage (TES) method for energy savings and load flexibility in buildings. However, an important limitation of PCMs is their fixed and narrow transition temperature range. Because the interior temperature setpoints are typically different in summer versus winter, and the exterior temperature varies substantially above and below the setpoints during the year, PCMs with a fixed transition temperature are utilized only during part of the year. In this paper, we provide an extensive numerical analysis of the performance of a lightweight building envelope containing three different types of PCMs: traditional single-layer PCM with a fixed transition temperature, novel cascaded two-layer PCM with different transition temperatures, and a ""futuristic"" tunable PCM whose transition temperature can be varied in-situ using external excitation. We compare their performances by evaluating the relationship between the PCM utilization and parameters such as latent heat, transition temperature range, PCM thickness, and PCM location. While traditional PCMs are mostly active during one season, properly designed cascaded and tunable PCMs can be active much longer, thereby allowing load shift and energy savings in both heating and cooling seasons. Under the operating conditions considered in this study, tunable PCMs performed best, providing the highest utilization (about 2 times the traditional PCMs) and enhanced effectiveness (up to 99% peak load reduction in cooling season and 34% peak load reduction in heating season) with the same amount of material as the traditional PCMs; however, cascaded PCMs can be a good alternative while tunable PCMs are unavailable.","Elsevier","","National Renewable Energy Lab.

Although FDD tools can inform operators of building operational faults, currently an action is always required to correct the faults to generate energy savings. Fault auto-correction integrating with commercial FDD technology offerings can close the loop between the passive diagnostics and active control, increase the savings generated by FDD tools, and reduce the reliance on human intervention. This paper presents the field study of seven fault auto-correction algorithms implemented in commercial FDD platforms. Implementation includes software changes in the FDD tools and additional controls hardware or software changes in the BAS that were required to enable the execution of different types of auto-correction algorithms in real buildings. The routines successfully and automatically correct faults and improve the operation of large built-up Heating, Ventilation, and Air Conditioning (HVAC) systems, common in most commercial buildings. The auto-correction algorithms are tested across four buildings and three different building automation systems, following a rigorous procedure to make sure they work properly and do not negatively impact the system and building occupants. Finally, technology benefits, market drivers, and scalability changes are drawn from the implementation effort and test results, to drive future research and industry engagement.","Elsevier","","Lawrence Berkeley National Lab.

Industrial process heating, which still relies heavily on fossil fuel combustion and accounts for the majority of sector wide GHG emissions, is a particularly attractive electrification target. Electrifying industrial boilers represents a cross-cutting opportunity for GHG emissions reductions, given their widespread use in most manufacturing industries. Yet, there are gaps in the understanding of the current population of conventional industrial boilers in the United States that preclude a characterization of boiler electrification's technical potential to reduce fuel consumption and GHG emissions. In this study, we develop an up-to-date dataset of the industrial boiler population in the U.S. and quantify the county-level electricity requirements and net changes in fuel use and GHG emissions under the current electric grid and theoretical future grid scenarios. Our results show an increase of 105 MMmtCO<sub>2</sub>e and 73 MMmtCO<sub>2</sub>e in GHG emissions from boiler electrification, with and without the replacement of byproduct fuels, respectively, under the current electric grid, and a reduction of 19 MMmtCO2e and 7 MMmtCO2e in GHG emissions under a future high renewables electric grid. GHG emissions savings are currently possible only in certain regions of the U.S. unless future grids are decarbonized. We also provide discussion that could be useful for policy makers and manufacturing facilities for advancing the electrification of industrial boilers in locations and industries toward fuel savings and GHG emissions reductions.","Elsevier","","National Renewable Energy Lab.

Plans for their renovation are underway in all European countries, and the process is more complicated for Italian cities due to the lack of space and the large number of historical buildings. This study addresses this challenge by proposing a methodology to renovate a low-income district in the city of Venice using CityBES to model and evaluate energy conservation measures. CityBES is a web-based tool that allows users to employ urban building energy modeling for large-scale energy and retrofit analyses of building stocks. In the case study conducted for Venice's Santa Marta district, due to the particular context, four common energy conservation measures covering both the building envelope and heat generation boilers have been applied. The evaluation of energy-saving performances at the district level showed that the four measures together achieved 67% energy savings, an abatement in energy cost equal to 67%, and annual carbon dioxide emissions reduction of 1.1 MtCO<sub>2</sub>. Furthermore, the case study demonstrates a method and workflow replicable for energy retrofit analysis of building stocks in other historical districts.","Elsevier","","Lawrence Berkeley National Lab.

Building stock energy models (BSEMs) have long been used as a tool to assess the current and future energy demand and environmental impact of building stocks. BSEMs have become more and more complex and are often tailored to case-specific datasets, which results in a high degree of heterogeneity among models. This heterogeneity, together with a lack of consistency in the reporting hinders the understanding of these models and, thereby, an accurate interpretation and comparison of results. In this paper we present a reporting guideline in order to improve reporting practices of BSEMs. The guideline was developed by experts as part of the IEA's Annex 70 and builds upon reporting guidelines from other fields. It consists of five topics (Overview, Model Components, Input and Output, Quality Assurance and Additional Information), which are further subdivided into subtopics. We explain which model aspects should be described in each subtopic, and provide illustrative examples on how to apply the guideline. In closing, the reporting guideline is consistent with the model classification framework and online model registry also developed in the Annex.","Elsevier","","National Renewable Energy Lab.

This paper provides a review of water use in power sector recirculating cooling towers and a baseline assessment of on-site water reuse at natural gas combined cycle (NGCC) power facilities. Two NGCC facilities with reverse-osmosis (RO) or brine-concentrator processes followed by evaporation ponds were selected as case studies; data from these facilities were used to quantify the water, energy, and cost implications of implementing conventional and emerging ZLD technologies. At one case study facility, model results show that implementation of ZLD would reduce water withdrawals by 18%, which is less than savings associated with implementation of dry cooling but comparable to current efforts to reduce water withdrawals by increasing cycles of concentration. Implementation of ZLD using high-recovery RO resulted in a doubling of the levelized cost of water (LCOW). LCOW increased more when a brine concentrator was used. For both case studies, the ZLD system using high-recovery RO required less than 0.1% of a facilitiy's annual electricity generation and the ZLD system using a brine concentrator process required less than 0.8%. Additionally, increasing the evaporation pond area to minimize required ZLD system recovery rates and reduce system electricity costs does not reduce the LCOW. Instead, the LCOW increases because less water is recovered and more water is lost to evaporation. Furthermore, if water availability decreases or water competition/cost increases, facilities may be incentivized to maximize water recovery from ZLD systems.","American Chemical Society (ACS)","","National Renewable Energy Lab.

Conventional wisdom suggests the RFS played a major role in stimulating the ten-fold expansion in ethanol production and consumption in the United States from 2002 to 2019, but evidence increasingly suggests the RFS may have had a smaller effect than previously assumed. Price competitiveness, federal and state policies such as reformulated gasoline requirements, and octane content in ethanol also affect ethanol market attractiveness. This study explores the roles of policy and economic factors by comparing historical data with results from scenarios simulated in a system dynamics model. Results suggest price competitiveness may explain much of the growth in the ethanol industry from 2002 to 2019. The Volumetric Ethanol Excise Tax Credit and phaseout of the oxygenate methyl tert-butyl ether contributed to earlier growth relative to expected timing of growth based on fuel price alone. The RFS (modeled through observed Renewable Identification Numbers) contributed to increased ethanol production in later years and may have increased production in the earlier years if risk of investment was decreased by the RFS Program.","Elsevier","","National Renewable Energy Lab.

This paper evaluates the energy use of a multi-zone VAV system with terminal reheat using the G36 sequences and compares it to a group of baseline control sequences that represent existing practices. Spawn of EnergyPlus is used for the whole building simulation, where the envelope is modelled in EnergyPlus and the HVAC equipment and its pressure-flow network and the control sequences are modelled in Modelica. The comparison of the control sequences performance is further conducted in parametric studies. For a medium-sized commercial building, the G36 sequences provide a wide range of HVAC energy savings with an average of 31%.","Informa UK Limited","","Lawrence Berkeley National Lab.

Something as commonplace as fabric roller shades and venetian blinds may turn daylight prediction into guesswork, and numerous advanced systems on the market tuned specifically to enhance daylight are not sufficiently characterized to distinguish their performance. In this paper, we describe new tools available to handle novel and specialized fabrics, materials, and devices using <em>data-driven</em> modelling of bi-directional scattering distribution functions (BSDFs). These representations are usually tabulated at constant or adjustable angular resolution for efficient point-in-time and annual daylight simulations.

A key factor in the US is to reduce the on-site combustion of fossil fuels for heating end-uses and to replace this with use of electric heat pump technologies connected to a low-carbon grid. The replacement of natural gas furnaces with electric heat pumps is a key home decarbonization strategy. However, the potential for space heating electrification to reduce greenhouse gas emissions depends on the carbon dioxide equivalent (CO<sub>2</sub>e) content of the electricity used by the heat pump. This varies considerably depending on the source of electricity, with large state to state variability. Furthermore, household energy costs are likely to be impacted by the electrification of space heating, because retail energy prices for both natural gas and electricity in each state vary by factors of seven and four, respectively. Contractors, energy programs, government and building code officials, as well as consumers need clear indications of the likely CO<sub>2</sub>e and energy cost impacts of proposed electrification projects, because these will affect decarbonization choices and rationales around scaled heating electrification. Government and utility programs also need to be aware of the likely outcomes of any supported/incentivized measures. Here, in this paper, we investigate these effects by looking at new metrics to analyze the change in CO<sub>2</sub>e emitted and the cost to meet home heating loads when switching from a natural gas furnace to a heat pump for the contiguous 48 states of the mainland US.","Elsevier","","Lawrence Berkeley National Lab.

Despite these important benefits, there are several technological and market barriers impeding the development of DC distribution, which have kept this technology at the demonstration phase. This paper identifies specific end-use cases for which DC distribution in buildings is viable today. We evaluate their technology and market readiness, as well as their efficiency, cost, and resiliency benefits while addressing implementation barriers. The paper starts with a technology review, followed by a comprehensive market assessment, in which we analyze DC distribution field deployments and their end-use characteristics. We also conduct a survey of DC power and building professionals through on-site visits and phone interviews and summarize lessons learned and recommendations. In addition, the paper includes a novel efficiency analysis, in which we quantify energy savings from DC distribution for different end-use categories. Based on our findings, we present specific adoption pathways for DC in buildings that can be implemented today, and for each pathway we identify challenges and offer recommendations for the research and building community.","MDPI","","National Renewable Energy Lab.

The SST features medium-frequency isolation, full controllability for voltage regulation, reactive power compensation, and the capability of battery energy storage system (BESS) integration with multiport configuration. The HT has a partially-rated converter for fractional controllability and can integrate a small BESS. Fast grid-edge voltage fluctuations from increased solar photovoltaic (PV) and electric vehicle (EV) penetration are difficult to manage for mechanical load tap changers. Hence, along with the trend towards more BESS in the grid, the controllability and the storage integration capability of the SST and HT are of strong interest. However, a review of literature shows existing SST and HT research is mostly at converter level, while system-level assessments are scarce. Assessing technical and economic impacts is critical to understanding the benefits and role of the SST and HT to guide future research, which is presented for the first time in this article. Experimental results from medium-voltage (MV) SST and MV HT prototypes are shown to confirm equipment-level feasibility, where the voltage controllability waveforms of a MV HT prototype are reported for the first time. Comparative simulations are performed on a modified IEEE 34-bus system. Here, a grid-model-less decentralized grid-edge voltage control method and a day-ahead BESS dispatch method are proposed for the SST and HT. The simulations show that the SST and HT with integrated storage can host more PV, achieve peak shaving, mitigate voltage fluctuation and reverse power flow, and support energy arbitrage for operational cost reduction, as compared to the LFT. Moreover, comprehensive analyses of net present value (NPV) and internal rate of return (IRR) are performed under different installed PV capacities, HT’s partial converter ratings, and BESS capacities. Sensitivities to future cost reductions of the PV and BESS are studied. Although the NPV and IRR are currently negative, 60% capital cost reduction or 150% revenue increase will make the SST and HT economically viable in the use case studied.","IEEE","","Georgia Institute of Technology, Atlanta, GA (United States)","USDOE Advanced Research Projects Agency - Energy (ARPA-E)","","United States","2022-01-18T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: IEEE Journal of Emerging and Selected Topics in Power Electronics; Journal Volume: 10; Journal Issue: 4","","Medium: ED; Size: p. 3771-3787","","","AR0000899","Journal ID: ISSN 2168-6777","10.1109/jestpe.2022.3144361","","2023-01-18T00:00:00Z","1892475","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/1892475","https://www.osti.gov/servlets/purl/1892475","IEEE Journal of Emerging and Selected Topics in Power Electronics","4","10"
"Building energy efficiency and load flexibility optimization using phase change materials under futuristic grid scenario","Wijesuriya, Sajith; Booten, Chuck; Bianchi, Marcus V. A.; Kishore, Ravi Anant","32 ENERGY CONSERVATION, CONSUMPTION, AND UTILIZATION; building energy; grid-interactive efficient buildings; load flexibility; phase change material; thermal energy storage","This work investigates the energy savings and load flexibility capacity of phase change material (PCM) integrated into building envelope under a future energy generation scenario, where 80% of the energy load comes from renewable sources. Using community-scale modeling, we first determine the net thermal storage required to fully manage the demand variability at a utility grid, and then using whole-building simulations we optimize operating parameters - such as PCM thickness, latent heat, interior setpoint profile, PCM distribution, and heat transfer coefficient - to determine the optimal conditions required for maximum energy reduction and load flexibility without compromising occupants' thermal comfort. The optimal PCM-integrated envelope proposed in this study can provide annual load flexibility up to 33.6% and annual energy savings up to 10.8% in a lightweight residential building located in Baltimore, MD. This study is relevant given the increasing contributions of renewable energy in the total energy generation mix, leading to a significant time-imbalance between peak energy demand and peak energy production. While thermal energy storage using PCM is a recognized technique, there is no known prior study dedicated to examining the thermal performance of PCM-integrated envelope under future energy generation scenarios. This study bridges the research gap by investigating a practical way to implement PCMs in the buildings and maximize the energy efficiency as well as load flexibility related benefits.","Elsevier","","National Renewable Energy Lab.

"Quantifying the effect of multiple load flexibility strategies on commercial building electricity demand and services via surrogate modeling","Luo, Na; Langevin, Jared; Chandra-Putra, Handi; Lee, Sang Hoon","32 ENERGY CONSERVATION, CONSUMPTION, AND UTILIZATION; Commercial building demand response; Surrogate modeling; Bayesian framework; Demand-side management; Grid-interactive efficient buildings","The expansion of commercial building demand response as a demand-side management resource for the electric grid necessitates new decision support resources for customers seeking to assess the benefit–risk tradeoffs of possible strategies for energy flexible building operations. To address this need, we, in this study, develop surrogate models that predict the impacts of several load flexibility strategies on commercial building electricity demand and indoor temperature, focusing on offices and retail buildings at multiple scales. The surrogate models are fit to a synthetic database generated via whole building simulations, which establish the relationships between the key operational features of a given strategy and potential changes in building demand and temperature across a variety of contexts. The surrogate models are translated to a Bayesian framework to allow straightforward communication of uncertainty and parameter updating given new evidence. We find strong predictive performance across the suite of models, underscoring the usefulness of the approach in guiding decisions about implementing load flexibility strategies under a particular set of operational and environmental conditions.","Elsevier","","Lawrence Berkeley National Lab.

It analyses tradeoffs resulting from specific changes to those schedules in terms of three quantities: total electricity consumption per day; maximum hourly electricity consumption per day and predicted percentage dissatisfied (occupant thermal comfort). The method for generating schedules requires a single base schedule as the starting point and, using a few clearly defined parameters, transforms it into a set of schedules that can be used for modelling an existing building stock or for performing parametric studies. Temperature setpoint schedules are generated and simulated for a small office building in a cool-dry climate in three different case studies pertaining to changing temperature setpoint schedules. Tradeoffs between the three output metrics are significant and vary based on the temperature setpoint schedules and the time of the year.","Taylor & Francis","","National Renewable Energy Lab.

Because buildings that consume the smallest amount of energy are easier to electrify, energy efficiency is a crucial step toward fully electrified buildings. Materials advances will play an important role in both reducing the energy intensity of buildings and electrifying their remaining energy use. Materials are currently being explored, discovered, synthesized, evaluated, optimized, and implemented across many building components, including solid-state lighting; dynamic windows and opaque envelopes; cold climate heat pumps; thermal energy storage; heating, ventilating, and air conditioning (HVAC); refrigeration; non-vapor compression HVAC; and more.

"Two-Stage Reinforcement Learning Policy Search for Grid-Interactive Building Control","Zhang, Xiangyu; Chen, Yue; Bernstein, Andrey; Chintala, Rohit; Graf, Peter; Jin, Xin; Biagioni, David","32 ENERGY CONSERVATION, CONSUMPTION, AND UTILIZATION; demand response; reinforcement learning; smart building; zero-order gradient estimation","This paper develops an intelligent grid-interactive building controller, which optimizes building operation during both normal hours and demand response (DR) events. To avoid costly on-demand computation and to adapt to non-linear building models, the controller utilizes reinforcement learning (RL) and makes real-time decisions based on a near-optimal control policy. Learning such a policy typically amounts to solving a hard non-convex optimization problem. We propose to address this problem with a novel global-local policy search method. In the first stage, an RL algorithm based on zero-order gradient estimation is leveraged to search for the optimal policy globally, due to its scalability and the potential to escape some poor performing local optima. The obtained policy is then fine-tuned locally to bring the first-stage solution closer to that of the original unsmoothed problem. Experiments on a simulated five-zone commercial building demonstrate the advantages of the proposed method over existing learning approaches. They also show that the learned control policy outperforms a pragmatic linear model predictive controller (MPC) and approaches the performance of an oracle MPC in testing scenarios. Using a state-of-the-art advanced computing system, we demonstrate that the controller can be learned and deployed within hours of training.","IEEE","","National Renewable Energy Lab.

"Effective properties of semitransparent radiative cooling materials with spectrally variable properties","Kishore, Ravi Anant; Booten, Chuck W.; Wijesuriya, Sajith","32 ENERGY CONSERVATION, CONSUMPTION, AND UTILIZATION; effective properties; participating substrate; radiation cooling; semitransparent coating; spectral variable properties","Radiative cooling is a promising solid-state, non-vapor-compression technology for passive refrigeration and air conditioning. Although this phenomenon occurs naturally, achieving a significant amount of cooling to make it a technically and economically viable technology requires highly engineered, spectrally selective radiative surfaces. These characteristics make radiative cooling difficult to estimate, particularly when it is integrated with other systems such as photovoltaic panels or building envelopes. The complexity further increases when the substrate also participates in the radiative cooling (along with the radiative coating). Energy estimation is becoming increasingly critical because of the recent focus on the semitransparent radiative coatings that transmit a variety of colors to enhance the aesthetic appeal of the system. In this work, we propose an iterative method to calculate the effective radiative properties, which provides the same net radiative cooling that would be observed using the spectral properties at both the coating and substrate surfaces. Compared to traditional methods that rely on either computationally expensive full spectral analysis or methods for averaging each radiative surface parameter locally, our proposed method focuses on calculating effective properties that provide the same the net cooling effect as a full spectral analysis by accounting the emissivity, absorptivity, and transmissivity collectively, thereby providing an overall estimation error of less than 0.2%. We believe that this study will be beneficial to the engineering communities that employ complex simulation codes and require lumped solar and thermal radiation related parameters.","Elsevier","","National Renewable Energy Lab.

In light of the increasing need for sustainable buildings and energy systems, this trend motivates an increasing need for a solution to reduce carbon dioxide emissions and improve energy efficiency. This work proposes a high-performing and transferable occupancy detection framework that combines sensor data from different data modalities, including time series environmental data (temperature, humidity, and illuminance), image data, and acoustic energy data using ensemble method. To draw out the best prediction performance in each modality, the proposed framework was developed, including various models that were designed to learn the occupancy patterns reflected in the physical data streams. To tackle the time series environmental data, we designed two variants of an occupancy detection spatiotemporal pattern network (Occ-STPN) that performs both feature level and decision level fusion, respectively. We also propose a new metric; the fading memory mean square error (FMMSE), that provides a fair evaluation and penalization of delayed occupancy predictions. Multiple open-sourced datasets, including the Electricity Consumption and Occupancy and the University of California, Irvine's (UCI) building occupancy detection dataset, along with our own real data collected from six different houses, were used to validate the algorithms' performance.

To achieve effective OBC, the occupancy status of a space or a building needs to be well understood in terms of whether the space is occupied and how many people are in the space. Well-designed and selected people counting technologies are cornerstones for OBC. However, the study and application of such technologies in OBC are relatively new. There are few mature people counting sensors available on the market. In addition, there is a lack of standardized guidance to comprehensively test, evaluate and compare the performance of people counting sensors, which further limits the selection and application of them in OBC. Hence, an innovative testing protocol was developed to fill in the gap. This paper introduces the design of the protocol with eight diversities and discusses case studies that evaluated four representative types of people counting sensors following the proposed protocol. It is found that the protocol can effectively guide a comprehensive evaluation of the selected sensors and lead to informative findings on the sensor performance. The test results can provide insights and suggestions not only for sensor developers to improve the sensor hardware and software design but also for heating, ventilation, and air-conditioning (HVAC) system designers and building managers to select the proper people counting sensors for OBC design. The test results on the sensor accuracy can also support additional evaluations of integrated OBC and building system operation.","Elsevier","","Pacific Northwest National Lab.

"A first and second law analysis of a thermoresponsive polymer desiccant dehumidification and cooling cycle","Kocher, Jordan D.; Yee, Shannon K.; Wang, Robert Y.","32 ENERGY CONSERVATION, CONSUMPTION, AND UTILIZATION; air conditioning; cooling; dehumidification; desiccant; LCST; thermoresponsive","Herein, we present a theoretical description for a new desiccant air conditioning cycle that uses thermoresponsive polymers instead of traditional desiccants. We use a combined first and second law analysis to demonstrate that this new cycle has three major advantages relative to the traditional case: (i) it can regenerate at lower temperatures, (ii) it can harvest liquid water and (iii) it has significantly higher coefficients of performance (COPs). For example, this new cycle can achieve a COP of 5.1 when regenerated at 95 degrees C, whereas the traditional desiccant cycle is limited to a COP of ~ 1. The fundamental origins of these advantages can be traced to the method of regeneration. The traditional desiccant cycle regenerates by flowing hot air over the desiccant, which provides a medium for gaseous water desorption. However, this also generates entropy and places a minimum temperature constraint on the hot air. In contrast, the thermoresponsive polymer cycle regenerates through a polymer phase transition. The polymer absorbs water vapor in humid air, and then it expels liquid water when raised above its transition temperature. This regeneration method generates liquid water that can be harvested and relaxes constraints on entropy generation and minimum temperature. The minimum regeneration temperature of the thermoresponsive cycle is only limited by the transition temperature of the polymer, which can be tuned through materials science. Due to its liquid water harvesting capability, the new cycle potentially eliminates water consumption when used with evaporative cooling, or it can be directly used for atmospheric water harvesting.","Elsevier","","National Renewable Energy Lab.

"Long-term carbon emission reduction potential of building retrofits with dynamically changing electricity emission factors","Lou, Yingli; Ye, Yunyang; Yang, Yizhi; Zuo, Wangda","32 ENERGY CONSERVATION, CONSUMPTION, AND UTILIZATION; building energy model; building retrofits; carbon emission reduction; electricity emission factors; simulation","Buildings account for approximately 36% of the United States' total carbon emissions and building retrofits have great potential to reduce carbon emissions. Current research adopts a constant electricity emission factor although it changes over time due to the increase of renewable energy generation. Here, to accurately predict emission reduction potential of building retrofits, this study develops a novel method by using dynamically changing electricity emission factors. Using medium office buildings as an example, we predicted emission reduction of eight building retrofit measures from 2020 to 2050 in five locations in the U.S. with distinct climates and renewable adoption rates. To evaluate emission reduction potential sensitivity to the compositions of electricity generation, five scenarios for renewable energy adoptions are investigated. The results reveal several new phenomena on emission reduction potential of building retrofits for medium offices in the U.S.: (1) it decreases from 2026 to 2050; (2) it has the same trend with coal usage; and (3) it reaches the maximum under the high renewable cost scenario. Based on the results, it is recommended that building retrofits should focus on 1) improving lighting and equipment efficiency; 2) locations with higher coal usage rate, and 3) buildings under the high renewable cost scenario. The new method can also be used for predicting emission reduction potential of the building sector in the U.S. by applying to other building types and regions.","Elsevier","","National Renewable Energy Lab.

In this work, commercially available Teflon coated fiberglass and calendered Nomex sampling wipes were modified by mechanically scoring the wipe surface to produce topography that promoted enhanced and localized particle collection. Wipe surface modifications improved particle collection efficiency, relative to unmodified wipes, by factors of 3 to 13 depending on sampling conditions, wipe type, and surface sampled. Improvements were demonstrated for both model polystyrene latex microspheres and inkjet printed explosive particles. The modifications also concentrated particles into pre-defined locations on the wipe which can be engineered to ensure maximum overlap with the thermal desorber of a trace contraband detection system allowing for more effective analysis of collected trace residues.","Royal Society of Chemistry","","National Renewable Energy Lab.

Combustion systems offer large opportunities to enhance energy efficiency through adopting advanced technologies and better-informed operations. The case studies presented illuminate the potential savings and impacts from implementing energy-efficient combustion recommendations and the importance of energy audits and energy efficiency in the fight against climate change. This study describes and quantifies the cascading economic and environmental impacts of implementing the industrial energy efficiency recommendations offered by an energy auditing program by participating facilities over a 10-year period. Results showed that it is expected that a total of $185 M would be saved in energy costs, and 2.3 million metric tons of carbon dioxide emissions would be avoided annually, and about 972 jobs could be created in the studied region if all the combustion recommendations would be implemented. Furthermore, the broader view afforded by the proposed study can be used to support better energy-efficient practices in manufacturing facilities, communities, and states.","ASME","","University of Dayton, OH (United States)","USDOE Office of Energy Efficiency and Renewable Energy (EERE), Energy Efficiency Office.

Recent advances motivated by sustainability have pushed towards augmenting the heat transfer between the tube and the two-phase working fluid. Augmenting heat transfer in two-phase flows enables process intensification, and compactness leading to reduced cost and material consumption. This review investigates the effect of heat transfer enhancement techniques on different fluids including R134a, R407C, R22, etc … The techniques are categorized into passive and active and focus on durable enhancement methods which do not include surface structuring or coating. Passive techniques utilize geometrical and surface modifications to induce better mixing. Several passive techniques are analyzed including fins, inserts, and more. In analyzing these techniques, the effect of changing geometric parameters is studied, and the limitations are highlighted. Further, active techniques that enable heat transfer enhancement through applying power are also investigated. Electrohydrodynamic approaches are analyzed and compared to passive techniques. Additionally, the implications of heat exchange enhancement in the context of global energy are discussed. An energy analysis discretized by the use sector is conducted, with an emphasis on predicting the future potential for renewable and sustainable development. Moreover, although active approaches provide the highest heat transfer enhancement, due to implementation difficulties, passive techniques are more frequently adopted. The review ends with discussion of next-generation heat exchangers which will rely more on additive manufacturing due to its flexibility and reduced cost per part as the technology matures.","Elsevier","","Oak Ridge National Lab.

"Investigation of pre-cooling as a recommended measure to improve residential buildings’ thermal resilience during heat waves","Zeng, Zhaoyun; Zhang, Wanni; Sun, Kaiyu; Wei, Max; Hong, Tianzhen","32 ENERGY CONSERVATION, CONSUMPTION, AND UTILIZATION; Pre-cooling; climate change; thermal resilience; heat wave; district-scale; optimization","More intense heat waves are expected to occur more frequently in the twenty-first century. During severe heat waves, cooling capacity shortfall and overheating are likely to occur in residential buildings, and this will adversely affect occupant's thermal comfort and productivity. We propose a strategy of pre-cooling the house during off-peak hours to mitigate overheating during heat waves. Additionally, simulation results of a prototype single-family house show that adopting the rule-based control (RBC) of pre-cooling thermostat setpoint schedule is effective in reducing thermal discomfort, and that the efficacy of pre-cooling depends upon several building characteristics. An optimized control (OC) of the thermostat setpoint schedule was developed based on the simulation of a prototype building. A simplified yet improved RBC (IRBC) pre-cooling schedule was then extracted from the OC schedule for practical implementation at a larger scale. The effects of the RBC schedule and IRBC schedule were evaluated in the King District of Fresno, which contains 814 residential buildings. Results show that both thermostat setpoint schedules can reduce overheating effectively and that IRBC is slightly better than RBC for most buildings. The findings support the California government's recommendation on pre-cooling to mitigate overheating, which can be further improved with an optimized thermostat setpoint schedule broadcast to residents through early alert messages before a heat wave.","Elsevier","","Lawrence Berkeley National Lab.

Saving energy to heat and cool buildings would contribute substantially to sustainability. Here we propose a category of coloured low-emissivity films for building walls that constitute the main component of the building thermal envelope. We demonstrate high reflectance (~90%) in infrared wavelength range and selective reflectance in the visible light wavelength range for desired colours. These films can help minimize radiative heat exchange between the indoor and outdoor environments, thus saving energy for all-year cooling and heating while satisfying the required aesthetical effect. Simulations show that these films can help reduce heat gain and loss by up to 257.6 MJ per installation wall area annually. In the case of a typical midrise apartment building, the HVAC system can save up to 124.46 GJ (equal to 9.87% of the building’s HVAC energy consumption). By rough estimation, a global CO<sub>2</sub> emission reduction of 1.14 billion metric tons annually could be achieved.

"A rigorous physics-based enhanced parameter estimation (EPE) methodology for calibration of building energy simulations","Subbarao, Kris; Didwania, Srijan K.; Reddy, T. Agami; Addison, Marlin","32 ENERGY CONSERVATION, CONSUMPTION, AND UTILIZATION; Calibration of building energy simulations; Energy efficiency; Optimization and modeling; Smart buildings; Commissioning","Buildings rarely perform as designed/simulated and there are numerous tangible benefits if this gap is reconciled. A new scientifically rigorous yet pragmatic methodology for calibrating building energy simulations - called Enhanced Parameter Estimation (EPE) - is proposed that allows physically relevant parameter estimation rather than a blind force-fit to energy use data. Starting with a rapidly created simulation model, calibration is performed in two stages: (a) building shell calibration with the HVAC system replaced by an ideal system that meets the loads (b) HVAC system calibration with the building shell and all internal loads replaced by a box with only process loads. In the first stage, EPE identifies a small number of high-level heat flows in the energy balance, calculates them with specifically tailored individual driving functions, introduces physically significant parameters to best accomplish energy balance, and, estimates the parameters and their uncertainty bounds. Calibration is thus done with corrective heat flows without any arbitrary tuning of input parameters. Calibration accuracy is enhanced by machine learning of the residual errors. The EPE methodology is demonstrated by means of: a synthetic building and an actual 75,000 sq. ft. building in Pennsylvania. Future work needed for widespread application is discussed.","Taylor & Francis","","Golden Analytics LLC, Falls Church, VA (United States)","USDOE Office of Energy Efficiency and Renewable Energy (EERE), Energy Efficiency Office.

"Standardizing Performance Metrics for Building-Level Electrical Distribution Systems","Nazir, Moazzam; Ghatpande, Omkar; Bernal Heredia, Willy; Wierzbanowski, Cameron; Gerber, Daniel; Saha, Avijit","32 ENERGY CONSERVATION, CONSUMPTION, AND UTILIZATION; AC and DC electrical power distribution; buildings; electrical distribution systems; energy efficiency; metrics; performance metrics; standardization","Building-level electrical distribution systems comprise a myriad of current-carrying equipment, conversion devices, and protection devices that deliver power from the utility or local distributed energy resources to end-use building loads. Electric power has traditionally been generated, transmitted, and distributed in alternating current (AC). However, the last decade has seen a significant increase in the integration of native direct current (DC) equipment that has elevated the importance of DC distribution systems. Numerous studies have comparatively examined the performance of various electrical distribution systems in buildings but have failed to achieve uniform conclusions, primarily because of a lack of consistent and analogous performance evaluation methods. This paper aims to fill this gap by providing a standard set of metrics and measurement boundaries to consistently evaluate the performance of AC, DC, or hybrid AC/DC electrical distribution systems. The efficacy of the proposed approach is evaluated on a representative medium-sized commercial office building model with AC distribution and an equivalent hybrid AC/DC and DC distribution model, wherein the AC distribution model is concluded to be the most efficient. The simulation results show variation in computed metrics with different selected boundaries that verify the effectiveness of the proposed approach in ensuring consistent computation of the performance of building-level electrical distribution systems. This paper provides an initial set of guidelines for building energy system stakeholders to adopt appropriate solutions, thus leading to more efficient energy systems.","MDPI","","National Renewable Energy Lab.

It lacks a formal end-to-end quality control and it has been shown not to deliver high performance sequences at scale. While high-performance HVAC control sequences enable significant reductions in energy consumption, errors in implementing the control logic are common even for less advanced sequences. To improve this situation, we present a digitized building control delivery workflow with formal end-to-end verification, a Control Description Language for the digital specification of building control sequences within this workflow, and software tools that enable digitization of this process. Using the process and tools introduced here, mechanical designers can customize, test and improve these sequences within annual energy simulation, store them in a library for use in other projects, and export them for bidding. Control providers can implement the sequences on existing control product lines through code generation. Commissioning providers can formally verify whether as-installed sequences conform to the digital design specification that was exported by the mechanical designer. Moreover, control product development teams can use the reference implementations of these libraries within their product testing to ensure that their products reproduce the behavior of the reference implementations. This paper presents this process, the language and the supporting software, together with examples of all of the above steps. The presented work has given rise to a new proposed standard, ASHRAE 231P, that will allow digitizing the building control delivery process through the standardization of a control-vendor independent format for exchanging control logic that we pioneered through the here presented work.","Elsevier","","Lawrence Berkeley National Lab.

The experimental data were used to construct a comprehensive magnetic and structural phase diagram as a function of x from below their respective structural transition temperatures to their melting temperatures. The XRD analysis shows that the observed volume reduction is associated with the increasing structural transition temperature.

The fabricated temperature-adaptive radiative coating (TARC) optimally absorbs the solar energy and automatically switches thermal emittance from 0.20 for ambient temperatures lower than 15°C to 0.90 for temperatures above 30°C, driven by a photonically amplified metal-insulator transition. Simulations show that this system outperforms existing roof coatings for energy saving in most climates, especially those with substantial seasonal variations.","AAAS","","Lawrence Berkeley National Lab.

To evaluate embodied GHG emissions of buildings and to provide insights on building materials and building design decisions toward decarbonization, we have recently created a building life-cycle assessment (LCA) module in the widely used Greenhouse gases, Regulated Emissions, and Energy use in Technologies (GREET (R)) LCA model. We applied the GREET building LCA module to examine embodied GHG impacts and the payback period of a LEED (Leadership in Energy and Environmental Design) certified public library in Chicago, USA. We developed localized, detailed life-cycle inventories to address individual building materials used in the library. We expanded the LCA system boundary to include the mechanical, electrical, and plumbing system, as well as refrigerant impacts, which are often ignored in previous studies. Results show that the total embodied GHG emissions are approximately 817 metric tons, or approximately 538 kg/m<sup>2</sup>. Sensitivity analysis highlights the positive role of increasing the use of recycled materials for reducing embodied GHG emissions. Sensitivity analysis on embodied GHG emissions payback periods shows the need to benchmark the embodied and operational carbon performance of buildings for comparison to alternative building designs and sustainability practices. Furthermore, this analysis demonstrates that building LCA models, such as the GREET building LCA module, which addresses embodied and operational GHG emission impacts of whole buildings holistically, could empower building architects, technology developers, manufacturers, and general contractors to address embodied and operational impacts holistically for building sustainability.","Elsevier","","Argonne National Lab.

Due to climate change, population growth, and industrialization, HVAC use is globally on the rise. Unfortunately, these systems often operate in a continuous fashion without regard to actual human presence, leading to unnecessary energy consumption. As a result, the heating, ventilation, and cooling of unoccupied building spaces makes a substantial contribution to the harmful environmental impacts associated with carbon-based electric power generation, which is important to remedy. For our modern electric power system, transitioning to low-carbon renewable energy is facilitated by integration with distributed energy resources. Automatic engagement between the grid and consumers will be necessary to enable a clean yet stable electric grid, when integrating these variable and uncertain renewable energy sources. We present the WHISPER (Wireless Home Identification and Sensing Platform for Energy Reduction) system to address the energy and power demand triggered by human presence in homes. The presented system includes a maintenance-free and privacy-preserving human occupancy detection system wherein a local wireless network of battery-free environmental, acoustic energy, and image sensors are deployed to monitor homes, record empirical data for a range of monitored modalities, and transmit it to a base station. Several machine learning algorithms are implemented at the base station to infer human presence based on the received data, harnessing a hierarchical sensor fusion algorithm. Results from the prototype system demonstrate an accuracy in human presence detection in excess of 95%; ongoing commercialization efforts suggest approximately 99% accuracy. Using machine learning, WHISPER enables various applications based on its binary occupancy prediction, allowing situation-specific controls targeted at both personalized smart home and electric grid modernization opportunities.</p>","MDPI AG","","National Renewable Energy Lab.

Here, this paper differs from prior work and leverages two recent releases of the U.S. National Household Travel Survey (NHTS) data for 2009 and 2017 to develop machine learning (ML) models, specifically gradient boosting machine (GBM), for predicting household-level online shopping purchases. The NHTS data allow for not only conducting nationwide investigation but also at the level of households, which is more appropriate than at the individual level given the connected consumption and shopping needs of members in a household. We follow a systematic procedure for model development including employing Recursive Feature Elimination algorithm to select input variables (features) in order to reduce the risk of model overfitting and increase model explainability. Among several ML models, GBM is found to yield the best prediction accuracy. Extensive post-modeling investigation is conducted in a comparative manner between 2009 and 2017, including quantifying the importance of each input variable in predicting online shopping demand, and characterizing value-dependent relationships between demand and the input variables. In doing so, two latest advances in machine learning techniques, namely Shapley value-based feature importance and Accumulated Local Effects plots, are adopted to overcome inherent drawbacks of the popular techniques in current ML modeling. The modeling and investigation are performed at the national level, with a number of findings obtained. The models developed and insights gained can be used for online shopping-related freight demand generation and may also be considered for evaluating the potential impact of relevant policies on online shopping demand.","Springer","","Argonne National Lab.

Pulegone reductase is the key enzyme in the biosynthesis of menthol and is required for the stereoselective reduction of the Δ<sup>2,8</sup> double bond of pulegone to produce the major intermediate menthone, thus determining the stereochemistry of menthol. However, the structural basis and mechanism underlying the stereoselectivity of pulegone reductase remain poorly understood. In this study, we characterized a novel (-)-pulegone reductase from <jem>Nepeta tenuifolia</em> (<em>Nt</em>PR), which can catalyze (-)-pulegone to (+)-menthone and (-)-isomenthone through our RNA-seq, bioinformatic analysis in combination with <em>in vitro</em> enzyme activity assay, and determined the structure of (+)-pulegone reductase from <emM. piperita</em> (<emc>Mp</em>PR) by using X-ray crystallography, molecular modeling and docking, site-directed mutagenesis, molecular dynamics simulations, and biochemical analysis. We identified and validated the critical residues in the crystal structure of <em>Mp</em>PR involved in the binding of the substrate pulegone. We also further identified that residues Leu56, Val282, and Val284 determine the stereoselectivity of the substrate pulegone, and mainly contributes to the product stereoselectivity. This work not only provides a starting point for the understanding of stereoselectivity of pulegone reductases, but also offers a basis for the engineering of menthone/menthol biosynthetic enzymes to achieve high-titer, industrial-scale production of enantiomerically pure products.","Frontiers Research Foundation","","Washington State Univ., Pullman, WA (United States)","USDOE Office of Science (SC), Basic Energy Sciences (BES).

We leverage household-level interval meter data to apply normalized metered energy consumption (NMEC) methods at significant scale—more than 25,000 electric meters and more than 15,000 gas meters. We develop a comparison group to account for non-project-related changes in usage. The projects include homes that replaced existing HVAC equipment with higher-efficiency units and homes that installed central heating or air conditioning equipment for the first time. We have limited information on pre-project household equipment stock so we develop a method to infer new installations. We find that projects that installed energy efficiency technologies reduce electricity consumption by approximately 3% and gas consumption by approximately 3.5% on average. When we remove homes that installed new cooling and heating equipment for the first time, savings rise to approximately 5% for electricity and approximately 6% for gas. Given the California climate and the results of an existing study of similar California projects, these results are in line with expectations. Solar PV projects produce electricity that offsets approximately 69% of household electricity consumption on average. We estimate that California R-PACE projects installed through the end of 2019 produce annual reductions in grid-tied electricity consumption of 506 GWh (equivalent to the electricity consumption of approximately 74,000 California households) and gas consumption reductions of 2 million therms (equivalent to the gas consumption of approximately 4700 California households) in a typical weather year.","MDPI","","Lawrence Berkeley National Lab.

In this approach, a set of RL agents, with different look ahead periods, were trained using the deep Q-networks (DQN) algorithm and their performance was tested on an unseen pair of price and hot water usage profiles. The testing results showed that the RL agents can help save electricity cost in the range of 19% to 35% compared to the baseline operation without causing any discomfort to end users.

This study focuses on a field study using CTA-2045–enabled water heaters to shift electric load off the peak and toward periods when renewable resources are more prevalent (e.g., near noon for solar resources and near midnight for wind resources). The following load shifting strategies were compared to understand effects on the aggregate load-shifting capabilities of Heat Pump Water Heaters (HPWHs) and on consumer hot water supply: non-targeted (traditional), targeted (grouped, with different shifting schedules) and “smart” (adaptive control commands). The results of this study show that targeted and smart control strategies yield significantly more load-shifting potential from a population of water heaters than the non-targeted approach without sacrificing hot water supply to occupants. However, as control commands become more aggressive, aggregators may face challenges in meeting consumer hot water demand. Furthermore, the findings and lessons learned can benefit electric utilities and inform updates to manufacturer controls and communications standards.

"Investigation of HVAC operation strategies for office buildings during COVID-19 pandemic","Faulkner, Cary A.; Castellini, John E.; Zuo, Wangda; Lorenzetti, David M.; Sohn, Michael D.","32 ENERGY CONSERVATION, CONSUMPTION, AND UTILIZATION; building energy; COVID-19; indoor air quality; Modelica","To minimize the indoor transmission of contaminants, such as the virus that can lead to COVID-19, buildings must provide the best indoor air quality possible. Improving indoor air quality can be achieved through the building's HVAC system to decrease any concentration of indoor contaminants by dilution and/or by source removal. However, doing so has practical downsides on the HVAC operation that are not always quantified in the literature. This paper develops a temporal simulation capability that is used to investigate the indoor virus concentration and operational cost of an HVAC system for two mitigation strategies: (1) supplying 100% outdoor air into the building and (2) using different HVAC filters, including MERV 10, MERV 13, and HEPA filters. These strategies are applied to a hypothetical medium office building consisting of five occupied zones and located in a cold and dry climate. We modeled the building using the Modelica <i>Buildings</i> library and developed new models for HVAC filtration and virus transmission to evaluate COVID-19 scenarios. We show that the ASHRAE-recommended MERV 13 filtration reduces the average virus concentration by about 10% when compared to MERV 10 filtration, with an increase in site energy consumption of about 3%. In contrast, the use of 100% outdoor air reduces the average indoor concentration by about an additional 1% compared to MERV 13 filtration, but significantly increases heating energy consumption. Use of HEPA filtration increases the average indoor concentration and energy consumption compared to MERV 13 filtration due to the high resistance of the HEPA filter.","Elsevier","","National Renewable Energy Lab.

In this article, two challenges in existing insulation coordination designs for grid-connected SSTs are identified. One challenge is the mismatch between metal-oxide varistor (MOV) protective levels and SST insulation strength, the other challenge is the incompatibility of standard impulse test on SST protective structures. To address the MOV selection challenge, a novel lightning protection scheme is designed to protect a single-stage SST where the semiconductor modules are directly exposed to external lightning impulses. Here, the in-lab lightning impulse tests are performed to verify the overvoltage attenuation performance of the prototyped lightning protection scheme. To address the impulse test challenge, the surge withstand capability of the protected SST is comprehensively evaluated with a complete set of insulation coordination design procedures beyond the basic insulation level (BIL) test. After these two challenges are addressed, a discussion is presented on substituting conventional transformers with the protected SSTs into insulation-coordinated distribution systems to facilitate the field deployment of SSTs.","IEEE","","Georgia Institute of Technology, Atlanta, GA (United States)","USDOE Advanced Research Projects Agency - Energy (ARPA-E)","","United States","2021-11-08T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: IEEE Journal of Emerging and Selected Topics in Power Electronics; Journal Volume: 10; Journal Issue: 4","","Medium: ED; Size: p. 3746-3758","","","AR0000899","Journal ID: ISSN 2168-6777","10.1109/jestpe.2021.3125708","","2022-11-08T00:00:00Z","1892478","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/1892478","https://www.osti.gov/servlets/purl/1892478","IEEE Journal of Emerging and Selected Topics in Power Electronics","4","10"

"Efficiency Limits of Evaporative Fabric Drying Methods","Gluesenkamp, Kyle R.; Patel, Viral; Mehdizadeh Momen, Ayyoub","32 ENERGY CONSERVATION, CONSUMPTION, AND UTILIZATION","Cloth drying is a major consumer of energy, and most drying is conducted by evaporative methods. The evaporative drying energy efficiency limit is commonly assumed to be 100%: one unit of latent heat removed per unit of energy expended. However, this ignores the “free drying” available from unsaturated ambient air and the possible role of heat pumping. We demonstrate that efficiency limits for evaporative drying are fundamentally related to both drying rate and ambient psychrometric conditions. A relationship among efficiency, drying rate, and ambient conditions is quantified for several evaporative drying technologies, and a comparison among evaporative technologies is provided. In addition, a comparison is provided between efficiency limits and state of the art device performance. This research will help guide future research in the most promising directions.","Taylor & Francis","","Oak Ridge National Lab.

In this work, a dual phase change diode with a rectification ratio of ~3.5 for an applied temperature bias of ~40 K is presented, which is among the highest-performing junction diodes based on phase change materials at the macroscale for near room temperature applications.

Therefore, this paper presents the Building Optimization Testing Framework (BOPTEST) and associated software for simulation-based benchmarking of building HVAC control algorithms.

Among the large number of thermoelectric (TE) materials, half-Heusler (hH) alloys are leading candidates for medium- to high-temperature power generation applications. However, the fundamental challenge in this field has been inhomogeneous material properties at large wafer diameters, insufficient power output from the modules, and rigid form factors of TE modules. This has restricted the transition of TEGs in practical applications for over three decades. Here, we successfully demonstrate large diameter wafers with uniform TE properties, high-power conformal hH TE modules for high-temperature application, and their direct integration on flue gas platforms, such as cylindrical tubes, to form large area flexible TEGs. This new conformal architecture design provides a breakthrough toward medium-/high-temperature TEGs over the conventional BiTe- and polymer-based flexible TEG design. In this work, a variable fill factor and greater flexibility due to the conformal design result in higher device performance as compared to conventional rigid TEG devices. Modules with 72-couple hH legs exhibit a device high-power-density of 3.13 W cm-2 and a total output power of 56.6 W under a temperature difference of 570 degrees C. These results provide a promising pathway toward widespread utilization of thermoelectric technology into the waste heat recovery application and will have a significant impact on the development of practical thermal to electrical converters.","American Chemical Society (ACS)","","National Renewable Energy Lab.

It is necessary for building operators to be able to estimate and compare the relative impacts of different mitigation strategies to determine suitable strategies for a particular situation. Using a validated CFD model, this study simulates the dispersion of exhaled contaminants in a thermally stratified conference room with overhead heating. The impacts of portable air-cleaners (PACs) on the room airflow and contaminant distribution were evaluated for different PAC locations and flow rates, as well as for different room setups (socially distanced or fully occupied). To obtain a holistic view of a strategy's impacts under different release scenarios, we simultaneously model the steady-state distribution of aerosolized virus contaminants from eight distinct sources in 18 cases for a total of 144 release scenarios. The simulations show that the location of the source, the PAC settings, and the room set-up can impact the average exposure and PAC effectiveness. For this studied case, the PACs reduced the room average exposure by 31%-66% relative to the baseline case. Some occupant locations were shown to have a higher-than-average exposure, particularly those seated near the airflow outlet, and occupants closest to sources tended to see the highest exposure from said source. We found that these PACs were effective at reducing the stratification caused by overhead heating, and also identified at least one sub-optimal location for placing a PAC in this space.","Elsevier","","National Renewable Energy Lab.

By integrating heat conductive pathways and water transport channels decently, i-Cool exhibits enhanced evaporation ability and high sweat evaporative cooling efficiency, not merely liquid sweat wicking function. In the steady-state evaporation test, compared to cotton, up to over 100% reduction in water mass gain ratio, and 3 times higher skin power density increment for every unit of sweat evaporation are demonstrated. Besides, i-Cool shows about 3 °C cooling effect with greatly reduced sweat consumption than cotton in the artificial sweating skin test. The practical application feasibility of i-Cool design principles is well validated based on commercial fabrics. Owing to its exceptional personal perspiration management performance, we expect the i-Cool concept can provide promising design guidelines for next-generation perspiration management textiles.","Nature Publishing Group","","SLAC National Accelerator Lab., Menlo Park, CA (United States); Lawrence Berkeley National Lab.

To obtain a subambient cooling effect during the daytime, chemically engineered structural materials are widely explored to simultaneously reject sunlight and preserve strong thermal emission. However, many previously reported fabrication processes involve hazardous chemicals, which can hinder a material’s ability to be mass produced. In order to eliminate the hazardous chemicals used in the fabrication of previous works, this article reports a white polydimethylsiloxane (PDMS) sponge fabricated by a sustainable process using microsugar templates. By substituting the chemicals for sugar, the manufacturing procedure produces zero toxic waste and can also be endlessly recycled via methods widely used in the sugar industry. The obtained porous PDMS exhibits strong visible scattering and thermal emission, resulting in an efficient temperature reduction of 4.6 °C and cooling power of 43 W m<sup>–2</sup> under direct solar irradiation. In addition, due to the air-filled voids within the PDMS sponge, its thermal conductivity remains low at 0.06 W (m K)<sup>–1</sup>. This unique combination of radiative cooling and thermal insulation properties can efficiently suppress the heat exchange with the solar-heated rooftop or the environment, representing a promising future for new energy-efficient building envelope material.","Wiley","","State Univ. of New York at Buffalo, NY (United States)","USDOE Office of Science (SC); National Science Foundation (NSF)","","United States","2021-10-20T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: Advanced Science; Journal Volume: 8; Journal Issue: 23","","Medium: ED; Size: Article No. 2102502","","","FE0031960; CBET-1932968","Journal ID: ISSN 2198-3844; CBET‐1932968","10.1002/advs.202102502","","2022-12-07T00:00:00Z","1831812","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/1831812","https://www.osti.gov/servlets/purl/1831812","Advanced Science","23","8"
"Evaluation of hybrid evaporative-vapor compression air conditioners for different global climates","Jacob, Tabeel A.; Shah, Nihar; Park, Won Young","32 ENERGY CONSERVATION, CONSUMPTION, AND UTILIZATION; evaporative cooling; air-conditioning; climate assessment; energy efficiency; cooling efficiency","Currently, a majority of global residential air-conditioning requirements are met using cooling systems based on the vapor compression cycle (VCC). To meet the future demand for space cooling and to reduce the corresponding environmental impact, there is a need for alternative cooling systems which require less resources and exhibit a higher coefficient of performance (COP). One of proposed alternatives is called the hybrid evaporative-vapor compression (HEVC) cycle, which utilizes adiabatic latent cooling in combination with the VCC. In this paper, we conducted a feasibility analysis of a HEVC system by comparing its performance to that of VCC for various global climates. To accomplish this, we developed and validated models to simulate the performance of residential VCC and HEVC systems. ASHRAE weather data and design conditions were then used to compare the performance of the two systems. In general, HEVC systems are best suited for hot arid climates with energy reduction greater than 20%. Conversely, humid climates are not suitable for HEVC adoption due to degraded performance of evaporative coolers in these climates. In addition to comparing the energy savings from HEVC systems, it is also critical to analyze their water consumption. Generally, climates that benefit the most from HEVC technology tend to also experience water scarcity issues. Thus, both the energy savings and water consumption of HEVC systems must be analyzed to guide the discussion on their adoption.","Elsevier","","Lawrence Berkeley National Lab.

"Shock tube investigation of high-temperature, extremely-rich oxidation of several co-optima biofuels for spark-ignition engines","Rahman, Ramees K.; Barak, Samuel; Wagnon, Scott W.; Kukkadapu, Goutham; Pitz, William J.; Vasu, Subith S.","32 ENERGY CONSERVATION, CONSUMPTION, AND UTILIZATION; 37 INORGANIC, ORGANIC, PHYSICAL, AND ANALYTICAL CHEMISTRY; Biofuel; shock tube; species histories; reaction mechanism; diisobutylene; ethanol; cyclopentanone; methyl acetate; methylfuran; co-optima","To reduce the reliance on fossil fuels in the transportation sector and increase combustion efficiency, the Co-Optima initiative from US Department of Energy identified the top 10 biofuels for downsized, boosted, spark-ignition engines. Most of these biofuels have detailed reaction mechanisms available in literature developed based on studies at temperatures lower than 1700 K and an equivalence ratio of less than five. As such, the performance of these detailed mechanisms at high temperature and extremely rich conditions are unknown. It is important to validate kinetic mechanisms at these conditions because they are conducive to soot formation. Prediction of soot by chemical kinetic models relies on the prediction of underlying benchmark species like carbon monoxide and ethylene. In this work, we conduct high temperature (1700–2050 K) and high equivalence ratio(Φ=8.6) oxidation of these biofuels, namely 2,4,4-trimethyl-1-pentene (α-diisobutylene), ethanol, cyclopentanone, methyl acetate, and 2-methylfuran, blended in ethylene behind reflected shock waves at 4–4.7 atm pressure. Carbon monoxide and ethylene time histories are measured simultaneously using a continuous feedback quantum cascade laser near 4.9 µm and a tunable CO<sub>2</sub> gas laser at 10.532 nm, respectively. Results show that ethanol blend forms more carbon monoxide than other biofuels and consumes ethylene faster than the biofuel blends in the temperature range considered. Overall, the performance of different mechanisms in literature are evaluated against the experimental results. The novel reaction mechanism ‘the Co-Optima model’, which includes the sub mechanisms for all the biofuels in this study, was found to be the best mechanism for the experimental conditions studied.","Elsevier","External Audience (Unlimited)","Lawrence Livermore National Lab.

"Addressing energy storage needs at lower cost <i>via</i> on-site thermal energy storage in buildings","Odukomaiya, Adewale; Woods, Jason; James, Nelson; Kaur, Sumanjeet; Gluesenkamp, Kyle R.; Kumar, Navin; Mumme, Sven; Jackson, Roderick; Prasher, Ravi","32 ENERGY CONSERVATION, CONSUMPTION, AND UTILIZATION; 25 ENERGY STORAGE; buildings; levelized cost of storage; TES research directions; thermal energy storage","Cost-effective energy storage is a critical enabler for the large-scale deployment of renewable electricity. Significant resources have been directed toward developing cost-effective energy storage, with research and development efforts dominated by work on lithium ion (Li-ion) battery technology. Though Li-ion batteries have many attractive qualities, it is not clear whether they can provide an affordable levelized cost of storage (LCOS) for certain applications, such as buildings. Buildings consume most of the world's electricity, and as much as 50% of their consumption goes toward meeting thermal loads. Thermal energy storage (TES) can provide a cost-effective alternative to Li-ion batteries for buildings; however, two questions remain to be answered. First, how much of total building energy storage requirements can be met via thermal storage for building loads? Second, can the LCOS for TES be favorable compared with Li-ion batteries? In this perspective, using the United States as a case study, we show that the total requirement for TES in buildings is in the range of ~1200-4500 electrical GW h, depending on the fraction of solar versus wind in the generation mix. Furthermore, we show that with at least 25% wind generation, all of the storage needed by buildings to support the grid can be met by TES. We also introduce a framework to calculate LCOS for on-site TES in buildings to enable a direct comparison with electrical storage technologies such as Li-ion batteries. This is not trivial, because the input energy type for TES (electricity) differs from the output energy type (thermal energy), and the efficiency can depend on ambient conditions. Our LCOS analysis shows that in many situations, TES can be more cost-effective for buildings than Li-ion batteries. We conclude our perspective by discussing future research and development opportunities that can significantly advance the deployment of TES for buildings to help enable a renewable electricity-dependent grid.","Royal Society of Chemistry (RSC)","","National Renewable Energy Lab.

The study investigated small WWTPs, many of which are serving slow growing or declining populations. Life Cycle Assessment methodology was used to evaluate and compare the inventory and environmental impacts of nine small WWTP case studies. Detailed inventory data was collected from the facilities’ engineering design plans and utility bills. One recommended practice was to avoid significant overdesign by planning for no lower than a 75% capacity utilization by the facilities’ end-of-life. A theoretical correction to a 75% capacity utilization was estimated to mitigate 0.4% of lifetime electricity usage and 1% of secondary process concrete for every 1% reduction in design average flow rate. Relatedly, a 0.4% mitigation in the Carcinogenic and Global Warming impacts could be achieved for every 1% reduction in design average flow toward a 75% capacity utilization. Other suggested practices were focused on conveyance, namely, to minimize non-process facility area and to use polyvinyl chloride pipe instead of ductile iron pipe where possible. Furthermore, the latter practice was estimated to mitigate between 1.1 and 4.8% of the Carcinogenic impact in the nine case studies.","Elsevier","","Univ. of Nebraska, Lincoln, NE (United States)","USDOE Office of Energy Efficiency and Renewable Energy (EERE), Energy Efficiency Office.

"Near and long-term perspectives on strategies to decarbonize China's heavy-duty trucks through 2050","Khanna, Nina; Lu, Hongyou; Fridley, David; Zhou, Nan","32 ENERGY CONSERVATION, CONSUMPTION, AND UTILIZATION","China needs to drastically reduce carbon dioxide (CO<sub>2</sub>) emissions from heavy-duty trucks (HDTs), a key emitter in the growing transport sector, in order to address energy security concerns and meet its climate targets. We address existing research gaps by modeling feasibility, applicability, and energy and emissions impacts of multiple decarbonization strategies at different points in time. China still relies heavily on coal power, so impacts of new HDT technologies depend on the timing of their introduction relative to progress toward non-fossil power. We use a bottom-up model to simulate HDT energy consumption and CO<sub>2</sub> emissions through 2050. Results show that beginning to deploy battery electric and fuel-cell HDTs as early as 2020 and 2035, respectively, could achieve significant and the largest CO<sub>2</sub> emissions reduction by 2050 with a decarbonized power sector. However, viable near-term strategies-improving efficiency and logistics, switching to liquefied natural gas-could halve HDTs' current diesel consumption and CO<sub>2</sub> emissions by 2050. Our results underscore the need for a mix of near- and long-term policy and technology options to decarbonize China's HDTs.","Nature Publishing Group","","Lawrence Berkeley National Lab.

Here, retrofit analysis of dry cooling is conducted on a unit-by-unit basis for both coal-fired and gas-fired power plants in several western U.S. states. Based on regional averages, retrofitting dry cooling systems in lieu of wet cooling towers decreases total annual plant water consumption at existing coal- and gas-fired power plants by 93% and 100%, respectively, while increasing the levelized cost of electricity generation by approximately 12% and 18%, respectively. Over the year, the change in monthly net regional generating capacity from dry cooling retrofits exhibits a seasonal pattern, with the largest shortfalls occurring in July. Dry cooling retrofits thus lead to tradeoffs in water savings, cost, and capacity shortfalls, which vary with power plant characteristics. The tradeoffs identified here can inform electric power industry water management plans and decision-making for alternative cooling options in water-stressed regions.","Elsevier","","National Energy Technology Laboratory (NETL), Pittsburgh, PA, Morgantown, WV, and Albany, OR (United States)","USDOE Office of Fossil Energy (FE)","","United States","2021-10-12T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: Applied Energy; Journal Volume: 306","","Medium: ED; Size: Article No. 117997","","","FE0025912","Journal ID: ISSN 0306-2619","10.1016/j.apenergy.2021.117997","","2022-10-12T00:00:00Z","1882420","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/1882420","https://www.osti.gov/servlets/purl/1882420","Applied Energy","","306"

Furthermore, renewable fuels from biomass have always made important contributions as fuel sources. Current trends show that renewable fuels are gaining an even more important role as fuel sources, and chemical kinetic modeling of those fuels is playing an essential role in these advances. Interactions between fuels research and chemical kinetic modeling are discussed in this paper, with emphasis on the close and continuous coupling between them. In many cases, new fuels from biomass have structural or compositional features never before seen in real fuels, so entirely new reaction mechanisms are required.","American Chemical Society (ACS)","External Audience (Unlimited)","Lawrence Livermore National Lab.

"A physics-based model for frost buildup under turbulent flow using direct numerical simulations","Zgheib, N.; Farzaneh, M.; Balachandar, S.; Sherif, S. A.","32 ENERGY CONSERVATION, CONSUMPTION, AND UTILIZATION; Frost; Freezers; Heat transfer; Mass transfer; Ice; Moist air; Frost buildup; Turbulent flow; Direct numerical simulations; Immersed boundary method","We present a new model for frost buildup under turbulent (and laminar) flow using direct numerical simulations. The physical model consists of two layers, the air and the frost. The air layer is fully resolved and consists of solving for the velocity, temperature, and vapor mass fraction fields. The frost layer thickness is resolved using conservation of mass and energy. Both phases are dynamically coupled using the immersed boundary method. Three-dimensional simulations are conducted in an open-channel configuration. A number of challenges need to be overcome to make these simulations feasible. First, to enforce far-field conditions of zero gradient and prescribed mean temperature and humidity, a source term is added to the energy and transport equations in the flow solver. Second, the mean frost thickness is subtracted after each time step to ensure a constant mean flow thickness and level of turbulence in the numerical domain. Third, a slow-time acceleration approach, which accelerates the frost buildup by a predetermined factor, is employed to bridge the gap between the fast turbulent and slow frost buildup time scales. Finally, a frost densification scheme is used to overcome the difficulties of vertically varying frost properties. The model is validated by comparing the frost thickness and frost thickness buildup rate over a period of one hour from a cooled flat plate experiment. As a result, both quantities compare favorably with experiments.","Elsevier","","Univ. of Florida, Gainesville, FL (United States)","USDOE","","United States","2021-09-25T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: International Journal of Heat and Mass Transfer; Journal Volume: 182; Related Information: Zgheib, N., Farzaneh, M., Balachandar, S., and Sherif, S.A., “A Physics-Based Model for Frost Buildup under Turbulent Flow using Direct Numerical Simulations,” International Journal of Heat and Mass Transfer, Vol. 182, January 2022, pp. 121915 (published online September 25, 2021), https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ijheatmasstransfer.2021.121915","","Medium: ED; Size: Article No. 121915","","","EE0007707","Journal ID: ISSN 0017-9310","10.1016/j.ijheatmasstransfer.2021.121915","","2022-09-26T00:00:00Z","1874223","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/1874223","https://www.osti.gov/servlets/purl/1874223","International Journal of Heat and Mass Transfer","","182"

"Modeling Environment for Testing a Distributed Energy Resource Management System (DERMS) Using GridAPPS-D Platform","Poudel, Shiva; Keene, Sean J.; Kini, Roshan L.; Hanif, Sarmad; Bass, Robert B.; Kolln, Jaime T.","32 ENERGY CONSERVATION, CONSUMPTION, AND UTILIZATION; common information model; distributed energy resources; grid services; power system simulation","The electric power system is currently undergoing a major transition due to growing numbers of distributed energy resources (DERs) and increased distribution automation. If optimally managed and operated, DERs could provide flexibility and highly valuable grid services such as restoration, peak shaving, voltage regulation, and frequency support to maintain grid reliability. Different applications and enterprises, such as distributed energy resources management systems (DERMS), are being developed for coordinated and optimal operation of DERs. However, to attract sufficient DER participation and achieve the coordinated operation of DERs, systems and components must be interoperable and information exchange must be secure. Along this line, the Portland State University power engineering group is developing Energy Grid of Things (EGoT) DERMS prototype. The proposed application requires the coordinated dispatch of large numbers of DERs and testing such a system presents a challenge; it is not practical to test system prototypes using thousands of real DERs. Hence, the modeling environment (ME) is designed as a co-simulation tool to model interactions between a DERMS and a mass of simulated DERs. The ME is expected to address the scalability issue inherent to hardware-in-the-loop DERMS simulation; many assets are needed to observe effects on the grid from deployment and dispatch of DERs. To enable the development and testing of such advanced applications for power distribution system planning and operations, the U.S Department of Energy developed GridAPPS-DTM, an open-source, standards-based platform at Pacific Northwest National Laboratory. This paper introduces the proposed ME for testing a DERMS application. The architecture of the ME is presented, and the GridAPPS-D features for a such simulation environment are discussed.

"An Innovative Circuit Breaker for Renewable Power Grids","Schmalz, Steven","32 ENERGY CONSERVATION, CONSUMPTION, AND UTILIZATION; Power grids, circuit breakers, renewable energy, battery storage plants","A key step towards a carbon-neutral future could be reached through dispersed power grids, featuring networks of local-scale renewable energy and battery storage plants. To prevent these power grids from damaging themselves and their surroundings when electrical faults arise, they must be integrated with ‘circuit breakers’, which temporarily interrupt the current flowing through them. However, currently available circuit breakers cannot handle the medium-voltage direct currents best suited for these grids. Through an innovative new circuit breaker design, Steve Schmalz and his colleagues at Eaton Corporation, the Illinois Institute of Technology (IIT), Virginia Tech and the National Energy Technology Laboratory (NETL), hope that this challenge will soon be overcome.","","","Eaton Corporation, Dublin (Ireland)","USDOE Advanced Research Projects Agency - Energy (ARPA-E)","","United States","2022-01-01T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: Scientia.global","","Medium: ED","","","AR0001111","","","","2023-01-02T00:00:00Z","1890167","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/1890167","https://www.osti.gov/servlets/purl/1890167","Scientia.global","",""
"Home Energy Management System for Price-Responsive Operation of Consumer Technologies Under an Export Rate","Munankarmi, Prateek; Wu, Hongyu; Pratt, Annabelle; Lunacek, Monte; Balamurugan, Sivasathya Pradha; Spitsen, Paul","32 ENERGY CONSERVATION, CONSUMPTION, AND UTILIZATION; behind-the-meter resources; co-simulation; dynamic tariff; export rate; home energy management system; home appliances; renewable energy sources; distributed power generation","Dynamic tariffs such as time-of-use (TOU) were introduced to motivate consumers to change the operation of their behind-the-meter (BTM) resources to reduce their power consumption during peak demand times. Recently, export rates have been implemented that reimburse consumers for electricity exported to the grid at a rate less than the retail rate to reduce reverse power flow in distribution power systems with high photovoltaic penetrations. Export rates are expected to be employed more widely, and therefore it is important to understand their impact on consumers, the operation of BTM resources, and the distribution grid. This paper presents a home energy management system (HEMS) capable of optimally scheduling BTM resources under a tariff with export rates. The proposed HEMS is formulated as a multi-objective model predictive control problem. In the paper, we analyze the performance of the proposed HEMS under an export rate including the operation of each BTM resource and the impact on the cost and comfort of homeowners. We also compare the performance of the proposed HEMS under an export rate with the HEMS under a TOU rate. Simulation results are presented for a small power system with several homes that employ the proposed HEMS to respond to an export rate. The simulation results show that the estimated energy cost savings for houses with HEMS and energy storage under an export rate is 20% compared to the baseline scenario with no HEMS. The results also demonstrate that the proposed HEMS responding to an export rate increases the self-consumption of buildings more than HEMS responding to a TOU rate.","Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers","","National Renewable Energy Lab.

"240$^\circ$-Clamped PWM Applied to Transformerless Grid Connected PV Converters With Reduced Common Mode Voltage and Superior Performance Metrics","Qamar, Haleema; Qamar, Hafsa; Korada, Nikhil; Ayyanar, Rajapandian","14 SOLAR ENERGY; 24 POWER TRANSMISSION AND DISTRIBUTION; 32 ENERGY CONSERVATION, CONSUMPTION, AND UTILIZATION; 240° clamped PWM (240CPWM); common mode voltage (CMV); leakage current; photovoltaic (PV); pulse width modulation (PWM); voltage source inverter (VSI); switching loss","Transformerless voltage source inverters (VSIs) are one of the popular topologies for photovoltaic (PV) grid-connected applications due to the lowest component count and simple design. Because of the absence of galvanic isolation in such systems, problem of electromagnetic interference (EMI) due to high leakage current is highly pronounced. Recently various reduced common mode voltage (CMV) PWM (RCMV-PWM) methods which address these issues of CMV, and leakage current have been proposed. These schemes typically function at the expense of increased total harmonic distortion (THD), higher switching loss, high DC link current stress along with limited modulation index range. In this work, 240 ° clamped PWM (240CPWM) is selected as an ideal candidate for grid connected VSIs in terms of all round performance of switching loss, THD, DC link current stress, CMV and leakage current. 240CPWM is a relatively new space vector based PWM method which can attain much superior performance by avoiding the zero states. After a brief overview of the 240CPWM concept, the paper provides a detailed comparison of 240CPWM with conventional space vector PWM (CSVPWM) and discontinuous PWM (DPWM1) methods in terms of each of the above metrics. A 3-phase 208 V 3 kW silicon IGBT based hardware prototype is built to validate the performance of 240CPWM and compared with other popular schemes under grid-connected mode. Experimental results show a 66.7% reduction in the peak CMV and 50% reduction in leakage current with the proposed scheme as compared to CSVPWM. Also, THD, DC link current stress and inverter switching loss are greatly reduced as an added advantage using the proposed method. A new, combined performance index is proposed to compare the performance of different PWM schemes, and it is shown that the 240CPWM achieves the best value for this index among the PWM methods studied.","Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers","","Arizona State Univ., Tempe, AZ (United States)","USDOE Office of Energy Efficiency and Renewable Energy (EERE), Renewable Power Office.

The first step is to select the weighting functions that bound the transfer functions for the entire range of uncertainty. The second step is to form mathematical representation for both robust stability and robust performance. The third step is to conduct the robust H-infinity controller synthesis to generate the full-order controller, and then carry out order reduction and recheck of the design objectives. The last step is to select an optimized controller based on the multi-dimensional Pareto Front algorithm. The proposed method has been firstly applied to the current controller design of a grid-connected inverter with variable grid impedance, and secondly to the voltage controller design of an LLC resonant DC/DC converter with variable resonant capacitance. The results indicate that the selected optimal H-infinity controller has an overall more satisfactory performance in terms of stability, steady-state error, disturbance/noise rejection capability and dynamic performance, compared with conventional PI and PR controllers when there is a large variation of system parameters.","Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers","","Arizona State Univ., Tempe, AZ (United States)","USDOE Office of Energy Efficiency and Renewable Energy (EERE), Renewable Power Office.

"Influence of the concentration ratio on the thermal and economic performance of parabolic trough collectors","Osorio, Julian D.; Rivera-Alvarez, Alejandro","32 ENERGY CONSERVATION, CONSUMPTION, AND UTILIZATION; concentration ratio; double glass envelope; economic performance; efficiency; parabolic trough collectors","The thermal and economic performance of parabolic trough collectors (PTCs) and PTCs with double glass envelope (DGE-PTCs) are analyzed in this work. A model including thermal and optical effects is developed to evaluate the efficiency of vacuum and air-filled DGE-PTCs, while an economic model based on two commercial PTCs (SkyTrough and Ultimate Trough collectors) was developed to assess the economic performance. The efficiency and thermal output per unit cost of the proposed DGE-PTCs are analyzed as a function of the concentration ratio and are respectively compared with the thermal and economic performance of traditional and commercial PTCs. The optimum concentration ratio for maximum thermal performance varies from 11.0 to 23.3 for operation temperatures (T<sub>HTF</sub>) between 100 degrees C and 400 degrees C, while the optimum concentration ratio for maximum economic performance ranges between 28.9 and 33.2 for the SkyTrough and between 40.0 and 43.8 for the Ultimate Trough collector designs. Finally, the DGE-PTCs present higher thermal and economic performance at high operating temperatures, which presents a valuable opportunity for implementation in new PTC designs pursuing higher operating temperatures to achieve superior thermal cycle efficiencies.","Elsevier","","National Renewable Energy Lab.

However, few studies have focused explicitly on high-quality devices grown over patterned substrates, which is required for any cost saving to be beneficial. In this work, we demonstrate the growth of high-efficiency GaAs solar cells on GaAs substrates patterned with an array of nanoscale SiOX mask stripes. We show that reducing the pattern dimensions to submicron length scales with nanoimprint lithography enables defect-free coalescence. By varying the growth conditions, faceting of the epilayer material during overgrowth of the patterned mask was also controlled. A V/III ratio of 200 during MOVPE overgrowth produced smooth coalesced epilayers, which is desirable for the growth of subsequent device layers. Inverted GaAs front homojunction devices grown on patterned GaAs(001) substrates achieved threading dislocation densities below 5 × 10<sup>5</sup> cm<sup>–2</sup> and maintained >23% solar cell efficiencies at one sun illumination, equivalent to control devices grown on unpatterned epi-ready substrates.","American Chemical Society","","National Renewable Energy Lab.

The impact of insulation installation is considered a key factor in improving the strategy of reducing energy consumption. Improved installation practices can affect the airtightness of common wall assemblies to reduce the building energy performance gaps and provide insight on how to allocate resources better. A framework was developed to analyze operational costs and building energy performance to address how installation quality is a factor in the return of investment in building construction for heating and cooling systems within the thermal envelope. With this methodology, aggressive energy performance goals will be met while balancing the tradeoff between installation techniques and building systems efficiency based on the introduced probabilistic investment return (PIR) metric.","American Society of Civil Engineers","","Oak Ridge National Lab.

Gap 1: data bias is common in building operation data, but this topic is hardly studied in DBEM; Gap 2: high data dimensionality is common in DBEM, but a systematic and scalable methodology is lacking to solve the problem; Gap 3: the interactions between data bias and high dimensionality have not been systematically studied for DBEM and predictive control in buildings. In this work, to address the three gaps mentioned above, we develop a framework that integrates active learning and feature selection for DBEM used for whole building data predictive control (or DPC, which is a branch of model predictive control). The framework provides a systematic methodology and automatic workflow that starts with raw data from building automation systems to the establishment of data-driven energy models for DPC controllers. The developed strategies and framework are evaluated in a virtual testbed based on EnergyPlus and BCVTB. Improved performance and reduced computational complexity are observed from the DBEM built with the developed framework, as well as the DPC controller based on that DBEM, indicating the effectiveness of the developed framework.","Elsevier","","National Renewable Energy Lab.

To this end, scale-bridging models (SBMs) approximate the scheduling-relevant dynamics of a process and its controller in a low-order representation. In contrast to previous works that have employed nonlinear SBMs, this paper proposes linear SBMs, developed using time-series analysis, to facilitate online scheduling computations. Using a year-long industrial dataset, we nd that compact linear SBMs are suitable approximations over typical scheduling horizons, but that their accuracies are unpredictable over time. We introduce a strategy for online updating of the SBMs, based on Kalman ltering schemes for online parameter estimation. The approach greatly improves the accuracy of SBM predictions and will enable the use of linear SBM-based demand-response scheduling in the future.","Elsevier","","Univ. of California, Los Angeles, CA (United States)","USDOE Office of Energy Efficiency and Renewable Energy (EERE); National Science Foundation (NSF); CESMII Project","","United States","2021-09-08T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: IFAC-PapersOnLine; Journal Volume: 54; Journal Issue: 3","","Medium: ED; Size: p. 140-145","","","EE0007613; 1454433","Journal ID: ISSN 2405-8963","10.1016/j.ifacol.2021.08.232","","2022-09-08T00:00:00Z","1868937","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/1868937","https://www.osti.gov/servlets/purl/1868937","IFAC-PapersOnLine","3","54"

Our objective is to begin answering the question of how such packaged CTES should be implemented within a connected community. We do so by presenting a simulation–optimization workflow employing building energy modeling software and a mixed-integer linear program to design and dispatch a packaged CTES technology to achieve minimum total annual cost. We demonstrate this methodology on a seven-building case study using current utility rates and find that total annual cooling energy costs can be reduced by 17.8% compared to baseline, after accounting for the cost of storage. We perform three parametric sensitivity studies to evaluate modeling assumptions and obtain the prioritization of storage procurement as a function of annualized life-cycle cost of storage.

In this aggregate building energy model, we replace all natural gas and other fossil-fuel furnaces with reversible electric heat pumps of varying efficiencies that can provide heating in the winter and cooling in the summer. We integrate spatially-resolved actual meteorological weather data with the building stock energy model to simulate a specific year (2016) of hourly-resolved energy usage in the ERCOT region. We find the annual electricity consumption, peak hourly power demand for each day, and load duration curves for each of 17 regions within ERCOT. From the base case, the absolute winter peak electrical power demand in the residential sector could increase by as much as 36%, or 12 GW. These results indicate that grid capacity would need to increase by 10 GW (a 25% increase for the residential sector) to accommodate a winter peaking residential sector. Though winter electricity consumption would increase for home heating, the annual amount of electricity consumption would stay roughly the same or decrease because the higher efficiency heat pumps provide more efficient cooling than the conventional air conditioners they also replace. Using average 2018 emissions rates, we estimate a change to standard efficiency heat pumps would lead to a 4.1% reduction of CO<sub>2</sub> emissions and a 5.8% reduction of NO<sub>x</sub> emissions from the residential sector. There is no significant change in SO<sub>x</sub> emissions in our standard efficiency scenario, but in the high and ultra-high aggregate efficiency scenarios, SO<sub>x</sub> emissions are reduced by 8.3% and 15.0% respectively.","Elsevier","","National Renewable Energy Lab.

"Measured Moisture Performance of Sealed and Insulated Attics with Permeable Insulation In California Homes","Walker, Iain S.; Less, Brennan D.","32 ENERGY CONSERVATION, CONSUMPTION, AND UTILIZATION","This study performed detailed thermal and moisture measurements in two homes in Fresno and Clovis, California with sealed attics insulated with glass fiber insulation to determine moisture performance in inland California climates. Data were recorded once every minute for more than a year in each home to allow detailed observation of time-varying moisture and thermal conditions. Moisture measurements were taken at multiple locations in each attic and included wood moisture, surface condensation and surface relative humidity. The results showed that there are strong solar-driven diurnal cycles in attic wood and air moisture content, as well as longer-term seasonal and annual variations. Mold growth was obdserved on the North roof deck in one of the two homes even in this sunny dry climate with attics built in compliance with California building codes that specifically address sealed and insulated attics with vapor-permeable insulation. We investigated moisture stratification in the attic and found that, although there is stratification during sunny daytime hours, this was not when wood moisture content, surface humidity or surface condensation are high. Therefore, other moisture transport mechanisms are acting to increase moisture levels near the roof peak. Finally, our measurements also showed that the attic with the highest measured moisture levels did not have any mold growth, while mold was visually observed in the attic whose measurements indicted little or no concern, indicating that the state-of-the-art in moisture measurement and mold growth prediction in building assemblies may be insufficient.","ASHRAE","","Lawrence Berkeley National Lab.

"Occupant preference-aware load scheduling for resilient communities","Wang, Jing; Huang, Sen; Zuo, Wangda; Vrabie, Draguna","32 ENERGY CONSERVATION, CONSUMPTION, AND UTILIZATION; microgrid; model predictive control; occupant behavior; optimal load scheduling; resilient community; uncertainty","The load scheduling of resilient communities in the islanded mode is subject to many uncertainties such as weather forecast errors and occupant behavior stochasticity. To date, it remains unclear how occupant preferences affect the effectiveness of the load scheduling of resilient communities. This paper proposes an occupant preference-aware load scheduler for resilient communities operating in the islanded mode. The load scheduling framework is formulated as a model predictive control problem. Based on this framework, a deterministic load scheduler is adopted as the baseline. Then, a chance-constrained scheduler is proposed to address the occupant-induced uncertainty in room temperature setpoints. Key resilience indicators are selected to quantify the impacts of the uncertainties on community load scheduling. Finally, the proposed preference-aware scheduler is compared with the deterministic scheduler on a virtual testbed based on a real-world net-zero energy community in Florida, USA. Results show that the proposed scheduler performs better in terms of serving the occupants’ thermal preference and reducing the required battery size, given the presence of the assumed stochastic occupant behavior. Finally, this work indicates that it is necessary to consider the stochasticity of occupant behavior when designing optimal load schedulers for resilient communities.","Elsevier","","National Renewable Energy Lab.

With the rapid development of large-scale building stock energy modeling, surrogate modeling has also begun to be widely applied in this field; however, most existing surrogate models lack hourly time resolution for regional-scale modeling, which is essential for understanding building demand profiles and grid impacts. Further, there is generally a lack of necessary data and feature engineering frameworks specific to building modeling for efficiently managing large datasets and complex computations. Furthermore, this paper proposes a modeling framework for large-scale (city-/region-scale), high-resolution, high-fidelity surrogate building stock energy models. Our developed framework consists of six modules: (1) building stock energy modeling (ComStock<sup>TM</sup> and ResStock<sup>TM</sup>), (2) data engineering for large simulation data, (3) high performance computing workflow, (4) feature engineering, (5) machine learning model development, and (6) model performance evaluation. Two case studies apply the developed framework in both residential and commercial building stock analysis to demonstrate its computational efficiency and surrogate modeling accuracies. Results show that surrogate models, when efficiently trained using the HPC workflow module, reach a high level of modeling accuracy for two case studies.","Elseiver","","National Renewable Energy Lab.

This study develops a methodology to evaluate the effectiveness of passive cooling measures (those that operate without power) to improve residential building heat resilience. Building performance is simulated for representative homes and on district scales in two disadvantaged communities in Fresno, California. Eleven passive measures are evaluated using four heat resilience metrics with and without grid power. Results show performance of the mitigation measures varies by building characteristics, surrounding environment, and power scenario. The two most effective measures were installing solar-control window films and adding roof insulation. For pre-1978 single-family homes, these two measures can reduce unmet degree-hours (UDH) indoors by 12% and 11% respectively without grid power, or 28% and 37% with grid power. Their respective UDH reductions at district scale typically range 8% — 20% and 4% — 12% without grid power, or 14% — 44% and 8% — 51% with grid power. Top floors have higher overheating risk than lower floors during extreme heat events with coincident power outages. Natural ventilation can help, reducing UDH by 21% — 26%. The methodology and findings from this study can help cities, communities, and utilities develop effective and targeted strategies to promote greater residential heat resilience.","Elsevier","","Lawrence Berkeley National Lab.

Experimental tests can be used to investigate the thermal inertia of commercial buildings. However, existing studies tend to be qualitative and have limited scope. In this study, a comprehensive field test has been performed to assess the thermal inertia of commercial buildings. In this field test, six buildings are selected with different sizes, vintages, and types of heating, ventilation, and air conditioning (HVAC) systems to represent the majority of the U.S. commercial building stock. We quantify the thermal inertia with building operation data collected under various thermostat excitation signals. We then studied the relationship between thermal inertia and intrinsic properties, such as floor area, HVAC system, etc., as well as the operation condition indicators such as outdoor air temperature, zone temperature, and occupancy. The testing results indicate that the median values of the normalized charge response time and the normalized discharge response time of the five buildings are 1~5 hr/ °C and -5~-1 hr/ °C, respectively. The results also show that the thermal inertia of commercial buildings may be sensitive to the HVAC system type but not the floor area or location of zones, i.e., core vs. perimeter. Finally, our results suggest that the relationships between the charging/discharging normalized response time and the zone/outdoor temperature may vary among zones and be highly nonlinear.","Elsevier","","Pacific Northwest National Lab.

However, sensor inaccuracy and sensor faults are pervasive in building operation: inaccurate and missing sensor readings deteriorate FDD performance; sensor inaccuracy will also affect the selection of sensor for data-driven FDD in the model training process, which is another key factor of data-driven FDD performance. Sensor accuracy and sensor selection individually are well-studied research topics in this field, but the impact of sensor accuracy on sensor selection and its further impact on FDD performance has not been evaluated and quantified. In this paper, we developed a novel analysis methodology that comprehensively evaluates sensor fault on sensor selection and FDD accuracy. Monte Carlo simulation is applied to deal with multiple stochastic sensor inaccuracy and provide probabilistic analysis results of the impact of sensor inaccuracy on sensor selection and FDD accuracy. This methodology focuses on the net impact of fault states across a full sensor set. The developed methodology can be used for the early-stage sensor design and operation-stage sensor maintenance.

Several smart control strategies were developed with a target of halving ventilation-related energy use, largely through reducing dwelling ventilation rates based on zone occupancy. The controls were evaluated based on the annual energy consumption relative to continuously operating non-zoned, code-compliant mechanical ventilation systems. The systems were also evaluated from an indoor air quality perspective using the equivalency approach, where the annual personal concentration of a contaminant for a control strategy is compared to the personal concentration that would have occurred using a continuously operating, non-zoned system. Individual occupant personal concentrations were calculated for the following contaminants of concern: moisture, CO<sub>2</sub>, particles, and a generic contaminant. Zonal controls that saved energy by reducing outside airflow achieved typical reductions in ventilation-related energy of 10% to 30%, compared to the 7% savings from the unzoned control. However, this was at the expense of increased personal concentrations for some contaminants in most cases. In addition, care is required in the design and evaluation of zonal controls, because control strategies may reduce exposure to some contaminants, while increasing exposure to others.","MDPI AG","","Lawrence Berkeley National Lab.

Integrating thermal energy storage (TES) with building’s HVAC systems has the potential to reshape the electric load profile of the building and mitigate the mismatch between the renewable generation and the demand of buildings. A novel ground source heat pump (GSHP) system integrated with underground thermal energy storage (UTES) has been proposed to level the electric demand of buildings while still satisfying their thermal demands. This study assessed the potential impacts of the proposed system with a bottom-up approach. The impacts on the electricity demand in various electricity markets were quantified. The results show that, within the capacity of the existing electric grids, the maximum penetration rate of the proposed system in different wholesale markets could range from 51% to 100%. Altogether, about 46 million single-family detached houses can be retrofitted into the proposed system without increasing the annual peak demand of the corresponding markets. By implementing the proposed system at its maximum penetration rate, the grid-level summer peak demand can be reduced by 9.1% to 18.2%. Meanwhile, at the grid level, the annual electricity consumption would change by –12% to 2%. The nationwide total electricity consumption would be reduced by 9%.","AMSE","","Oak Ridge National Lab.

Challenges and opportunities of processing via AcoD were presented to review best practices for successful operations. Environmental standards, economic incentives, and governmental policies in the US and around the world regarding waste management and utilization were discussed to identify barriers and sources of opportunity for large-scale implementation of AcoD. Additionally, a range of facilities throughout the US was examined for information regarding digestion type, feedstock (s), biogas production and utilization, and energy self-sufficiency to better understand the current status of FW digestion. Several US facilities were outlined as case studies that co-digest FW and produce and utilize biogas for various applications. Future strategies, perspectives, and roadmaps were discussed to elucidate the shaping of future FW management practices.","Elsevier","","Argonne National Lab.

Here, we assess how electric vehicle charging stations would impact a retail big box grocery store, exploring numerous station sizes, charging power levels, and utilization factors in various climate zones and seasons. We measure the effect of charging by assessing changes in monthly peak power demand, electricity usage, and annual electricity bill, computed using three distinct rate structures. We find that an electric vehicle station has the potential to dwarf a big box building's power demand if behind the same meter, increasing monthly peak power demand at the site by over 250%.

"Evaluating dynamic thermal performance of building envelope components using small-scale calibrated hot box tests","Shen, Zhenglai; Brooks, Adam L.; He, Yawen; Shrestha, Som S.; Zhou, Hongyu","32 ENERGY CONSERVATION, CONSUMPTION, AND UTILIZATION; calibrated hot box test; scaled-down specimen; dynamic thermal performance","The hot box test method has been applied to evaluate both the steady-state (U-value) and dynamic thermal properties of building envelopes. However, the high construction cost of full-scale hot box apparatus and the testing time required (usually several days) may prevent its wider adoption. To overcome the limitations of full-scale hot box tests, here we propose a novel method to evaluate the dynamic thermal performance of building envelope components using a small-scale calibrated hot box and scaled-down specimen. In this paper, the scaling relationships of thermal properties evaluated using a full-size specimen and a scaled-down specimen are established based on the Laplace transform of the heat transfer equations. In addition, dynamic thermal properties obtained from scaled-down experimental tests are compared to the values calculated by the EN ISO13768 (ISO) method. A small-scale hot box with a 355 mm × 355 mm metering area was constructed and calibrated to validate the correlations. Three scaled-down concrete sandwich wall panels were then tested and the scaling relationship was cross-validated using the experimental results, finite difference (FD) simulations, and the ISO method. The results indicate that the dynamic thermal properties obtained from a scaled-down hot box test can be correlated to its full-size counterpart when certain conditions are met. The scaled-down hot box test is demonstrated to be an effective yet economical alternative to a full-scale test with significantly reduced experimentation cost and turn-around time.","Elsevier","","Oak Ridge National Lab.

"A Statistical Evaluation of Combining Human Productivity Metrics in the Indoor Environment","Keene, Kevin M.; Jung, Wooyoung","32 ENERGY CONSERVATION, CONSUMPTION, AND UTILIZATION; Indoor environmental quality; Productivity; Office buildings","The potential of improving human productivity by providing healthy indoor environments has been a consistent interest in the building field for decades. This research field's long-standing challenge is to measure human productivity given the complex nature of office work. Previous studies have diversified productivity metrics, allowing greater flexibility in collecting human data; however, this diversity complicates the ability to combine productivity metrics from disparate studies within a meta-analysis. This study aims to categorize existing productivity metrics and statistically assess which categories show similar behavior when used to measure the impacts of indoor environmental quality. The 106 productivity metrics compiled were grouped into six productivity metric categories: neurobehavioral speed, accuracy, neurobehavioral response time, call handling time, self-reported productivity, and performance score. Then, this study set neurobehavioral speed as the baseline category given its fitness to the efficiency-based definition of productivity (i.e., output versus input) and conducted three statistical analyses with the other categories to evaluate their similarity. As results, the categories of neurobehavioral response time, self-reported productivity, and call handling time were found to have statistical similarity with neurobehavioral speed. This study contributes to creating a constructive research environment for future meta-analyses to understand which human productivity metrics can be combined with each other.","AMSE","","Pacific Northwest National Lab.

Compared with the implementation of phase change materials (PCMs) in opaque components, the energy saving potential of incorporating PCMs in transparent glazing windows is much less studied and not well understood. Here we present a comprehensive parametric study of novel PCM windows for building energy saving with a focus on optimizing and quantitatively distinguishing the contributions from the optical and thermal properties of the PCM, which is particularly useful for the design of solid-solid PCM windows. We investigate a reference commercial office building using EnergyPlus by developing an equivalent model of our PCM window that is compatible with EnergyPlus's modeling capabilities. Compared with a clear-clear double-pane window, the integration of 3 mm solid-solid PCMs with optimal properties in warm, mixed, and cold climates can respectively save up to 17.2%, 14.0%, and 5.8% energy for the HVAC (heating, ventilation, and air conditioning) system, and 9.4%, 6.7%, and 3.2% energy for the whole building. We also demonstrate that these energy savings are most sensitive to the solar absorptance of PCMs for all three climates. The optimal transition temperature varies with climate and is related to the climate and solar radiation heat gain. Other issues are also briefly discussed, such as hysteresis, window orientations, and the effect of interior lighting. Finally, although the optimal PCM windows show energy saving performance comparable with low-emissivity windows, the PCM windows provide a unique advantage in terms of shifting HVAC loads which can provide benefits to the electrical grid.","Elsevier","","Lawrence Berkeley National Lab.

The data were analyzed to determine the amount of time spent in available lighting modes, estimate energy consumption, and to observe any patterns in how the lighting system was being used by occupants. Further analysis revealed opportunities for optimizing the system for occupant needs and energy savings. The patient room occupants were clearly engaged in using the lighting system throughout the 24-hour day to meet needs and preferences. Giving occupants control over the lighting system did not result in a considerable increase in energy use. Implementing a time-out would minimize the extended periods of time when the lights were left on without need at the highest brightness level, further decreasing energy use. This analysis reveals the potential of lighting control data to contribute to energy savings.","Elsevier","","Pacific Northwest National Lab.

Performance assessment of heat pumps, solar thermal collectors, nonfossil fuel-based cogeneration systems, and their hybrid configurations is reported in this study. The impact of design configuration, coefficient of performance (COP), electric grid’s primary energy efficiency on the key attributes of total carbon footprint, life cycle costs, operational energy savings, and site-specific primary energy efficiency are analyzed and discussed in detail. In conclusion, heat pumps and hydrogen-fueled solid oxide fuel cells (SOFCs) are highly effective building energy resources compared to traditional approaches; however, the carbon intensity of electrical energy and hydrogen production are keys to the overall environmental benefit.","AMSE","","Oak Ridge National Lab.

Compared to conventional current-source converter (CSC) based SSTs, a switch reduction scheme on reverse-blocking device bridges is proposed to reduce device count and the number of devices on the DC-link current path. Importantly, the proposed switch reduction scheme is generic and can be applied to the DC ports of DC-AC, AC-DC, or DC-DC hard-switching or soft-switching CSC-based SSTs. Based on this scheme, the proposed current-source DC SSTs are derived, which have reduced electrolytic-capacitor-less DC-link.

Proton-coupled electron transfer (PCET) activation of hydroxyl groups periodically spaced along the polymer backbone furnishes reactive alkoxy radicals that promote chain fragmentation through C–C bond β-scission. The depolymerization produces well-defined and isolable product mixtures that are readily diversified to polycondensation monomers. In addition to controlling depolymerization, the hydroxyl group modulates the thermomechanical properties of these polyolefin derivatives, yielding materials with diverse properties. Furthermore, these results demonstrate a new approach to polymer recycling based on light-driven C–C bond cleavage that has the potential to establish new links within a circular polymer economy and influence the development of new degradable-by-design polyolefin materials.","American Chemical Society (ACS)","","Princeton Univ., NJ (United States); Cornell Univ., Ithaca, NY (United States)","USDOE Office of Science (SC), Basic Energy Sciences (BES)","","United States","2021-07-31T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: Journal of the American Chemical Society; Journal Volume: 143; Journal Issue: 31; Related Information: https://pubs.acs.org/doi/10.1021/jacs.1c05330?goto=supporting-info","","Medium: ED; Size: p. 12268-12277","","","SC0019370","Journal ID: ISSN 0002-7863; DGE-2039656","10.1021/jacs.1c05330","","2022-08-01T00:00:00Z","1843024","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/1843024","https://www.osti.gov/servlets/purl/1843024","Journal of the American Chemical Society","31","143"

Buildings and their cooling systems should be designed and operated to be resilient under such events to protect occupants from potentially dangerous indoor thermal conditions. This study performed a critical review on the state-of-the-art of cooling strategies, with special attention to their performance under heatwaves and power outages. We proposed a definition of resilient cooling and described four criteria for resilience—absorptive capacity, adaptive capacity, restorative capacity, and recovery speed —and used them to qualitatively evaluate the resilience of each strategy. The literature review and qualitative analyses show that to attain resilient cooling, the four resilience criteria should be considered in the design phase of a building or during the planning of retrofits. The building and relevant cooling system characteristics should be considered simultaneously to withstand extreme events. A combination of strategies with different resilience capacities, such as a passive envelope strategy coupled with a low-energy space-cooling solution, may be needed to obtain resilient cooling. Finally, a further direction for a quantitative assessment approach has been pointed out.","Elsevier","","Lawrence Berkeley National Lab.

Different from dual active bridge (DAB) SST, the operation of the current-source SST is similar to that of a flyback converter. The device bridge on only one side of the transformer is active to store energy into or release energy from the magnetizing inductance which acts as a current-source dc link. Such flyback operation with reverse-blocking switches can lead to additional device voltage stress and incomplete zero-voltage switching (ZVS) on the current-source soft-switching solid-state transformer (S4T) under conventional modulation. A new modulation scheme is proposed to address this issue. Moreover, different from the DAB, the leakage inductance of the medium-frequency transformer (MFT) in the S4T is a parasitic element similar to that in a matrix SST and can cause additional device voltage stress. Though the resonant capacitors, originally added to achieve ZVS, can absorb and recycle the leakage energy in the S4T, these capacitors need to be increased with larger leakage inductances to limit the voltage stress. However, large resonant capacitors can result in more lost duty cycles and reduced efficiency. The impact of such leakage inductance on device voltage stress is analyzed comprehensively, which is critical to guide future research and design of the S4T. Experimental results from S4T prototypes for DC-DC, multiport AC-DC, and AC-AC conversion with 1:1 and 4:1 MFT comprehensively verify the proposed concepts. Lastly, a case study of a three-phase AC-AC S4T over a power range from 1 kVA to 100 kVA each module reveals that the MFT leakage inductance should be less than 1% of the magnetizing inductance for safe operation.","IEEE","","Georgia Institute of Technology, Atlanta, GA (United States)","USDOE Advanced Research Projects Agency - Energy (ARPA-E)","","United States","2021-08-04T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: IEEE Transactions on Power Electronics; Journal Volume: 37; Journal Issue: 1","","Medium: ED; Size: p. 562-576","","","AR0000899","Journal ID: ISSN 0885-8993","10.1109/tpel.2021.3101811","","2022-10-19T00:00:00Z","1892477","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/1892477","https://www.osti.gov/servlets/purl/1892477","IEEE Transactions on Power Electronics","1","37"

Today, increasing emphasis is being placed on demand response (DR) programs that incentivize customers to reduce, or “shed” electric load during grid peak periods. The most common methods used to predict building peaks and quantify DR load reductions rely on simple averaging algorithms using hourly load and temperature data from the days preceding the DR event. In contrast, regression-based algorithms have been used for decades to quantify annual energy efficiency savings. The availability of smart meter data has enabled application of hourly regressions for more accurate energy savings estimation, often referred to as “advanced measurement and verification (M&V).” This project explored whether advanced M&V regression approaches offer improvements over simpler averaging approaches for peak load prediction in commercial buildings. We present evaluation results for eight algorithms (based on three baseline modeling approaches). The findings show that all algorithms underpredicted consumption across 453 meters and over 1,100 peak load days. Median bias values varied between 4.5 and 18.7 percent, indicating that the methods evaluated would tend to understate achieved load reductions in DR applications for these buildings. The regression methods did not offer a notable advantage over the commonly used averaging methods.","Elsevier","","Lawrence Berkeley National Lab.

"Total System Performance Ratio—A Systems Based Approach for Evaluating HVAC System Efficiency","Goel, Supriya; Rosenberg, Michael I.; Gonzalez, Juan; Lerond, Jérémy","32 ENERGY CONSERVATION, CONSUMPTION, AND UTILIZATION; building simulation; system performance; HVAC system performance; performance-based codes; net zero codes","The prescriptive path is the most widely used approach for commercial code compliance in the United States. Though easy to implement, prescriptive approaches do not typically discriminate between minimally compliant, high-performing and poorly performing HVAC system configurations. Hence, to meet aggressive energy and carbon reduction goals, it is clear that energy codes will need to transition from prescriptive to performance-based approaches, a transition that is riddled with several challenges. This paper discusses a new HVAC system-based performance approach (HVAC System Performance) which provides a simpler solution to HVAV system evaluation compared to whole building performance, while keeping tradeoffs limited to specific building systems. The Total System Performance Ratio (TSPR) is a metric for evaluation of overall system efficiency instead of individual component efficiency, a solution which could also eventually facilitate the transition to a 100% performance-based code structure. TSPR is a ratio that compares the annual heating and cooling load of a building to the annual energy consumed by the building’s HVAC system. A calculation software tool has been developed for determining a building’s TSPR. Already incorporated into the 2018 Washington State Energy Code, this approach is also being evaluated by ASHRAE Standard 90.l Project Committee and has the potential to provide a comprehensive performance-based approach for HVAC system evaluation and analysis.","MDPI","","Pacific Northwest National Lab.

"Learning-based CO<sub>2</sub> concentration prediction: Application to indoor air quality control using demand-controlled ventilation","Taheri, Saman; Razban, Ali","32 ENERGY CONSERVATION, CONSUMPTION, AND UTILIZATION; Air quality index; CO2 data collection; HVAC energy consumption; occupant-centric control; machine learning.","There have been increasing concerns over the air quality inside buildings as high levels of bio-effluents can cause nausea, dizziness, headaches, and fatigue to the people working in those spaces. First published in 2004 as Standard 62.1, ASHRAE Standard 62.2-2019 requires highly occupied spaces to implement heating, ventilation, and air conditioning (HVAC) that can dilute contaminants produced by occupants. In this regard, occupant-centric ventilation control has been regarded as an effective practice to maintain a satisfactory indoor air quality (IAQ) when dealing with highly variable occupancy environments. However, few established models in current literature and practice consider dynamic occupancy behavior and adaptive IAQ control. To address this gap, a dynamic indoor CO2 model is constructed using machine learning algorithms to forecast CO2concentrations across a range of forecasting horizons. Herein, we tuned and compared six state-of-the-algorithms—including Support Vector Machine, Ada Boost, Random Forest, Gradient Boosting, Logistic Regression, and Multilayer Perceptron. The algorithms’ performances are validated using CO<sub>2</sub> and historical meteorological data collected from a campus classroom with a variable occupancy rate. Simulation results showed that Multilayer Perceptron can strongly predict the volatile CO<sub>2</sub> behavior and also outperforms other algorithms in terms of accuracy. Furthermore, a control strategy capable of modeling and detecting dynamic patterns of CO<sub>2</sub> level is utilized to modulate the ventilation rate in real-time and also reduce the energy consumption. The proposed controller reduced the HVAC fan’s energy consumption by 51.4% and provide ventilation as needed per the ASHRAE standards.","Elsevier","","Indiana Univ.-Purdue Univ.

Decarbonization strategies to reduce overall carbon dioxide emissions are urgently needed. Among the numerous decarbonization strategies that are being defined and implemented, a particular strategy of interest for the present work is “the Re-X or zero waste” strategy, which involves recycling, reuse, repurposing, and remanufacturing of industrial emissions, by-products, and waste in general. A circular value chain or Circular Economy is embedded within this strategy. In a circular carbon economy, efficient reuse of emitted carbon dioxide is considered. However, the stability of carbon dioxide implies the requirement of significant amounts of energy for its transformation into value-added chemicals or products, which must be supplied by low carbon emitting energy sources. Nuclear power plants are low carbon energy sources that, additionally to electricity, could also supply heat and radiation for chemical transformations. This work identifies the opportunities and challenges for the development of integrated energy systems to upgrade and transform carbon dioxide, involving chemical and nuclear energy. The analysis encompasses possible use of the different forms of energy that can be obtain from nuclear reactors (i.e., radiation, electricity, and heat), by reviewing the published literature on potential routes for its conversion. Overall, our review indicates that an universal technology of the one-fits-all solution-type is an utopic dream.

"Comparative Performance of Low Global Warming Potential (GWP) Refrigerants as Replacement for R-410A in a Regular 2-Speed Heat Pump for Sustainable Cooling","Shen, Bo; Ally, Moonis R. (ORCID:0000000289661950)","32 ENERGY CONSERVATION, CONSUMPTION, AND UTILIZATION; alternate refrigerants; heat pumps; simulation; exergy","<p>Heat pumps are currently being developed to reduce the energy footprint for residential and commercial building space conditioning and water heating loads in cold climates. To mitigate the nocuous impact of greenhouse gas emissions on the environment, and to create a carbon-neutral building stock, alternate lower-GWP refrigerants must also replace the predominant use of R-410A, without re-engineering the mechanical hardware. In this paper, we analyze the performance of lower-GWP alternative refrigerants (R-32, R-452B, R-454B, and R-466A) relative to the conventional R-410A and draw conclusions on the relative performances to meet cooling loads. The simulations are accomplished using the heat pump design model, a well-known, public-domain design tool with a free web interface and downloadable desktop version to support public use and the HVAC R&D community. The contributions contain detailed, hardware-based heat exchanger and system analyses to provide a comprehensive assessment. The results of the simulation are scrutinized from the first (capacity and energy efficiency) and second laws (exergy analysis) to identify sources of systemic inefficiency, the root cause of lost work. This rigorous approach provides an exhaustive analysis of alternate lower-GWP refrigerants to replace R-410A using the same hardware. The results have practical value in engineering heat pumps in an economy that is compelled to alter by the consequences and uncertainties of climate change, to reduce its anthropogenic carbon footprint.</p>","MDPI AG","","Oak Ridge National Lab.

"Hepa filter age evaluation and estimate of nominal lifetime in nuclear facilities","Barnett, J. Matthew (ORCID:0000000153810064); Schrank, Kobe R.; Bliss, Mary (ORCID:0000000275654813); Cooley, Scott K.","42 ENGINEERING; 32 ENERGY CONSERVATION, CONSUMPTION, AND UTILIZATION; HEPA; Filter, Age; Statistics; Compliance","In 2020, PNNL completed a literature search for high-efficiency particulate air (HEPA) filter age information. HEPA filters are used in many operations to remove particulate matter from effluent exhaust streams. They are thought to degrade over time both during proper storage and during normal operational service; however, the rate at which the filters degrade remains unknown. This brings into question if age is an adequate indicator of HEPA filter performance. Data from six previous reports were obtained from the literature search and combined to create a data set of 1600 operating filters. Filter usage was identified from multiple facilities. The various types of filters (e.g., axial flow, self-contained, and standard 61 x 61 x 28 cm; and both separator and separatorless) reported were constructed to the requirements Section FC (HEPA Filters) or Section FK (Special HEPA Filters) of the American Society of Mechanical Engineers AG-1 code. Filters were presumed to have continuously met the operational criteria and in particular passed both annual efficiency tests and annual DP measurements. The environmental conditions within the exhaust system were also assumed adequate for long-term filter operation. The data, by the nature of the reports, excludes rejected filters from quality assurance evaluations, intake, or installation testing. The collective data set shows over half of were operating past the current 10-year Department of Energy (DOE) limit. Data was evaluated for age lifetime using a linear trendline, survival function, probability functions, and failure rate; financial impacts were also addressed. This report supports the notion that HEPA filters can operate safely and efficiently under proper maintenance well past the 10-year lifetime established by DOE. Using the results of the four age evaluation approaches, they collectively point to the reasonableness of an operating HEPA filter lifetime of 20 years. The results are not necessarily definitive, but nevertheless, they are promising. The analysis provides reasonable assurance that when implemented using a graded approach with well-defined performance and operational requirements, extending the service life for HEPA filters beyond 10 years is low risk.","Elsevier","","Pacific Northwest National Lab.

"The energy saving potential of thermo-responsive desiccants for air dehumidification","Zeng, Yi; Woods, Jason; Cui, Shuang","32 ENERGY CONSERVATION, CONSUMPTION, AND UTILIZATION; dehumidification; desiccant wheel; energy efficiency; thermo-responsive solid desiccant","The desiccant wheel is a promising technology for energy-efficient humidity control. However, its overall efficiency—hindered by the desiccant materials’ properties—remains low because traditional desiccants (e.g., silica gels) have a single isotherm regardless of their adsorption temperature. Thermo-responsive materials have been proposed to break this fixed affinity to water vapor, with drastically different adsorption isotherms depending on temperature. Its potential for improving dehumidification efficiency, however, has not been addressed. In this paper, we model the potential of a thermo-responsive interpenetrating polymer network (IPN) desiccant with temperature-dependent adsorption isotherms for energy-efficient dehumidification via a validated transient desiccant wheel model for humidity control of buildings. Thermo-responsive desiccants can improve the dehumidification performance due to their thermo-responsive switchable hydrophilicity below/above the lower critical solution temperature. Our analysis shows that thermo-responsive IPN desiccants can potentially reduce energy consumption by up to 30% compared to silica gels. Finally, the savings depend strongly on the critical temperature of the thermo-responsive desiccant and should be higher when the inlet temperatures are expected to be higher.","Elsevier","","National Renewable Energy Lab.

It does so by examining net-zero carbon strategies with quantitative, qualitative, and integrative dimensions across discrete location-specific systems and timescales. The generalizable framework is designed with a flexibility and logic that allows for refinement to accompany stakeholder review processes and highly localized decision-making. To highlight the framework’s applicability across multiple timescales, processes, and types of knowledge, power system outages are reviewed for extreme weather events, including 2021 and 2011 winter storms that impacted Texas, the 2017 Hurricane Maria that affected Puerto Rico, and a heatwave/wildfire event in California in August 2020. By design, the meta-level framework enables utility decision-makers, regulators, insurers, and communities to analyze and track levels of resilience safeguards for a given system.

The purpose of this research was to develop an integrated chilled water modeling technique that can determine the optimal system setpoints and estimate the energy saving potential of chiller system. The chiller system equipped with Variable Frequency Drives (VFDs) on cooling tower fans and condenser water pumps. To accomplish the objective, physical component models of the centrifugal chiller, cooling tower and condenser water pump were established with the goal of incorporating the system’s condenser water flow rate and cooling tower fan speeds as optimization variables. Furthermore, a cooling load prediction algorithm was developed using a multiple non-linear regression model to approximate the building’s cooling load subject to a range of environmental conditions. The inputs and outputs of the individual component models were linked to estimate how adjusting the cooling tower fan and condenser water pump speed would influence the system’s comprehensive performance. Here, the overall system model was then optimized using a generalized reduced gradient optimization algorithm to determine the potential energy savings through speed control with VFDs and to ascertain a control logic strategy for the building automation system to operate the heating and cooling system. A case-study was performed on a single chiller system at a museum and the model was calibrated according to logged data collected over four months. Results showed that for the system analyzed, the energy saving of optimizing the cooling tower fan system was found to be 12–15%, while the energy saving potential of optimizing the condenser water pump with the cooling tower fan was negligible. Additionally, comparing different cooling tower fan control strategies showed that a wet-bulb approach-based cooling tower control strategy was shown to have the highest correlation to the optimized fan speed with an R<sup>2</sup> of 0.924.","Elsevier","","Indiana Univ., Indianapolis, IN (United States)","USDOE Office of Energy Efficiency and Renewable Energy (EERE), Energy Efficiency Office.

Previous research has mostly focused on the adaptive strategies triggered by occupants' indoor discomfort; however, it is crucial to understand if specific adaptive strategies are linked to occupants' energy-saving intentions. This study explores the relationships among employees’ heuristic decision-making in their first choice of adaptive strategies (technological solutions or personal adjustments) when facing extreme discomfort conditions, and their energy-saving intentions, then links these patterns with building design, workplace contextual factors, and demographics. A cross-sectional survey was collected among university employees from China, Brazil, Italy, Poland, Switzerland, and the US. Our results demonstrated that the accessibility to indoor environmental controls (IECs) and office type are the significant factors for adaptive strategies. There was a positive relationship between the number of IEC features and the percentage of employees choosing a technological solution. When feeling too hot, occupants in private offices are more likely to adopt a technological solution, whereas occupants in cubicles are more likely to choose a personal adjustment. Occupants with energy-saving intentions are less likely to choose thermostat adjustments or use portable devices as adaptive strategies than their counterparts.

"Material flows and GHG emissions from housing stock evolution in US counties, 2020–60","Berrill, Peter; Hertwich, Edgar G.","32 ENERGY CONSERVATION, CONSUMPTION, AND UTILIZATION","The evolution of housing stocks determines demand for construction materials and energy, and associated emissions of greenhouse gasses (GHGs). The contribution of construction to building life-cycle emissions is growing as buildings become more energy efficient and the energy supply decarbonizes. A housing stock model is developed for counties in the United States using dynamic vacancy rates which endogenously influence stock out- and inflows. Stocks of three house types and 10 construction cohorts are projected for all contiguous US counties for the period 2020–60. Inflows and outflows of construction materials are then estimated along with GHG emissions associated with material production and construction activities in scenarios defined by stock turnover rates, population share by house type, and floor area characteristics of new houses. The results provide new insights into the drivers of construction-related emissions at local and national levels, and identify opportunities for their reduction. Demolition material flows grow in relation to construction material flows over the analysis period. Increasing the stock turnover rate increases future floor area per person, material requirements, and emissions from construction. Scenarios with reduced floor area and more multifamily homes in new construction have lower floor area growth, material requirements, and emissions from construction.","Ubiquity Press","","Yale Univ., New Haven, CT (United States); REMADE Inst. of Sustainable Manufacturing Innovation Alliance Corp., West Henrietta, NY (United States)","USDOE Office of Energy Efficiency and Renewable Energy (EERE), Energy Efficiency Office.

The proposed method uses systematic encoding of physics-based prior knowledge into a structured recurrent neural architecture. Specifically, our method incorporates structural prior knowledge from traditional physics-based building modeling into the architecture of the deep neural network model. Further, we also use penalty methods to provide inequality constraints, thereby bounding predictions within physically realistic and safe operating ranges. We observe that stable eigenvalues accurately characterize the dissipativeness of the system, and use a constrained matrix parameterization based on the Perron-Frobenius theorem to bound the dominant eigenvalues of the building thermal model parameter matrices. We demonstrate the effectiveness and physical interpretability of the proposed data-driven modeling approach on a real-world dataset obtained from an office building with 20 thermal zones. The proposed data-driven method can learn interpretable dynamical models that achieve high accuracy and generalization over long-term prediction horizons. We show that using only 10 days’ measurements for training, our method is capable of generalizing over 20 consecutive days. We demonstrate that the proposed modeling methodology is achieving state-of-the-art performance by significantly improving the accuracy and generalization compared to classical system identification methods and prior advanced methods reported in the literature. compared to prior state-of-the-art methods reported in the literature.","Elsevier","","Pacific Northwest National Lab.

Load synchronization, as a result of naturally occurring and demand-response events, has the potential to damage power distribution equipment. Because thermostatically controlled loads constitute most of the power consumed by the grid at any given time, the proper control of such devices can lead to significant energy savings and improved grid stability. The contribution of this paper is the development of an optimal control algorithm for commonly used variable speed heat pumps. By means of selective peer-to-peer communication, our control architecture allows for the regulation of home temperatures while simultaneously minimizing aggregate power consumption, and aggregate load volatility. An optimal centralized controller is also explored and compared against its decentralized counterpart.","MDPI","","Boise State Univ., ID (United States)","USDOE Office of Energy Efficiency and Renewable Energy (EERE), Energy Efficiency Office.

It can lead to more than 70% energy saving, compared with electric resistance heating. HPWH usually uses a wrapped-tank coil as the water heater. The wrapped coil has a strong interaction with the water tank and impose a new challenge for the engineering design and simulation study. Based on the US DOE/ORNL Heat Pump Design Model (HPDM), i.e., a public-domain, component-based thermal system modelling platform, a segment-to-segment wrapped-tank coil model coupled with a one-dimensional stratified water tank model were developed, which facilitates modeling and design HPWHs having various configurations and components. Additionally, the hardware-based design model was used to evaluate refrigerants having lower global warming potentials to replace R-134a, including R-1234yf, R-1234ze, R-290, R-513A and R-450A, when effects of compressor size, refrigerant charge on 24-hour uniform energy factor (UEF) and first-hour rating (FHR) were investigated.In the drop-in replacements, R-1234ze achieved the best UEF, and R-290 resulted in the lowest UEF. When downsizing the compressor to maximize the UEFs, the UEFs of R-134a, R-290, R1234yf, R-450A and R-513A ascended to the range of 4.4 to 4.53, with R-513A having the highest UEF. The R-1234ze ended up having the lowest UEF of 4.27. Refrigerants having larger volumetric vaporization heat led to higher FHRs if using the fixed-size compressor, that R-290 resulted in the highest FHR.","Elsevier","","Oak Ridge National Lab.

Using multiple cooling processes at different temperatures allows SSLC to save energy by raising the evaporation temperature of the sensible cooling process. In this paper, all possible airflow configurations of SSLC systems are enumerated under the following constraints: exactly two heat exchangers are used, and air is recirculated to the conditioned space (no exhaust or outdoor air treatment). Seven designs are identified, with varying free operating variables, and each is modeled. Analysis reveals that several configurations are equivalent, and there is only one unique basic airflow SSLC configuration: the one with the sensible and latent heat exchangers placed in series. The efficiency of the SSLC system is compared against that of the conventional system. Under standard conditions, an SSLC system can improve the coefficient of performance by 14.8%. In addition to the numerical simulation, the optimal operating condition of the basic air configuration of the SSLC system is derived analytically. The basic SSLC system is shown to offer the highest performance improvement when the outdoor temperature is relatively cool and the space sensible heat ratio is high.","Elsevier","","Oak Ridge National Lab.

"How Can Floor Covering Influence Buildings’ Demand Flexibility?","Ahn, Hyeunguk; Liu, Jingjing; Kim, Donghun; Yin, Rongxin; Hong, Tianzhen; Piette, Mary Ann","32 ENERGY CONSERVATION, CONSUMPTION, AND UTILIZATION; demand response; precooling; thermal inertia; cooling load; grid-interactive building","Although the thermal mass of floors in buildings has been demonstrated to help shift cooling load, there is still a lack of information about how floor covering can influence the floor’s load shifting capability and buildings’ demand flexibility. To fill this gap, we estimated demand flexibility based on the daily peak cooling load reduction for different floor configurations and regions, using EnergyPlus simulations. As a demand response strategy, we used precooling and global temperature adjustment. The result demonstrated an adverse impact of floor covering on the building’s demand flexibility. Specifically, under the same demand response strategy, the daily peak cooling load reductions were up to 20–34% for a concrete floor whereas they were only 17–29% for a carpet-covered concrete floor. This is because floor covering hinders convective coupling between the concrete floor surface and the zone air and reduces radiative heat transfer between the concrete floor surface and the surrounding environment. In hot climates such as Phoenix, floor covering almost negated the concrete floor’s load shifting capability and yielded low demand flexibility as a wood floor, representing low thermal mass. Sensitivity analyses showed that floor covering’s effects can be more profound with a larger carpet-covered area, a greater temperature adjustment depth, or a higher radiant heat gain. With this effect ignored for a given building, its demand flexibility would be overestimated, which could prevent grid operators from obtaining sufficient demand flexibility to maintain a grid. Our findings also imply that for more efficient grid-interactive buildings, a traditional standard for floor design could be modified with increasing renewable penetration.","MDPI","","Lawrence Berkeley National Lab.

The authors conclude that (1) hot water percentages for showers and faucets calculated using up-to-date, publicly available national data are consistent with those found by regional studies and household-level models of water use; (2) the accuracy of heating energy savings estimates attributable to WaterSense-labeled lavatory products, as well as associated emissions reductions, can be refined by modifying the existing energy factor/uniform energy factor (EF/UEF)-based estimation approach with available data. The refined approach accounts for more nuanced conditions than the EF/UED-based approach but depends on data not always available; and (3) the approaches described and intermediate outputs can be generalized for other water conservation programs or estimating purposes.","Elsevier","","Lawrence Berkeley National Lab.

Many occupant-centric key performance indicators (KPIs) rely on having accurate counts of the number of occupants in a building, which is very different to how occupancy information is currently collected in the majority of buildings today. To address this gap, the authors develop a standardized methodology for the calculation of percent space utilization for buildings, which is formulated with respect to two prevalent operational data schemas: the Brick Schema and Project Haystack. The methodology is scalable across different levels of spatial granularity and irrespective of sensor placement. Moreover, the methods are intended to make use of typical occupancy sensors that capture presence level occupancy and not counts of people. Since occupant-hours is a preferable metric to use in KPI calculations, a method to convert between percent space utilization and occupant-hours using the design occupancy for a space is also developed. The methodology is demonstrated on a small commercial office space in Boulder, Colorado using data collected between June 2018 and February 2019. A multiple linear regression is performed that shows strong evidence for a relationship between building energy consumption and percent space utilization.","MDPI AG","","National Renewable Energy Lab.

It is useful to analyze resilience issues not only for bulk supply, but at all levels including at a customer level. This is because distributed energy resources can play a prominent role in enhancing resilience. Although the literature on planning models, tools and data for bulk supply and distribution systems have expanded in recent years, customer-centric planning, e.g., for an individual household, is yet to receive adequate attention. Although solar PV and battery storage at a household level have been analyzed, how these resources can be optimally combined, together with grid supply, from a resilience perspective is the focus of this study. The study demonstrates how a conceptual framework can be developed to show the trade-off between system costs and resilience including its dimensions such as duration, depth and frequency of service outages. A planning model is developed that incorporates multiple facets of resilience and individual customer preferences. The model considers power system resilience explicitly as a constraint. The model is implemented for a household level case study in Miami, Florida. The results show there are complex trade-offs among different dimensions of resilience. The study demonstrates how combined resilience metrics can be formulated and evaluated using the proposed least-cost planning model at a household level to optimize grid supply together with solar, battery storage and diesel generators. The model allows a planner to directly embed a resilience standard to drive the optimal supply mix.

First-order martensitic structural transitions from the Ni2In-type hexagonal austenite phase to the TiNiSi-type orthorhombic martensite phase spanned a wide temperature window (>200 K) as a result of quenching the samples at temperatures ranging from the solid phase at 700 °C to the liquid phase at 1150 °C. Despite the large variation in their structural transition temperatures, the changes in cell parameters across the structural transitions and the Curie–Weiss temperatures of the martensite/austenite phase were relatively small. For the sample quenched from 800 °C, coupled magnetostructural transitions were observed, and the largest maximum magnetic entropy change was found to be -ΔS<sub>max</sub> = 33:6 J/kg K for a 7-T field change. The coupled magnetostructural transitions and the corresponding magnetic entropy enhancements were found to also be achievable by applying hydrostatic pressures. Meanwhile, as the quenching temperatures or hydrostatic pressures increased, the first-order martensitic structural transition shifted toward lower temperature until it was ultimately absent, in which case only the crystal structure and magnetic transition of the Ni<sub>2</sub>In-type hexagonal austenite phase were present.","American Institute of Physics (AIP)","","Louisiana State Univ., Baton Rouge, LA (United States); Southern Illinois Univ., Carbondale, IL (United States)","USDOE Office of Science (SC), Basic Energy Sciences (BES); National Science Foundation (NSF); Ministry of Science and Technology of Taiwan (MOST)","","United States","2021-06-07T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: Journal of Applied Physics; Journal Volume: 129; Journal Issue: 21","","Medium: ED; Size: Article No. 215108","","","SC0010521; FG02-13ER46946; FG02-06ER46291; DMR-1904636; MOST-107-2218-E-131-007-MY3","Journal ID: ISSN 0021-8979; NSF-DMR-1904636; MOST 107-2218-E-131-007-MY3; TRN: US2306237","10.1063/5.0053671","","2023-04-12T00:00:00Z","1868094","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/1868094","https://www.osti.gov/servlets/purl/1868094","Journal of Applied Physics","21","129"

Prior work has demonstrated that UCE analysis can serve as a diagnostic tool for energy efficiency investigations and detailed load analysis. While explaining the feature selection of deep networks with certainty is often not fully comprehensive, or in other applications, quite lacking, additional tools/methods for further corroboration and confirmation can help further the understanding of the researcher. This is true especially in the subject application of the study in this paper. Often the focus of such efforts is the selected features themselves, and there is not as much understanding gained about the noise in the collected data. If selected feature and noise characteristics are known, it can be used to further shape the design of the deep network or associated preprocessing. This is additionally difficult when the available data are limited, as in the case which the authors investigated in this study. Here, the authors present a novel work (which is a proposed complementary portion of the overall solution to the deep network classification explainability problem for this application) by applying a systematic progression of preprocessing and a deep neural network (ResNet architecture) to classify UCE data obtained via current transformers. By using a methodical application of preprocessing techniques prior to a deep classifier, hypotheses can be produced concerning what features the deep network deems important relative to what it perceives as noise. For instance, it is hypothesized in this particular study as a result of execution of the proposed method and periodic inspection of the classifier output that the UCE spectral features are relatively close to each other or to the interferers, as systematically reducing the beta parameter of the Kaiser window produced progressively better classification performance, but only to a point, as going below the Beta of eight produced decreased classifier performance, as well as the hypothesis that further spectral feature resolution was not as important to the classifier as rejection of the leakage from a spectrally distant interference. This can be very important in unpredictable low-FNR applications, where knowing the difference between features and noise is difficult. As a side-benefit, much was learned regarding the best preprocessing to use with the selected deep network for the UCE collected from these low power consumer devices obtained via current transformers. Baseline rectangular windowed FFT preprocessing provided a 62% classification increase versus using raw samples. After performing a more optimal preprocessing, more than 90% classification accuracy was achieved across 18 low-power consumer devices for scenarios in which the in-band features-to-noise ratio (FNR) was very poor.</p>","MDPI AG","","Oak Ridge National Lab.

From a system-level perspective, such programs reduce costs, enhance reliability, and reduce network issues. Similarly, DSM programs help participating customers reduce utility bills while maintaining occupant comfort. Understanding the relationship between EE and DF is key to realizing the full potential of DSM programs. In this study, we modeled an all-electric residential community based on a 498-home community that is planned for construction in Fort Collins, Colorado in the United States. We used this community model to study the relationship between different EE measures, including building envelope upgrades and smart appliances, and DF enabled by a home energy management system (HEMS) responding to a time-varying tariff. Various EE levels in the homes – code-minimum, zero energy ready, and even higher levels of envelope efficiency – were simulated. DF is enabled by the HEMS, which coordinates behind-the-meter resources, including flexible building loads, PV, and home battery systems, to minimize utility bills while maintaining occupant comfort. When comparing to the code-minimum homes, EE upgrades alone reduce HVAC energy use during peak hours by up to 50% and the HVAC utility bill by up to $312/year. With the addition of HEMS, the average daily peak demand can be reduced by up to 0.58 MW or 1.2 kW/home in the higher envelope efficiency homes. The combination of EE upgrades, HEMS, and home battery systems is expected to save homeowners up to $590/year while increasing community load flexibility. However, HEMS and home battery systems are less effective in increasing the DF in the more efficient homes due to the lower load.","Elsevier","","National Renewable Energy Lab.

Compact, tabular BSDFs may be derived via interpolation, discretization and/or compression from goniophotometer measurements. These data-driven BSDFs can represent any measurable distribution to the limits of their tabulated resolution, making them more general than parametric or analytical BSDFs, which are restricted to a particular class of materials. However, tabulated BSDFs present a trade-off between higher sampling loads versus lower directional accuracy during simulation. Low-resolution BSDFs (e.g., Klems basis) may be adequate for calculating solar heat gains but fall short when applied to daylight glare predictions. The tensor-tree representation moderates this trade-off using a variable-resolution basis, providing detail where needed at an acceptable cost. Independently, a peak extraction algorithm isolates direct transmission from any tabular BSDF, enabling high-resolution beam radiation and glare analysis through transmitting systems with a “vision” component. Our data-driven BSDF methods were validated with a pilot study of a fabric shade installed in an outdoor, full-scale office testbed. Comparisons between measurement and simulation were made for vertical illuminance, specular and near-specular transmission, and daylight glare probability. Models based on high resolution BSDF measurements yielded superior results when accounting for anisotropy compared to isotropic models. Models with higher resolution produced more accurate source luminance data than low-resolution models. Further validation work is needed to better characterize generality of observed trends from this pilot study.","Elsevier","","Lawrence Berkeley National Lab.

"Evaluation of the Passive Cooling Potential of Thermal Mass Inherent in Medium to Large Commercial Buildings","Nelson, John; Henze, Gregor","32 ENERGY CONSERVATION, CONSUMPTION, AND UTILIZATION; commercial buildings; thermal properties; energy efficiency","Typical commercial construction inherently contains large surface areas of relatively thin mass located in the floor slabs. This research asks how effective this mass could be for passive cooling, relative to other mass depths, if it were to be exposed and used as thermal mass. Although much of the rich literature on thermal mass has been conducted with far greater mass depths, a more limited amount of research suggests that because the surface heat transfer rate is limited, the focus should be on the surface area of exposed mass, not its depth. This presents an opportunity for more buildings to behave more thermally massively, if the mass inherent in typical floor slabs contains utility, particularly over diurnal cycles. In all climates analyzed, it was found that there is a pronounced shoulder where energy savings from passive cooling of increasing mass depths was steep until roughly 7.5–10 cm, and beyond this point the achieved energy savings diminished rapidly. When considering the embodied energy of concrete, the incremental benefit of added mass beyond a typical topping slab of 10 cm does not justify the incremental embodied energy cost from a total energy standpoint alone.","American Society of Civil Engineers","","National Renewable Energy Lab.

To help accelerate efficiency improvements, this study identifies “best-in-class” high-efficiency RAC components and products. The findings show that manufacturers tend to minimize manufacturing costs by using RAC designs that are readily available or standardized to their production, and they share components across various models. High-efficiency RAC models use advanced compressor technologies optimized at a low frequency, large heat exchangers with thermodynamically effective materials and designs, highly efficient direct current fan motors, advanced metering devices, and smart sensors for temperature and humidity control. Recently RAC manufacturers have been improving seasonal efficiency – better reflecting part-load operation – especially via variable-speed (inverter) drives for compressor motors. Recent highest-efficiency RAC models use low global warming potential (GWP) refrigerants, having transitioned from conventional high-GWP refrigerants, in regions where RACs that use these low-GWP refrigerants are commercially available. Recently demonstrated innovative technologies show trends toward smart hybrid designs, evaporative cooling, and solid-state materials beyond the conventional vapor-compression technology. This information could help policymakers improve their RAC market-transformation programs to align with the most-efficient global technology.","Elsevier","","Lawrence Berkeley National Lab.

These systems are conventionally controlled individually without considering their interactions, affecting the building’s overall energy inefficiency and occupant comfort. A model predictive control (MPC) system that features a multi-objective MPC scheme to enable coordinated control of multiple building services for overall optimized energy efficiency, indoor thermal and visual comfort, as well as a hybrid model for predicting indoor visual comfort and lighting power is proposed. The MPC system was implemented in a test facility having two identical, side-by-side experimental cells to facilitate comparison with a building management system (BMS) employing conventional reactive feedback control. The MPC system coordinated the control of the ACMV, dynamic façade and automated dimmable lighting systems in one cell while the BMS controlled the building services in the other cell in a conventional manner. The MPC side achieved 15.1–20.7% electricity consumption reduction, as compared to the BMS side. Simultaneously, the MPC system improved indoor thermal comfort by maintaining the room within the comfortable range (-0.5 < predicted mean vote < 0.5) for 98.3% of the time, up from 91.8% of the time on the BMS side. Visual comfort, measured by indoor daylight glare probability (DGP) and horizontal illuminance level at work plane height, was maintained for the entire test period on the MPC side, improving from having visual comfort for 94.5% and 85.7% of the time, respectively, on the BMS side.","Elsevier","","National Renewable Energy Lab.

Passive components like bulky dc links limit the power density of power converters, especially medium-voltage (MV) SST. Reduced dc-link or low-inertia converters can dramatically reduce the size, cost, and weight by tolerating larger dc-link ripples and improve the reliability with electrolytic capacitor-less dc link. However, a small dc link leads to tight coupling between the input and the output stages, which is a challenge for control design. In stacked low-inertia converters (SLIC), the low-inertia converter modules are stacked for MV applications, resulting in coupling between the modules and making the control more challenging. A new model predictive control method which can achieve deadbeat regulation on the dc link without weighting factors has been proposed to address this novel problem. This paper focuses on analyzing the condition of the low-inertia dc link up to 80% ripple, the robustness of the control under parameter mismatches, high-order terms, and important implementation issues such as model-based sampling and computation delay compensation. Significantly, the high-order terms are introduced because of the large dc-link ripple. These high-order terms are unique to the SLIC and negligible in conventional high-inertia converters. A discrete-time large-signal model is built to capture the dc-link’s nonlinear dynamics, and the eigenvalues of a small-signal Jacobian matrix are analyzed with Floquet theory to evaluate stability, using the modular soft-switching solid-state transformer (M-S4T) as an example of the SLIC. Simulation and experimental results of an MVDC M-S4T verify the analysis and the predictive control method. Finally, the general application of the predictive control to low-inertia converters is compared against a conventional PI controller using a reduced dc-link active-front-end (AFE) rectifier as an example.","IEEE","","Georgia Institute of Technology, Atlanta, GA (United States)","USDOE Office of Energy Efficiency and Renewable Energy (EERE)","","United States","2021-06-01T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: IEEE Transactions on Power Electronics; Journal Volume: 36; Journal Issue: 12","","Medium: ED; Size: p. 14295-14311","","","EE0006521","Journal ID: ISSN 0885-8993","10.1109/tpel.2021.3085679","","2022-10-26T00:00:00Z","1894262","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/1894262","https://www.osti.gov/servlets/purl/1894262","IEEE Transactions on Power Electronics","12","36"

The biggest consumer of energy in a supermarket is its refrigeration system, which accounts for 40%–60% of its total electricity usage and is equivalent to about 2%–3% of the total energy consumed by commercial buildings in the United States. Also, the supermarket refrigeration system is one of the biggest consumers of refrigerants. Reducing refrigerant usage or using environmentally friendly alternatives can result in significant climate benefits. A challenge is the lack of publicly available data sets to benchmark the system performance and record the faulted performance.

"An overview of data tools for representing and managing building information and performance data","Luo, Na; Pritoni, Marco; Hong, Tianzhen","32 ENERGY CONSERVATION, CONSUMPTION, AND UTILIZATION; building information modeling; ontology; data schema; metadata; building performance data","Building information modeling (BIM) has been widely adopted for representing and exchanging building data across disciplines during building design and construction. However, BIM's use in the building operation phase is limited. With the increasing deployment of low-cost sensors and meters, as well as affordable digital storage and computing technologies, growing volumes of data have been collected from buildings, their energy services systems, and occupants. Such data are crucial to help decision makers understand what, how, and when energy is consumed in buildings—a critical step to improving building performance for energy efficiency, demand flexibility, and resilience. However, practical analyses and use of the collected data are very limited due to various reasons, including poor data quality, ad-hoc representation of data, and lack of data science skills. To unlock value from building data, there is a strong need for a toolchain to curate and represent building information and performance data in common standardized terminologies and schemas, to enable interoperability between tools and applications. This study selected and reviewed 24 data tools based on common use cases of data across the building life cycle, from design to construction, commissioning, operation, and retrofits. The selected data tools are grouped into three categories: (1) data dictionary or terminology, (2) data ontology and schemas, and (3) data platforms. The data are grouped into ten typologies covering most types of data collected in buildings. This study resulted in five main findings: (1) most data representation tools can represent their intended data typologies well, such as Green Button for smart meter data and Brick schema for metadata of sensors in buildings and HVAC systems, but none of the tools cover all ten types of data; (2) there is a need for data schemas to represent the basis of design data and metadata of occupant data; (3) standard terminologies such as those defined in BEDES are only adopted in a few data tools; (4) integrating data across various stages in the building life cycle remains a challenge; and (5) most data tools were developed and maintained by different parties for different purposes, their flexibility and interoperability can be improved to support broader use cases.

"Hole Trapping at Acceptor Impurities and Alloying Elements in AlN","Lyons, John L.; Van de Walle, Chris G.","32 ENERGY CONSERVATION, CONSUMPTION, AND UTILIZATION; first-principles calculations; UV light emitters; aluminum nitride; doping; polarons; hole trapping; impurities; p-type doping","Hole localization is a root cause of difficulties in p-type doping of aluminum nitride. Herein, the stability of localized holes in AlN and their susceptibility to self-trapping within bulk material or in the presence of isovalent elements and acceptor impurities are calculated. It is found that self-trapped holes are metastable in bulk AlN, and also exhibit a very low barrier to detrapping. However, holes become trapped in the presence of acceptor impurities as well as isovalent elements such as B, In, and Sc, and may contribute to the broad luminescence observed in AlN alloys. It is also found that hole trapping contributes to the large ionization energies for acceptors in AlN. Most acceptors can also trap a second hole, becoming positively charged and further exacerbating difficulties in doping aluminum nitride p type. Furthermore, the stability of trapped holes is found to scale with atomic size mismatch to Al.","Wiley","","Univ. of California, Santa Barbara, CA (United States)","USDOE Office of Science (SC), Basic Energy Sciences (BES)","","United States","2021-05-22T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: Physica Status Solidi rrl; Journal Volume: 15; Journal Issue: 8","","Medium: ED; Size: Article No. 2100218","","","SC0010689","Journal ID: ISSN 1862-6254; CNS-1725797","10.1002/pssr.202100218","","2022-05-23T00:00:00Z","1837808","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/1837808","https://www.osti.gov/servlets/purl/1837808","Physica Status Solidi rrl","8","15"
"Assessment of small mechanical wastewater treatment plants: Relative life cycle environmental impacts of construction and operations","Moussavi, Sussan; Thompson, Matthew; Li, Shaobin; Dvorak, Bruce","42 ENGINEERING; 32 ENERGY CONSERVATION, CONSUMPTION, AND UTILIZATION; life cycle assessment; construction; operation; energy efficiency; design; small wastewater treatment plant","Many slow growing and shrinking rural communities struggle with aging or inadequate wastewater treatment plants (WWTPs), and face challenges in constructing and operating such facilities. Although existing literature has provided insight into the environmental sustainability of large facilities, including both the construction and operational phases, these studies have not examined small, rural facilities treating less than 7,000 m<sup>3</sup>/d (1.8 MGD) of wastewater in adequate depth and breadth. In this study, a detailed inventory of the construction and operational data for 16 case studies of small WWTPs was developed to elucidate their environmental life cycle impacts. Conventional LCA framework was followed. The results show that the environmental impacts of both the construction and operational phases are considerable. Operational impacts are highly related to energy usage. Improving energy efficiency of a plant may reduce the environmental impacts related to operations. Construction impacts can vary considerably between facilities. Process-related factors (e.g., concrete and reinforcing steel used in basins) are typically sized using the design flow; thus much of the variability in construction impacts among plants stems from the non-process related infrastructure. Multiple regression analysis was used as an exploratory tool to identify which non-process related plant aspects contribute to the variable environmental impact of small WWTPs. These factors include aluminum, cast iron, and the capacity utilization ratio (defined as the ratio of average flow to design flow). Furthermore, industry practitioners should consider these factors when aiming to reduce the environmental impacts of a small WWTP related to construction. Scenario sensitivity analyses found that the environmental impact of construction became smaller with longer design life, and the end-of-life consideration does not heavily influence the environmental sustainability of a WWTP.","Elsevier","","Univ. of Nebraska, Lincoln, NE (United States)","USDOE Office of Energy Efficiency and Renewable Energy (EERE), Energy Efficiency Office.

Time-resolved measurements are performed using a near-infrared pump pulse, with photon energies near to and above the band gap, probed with a terahertz probe pulse. The transient terahertz absorption is characterized by a multi-rise, multi-decay function that captures long-lived decay times and a metastable state for an excess-photon energy of >100 meV. For sufficient excess-photon energy, excitation of the metastable state is followed by a transition to the long-lived states. Excitation dependence of the long-lived states map onto a nearly-direct band gap (E<sub>g</sub>) density of states with an Urbach tail below E<sub>g</sub>. As temperature increases, the long-lived decay times increase < E<sub>g</sub>, due to the increased phonon interaction of the unintentional defect states, and by phonon stabilization of the hot carriers > E<sub>g</sub>. Additionally, Auger (and/or trap-assisted Auger) scattering above the onset of the plateau may also contribute to longer hot-carrier lifetimes. Meanwhile, the initial decay component shows strong dependence on excitation energy and temperature, reflecting the complicated initial transfer of energy between valence-band and defect states, indicating methods to further prolong hot carriers for technological applications.","Nature Publishing Group","","Univ. of Oklahoma, Norman, OK (United States)","USDOE Office of Energy Efficiency and Renewable Energy (EERE); USDOE Office of Science (SC), Basic Energy Sciences (BES).

This study uses 10-year measured hourly weather data at 27 sites in San Francisco, California, to (1) analyze and visualize the urban microclimate patterns and urban heat island effect; (2) simulate annual energy use and peak electricity demand of typical large office buildings and large hotels to investigate the influence of urban microclimate on building performance; (3) simulate indoor air temperature of a single-family house without air-conditioning during the record three-day heatwave of 2017, to quantify the divergence of climate resilience due to urban microclimate effect. Results show significant microclimate effects in San Francisco with up to 11 °C outdoor air temperature difference between the coastal and downtown areas on September 1, 2017, during the record three-day heatwave. The simulated energy results of the prototype large office and large hotel buildings using the 2017 weather data show over 100% difference in annual heating energy use and 65% difference in annual cooling energy use across different stations; as well as up to 30% difference in peak cooling electricity demand. The impacts on annual site or source energy use are minimal (less than 5%) as cooling and heating in a mild climate are a relatively small portion of overall building energy use in San Francisco. Results also show the microclimate effects influence indoor air temperature of unconditioned homes by up to 5 °C. Newer buildings and homes are much less affected by microclimate effects due to more stringent performance requirements of the building envelope and energy systems. Furthermore, these findings inform that San Francisco microclimate variations should be considered in urban energy planning, building energy codes and standards, as well as heat resilience policymaking.","Elsevier","","Lawrence Berkeley National Lab.

Additionally, it has been widely applied to solve problems of building technologies, such as building load estimation, control and optimization, and building-grid integration. However, a thorough review of grey-box modeling is not available. This review study systematically investigated various aspects of grey-box modeling for buildings. First, the fundamental aspects of grey-box modeling are presented, including the theoretical background, modeling of building elements, modeling order, modeling diagram, and order reduction. Second, the detailed modeling approaches are discussed. Third, multiple applications of grey-box modeling are investigated for building energy domain, which are categorized into the following groups: heat dynamics analysis, thermal load estimation, building control and optimization, district/urban scale energy modeling, and building-grid integration. Finally, the available software packages for grey-box modeling are compared. Overall, the challenges of using grey-box modeling can be summarized as follows: (1) the theoretical limitations and assumptions of grey-box modeling are unclear; (2) grey-box model naming convention and structure are confusing; (3) grey-box model creation is vague; (4) suitable applications of grey-box models are unknown; and (5) grey-box models lack unified software solutions for wider adoption.","Elsevier","","Oak Ridge National Lab.

In this study, we compare the well-to-wheels (WTW) greenhouse gas (GHG) emission intensities of PEVs with those of gasoline vehicles at the provincial level in the year 2017 by considering the heterogeneity in the consumption-based electricity mix and climate impacts on vehicle fuel economy. Results show a high variation of provincial WTW GHG emission intensities for battery electric vehicles (BEVs, 22–293 g CO<sub>2</sub>eq/km) and plug-in hybrid electric vehicles (PHEVs, 82–298 g CO<sub>2</sub>eq/km) in contrast to gasoline internal combustion engine vehicles (ICEVs, 227–245 g CO<sub>2</sub>eq/km) and gasoline hybrid electric vehicles (HEVs, 141–164 g CO<sub>2</sub>eq/km). Due to the GHG-intensive coal-based electricity and cold weather, WTW GHG emission intensities of BEVs and PHEVs are higher than those of gasoline ICEVs in seven and ten northern provinces in China, respectively. WTW GHG emission intensities of gasoline HEVs, on the other hand, are lower in 18 and 26 provinces than those of BEVs and PHEVs, respectively. The analysis suggests that province-specific PEV and electric grid development policies should be considered for GHG emission reductions of on-road transportation in China.","American Chemical Society","","Argonne National Lab.

"Modelica-based system modeling for studying control-related faults in chiller plants and boiler plants serving large office buildings","Huang, Sen; Zuo, Wangda; Vrabie, Draguna; Xu, Rong","32 ENERGY CONSERVATION, CONSUMPTION, AND UTILIZATION; boiler plant; chiller plant; fault modeling; impact analysis; Modelica","Dynamic modelling of the faulty operation of chiller plants and boiler plants can help identify their impacts and support the development of fault detection methods. However, adequate models are seldom reported in the literature. In this study, we aim to develop high-fidelity models for approximating the dynamic behaviors of chiller plants and boiler plants under control-related faults. Specifically, we first designed a typical configuration of the chiller plants and the boiler plants; we then modeled both the physical systems and controllers of these typical plants with Modelica. When developing the Modelica models, we created a hierarchical model structure while modules in each layer can be redeclared and parameterized at upper layers. This model structure facilitates the implementation of fault scenarios through intuitive model modifiers. At last, we applied the proposed models in a comprehensive fault impact evaluation of the thirteen control-related faults of chiller and boiler plants. In this evaluation, the proposed models are coupled with the EnergyPlusTM thermal load model to study the impact of various faulty scenarios. Based on the fault impact evaluation results, we identified the faults that have the most significant impacts on the operation of the chiller and boiler plants, respectively. We also found that the relationship between the impacts of the studied faults and the severity level of the faults can be highly non-linear. This study contributes to the literature by providing the first dynamic models of chiller plants and boiler plants which can be used to study control-related faults on a large-scale.","Elsevier","","National Renewable Energy Lab.

"Decarbonization of Residential Building Energy Supply: Impact of Cogeneration System Performance on Energy, Environment, and Economics","Cheekatamarla, Praveen K.","32 ENERGY CONSERVATION, CONSUMPTION, AND UTILIZATION","Electrical and thermal loads of residential buildings present a unique opportunity for onsite power generation, and concomitant thermal energy generation, storage, and utilization, to decrease primary energy consumption and carbon dioxide intensity. This approach also improves resiliency and ability to address peak load burden effectively. Demand response programs and grid-interactive buildings are also essential to meet the energy needs of the 21st century while addressing climate impact. Given the significance of the scale of building energy consumption, this study investigates how cogeneration systems influence the primary energy consumption and carbon footprint in residential buildings. The impact of onsite power generation capacity, its electrical and thermal efficiency, and its cost, on total primary energy consumption, equivalent carbon dioxide emissions, operating expenditure, and, most importantly, thermal and electrical energy balance, is presented. The conditions at which a cogeneration approach loses its advantage as an energy efficient residential resource are identified as a function of electrical grid’s carbon footprint and primary energy efficiency. Compared to a heat pump heating system with a coefficient of performance (COP) of three, a 0.5 kW cogeneration system with 40% electrical efficiency is shown to lose its environmental benefit if the electrical grid’s carbon dioxide intensity falls below 0.4 kg CO<sub>2</sub> per kWh electricity.","MDPI AG","","Oak Ridge National Lab.

An integrated decision-making framework for dispatching and charging has been proposed using system optimization approaches. An agent-based platform has been developed for simulating and testing the proposed methods. A case study using New York City taxi data has been performed with different fleet sizes, dispatching strategies, and charging networks. Advantages of optimization-based approaches for AEV fleet management have been studied and demonstrated, for example, for a fleet of 1,750 AEVs to meet 100,000 daily requests, optimization-based centralized fleet management would result in 14% more ride requests satisfied and 43% fewer zero-occupancy miles traveled than if AEVs make independent decisions based on heuristic strategy. Benefits on reducing fleet size and charging downtime from optimization approaches are also comprehensively illustrated.","Elsevier","","Idaho National Lab.

"Active learning strategy for high fidelity short-term data-driven building energy forecasting","Zhang, Liang; Wen, Jin","32 ENERGY CONSERVATION, CONSUMPTION, AND UTILIZATION; active learning; building energy forecasting; building operation control; buildings; expected error reduction; model predictive control; training data quality","The quality of a data-driven model is heavily dependent on the quality of data. Data from building operation often have data bias problems, which means that the data sample is collected in a way that some members of the intended data population are less likely to be included than others. Data-driven energy forecasting models built on such data hence are biased and could lead to large forecasting errors. Active learning—an effective method to defying data bias—is rarely studied or applied in the area of data-driven building energy forecasting modeling. This paper attempts to fill this gap and explores the application of active learning in data-driven building energy forecasting. The developed strategy in this paper efficiently generate informative training data within a time budget and uses block design to passively consider weather disturbances. The developed active learning strategy is applied and evaluated in both virtual and real-building testbeds against traditional data-driven methods. Via these virtual and real-building evaluation cases, we have demonstrated that the data bias problem typically exists in building operation data is resolved by applying the developed active learning strategy. Furthermore, building energy forecasting models trained from data generated from the active learning strategy have shown improved performances in both model accuracy and model extendibility perspectives.

"Energy-saving potential evaluation for primary schools with occupant-centric controls","Ye, Yunyang; Chen, Yan; Zhang, Jian; Pang, Zhihong; O’Neill, Zheng; Dong, Bing; Cheng, Hwakong","32 ENERGY CONSERVATION, CONSUMPTION, AND UTILIZATION; Demand control ventilation; Occupant-based control; Primary school; Energy saving: EnergyPlus","Recent studies demonstrated that there is significant energy-saving potential for primary schools, which heating, ventilation, and air-conditioning (HVAC) systems with occupant-centric control (OCC) is an excellent candidate to save energy. However, such an energy impact has yet to be evaluated for different climate zones as well as different energy code versions, but is critical for technology transfer and deployment. Therefore, this paper conducts comprehensive evaluation on the energy-saving potentials for the primary schools with two advanced OCC strategies: presence-based and counting-based. In this work, ninety-six building energy models with stochastic behavior of occupants are developed and simulated, which consist of two building energy code versions, 16 climate zones, and baseline case (without OCC) and two advanced cases (with OCC). To evaluate the energy saving potentials for OCC, primary schools in the U.S. are used as an example. The results show that there is significant energy-saving potential for primary schools by considering OCC strategies, especially the counting-based case. The energy-saving potential is up to 10.2% for presence-based OCC and 12.41% for counting-based OCC. Furthermore, both climate and code version have a significant impact on energy savings from OCC strategies. The energy-saving potentials vary from 1.79% to 12.41% for different climates and code versions. This evaluation can also contribute to quantify the nationwide energy saving potential for other countries.","Elsevier","","Pacific Northwest National Lab.

"Lean-Stratified Combustion System with Miller Cycle for Downsized Boosted Application - Part 2","Battiston, Paul; Wheeler, Jennifer; Solomon, Arun; Sczomak, David","32 ENERGY CONSERVATION, CONSUMPTION, AND UTILIZATION; 33 ADVANCED PROPULSION SYSTEMS","Automotive manufacturers relentlessly explore engine technology combinations to achieve reduced fuel consumption under continued regulatory, societal and economic pressures. For example, technologies enabling advanced combustion modes, increased expansion to effective compression ratio and reduced parasitics continue to be developed and integrated within conventional and hybrid propulsion strategies across the industry. Here, a high-efficiency gasoline engine capable for use in conventional or hybrid electric vehicle platforms is highly desirable. This paper is the second of two papers describing the multi-cylinder integration of a technology package combining lean-stratified combustion with Miller cycle for downsized boosted applications. The first paper describes the design, analysis and single-cylinder testing conducted to down-select the combustion system deployed to the multi-cylinder engine. This paper defines a light-duty engine package capable of achieving a 35% fuel economy improvement at US Tier 3 emission standards over a naturally aspirated stoichiometric baseline vehicle. A multi-mode combustion system was developed enabling highly efficient lean-stratified operation at light-load and stoichiometric Miller-cycle operation at mid- to high-loads. A central direct-injection four-valve layout was designed with high-tumble ports and a bowl-in-piston capable of stable operation under highly dilute mixtures when properly matched to fuel spray characteristics, injection strategy, and a high-energy ignition system. Boost system layout and base engine architecture were selected to minimize parasitics and maximize after treatment effectiveness. A multi-cylinder engine was developed and calibrated over a steady-state map. Results fed vehicle simulations over the EPA city and highway test cycles to predict the fuel economy improvement and tailpipe emissions potential. Fuel economy improvements over the baseline vehicle were projected at 42% and 39% for active-urea and passive-ammonia SCR after treatment systems respectively. Controls complexity to achieve regulatory compliance and the cost of the lean after treatment system were identified as the primary challenges to commercial viability.","SAE International","","General Motors LLC, Detroit, MI (United States)","USDOE Office of Energy Efficiency and Renewable Energy (EERE), Transportation Office.

"Institutional heat wave analysis by building energy modeling fleet and meter data","Villa, Daniel L.","32 ENERGY CONSERVATION, CONSUMPTION, AND UTILIZATION; Building energy modeling; Heat waves; Institutional analyses; Electricity consumption; Peak load","Heat waves increase electric demand from buildings which can cause power outages. Modeling can help planners quantify the risk of such events. This study shows how Building Energy Modeling (BEM), meter data, and climate projections can estimate heat wave effect on energy consumption and electric peak load. The methodology assumes that a partial representation of BEM for an entire site of buildings is sufficient to represent the entire site. Two linear regression models of the BEM results are produced: 1) Energy use as a function of heat wave heat content and 2) Peak load as a function of maximum daily temperature. The uncertainty conveyed in meter data is applied to these regressions providing slope and intercept 95% confidence intervals. The methodology was applied using 97 detailed BEM, site weather data, 242 building meters, and NEX-DCP30 down-scaled climate data for an entire institution in Albuquerque, New Mexico. A series of heat waves that vary from 2019 weather to a peak increase of 5.9 °C was derived. The results of the study provided institutional planners with information needed for a site that is presently growing very rapidly. The resulting regression models are also useful for resilience analyses involving probabilistic risk assessments.","Elsevier","","Sandia National Lab.

Passive TES is usually implemented in building envelope as micro and macro encapsulated phase change materials (PCM) to shift electric energy demand and therefore requires careful heat transfer analysis. Whole building energy modelling with simplified heat transfer analysis has become extremely important for designers, architects, engineers, and researchers to predict energy performance of buildings. It is important to validate PCM modelling algorithms used in building energy programs to quantify their error and prove their capacity to model different PCM encapsulation types. This study uses data from a microencapsulated PCM and two macroencapsulated PCMs (Bio based PCM and hydrate salts) tested in full-scale using the Advanced Multiscale Building Energy Research (AMBER) Lab located at the Colorado School of Mines and is used to validate a numerical algorithm written in MATLAB language. To approximate the heat transfer through a wall assembly with macroencapsulated PCM pouches, several modelling techniques that can reduce 3D heat transfer characteristics to 1D are explored in this research. A parallel path heat transfer modelling approach is found to give the closest agreement with the experimental data for the pouched PCMs in building envelope applications.","Elsevier","","National Renewable Energy Lab.

Renewable DGs are of particular interest to utility companies, but the stochastic nature of intermittent renewable DGs could have a negative impact on the electric grid if they are not properly handled. In this study, we investigate distribution system service restoration using DGs as the primary power source, and we develop an effective approach to handle the uncertainty of renewable DGs under extreme conditions. The distribution system service restoration problem can be described as a mixed-integer second-order cone programming model by modifying the radial topology constraints and power flow equations. The uncertainty of renewable DGs will be modeled using a chance-constrained approach. Furthermore, the forecast errors and noises in real-time operation are solved using a novel model-free control algorithm that can automatically track the trajectory of real-time DG output. The proposed service restoration strategy and model-free control algorithm are validated using an IEEE 123-bus test system.","Elsevier","","National Renewable Energy Lab.

However, the range of electric vehicles decreases in cold climates partly because of the additional thermal loads associated with cabin heating. One way to improve the efficiency of cabin heating is to replace resistive heating elements with an air-source heat pump system. However, to gain the full benefit of heat pumping, frost formation on the outdoor heat exchanger must be minimized. In this work, we modified the surface wettability of aluminum louvered-fin automotive heat pump evaporators and tested them under realistic operating conditions in a transcritical carbon dioxide (CO<sub>2</sub>) heat pump. Each heat exchanger underwent several consecutive frosting and defrosting cycles to understand the cyclic performance of the system. The heat exchanger with a superhydrophobic outer surface was able to delay frost formation and maintain higher heat transfer rates when compared to heat exchangers with higher surface energies (hydrophilic). The delayed frost formation resulted in a system efficiency benefit in the first few frosting cycles but diminished in later cycles due to water retention and incomplete defrosting. However, for most automotive applications the superhydrophobic heat exchanger showed substantial benefits for normal driving trips. We report the scalable and optimized superhydrophobic heat exchangers developed here have the potential to increase the efficiency of automotive heat pumps and consequently increase the range and reduce energy consumption of electric vehicles.","Elsevier","","National Renewable Energy Lab.

In order to achieve these goals, reducing emissions from existing buildings is crucial. Many cities are passing legislation to target existing buildings through benchmarking, auditing, retuning, or energy or emissions performance standards. As cities design legislation, they must consider the timing of the policies, how to prioritize building types and sizes, and how these design decisions will impact the city’s emissions. This paper addresses these questions for one particular US city: Seattle, Washington. A model of Seattle’s building stock was created with benchmarking and tax assessor data. It was then used to predict GHG emissions reductions due to different policy implementations for existing commercial and multifamily buildings. Key findings are: (1) the proposed emissions policy is expected to reduce cumulative emissions from buildings by 19% between 2020 and 2050; (2) delaying the implementation of the policy by five years could limit savings to 12%; and (3) including smaller buildings in the policy could increase savings to 34%. The lessons learned and how this can be used by other cities are discussed.","Ubiquity Press","","Lawrence Berkeley National Lab.

In this paper, we present a detailed system-level modeling for thermoelectric air conditioning system with position-dependent (graded) and constant material properties. Strategies for design optimization of the system are provided in terms of cost-performance trade-off. Realistic convection heat transfer at both sides of the system are taken into account in our modeling. Here, the effects of convection heat transfer coefficients, air flowrate, and thermoelectric material properties are investigated with varying key parameters such as TE leg thickness, module fill factor, and input current. Both constant material properties and graded properties are considered for the TE materials, and they are compared in terms of the degree of cooling, coefficient of performance (COP), and power consumption. For graded materials, we employ one-dimensional finite element methods to solve the coupled electrical and thermal current equations with arbitrary profile of material properties varying with position along the TE legs. We find that graded materials can enhance the degree of cooling, but only at the expense of COP, compared to the case of constant property materials. With constant material properties of ZT = 1 and relatively low electric current, the power consumption of TE coolers can be lower than those of conventional air conditioners at an equivalent cooling capacity. Considering additional advantages such as demand-flexible operation, low noise, and high scalability, thermoelectric cooling could be a competitive technology for future air conditioning applications.","Elsevier","","Univ. of Cincinnati, OH (United States)","USDOE Office of Science (SC), Basic Energy Sciences (BES); National Science Foundation (NSF)","","United States","2021-03-19T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: Energy and Buildings; Journal Volume: 240","","Medium: ED; Size: Article No. 110931","","","SC0020154; DMR-1905571","Journal ID: ISSN 0378-7788","10.1016/j.enbuild.2021.110931","","2022-03-21T00:00:00Z","1784551","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/1784551","https://www.osti.gov/servlets/purl/1784551","Energy and Buildings","","240"

We survey the literature to assess the current state of reuse and its motives and barriers in the United States, before synthesizing information from publicly available EPA data on contaminants in US manufacturing wastewaters and technologies for treating them. Using the available data, we derive a set of “ubiquitous contaminants” among the top ten in terms of mass discharged in more than half of US manufacturing subsectors (NAICS 31–33) according to EPA permit data. We also present information on proven treatment trains and their energy requirements. We then compare water quality requirements for specific contaminants in reclaimed water to those characteristic of wastewater streams currently being discharged from manufacturing plants into surface waters to highlight sectors with reuse opportunities that could require little cost to realize, such as primary metals and, to a lesser extent, petroleum and coal products. We conclude by highlighting data limitations that need to be rectified before applying the framework more broadly and discussing how these data gaps could be filled. Better understanding the relationship between energy and water in the context of on-site manufacturing water reuse would allow manufacturers to improve resiliency by reducing regulatory, physical, and reputational risks while lessening their footprint on local watersheds.","Wiley - Yale University","","Lawrence Berkeley National Lab.

Few studies have explored the potential benefits of utilizing cool coatings on building envelopes (“cool-coated buildings”) based on life-cycle cost analysis. A holistic approach integrating the field testing, building energy simulation, and a 20-year life-cycle-based optimization was developed to explore cool-coated building performance and the maximum net savings of optimal building envelope retrofit and design. Experimental results showed that applying cool coatings to a west wall of an office building in Chongqing, China reduced its exterior surface temperature by up to 9.3 °C in summer. Additionally, simulation results showed that in Chongqing, making the roof and walls cool could reduce annual HVAC electricity use by up to 11.9% in old buildings (with poorly insulated envelopes) and up to 5.9% in new buildings. Retrofitting old buildings with a cool roof provided the net savings per modified area with present values up to 42.8 CNY/m2; retrofitting a new building with a cool roof or cool walls was not cost-effective. Optimizing both envelope insulation and envelope albedo can achieve 5.6 times the net savings of optimizing the insulation only, and 1.6 times that of optimizing albedo only.","Elsevier","","Lawrence Berkeley National Lab.

To understand the impact, this work simulates two EV charging scenarios (home- and work-dominant) under potential 2030 EV adoption levels on 10 actual distribution feeders that support residential, commercial, and industrial loads. The simulations include actual driving patterns of existing (non-EV) vehicles taken from global positioning system (GPS) data. The GPS driving behaviors, which explain the spatial and temporal EV charging demands, provide information on each vehicles travel distance, dwell locations, and dwell durations. Then, the EPS simulations incorporate the EV charging demands to calculate the power flow across the feeder. Simulation results show that voltage impacts are modest (less than 0.01 p.u.), likely due to robust feeder designs and the models only represent the high-voltage (“primary”) system components.

The research was conducted by collecting and analysing real time current draw data on air compressors and associated dryers at eight different facilities (13 air compressors) in terms of energy, power and cost. A decision tool was developed to depict the operational characteristics (power, energy and cost) of each type of dryer if used in conjunction with the selected compressor system. Finally, this research, on an equivalent normalised basis, compared and contrasted the different types of dryers in terms of performance and cost. Here, the research concluded that of the five types of desiccant dryer types observed the most energy efficient was the BHNP (with cooling water pump), subject to the operational conditions.","Inderscience Publishers","","West Virginia Univ., Morgantown, WV (United States)","USDOE Office of Energy Efficiency and Renewable Energy (EERE), Energy Efficiency Office.

However, the existing Si-based solutions cannot fulfill the requirements of a high-efficiency and robust converter for MVDC grids. This paper presents a 5 kV SiC-based universal modular solid-state transformer (SST). This universal current-source SST can interface either a LVAC or LVDC grid with a MVDC grid in single-stage power conversion, while the conventional dual active bridge (DAB) converter needs an additional inverter. The proposed SST module using 3.3 kV SiC MOSFETs and diodes is bidirectional and can serve as a building block in series or parallel for higher-voltage higher-power systems. The topology of each module is based on the soft-switching solid-state transformer (S4T) with reduced conduction loss, which features reduced EMI through controlled dv/dt, and high efficiency with full-range ZVS for main devices and ZCS for auxiliary devices. Operation principle of the modular S4T (M-S4T), capacitor voltage balancing control between the cascaded modules, design of components including a medium-voltage (MV) medium-frequency transformer (MFT) to realize a 50 kVA 5 kV DC to 600 V DC or 480 V AC M-S4T are presented. Importantly, the MV MFT prototype achieves very low leakage inductance (0.13%) and 15 kV insulation with coaxial cables and nanocrystalline cores. Here, the proposed universal modular SST is compared against the DAB solution and verified with DC-DC and DC-AC simulation and 4 kV experimental results. Significantly, the MV experimental results of a modular DC transformer with each module at MVDC are rarely covered in the literature and reported for the first time.","IEEE","","Georgia Institute of Technology, Atlanta, GA (United States)","USDOE Office of Energy Efficiency and Renewable Energy (EERE)","","United States","2021-03-17T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: IEEE Transactions on Power Electronics; Journal Volume: 36; Journal Issue: 10","","Medium: ED; Size: p. 11326-11343","","","EE0006521","Journal ID: ISSN 0885-8993","10.1109/tpel.2021.3066908","","2022-10-26T00:00:00Z","1894263","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/1894263","https://www.osti.gov/servlets/purl/1894263","IEEE Transactions on Power Electronics","10","36"

In recent years there has been growing interest in understanding how to evaluate, measure, and improve building energy resilience, i.e., the ability of a building to provide energy-related services in the event of a local or regional power outage. In addition to human health and safety, many stakeholders are keenly interested in the ability of a building to allow continuity of operations and minimize business disruption. Office buildings are subject to significant economic losses when building operations are disrupted due to a power outage. We propose “occupant hours lost” (OHL) as a means to measure the business productivity lost as the result of a power outage in office buildings. OHL is determined based on indoor conditions in each space for each hour during a power outage, and then aggregated spatially and temporally to determine the whole building OHL. We used quasi-Monte Carlo parametric energy simulations to demonstrate how the OHL metric varies due to different building characteristics across different climate zones and seasons. The simulation dataset was then used to develop simple regression models for assessing the impact of ten key building characteristics on OHL. The most impactful were window-to-wall ratio and window characteristics. The regression models show promise as a simple means to assess and screen for resilience using basic building characteristics, especially for non-critical facilities where it may not be viable to conduct detailed engineering analysis.</p>","MDPI AG","","Lawrence Berkeley National Lab.

"A simulation-based assessment of technologies to reduce heat emissions from buildings","Ferrando, Martina; Hong, Tianzhen; Causone, Francesco","32 ENERGY CONSERVATION, CONSUMPTION, AND UTILIZATION; Heat emissions; Building performance simulation; Urban overheating; Anthropogenic heat","Heat emissions from buildings are part of anthropogenic heat leading to urban overheating. This paper aims to assess how technologies (i.e., energy conservation measures - ECMs), used to decrease energy use, may also reduce heat emissions from buildings. This study employs the physics-based engine EnergyPlus to simulate the main components of heat emissions from buildings to ambient air: envelope, zone, and systems. Hourly simulations are run for IECC single- and multi-family reference models with three representative climates: Miami, Baltimore, and Chicago. The results show that the performance of ECMs varies among weather, seasons, and residential typologies. Particularly, some ECMs (i.e., cool coatings, heat pumps, additional insulation, energy-awareness occupants) show a strong decrease in heat emissions, yet they are not always correlated with proportional decreases in energy use. When all ECMs are combined, the reductions are larger on heat emissions (89%) than on site energy (65%) from the base cases. During summer in Miami, the combination of ECMs shows a decrease in heat emissions from the building surface component of 80% during daytime, 92% for the HVAC component and a counterbalanced increase in the zone component of 88%, bringing to a daily decrease in total heat emissions. The main contributions of this study are quantifying how typical ECMs influence residential building heat emissions using EnergyPlus simulations and informing urban planners and stakeholders on prioritizing measures for mitigating urban overheating problems.","Elsevier","","Lawrence Berkeley National Lab.

"Cost optimization of multi-stage gap membrane distillation","Dudchenko, Alexander V.; Bartholomew, Timothy V.; Mauter, Meagan S.","32 ENERGY CONSERVATION, CONSUMPTION, AND UTILIZATION; membrane distillation; multi-stage; techno-economic analysis; cost optimization; process design and operation","Estimating the costs and performance of emerging separation technologies is technically challenging because of the complex design space and the interdependence between system and module-level design decisions. This work develops a process-based cost-optimization model that minimizes the levelized cost of water (LCOW) produced using multi-stage gap MD. The model fully captures solution properties, heat transport, and mass transport relationships within each membrane module, specifies the optimal multi-stage configuration of modules in series, and determines cost-optimal operation of each stage and the system as a whole as a function of gap type, the number of stages, feed conditions, and desired water recovery. We estimate that the LCOW for recovering 50% of a 100 g/L feed using conductive gap multi-stage MD is approximately 6.5 $ per m<sup>3</sup> of product water. Cost-optimal designs of multi-stage systems balance operational costs (primarily energy) and capital costs (primarily membrane). This balance results in stages having a different design and operation across the system (e.g. initial stages operating with chilling and heating and end stages using only heating). Sensitivity analysis on the model results suggests that improving membrane parameters and module designs may provide modest cost reductions of <15%.","Elsevier","","National Energy Technology Laboratory (NETL), Pittsburgh, PA, Morgantown, WV, and Albany, OR (United States); SLAC National Accelerator Lab., Menlo Park, CA (United States)","USDOE Office of Energy Efficiency and Renewable Energy (EERE), Energy Efficiency Office.

This trend is most apparent in North America, but it is also occurring in Japan and Europe. However, the contribution of MELs to building energy use is not currently well understood, both because the products in this category are transforming rapidly and the definition and classification of MELs is ambiguous. Furthermore, this study estimated the national energy consumption of 36 MELs using best-available data and found them to comprise 12% of delivered electricity to the U.S. residential and commercial building sectors. If 26 of these MELs were replaced with the most energy-efficient product models available on the market, their energy consumption could be halved to 6% of delivered electricity. National energy models will better account for building energy consumption by incorporating the MELs data collected and analyzed for this study, leading to improved policy decisions.","Elsevier","","Lawrence Berkeley National Lab.

Since both surrogate components are involved in the key reactions controlling the autoignition reactivity of diesel surrogates, autoignition studies of iso-cetane, tetralin, and their blending behavior at low temperatures can be helpful in developing/refining chemical kinetic models of diesel surrogates, in order to better predict diesel ignition response under low temperature combustion conditions. In this investigation, autoignition experiments of iso-cetane, tetralin, and their binary mixtures at varying blending ratios have been conducted in a rapid compression machine (RCM) in the temperature/pressure range of 630–930 K and 10–20 bar. For the neat fuel components, the newly-acquired RCM data have been compared with the literature experimental results at some overlapping conditions. In addition, a chemical kinetic model describing the oxidation of iso-cetane and tetralin compiled/updated from the diesel surrogate model developed by Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory is used to simulate the experimental datasets. It is shown that this model exhibits good agreement with the experimental results of tetralin and also predicts the total ignition delay times of iso-cetane at lower temperatures reasonably well. However, the current model fails to fully capture the increase of total ignition delay time with increasing amount of tetralin in the binary blends observed in the present RCM experiments. Therefore, chemical kinetic analyses of the current model are conducted to help identify possible reasons leading to the discrepancies between simulations and experiments. Furthermore, the chemical kinetic interactions between iso-cetane and tetralin are explored by including additional cross-reactions among iso-cetane, tetralin, and their fuel fragments in the current model to assess their effects on model predictions. As a result, based on the chemical kinetic analysis results, future direction for model refinements is discussed.","Elsevier","External Audience (Unlimited)","Lawrence Livermore National Lab.

In order to provide a defined guideline for projects with assumed common baseline characteristics, this paper applies a sensitivity analysis method to evaluate the impact of individual EEMs and groups these into packages to produce deep energy savings for a sample prototype medium office building across 15 climate zones in the United States. We start with one baseline model for each climate zone and nine candidate EEMs with a range of efficiency levels for each EEM. Three energy performance indicators (EPIs) are defined, which are annual electricity use intensity, annual natural gas use intensity, and annual energy cost. Then, a Standard Regression Coefficient (SRC) sensitivity analysis method is applied to determine the sensitivity of each EEM with respect to the three EPIs, and the relative sensitivity of all EEMs are calculated to evaluate their energy impacts. For the selected range of efficiency levels, the results indicate that the EEMs with higher energy impacts (i.e., higher sensitivity) in most climate zones are high-performance windows, reduced interior lighting power, and reduced interior plug and process loads. However, the sensitivity of the EEMs also vary by climate zone and EPI; for example, improved opaque envelope insulation and efficiency of cooling and heating systems are found to have a high energy impact in cold and hot climates.","Springer","","National Renewable Energy Lab.

Traditionally, most studies utilize airport weather information as the decision inputs. However, most buildings are in environments that are quite different than those at the airport miles away. Tree cover, adjacent buildings, and micro-climate effects caused by the larger surrounding area can all yield deviations in air temperature, humidity, solar irradiance, and wind that are large enough to influence design and operation decisions. In order to overcome this challenge, there are many prior studies on developing weather forecasting algorithms from micro-to meso-scales. Additionally, this paper reviews and complies knowledge on common weather data resources, data processing methodologies and forecasting techniques of weather information. Commonly used statistical, machine learning and physical-based models are discussed and presented as two major categories: deterministic forecasting and probabilistic forecasting.

"Operating Hardware Impact on the Heat Transfer Properties of Windows","Misiopecki, Cezary; Hart, Robert; Gustavsen, Arild; Jelle, Bjørn Petter (ORCID:0000000320266394)","32 ENERGY CONSERVATION, CONSUMPTION, AND UTILIZATION; window; operating hardware; energy; thermal bridge; U-value","Despite significant advancements in fenestration technology in the last two decades, the thermal transmittance of fenestration products is still significantly higher than that of walls. This corresponds to 60% of the total energy loss of a modern building envelope through the windows. Hence, further development and improvements of fenestration products are necessary. Increasingly stringent codes and standards for fenestration stimulate industry to work on improved solutions. Thus, it is crucial that assessment techniques are able to account for innovations accurately. The thermal effects of non-continuous hardware in window frames are currently ignored by international rating procedures. A preliminary investigation conducted by our team showed significant performance degradation in two of the three out-opening casement profiles caused by the presence of operating hardware. Frames with the structure made of vinyl and fiberglass consist of many air cavities that are penetrated by operating hardware made of highly conductive materials. In these frames, in order to have an accurate assessment, it may be required to employ three-dimensional modeling due to the convective nature of heat transfer within the cavities. However, in this study, we demonstrate that the three-dimensional (3D) effects of non-continuous hardware can be approximated accurately with simpler two-dimensional (2D) simulations. We then develop a simplified model based on weighted average capable of replacing the time- and computation-intensive 3D simulations with 2D simulations and validate it against market available frames and their corresponding hardware. Validation results show that our approximation technique results in discrepancies lower than 0.05 W/(m<sup>2</sup>K), or 3% of the total thermal transmittance. Thus, we conclude that simplified 2D simulation models may be used for predicting hardware impact in window frames with reasonable accuracy. As windows and glazing structures are becoming ever better thermally insulated, it is becoming even more important to be able to model the impact of the operating hardware on the total thermal performance in order to design the best windows possible and not let the operating hardware ruin an otherwise well-proven design, which is hence addressed in this study.","MDPI AG","","Lawrence Berkeley National Lab.

"Separate sensible and latent cooling: Carnot limits and system taxonomy","Gluesenkamp, Kyle R.; Nawaz, Kashif","32 ENERGY CONSERVATION, CONSUMPTION, AND UTILIZATION; Separate sensible latent cooling; Hybrid cooling; SSLC; Desiccant; Sensible heat ratio; Carnot efficiency","Energy efficiency and thermal comfort can be improved by independent control of temperature and humidity. In recent work, an emerging class of cooling systems known as separate sensible and latent cooling (SSLC) systems have demonstrated 14 to 47% energy savings, while simultaneously providing better comfort control than conventional air conditioning. In this work, SSLC is defined as using two or more cooling processes with unequal sensible heat ratio (SHR) to control temperature and humidity independently and dynamically. Fundamental efficiency limits of SSLC systems are developed for the first time, demonstrating that the Carnot efficiency for SSLC is higher than that of conventional systems. It is revealed that SSLC has particularly high potential for moderate outdoor temperatures, high sensible building loads, and drier indoor conditions. Additionally, this work proposes a classification scheme for SSLC systems, revealing an enormous number of feasible cycle permutations. This provides a framework for the important research task of developing SSLC systems that will save energy, be practical to construct, and be controllable.","Elsevier","","Oak Ridge National Lab.

"A framework for estimating the energy-saving potential of occupant behaviour improvement","He, Zhiyuan; Hong, Tianzhen; Chou, S. K.","32 ENERGY CONSERVATION, CONSUMPTION, AND UTILIZATION; Occupant behaviour; Energy-saving potential; Implementation difficulty; Tropical region; Building performance simulation","Energy-related occupant behaviour in buildings has demonstrated considerable energy-saving potential. However, the current modelling method of occupant behaviour does not give sufficient considerations on the implementation difficulty of behaviour and provide a holistic map from survey data to various behaviour models. This article proposes a holistic survey-and-simulation-based framework for estimating the energy-saving potential of occupant behaviour improvement. In the framework, seven typical categories of occupant behaviour models are identified based on the survey results. According to the implementation difficulty, the models are integrated into four behaviour styles (baseline, wasteful, moderate and austere) to represent different levels of energy-saving consciousness of occupants. Based on a case study with a nationwide survey in Singapore, there are remarkable energy savings potential if occupant behaviour is improved; the building energy consumption can be reduced by up to 9.5% with the moderate behaviour improvement, and up to 21.0% with the aggressive behaviour improvement. The simulation results accord well with the measured results within a reasonable range of deviation. The framework can be applied to estimate the energy-saving potential of occupant behaviour improvement in a building with affordable cost, and the findings can inform a behaviour improvement programme with effective and efficient measures.","Elsevier","","Lawrence Berkeley National Lab.

This paper investigates applications of MEMS sensors in commercial buildings, including pairing two absolute pressure sensors to determine differential pressures between different locations in and around buildings. Differential pressure measurements are commonly made in commercial buildings for a number of applications, including static pressure measurements for variable-speed supply fan control, air balancing in hospitals, and for envelope and duct air leakage testing. This paper focuses specifically on envelope air-leakage testing applications of these sensors. The use of continuous pressure measurements in addition to one-time non-intrusive outdoor airflow measurements of rooftop packaged units is investigated. A comparison with standardized leakage testing indicated that continuous measurements with MEMS pressure-sensors were able to estimate envelope leakage to within 3–16% of the standardized test result. In addition, the magnitude and stability of differential pressure differences that can be resolved with absolute pressure sensors are also investigated in the laboratory and the field. Results show that the sensors can be effectively used for pressures seen in low rise buildings with rooftop units.","Elsevier","","Lawrence Berkeley National Lab.

"Private versus Shared, Automated Electric Vehicles for U.S. Personal Mobility: Energy Use, Greenhouse Gas Emissions, Grid Integration, and Cost Impacts","Sheppard, Colin J.

While the convergence of shared mobility, vehicle automation, and electrification has the potential to drastically reduce transportation impacts, it requires careful integration with rapidly evolving electricity systems. Here, we examine these interactions using a U.S.-wide simulation framework encompassing private electric vehicles (EVs), shared automated EVs (SAEVs), charging infrastructure, controlled EV charging, and a grid economic dispatch model to simulate personal mobility exclusively using EVs. We find that private EVs with uncontrolled charging would reduce GHG emissions by 46% compared to gasoline vehicles. Private EVs with fleetwide controlled charging would achieve a 49% reduction in emissions from baseline and reduce peak charging demand by 53% from the uncontrolled scenario. We also find that an SAEV fleet 9% the size of today's active vehicle fleet can satisfy trip demand with only 2.6 million chargers (0.2 per EV). Such an SAEV fleet would achieve a 70% reduction in GHG emissions at 41% of the lifecycle cost as a private EV fleet with controlled charging. The emissions and cost advantage of SAEVs is primarily due to reduced vehicle manufacturing compared with private EVs.","American Chemical Society (ACS)","","Lawrence Berkeley National Lab.

"Occupant-Centric key performance indicators to inform building design and operations","Li, Han; Wang, Zhe; Hong, Tianzhen","32 ENERGY CONSERVATION, CONSUMPTION, AND UTILIZATION; building performance; occupant; KPIs; human building interaction; occupant behaviour; indoor environmental quality","Building performance indicators are widely used to guide building design and track and benchmark operational performance. Traditional building performance indicators mostly focus on the energy efficiency perspective. As occupants are the primary building service recipients in residential and most commercial buildings, their comfort and wellbeing are crucial. As such, this study first identified significant attributes of occupant-centric key performance indicators (KPIs) and analyzed the diverse factors that should be considered in formulating an occupant-centric KPI. Then a suite of occupant-centric KPIs were synthesized from the review and enhancement of existing occupant-related performance metrics. The proposed occupant KPIs represent the occupant lens on three integrative aspects of building performance: resource use (including energy and water), indoor environmental quality, and human–building interactions. A simulation-based case study was conducted to demonstrate how occupant-centric KPIs can be used to quantify the impacts of building operation changes from the occupants’ point of view. Highlights: Occupant-centric metrics are currently ad hoc and limited, yet crucial to inform building design and operations. Literature was reviewed to reveal the state-of-the-art and gaps of occupant-centric metrics. A suite of occupant-centric key performance indicators (KPIs) covering five groups of building services were synthesized. Proposed occupant KPIs represent three aspects of performance: resource use and demand, occupant comfort and health, and human–building interactions. A case study using whole building simulation was conducted to demonstrate the use of occupant-centric KPIs in evaluating building operations during a power outage.","Taylor & Francis","","Lawrence Berkeley National Lab.

Self-consumption installations shared among those living in the same building are a good example of such energy communities. In this work, a regional analysis of optimal self-consumption installations under the new legal framework recently passed in Spain is performed. Results show that the optimal sizing of the installation leads to economic savings for self-consumers in all the territory, for both options with and without remuneration for energy surplus. A sensitivity analysis on technology costs revealed that batteries still require noticeably cost reductions to be cost-effective in a behind the meter self-consumption environment. In addition, solar compensation mechanisms make batteries less attractive in a scenario of low PV costs, since feeding PV surplus into the grid, yet less efficient, becomes more cost-effective. Furthermore, an improvement for the energy surplus remuneration policy in the context of the current legislation was proposed and analysed. It consists in the inclusion of the economic value of the avoided power losses in the remuneration.","Elsevier","","Lawrence Berkeley National Lab.

Many manufacturers throughout the United States and the world have been trying to determine how to safely open and operate their plants. To minimize the number of people working within facilities and maximize the physical distance between workers, only essential facility engineers are allowed into plants to ensure proper operations. The Department of Energy’s Better Plants Program created In-Plant Trainings (INPLTs) to help partners develop in-house expertise in energy efficiency. Delivering INPLTs in the traditional in-person fashion is infeasible under these circumstances. To continue providing INPLTs during this difficult time, the Better Plants Program piloted Virtual Cohort In-Plant Trainings (VINPLTs) on wastewater treatment and ammonia industrial refrigeration systems from October 27 to November 19, 2020.

Two definitions of net zero energy performance, monthly and annual, provide different levels of energy autonomy and efficiency within a building. This article analyzes the viability and incremental cost for two-, three-, and four-story multifamily apartment buildings to reach both annual and monthly net zero energy performance throughout four climate zones in the United States using baseline reference buildings that represent current construction practices. Building size plays a large role in determining the capability for a building model to reach annual or monthly net zero. Two-story buildings are capable of reaching annual net zero with an increase in construction cost of about 4.4–5.6%. Three-story buildings in warmer climates can achieve annual net zero with an increase of about 5.1%, but models in colder climates cannot reach annual net zero performance. Four-story buildings cannot achieve net zero, owing to insufficient building area for solar arrays to produce electricity. Monthly net zero energy performance was significantly harder to achieve, with the only case reaching this goal being the two-story Houston based model, at an added cost of 8.2%. Generally speaking, only small buildings in warm climates will be able to achieve monthly net zero without vastly oversizing photovoltaic systems and increasing costs without adequate payback.","American Society of Civil Engineers","","National Renewable Energy Lab.

"High salinity seawater boiling point elevation: Experimental verification","Elsayed, Mohamed L.; Wu, Wei; Chow, Louis C.","32 ENERGY CONSERVATION, CONSUMPTION, AND UTILIZATION; High salinity; seawater; Boiling point elevation; Zero liquid discharge","Boiling point elevation (BPE) for high salinity solutions is a crucial parameter that significantly affects the overall thermal efficiency of desalination, water treatment, and many other industrial processing systems, especially when minimum or zero liquid discharge is a key requirement. This paper addresses the discrepancies among the empirical correlations reported in the literature that were commonly used to determine BPE for seawater solutions. An evaluation of the experimental data with low solution concentration reveals that the data cannot be extrapolated to determine the BPE at high concentration (X > 140 ppt or g/kg). Besides, disparities are established within different equations used to determine the BPE for high salinity seawater. As a result of the minimal availability of experimental data of BPE for X > 140 ppt and the need to eliminate the discrepancies, an experimental setup was built, which can produce reliable and repeatable BPE data for any solution concentration. Boiling points were obtained experimentally for seawater solutions with a wide range of salinity (X between 20 and 280 ppt) and brine solution temperature (t<sub>b</sub> between 20 and 80°C). The experimental results of boiling point elevations for seawater are further compared with the experimental data and analytical results reported in the literature. The newly obtained experimental results show that the minimum and maximum BPE values for the brine solutions tested are 0.175°C at t<sub>b</sub> = 80°C and X = 20 ppt, and 11.6°C at t<sub>b</sub> = 80°C and X = 280 ppt, respectively. Furthermore, the measured BPE data for seawater concentration over 80 ppt are fitted and presented using an appropriate fitting model. The new correlation can accurately predict the BPE for high salinity seawater brines and thus should be very helpful in the design of high-energy-efficient evaporation systems.","Elsevier","","Savengy Technologies, LLC, Orlando, FL (United States)","USDOE Office of Science and Technology (ST); USDOE","","United States","2021-02-01T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: Desalination; Journal Volume: 504","","Medium: ED; Size: Article No. 114955","","","SC0020060","Journal ID: ISSN 0011-9164","10.1016/j.desal.2021.114955","","2022-02-01T00:00:00Z","1774191","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/1774191","https://www.osti.gov/servlets/purl/1774191","Desalination","","504"

On the demand side, climate change could shift demand patterns due to increased air temperatures. On the supply side, climate change could lead to deratings of thermal units due to changes in air temperature, water temperature, and water availability. Past studies have typically analyzed these risks separately. Here, we developed an integrated, multimodel framework to analyze how compounding risks of climate-change impacts on demand and supply affect long-term planning decisions in the power system. In the southeast U.S., we found that compounding climate-change impacts could result in a 35% increase in installed capacity by 2050 relative to the reference case. Participation of renewables, particularly solar, in the fleet increased, driven mostly by the expected increase in summertime peak demand.

"Increasing the Number of Installed Residential Heat Pump Water Heaters in the USA Through Improved Technology and Utility Programs","Sparn, Bethany; Maguire, Jeff","32 ENERGY CONSERVATION, CONSUMPTION, AND UTILIZATION; connected water heater; grid-interactive water heater; split heat pump water heater; retrofit-ready heat pump water heater; midstream programs; heat pump water heater","Heat pump water heaters (HPWHs) offer an efficient alternative to electric resistance water heaters, but they suffer from limited market penetration. This paper reviews the current state of HPWHs in the USA, focusing on technology developments and programs to increase adoption. What technological improvements are needed to make HPWHs a good fit in more homes? Additionally, what are the best ways of promoting HPWHs to consumers? Improved communication and controls will allow HPWHs to provide demand response and follow dynamic utility rates. To enable fuel-switching, HPWHs are being developed that only need a standard 120V outlet. Split HPWHs can alleviate the cooling and noise that limit the use of HPWHs in small homes, multifamily buildings, and cold climates. Additionally, new utility programs aim to train installers and provide incentives to distributors to increase the number of HPWHs installed. Some utilities offer novel incentive programs that have led to increased customer uptake. Those advances, coupled with improved controls for load shifting and new products such as split HPWHs and HPWHs that can run on 120V power, may finally move the market forward.","Springer","","National Renewable Energy Lab.

It follows from a significant reduction in electricity consumption in the hot period, and hence lower operating costs for cooling systems. This paper presents the current state of knowledge and research directions on dew point indirect evaporative cooling. It was found that researchers focus on the development of dew point indirect evaporative coolers (DPIEC) by improving its design, geometry, water distribution, and new porous materials implementation. To evaluate the performance of new types of DPIEC, different methods are used by the scientists. Finally, optimized devices are studied in terms of their performance in different systems, like hybrid and desiccant systems, considering different climate conditions.

"Minimizing Energy Use of Mixed-Fleet Public Transit for Fixed-Route Service","Sivagnanam, Amutheezan; Ayman, Afiya; Wilbur, Michael; Pugliese, Philip; Dubey, Abhishek; Laszka, Aron","32 ENERGY CONSERVATION, CONSUMPTION, AND UTILIZATION; Mobility; Transportation","Affordable public transit services are crucial for communities since they enable residents to access employment, education, and other services. Unfortunately, transit services that provide wide coverage tend to suffer from relatively low utilization, which results in high fuel usage per passenger per mile, leading to high operating costs and environmental impact. Electric vehicles (EVs) can reduce energy costs and environmental impact, but most public transit agencies have to employ them in combination with conventional, internal-combustion engine vehicles due to the high upfront costs of EVs. To make the best use of such a mixed fleet of vehicles, transit agencies need to optimize route assignments and charging schedules, which presents a challenging problem for large transit networks. We introduce a novel problem formulation to minimize fuel and electricity use by assigning vehicles to transit trips and scheduling them for charging, while serving an existing fixed-route transit schedule. We present an integer program for optimal assignment and scheduling, and we propose polynomial-time heuristic and meta-heuristic algorithms for larger networks. We evaluate our algorithms on the public transit service of Chattanooga, TN using operational data collected from transit vehicles. Our results show that the proposed algorithms are scalable and can reduce energy use and, hence, environmental impact and operational costs. For Chattanooga, the proposed algorithms can save $145,635 in energy costs and 576.7 metric tons of CO<sub>2</sub> emission annually.","Association for the Advancement of Artificial Intelligence","","Vanderbilt Univ., Nashville, TN (United States); University of Houston; Chattanooga Area Regional Transportation Authority, Chattanooga, TN (United States)","USDOE Office of Energy Efficiency and Renewable Energy (EERE)","","United States","2021-05-18T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: Proceedings of the AAAI Conference on Artificial Intelligence; Journal Volume: 35; Journal Issue: 17; Conference: AAAI Special Track on AI for Social Impact","","Medium: ED; Size: p. 14930-14938","","","EE0008467","Journal ID: ISSN 2159-5399","10.1609/aaai.v35i17.17752","","2022-09-30T00:00:00Z","1824215","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/1824215","https://www.osti.gov/servlets/purl/1824215","Proceedings of the AAAI Conference on Artificial Intelligence","17","35"

In this paper, we review the application of machine learning techniques in building load prediction under the organization and logic of the machine learning, which is to perform tasks T using Performance measure P and based on learning from Experience E. Firstly, we review the applications of building load prediction model (task T). Then, we review the modeling algorithms that improve machine learning performance and accuracy (performance P). Throughout the papers, we also review the literature from the data perspective for modeling (experience E), including data engineering from the sensor level to data level, pre-processing, feature extraction and selection.

The model was implemented with various liquid desiccants and their properties (including LiCl, CaCl<sub>2</sub>, and [emim][OMS] ionic liquid [IL]). The model has been validated using data from two laboratory prototype absorbers, one with CaCl<sub>2</sub> as the working fluid and one with an IL as the working fluid. Entropy analysis was further carried out to verify the model and understand effect of internal cooling on the entropy variation of three fluid streams. The developed model and codes are expected to enable detailed configuration optimization and provide in-depth understanding of three-fluid heat and mass exchanger (HMX) performance. The paper also describes parametric studies of the HMX components in utilizing the latent heat removed in space cooling to heat water and numerically explores the unique benefit of its application in a semi-open absorption heat pump water heater.

Here, we study the superior catalytic behaviors of the Pt<sub>3</sub>Ni nanowire (NW) over each individual, Pt and Ni NWs during the reverse Water Gas Shift (rWGS) reaction, using density functional theory. The results show that the promoted rWGS activity by Pt3Ni strongly depends on the ensemble effect (a particular arrangement of active sites introduced by alloying), while the contributions from ligand and strain effects, which are of great importance in electrocatalysis, are rather subtle. As a result, a unique Ni–Pt hybrid ensemble is observed at the 110/111 edge of the Pt<sub>3</sub>Ni NW, where the synergy between Ni and Pt sites is active enough to stabilize carbon dioxide on the surface readily for the rWGS reaction but moderate enough to allow for the facile removal of carbon monoxide and hydrogenation of hydroxyl species. Furthermore, our study highlights the importance of the ensemble effect in heterogeneous catalysis of metal alloys, enabling selective binding–tuning and promotion of catalytic activity.","American Institute of Physics (AIP)","","Brookhaven National Lab.

"Energy-efficient sorption-based gas clothes dryer systems","Ahmadi, Masoud; Gluesenkamp, Kyle R.; Bigham, Sajjad","32 ENERGY CONSERVATION, CONSUMPTION, AND UTILIZATION; 42 ENGINEERING; dehydration; sorption-based systems; gas-driven systems; advanced gas clothes dryer systems; dehumidification; moisture latent heat","Standard electric resistance and fuel-driven dehydration technologies exhibit a maximum coefficient of performance of well below 1 mainly due to enthalpy losses associated with the air leaving the dehydration system. To improve energy efficiency, condensing dryer systems condense the moisture captured from a product in a closed-loop air circulation cycle. Existing condensing dehydration systems including heat pump dryers, however, need to significantly cool the air to achieve dehumidification. The added cooling and subsequent heating to return the air to a desired drying temperature consume substantial energy and thus reduce drying performance. Here, an innovative sorption-based gas dehydration system is proposed to overcome barriers deteriorating energy efficiency in existing gas, electric, or heat pump dryer systems. Decoupling latent and sensible loads, the system employs a liquid-desiccant solution to directly capture air humidity, thereby allowing circulation of the air in a closed loop to achieve high drying energy efficiency. In other words, the system captures waste latent heat from the moisture produced during the dehydration process and reuses it to improve energy efficiency. This study focuses on a comprehensive quasi-steady-state thermodynamic modeling of the proposed sorption-based dehydration concept employed for a gas clothes dryer application to predict transient response and overall drying performance (i.e., time and energy metrics). The analysis indicates the proposed sorption-based gas clothes dryer system can deliver a specific moisture extraction rate of 1.71 kg of water per kWh (i.e., a combined energy factor of 3.167 kg (6.98 lbm) of dry cloth per kWh) with a drying time of 44 min. This is a 112% energy improvement compared with state-of-the-art gas clothes dryers exhibiting a combined energy factor of 1.50 kg (3.3 lbm) of dry cloth per kWh. The technology pursued here can potentially be employed as a platform for many fuel-driven equipment to take advantage of available waste thermal energy in the environment instead of simply burning a fuel.","Elsevier","","Oak Ridge National Lab.

Traditionally, addressing this issue has meant improving the efficiency of equipment supplying the thermal energy, reducing envelope heat transfer, and reducing air infiltration. However, this approach is already reaching practical limits. Here, we explore (1) how to reduce thermal load in buildings theoretically and (2) how to achieve that reduction and dramatically lower the energy required to support building loads practically. First, we discuss our framework developed for calculating the theoretical minimum thermal load (TMTL) in buildings. Our analysis shows that current thermal loads in buildings are more than an order of magnitude higher than the TMTL. We also introduce an approximate formula to calculate energy savings from zonal control of thermal load, which shows that the majority of zonal control benefits can be achieved with fewer than 10 zones. Then, we discuss pros and cons of various approaches and strategies to achieve the TMTL. We conclude our perspective with some longer-term R&D ideas, such as thermally adaptive clothing and thermal storage to help approach the TMTL, while providing the additional benefit of interacting with the renewable grid of the future.","Elsevier","","Lawrence Berkeley National Lab.

"Stacked Low-Inertia Converter or Solid-State Transformer: Modeling and Model Predictive Priority-Shifting Control for Voltage Balance","Zheng, Liran; Kandula, Rajendra Prasad; Kandasamy, Karthik; Divan, Deepak","25 ENERGY STORAGE; 14 SOLAR ENERGY; 17 WIND ENERGY; 24 POWER TRANSMISSION AND DISTRIBUTION; 32 ENERGY CONSERVATION, CONSUMPTION, AND UTILIZATION; 42 ENGINEERING; DC transformer (DCT); digital multivariable control; input-series output-parallel (ISOP); isolated bidirectional dc-dc converter (IBDC); medium-voltage DC (MVDC); model predictive control (MPC); modular multilevel solid-state transformer (SST); power and voltage balancing; power electronic transformer (PET); stacked low-inertia converter (SLIC)","This paper presents control challenges of stacked low-inertia converter (SLIC) or cascaded reduced dc-link solid-state transformer (SST) and proposes a novel model predictive priority-shifting (MPPS) control with implicit modulator and a discrete-time large-signal model for voltage balancing and dc-link regulation. Low-inertia converters, featuring small electrolytic capacitor-less dc links, dramatically reduce cost, size, and weight compared to conventional solutions. However, without a large dc-link buffer, the input and output are tightly coupled, leading to significant control challenges. The control becomes even more challenging with these converters stacked input-series output-parallel (ISOP) for medium-voltage (MV) grid, which causes coupling between the modules besides the coupling within each module. This paper analyzes the multi-objective, multi-degree of freedom control problem, using the modular soft-switching solid-state transformer (M-S4T) as an example of the SLIC. First, distribution of control efforts under controller saturation is critical because multiple control objectives can be conflicting, especially when the module voltages are unbalanced and are being restored. The MPPS can shift the priorities to address this issue. Second, due to the low inertia and high dc-link ripple, classic space vector pulse-width modulation (SVPWM), average model with small-ripple assumption, and control design based on small-signal model cannot accurately modulate, model, and control the nonlinear reduced dc link. Therefore, a discrete-time large-signal model of the M-S4T is established to derive the predictive control in the MPPS. The MPPS and the PI control are compared in MV simulations to show the issue of applying the PI to the SLIC and the effectiveness of the MPPS for voltage balancing and dc-link regulation in a deadbeat manner. Finally, the proposed control is tested on a 5 kV ISOP SiC SST prototype to verify priority shifting to address controller saturation issue and fast and robust voltage balancing.","IEEE","","Georgia Institute of Technology, Atlanta, GA (United States)","USDOE Office of Energy Efficiency and Renewable Energy (EERE)","","United States","2021-01-08T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: IEEE Transactions on Power Electronics; Journal Volume: 36; Journal Issue: 8","","Medium: ED; Size: p. 8934-8952","","","EE0006521","Journal ID: ISSN 0885-8993","10.1109/tpel.2021.3050115","","2022-10-27T00:00:00Z","1894261","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/1894261","https://www.osti.gov/servlets/purl/1894261","IEEE Transactions on Power Electronics","8","36"
"Multi-objective optimization of low-GWP mixture composition and heat exchanger circuitry configuration for improved system performance and reduced refrigerant flammability","LI, Zhenning; Shen, Bo; Gluesenkamp, Kyle R.","42 ENGINEERING; 32 ENERGY CONSERVATION, CONSUMPTION, AND UTILIZATION; low-GWP; mixture; components optimization; flammability; heat exchanger; circuitry","The recently introduced hydrofluoroolefin (HFO) refrigerants, including R1234yf and R1234ze(E), have significantly lower global warming potentials (GWPs) than traditional hydrofluorocarbon (HFC) refrigerants like R410A. However, prior tests show that direct drop-in of pure R1234yf or R1234ze(E) into equipment designed for R410A results in a decrease in heat exchanger capacity and the system coefficient of performance. The primary reason is the lower in-tube heat transfer performance of R1234yf and R1234ze(E) compared with that of R410A. To address this issue, previous studies have mixed the mildly flammable HFC R32 with HFOs to improve system performance, with HFC R125 also added to suppress flammability. Previous studies selected compositions based on simple cycle analyses and did not consider modifications of the heat exchanger circuitry configuration to adapt to the new refrigerants. This study presents a novel multi-objective optimization approach to design a refrigerant composition that maximizes energy efficiency within flammability and GWP limits. The approach in this work simultaneously optimizes mixture composition and heat exchanger circuitry configuration. A case study on a rooftop unit indicates that, compared with mixture-only optimization, simultaneous optimization of mixture and heat exchanger circuitry yields a 5.9% improvement in cycle efficiency and a 48.6% reduction in refrigerant flammability with a GWP of 268. Circuitry optimization using refrigerants with different temperature glides shows that the larger the temperature glide is, the larger EER improvement is obtained. The results show that zeotropic blends with a large temperature glide are more sensitive to the refrigerant circuitry than pure refrigerants and may suffer significant performance degradation with subpar heat exchanger circuitry design. The proposed optimization approach is generally applicable to mixtures with any number of components. Using this approach to design a HVAC system can yield higher system efficiency within flammability and GWP constraints.","Elsevier","","Oak Ridge National Lab.

We conducted a comprehensive performance evaluation of eight consumer grade multi-parameter monitors and eight single-parameter sensors in detecting particulate matter, carbon dioxide, total volatile organic compounds, dry-bulb air temperature, and relative humidity. In the controlled chamber, we generated eight air pollution sources, each at two thermodynamic conditions — cool and dry (20 ± 1 °C, 30 ± 5%), and warm and humid (26 ± 1 °C, 70 ± 5%). The majority of tested devices under-reported reference particle measurements by up to 50%, provided acceptable responses for carbon dioxide within 15% and diverging results with poor quantitative agreement for total volatile organic compounds. Here, despite the reported disparities in quantitative agreements, most of the low-cost devices could detect source events and were strongly correlated with the reference data, suggesting that these units could be suitable for measurement-based indoor air quality management. Most of the tested devices have also proven to competently measure air temperature (within+/-0.6 °C) and relative humidity (within+/-5% RH) and maintained a stable measurement accuracy over the two thermodynamic conditions.","Elsevier","","Lawrence Berkeley National Lab.

"Operation and performance of VRF systems: Mining a large-scale dataset","Qian, Mingyang; Yan, Da; Hong, Tianzhen; Liu, Hua","32 ENERGY CONSERVATION, CONSUMPTION, AND UTILIZATION; VRF system; Data mining; Big data; System performance; China; Energy efficiency","The energy consumption of air-conditioning systems has gained increasing attention as it contributes significantly to the global building energy use. The variable refrigerant flow (VRF) system is a common air-conditioning system applied widely in residential and office buildings in China. Understanding the actual operation and performance of VRF systems is fundamental for the energy-efficient design and operation of VRF systems. Previous research on VRF system operation used either limited field data covering certain building types and climate zones or used a questionnaire to obtain a larger dataset. However, they did not capture the wide applications of VRF systems quantitatively across all building types, climate zones, and operating conditions. To fill this gap, statistical and clustering analysis was conducted on the newly proposed key performance indicators of approximately 287,000 VRF systems for residential and commercial buildings in all five climate zones in China. In this work, the main findings are: (1) VRF systems are mainly used for cooling in all climate zones in China; (2) among all building types, the duration of use is lowest in residential buildings and highest in hotels and medical buildings; (3) the distribution of the ideal VRF cooling coefficient of performance (COP) is similar across all climate zones and building types; whereas the COPs of ideal VRF heating in the Severe Cold region and Cold regions are lower than those in other climate zones; and (4) partial load operations for VRF systems are common in residential buildings and office buildings due to the part-time-part-space operation mode. These findings can inform the actual application of VRF systems in China, supporting the design, operation, industry standard development, and performance optimization of VRF systems.","Elsevier","","Lawrence Berkeley National Lab.

"Automated fault detection of residential air-conditioning systems using thermostat drive cycles","Chintala, Rohit; Winkler, Jon; Jin, Xin","32 ENERGY CONSERVATION, CONSUMPTION, AND UTILIZATION; automated fault detection; residential air-conditioning systems; gray-box modeling","Residential air conditioning equipment comprises a significant portion of the total energy consumption of a home. Unfortunately, air-conditioning systems can be susceptible to faulty operation either from installation errors or faults that accrue over the equipment’s lifetime. This paper presents a novel automated fault detection algorithm for residential air-conditioning systems that can alert the homeowner of the presence of these faults. The proposed algorithm utilizes only the home’s thermostat and outside air temperature to perform automated fault detection over the course of the equipment’s lifetime, including immediately after installation. The algorithm uses an extended Kalman filter approach to identify a three-resistor, two-capacitor (3R2C) electrical equivalent thermodynamic model. The identified 3R2C model is used to predict cooling times during a testing period comprising of a series of thermostat drive-cycle experiments. We tested the algorithm on an EnergyPlus™ model of a typical residential building in Orlando, Florida. Duct faults, indoor airflow faults, and refrigerant undercharge faults were introduced into the building model one at a time. The algorithm was able to accurately determine duct-leak faults, 40% airflow faults, 40% undercharge faults, and no-fault cases with an accuracy of 70%, 77%, 82%, and 87%, respectively.","Elsevier","","National Renewable Energy Lab.

In this paper, to fulfill the increasing need of accurate Low-GWP supermarket refrigeration models for development of supervisory level control and optimization strategies, a high fidelity model is developed for CO<sub>2</sub> transcritical supermarket refrigeration system which includes compressor rack of low temperature (LT) compressors and medium temperature (MT) compressors, air-cooled gas cooler, evaporator, expansion valves and other auxiliary equipment. A resistance-capacity model structure is proposed to simulate the display cases. Semi-thermodynamic models are proposed to estimate reciprocating compressors volumetric efficiency and power consumption. Furthermore the zone modeling approach is used for evaporator simulation, and air-cooled gas cooler is modeled with distributed modeling method. The expansion valve simulation is based on orifice flow model. To calibrate these models, both manufacture performance data and experimental data are used. The experiments are conducted with a full instrumental CO<sub>2</sub> supermarket refrigeration system installed in Oak Ridge National Lab Flexible Research Platform (FRP). The simulation model can predict the system performance, including power consumption, cooling capacity, mass flow rate, temperature, and pressure, with high accuracy (within ±4%) compared to experimental data. In addition, this developed model has been used to create the system optimum high side pressure for high side expansion valve control, and to generate wide operating range simulation data for developing the batter-equivalent commercial refrigeration system model which can be used in grid interactive control development.","Elsevier","","Oak Ridge National Lab.

"Analysis of different operating strategies of thermal energy storage with radiant cooling system","Singh, Rana Pratap; Mathur, Jyotirmay; Bhandari, Mahabir","25 ENERGY STORAGE; 32 ENERGY CONSERVATION, CONSUMPTION, AND UTILIZATION","Thermal energy storage systems in building cooling applications have been explored extensively as a peak load-shifting technology. Thermal energy storage performance has been recognized and studied from an energy cost-savings point of view because of peak-valley price differences, but not many studies have been conducted from an energy savings viewpoint. This study experimentally investigates the performance of the energy storage-retrofitted to a ceiling-type radiant cooling system. To study the performance, a water-based storage system was designed and developed for an academic office building equipped with a radiant cooling system. The water in the storage tank was cooled to a certain storage temperature in the nighttime, and the same water was used during the daytime for meeting the cooling load. Different combinations of charging and discharging schedules were analyzed. The key objective of the study was to achieve energy savings and energy-cost savings simultaneously. This objective was accomplished by identifying the major factors contributing to the energy consumption of the storage-retrofitted cooling system and devising novel operating strategies, leading to an enhanced energy savings potential. Two operating strategies comprising 24 operating scenarios were compared and the storage was used to dispatch the load for 3 hours of the day as a full storage unit. Results showed that in hot and dry climate conditions, using the storage with the radiant cooling system offered energy savings of 3% to 14%. The energy-cost analysis was also performed using a time-of-day electricity tariff plan. The energy-cost savings varied from 17.5% to 22.4% for these operating scenarios.","Wiley","","Oak Ridge National Lab.

"Automating the interpretation of PM<sub>2.5</sub> time–resolved measurements using a data–driven approach","Tang, Hao; Chan, Wanyu Rengie; Sohn, Michael D.","32 ENERGY CONSERVATION, CONSUMPTION, AND UTILIZATION","The rapid development of automated measurement equipment enables researchers to collect greater quantities of time-resolved data from indoor and outdoor environments. While significant, the interpretation of the resulting data can be a time-consuming effort. This paper introduces an automated process of interpreting PM<sub>2.5</sub> time-resolved data and differentiating PM<sub>2.5</sub> emissions resulting from indoor and outdoor sources. Here, we use Random Forest (RF), a machine learning approach, to study a dataset of 836 indoor emission events that occurred over a 2-week period in 18 apartments in California. In this paper, we show model development and evaluate its performance as the sample size and source vary. We discuss the characteristics of the dataset that tended to help the source identification and why. For example, we show that data from many events and from different apartments are essential for the model to be suitable for analyzing a new separate dataset. We also show that longitudinal data appear to be more helpful than the time frequency of measurements within a given apartment. We use the resulting RF model to analyze PM<sub>2.5</sub> data of an entirely separate dataset collected from 65 new homes in California. The RF model identifies 442 indoor emission events, with only a few misidentifications.","Wiley","","Lawrence Berkeley National Lab.

We find evidence that TNC entry into urban areas causes an average 0.7% increase in vehicle registrations with significant heterogeneity in these effects across urban areas: TNC entry produces larger vehicle ownership increases in urban areas with higher initial ownership (car-dependent cities) and in urban areas with lower population growth (where TNC-induced vehicle adoption outpaces population growth). We also find no statistically significant average effect of TNC entry on fuel economy or transit use but find evidence of heterogeneity in these effects across urban areas, including larger transit ridership reductions after TNC entry in areas with higher income and more childless households.","Elsevier","","National Renewable Energy Lab.

However, these ducts are often neglected in heat loss calculations, as their impact on the overall heat recovery efficiency of HRV systems is often not understood and, to the knowledge of the authors, a mathematical model for the overall heat recovery efficiency of HRV systems that accounts for these ducts has not been published. In this research, a mathematical model for the overall heat recovery efficiency of HRV systems that accounts for the intake and exhaust ducts was derived and validated using real-life data. The model-predicted decrease in heat recovery efficiency due to the ducts was in reasonable agreement (relative error within 20%) with the real-life measurements. The results suggest that utilizing this model allows for more correct ventilation heat loss calculations compared to using the heat recovery efficiency of the HRV unit alone, but more field studies are needed to verify the accuracy of this model in a wide range of applications.","MDPI AG","","National Renewable Energy Lab.

This paper presents a comprehensive characteristics analysis and potential assessment of the power flexibility from heating, ventilation, and air conditioning (HVAC) loads in commercial buildings in the U.S. using a simulation-based method. In this method, commercial buildings are first grouped by building types and climate regions. The U.S. Department of Energy Commercial Prototype Building Models are used to represent an average building in each group and are simulated to characterize corresponding power flexibility. Based on building survey data, the number of commercial buildings in each group is estimated and used to calculate aggregate power flexibility. It is found that HVAC loads in commercial buildings offer more flexibility for increasing power consumption than for decreasing it. The power consumption of commercial buildings in the U.S. can be increased by 46 GW and decreased by 40 GW on peak summer days. Among all commercial building types, standalone retail buildings provide the most absolute flexibility while the medium office buildings have the most flexibility as a percentage of the rated power consumption.","Elsevier","","National Renewable Energy Lab.

"Enhancing building energy performance by effectively using phase change material and dynamic insulation in walls","Kishore, Ravi Anant; Bianchi, Marcus V. A.; Booten, Chuck; Vidal, Judith; Jackson, Roderick","32 ENERGY CONSERVATION, CONSUMPTION, AND UTILIZATION; buildings; phase change material; envelope; insulation","Deploying phase change materials (PCMs) in building envelopes can be efficacious in reducing space heating/cooling loads and providing load shedding and shifting capacity. However, the full potential of PCM-integrated envelopes can only be harnessed if the PCM undergoes phase change using free ambient heating/cooling, and the stored energy is effectively transferred between the exterior and the interior environments. Traditional thermal insulation (with a fixed thermal resistance) limits PCM utilization, which restrains the energy saving potential of a PCM-integrated envelope to a small percentage. Proposed dynamic insulation material and system (DIMS) provides the option of varying its thermal resistance based on the indoor and outdoor conditions. Although it has been established that employing PCM as well as DIMS in building envelopes separately improves buildings’ energy performance, no prior studies that analyzed the combined influence of both technologies were identified. In this study, we examine a novel wall design, comprising a layer of PCM between two layers of DIMS. We note that the PCM-DIMS-integrated wall provides significantly higher energy saving potential than the DIMS-only integrated wall or the PCM-only integrated wall in all the climates and wall orientations analyzed in this study. Depending on the climate, the PCM-DIMS-integrated wall could provide 15–72% reduction in annual heat gain and 7–38% reduction in annual heat loss. The analysis presented in this study supports the need to develop scalable dynamic insulations combined with thermal energy storage systems for buildings.","Elsevier","","National Renewable Energy Lab.

This paper explores a novel method for uncovering heterogeneity in households. In this work, we use a machine-learning method known as a Conditional Inference Tree (c-tree) algorithm to categorize households based on their energy behavior characteristics collected via smart meters, and explore how this translates through into heterogeneity in their real-world response to a DR program. Using data from randomized controlled trial, we generate estimates of the changes in energy use caused by the program within each household group. Our results show that the c-tree approach differentiates households by their energy-use characteristics in a way that increases the spread in enrollment rates and critical peak reduction among household groups, compared with the spreads achieved via several conventional segmentation methods. Thus, the c-tree analysis enables the most tailored targeting of major potential energy savers and could provide the greatest increase in cost-effectiveness of household recruitment into DR programs. Our results also offer fresh insights into the relationships between household energy behavior characteristics – such as peak energy use and “structural winningness” (the ability to save money under a DR program without changing energy-use behaviors) – and household decisions about enrolling in DR programs and reducing energy use. Our research also demonstrates the potential of smart meter data, combined with machine learning and econometric methods, to provide significant value to utilities, program implementers, researchers, and other stakeholders.","Elsevier","","Lawrence Berkeley National Lab.

To quantify their potential benefits, it is important to know how frequently and under what conditions range hoods are operated during cooking. We analyzed data from 54 single family houses and 17 low-income apartments in California in which cooking activities, range hood use, and fine particulate matter (PM<sub>2.5</sub>) were monitored for one week per home. Range hoods were used for 36% of cooking events in houses and 28% in apartments. The frequency of hood use increased with cooking frequency across homes. In both houses and apartments, the likelihood of hood use during a cooking event increased with the duration of cooktop burner use, but not with the duration of oven use. Actual hood use rates were higher in the homes of participants who self-reported more frequent use in a pre-study survey, but actual use was far lower than self-reported frequency. Residents in single family houses used range hoods more often when cooking caused a discernible increase in PM<sub>2.5</sub>. In apartments, residents used their range hood more often only when high concentrations of PM<sub>2.5</sub> were generated during cooking.","MDPI","","Lawrence Berkeley National Lab.

As these real fuels have too many fuel components to be included in a chemical kinetic model, surrogate fuels containing fewer components are used to represent them. These surrogate fuels mimic the chemical classes or molecular structures contained in the real fuel. One of the important chemical classes in gasoline, jet, and diesel fuels comprises cyclohexanes. Cyclohexanes comprise about 30% or more by weight in diesel fuel. Also, Mueller et al proposed n-butylcyclohexane (nBCH) as a component in a nine-component surrogate palette to represent the ignition properties, distillation curve, density, and molecular structures of a diesel certification fuel. Herein, experimental measurements of the ignition delay times (IDTs) of nBCH in a shock tube and in a rapid compression machine are reported over a wide range of temperature, pressure, and equivalence ratio important for enabling the validation of a chemical kinetic model for nBCH for combustion in diesel engines. The range of conditions are temperatures of 630–1420 K, pressures of 10, 30, and 50 bar, and equivalence ratios of 0.3, 0.5, 1.0, and 2.0 in ‘air’. A detailed chemical model is developed for nBCH to simulate its ignition at both low and high-temperature conditions and at relevant elevated pressures. The experimentally measured IDTs are used to improve and validate the chemical kinetic model.","Wiley","External Audience (Unlimited)","Lawrence Livermore National Lab.

"The impact of wind, solar, and other factors on the decline in wholesale power prices in the United States","Mills, Andrew; Wiser, Ryan; Millstein, Dev; Carvallo, Juan Pablo; Gorman, Will; Seel, Joachim; Jeong, Seongeun","32 ENERGY CONSERVATION, CONSUMPTION, AND UTILIZATION; Variable renewable energy; wholesale power market prices; grid integration; electricity policy","Across multiple organized wholesale power markets in the United States, annual average prices declined by 19–64 dollars per MWh between 2008 and 2017 while retirements of thermal power plants accelerated. Several prominent changes over the last decade are often discussed as contributors to this decline in prices. These include growth in wind and solar, a reduction in the price of natural gas, and weakened load growth. Here we construct a fundamental supply curve model for each of seven organized wholesale market regions and use counterfactual simulations to assess the degree to which wind and solar—among other factors—have influenced wholesale electricity prices. We find that growth in wind and solar since 2008 reduced average annual wholesale electricity prices by less than 3 dollars per MWh. In contrast the decline in natural gas prices reduced wholesale prices by 7–53 dollars per MWh, depending on the region. This suggests that recent thermal-plant retirements in the U.S. are primarily due to low natural gas prices, not growth in wind and solar. Fully isolating the impact of individual factors, however, is limited by non-linear interactions between factors.","Elsevier","","Lawrence Berkeley National Lab.

To contribute to this, we have performed an evidence map of roadmaps for zero and low energy and carbon buildings (ZLECB) worldwide, including a list and classification of documents in an on-line geographical map, a description of gaps, and a narrative review of the knowledge gluts. We have retrieved 1219 scientific documents from Scopus, extracted metadata from 274 documents, and identified 117 roadmaps, policies or plans from 27 countries worldwide. We find that there is a coverage bias towards more developed regions. The identified scientific studies are mostly recommendations to policy makers, different types of case studies, and demonstration projects. The geographical inequalities found in the coverage of the scientific literature are even more extreme in the coverage of the roadmaps. These underexplored world regions represent an area for further investigation and increased research/policy attention. Our review of the more substantial amount of literature and roadmaps for developed regions shows differences in target metrics and enforcement mechanisms but that all regions dedicate some efforts at national and local levels. Roadmaps generally focus more on new and public buildings than existing buildings, despite the fact that the latter are naturally larger in number and total floor area, and perform less energy efficiently. A combination of efficiency, technical upgrades, and renewable generation is generally proposed in the roadmaps, with behavioral measures only reflected in the use of information and communication technologies, and minimal focus being placed on lifecycle perspectives. We conclude that insufficient progress is being made in the implementation of ZLECB. More work is needed to couple the existing climate goals, with realistic, enforceable policies to make the carbon savings a reality for different contexts and stakeholders worldwide.","IOP Publishing","","National Renewable Energy Lab.

The successful adoption of EVs heavily depends on energy consumption models that can accurately and reliably estimate electricity consumption. This paper reviews the state-of-the-art of EV energy consumption models, aiming to provide guidance for future development of EV applications. Here, we summarize influential variables of EV energy consumption into four categories: vehicle component, vehicle dynamics, traffic and environment related factors. We classify and discuss EV energy consumption models in terms of modeling scale (microscopic vs. macroscopic) and methodology (data-driven vs. rule-based). Our review shows trends of increasing macroscopic models that can be used to estimate trip-level EV energy consumption and increasing data-driven models that utilized machine learning technologies to estimate EV energy consumption based on large volume real-world data. We identify research gaps for EV energy consumption models, including the development of energy estimation models for modes other than personal vehicles (e.g., electric buses, electric trucks, and electric non-road vehicles); the development of energy estimation models that are suitable for applications related to vehicle-to-grid integration; and the development of multi-scale energy estimation models as a holistic modeling approach.","SAE International","","Vanderbilt Univ., Nashville, TN (United States); Chattanooga Area Regional Transportation Authority, Chattanooga, TN (United States)","USDOE Office of Energy Efficiency and Renewable Energy (EERE)","","United States","2021-03-29T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: SAE International Journal of Sustainable Transportation, Energy, Environment, & Policy (Online); Journal Volume: 2; Journal Issue: 1","","Medium: ED; Size: p. 79-96","","","EE0008467","Journal ID: ISSN 2640-6438","10.4271/13-02-01-0005","","2023-02-06T00:00:00Z","1824218","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/1824218","https://www.osti.gov/servlets/purl/1824218","SAE International Journal of Sustainable Transportation, Energy, Environment, & Policy (Online)","1","2"

We dissect our controller into two parts: 1. the unconnected mode, active when following a human-driven vehicle, and 2. the connected mode, active when following another automated vehicle equipped with connectivity. Probabilistic constraints balance safety considerations with inter-vehicle compactness, and vehicle constraints for acceleration capabilities are expressed through the use of powertrain maps. Emergent highway traffic scenarios are then modeled using time headway distributions from empirical traffic data. To study the impact of automation over a range of demands of free-flow to stop-and-go, we vary vehicle flux from low to high and vary automated vehicle penetration from low to high. When examining all-human driving scenarios, network capacity failed to meet demand in high-volume scenarios, such as rush-hour traffic. We further find that with connected automated vehicles introduced, network capacity was improved to support the high-volume scenarios. Finally, we examine energy efficiencies of the fleet for conventional, electric, and hybrid vehicles. We find that automated vehicles perform at a 10%-20% higher energy efficiency over human drivers when considering conventional powertrains, and find that automated vehicles perform at a 3%-9% higher energy efficiency over human drivers when considering electric and hybrid powertrains. Due to secondary effects of smoothing traffic flow and reducing unnecessary braking, energy benefits also apply to human-driven vehicles that interact with automated ones. Such simulated humans were found to drive up to 10% more energy-efficiently than they did in the baseline all-human scenario.","Elsevier","","Argonne National Lab.

As many researches have proven the effectiveness of using Artificial Neural Network inair compressor performance prediction, there is still a need to forecast the air compressor electrical load profile. The objective of this study is to predict compressed air systems’ electrical load profile, which is valuable to industry practitioners as well as software providers in developing better practice and tools for load managementand look-ahead scheduling programs. Two artificial neural networks, Two-Layer Feed-Forward Neural Networkand Long Short-Term Memory were used to predict an air compressors electrical load. Compressors with three different control mechanisms are evaluated with a total number of 11,874 observations. Here, the forecasts were validated using out-of-sample datasets with 5-fold cross-validation. Models produced average coefficient ofdetermination values from 0.24 to 0.94, average root-mean-square errors from 0.05 kW - 5.83 kW, and meanabsolute scaled errors from 0.20 to 1.33. The results indicate that both artificial neural networks yield goodresults for compressors using variable speed drive (average R<sup>2</sup> = 0.8 and no naïve forecasting), only the longshort-term memory model gives acceptable results for compressors using on/off control (average R<sup>2</sup> = 0.82 and no naïve forecasting), and no satisfactory results are obtained for load/unload type air compressors (models constituting active forecasting).","Elsevier","","Indiana Univ., Indianapolis, IN (United States)","USDOE Office of Energy Efficiency and Renewable Energy (EERE), Energy Efficiency Office.

"Vertical meteorological patterns and their impact on the energy demand of tall buildings","Gui, Chenxi; Yan, Da; Hong, Tianzhen; Xiao, Chan; Guo, Siyue; Tao, Yifan","32 ENERGY CONSERVATION, CONSUMPTION, AND UTILIZATION; 54 ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCES; Meteorological towers; Building energy demands; Microclimates; Vertical meteorological patterns; Weather parameters; Tall buildings","In accordance with the developing economy and growing population, an increasing number of tall buildings have been constructed over the last 20 years. In 2017, there were 144 new buildings worldwide that were 200 m or greater in height; 50% of these buildings were in China. Due to the vertical gradient impact of meteorological parameters, the energy performance of tall buildings differs from that of general buildings. Few studies exist on vertical meteorological changes using measured data at different heights. Most studies on dynamic energy simulation simulate meteorological parameters using models. This study explores vertical meteorological patterns using hourly dry-bulb temperature, relative humidity, and wind speed data from 2007 to 2017 for a 325 m meteorological tower in Beijing. The temperature decreased significantly with increasing altitude (~0.9 °C per 100 m), while the daily temperature difference decreased with increasing altitude. The absolute humidity did not change significantly with height. The wind speed increased with altitude at approximately 2 m/s per 100 m. The building simulation showed that the annual heating load at a height of 320 m increased by 85% from that at 8 m; the annual cooling load decreased by 20%. Such significant differences in thermal loads for 300-m-tall buildings confirm the need to consider vertical meteorological differences in building performance simulations for tall buildings. A greater number of measurement points at different heights improve the simulation accuracy. Finally, guidance on selecting the heights for vertical metrological measurements is provided based on the influences of building thermal loads.","Elsevier","","Lawrence Berkeley National Lab.

How the water enters the tank can significantly affect the extraction efficiency of the storage. Vertical-tube inlets (VTIs) direct cold water into the tank. The VTI design influences whether large-scale mixing occurs, which can reduce the delivery capacity of the hot-water storage. In this work, the mixing at the VTI discharge was characterized by the eddy diffusivity factor (EDF) in an allometric curve fit to the ratio Re:Ri using inlet superficial velocities. The full experimental campaign tested VTI's with Re’s between 170 and 22,300 and Ri's between 0 and 376. Animated visualization of the experimentally measured data is provided, showing tank temperature evolution during inlet flows. The most predictive correlations for EDF are for VTI Re in the transition zone (i.e. ~2300 < Re < ~10,000) and at a Ri corresponding to a stably stratified tank (i.e. Ri > 5). For vertical-tubes that distribute cold water below the thermocline, increasing the EDF will decrease the stratification in a hot-water tank as EDF quantifies inlet mixing. The new correlations for VTIs can be used to design and model thermally-stratified storage tanks.","Elsevier","","Oak Ridge National Lab. (ORNL), Oak Ridge, TN (United States); Argonne National Lab.

"Dirty dishes or dirty laundry? Comparing two methods for quantifying American consumers' preferences for load management in a smart home","Aloise-Young, Patricia A.; Lurbe, Salvador; Isley, Steven; Kadavil, Rahul; Suryanarayanan, Siddharth; Christensen, Dane","32 ENERGY CONSERVATION, CONSUMPTION, AND UTILIZATION; smart home; demand response; load shifting; AHP; SMARTER","One challenge of transitioning to renewable energy is that household electricity use and renewable generation are often misaligned. Smart home energy management systems hold promise for shifting usage to match generation, but these systems need to be designed with the occupants’ preferences in mind. The purpose of the present research is to compare two approaches for collecting and modeling consumers’ load management preferences, both of which are amenable to use in a home energy management system. Specifically, we examine the performance of Simple Multi-Attribute Rating Technique Exploiting Ranks (SMARTER) and Analytic Hierarchy Process (AHP) in quantifying consumers’ preferences regarding air temperature (air conditioning and heating), water heating, dishwashing, clothes washing and drying, monetary costs, environmental impacts, and comfort/convenience. Two studies are presented: Study 1 examines the SMARTER approach, and Study 2 focuses on the AHP approach. In both studies, online surveys (N<sub>SMARTER</sub> = 956 and N<sub>AHP</sub> = 1023) were conducted to elicit preferences from participants across the United States. The preferences modeled by both approaches were validated based on (a) their ability to predict participants’ choices in a Discrete Choice Experiment and (b) their convergence with previous research on load-shifting behavior. The validation procedure suggests that the SMARTER approach is superior in modeling consumers’ preferences for load management. Overall, this research lays the groundwork for designing a smart home interface capable of collecting occupants’ preferences and using those preferences to deliver improved occupant comfort, lower operating costs, reduced environmental impact, and more significant demand response than exists today.","Elsevier","","National Renewable Energy Lab.

"City-Scale Building Anthropogenic Heating during Heat Waves","Luo, Xuan; Vahmani, Pouya; Hong, Tianzhen; Jones, Andrew","32 ENERGY CONSERVATION, CONSUMPTION, AND UTILIZATION; anthropogenic heat; building heat emissions; WRF-UCM; urban building energy model; heat wave; urban microclimate","More frequent and longer duration heat waves have been observed worldwide and are recognized as a serious threat to human health and the stability of electrical grids. Past studies have identified a positive feedback between heat waves and urban heat island effects. Anthropogenic heat emissions from buildings have a crucial impact on the urban environment, and hence it is critical to understand the interactive effects of urban microclimate and building heat emissions in terms of the urban energy balance. Here we developed a coupled-simulation approach to quantify these effects, mapping urban environmental data generated by the mesoscale Weather Research and Forecasting (WRF) coupled to Urban Canopy Model (UCM) to urban building energy models (UBEM). We conducted a case study in the city of Los Angeles, California, during a five-day heat wave event in September 2009. We analyzed the surge in city-scale building heat emission and energy use during the extreme heat event. We first simulated the urban microclimate at a high resolution (500 m by 500 m) using WRF-UCM. We then generated grid-level building heat emission profiles and aggregated them using prototype building energy models informed by spatially disaggregated urban land use and urban building density data. The spatial patterns of anthropogenic heat discharge from the building sector were analyzed, and the quantitative relationship with weather conditions and urban land-use dynamics were assessed at the grid level. The simulation results indicate that the dispersion of anthropogenic heat from urban buildings to the urban environment increases by up to 20% on average and varies significantly, both in time and space, during the heat wave event. The heat dispersion from the air-conditioning heat rejection contributes most (86.5%) of the total waste heat from the buildings to the urban environment. We also found that the waste heat discharge in inland, dense urban districts is more sensitive to extreme events than it is in coastal or suburban areas. The generated anthropogenic heat profiles can be used in urban microclimate models to provide a more accurate estimation of urban air temperature rises during heat waves.","MDPI","","Lawrence Berkeley National Lab.

Solution techniques using stable explicit forward differences based on analytical solutions are derived. The conceptual model has been used for mapping the Driving temperature difference and introduced two performance factors and .

However, the optimization of residential HVAC control is no trivial task due to the complexity of the thermal dynamic models of buildings and uncertainty associated with both occupant-driven heat loads and weather forecasts. In this paper, we apply a novel model-free deep reinforcement learning (RL) method, known as the deep deterministic policy gradient (DDPG), to generate an optimal control strategy for a multi-zone residential HVAC system with the goal of minimizing energy consumption cost while maintaining the users’ comfort. Here, the applied deep RL-based method learns through continuous interaction with a simulated building environment and without referring to any prior model knowledge. Simulation results show that compared with the state-of-art deep Q network (DQN), the DDPG-based HVAC control strategy can reduce the energy consumption cost by 15% and reduce the comfort violation by 79%; and when compared with a rule-based HVAC control strategy, the comfort violation can be reduced by 98%. In addition, experiments with different building models and retail price models demonstrate that the well-trained DDPG-based HVAC control strategy has high generalization and adaptability to unseen environments, which indicates its practicability for real-world implementation.","Elsevier","","Oak Ridge National Lab.

"The impact of behavioral and geographic heterogeneity on residential-sector carbon abatement costs","Das, Saptarshi; Wilson, Eric; Williams, Eric","32 ENERGY CONSERVATION, CONSUMPTION, AND UTILIZATION; building stock modeling; residential buildings; carbon abatement; energy efficiency; marginal abatement cost curve","Analyses of monetary and emissions savings from residential efficiency upgrades usually neglect behavioral differences between consumers. Variations in behavior are frequently large: 13% of the U.S. population sets thermostats for cooling at 20 °C (68 °F) or lower and 15% at 25.5 °C (78 °F) or higher. Efficiency analyses should account for behavioral heterogeneity as well as variations in climate and housing characteristics. We model energy and economic savings of efficiency upgrades for U.S. single-family detached houses, accounting for differences in thermostat settings, climate zone, fuel prices, and home characteristics. We consider five efficiency interventions: wall insulation, attic insulation, air sealing, high-efficiency furnaces, and high-efficiency air conditioners. Energy and economic savings vary widely by consumer; the average net present value for wall insulation is $3,020 United States Dollar (USD), but considering heterogeneity, it has a 10th percentile value of -$231 and 90th percentile value of $5,000. Neglecting heterogeneity, technology upgrades can be prioritized from lower to higher carbon abatement costs: air conditioners, wall insulation, furnace, air sealing, and attic insulation. Accounting for heterogeneity reorders this prioritization, and consumer-specific conditions affect mitigation costs such that technologies are mixed in with one another and are no longer arranged one after another. These results indicate that interventions to improve efficiency should consider differences between consumers.","Elsevier","","National Renewable Energy Lab.

"Prototype energy models for data centers","Sun, Kaiyu; Luo, Na; Luo, Xuan; Hong, Tianzhen","32 ENERGY CONSERVATION, CONSUMPTION, AND UTILIZATION; data center; EnergyPlus; energy efficiency; prototype energy model; approach temperature; OpenStudio","Data centers in the United States consume about two percent of the nation’s electricity. Because heat gains from IT equipment drive cooling demand, data centers offer unique opportunities for energy savings. However, no prototype energy model for data centers is available in the suite of existing U.S. Department of Energy’s Commercial Prototype Building Models. Here we present the development of two new data center prototype models and their implementation in OpenStudio and EnergyPlus. The small-size data center model represents a computer room in a building served by computer room air conditioners (CRACs); while the large-sized model represents stand-alone data centers served by computer room air handlers (CRAHs) with a central chiller plant. For each data center model, two levels of IT equipment (ITE) load density were considered, to cover the wide range of IT power density of data centers: 40 and 100 W/ft<sup>2</sup> (430 and 1076 W/m<sup>2</sup>) for the computer room, and 100 and 500 W/ft<sup>2</sup> (1076 and 5382 W/m<sup>2</sup>) for the stand-alone data center. All other assumptions, such as building envelope, lighting, HVAC efficiencies and schedules, were based on the minimal requirements of ASHRAE Standard 90.1 at various vintages. We introduced a novel concept of supply and return air approach temperatures to capture the essential effects of non-uniform airflow and temperature distribution in data centers. The approach temperatures were pre-computed by computational fluid dynamics (CFD) simulations for various configurations of ITE loads and airflow containment management in data centers. A new feature was developed in EnergyPlus to implement the approach temperature method. A case study was conducted to demonstrate the use of the data center models. The two data center models cover all U.S. climate zones and can be used to evaluate energy saving measures for data centers, as well as to support development of data center energy efficiency codes and standards.","Elsevier","","Lawrence Berkeley National Lab.

"An open source fast fluid dynamics model for data center thermal management","Han, Xu; Tian, Wei; VanGilder, Jim; Zuo, Wangda; Faulkner, Cary","32 ENERGY CONSERVATION, CONSUMPTION, AND UTILIZATION; Data Center; Airflow and Thermal Management; Fast Fluid Dynamics; Model-Based Design and Operation","Although computational fluid dynamics (CFD) has been widely adopted to improve data center thermal management, the high computational demand limits its applications, such as multivariate optimal design and operation. Fast fluid dynamics (FFD), which has been applied for fast airflow simulation, shows great potential. However, few research applied FFD for optimal design and operation of data center thermal management. This research improves the FFD model for data centers and conducts a comprehensive evaluation and demonstration. First, the FFD model is improved by solving the advection and diffusion equations together using an upwind scheme instead of a semi-Lagrangian advection solver in the conventional FFD model. Second, new features for data centers are added, such as a pressure correction method to simulate plenum airflow and dynamic boundary conditions for IT racks. The new FFD model is first validated with two indoor environment cases and the results show that the new FFD model has slightly better overall prediction accuracy and faster speed compared to the conventional FFD model. It is also observed that both FFD models achieve acceptable accuracy, except for a few localized disparities with experimental data, which might be due to simplified handling of turbulence viscosity near the boundaries. Furthermore, validation with a real data center shows that the FFD model achieves a similar level of accuracy as CFD when compared to the experimental measurements with some level of uncertainties. It is then demonstrated for data center optimal design and operation, which saves 53.4–58.8% of annual energy while still meeting the thermal requirements. In conclusion, with a much faster speed and comparable accuracy compared to CFD, the FFD model parallelized on a graphics processing unit is promising for practical model-based data center early design and operation.","Elsevier","","Univ. of Colorado, Boulder, CO (United States)","USDOE Office of Energy Efficiency and Renewable Energy (EERE), Energy Efficiency Office.

Due to the lack of a systematic understanding on how these parameters affect the control performance, they are usually selected arbitrarily in practice. In this paper, the combined impacts of selected time intervals for model discretization and control sampling on the performance of model predictive control are comprehensively investigated for the first time through detailed simulations. The simulation results reveal that the time interval for model discretization has a much greater influence on the performance of model predictive control than that for control sampling by affecting the prediction performance, cost saving, and computation time simultaneously. In particular, there are three findings on the time interval for model discretization that are specific to the case studies considered herein. First, it affects the performance of multi-period prediction in a non-linear manner so that it is not always better to have a smaller time interval for model discretization. Second, it has four times greater influence on the resulting cost saving from model predictive control than the time interval for control sampling. Last, it affects the computation time significantly. The increase of the time interval for model discretization from 1 min to 5 min can reduce the computation time by roughly 96%. Overall, the proposed simulation-based performance evaluation sheds light on the importance of selecting appropriate time intervals for practical applications of model predictive control to building energy management.","Elsevier","","National Renewable Energy Lab.

There is a gap in the literature related to comparing various time–frequency-analysis techniques, especially discrete wavelet transform (DWT) and empirical mode decomposition (EMD), to guide the selection and tuning of time–frequency-analysis techniques in data-driven building load forecasting. This article provides a framework to conduct a comprehensive comparison among thirteen DWT/EMD techniques with various parameters in a load forecasting modeling task. A real campus building is used as a case study for illustration. The DWT and EMD techniques are also compared under various data-driven modeling algorithms for building load forecasting. The results in the case study show that the load forecasting models trained with noise-cancelled energy data have increased their accuracy to 9.6% on average tested under unseen data. This study also shows that the effectiveness of DWT/EMD techniques depends on the data-driven algorithms used for load forecasting modeling and the training data. Hence, DWT/EMD-based noise cancellation needs customized selection and tuning to optimize their performance for data-driven building load forecasting modeling.","Elsevier","","National Renewable Energy Lab.

"Data-driven evaluation of HVAC operation and savings in commercial buildings","Khalilnejad, Arash; French, Roger H.; Abramson, Alexis R.","32 ENERGY CONSERVATION, CONSUMPTION, AND UTILIZATION; Building energy; HVAC; Data analysis; Energy savings; Time series","Commercial buildings consumed 36% of electricity, or 1.35 trillion kWh, in the United States in 2017, and almost 30% of this energy was wasted. Much of this loss can be attributed to inefficient heating ventilation and air con­ditioning (HVAC) systems. By improving the operational conditions of HVAC, significant savings can be achieved. However, most buildings and building equipment do not use costly sub-meters to monitor and address performance issues, and on-site auditing can be expensive and insufficient. Alternatively in this study, we propose a data-driven method to identify savings opportunities using only whole building meter data and without setting foot in the building. For this purpose, we introduced two algorithms that virtually quantify the value of a thermostat setpoint setback and HVAC rescheduling. Additionally, we developed novel methods for detecting occupancy patterns and quantifying the baseload of the HVAC operation. Using a clustering algorithm, we identified those buildings for which HVAC savings was significant and further categorized the buildings based on their potential for savings. A population study of over 432 commercial buildings demonstrated a median percentage energy savings of 1.6% from a baseload reduction and 2.1% from HVAC rescheduling. Additionally, results indicate that retail buildings have the highest potential for savings among the building types studied.","Elsevier","","Case Western Reserve Univ., Cleveland, OH (United States)","USDOE Advanced Research Projects Agency - Energy (ARPA-E)","","United States","2020-11-01T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: Applied Energy; Journal Volume: 278","","Medium: ED; Size: Article No. 115505","","","AR0000668; AR-0000668","Journal ID: ISSN 0306-2619","10.1016/j.apenergy.2020.115505","","2021-11-01T00:00:00Z","1782098","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/1782098","https://www.osti.gov/servlets/purl/1782098","Applied Energy","","278"

Also unknown is what fraction of outdoor light emissions and associated energy use are due to public light sources (i.e. streetlights) or various types of private light sources (e.g. advertising). Here we show that it is possible to measure the contribution of street lighting to nighttime satellite imagery using ‘smart city’ lighting infrastructure. The city of Tucson, USA, intentionally altered its streetlight output over 10 days, and we examined the change in emissions observed by satellite. We find that streetlights operated by the city are responsible for only 13% of the total radiance (in the 500–900 nm band) observed from Tucson from space after midnight (95% confidence interval 10–16%). If Tucson did not dim their streetlights after midnight, the contribution would be 18% (95% confidence interval 15–23%). When streetlights operated by other actors are included, the best estimates rise to 16% and 21%, respectively.

"Energy and Exergy Analysis of Low-Global Warming Potential Refrigerants as Replacement for R410A in Two-Speed Heat Pumps for Cold Climates","Shen, Bo; Ally, Moonis R.","32 ENERGY CONSERVATION, CONSUMPTION, AND UTILIZATION; low-GWP refrigerants; modeling; heat pumps; simulation; exergy; cold climate","Heat pumps (HPs) are being developed with a new emphasis on cold climates. To lower the environmental impact of greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions, alternate low global warming potential (GWP) refrigerants must also replace the exclusive use of the refrigerant R410A, preferably without re-engineering the mechanical hardware. In this paper, we analyze the performance of four low-GWP alternative refrigerants (R32, R452B, R454B, and R466A) relative to the conventional R410A and draw conclusions on the relative performances for providing heating in cold climates based on the Air-Conditioning, Heating, and Refrigeration Institute (AHRI) 210/240 standard for two-speed heat pumps. The simulations are carried using the Department of Energy, Oak Ridge National Laboratory (DOE/ORNL) Heat Pump Design Model (HPDM), a well-known heating, ventilation, and air conditioning (HVAC) modeling and design tool in the public domain and the HVAC research and development community. The results of the simulation are further scrutinized using exergy analysis to identify sources of systemic inefficiency, the root cause of lost work. This rigorous approach provides an exhaustive analysis of alternate low-GWP refrigerants to replace R410A using available compressors and system components, without compromising performance.","MDPI AG","","Oak Ridge National Lab.

"Impact of installation faults in air conditioners and heat pumps in single-family homes on U.S. energy usage","Winkler, Jonathan; Das, Saptarshi; Earle, Lieko; Burkett, Lena; Robertson, Joe; Roberts, Dave; Booten, Chuck","32 ENERGY CONSERVATION, CONSUMPTION, AND UTILIZATION; air conditioner; building energy simulation; fault; heat pump; installation quality","To ensure that new residential air conditioners and heat pumps operate optimally, care must be taken during the initial system design and installation to avoid missteps that immediately degrade a system’s performance. Laboratory and simulation studies have quantified the impact that faults can have on capacity and efficiency. Field studies have demonstrated that installation-related faults are commonplace. However, the national impact of installation-related faults cannot be accurately estimated by only simulating a limited number of homes at several fault levels because of the variety of home characteristics and climates involved. In our analysis, we use an improved residential building stock simulation tool to predict the annual energy increase and additional utility costs resulting from two common installation faults: indoor airflow rate and refrigerant charge level. Our method considers the wide range of building characteristics and climate zones of the U.S. housing stock. We use existing field data to develop fault intensity probability distributions to inform our analysis. The study shows that these two faults result in approximately 20.7 TWh/y of additional energy use for central air conditioners and air-source heat pumps in U.S. single-family detached homes, which is a 9% increase over baseline (no-fault) usage, costing homeowners approximately $2.5 billion annually on utility bills. Air-source heat pumps are responsible for a disproportionate fraction of this energy use increase because of the larger number of operating hours compared to central air conditioners and the sensitivity of heating mode performance to the faults analyzed compared to cooling mode.","Elsevier","","National Renewable Energy Lab.

The proposed control architecture distributes the computational effort and is easier to be scaled up than traditional centralized control. The decentralized control architecture consists of two layers: The community operator layer (COL) allocates the limited amount of renewable energy resource according to the power flexibility of each building. The building agent layer (BAL) addresses the optimal load scheduling problem for each building with the allowable load determined by the COL. Both layers are formulated as a model predictive control (MPC) based optimization. Simulation scenarios are designed to compare different combinations of building weighting methods and objective functions to provide guidance for real-world deployment by community and microgrid operators. The results indicate that the impact of power flexibility is more prominent than the weighting factor to the resource allocation process. Allocation based purely on occupancy status could lead to an increase of PV curtailment. Further, it is necessary for the building agent to have multi-objective optimization to minimize unserved load ratio and maximize comfort simultaneously.</jats:p>","MDPI AG","","Pacific Northwest National Lab.

Here, we report SOT switching of synthetic antiferromagnetic and ferrimagnetic Co/Ir/Co trilayers, where the net magnetization and the interlayer coupling strength are highly controllable. Here, a weak external field dependence of the SOT switching was observed due to the robust domain wall structure in the trilayer. The switching current density was observed to scale inversely with the net magnetization. For trilayers with the same net magnetization, switching current is independent of the layer order because switching in the thicker Co layer dominates. In both ferromagnetic and antiferromagetic regimes, the switching current reflects the interlayer coupling strength.","American Institute of Physics (AIP)","","Johns Hopkins Univ., Baltimore, MD (United States)","USDOE Office of Science (SC), Basic Energy Sciences (BES); KAUST","","United States","2020-10-27T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: Applied Physics Letters; Journal Volume: 117; Journal Issue: 17","","Medium: ED; Size: Article No. 172403","","","SC0009390; OSR2017-CRG6-3427.01","Journal ID: ISSN 0003-6951; TRN: US2204141","10.1063/5.0024724","","2022-06-28T00:00:00Z","1690155","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/1690155","https://www.osti.gov/servlets/purl/1690155","Applied Physics Letters","17","117"

"Reducing ridesourcing empty vehicle travel with future travel demand prediction","Kontou, Eleftheria; Garikapati, Venu; Hou, Yi","32 ENERGY CONSERVATION, CONSUMPTION, AND UTILIZATION; ridesourcing; travel demand; deadheading; prediction","Ridesourcing services provide alternative mobility options in several cities. Their market share has grown exponentially due to the convenience they provide. The use of such services may be associated with car-light or car-free lifestyles. However, there are growing concerns regarding their impact on urban transportation operations performance due to empty, unproductive miles driven without a passenger (commonly referred to as deadheading). This paper is motivated by the potential to reduce deadhead mileage of ridesourcing trips by providing drivers with information on future ridesourcing trip demand. Future demand information enables the driver to wait in place for the next rider’s request without cruising around and contributing to congestion. A machine learning model is employed to predict hourly and 10-minute future interval travel demand for ridesourcing at a given location. Using future demand information, we propose algorithms to (i) assign drivers to act on received demand information by waiting in place for the next rider, and (ii) match these drivers with riders to minimize deadheading distance. Real-world data from ridesourcing providers in Austin, TX (RideAustin) and Chengdu, China (DiDi Chuxing) are leveraged. Results show that this process achieves 68%–82% and 53%–60% reduction of trip-level deadheading miles for the RideAustin and DiDi Chuxing sample operations respectively, under the assumption of unconstrained availability of short-term parking. Deadheading savings increase slightly as the maximum tolerable waiting time for the driver increases. Further, it is observed that significant deadhead savings per trip are possible, even when a small percent of the ridesourcing driver pool is provided with future ridesourcing demand information.","Elsevier","","National Renewable Energy Lab.

Travel-based multitasking has an indisputable influence on offering a pleasant travel experience to transit users during their rides, given that they can use their travel time to perform desirable activities and gain benefits in various form. For instance, the in-activities could help the rider free up time from his/her schedule for the day (i.e., a worthwhile use of travel time). In this study, we investigate how the worthwhileness of a travel-based multitasking could be under the influence of: (1) the transit user’s lifestyle, and (2) socio-demographics, and (3) the characteristics of the transit trip. Towards this, we conducted an intercept survey focusing on the transit trips in the Chicago metropolitan area and analyzed it using latent class modeling approach. Per the results, two classes of transit users could be identified: (1) worthwhileness seekers, productively travelers and (2) leisure seekers, occasional worthwhile travelers. The results also suggest travel time, waiting time and walking distance to the transit station, and the set of in-vehicle activities as significant predictors of worthwhile use of travel time. Finally, the findings provide insights to policymakers for improving public transit systems in the current form, as well as designing an autonomous mobility system as the future form of public transit.","Elsevier","","Argonne National Lab.

Results found that ZEB definition, energy drivers, standard, regional policies, technology adoption and their adoption ratio determine the energy performance of cases. Not all EU and China cases reach the net-zero energy target; however, most ZEBs in the US do. ZEBs in cold regions adopted multiple technologies to achieve high energy-efficiency. Further, the adoption ratio of passive technologies is higher than that of active technologies, especially in China. The active technologies in cold regions are mainly seen in the application of advanced HVAC systems. Such application of renewable technologies exhibits strong regional characteristics; for example, the EU's carbon emission reduction policies promoted the use of biomass-based technologies. The analysis also found that energy policies greatly enhance the development of ZEBs. Overall, achieving zero energy is a process, not an endpoint and many projects need further refinement after occupancy.","Elsevier","","Lawrence Berkeley National Lab.

However, missing data is one of the major data quality issues, making data imputation techniques become increasingly important. There are two key research gaps for missing sensor data imputation in buildings: the lack of customized and automated imputation methodology, and the difficulty of the validation of data imputation methods. In this paper, a framework is developed to address these two gaps. First, a validation data generation module is developed based on pattern recognition to create a validation dataset to quantify the performance of data imputation methods. Second, a pool of data imputation methods is tested under the validation dataset to find an optimal single imputation method for each sensor, which is termed as an ensemble method. The method can reflect the specific mechanism and randomness of missing data from each sensor. The effectiveness of the framework is demonstrated by 18 sensors from a real campus building. The overall accuracy of data imputation for those sensors improves by 18.2% on average compared with the best single data imputation method.","MDPI AG","","National Renewable Energy Lab.

"Development and Evaluation of Occupancy-Aware HVAC Control for Residential Building Energy Efficiency and Occupant Comfort","Turley, Christina; Jacoby, Margarite; Pavlak, Gregory; Henze, Gregor","32 ENERGY CONSERVATION, CONSUMPTION, AND UTILIZATION; HVAC control; occupancy prediction; energy consumption; thermal comfort","Occupancy-aware heating, ventilation, and air conditioning (HVAC) control offers the opportunity to reduce energy use without sacrificing thermal comfort. Residential HVAC systems often use manually-adjusted or constant setpoint temperatures, which heat and cool the house regardless of whether it is needed. By incorporating occupancy-awareness into HVAC control, heating and cooling can be used for only those time periods it is needed. Yet, bringing this technology to fruition is dependent on accurately predicting occupancy. Non-probabilistic prediction models offer an opportunity to use collected occupancy data to predict future occupancy profiles. Smart devices, such as a connected thermostat, which already include occupancy sensors, can be used to provide a continually growing collection of data that can then be harnessed for short-term occupancy prediction by compiling and creating a binary occupancy prediction. Real occupancy data from six homes located in Colorado is analyzed and investigated using this occupancy prediction model. Results show that non-probabilistic occupancy models in combination with occupancy sensors can be combined to provide a hybrid HVAC control with savings on average of 5.0% and without degradation of thermal comfort. Model predictive control provides further opportunities, with the ability to adjust the relative importance between thermal comfort and energy savings to achieve savings between 1% and 13.3% depending on the relative weighting between thermal comfort and energy savings. In all cases, occupancy prediction allows the opportunity for a more intelligent and optimized strategy to residential HVAC control.","MDPI AG","","National Renewable Energy Lab.

The S4T comprises two reverse-blocking current-source inverter (CSI) bridges, auxiliary branches for ZVS, and transformer magnetizing inductor as a reduced dc link with 60% ripple. Compared with the prior S4T, an effective change on the leakage inductance diode is made to reduce the number of the devices on the main power path by 20% for significant conduction loss saving and retain the same functionality of damping the resonance between the leakage and resonant capacitors and recycling trapped leakage energy. The conduction loss saving is crucial, being the dominating loss mechanism in SSTs. Importantly, the proposed single-stage SST not only holds the potential for high power density and high efficiency but also has full functionality, e.g., multiport dc loads integration, voltage regulation, and reactive power compensation, unlike the traditional single-stage matrix SST. The S4T can achieve single-stage isolated bidirectional dc–dc, ac–dc, dc–ac, or ac–ac conversion. It can also be configured input-series output-parallel (ISOP) in a modular way for medium-voltage (MV) grids. Hence, the S4T is a promising candidate for the SST. The full functionality, e.g., voltage buck–boost, multiport, etc., and the universality of the S4T for the dc–dc, dc–ac, and ac–ac conversion are verified through the simulations and experiments of two-port and three-port MV prototypes based on 3.3 kV SiC MOSFETs in dc–dc, dc–ac, and ac–ac modes at 2 kV.","IEEE","","Georgia Institute of Technology, Atlanta, GA (United States)","USDOE Advanced Research Projects Agency - Energy (ARPA-E)","","United States","2020-10-13T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: IEEE Transactions on Power Electronics; Journal Volume: 36; Journal Issue: 5","","Medium: ED; Size: p. 5236-5249","","","AR0000899","Journal ID: ISSN 0885-8993","10.1109/tpel.2020.3030795","","2022-11-07T00:00:00Z","1892476","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/1892476","https://www.osti.gov/servlets/purl/1892476","IEEE Transactions on Power Electronics","5","36"

Two incentive-based DR methods and four price-based DR schemes — real time pricing (RTP), time-of-use (TOU) rates, critical peak prices (CPP), and variable peak prices (VPP) — are analyzed. Load reduction potential is evaluated for scenarios where the home has both onsite solar and storage, only solar, and no solar or storage. Results show that, from the utility’s perspective, the optimal load control schemes, which result in greatest reduction in peak load and energy consumption from the grid during peak hours, are CPP and VPP (critical price option). By considering the combined effect of demand response, solar generation, and energy storage systems, this study aims to equip electric utilities with the ability to make decisions about dynamic rate design and direct load control to curtail peak demand and shift energy usage.","","","Univ. of Texas, Austin, TX (United States)","USDOE Office of Energy Efficiency and Renewable Energy (EERE), Renewable Power Office.

Tenant fit-out presents a key opportunity to incorporate energy efficiency within the real estate business cycle. We designed a package of energy efficiency measures tailored to the scope of a tenant fit-out. This tenant fit-out package (TFP) includes advanced lighting and heating, ventilating and air-conditioning (HVAC) controls as core measures, with ceiling fans, automated shading, and plug load controls as additional optional measures. We conducted laboratory testing of six configurations of the package to evaluate energy savings, indoor environmental quality, and identify installation, commissioning, and operational issues. Combined savings for HVAC, lighting, and plug loads ranged from 33–40%. Lighting savings ranged from 69–83%, and HVAC savings from 20–40%. The laboratory testing also revealed some minor but tractable challenges with installation and commissioning of HVAC controls. Overall, the results demonstrate that significant savings can be realized in existing office buildings by incorporating relatively low-risk, proven measures at the time of a tenant fit-out.</p>","MDPI AG","","Lawrence Berkeley National Lab.

The control-oriented building model was developed with a grey-box model structure based on the experimental data to predict the indoor air temperature. Based on the model, the operation cost-saving potential of the MPC was investigated in a single house with different comfort levels, electricity prices, and prediction horizons. The cost-saving of the MPC was approximately 10.6 % compared to the conventional control. The MPC was expanded to a residential building cluster considering the peak demand charge. In an hourly shedding and load-up scenario, the performances of the MPC and the heuristic prior-based control (PBC) are promising. When shedding was enforced all day, the peak demand saving of the MPC was 36~38 %, whereas that of the PBC was 25.7 % compared to the baseline. In addition, the monthly electricity bill, including the operation and peak demand cost, was investigated with different demand charge rates and weather conditions. The total saving decreased with a low demand charge rate and hot conditions, and the operation cost saving was compromised with more aggressive demand shedding.","Elseiver","","Oak Ridge National Lab.

After decades of weatherization and bill-payment programs, low-income households still spend a higher percent of their income on electricity and gas bills than any other income group. Their energy burden is not declining, and it remains persistently high in particular geographies such as the South, rural America, and minority communities. As public agencies and utilities attempt to transition to a sustainable energy future, many of the programs that promote energy efficiency, rooftop solar, electric vehicles, and home batteries are largely inaccessible to low-income households due to affordability barriers. This review describes the ecosystem of stakeholders and programs, and identifies promising opportunities to address low-income energy affordability, such as behavioral economics, data analytics, and leveraging health care benefits. Scalable approaches require linking programs and policies to tackle the complex web of causes and impacts faced by financially constrained households.","IOP Publishing","","Oak Ridge National Lab.

"Intra-node high-performance computing network architecture with nanosecond-scale photonic switches","Maniotis, Pavlos; Dupuis, Nicolas; Schares, Laurent; Kuchta, Daniel M.; Taubenblatt, Marc A.; Lee, Benjamin G.","99 GENERAL AND MISCELLANEOUS; 32 ENERGY CONSERVATION, CONSUMPTION, AND UTILIZATION","We propose a single-stage network architecture for intra-node connectivity that makes use of nanosecond-scale photonic switches. Although buffering at the switch points is of vital importance for complex multi-stage networks, this is not the case for smaller-scale single-stage networks where the end nodes are located only one hop apart. By limiting the buffering to the end points, the proposed architecture manages to minimize the required electro-optic and opto-electronic conversions, leading in this way to both low end-to-end latency and better energy efficiency. Combining these advantages with nanosecond-scale switching times can allow for high-throughput operation even for frequent switch reconfigurations. The performance of the proposed architecture is evaluated via discrete-event simulations for a wide range of synthetic-traffic cases. The simulation results show that high-throughput operation of ≥90% can be achieved even for small message sizes, i.e., 32 KB for all-to-all communication and 2 KB for uniform random traffic, at a data rate of 400 Gb/s and a switch reconfiguration time of ≤72 ns. Moreover, if 100-ns reconfiguration times are achievable as opposed to 150-ns, then for the all-to-all traffic case a 16% and 28% reduction in completion time can be achieved for message sizes of 8 KB and 1 KB, respectively. In a forthcoming era of optically interfaced processors and accelerators, nanosecond-scale photonic switches appear as a highly promising solution for keeping up with the intra-node bandwidth scaling due to their high-bandwidth, low-latency and fast-switching capabilities.","IEEE / Optical Society of America (OSA)","","IBM Thomas J.

"Modeling the External Effects of Air Taxis in Reducing the Energy Consumption of Road Traffic","Lin, Zhenhong; Xie, Fei; Ou, Shiqi (Shawn)","32 ENERGY CONSERVATION, CONSUMPTION, AND UTILIZATION","Air taxis are currently being demonstrated. Few studies have quantified their external effects in reducing on-road vehicle fuel consumption. The hypothesis of this paper is that air taxis may divert some drivers away from congested traffic corridors, improve traffic speed and fuel economy, and reduce congestion-induced energy consumption. A model is developed that links several key components: mode choice, the relationship between travel demand and traffic speeds, the relationship between traffic speeds and fuel economies, and the heterogenous value of travel time. It is applied to the route from downtown Los Angeles to Los Angeles International Airport, where at peak hours 38,200 vehicles attempt to use the route that has an hourly capacity of 17,200 vehicles. The model estimates that, with conservative assumptions and near-term technologies, diverting 3.2% of the traffic to air taxis could produce a 15% reduction in traffic vehicle fuel use. With optimistic assumptions and mature technologies, the study estimates that diverting 20% of traffic could reduce the traffic vehicle fuel use by about 74%. The key insight is that if a small share of congested travelers switched to air taxis, motivated by private benefits of time savings, significant external benefits for other road travelers (time savings and fuel savings) and to society (reduced energy use and emissions), would ensue creating a win-win-win outcome. Overall, these estimates (which are not intended as predictions because of the stated limitations) strongly suggest the need to consider the external energy effect in future cost-benefit analyses of air taxi technologies.","SAGE","","Oak Ridge National Lab.

"A systematic feature extraction and selection framework for data-driven whole-building automated fault detection and diagnostics in commercial buildings","Zhang, Liang; Frank, Stephen; Kim, Janghyun; Jin, Xin; Leach, Matt","32 ENERGY CONSERVATION, CONSUMPTION, AND UTILIZATION; whole building; AFDD; statistical feature extraction; feature selection; commercial buildings; automated fault detection and diagnostics","In data-driven automated fault detection and diagnostics (AFDD) modeling for building energy systems, feature engineering is a critical process of extracting information from high-dimensional and noisy sensor measurement and turning it into informative and representative inputs or features for data-driven modeling. However, few studies specifically discuss the feature engineering, especially the interactions between feature extraction and feature selection in whole-building AFDD. We developed a systematic feature extraction and selection framework for whole-building AFDD. In this framework, features are aggressively extracted from raw sensor data using statistical feature extraction techniques with various window sizes and statistics. With many features extracted, a hybrid feature selection algorithm that combines the filter and wrapper method then selects the best feature set. The framework considers diversity in the duration of fault behavior among fault types in whole-building AFDD, thus achieving high model generalization. We implemented our developed framework in a virtual testbed calibrated with measured data from Oak Ridge National Laboratory's Flexible Research Platform designed to mimic the operation of a typical small commercial building. The AFDD model is trained by the simulation data generated from the virtual testbed. The results show that (1) the developed framework improves the generalization of the AFDD model by 10.7% compared with literature-reported feature extraction and selection methods and (2) features with diverse window sizes and statistics are selected, providing insight into physical systems beyond the current understanding of buildings and faults and improving the detection and diagnostics of multiple fault types.","Elsevier","","National Renewable Energy Lab.

This paper deals with the problem of simultaneously identifying an aggregate thermal dynamic model and unknown disturbances from input–output data of multi-zone buildings. The unknown disturbance is a key challenge since it is not measurable but non-negligible. In this paper, we first present a principled method to aggregate a multi-zone building model into a single zone model, and show the aggregation is not as trivial as it has been assumed in the prior art. We then provide a method to identify the parameters of the model and the unknown disturbance for this aggregate (single-zone) model. Finally, we test our proposed identification algorithm to data collected from a multi-zone building testbed in Oak Ridge National Laboratory. A key insight provided by the aggregation method allows us to recognize under what conditions the estimation of the disturbance signal will be necessarily poor and uncertain, even in the case of a specially designed test in which the disturbances affecting each zone are known (as the case of our experimental testbed). This insight is used to provide a heuristic that can be used to assess when the identification results are likely to have high or low accuracy.","Elsevier","","Oak Ridge National Lab.

Understanding the synergies and trade-offs in the FEW nexus, and how these interconnections impact earth’s systems, is critical to ensure adequate access to these resources in the future; an essential component for achieving the Sustainable Development Goals (Scanlon et al., 2017). Although, over the last decade, the identification of FEW nexus complexities has increased at a global (IPCC, 2018; D’Orodico et al., 2018), national (Lant et al., 2019), and city scale (Rushforth and Ruddell, 2018), these findings are yet to be adequately translated into ‘on the ground’ action due a lack of technical and political capacity (Weitz et al., 2017). Specifically, local FEW systems have been overlooked in these analyses (Scanlon et al., 2017; Lant et al., 2019), thus leaving small and medium towns vulnerable due to a lack of data and inadequate FEW system management. Building on three years of field-tested FEW nexus research in the Ruddell Lab, we argue that participatory citizen science projects, such as our FEWSION for Community Resilience initiative, can bridge the data-policy gaps that exist within local FEW system management by: 1) providing last mile data on the FEW system, and 2) translating local data into evidence-based solutions at a grassroots level. Thus, we present a broadly applicable framework and call to action for local scale participatory citizen science to solve complex FEW nexus issues at a local, regional, and national scale.","Frontiers Research Foundation","","Argonne National Lab.

However, more exploration is needed on understanding the adaptability challenges that the DRL agent could face during the deployment phase. Using online learning for such applications is not realistic due to the long learning period and likely poor comfort control during the learning process. Alternatively, DRL can be pre-trained using a building model prior to deployment. However, developing an accurate building model for every house and deploying a pre-trained DRL model for HVAC control would not be cost-effective. In this study, we focus on evaluating the ability of DRL-based HVAC control to provide cost savings when pre-trained on one building model and deployed on different house models with varying user comforts. We observed around 30% of cost reduction by pre-trained model over baseline when validated in a simulation environment and achieved up to 21% cost reduction when deployed in the real house. This finding provides experimental evidence that the pre-trained DRL has the potential to adapt to different house environments and comfort settings.","MDPI","","Oak Ridge National Lab.

Despite this fact and increased research activity in this field, the application of MPC in practice is still in its early stages. There are multiple reasons why. In particular, an MPC design is not trivial and requires an accurate control-oriented model of the building. Moreover, MPC implementation imposes increased requirements regarding communication infrastructure, computational power, and dedicated software tools. All these features make the implementation of MPC in real buildings an engineering challenge requiring a team of experts with a background in physics-based modeling, advanced control theory, optimization, and communication technologies. There is a growing need for multidisciplinary education and a unified framework for MPC in the built environment to be accessible for a broad range of researchers and practitioners with different engineering backgrounds. This paper provides a unified framework for model predictive building control technology with focus on the real-world application, reviewing the topic from both control and building engineering perspectives. From a theoretical point of view, this paper presents an overview of MPC formulations for building control, modeling paradigms and model types, together with algorithms necessary for real-life implementation. The paper categorizes the most notable MPC problem classes, links them with corresponding solution techniques, and provides an overview of methods for mitigation of the uncertainties for increased performance and robustness of MPC. From a practical point of view, this paper delivers an elaborate classification of the most important modeling, co-simulation, optimal control design, and optimization techniques, tools, and solvers suitable to tackle the MPC problems in the context of building climate control. On top of this, the paper presents the essential components of a practical implementation of MPC such as different control architectures and nuances of communication infrastructures within supervisory control and data acquisition (SCADA) systems. The paper draws practical guidelines with a generic workflow for implementation of MPC in real buildings aimed for contemporary adopters of this technology. Finally, the importance of standardized performance assessment and methodology for comparison of different building control algorithms is discussed.","International Federation of Automatic Control - Elsevier","","Lawrence Berkeley National Lab.

Advanced energy analytics applications—including fault detection and diagnostics and supervisory control—have emerged as a significant opportunity for improving the performance of our built environment. Effective application of these analytics depends on harnessing structured data from the various building control and monitoring systems, but typical BAS implementations do not employ any standardized metadata schema. While standards such as Project Haystack and Brick Schema have been developed to address this issue, the process of structuring the data, i.e., tagging the points to apply a standard metadata schema, has, to date, been a manual process. This process is typically costly, labor-intensive, and error-prone. In this work we address this gap by proposing a UA that automates the process of point tagging by leveraging the data accessible through connection to the BAS, including time-series data and the raw point names. The UA intertwines supervised classification and unsupervised clustering techniques from machine learning and leverages both their deterministic and probabilistic outputs to inform the point tagging process. Furthermore, we extend the UA to embed additional input and output data-processing modules that are designed to address the challenges associated with the real-time deployment of this automation solution. We test the UA on two datasets for real-life buildings: (i) commercial retail buildings and (ii) office buildings from the National Renewable Energy Laboratory (NREL) campus. We report the proposed methodology correctly applied 85–90% and 70–75% of the tags in each of these test scenarios, respectively for two significantly different building types used for testing UA's fully-functional prototype. The proposed UA, therefore, offers promising approach for automatically tagging BAS data as it reaches close to 90% accuracy. Further building upon this framework to algorithmically identify the equipment type and their relationships is an apt future research direction to pursue.","Elsevier","","National Renewable Energy Lab.

"Data-driven occupant-behavior analytics for residential buildings","Sun, Yannan; Hao, Weituo; Chen, Yan; Liu, Bing","32 ENERGY CONSERVATION, CONSUMPTION, AND UTILIZATION; data-driven; machine learning; occupant behavior; residential buildings; incentive evaluation","Many advances have been made in building technology to help save energy, but influencing the behavior of the occupants is still necessary to achieve low-energy use targets. One of the most practical ways to influence and change occupant behaviors is through incentives. Developing incentives for energy-saving and quantifying the impact of occupant behaviors are both active areas of research. Here, we propose a data analytics framework for detecting changes in occupant behaviors, which will help build an analytics feedback loop from behavior impact to incentive design. The framework has two major parts. The first forecasts energy consumption for each occupant, while the second determines a probability distribution for changes in energy consumption. The parts are interchangeable with other existing machine learning and statistical methods. A specific instantiation of the framework, using kernel ridge-regression for forecasting and k-means to find an empirical behavior distribution, is described in detail. An HVAC use-case with 5 different incentivized behaviors is used as an example to show that the framework can detect behavior changes induced by incentives. Furthermore, we show that some simpler behavior-change detection methods do not work, further justifying the use of advanced analytics.","Elsevier","","Pacific Northwest National Lab.

The European market for wood pellets used in small-scale heating systems has been expanding significantly over the past decade. Small scale pellet heating is arguably a mature technology, but whether the market is mature is another question. In this paper we analyse recent data on trade flows and price developments between Italy, Austria, Germany and France to understand the developments of wood pellet market efficiency and to draw conclusions about market function. The objective of this study is to establish a framework to test the European residential wood pellet market for competitive spatial equilibrium using modern trade theory.

However, when operated in the field, these units operate often at very low loads causing them to cycle. In this study, the performance of a 25-kW modern pellet boiler under emulated field conditions and fixed nominal loads of 15% and 100% has been studied in a lab—with and without a buffer tank. A dilution tunnel approach was used for the measurement of particulate emissions, in accordance with U.S. certification testing requirements under EPA Methods 28 WHH and 28 WHH PTS. Results show that increasing the amount of thermal storage used decreases cycling rates leading to decreased emissions and increased efficiency. Without thermal storage, integrated efficiency over a 15% load test period was 57%, compared to 74% when thermal storage was used. Particulate emissions were 180 mg/MJ and 64 mg/MJ for the 15% load case without and with thermal storage, respectively.","American Chemical Society (ACS)","","Brookhaven National Lab.

This consumption is based on the building’s load component types, efficiencies, and how they consume power and react to changes in real time. Due to this complexity, standard full-building load models are typically voltage-invariant. This paper proposes a novel framework to transform these voltage-invariant building load models into fully time- and voltage-dependent load profiles using available data on the voltage sensitivity of individual load components. While a voltage-dependent building model could theoretically be generated from static load models of every component in a building, this approach faces two challenges: first, load models representing all load components are impractical to develop for all possible load component types; second, building energy consumption is never measured or modeled at the individual component level. The proposed framework compiles available component data in the form of static ZIP load model parameters, and maps them into the end use categories utilized by standard building modeling programs. The voltage sensitivity of each end use category is then bounded by the extrema of the component models within it. This framework is applied to a load profile case study representing the aggregate U.S. residential building stock. In addition to the minimum/maximum conditions, a load profile based on typical load composition and weighted ZIP parameters is generated for the same building stock. The results show that for a 10% drop in voltage, using the least sensitive ZIP parameters, active power is expected to be 3% to 14% lower than nominal, depending on the season and time of day. Using the most sensitive ZIP parameters, the active power is expected to be 9% to 20% lower than nominal, also depending on the season and time of day.","Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers","","National Renewable Energy Lab.

Building owners can obtain a wide range of energy consumption details at various levels of time granularity to augment their decisions as they manage the building operation and interact with the grid. AMI data are providing a new level of detail and visibility that may enhance building services and assets in the smart grid domain and make buildings inch closer to becoming a grid-interactive energy efficient buildings (GEB). While utility-installed AMI typically records energy consumption at a 15, 30, or 60-minute resolution, building-owner-installed metering can record energy consumption at one-minute or sub-minute time scales, providing information about how much the energy consumption varies from one sub-minute to the other (i.e. variability) at a finer time resolutions than typically available from AMI. This paper examines one-minute building load profile data sets and presents a framework to study, define, extract, quantify and analyze variability in buildings’ load profiles. The discussion of variability and its analysis is based on a case study of an actual sub-minute time-resolution data set, collected in 2019, for two buildings in a Midwest state in the USA. The result shows that for the case studies, the level of variability in an end-use category is not simply proportional to its consumption. Furthermore, distinct and predictable daily variability patterns emerge in end-use load categories. This information is useful for a host of applications including prediction, forecasting, and modeling.","Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers","","National Renewable Energy Lab.

However, due to intermittency and sharply changing rate of renewable energy, it is likely to experience insufficient or excessive power for islanded areas. Therefore, a microgrid controller featured with flexible boundaries is proposed. With proposed microgrid controller, the microgrid can not only shrink or expand its boundaries according to current renewable energy supply, but also disconnect/connect to the main grid with a designated SS. Furthermore, to ensure the microgrid controller could obtain suitable boundaries on the time scale of seconds, a real-time power management technique with alternative generating algorithm is designed to generate all possible alternative boundaries and choose the optimal one, which is scalable to any topology. In addition, in order to maintain state of charge of batteries within a desirable range, anti-overcharge/discharge strategies are designed. Four comprehensive experiments verify that the implementation of the microgrid controllers can realise flexible boundaries and deal with sharply changing rate of renewable generation or load on the time scale of seconds.","Institution of Engineering and Technology","","Oak Ridge National Lab.

"Fifth-Generation District Heating and Cooling Substations: Demand Response with Artificial Neural Network-Based Model Predictive Control","Buffa, Simone; Soppelsa, Anton; Pipiciello, Mauro; Henze, Gregor; Fedrizzi, Roberto","32 ENERGY CONSERVATION, CONSUMPTION, AND UTILIZATION; 5GDH; ambient loops; cold district heating; demand side management; heat pump systems; smart energy systems","District heating and cooling (DHC) is considered one of the most sustainable technologies to meet the heating and cooling demands of buildings in urban areas. The fifth-generation district heating and cooling (5GDHC) concept, often referred to as ambient loops, is a novel solution emerging in Europe and has become a widely discussed topic in current energy system research. 5GDHC systems operate at a temperature close to the ground and include electrically driven heat pumps and associated thermal energy storage in a building-sited energy transfer station (ETS) to satisfy user comfort. This work presents new strategies for improving the operation of these energy transfer stations by means of a model predictive control (MPC) method based on recurrent artificial neural networks. The results show that, under simple time-of-use utility rates, the advanced controller outperforms a rule-based controller for smart charging of the domestic hot water (DHW) thermal energy storage under specific boundary conditions. By exploiting the available thermal energy storage capacity, the MPC controller is capable of shifting up to 14% of the electricity consumption of the ETS from on-peak to off-peak hours. Therefore, the advanced control implemented in 5GDHC networks promotes coupling between the thermal and the electric sector, producing flexibility on the electric grid.","MDPI","","National Renewable Energy Lab.

A cellular-based communication system connecting multiple traffic lights can help realize the full potential of energy-efficient driving at intersections. Thus, we propose a hierarchical speed planner that can leverage information from multiple connected traffic lights. The proposed speed planner consists of two modules: a green window selector and a reference trajectory generator. The green window selector, based on Dijkstra’s algorithm, finds a series of ""green windows"" for connected traffic lights that builds an energy-optimal path for vehicles to follow. The reference trajectory generator finds optimal entering times, based on the selected green window at each intersection, and then computes reference trajectories. Deriving and using analytical optimal entering speeds as a function of entering times allows us to guarantee the computational simplicity suitable for real-time implementation. We also demonstrate how to balance energy and traffic flow perspectives in the reference trajectory generator. Lastly, a high-fidelity simulation framework is used to evaluate the proposed speed planner and quantify the extent to which it can save energy in various real-world urban route scenarios.","IEEE","","Argonne National Lab.

The methodology described here addresses this need by (1) demonstrating a process for creating and testing example morphologies for new neighborhoods for their impact on local and regional meteorology within a two-way-coupled four-domain nested mesoscale weather model (6 km horizontal resolution outer domain, 90 m horizontal innermost domain) and (2) allocating resulting building-level meteorological profiles to each building in a neighborhood for parallel computation of building-by-building energy use. Our Chicago Loop test case shows that the morphology of even a small new added development to a neighborhood affects not only its own microclimate, but also the microclimate of the original neighborhood to which the development was added, and that these changes in microclimate affect both neighborhoods’ building energy use. Furthermore, this method represents an important step toward quantifying and analyzing the relationships among climatic conditions, urban morphology, and energy use and using these relationships to inform energy-efficient urban development and planning.","Elsevier","","Oak Ridge National Lab.

For this purpose, a variety of daylight-redirecting window systems have been developed over the past 150 years. Fixed reflective systems (slats/light shelves) or prismatic systems that rely on total internal reflection work well under specific solar conditions, but generally sacrifice performance over a much wider range of incident solar angles and sky conditions. Dynamic systems - typically reflective slats - are more responsive to sun angles but have not been able to achieve optimal performance for glare and daylight redirection efficiency. A previous investigation into an adjustable, reflective blind concept first conceived of in the late 1970s showed promise but was not reduced to practice due to lack of adequate simulation and analysis tools. In this paper, this concept is further developed and its energy and visual comfort performance evaluated for four mid-latitude, temperate climates using ray-tracing simulation techniques. Overall, results indicate significant potential lighting energy savings when compared with conventional automated reflective blinds (2.1–4.9 kWh/(m<sup>2</sup>·a), or 14%–42%, depending on climate and orientation) or, especially, manually-operated matte white venetian blinds (1.4–7.9 kWh/(m<sup>2</sup>·a), or 9%–54%, depending on climate and orientation), while maintaining acceptable or better visual comfort conditions throughout the interior space.","Springer","","Lawrence Berkeley National Lab.

This paper reviews and summarizes the impact of lighting environment on task performance, specifically for the built environment audience. Existing studies included a variety of performance tests on cognitive performance and perception, visual acuity and reaction, memory, reasoning, and labor productivity. Illuminance, luminance ratio and correlated color temperature were found to affect performance in different ways, reflecting the impact of experimental techniques, conditions, performance evaluation methods used and data analysis methods. These were reviewed and categorized, with discussion on limitations related to sample size, modeling approach, carryover effects and other factors affecting individual differences in performance, with recommendations for future improvement. Although no universal conclusions can be made, in general, task performance seems to improve with higher illuminances, contrast ratios in the range of 7–11:1 (while always making sure that glare will not occur in the space) and higher correlated color temperature, while spectral tuning in the red or blue wavelengths has also shown positive effects. To obtain more generic evidence, future studies should be more consistent in terms of experimental procedures and overall light conditions, and also consider the effects of vertical illuminance, daylight provision/control, and outside views on task performance. Finally, studying performance with multi-factorial designs in a human-centered optimized manner (such as deploying variable lighting scenarios optimized for various tasks) can lead to deeper understanding of lighting effects on task performance, and ultimately to improved lighting design and operation in buildings overall.","Elsevier","","National Renewable Energy Lab.

Offshore renewables interconnection using submarine medium- and high-voltage direct current technologies are used to produce liquid air that can be transported to end-use locations using repurposed liquefied natural gas tankers. Two important possibilities arise from using the proposed technology. The first possibility allows the integration with conventional thermal cycles to improve efficiency. This approach can be used to leverage efficiencies of thermal systems that have already reached a plateau in the maximum achievable efficiency via design and operation optimization. The second possibility is related to the incorporation of low temperature cycles to recover waste heat from other thermal processes. This is important considering that waste heat accounts for more than 60% of the consumed energy in the United States. A detailed technical description of the complete cycle from cryogen generation to end-use of energy is provided.

Additionally, commercial refrigeration (R) systems add about 1 quad to commercial buildings energy consumption. Most HVAC systems operate with one or more faults that result in increased energy consumption. Fault detection and diagnostics (FDD) tools have been developed to address this national issue, and many tools are commercially available. FDD tools have the potential to save considerable energy for an existing commercial rooftop unit (RTU) and refrigeration systems. These devices can be used for both retro commissioning and, when faults are addressed, continuous commissioning. However, there appears to be multiple market barriers for this technology. Although there are efforts to develop FDD tool standards, currently there are no standards and methods to define functions, capabilities, accuracy, and reliability of FDD tools in the field. Moreover, most of the commercial FDD tools have not been verified in the field independently. This paper presents a comprehensive approach for bringing HVAC FDD tools into the mainstream. The approach involves demonstrating ten commercially available FDD tools installed at ten different sites, independent testing and evaluation of the FDD tools, communication with various stakeholders, identifying and assessing market barriers, creating a process evaluation methodology, and assisting utility companies in developing incentive programs. Furthermore, the preliminary baseline results from the case study demonstrate how the use of an independent monitoring system (IMS) can be used for ground-truth in evaluating FDD tools in the field.","AMSE","","Univ. of New Haven, West Haven, CT (United States)","USDOE Office of Energy Efficiency and Renewable Energy (EERE)","","United States","2020-08-19T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: Journal of Engineering for Sustainable Buildings and Cities; Journal Volume: 1; Journal Issue: 3","","Medium: ED; Size: Article No. 030902","","","EE0008189","Journal ID: ISSN 2642-6641","10.1115/1.4047958","","2022-05-17T00:00:00Z","1846415","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/1846415","https://www.osti.gov/servlets/purl/1846415","Journal of Engineering for Sustainable Buildings and Cities","3","1"
"Modulating thermal load through lightweight residential building walls using thermal energy storage and controlled precooling strategy","Kishore, Ravi; Bianchi, Marcus; Booten, Chuck; Vidal, Judith; Jackson, Roderick","32 ENERGY CONSERVATION, CONSUMPTION, AND UTILIZATION; buildings; energy use; PCM; peak load; precooling; set-point","Precooling is a recognized technique for reducing cooling energy in buildings during peak hours by shifting load to off-peak hours. This technique is particularly effective in buildings with high thermal mass, because of their large thermal energy storage capacity, and in commercial buildings due to their variable electricity pricing based on time-of-use rates. Precooling in residential buildings has been a matter of limited interest in the past because of their low thermal mass and typically uniform electricity pricing rate. While previous studies on precooling primarily focused on cost savings, an important aspect of precooling is the thermal load modulation, which could be very effective in managing peak demand in lightweight residential buildings integrated with thermal energy storage systems. In this study, we examine different precooling strategies to manage the heat gains in lightweight building walls integrated with phase-change materials. We create nine different precooling profiles by controlling the interior temperature, and then evaluate the influence of the precooling profiles on four key building energy performance parameters: total heat gain, peak heat gain, maximum heat gain during peak hours, and time at which peak occurs. To thoroughly understand the fundamental physics, we first consider hypothetical climates and obtain the optimal precooling strategy required to achieve maximum peak shedding and shifting while minimizing the total heat gains. We then extend the model to Baltimore, Maryland, and estimate the benefits of the optimized precooling strategy under real conditions. The optimal precooling strategy proposed in this study can shift the peak heat gain by up to 14 hours, thereby reducing the heat gain during peak period by up to 95%, at the expense of a 23% increase in the total heat gains.","Elsevier","","National Renewable Energy Lab.

WBES programs generally have computational constraints that affect the development and implementation of component simulation sub-models. WBES programs require models that execute quickly and efficiently due to how the programs are utilized by design engineers. WBES programs also require models to be formulated so their performance can be determined from boundary conditions set by upstream components and environmental conditions. The GHE model developed during this work utilizes an existing response factor model and extends its capabilities to accurately and robustly simulate at timesteps that are shorter than the GHE transit time. This was accomplished by developing a simplified dynamic borehole model and then exercising that model to generate exiting fluid temperature response factors. This approach blends numerical and analytical modeling methods. The existing response factor models are then extended to incorporate the exiting fluid temperature response factor to provide a better estimate of the GHE exiting fluid temperature at short simulation timesteps.","MDPI","","National Renewable Energy Lab.

To advance knowledge of indoor environmental quality in Chinese nonresidential buildings, this study conducted post-occupancy evaluation (POE) in varied use areas within schools, hospitals, offices, hotels and shopping malls through environmental measurements and occupant surveys in 10 buildings over four seasons in Chongqing, China. Measured thermal conditions were more frequently within comfort standards in winter than in summer according to the predicted mean vote – predicted percentage dissatisfied model; but the model did not reliably predict thermal satisfaction. There was insufficient illuminance in 28% of studied areas and high illuminance in shopping malls led to complaints about glare. Sound pressure exceeded the Chinese guideline in all buildings with shopping malls having significantly higher levels than other buildings. CO<sub>2</sub> was generally below the Chinese national guideline of 1000 ppm; the two percent of measurements that exceeded the guideline occurred in classrooms, hospital wards and underground supermarkets. Formaldehyde did not exceed the limit level of 0.1 mg/m3 in any space. Most of the buildings did not provide effective protection from outdoor fine particulate matter (PM2.5), and infiltration from outdoors was the main factor for exceeding health-based guidelines indoors. Shopping malls had lower IEQ satisfaction than offices, schools and hospitals. Sound was the factor with the lowest satisfaction level among the four principal environmental factors.

Working with the U.S. Air Force, the U.S. Department of Energy's National Renewable Energy Laboratory (NREL) developed a replicable energy resilience assessment methodology and investment decision tool to: (1) identify and score hazards and vulnerabilities at the site level; (2) analyze risks to energy infrastructure; and (3) identify and prioritize energy resilience investments. This work improves on existing resilience assessment methodologies and tools by combining a bottom-up, all-hazards assessment methodology with top-down geographic information system mapping capabilities to provide an innovative, dynamic tool for identifying and prioritizing actionable solutions. This process combines probabilistic forecasting with an iterative approach for continuously updating and reassessing risks to address temporal dynamism. Relationships among systems are modeled and visualized to estimate the effectiveness of resilience actions across multiple interdependent systems and inform financial priorities through cost-difficulty-impact trade-offs. The approach is validated in a case study at Tyndall Air Force Base (AFB) in Florida, which experienced a Category 5 hurricane in 2018. The risks and mitigation strategies identified pre-hurricane are compared with post-hurricane, realized impacts. The assessment effectively identifies risks and actions to increase site energy resilience, but the methodology can be enhanced though greater consideration of the interdependencies between the energy system and related systems like transportation, communication, and food/water systems, which impact the recovery of the energy system and the base.","Elsevier","","National Renewable Energy Lab.

The energy used for space conditioning can be reduced by utilizing thermal energy storage, such as phase change materials (PCMs), into building envelopes; however, the energy savings of PCM-integrated building envelopes reported in the literature vary widely. In the absence of established guidelines, thermophysical requirements of an optimal PCM, its method of application into the building envelope, and the corresponding energy savings under various climates remain unknown. Here, we perform an extensive numerical investigation on the integration of PCM into building walls to establish the key conditions required for effective utilization of PCM in reducing heat gains in the cooling season and heat losses in the heating season. We also determine the optimal transition temperature, optimal PCM location in the wall, and the energy-saving potential of the PCM-integrated building walls in five U.S. cities located in different International Energy Conservation Code climate zones. Results show that employing PCMs in building walls does not always lead to an improvement; in fact, incorrect applications of PCMs can substantially increase energy use in the buildings. In the climates we studied, PCMs were found effective in reducing heat gains during the cooling season while mostly ineffective in managing heat losses during heating season. Depending on the climate, optimized PCMs in U.S. building walls can provide reduction in the annual heat gain in the range of 3.5% to 47.2% and the annual heat loss in the range of -2.8% to 8.3%.

"Optimization Framework to Assess the Demand Response Capacity of a Water Distribution System","Liu, Yang; Barrows, Clayton; Macknick, Jordan; Mauter, Meagan","32 ENERGY CONSERVATION, CONSUMPTION, AND UTILIZATION; demand response capacity; modeling; optimization framework; water distribution","As large electricity consumers, water distribution system (WDS) pumping stations have the potential to become meaningful participants in demand response (DR) programs. The authors propose an optimization framework for assessing the DR capacity of a WDS and identifying the optimal bidding strategy for maximizing WDS revenue in the DR spot market. The proposed mixed integer linear programming (MILP) model overcomes computational constraints of previous DR optimization models by adopting a preprocessing procedure to minimize the number of binary variables and implementing a convex relaxation technique to linearize the hydraulic equations. The proposed MILP model also explicitly accounts for varying levels of risk tolerance of WDS operators by varying the recovery period over which pumping returns to business-as-usual operation. The optimization framework is implemented on a skeletonized 48-node WDS model that includes 7 pumps, 6 tanks, and 39 pipes. Using a simulated DR event and water consumption profile, the authors derive the optimal DR supply curves (i.e., compensation price versus load curtailment quantity) and revenue potential of the WDS under six scenarios for DR participation.","American Society of Civil Engineers (ASCE)","","National Renewable Energy Lab.

"Evaluation of low-exergy heating and cooling systems and topology optimization for deep energy savings at the urban district level","Allen, Amy; Henze, Gregor; Baker, Kyri; Pavlak, Gregory","32 ENERGY CONSERVATION, CONSUMPTION, AND UTILIZATION; topology analysis; hydraulic network modeling; buildings; fifth-generation district heating and cooling systems","District energy systems have the potential to achieve deep energy savings by leveraging the density and diversity of loads in urban districts. However, planning and adoption of district thermal energy systems is hindered by the analytical burden and high infrastructure costs. It is hypothesized that network topology optimization would enable wider adoption of advanced (ambient temperature) district thermal energy systems, resulting in energy savings. In this study, energy modeling is used to compare the energy performance of “conventional” and “advanced” district thermal energy systems at the urban district level, and a partial exhaustive search is used to evaluate a heuristic for the topology optimization problem. For the prototypical district considered, advanced district thermal energy systems mated with low-exergy building heating and cooling systems achieved a source energy use intensity that was 49% lower than that of conventional systems. The minimal spanning tree heuristic was demonstrated to be effective for the network topology optimization problem in the context of a prototypical district, and contributes to mitigating the problem’s computational complexity. The work presented in this paper demonstrates the potential of advanced district thermal energy systems to achieve deep energy savings, and advances to addressing barriers to their adoption through topology optimization.","Elsevier","","National Renewable Energy Lab.

"How does urbanization affect CO<sub>2</sub> emissions of central heating systems in China?

However, how urbanization affects the CO<sub>2</sub> emissions of central heating systems at high spatial resolution in China has not been fully studied before. Based on satellite-observed NPP-VIIRS nighttime light (NTL) data, we develop a 5 km x 5 km annual CO<sub>2</sub> emission inventory for coal boilers, thermal power plants (TPPs), and natural gas boilers in China's central heating systems for the period 2012-2017 by using the geographical and temporally weighted regression (GTWR) model. It is observed that nonurban areas generated 2-4 times the CO<sub>2</sub> emissions of coal boilers in urban areas. The largest increments of CO<sub>2</sub> emissions of gas boilers are observed in urban areas of the eastern (6.80 times) and central regions (2.86 times) in 2013-2014, due to the clean heating policy in the ""2 + 26"" cities in China. The effects of urbanization on CO<sub>2</sub> emissions from natural gas boilers are approximately 2-3 times those of coal boilers, and the differences are largest in western cities with only minor differences in northeastern cities. Overall, our results will aid in designing low-carbon development goals and provide micro-level information on central heating facilities in urbanized and less developed regions.","Elsevier","","Argonne National Lab.

"Modeling and analysis of heat emissions from buildings to ambient air","Hong, Tianzhen; Ferrando, Martina; Luo, Xuan; Causone, Francesco","32 ENERGY CONSERVATION, CONSUMPTION, AND UTILIZATION; Buildings heat emission; Building performance simulation; Urban heat island effect; Urban environment; Microclimate; Anthropogenic heat","Heat emissions from buildings is a significant source of anthropogenic heat influencing the urban microclimate; however, they are usually oversimplified in urban climate and microclimate modeling. This study developed a bottom-up physics-based approach to calculate heat emissions from buildings to the ambient air and implemented the approach in EnergyPlus. In this work, a simple result verification was conducted by comparing the EnergyPlus simulated results against the spreadsheet calculations. Simulations covering 16 commercial building types, four climates, and two energy efficiency levels were conducted to understand and evaluate the building heat emissions and their temporal patterns as well as three major components: (1) building envelope (convective heat transfer to ambient air), (2) zones (air exfiltration and exhaust air), and (3) HVAC systems (relief air and heat rejection from condensers or cooling towers). The main findings are: (1) heat emissions are usually higher than the site energy use (about 2.5 times), and their dynamics should be considered; (2) building characteristics and their energy systems lead to differences in heat emission contributions from the three components, and their dynamics, for example, in the warehouse models, the envelope component accounts for 90.4%, while it is 12.7% for the large office models; (3) for most building typologies, the climate has a strong impact on heat emissions, for example, buildings with dominant heat emissions from the zone exhaust air and/or the HVAC reject heat, a general decrease in heat emissions in hotter climates is observed, while envelope-dominated buildings show the opposite; and (4) building technologies that reduce energy use in buildings may perform differently in reducing heat emissions. The developed heat emissions calculation method can be adopted in EnergyPlus and most other building energy modeling programs. It can provide dynamic building heat emissions as an input to urban climate computational fluid dynamics (CFD) models at a higher spatial and temporal resolution than is currently available, to improve the simulation accuracy of the urban microclimate and capture the urban heat island effect and urban overheating.","Elsevier","","Lawrence Berkeley National Lab.

"Improving air leakage prediction of buildings using the fan pressurization method with the Weighted Line of Organic Correlation","Kölsch, Benedikt; Walker, Iain S.","32 ENERGY CONSERVATION, CONSUMPTION, AND UTILIZATION; Fan pressurization; Weighted line of organic correlation; Ordinary least square fitting; Power law; Building envelope; Airtightness","In many countries, the fan pressurization method is the most frequently chosen approach for measuring the air leakage of houses. The measurements are usually performed at pressures that far exceed pressures to which buildings are exposed to under normal conditions. A fit of these tests to the power-law formulation allows an extrapolation to data points outside the measured pressure range. With the Ordinary Least Square (OLS) fitting method, the pressure exponent and flow coefficient can be determined. However, the measurement results are highly sensitive to uncertainties induced by external factors like changing wind conditions during the tests, which is neglected by OLS. This may lead to errors in the prediction of flows at lower pressures. The Weighted Line of Organic Correlation (WLOC) is an alternative approach and takes measurement uncertainty into account. In this paper, a statistical analysis of an extensive data set of pressurization measurements has been performed. Both regression techniques have been compared for almost 7500 fan pressurization measurements of six houses in 109 different house leak configurations. The variability in predicting pressure exponent and flow coefficient for both WLOC and OLS regression was analyzed using probability density functions. It was found that the Weighted Line of Organic Correlation significantly decreases the uncertainty in predicting pressure exponent, flow coefficient, and other low-pressure air leakage metrics compared to the Ordinary Least Square fitting. Here, the authors highly recommend the implementation of WLOC in current measurement standards and test equipment.","Elsevier","","Lawrence Berkeley National Lab.

"Automated Control of Transactive HVACs in Energy Distribution Systems","Liu, Boming; Akcakaya, Murat; McDermott, Thomas E.","32 ENERGY CONSERVATION, CONSUMPTION, AND UTILIZATION; transactive energy; reinforcement learning; HVAC","Heating, Ventilation, and Air Conditioning (HVAC) systems contribute significantly to a building’s energy consumption. In the recent years, there is an increased interest in developing transactive approaches which could enable automated and flexible scheduling of HVAC systems based on the customer demand and the electricity prices decided by the suppliers. Flexible and automated scheduling of the HVAC systems make it a prime source for participation in residential demand response or transactive energy systems. Therefore, it is of significant interest to identify an optimal strategy to control the HVAC systems. Here, reducing the energy cost while keeping the comfort level acceptable to the users, we argue that such a control strategy should consider both the energy cost and user comfort simultaneously. Accordingly, we develop the control strategy through the solution of an optimization problem that balances between the energy cost and consumer’s dissatisfaction. This optimization enables us to solve a decision-making problem through first price prediction and then choosing HVAC temperature settings throughout the day based on the predicted price, history of the price and HVAC settings, and outside temperature. More specifically, we formulate the control design as a Markov decision process (MDP) using deep neural networks and use Deep Deterministic Policy Gradients (DDPG)-based deep reinforcement learning algorithm to find the optimal control strategy for HVAC systems that balances between electricity cost and user comfort.","IEEE","","Pacific Northwest National Lab.

Choosing an appropriate UBEM tool, balancing the level of complexity, accuracy, usability, and computing needs, remains a challenge for users. The review focuses on the main bottom-up physics-based UBEM tools, comparing them from a user-oriented perspective. Five categories are used: (i) the required inputs, (ii) the reported outputs, (iii) the exploited workflow, (iv) the applicability of each tool, and (v) the potential users. Moreover, a critical discussion is proposed, focusing on interests and trends in research and development. The results highlighted major differences between UBEM tools that must be considered to choose the proper one for an application. Finally, barriers of adoption of UBEM tools include the needs of a standardized ontology, a common three-dimensional city model, a standard procedure to collect data, and a standard set of test cases.

The minimum airflow rate setting of VAV terminal boxes has a significant impact on both energy consumption and indoor air quality. Conventional controls usually have the terminal’s minimum airflow rate at a constant (e.g., 30% or more of the terminal design airflow rate), irrespective of the occupancy status, which may cause problems, such as excessive simultaneous heating and cooling, under ventilation, and thermal comfort issues. This paper examines the potential of energy savings from occupancy-based controls (OBCs). The sensed occupancy information, either occupant presence or people count, is used to determine the airflow rate of terminal boxes, the thermostat setpoints, and the lighting control. Using EnergyPlus, a whole-building energy modeling software, the energy savings of OBC strategies are evaluated for representative existing medium office buildings in the U.S. The simulation results show that the conventional OBC, based on occupant presence sensing, can save 8% of whole-building energy use in Miami (hot climate) for systems without air-side economizer and about 13% in both Baltimore (mixed climate) and Chicago (cold climate). Comparatively, the advanced OBC, based on people counting, can save 8% in Miami to 23% in Baltimore for systems with economizers. The outdoor-air fraction of the supply air from air-handling units significantly affects the potential energy savings from the advanced OBC strategy. In addition to energy savings, the advanced OBC satisfies the zone ventilation during all occupied hours over the whole year.","MDPI AG","","Pacific Northwest National Lab.

Two major difficulties in reducing uncertainties arise from the variety of geographically overlapping CH<sub>4</sub> sources and from the destruction of CH<sub>4</sub> by short-lived hydroxyl radicals (OH). To address these difficulties, we have established a consortium of multi-disciplinary scientists under the umbrella of the Global Carbon Project to synthesize and stimulate new research aimed at improving and regularly updating the global methane budget. Following Saunois et al. (2016), we present here the second version of the living review paper dedicated to the decadal methane budget, integrating results of top-down studies (atmospheric observations within an atmospheric inverse-modelling framework) and bottom-up estimates (including process-based models for estimating land surface emissions and atmospheric chemistry, inventories of anthropogenic emissions, and data-driven extrapolations).","Copernicus","","Pacific Northwest National Lab.

"Quantifying Airport Employee Commuting and Related Energy Use: A Comparison of Six US Airports","Zimny-Schmitt, Daniel; Sperling, Joshua","32 ENERGY CONSERVATION, CONSUMPTION, AND UTILIZATION; transportation demand management; commuting; airports; energy use; airport access","There has been growing research interest in understanding the energy signatures of airport access and egress as air travel continues to grow. However, these findings generally focus on airport access from the perspective of air travelers rather than ground access modes by airport employees. Using a data set of employment records, this paper uses residential location data of airport employees to estimate the energy implications of employee commuting at six major US airports based on commuting mode choice information from the US Census. This analysis reveals a high degree of variance in commuting energy usage by employees between different airports.","Findings Press","","National Renewable Energy Lab.

With recent advances in computer modeling, simulation tools, and analysis techniques, topics such as human-building interactions and occupant behavior have gained significant interest in the literature given their premise of improving building design processes and operating strategies. In practice, the focus of occupant-centric literature has been mostly geared towards the latter (i.e., operation), leaving the implications on building design practices underexplored. This paper fills the gap by providing a critical review of existing studies applying computer-based modeling and simulation to guide occupant-centric building design. The reviewed papers are organized along four main themes, namely occupant-centric: (i) metrics of building performance, (ii) modeling and simulation approaches, (iii) design methods and applications, and (iv) supporting practices and mechanisms. Important barriers are identified for a more effective application of occupant-centric building design practices, including the limited consideration of metrics beyond energy efficiency (e.g., occupant well-being and space planning), the limited implementation and validation of the proposed methods, and the lack of integration of occupant behavior modeling in existing building performance simulation tools. Finally, future research directions are discussed, covering large-scale international data collection efforts to move from generic assumptions about occupant behavior to specific/localized knowledge, improved metrics of measuring building performance, and improved industry practices, such as building codes, to promote an occupant-in-the-loop approach to the building design process.","Elsevier","","Lawrence Berkeley National Lab.

In this study, we evaluate how projected changes in water availability affect electricity generation at hydroelectric and thermal power plants and how the coincident impacts propagate locally and throughout the interconnected power grid of western United States. We also evaluate whether the prospect of climate-driven change could affect regional power dependencies. Hydrologic simulations derived from three Global Circulation Models (CCSM4, INMCM4, and GFDL-CM3), two radiative scenarios (RCP4.5 and RCP8.5) and the VIC hydrology model are used to force a large-scale, distributed water management model (MOSART-WM), which translates water availability into power generation constraints at hydropower plants and water-dependent thermoelectric plants. Power system dynamics are evaluated using the production cost model PLEXOS. We find that the interregional connections across the contemporary Western U.S. electricity infrastructure play an essential role in managing variations in regional generation due to hydrological variability. Projected WECC-scale changes in mean annual precipitation ranging from -3.8% to +17% are moderated to -6% to +4% in mean annual production cost changes. Climate change impacts on water availability in the Northwest drive future changes in other regions’ generation and in regional power flows. Northwest total generation influences interannual variability in other regions’ net generation, explaining about 40%, 50%, and 35% of the variability in Southwest, Rockies, and Southern California regions respectively. The propagation of Northwest climate change impact throughout the grid is exacerbated by the occurrence of dry years in Northern California. Generation from the Desert Southwest emerges as a critical resource to compensate for variations in water availability, and generation, in these regions. Though the regional power flow directions seem insensitive to long-term variations in water availability, our analysis highlights the need to consider other compounding regional factors, such as changes in Southern California’s net load and changes in regional fuel prices.","Elsevier","","Pacific Northwest National Lab.

"Modeling occupancy-driven building loads for large and diversified building stocks through the use of parametric schedules","Bianchi, Carlo; Zhang, Liang; Goldwasser, David; Parker, Andrew; Horsey, Henry","32 ENERGY CONSERVATION, CONSUMPTION, AND UTILIZATION; commercial buildings; building energy modeling; buildings; schedules; building stock","Building energy modeling provides a fundamental tool to assess the potential for energy efficiency to contribute to reducing world energy consumption and global emissions. Occupancy-related operations are a key source of uncertainty for building energy analysis, particularly for aggregated building stocks. At a district or city level, it is critical to estimate aggregated power load profiles for sizing power grid infrastructure, power plant capacity allocation, and energy efficiency measures. The stochastic nature of behavior-related operations complicates the creation of models that accurately capture building load profiles for entire building stocks. This research introduces a new methodology called parametric schedules to model occupancy-driven schedules for large and diverse building stocks. In contrast to computationally expensive methodologies proposed in the literature, our work does not use a recursive time-consuming step. Occupancy is estimated by the extrapolation of operation times directly from metered electric consumption data; occupancy-related schedules are stochastically assigned to each building model, guaranteeing diversity of operation times in the stock. Our procedure has been tested on a large, diversified data-set of 25,000 commercial buildings in Los Angeles, California. It proved to be able to adequately represent the stochastic schedules diversity of the stock and to refine the stock calibration process by 1%. This innovative approach represents a useful asset for utility companies, grid operators, urban planners, and balancing authorities, seeking to improve building stock modeling and better estimate the impact of energy conservation measures. – This work is part of a larger stock modeling tool called ComStock, which is under development by NREL.","Elsevier","","National Renewable Energy Lab.

To achieve that, we present a methodology for the environmental and economic evaluation of grid-connected SHSs: user-scale electric systems involving a photovoltaic (PV) power system and a battery energy storage system. The proposed methodology is based on a mixed integer linear programming (MILP) optimization, life cycle assessment and life cycle costing. This methodological framework is applied to a case study involving a typical SHS installation in Italy. The results of the environmental optimal design brought to the evaluation of a 3.25 kW PV assisted by 8.66 kWh of nickel cobalt manganese batteries, whereas the costs of the SHS are minimized by a small PV system (less than 1 kW). Results underline that the environmental optimal configurations rely on battery technologies, which entails a significant cost compared to the grid connection. In contrast, the economic optimal design solutions is less impactful than the grid mix both from an environmental and economic points of view. Thanks to a reduction of batteries and PV costs, the environmental impact of the economic optimal design is expected to decrease in the future.","Elsevier","","Lawrence Berkeley National Lab.

Current approaches to generating load profiles are time-consuming and not capable of reflecting the dynamic and stochastic behaviors of real buildings; some approaches also trigger data privacy concerns. In this study, we proposed a novel approach for generating realistic electrical load profiles of buildings through the Generative Adversarial Network (GAN), a machine learning technique that is capable of revealing an unknown probability distribution purely from data. The proposed approach has three main steps: (1) normalizing the daily 24-hour load profiles, (2) clustering the daily load profiles with the k-means algorithm, and (3) using GAN to generate daily load profiles for each cluster. The approach was tested with an open-source database – the Building Data Genome Project. We validated the proposed method by comparing the mean, standard deviation, and distribution of key parameters of the generated load profiles with those of the real ones. The KL divergence of the generated and real load profiles are within 0.3 for majority of parameters and clusters. Additionally, results showed the load profiles generated by GAN can capture not only the general trend but also the random variations of the actual electrical loads in buildings. We report the proposed GAN approach can be used to generate building electrical load profiles, verify other load profile generation models, detect changes to load profiles, and more importantly, anonymize smart meter data for sharing, to support research and applications of grid-interactive efficient buildings.","Elsevier","","Lawrence Berkeley National Lab.

Partial heating consists of a constant heat flux function imposed over a small section of the exterior of a pipe and for a limited time duration. The solution comprises steady-state and transient parts, and an algebraic identity is used to decrease the number of summation terms in the slowly-converging steady- state part. Intrinsic verification principles are used to verify the solution. As an example application, this transient solution is applied toward the development of a simple, noninvasive method for in-field measurement of the flow rate in pipes. Furthermore, to simulate this application, a pulse of energy is imposed to the wall of the pipe, and the developed mathematical solution is used to find the flow rate of the fluid inside the pipe.

In the control loop, the technical feature of the human demand-oriented supply can help operate HVAC effectively. Among many technical options, real time monitoring based on feedback signals from end users has been frequently reported as a critical technology to confirm optimizing building performance. Recent studies have incorporated human thermal physiology signals and thermal comfort/discomfort status as real-time feedback signals. A series of human subject experiments used to be conducted by primarily adopting subjective questionnaire surveys in a lab-setting study, which is limited in the application for reality. With the help of advanced technologies, physiological signals have been detected, measured and processed by using multiple technical formats, such as wearable sensors. Nevertheless, they mostly require physical contacts with the skin surface in spite of the small physical dimension and compatibility with other wearable accessories, such as goggles, and intelligent bracelets. Most recently, a low cost small infrared camera has been adopted for monitoring human facial images, which could detect the facial skin temperature and blood perfusion in a contactless way. Also, according to latest pilot studies, a conventional digital camera can generate infrared images with the help of new methods, such as the Euler video magnification technology. Human thermal comfort/discomfort poses can also be detected by video methods without contacting human bodies and be analyzed by the skeleton keypoints model.

The six cycles were compared to U.S. legislative cycles, revealing some key differences. Finally, a set of cycle weighting factors for 533 separate U.S. regions was derived from annual traffic statistics. Applying this method, it was found that regional fuel economy varies due to differences in driving patterns alone and that rural driving patterns lead to improved fuel economy (for conventional vehicles). The driving cycles and regional weighting factors described here are useful for testing and simulation studies, specifically those sensitive to regional variations in driving patterns.","Elsevier","","National Renewable Energy Lab.

"Robustness of energy performance of Zero-Net-Energy (ZNE) homes","Picard, Theo; Hong, Tianzhen; Luo, Na; Lee, Sang Hoon; Sun, Kaiyu","32 ENERGY CONSERVATION, CONSUMPTION, AND UTILIZATION; zero-net-energy home; energy use; weather variability; occupant behavior; building performance simulation; climate change","Zero-net-energy (ZNE) homes produce an adequate amount of energy on-site to meet their energy demand based on source energy for an entire year. California building energy efficiency standards require new residential buildings started in 2020 to be ZNE. For various reasons, a home designed as ZNE may not achieve ZNE performance in real operation. Here we aimed to quantify the robustness of the energy performance of ZNE homes due to weather variability, climate change, and the uncertainty of occupant behavior. A single-family ZNE house, based on the optimal cost-effective design in three California climate zones, was used to develop the EnergyPlus simulation models. Weather variations were considered from a combination of the historical 30 years’ actual meteorological year (AMY) weather data, typical year weather data in TMY3, and future weather data based on Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change scenarios. Three scenarios of occupant behavior from the energy perspective were defined to represent the uncertainty about occupants’ activities, comfort requirements, and their adaptive interactions with buildings and systems. In terms of annual source energy, the simulation results of the ZNE homes showed: (1) a decrease of 23–38 percent for occupants with energy austerity behavior and an increase of 120–130 percent for occupants with energy wasteful behavior, compared with the baseline assumption of normal occupants; (2) a variation range of –15 percent to +14 percent for the results using 30-year AMY weather data compared with the baseline results using TMY3 weather data; (3) an increase of 10–13 percent with future weather in Fresno and Riverside and a decrease of 15 percent with San Francisco; and (4) climate change can reduce the gap between the austerity and wasteful consumption. These findings provide insights into how ZNE homes may perform in reality and inform architects, engineers, occupants, and policymakers to pay more attention to occupant behavior on design, operation, and regulations of ZNE homes to ensure energy performance robustness.","Elsevier","","Lawrence Berkeley National Lab.

Among various definitions and usages for natural ventilation potential (NVP) in early design evaluation, this paper reviews and identifies the key performance indicators, and proposes two new dynamic metrics—natural ventilation cooling effectiveness (NVCE) and climate potential utilization ratio (CPUR). The metrics are dynamically responsive to various design options, in both steady and transient states, allowing consideration of thermal mass. Assisting in design development processes, the metrics quantify how well indoor spaces make use of natural ventilation’s cooling capacity. Case studies are presented to demonstrate how NVCE and CPUR enable designers to evaluate the predicted performance and how to apply the information to improve building design. Finally, the results of the design iterations showed that the relationship among various design parameters should be dynamically understood in order to evaluate the performance of natural ventilation, confirming that “the more the airflow, the greater the potential,” and “the heavier the thermal mass, the greater the energy saving” were not always true.","Elsevier","","Lawrence Berkeley National Lab.

"Association of residential energy efficiency retrofits with indoor environmental quality, comfort, and health: A review of empirical data","Fisk, William J.; Singer, Brett C.; Chan, Wanyu R.","32 ENERGY CONSERVATION, CONSUMPTION, AND UTILIZATION; energy efficiency; indoor environmental quality; residential; retrofit; thermal comfort; health","This paper reviews empirical data from evaluations of the influence of residential energy efficiency retrofits on indoor environmental quality conditions and self-reported thermal comfort and health. The data were extracted from 36 studies described in 44 papers plus two reports. Nearly all reviewed studies were performed in Europe or United States. Most studies evaluated retrofits of homes with low-income occupants. Indoor radon and formaldehyde concentrations tended to increase after retrofits that did not add whole-house mechanical ventilation. Study-average indoor concentrations of nitrogen dioxide and volatile organic compounds other than formaldehyde increased and decreased with approximately equal frequency. Average indoor temperatures during winter typically increased after retrofits, usually by less than 1.5 °C. Dampness and mold, usually based on occupant's reports, almost always decreased after retrofits. Subjectively reported thermal comfort, thermal discomfort, non-asthma respiratory symptoms, general health, and mental health nearly always improved after retrofits. For asthma symptoms, the evidence of improvement slightly outweighed the evidence of worsening. There was insufficient evidence to determine whether changes in thermal comfort and health outcomes varied depending on the type of energy efficiency retrofit.

"Laboratory Validation of Integrated Lighting Systems Retrofit Performance and Energy Savings","Shackelford, Jordan; Mathew, Paul; Regnier, Cynthia; Walter, Travis","32 ENERGY CONSERVATION, CONSUMPTION, AND UTILIZATION; integrated lighting retrofits; advanced lighting controls; daylighting; LEDs; commercial buildings; energy savings; automated shading systems","Light-emitting diodes (LED) fixtures and lamps have emerged as leading technologies for general illumination and are a well-established energy efficiency retrofit measure in commercial buildings (from around 2% of installed fixtures and lamps in 2013 to 28% by 2020). Retrofit approaches that integrate elements, such as networked controls, daylight dimming, and advanced shade technologies lag in comparison. Integrated retrofits have been shown to increase savings over single end-use retrofits, but are perceived as higher complexity and risk. More validation of integrated lighting system performance is needed. This study presents results from laboratory testing of three packages combining fixtures, networked controls, task tuning, and daylight dimming, advanced shades, and lighting layout changes. We characterize performance in perimeter open-office zones, finding energy savings from 20% for daylight dimming and automated shades (no LED retrofit) to over 70% for LED retrofits with advanced controls and shades or lighting layout changes. We present some implementation details, including lessons learned from installation and commissioning in the laboratory setting. We also discuss cost-benefit analysis approaches for the types of packages presented, including the need to quantify and incorporate energy and non-energy benefits for advanced shades packages, which enhance occupant comfort but add significant cost.","MDPI AG","","Lawrence Berkeley National Lab.

"Sustainable framework for buildings in cold regions of China considering life cycle cost and environmental impact as well as thermal comfort","Wang, Ran; Lu, Shilei; Feng, Wei; Zhai, Xue; Li, Xinhua","32 ENERGY CONSERVATION, CONSUMPTION, AND UTILIZATION; life cycle assessment; life cycle cost; greenhouse gas emissions; thermal comfort; sustainable building","In recent decades, environmental problems have enforced designers to estimate the level of environmental emission of building design and reduce their environmental impact. On the premise of ensuring indoor comfort, the cost-effectiveness of solutions for reducing the building’s greenhouse gas has become a critical issue. Based on the Life Cycle Assessment (LCA), this paper establishes a building performance trade-off framework for indoor thermal comfort, economics, and environmental implication. This framework consists of four parts: the establishment of the optimization model; sensitivity analysis; obtain of Pareto frontier solutions, and decision-making analysis. Optimization variables involve envelope type and some envelope physical parameters. The “design variables-building performances” database is obtained by using building simulation software combined with the Latin hypercube sampling algorithm. Sensitivity analysis is used to extract the key factors affecting building performance. The designer can prioritize these key factors and it can reduce the uncertainty of building performance. A multi-objective optimization method coupling Gradient Boosted Decision Tree (GBDT) and non-dominated sorting genetic (NSGA-II) algorithm is proposed to seek the trade-off between three performances (obtain Pareto frontier solutions). The Pareto solution provides a more comprehensive reference for the preferences of different stakeholders, and the set of alternative solutions is further shrunk. Finally, take a specific residential building in China’s cold climate zone as a showcase of the trade-off framework. According to the obtained Pareto frontier solution, the solution set is shrunk to a certain range, and the distribution ranges of Life Cycle Costs, the greenhouse gas emissions, and the annual thermal discomfort hour ratio are 122.3–137.1 USD/m<sup>2</sup>, 15.6–44.8 kg CO<sub>2</sub>/m<sup>2</sup>, and 19.1–25.2%, respectively. The trade-off framework adopts the order of objective Pareto optimal and then subjective preference selection, narrowing the scope of alternatives for designers and saving time-cost of decision-making.","Elsevier","","Lawrence Berkeley National Lab.

"Impact of Intersection Control on Battery Electric Vehicle Energy Consumption","Ahn, Kyoungho; Park, Sangjun; Rakha, Hesham A.","32 ENERGY CONSERVATION, CONSUMPTION, AND UTILIZATION; 42 ENGINEERING; 54 ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCES; 97 MATHEMATICS AND COMPUTING; battery electric vehicles; signalized intersections; traffic signal control","<p>Battery electric vehicle (BEV) sales have significantly increased in recent years. They have different energy consumption patterns compared to the fuel consumption patterns of internal combustion engine vehicles (ICEVs). This study quantified the impact of intersection control approaches—roundabout, traffic signal, and two-way stop controls—on BEVs’ energy consumption. The paper systematically investigates BEVs’ energy consumption patterns compared to the fuel consumption of ICEVs. The results indicate that BEVs’ energy consumption patterns are significantly different than ICEVs’ patterns. For example, for BEVs approaching a high-speed intersection, the roundabout was found to be the most energy-efficient intersection control, while the two-way stop sign was the least efficient. In contrast, for ICEVs, the two-way stop sign was the most fuel-efficient control, while the roundabout was the least efficient. Findings also indicate that the energy saving of traffic signal coordination was less significant for BEVs compared to the fuel consumption of ICEVs since more regenerative energy is produced when partial or poorly coordinated signal plans are implemented. The study confirms that BEV regenerative energy is a major factor in energy efficiency, and that BEVs recover different amounts of energy in different urban driving environments. The study suggests that new transportation facilities and control strategies should be designed to enhance BEVs’ energy efficiency, particularly in zero emission zones.</p>","MDPI AG","","Virginia Polytechnic Inst. and State Univ.

"Using Residential and Office Building Archetypes for Energy Efficiency Building Solutions in an Urban Scale: A China Case Study","Ding, Chao; Zhou, Nan","32 ENERGY CONSERVATION, CONSUMPTION, AND UTILIZATION; urban scale; building energy simulation; EnergyPlus; regression; building archetypes","Building energy consumption accounts for 36% of the overall energy end use worldwide and is growing rapidly as developing countries continue to urbanize. Understanding the energy use at urban scale will lay the foundation for identification of energy efficiency opportunities to be deployed at speed. China has almost half of global new constructions and plays an important role in building suitability. However, an open source national building energy consumption database is not available in China. To provide data support for building energy consumptions, this paper used a simulation method to develop an urban building energy consumption database for a pilot city in Wuhan, China. First, residential, small, and large office building archetype energy models were created in EnergyPlus to represent typical building energy consumption in Wuhan. The baseline reference model simulation results were further validated using survey data from the literature. Second, stochastic simulations were conducted to consider different design parameters and occupants’ energy usage intensity scenarios, such as thermal properties of the building envelope, lighting power density, equipment power density, HVAC (heating, ventilation and air conditioning) schedule, etc. A building energy consumption database was generated for typical building archetypes. Third, data-driven regression analysis was conducted to support quick building energy consumption prediction using key high- level building information inputs. Finally, a web-based urban energy platform and an interface were developed to support further third-party application development. The research is expected to provide fast energy efficiency building design solutions for urban planning, new constructions as well as building retrofits.","MDPI AG","","Lawrence Berkeley National Lab.

"Performance of Closed Loop Venturi Aspirated Aeration System: Experimental Study and Numerical Analysis with Discrete Bubble Model","Mahmud, Roohany; Erguvan, Mustafa; MacPhee, David W.","32 ENERGY CONSERVATION, CONSUMPTION, AND UTILIZATION; venturi aerator; dissolved oxygen; standard aeration efficiency","In wastewater treatment plants, aeration plays a significant role as it encourages aerobic respiration of microbes, which are necessary to break down carbonaceous matter in the waste stream. This process can account for the majority of energy use in wastewater treatment plants. The aeration process is also necessary in odor control in lagoons and in the aquaculture industry. Generally, the aeration process is accomplished with compressors or blowers which can be of low efficiency due to ideal gas laws. This study introduces the idea of increasing aeration efficiency by looping water from a reservoir through a piping network which includes a venturi aspirator at its inlet. For this purpose, an experimental study has been conducted in a laboratory setup with a pump which pulls water from a tank, passes it through a Venturi aspirator and a helical piping network intended to increase bubble residence time, before depositing it back into the bulk fluid tank. This same process is modeled computationally, using a discrete bubble method (DBM), with good agreement with experiments. The overall purpose here is to determine the optimal configurations for standard aeration efficiency (SAE) and the standard oxygen transfer rate (SOTR). A parametric study has been implemented using the DBM based on different hydraulic and flow parameters. The model is also used to predict the SAE of a hypothetical aeration system. Results indicate that it is possible to achieve SAE values in the range of surface aerators or submersed jet aerators using the proposed aeration system with less complex components, thereby decreasing overall costs.","MDPI","","Univ. of Alabama, Tuscaloosa, AL (United States)","USDOE Office of Energy Efficiency and Renewable Energy (EERE), Energy Efficiency Office.

Yet, the requirement of 16 ATP molecules by the Fe protein for the 8 electron transfer is an energy-intense caveat to the enzymatic synthesis of NH<sub>3</sub> and is challenging from an electrochemical perspective. Thus, we report the redox polymer-based ATP-free mediated electron-transfer system of MoFe nitrogenase using cobaltocene-functionalized poly(allylamine) (Cc-PAA), which is able to reduce the MoFe nitrogenase directly with a low redox potential of -0.58 V vs SHE. An efficient immobilization of MoFe nitrogenase via Cc-PAA allowed for the bioelectrocatalytic reduction of N<sub>3</sub><sup>–</sup>, NO<sub>2</sub><sup>–</sup>, and N<sub>2</sub> to NH<sub>3</sub>.

Any algorithm must be well characterized and validated before it is trusted to run at these scales. Smart meter data from real buildings will ultimately be required for the development, testing, and validation of these energy algorithms and processes. However, for initial development and testing, smart meter data are difficult to work with due to privacy restrictions, noise from unknown sources, data accessibility, and other concerns which can complicate algorithm development and validation. This paper describes a new methodology to generate synthetic smart meter data of electricity use in buildings using detailed building energy modeling, which aims to capture the variability and stochastics of real energy use in buildings. The methodology can create datasets tailored to represent specific scenarios with known truth and controllable amounts of synthetic noise. Knowledge of ground truth also allows the development and validation of enhanced processes which leverage building metadata, such as building type or size (floor area), in addition to smart meter data. The methodology described in this paper includes the key influencing factors of real-world building energy use including weather data, occupant-driven loads, building operation and maintenance practices, and special events. Data formats to support workflows leveraging both synthetic meter data and associated metadata are proposed and discussed. Finally, example use cases of the synthetic meter data are described to illustrate potential applications.","Springer","","National Renewable Energy Lab.

The dehumidification process is realized in desiccant coated heat exchanger with heat rejection system. The key idea behind the solution is to maximize the cooling effectiveness by creating favourable conditions for dehumidification and evaporative cooling process. This is achieved by rejecting the heat of sorption in the desiccant system and providing cold and dry air for M-Cycle air cooler, which allows the system to be powered by using low-grade heat energy at 50 °C. The analysis is performed on the basis of experimentally validated numerical models of each component combined in a unified model of the system. The goal of the study is to determine the performance of the solution under different operational conditions. In addition two types of M-Cycle air coolers (i.e. cross-flow and regenerative unit) are compared to establish which unit is more suitable as the source of cooling energy for the system. It was established that proposed system is able to provide comfortable room parameters (supply air temperature equal 17 °C and humidity ratio equal 0.010 kg/kg-da) for outdoor air temperatures ranging from 28 to 36 °C and outdoor air humidity ranging from 0.010 to 0.018 kg/kg-da. This means that the proposed solution is able to provide comfortable conditions in temperate and humid climates. Results also indicate that the system consisting of the regenerative M-Cycle HMX allows better cooling load management, offers higher thermal Coefficient of Performance (COP<sub>th</sub>) and uses less water compared to the system with the cross-flow HMX. However, the system with cross-flow heat and mass exchanger (HMX) has a relatively greater electrical Coefficient of Performance (COP<sub>el</sub>) in most cases.","Elsevier","","Argonne National Lab.

"Life cycle assessment of novel heat exchanger for dry cooling of power plants based on encapsulated phase change materials","Zhang, Lige; Spatari, Sabrina; Sun, Ying","32 ENERGY CONSERVATION, CONSUMPTION, AND UTILIZATION; power plant cooling; dry cooling technology; phase change materials; life cycle analysis; techno-economic analysis; water-energy nexus","Cooling systems in power plants account for approximately 40% of total freshwater withdrawals in the U.S. Due to dwindling access to freshwater resources worldwide, continued operation of wet cooling systems poses a significant engineering challenge. To reduce water consumption, a novel air-cooled heat exchanger has been developed using encapsulated phase change material (EPCM) for dry cooling of power plants. Compared to traditional finned-tube air-cooled condensers, this novel EPCM heat exchanger improves the heat transfer coefficient and power plant efficiency while reducing the pressure drop and cooling system cost. Life cycle assessment (LCA) and techno-economic analysis (TEA) are used to evaluate the environmental and economic performance of EPCM heat exchangers from cradle-to-grave and to compare them to wet cooling and traditional air-cooled condensers. A thermodynamic model is developed to predict the EPCM heat exchanger performance for plant-scale operations. Equipment and construction costs for heat exchangers are estimated based on design parameters obtained from the thermodynamic model. Both process-LCA and economic-input–output LCA are used to simulate and test the sensitivity of EPCM alternatives with commercial wet and dry cooling technologies. We investigate options for EPCM end-of-life management upon retiring the heat exchanger and construct a process-based LCA model to estimate a greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions credit for recycling the EPCM. The life cycle GHG emission of the novel dry cooling technology is 1.16 kg CO<sub>2 eq.</sub>/MWh compared with the 1.1–4.3 kg CO<sub>2 eq.</sub>/MWh reported for commercial dry cooling technologies and consumes 9.5 L/MWh<sub>e</sub> of water for cradle-to-gate life cycle, which is significantly lower than that of wet cooling systems. The TEA shows many advantages of EPCM cooling technology over the state-of-art dry cooling solutions. Overall, the EPCM heat exchanger provides a better alternative compared to existing dry cooling and wet cooling technologies.","Elsevier","","Electric Power Research Inst.

This study developed a bench-scale experimental system to evaluate the performance of a sorbent under controlled operation conditions. A thermostatic holder containing 3.15 g sorbent was connected to a manifold that delivered CO<sub>2</sub>-enriched air at a known temperature and relative humidity (RH). The air stream was also enriched with 0.8-2.1 ppm formaldehyde. The CO<sub>2</sub> concentration was monitored in real-time upstream and downstream of the sorbent, and integrated formaldehyde samples were collected at different times using DNPH-coated silica cartridges. Sorbent regeneration was carried out by circulating clean air in countercurrent. Almost 200 loading/regeneration cycles were performed in the span of 17 months, from which 104 were carried out at reference test conditions defined by loading with air at 25°C, 38% RH, and 1000 ppm CO<sub>2</sub>, and regenerating with air at 80°C, 3% RH and 400 ppm CO<sub>2</sub>. The working capacity decreased slightly from 43-44 mg CO<sub>2</sub> per g sorbent to 39-40 mg per g over the 17 months. The capacity increased with lower loading temperature (in the range 15-35°C) and higher regeneration temperature, between 40 and 80°C. The CO<sub>2</sub> capacity was not sensitive to the moisture content in the range 6-9 g/m<sup>3</sup>, and decreased slightly when dry air was used. Loading isothermal breakthrough curves were fitted to three simple adsorption models, verifying that pseudo-first-order kinetics appropriately describes the adsorption process. The model predicted that equilibrium capacities decreased with increasing temperature from 15 to 35°C, while adsorption rate constants slightly increased. The formaldehyde adsorption efficiency was 80%-99% in different cycles, corresponding to an average capacity of 86 ± 36 µg/g.

"Of impacts, agents, and functions: An interdisciplinary meta-review of smart home energy management systems research","McIlvennie, Claire; Sanguinetti, Angela; Pritoni, Marco","32 ENERGY CONSERVATION, CONSUMPTION, AND UTILIZATION; smart home; energy management; control; information; interdisciplinary; energy impacts; demand-side management","Smart home energy management technologies (SHEMS) have long been viewed as a promising opportunity to manage the way households use energy. Research on this topic has emerged across a variety of disciplines, focusing on different pieces of the SHEMS puzzle without offering a holistic vision of how these technologies and their users will influence home energy use moving forward. This paper presents the results of a systematic, interdisciplinary meta-review of SHEMS literature, assessing the extent to which it discusses the role of various SHEMS components in driving energy benefits. Results reveal a bias towards technical perspectives and controls approaches that seek to drive energy impacts such as load management and energy savings through SHEMS without user or third-party participation. Not only are techno-centric approaches more common, there is also a lack of integration of these approaches with user-centric, information-based solutions for driving energy impacts. Finally, these results suggest future work should investigate more holistic solutions for optimal impacts on household energy use. We hope these results will provoke a broader discussion about how to advance research on SHEMS to capitalize on their potential contributions to demand-side management initiatives moving forward.","Elsevier","","Lawrence Berkeley National Lab.

We report an electrochemical-based method for leaching valuable metals from the active materials of mixed shredded LIBs. In this process, the use electrons, as green reagent, allows the use and regeneration of Fe<sup>2+</sup> in low concentrations as substitute for hydrogen peroxide as a reducing agent. Leaching in a membrane separated two-compartment electrochemical cell contributes to decrease the acid requirements as H+ can be generated electrochemically. With this design, leaching efficiencies over 96% for the active metals (Li, Co, Mn, and Ni) were demonstrated at pulp densities up to 240 g/L. Copper present in the active material is electrowon and recovered separately. Preliminary cost analyses demonstrate ca. 80% reduction in energy and chemical costs as compared to traditional hydrometallurgical routes.","Elsevier","","Idaho National Lab.

"A methodology for generating reduced-order models for large-scale buildings using the Krylov subspace method","Kim, Donghun; Bae, Yeonjin; Yun, Sehyun; Braun, James E.","32 ENERGY CONSERVATION, CONSUMPTION, AND UTILIZATION; Building simulation; building load; reduced-order model; Krylov subspace method; model order reduction","Developing a computationally efficient but accurate building energy simulation (BES) model is important for many purposes. Model order reduction (MOR) methods are attractive and much more reliable than identification approaches, since it directly extract a lower-dimensional model from a detailed physics-based model without any pre-simulations. However, because of computational and data storage requirements, there are challenges of applying these methods to a large-scale building. To overcome the problem, this work introduces the Krylov subspace method to the building science field. Technical issues of applying the method to building applications are addressed and a suitable algorithm that overcomes those challenges is presented. Furthermore, to demonstrate the reliability of the algorithm, comparisons between the resulted reduced-order model (ROM) and a high-fidelity model from a commercial BES software for a 60-zone case study building are provided. The ROM was a factor of 100 faster than the high fidelity model but with high accuracy.","Taylor & Francis","","Oak Ridge National Lab.

This paper reviews 23 regions’ building energy codes and standards by first comparing their quantitative aspects and then analyzing their mandated rules and approaches. While the present paper focuses on offices, general recommendations are applicable to other building types as well. The review revealed a wide range of occupant-related values, approaches, and attitudes. For example, code-specified occupant density varies by nearly a factor of three between different codes. This underlines the need for development of advancement in occupant behavior modeling approaches for future occupant-centric building performance codes and standards. Moreover, occupants are often referred to only implicitly; underlying expectations about energy-saving occupant behavior from building occupants varies greatly; and, only a few codes address occupant feedback and system usability. Based on the findings of the review, a set of initial recommendations for future building energy codes is proposed.","Elsevier","","Lawrence Berkeley National Lab.

Demand growth is further accelerated by the implementation of climate policies and strategies to replace fossil resources with biomass. There are, however, concerns about the size of the prospective biomass demand and the environmental and social consequences of the corresponding resource mobilization, especially concerning impacts from the associated land-use change. Strategically integrating perennials into landscapes dominated by intensive agriculture can, for example, improve biodiversity, reduce soil erosion and nutrient emissions to water, increase soil carbon, enhance pollination, and avoid or mitigate flooding events. Such ""multifunctional perennial production systems"" can thus contribute to improving overall land-use sustainability, while maintaining or increasing overall biomass productivity in the landscape. Seven different cases in different world regions are here reviewed to exemplify and evaluate (a) multifunctional production systems that have been established to meet emerging bioenergy demands, and (b) efforts to identify locations where the establishment of perennial crops will be particularly beneficial. An important barrier towards wider implementation of multifunctional systems is the lack of markets, or policies, compensating producers for enhanced ecosystem services and other environmental benefits. This deficiency is particularly important since prices for fossil-based fuels are low relative to bioenergy production costs. Without such compensation, multifunctional perennial production systems will be unlikely to contribute to the development of a sustainable bioeconomy.","Wiley","","Oak Ridge National Lab.

"A Comprehensive Analysis of Energy and Daylighting Impact of Window Shading Systems and Control Strategies on Commercial Buildings in the United States","Kunwar, Niraj; Bhandari, Mahabir S.","32 ENERGY CONSERVATION, CONSUMPTION, AND UTILIZATION; window attachments; shading device; automated controls; daylighting; energy; EnergyPlus™","Commercial buildings consume approximately 1.9 EJ of energy in the United States, 50% of which is for heating, cooling, and lighting applications. It is estimated that windows contribute up to 34% of the energy used for heating and cooling. However, window retrofits are not often undertaken to increase energy efficiency because of the high cost and disruptive nature of window installation. Highly efficient window technologies would also need shading devices for glare prevention and visual comfort. An automated window shading system with an appropriate control strategy is a technology that can reduce energy demand, maintain occupant comfort, and enhance the aesthetics and privacy of the built environment. However, the benefits of the automated shades currently used by the shading industry are not well studied. The topic merits an analysis that will help building owners, designers and engineers, and utilities make informed decisions using knowledge of the impact of this technology on energy consumption, peak demand, daylighting, and occupant comfort. This study uses integrated daylight and whole-building energy simulation to evaluate the performance of various control strategies that the shading industry uses in commercial office buildings. The analysis was performed for three different vintages of medium office buildings at six different locations in United States. The results obtained show the control strategies enabled cooling energy savings of up to 40% using exterior shading, and lighting energy savings of up to 25%. The control strategies described can help building engineers and researchers explore different control methods used to control shading in actual buildings but rarely discussed in the literature. This information will give researchers the opportunity to investigate potential improvements in current technologies and their performance.","MDPI AG","","Oak Ridge National Lab.

However, there has been surprisingly little research on building interfaces and how their design, context (e.g., location), and underlying logic impact their usability and occupants’ perceived control, as well as the resulting comfort and energy performance. This means that research is needed to better understand how occupants interact with building interfaces in both commercial and residential applications; both applications are important to address as there are many differences in interface types, level of control and understanding, and even expectations of engagement. Herein, this paper provides a cursory review and discussion of select common building interfaces: windows, window shades/blinds, thermostats, and lighting controls. The goal of this paper is to review literature related to these human-building interfaces to explore interface characteristics, current design and use challenges, and relationships between building interfaces and occupants. Human-building interface interactions are complex, more research is needed to understand design, use, and characteristics. Common themes emerged throughout the literature review to explain occupant interactions (or lack of interactions) with building interfaces, which included thermal and visual comfort, ease and access of control, interface/control placement, poor interface/control design, lack of understanding, and social-behavioral dynamics.","Elsevier","","Lawrence Berkeley National Lab.

The developed controller can assist BEVs while traversing signalized intersections with minimal energy consumption. The calculation of the optimal vehicle trajectory is formulated as an optimization problem under the constraints of (1) vehicle acceleration/deceleration behavior, defined by a vehicle dynamics model; (2) vehicle energy consumption behavior, defined by a BEV energy consumption model; and (3) the relationship between vehicle speed, location, and signal timing, defined by vehicle characteristics and signal phase and timing (SPaT) data shared under a connected vehicle environment. The optimal speed trajectory is computed in real-time by the proposed BEV eco-CACC-I controller, so that a BEV can follow the optimal speed while negotiating a signalized intersection. The proposed BEV controller was tested in a case study to investigate its performance under various speed limits, roadway grades, and signal timings. In addition, a comparison of the optimal speed trajectories for BEVs and internal combustion engine vehicles (ICEVs) was conducted to investigate the impact of vehicle engine types on eco-driving solutions. Lastly, the proposed controller was implemented in microscopic traffic simulation software to test its networkwide performance. The test results from an arterial corridor with three signalized intersections demonstrate that the proposed controller can effectively reduce stop-and-go traffic in the vicinity of signalized intersections and that the BEV Eco-CACC-I controller produces average savings of 9.3% in energy consumption and 3.9% in vehicle delays.","MDPI AG","","Virginia Polytechnic Inst. and State Univ.

Molecular dynamics simulations of the liquid state revealed that an increased dipole moment reduces cation-cation repulsions through dipole-dipole alignment. This was believed to reduce the liquid phase enthalpy, which would tend to lower the melting point of the IL. Here, we also test this principle by replacing hydrogen atoms with fluorine atoms at selected positions within the cation. This allows us to alter the electrostatics of the cation without substantially affecting the sterics. Furthermore, the strength of the dipole moment can be controlled by choosing different positions within the cation for replacement. We studied variants of four different parent cations paired with bistriflimide and determined their melting points, and enthalpies and entropies of fusion through DSC experiments. The decreases in the melting point were determined to be enthalpically driven. We found that the dipole moment of the cation, as determined by quantum chemical calculations, is inversely correlated with the melting point of the given compound. Molecular dynamics simulations of the crystalline and solid states of two isomers showed differences in their enthalpies of fusion that closely matched those seen experimentally. Moreover, this reduction in the enthalpy of fusion was determined to be caused by an increase in the enthalpy of the crystalline state. We provide evidence that dipole-dipole interactions between cations leads to the formation of cationic domains in the crystalline state. These cationic associations partially block favourable cation–anion interactions, which are recovered upon melting. If, however, the dipole- dipole interactions between cations is too strong they have a tendency to form glasses. This study provides a design rule for lowering the melting point of structurally similar ILs by altering their dipole moment.","Royal Society of Chemistry","","Univ. of South Alabama, Mobile, AL (United States)","USDOE Office of Science (SC), Basic Energy Sciences (BES); National Science Foundation (NSF); USDOE Office of Energy Efficiency and Renewable Energy (EERE), Energy Efficiency Office.

However, these interactions are either neglected or oversimplified in urban building energy modeling. We developed a new feature in EnergyPlus to explicitly consider this term in the surface heat balance calculations and developed an algorithm to batch calculating the surrounding surfaces’ view factors using a ray-tracing technique. We conducted a case study with a district in the Chicago downtown area to evaluate the longwave radiant heat exchange effects between urban buildings. Results show that the impact of the longwave radiant effects on annual energy use ranges from 0.1% to 3.3% increase for cooling and 0.3% to 3.6% decrease for heating, varying among individual buildings. At the district level, the total energy demand increases by 1.39% for cooling and decreases 0.45% for heating. We also observe the longwave radiation can increase the exterior surface temperature by up to 10 °C for certain exterior surfaces. These findings justify a detailed and accurate way to consider the thermal interactions between buildings in an urban context to inform urban planning and design.","MDPI AG","","Lawrence Berkeley National Lab.

A research project aiming to identify opportunities to reduce energy consumption in new single-family residential construction by increasing compliance with the building energy code was conducted in several states of the United States. The study was comprised of three phases: (1) a baseline study to document typical practice and identify opportunities for improvement based on empirical data gathered from the field; (2) an education and training phase targeting the opportunities identified; and (3) a post-study to assess whether a reduction in average state-wide energy use could be achieved following the education and training phase. We proposed a novel methodology based on large-scale building energy simulation inferred by limited field data to assess the performance of a large population of homes. This paper presents the methodology, findings, and results of this study. The state-wide average energy consumption decreased at Phase III from Phase I for five of the seven states involved in the analysis.

"Factors Influencing Willingness to Pool in Ride-Hailing Trips","Hou, Yi; Garikapati, Venu; Weigl, Dustin; Henao, Alejandro; Moniot, Matthew; Sperling, Joshua","32 ENERGY CONSERVATION, CONSUMPTION, AND UTILIZATION; Transportation Network Companies; TNCs; ride-hailing; ride-sharing; ride pooling; willingness to pool","In the past decade, transportation network companies (TNCs) such as Uber, Lyft, and Via have established themselves as a viable transportation alternative to other modes. However, the popularity of these services has come with a fair share of criticism for their negative externalities such as increasing vehicle miles traveled and congestion in cities. Pooled ride-hailing trips, in which all or a part of two individual (or group) trips are combined in and served by a single vehicle, have the potential to reduce these externalities. Pooling of rides is an effective solution to reduce congestion and travel cost, but pooled rides still represent a small percentage of the total trips served (and miles driven) by TNCs relative to single-occupancy (and without customer) vehicle miles. Both TNCs and cities alike will benefit from understanding what factors encourage or deter pooling a ride-hailing trip. In this study, newly available Chicago transportation network provider data were explored to identify the extent to which different socioeconomic, spatiotemporal, and trip characteristics affect willingness to pool (WTP) in ride-hailing trips. Furthermore, multivariate linear regression and machine-learning models were employed to understand and predict WTP based on location, time, and trip factors. The results show intuitive trends, with income level at drop-off and pickup locations and airport trips as the most important predictors of WTP. Results from this study can help TNCs and cities devise strategies that increase pooled ride-hailing, thereby reducing adverse transportation and energy impacts from ride-hailing modes.","National Academy of Sciences, Engineering and Medicine","","National Renewable Energy Lab.

"Nexus of thermal resilience and energy efficiency in buildings: A case study of a nursing home","Sun, Kaiyu; Specian, Michael; Hong, Tianzhen","32 ENERGY CONSERVATION, CONSUMPTION, AND UTILIZATION; Energy efficiency; resilience; extreme heat; heat index; buildings; occupant health","Extreme weather events become more frequent and severe due to climate change. Although energy efficiency technologies can influence thermal resilience of buildings, they are traditionally studied separately, and their interconnections are rarely quantified. This study developed a methodology of modeling and analysis to provide insights into the nexus of thermal resilience and energy efficiency of buildings. In this work, we conducted a case study of a real nursing home in Florida, where 12 patients died during Hurricane Irma in 2017 due to HVAC system power loss, to understand and quantify how passive and active energy efficiency measures (EEMs) can improve thermal resilience to reduce heat-exposure risk of patients. Results show that passive measures of opening windows and doors for natural ventilation, as well as miscellaneous load reduction, are very effective in eliminating the extreme dangerous occasions. However, to maintain safe conditions, active measures such as on-site power generators and thermal storage are also needed. The nursing home was further studied by changing its location to two other cities: San Francisco (mild climate) and Chicago (cold winter and hot summer). Results revealed that the EEMs' impacts on thermal resilience vary significantly by climate and building characteristics. The study also estimated the costs of EEMs to help stakeholders prioritize the measures. Passive measures that may not save energy may greatly improve thermal resilience, and thus should be considered in building design or retrofit. Findings from this study indicate energy efficiency technologies should be evaluated not only by their energy savings performance but also by their influence on a building's resilience to extreme weather events.","Elsevier","","Lawrence Berkeley National Lab.

This paper reviews and summarizes the impact of lighting environment on task performance, specifically for the built environment audience. Existing studies included a variety of performance tests on cognitive performance and perception, visual acuity and reaction, memory, reasoning, and labor productivity. Illuminance, luminance ratio and correlated color temperature were found to affect performance in different ways, reflecting the impact of experimental techniques, conditions, performance evaluation methods used and data analysis methods. These were reviewed and categorized, with discussion on limitations related to sample size, modeling approach, carryover effects and other factors affecting individual differences in performance, with recommendations for future improvement. Although no universal conclusions can be made, in general, task performance seems to improve with higher illuminances, contrast ratios in the range of 7–11:1 (while always making sure that glare will not occur in the space) and higher correlated color temperature, while spectral tuning in the red or blue wavelengths has also shown positive effects. To obtain more generic evidence, future studies should be more consistent in terms of experimental procedures and overall light conditions, and also consider the effects of vertical illuminance, daylight provision/control, and outside views on task performance. Finally, studying performance with multi-factorial designs in a human-centered optimized manner (such as deploying variable lighting scenarios optimized for various tasks) can lead to deeper understanding of lighting effects on task performance, and ultimately to improved lighting design and operation in buildings overall.","Elsevier","","National Renewable Energy Lab.

Although hysteresis losses that limit these applications can be reduced through careful control of alloy composition, compositional tuning can also unfavorably influence transformation temperatures and magnetocaloric coupling strength. Hence, exploration of additional processing variables enabling independent control of transformation properties is crucial. In this work, we investigate the role of thermal history as an additional processing variable, exploiting thermally-activated mechanisms to control properties of non-diffusive transformations in (Mn, Fe)<sub>2</sub>(P, Si) alloys. In so doing, we report an unusual transformation-splitting phenomenon following annealing at intermediate times, where a single well-defined magneto-structural transformation evolves towards a multi-step transformation with individual steps occurring at multiple distinct temperatures. Here, on longer annealing at the same temperatures, single-step transformation behavior is recovered. Through additional magnetic and crystallographic characterization, we show that the thermal history-controlled multi-step behavior results from sluggish thermally-activated diffusion. The two-step transformation corresponds to non-equilibrium bimodal composition distributions in the transforming phase, and these develop through a dynamic re-equilibration process as the alloy passes relatively slowly between different thermal equilibria. Together, these results suggest that thermal history primarily controls the transformation properties of (Mn, Fe)<sub>2</sub>(P, Si) alloys indirectly through the composition of one or more transforming phases. Additional investigations are needed to develop thermal history processing for decoupling hysteresis control from other transformation properties.","IOP Publishing","","Louisiana State Univ., Baton Rouge, LA (United States)","USDOE Office of Science (SC), Basic Energy Sciences (BES); US National Science Foundation, Division of Civil, Mechanical and Manufacturing Innovation (CMMI) Program; NSF Graduate Research Fellowship Program","","United States","2020-03-18T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: Journal of Physics.

"The reservoir network: A new network topology for district heating and cooling","Sommer, Tobias; Sulzer, Matthias; Wetter, Michael; Sotnikov, Artem; Mennel, Stefan; Stettler, Christoph","32 ENERGY CONSERVATION, CONSUMPTION, AND UTILIZATION; district heating networks; district cooling networks; modelica; prosumer; reservoir network; piping costs","Thermal district networks are effective solutions to substitute fossil fuels with renewable energy sources for heating and cooling. Moreover, thermal networking of buildings allows energy efficiency to be further increased. The waste heat from cooling can be reused for heating in thermal district systems. Because of bidirectional energy flows between prosumers, thermal networks require new hydraulic concepts. In this work, we present a novel network topology for simultaneous heating and cooling: the reservoir network. The reservoir network is robust in operation due to hydraulic decoupling of transfer stations, integrates heat sources and heat sinks at various temperature levels and is flexible in terms of network expansion. Furthermore, we used Modelica simulations to compare the new single-pipe reservoir network to a basecase double-pipe network, taking yearly demand profiles of different building types for heating and cooling. The electric energy consumed by the heat pumps and circulations pumps differs between the reservoir and base case networks by less than 1%. However, if the reservoir network is operated with constant instead of variable mass flow rate, the total electrical consumption can increase by 48% compared to the base case. As with any other network topology, the design and control of such networks is crucial to achieving energy efficient operation. Investment costs for piping and trenching depend on the district layout and dimensioning of the network. If a ring layout is applied in a district, the reservoir network with its single-pipe configuration is more economical than other topologies. For a linear layout, the piping costs are slightly higher for the reservoir network than for the base case because of larger pipe diameters.","Elsevier","","Lawrence Berkeley National Lab.

To help fill this gap, this paper explores relationships between the room AC efficiency performance metrics of different regions—including China, the European Union, India, Japan, South Korea, and the United States—using performance data for split room AC models. We use these interregional conversion relationships to estimate the performance of > 6000 AC models, including reversible heat pumps, in efficiency metrics used in the six economies as well as the International Organization for Standardization (ISO) 16,358 metric. Our results suggest a way to identify the potential for improving AC efficiency policies in regional markets.

However, their participation remains low in real-life. One major impediment for popularizing DR in buildings is the lack of cost-effective automation systems that can be widely adopted. Existing optimization-based smart building control algorithms suffer from high costs on both building-specific modeling and on-demand computing resources. To tackle these issues, this paper proposes a cost-effective edge-cloud integrated solution using reinforcement learning (RL). Beside RL’s ability to solve sequential optimal decision-making problems, its adaptability to easy-to-obtain building models and the off-line learning feature are likely to reduce the controller’s implementation cost. Using a surrogate building model learned automatically from building operation data, an RL agent learns an optimal control policy on cloud infrastructure, and the policy is then distributed to edge devices for execution. Simulation results demonstrate the control efficacy and the learning efficiency in buildings of different sizes. A preliminary cost analysis on a 4-zone commercial building shows the annual cost for optimal policy training is only 2.25% of the DR incentive received. Results of this study show a possible approach with higher return on investment for buildings to participate in DR programs.","IEEE","","National Renewable Energy Lab.

"Electricity demand of non-residential buildings in Mexico","Chatellier Lorentzen, Diego M. P.; McNeil, Michael A.","32 ENERGY CONSERVATION, CONSUMPTION, AND UTILIZATION; Mexico; Buildings; Non-Residential; Energy efficiency; Electricity","By now, there is a consensus that non-residential buildings (commercial and public buildings) present important opportunities for reducing cost, fuel inputs and greenhouse gas emissions, especially because of their intensive use of electricity. Till now, however, in emerging economies energy efficiency opportunities in buildings are typically more focused on households. In Mexico, official government statistics suggest that the non-residential sector electricity demand is low compared to the residential and industrial sectors, but previous studies suggest that non-residential electricity use is underestimated due to the reliance of electricity tariff classes, which may not adequately distinguish large commercial buildings from industrial facilities. The analysis presented here follows the same general bottom-up methodology as two recent studies, but enhances them with a more rigorous and up-to-date assessment of electricity drivers of building sub-types from a variety of sources. The result is a more reliable estimate of non-residential electricity demand by building sub-type and climate zone. Non-residential buildings electricity demand in 2017 is found to be 66.9 TWh, which is nearly three times the official estimate of 22.6 TWh in the same year. Such a large discrepancy likely distorts the picture of energy use in the country and may lead to an under-emphasis by government and private sector actors in managing energy use in this important sector.","Elseiver","","Lawrence Berkeley National Lab.

"Design and analysis of optimal pre-cooling in residential buildings","Wang, Junke; Tang, Choon Yik; Song, Li","32 ENERGY CONSERVATION, CONSUMPTION, AND UTILIZATION; pre-cooling; HVAC control optimization; home thermal properties; utility rate structure; weather conditions","Existing pre-cooling strategies provide a means of shifting or reducing the peak demand and/or energy cost in residential buildings. However, majority of them are rule-based and therefore may not be optimal in terms of cost saving, leaving room for improvement. In this paper, an integer linear programming problem that accounts for the thermal properties of a specific home, HVAC system capacity, utility rate structure, and weather conditions and makes use of a home thermal model is formulated. This problem determines the HVAC on/off control signal that minimizes the 24-h energy cost while maintaining thermal comfort and calculates the corresponding optimal indoor air temperature. The model is constructed using home thermal properties identified via data training in real-time. Through simulation, the energy performance of the proposed optimal pre-cooling strategy is investigated and compared with three rule-based operation strategies from the literature. It is found that the optimal strategy requires the least energy consumption without sacrificing thermal comfort. The superb energy performance of the optimal strategy is attributed to a longer runtime of the HVAC system in cool outdoor air conditions and to the elimination of deadband in HVAC operation, which is required by the rule-based strategies, to allow the indoor air temperature to stay near the thermal comfort upper bound as much as possible. In terms of energy cost, the rule-based operation strategies require 3.52, 1.90, and 2.79, respectively, while the optimal strategy only requires 1.52. These figures represent a saving of 56.82%, 20.00%, and 45.52%, respectively. The results suggest that the optimal strategy is indeed significantly more effective than the existing rule-based operation strategies.","Elsevier","","Univ. of Oklahoma, Norman, OK (United States)","USDOE Office of Energy Efficiency and Renewable Energy (EERE), Energy Efficiency Office.

The achievable impact from the widespread installation of such technologies is, however, not clearly established. This is mainly because the degree of this impact highly depends on the inherently uncertain environmental and climate factors, as well as the unknown adoption rates of these technologies, which in turn depend on different characteristics of decision makers and interactions among them. To that end, this study aims to investigate the diffusion rate of these green technologies under uncertainties caused by climate change, characteristics of adopters, and their interactions. An integrated framework is developed to capture the interplay between financial and attitudinal aspects, as well as the uncertainties due to both the stochastic nature of system parameters and the interactions among agents involving human beings. Specifically, this framework consists of a integer programming model to optimize the green roof and/or photovoltaic panel installation settings for a given building under climate change uncertainty, and an agent-based model to factor in the role of human behavior and interactions. A case study for the city of Knoxville, TN, is presented to evaluate the effects of different policies on the diffusion rate of the green technologies of interest. The results show that the affordability of green technologies and public awareness are the key drivers of the adoption of these technologies, which highlight the important role of the decision makers in impacting the diffusion rate.","Elsevier","","Oak Ridge National Lab.

Correspondingly, automated fault detection and diagnostics (FDD) algorithms are designed to identify the presence of operational faults and their root causes. A diversity of techniques is used for FDD spanning physical models, black box, and rule-based approaches. A persistent challenge has been the lack of common datasets and test methods to benchmark their performance accuracy. This article presents a first of its kind public dataset with ground-truth data on the presence and absence of building faults. This dataset spans a range of seasons and operational conditions and encompasses multiple building system types. It contains information on fault severity, as well as data points reflective of the measurements in building control systems that FDD algorithms typically have access to. The data were created using simulation models as well as experimental test facilities, and will be expanded over time.","Nature Publishing Group","","Pacific Northwest National Lab.

"A Critical Exploration of the Efficiency Impacts of Demand Response From HVAC in Commercial Buildings","MacDonald, Jason S.; Vrettos, Evangelos; Callaway, Duncan S.","32 ENERGY CONSERVATION, CONSUMPTION, AND UTILIZATION; Battery analogy; demand response (DR); energy cost; round-trip efficiency (RTE)","Increasing quantities of renewable energy generation has yielded a need for greater energy storage capacity in power systems. Thermal storage in variable air volume (VAV) heating, ventilation, and air conditioning (HVAC) in commercial buildings has been identified as an inexpensive source of grid storage, but the true costs are not known. Recent literature explores the inefficiency associated with providing grid services from these HVAC-based demand response (DR) resources by employing a battery analogy to calculate round-trip efficiency (RTE). Results vary significantly across studies and in some cases reported efficiencies are strikingly low. This article has three objectives to address these prior results. First, we synthesize and expand on insights into existing literature by systematically exploring the potential causes for the discrepancies in results. We reinforce previous work indicating baseline modeling may drive differences across studies and deduce that control accuracy plays a role in the major differences between experiments and simulation. Second, we discuss why the RTE metric is problematic for DR applications, discuss another proposed metric, additional energy consumption (AEC), and propose an extension, which we call uninstructed energy consumption (UEC), to evaluate DR performance. Finally, we explore the merits of different metrics using experimental data and highlight UEC's reduced sensitivity to the characteristics of the DR signal than previously proposed metrics.","Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers","","Lawrence Berkeley National Lab.

"Future western U.S. building electricity consumption in response to climate and population drivers: A comparative study of the impact of model structure","Burleyson, Casey D.; Iyer, Gokul C.; Hejazi, Mohamad I.; Kim, Son H.; Kyle, Page; Rice, Jennie S.; Smith, Amanda D.; Taylor, Zachary Todd; Voisin, Nathalie; Xie, Yulong","32 ENERGY CONSERVATION, CONSUMPTION, AND UTILIZATION; buildings; electricity consumption; population change; climate change; multi-scale modeling","Projections of future building electricity consumption are used in a variety of fields and for a variety of purposes, from energy utility investment decisions to global climate assessments. Existing approaches to modeling building electricity consumption similarly span a range of structural methodologies, spatial resolutions, and temporal scales, potentially leading to divergent projections. This paper compares how two such models with different structures and resolutions respond to a common set of population and climate drivers in the western U.S. The BEND model simulates hourly residential and commercial building electricity consumption at the county scale by weighting the results of hourly simulations of representative building types. For the region assessed in this study, BEND performs approximately 100,000 unique building simulations. In contrast, the projected electricity demand in GCAM-USA is determined for each state, year, sector (residential, commercial) and service (e.g., heating, cooling, and others), based on population, income, technology, energy prices, and average annual climate, among other factors. This paper compares projections by aggregating the two models’ results to a common resolution: annual residential and commercial building electricity consumption by state. The results show a high degree of consistency in most states. Both models show similar responses to future projected population change and climate change, with population change having the larger impact between the two. State-level annual building electricity consumption appears relatively insensitive to model structure and resolution. Differences are primarily due to how the models capture changes in the aggregate energy efficiency of the building stock as it evolves over time.","Elsevier","","Pacific Northwest National Lab.

Physics-based prediction models of building thermal load are constrained by the model and input complexity. In this study, we developed 12 data-driven models (7 shallow learning, 2 deep learning, and 3 heuristic methods) to predict building thermal load and compared shallow machine learning and deep learning. The 12 prediction models were compared with the measured cooling demand. It was found XGBoost (Extreme Gradient Boost) and LSTM (Long Short Term Memory) provided the most accurate load prediction in the shallow and deep learning category, and both outperformed the best baseline model, which uses the previous day's data for prediction. Then, we discussed how the prediction horizon and input uncertainty would influence the load prediction accuracy. Major conclusions are twofold: first, LSTM performs well in short-term prediction (1 h ahead) but not in long term prediction (24 h ahead), because the sequential information becomes less relevant and accordingly not so useful when the prediction horizon is long. Second, the presence of weather forecast uncertainty deteriorates XGBoost's accuracy and favors LSTM, because the sequential information makes the model more robust to input uncertainty. Training the model with the uncertain rather than accurate weather data could enhance the model's robustness. Finally, our findings have two implications for practice. First, LSTM is recommended for short-term load prediction given that weather forecast uncertainty is unavoidable. Second, XGBoost is recommended for long term prediction, and the model should be trained with the presence of input uncertainty.","Elsevier","","Lawrence Berkeley National Lab.

We developed a fusion protein containing a solubilizing maltose-binding protein domain, PhoCl, and two copies of the RGG domain. Several seconds of illumination at 405 nm is sufficient to cleave PhoCl, removing the solubilization domain and enabling RGG-driven coacervation within minutes in cellularsized water-in-oil emulsions.

"An assessment of the load modifying potential of model predictive controlled dynamic facades within the California context","Gehbauer, Christoph; Blum, David H.; Wang, Taoning; Lee, Eleanor S.","32 ENERGY CONSERVATION, CONSUMPTION, AND UTILIZATION; model predictive controls; switchable windows; dynamic facades; daylighting; windows; building energy efficiency; controller in the loop","California is making major strides towards meeting its greenhouse gas emission reduction goals with the transformation of its electrical grid to accommodate renewable generation, aggressive promotion of building energy efficiency, and increased emphasis on moving toward electrification of end uses (e.g., residential heating, etc.). As a result of this activity, the State is faced with significant challenges of systemwide resource adequacy, power quality and grid reliability that could be addressed in part with demand responsive (DR) load modifying strategies using controllable building technologies. Dynamic facades have the ability to potentially shift and shed loads at critical times of the day in combination with daylighting and HVAC controls. This study explores the technical potential of dynamic facades to support net load shape objectives. A model predictive controller (MPC) was designed based on reduced order thermal (Modelica) and window (Radiance) models. Using an automated workflow (involving JModelica.org and MPCPy), these models were converted and differentiated to formulate a non-linear optimization problem. A gradient-based, non-linear programming problem solver (IPOPT) was used to derive an optimal control strategy, then a post-optimization step was used to convert the solution to a discrete state for facade actuation. Continuous state modulation of the façade was also modeled. The performance of the MPC controller with and without activation of thermal mass was evaluated in a south-facing perimeter office zone with a three-zone electrochromic window for a clear sunny week during summer and winter periods in Oakland and Burbank, California. MPC strategies reduced total energy cost by 9–28% and critical coincident peak demand was reduced by up to 0.58 W/ft<sup>2</sup>-floor or 19–43% in the 4.6 m (15 ft) deep south zone on sunny summer days in Oakland compared to state-of-the-art heuristic control. Similar savings were achieved for the hotter, Burbank climate in Southern California. This outcome supports the argument that MPC control of dynamic facades can provide significant electricity cost reductions and net load management capabilities of benefit to both the building owner and evolving electrical grid.","Elsevier","","Lawrence Berkeley National Lab.

Meanwhile, the market success of PEVs depends on many aspects. The study reported herein integrates one’s use of charging infrastructure at home, public place and workplace into the market dynamics analysis tool, New Energy and Oil Consumption Credits (NEOCC) model, to systematically assess the charging infrastructure (home parking ratio, public charging opportunity, and charging costs) impact on PEV ownership costs and analyze how the PEV market shares may be affected by the attributes of the charging infrastructure. Compared to the charging infrastructure, the impact of battery costs is incontrovertibly decisive on PEV market shares, the charging infrastructure is still non-negligible in the PEV market dynamics. The simulation results find that the public charging infrastructure has more effectiveness on promoting the PEV sales in the PEV emerging market than it does in the PEV mature market. However, the improvement of charging infrastructure does not necessarily lead to a larger PEV market if the charging infrastructure incentives do not coordinate well with other PEV policies. Besides, the increase of public charging opportunities has limited motivations on the growth of public PEV fleets, which are highly correlated to the number of public fast charging stations or outlets. It also finds that more home parking spaces can stimulate more sales of personal plug-in hybrid electric vehicles instead of personal battery electric vehicles.","Elsevier","","Oak Ridge National Lab.

Many studies have examined ways of reducing peak power demand, including modification of room air temperature setpoints or reduction of lighting levels. However, very few or no studies have examined the peak power reduction resource offered by temporary curtailment of building ventilation systems. For this reason, we conducted a simulation campaign in which we examined the resource offered by temporary ventilation curtailment in commercial buildings of different use types across the United States and in residences in the state of California, with the essential constraint that any changes resulted in air quality acceptable to occupants through additional ventilation to compensate for the curtailment. To do this, we employed previously validated building models implemented in the airflow and contaminant transport tool CONTAM and building thermal and systems modeling tool EnergyPlus, in some cases co-simulated. Overall, results show savings are highly dependent on building type and climate but range from 0–2 W/ft<sup>2</sup> and up to 40% of total peak building power demand. Depending on building type, this power shed can be conducted for 1.5–8 h before acute exposure or odor concerns are expected, assuming a safety factor of 2. This reduction is of the same magnitude as that offered by thermal control strategies such as setpoint increase, or from lighting reduction strategies.","Elsevier","","Lawrence Berkeley National Lab.

In this study, we provide fundamental insight on the operation of TEGs in realistic environments by illustrating the combinatory effect of thermoelectric material properties, device boundary conditions, and environmental thermal resistivity on TEG performance in conjunction with the module parameters. Using numerical and experimental studies, we demonstrate the existence of a critical heat transfer coefficient that dramatically affects the design and performance of TEGs. Results provide a set of concrete design criteria for developing efficient TEGs that meet the metrics for field deployments. High-performance TEGs demonstrated in this study generated up to 28% higher power and 162% higher power per unit mass of thermoelectric materials as compared to the commercial module deployed for low-grade waste heat recovery.

"A novel improved model for building energy consumption prediction based on model integration","Wang, Ran; Lu, Shilei; Feng, Wei","32 ENERGY CONSERVATION, CONSUMPTION, AND UTILIZATION; Building energy prediction; model integration; data mining; robustness","Building energy consumption prediction plays an irreplaceable role in energy planning, management, and conservation. Constantly improving the performance of prediction models is the key to ensuring the efficient operation of energy systems. Moreover, accuracy is no longer the only factor in revealing model performance, it is more important to evaluate the model from multiple perspectives, considering the characteristics of engineering applications. Based on the idea of model integration, this paper proposes a novel improved integration model (stacking model) that can be used to forecast building energy consumption. The stacking model combines advantages of various base prediction algorithms and forms them into “meta-features” to ensure that the final model can observe datasets from different spatial and structural angles. Two cases are used to demonstrate practical engineering applications of the stacking model. A comparative analysis is performed to evaluate the prediction performance of the stacking model in contrast with existing well-known prediction models including Random Forest, Gradient Boosted Decision Tree, Extreme Gradient Boosting, Support Vector Machine, and K-Nearest Neighbor. The results indicate that the stacking method achieves better performance than other models, regarding accuracy (improvement of 9.5%–31.6% for Case A and 16.2%–49.4% for Case B), generalization (improvement of 6.7%–29.5% for Case A and 7.1%-34.6% for Case B), and robustness (improvement of 1.5%–34.1% for Case A and 1.8%–19.3% for Case B). The proposed model enriches the diversity of algorithm libraries of empirical models.","Elsevier","","Lawrence Berkeley National Lab.

This study systematically surveyed how machine learning has been applied at different stages of building life cycle. By conducting a literature search on the Web of Knowledge platform, we found 9579 papers in this field and selected 153 papers for an in-depth review. The number of published papers is increasing year by year, with a focus on building design, operation, and control. However, no study was found using machine learning in building commissioning. There are successful pilot studies on fault detection and diagnosis of HVAC equipment and systems, load prediction, energy baseline estimate, load shape clustering, occupancy prediction, and learning occupant behaviors and energy use patterns. None of the existing studies were adopted broadly by the building industry, due to common challenges including (1) lack of large scale labeled data to train and validate the model, (2) lack of model transferability, which limits a model trained with one data-rich building to be used in another building with limited data, (3) lack of strong justification of costs and benefits of deploying machine learning, and (4) the performance might not be reliable and robust for the stated goals, as the method might work for some buildings but could not be generalized to others. Finally, findings from the study can inform future machine learning research to improve occupant comfort, energy efficiency, demand flexibility, and resilience of buildings, as well as to inspire young researchers in the field to explore multidisciplinary approaches that integrate building science, computing science, data science, and social science.","Elsevier","","Lawrence Berkeley National Lab.

"Identification of drivers, benefits, and challenges of ISO 50001 through case study content analysis","Fuchs, Heidi; Aghajanzadeh, Arian; Therkelsen, Peter","32 ENERGY CONSERVATION, CONSUMPTION, AND UTILIZATION; energy management; ISO 50001; content analysis; energy savings; greenhouse gas emissions","An expanding body of research is defining drivers, benefits, and challenges of adopting ISO 50001 energy management systems. The Clean Energy Ministerial's Energy Management Leadership Awards program requires ISO 50001-certified organizations to develop case studies of their implementation experience. 72 recent case studies spanning multiple economic sectors provide a unique global look at implementation from certified organizations' perspectives. This dataset was investigated through content analysis of phrases related to motivations and goals, the role of management and the organization, benefits achieved, keys to success, and challenges. This paper presents findings from this quantitative analysis of “codes” assigned to phrases that capture their meaning. While organizations adopted ISO 50001 for different motives and saw myriad benefits beyond energy savings and associated greenhouse gas emissions reductions, commonalities exist. The most frequently identified drivers are existing values and goals, environmental sustainability, and government incentives or regulations. Findings also include: obtaining and sustaining top management support is critical; top benefits mentioned are cost savings, productivity, and operational improvements; and the primary barrier is lacking a culture of energy management. Policymakers and others looking to accelerate ISO 50001 uptake can use these findings to highlight benefits and incentives that will resonate with corporate decisionmakers worldwide.","Elsevier","","Lawrence Berkeley National Lab.

"Thermodynamic analysis and optimization of supercritical carbon dioxide Brayton cycles for use with low-grade geothermal heat sources","Ruiz-Casanova, Eduardo; Rubio-Maya, Carlos; Pacheco-Ibarra, J. Jesús; Ambriz-Díaz, Víctor M.; Romero, Carlos E.; Wang, Xingchao","32 ENERGY CONSERVATION, CONSUMPTION, AND UTILIZATION; Brayton cycle; geothermal energy; low-grade heat; optimization; supercritical carbon dioxide; thermodynamic analysis","The transcritical carbon dioxide Rankine cycle has emerged as an alternative for power generation in low-grade heat applications. However, the low heat rejection temperatures required for condensing the carbon dioxide is almost prohibitive for many locations. A simple solution is the adoption of a supercritical carbon dioxide Brayton cycle which does not need such low temperature heat sinks. This power cycle has been poorly studied previously in low-grade heat applications. Therefore, with the aim of determining the performance and feasibility of the supercritical carbon dioxide Brayton cycle from thermodynamic viewpoint, using a low-grade geothermal heat source, this paper presents a comparative thermodynamic analysis between four different supercritical carbon dioxide Brayton cycles. For this purpose, detailed models were developed and solved by coupling the thermodynamic model with the thermal-hydraulic model of a Printed Circuit Heat Exchanger. Subsequently, simulations of a base case, a parametric analysis, and an optimization using Genetic Algorithms, were carried out. Results show that there is a combination of operating conditions that maximizes the electrical output of the system. Besides, some values of the minimum pressure of the cycles can increase substantially the precooler cooling water pumping power. At the optimum design point, using a 20 kg/s geothermal brine stream at 150 °C as heat source with a minimum allowable reinjection temperature of 70 °C, the Intercooled Recuperated Brayton Cycle achieved the highest electric power output, energy and exergy efficiencies, obtaining values of 779.99 kW, 11.51%, and 52.49%, respectively. The other feasible alternatives were the Recuperated Brayton Cycle, the Simple Brayton Cycle and the Intercooled Brayton Cycle, ranked, in that order.","Elsevier","","National Renewable Energy Lab.

"Regional difference and related cooling electricity savings of air pollutant affected natural ventilation in commercial buildings across the US","Chen, Jianli; Augenbroe, Godfried; Zeng, Zhaoyun; Song, Xinyi","32 ENERGY CONSERVATION, CONSUMPTION, AND UTILIZATION; natural ventilation; air pollutant; cooling energy saving; economic analysis; regional difference","Maintaining indoor air pollutants under acceptable levels is significant to protect occupants from exposure to excessive air pollutants in natural ventilation. In this paper, using the representative air pollutant concentration data, we present the natural ventilation usability with associated cooling energy saving potentials in different location settings (urban and city center, suburban and rural) of the US under the influence of local weather conditions and major outdoor air pollutants, i.e. PM2.5, PM10 and ozone. It is found that the impacts of air pollutants on natural ventilation are usually higher in urban/suburban areas than rural areas (up to 25% difference) with the PM2.5 being the most significant outdoor air pollutant affecting natural ventilation usage. Furthermore, ozone could become increasingly influential on natural ventilation as moving from urban to suburban/rural areas. As to the cooling energy saving considering the impacts of outdoor air pollutants, natural ventilation is estimated to save approximately 10%–40% cooling energy (800–2600 kWh per small commercial building) annually in different location settings of investigated areas across the US. The following economic analysis demonstrates that these electricity savings lead to approximately 80–540 dollars annual savings of building operation cost per building. If the time of use rate is adopted, these cost savings could further increase by approximately 20% (Los Angeles) to more than 50% (Albuquerque) depending on different rate structures, which further demonstrates the potential of adopting natural ventilation as a sustainability measurement with benefits for building owners without compromising occupants health.","Elsevier","","National Renewable Energy Lab.

"An encoder–decoder LSTM-based EMPC framework applied to a building HVAC system","Ellis, Matthew J.; Chinde, Venkatesh","32 ENERGY CONSERVATION, CONSUMPTION, AND UTILIZATION; building; economic model predictive control; energy optimization; HVAC systems; long short term memory model","Numerous studies have demonstrated the benefit of economic model predictive control (EMPC) applied to building heating, ventilation, and air conditioning (HVAC) systems. However, the construction and training of predictive models for building HVAC systems are widely recognized as a key technological barrier preventing large-scale adoption of EMPC for buildings. In this work, an encoder–decoder long short-term memory-based EMPC framework is developed. The key advantage of the approach is that a model may be automatically generated from a list of inputs and outputs. From the definition of inputs and outputs, the constructed model may be trained and automatically embedded into the EMPC framework for real-time estimation and control. The overall end-to-end EMPC framework from model training to on-line estimation and control are described. To this end, the encoder–decoder model provides a natural framework for state estimation (encoder), which is required to provide an initial condition for the predictive model of EMPC (decoder). Closed-loop simulations using EnergyPlus are performed to demonstrate the approach. The simulated closed-loop system consists of a building zone from a multi-zone building, which is served by an air handling unit-variable air volume HVAC system. For the HVAC example considered, the trained encoder–decoder model can predict the indoor air temperature and HVAC sensible cooling rate of a building zone over a two-day horizon with high accuracy. Overall, we find that considering a time-of-use electric rate structure, the EMPC, which manipulates the zone temperature setpoint, can reduce the HVAC power consumption cost relative to keeping the zone temperature setpoint at its maximum value (i.e., minimum energy approach).","Elsevier","","National Renewable Energy Lab.

The as-atomized powders have pure BCC phase with a spherical shape and equal composition distribution, and then the FCC and sigma phase sequentially generated after annealing. The mechanical property such as hardness was evidently enhanced, which was caused by precipitation hardening effect. After the raw powders were annealed at 600 °C, the FCC (Al–Ni) phase began to precipitate, the its phase intensity raised with the annealing temperature. Then, the sigma phase (Fe– Cr)formed as the annealing temperature reached 800 °C. Both mechanical properties and lattice constant were influenced by heating effect. According to the results, the lattice became loose with the increasing temperature. In summary, the mechanical properties and phase constitutions of gasatomized AlCoCrFeNi HEA powders can be adjusted via annealing process, resulting in precipitation hardening effect.","IOP Publishing","","Louisiana State Univ., Baton Rouge, LA (United States)","USDOE Office of Science (SC); USDOE Office of Science (SC), Basic Energy Sciences (BES).

"Assessment of Commercial Building Lighting as a Frequency Regulation Resource","Karpilow, Alexandra; Henze, Gregor; Beamer, Walter","32 ENERGY CONSERVATION, CONSUMPTION, AND UTILIZATION; commercial buildings; lighting systems; ancillary services; frequency regulation","This paper evaluates the potential for automated lighting control as a resource for frequency regulation of the electric grid system in the context of current energy policies, economic incentives, and technological trends. The growing prevalence of renewable energy has increased the need for ancillary services to maintain grid frequency and stability. While demand side resources like heating, ventilating, and air-conditioning systems, as well as water treatment plants are already evaluated as regulation service providers, the potential application to electrical lighting systems has largely been ignored. Yet, aggregations of lighting systems that are retrofitted with intelligent controls could conceivably contribute to frequency regulation services with little impact on user comfort. To further explore the feasibility of lighting potential, this paper explores (1) how lighting control systems are limited by visual comfort perception and acceptability, (2) how such limitations impact the performance of the lighting system as an frequency regulation resource, and (3) how the market potential of lighting systems as demand side resources compares in different regional transmission organizations. Finally, the impact of developing technologies on the application of lighting systems for frequency regulation is discussed.","MDPI AG","","National Renewable Energy Lab.

Harvesting low-grade heat is challenging because of the low Carnot efficiency. Among various thermal energy harvesting mechanisms available for capturing low-grade heat (temperature less than 100 degrees C), the thermomagnetic effect has been found to be quite promising. In this study, we demonstrate a scalable thermomagnetic energy harvester architecture that exhibits 140% higher power density compared to the previously published spring-mass designs. The alternating force required to oscillate the thermomagnetic mass is generated through the interaction between two magnetic forces in opposite directions. We employed numerical modeling to illustrate the behavior of a thermomagnetic device under different operating conditions and to obtain the optimal hot-side and cold-side temperatures for continuous mode operations. A miniaturized thermomagnetic harvester was fabricated and experiments were conducted to systematically evaluate the performance. The prototype was found to exhibit an oscillation frequency of 0.33 Hz, a work output of 0.6 J/kg/cycle, and a power density of 0.2 W/kg of gadolinium under the temperature difference of 60 K.","American Institute of Physics (AIP)","","National Renewable Energy Lab.

Conditions comprised variations of Predicted Mean Vote (PMV), illuminance, sound pressure and CO<sub>2</sub> concentration (independent of a consistent ventilation rate) as indicators of thermal, lighting, acoustic and indoor air quality. Participant satisfaction with each of the four factors and with overall environmental conditions were measured with a questionnaire.

Results showed an adjusted effect of illuminance on perceived acoustic environment, a significant effect of the thermal environment on indoor air quality satisfaction, and a slight effect of sound pressure on indoor air quality satisfaction. Linear and geometric mean regression models were investigated for predicting overall satisfaction from the factor satisfaction scores. For the linear model, it was determined that multicollinearity among factor satisfaction levels may result in non-significant and biased estimated coefficients. The geometric mean regression model provides better prediction accuracy than the linear regression model with fewer coefficients, and accounts for the finding that the lowest satisfaction level with any environmental factor appears to drive overall satisfaction.","Elsevier","","Lawrence Berkeley National Lab.

Previous studies indicate strategies to manage PEV charging facilitate integration of RE into electricity grids, but the value of such strategies at scale is unclear because electricity markets and PEV charging have been inadequately represented together. This analysis focuses on the state of California in 2025, and improves on prior work by linking high-resolution mobility and grid dispatch models to quantify the value of managed charging under a 50% RE grid and PEV adoption scenarios up to California's 5 million vehicle target. Even after accounting for practical charging and grid constraints, 0.95 to 5 million “smart” charging PEVs avoid $120 to $690 million in California grid operating costs annually (up to 10% of total costs) and reduce RE curtailment up to 40% relative to unmanaged PEVs. Overnight time-of-use (TOU) charging provides similar cost savings but increases curtailment. Both of these managed strategies defer system infrastructure expansion at the 5 million PEV deployment. The results suggest residential smart charging complemented by TOU tariffs with added daytime periods are policies with most potential to advance California's dual PEV and RE goals.","Elsevier","","Lawrence Berkeley National Lab.

"Development of new baseline models for U.S. medium office buildings based on commercial buildings energy consumption survey data","Ye, Yunyang; Lou, Yingli; Strong, Matthew; Upadhyaya, Satish; Zuo, Wangda; Wang, Gang","32 ENERGY CONSERVATION, CONSUMPTION, AND UTILIZATION; climate models; energy policy; energy utilization; office buildings; surveys; uncertainty analysis","Building energy estimation for the building sector under various scenarios are needed for building energy regulation and policy making. This often starts with representative baselines (either empirical baseline or modeled baseline). Commercial Buildings Energy Consumption Survey (CBECS) data is a widely used empirical baseline for U.S. commercial buildings, but none of the existing baseline model are developed to represent the CBECS data. This paper aims to develop new baseline models for the U.S. medium office buildings, which can produce modeled baselines consistent with the CBECS data. Here, we introduced the methodology to create baseline models and the criteria to evaluate the performance of baseline models. The methodology consists of three phases: (1) identification of model inputs, (2) model calibration, and (3) model validation with uncertainty analysis. The evaluation index is the coefficient of variation of the root-mean-square deviation (CV(RMSD)) of site energy use intensities (EUIs) between the modeled baseline and empirical baseline. Then 30 new baseline models for two vintages (pre- and post-1980) and 15 climate zones were created. The evaluation shows that the CV(RMSD) is lower than 0.05 for the modeled baselines produced by the new baseline models. As a comparison, the CV(RMSD) is higher than 0.1 for the existing modeled baselines generated by DOE Commercial Reference Building Models. Further analysis shows that the new baseline models are able to capture the uncertainties of the representative features of existing buildings.","Taylor & Francis","","National Renewable Energy Lab.

"Learning-based load control to support resilient networked microgrid operations","Radhakrishnan, Nikitha; Schneider, Kevin P.; Tuffner, Francis K.; Du, Wei; Bhattarai, Bishnu P.","32 ENERGY CONSERVATION, CONSUMPTION, AND UTILIZATION","Networked and interconnected microgrids can improve resilience of critical end-use loads during extreme events. However, the frequency deviations in microgrids during transient events are significantly larger than those typically seen in bulk transmission systems. The larger frequency deviations can cause a loss of inverter-connected assets, resulting in a loss of power to critical end-use loads. Grid Friendly Appliance <sup>TM</sup> (GFA) controllers can mitigate the transient event effects by engaging end-use loads. This paper presents a method to select set-points for end-use loads equipped with GFA controllers, while minimizing the interruptions to end-use customers. An online (i.e. real-time), device-level algorithm adjusts individual GFA controller frequency setpoints based on the operational characteristics of each end-use load and on the changing grid dynamic characteristics to selectively engage the load for mitigating the switching transients. The adaptive gradient-descent-based algorithm does not require control or coordination amongst end-use devices for adapting frequency set-points. The method is validated using dynamic simulations on a modified version of the IEEE 123-node test system with three microgrids using the GridLAB-D <sup>TM</sup> simulation environment. The improved dynamic stability achieved through the engagement of GFAs support the switching operations necessary for networked microgrid operations.","The Institution of Engineering and Technology","","Pacific Northwest National Lab.

In developing a transportation system deployment model, the energy impact of the model is extremely valuable for sustainability and validation. It is expected that different penetration levels of Connected-Autonomous Vehicles (CAVs) will impact travel behavior due to changes in potential factors such as congestion, miles traveled, etc. Along with such impact analyses, it is also important to further quantify the regional energy impact of CAV deployment under different factors of interest. The objective of this paper is to study the energy consumption of electrified vehicles in the future for different penetration levels of CAVs deployment in the City of Chicago. The paper will further provide a statistical analysis of the results to evaluate the impact of the different penetration levels on the different electrified powertrains used in the study.","MDPI","","Argonne National Lab.

Our analysis relies on detailed bottom-up modeling of current state energy efficiency policies, demand-side management and integrated resource plans, and regulatory decisions. The three scenarios represent a range of potential outcomes given the policy environment at the time of the study and uncertainties in the broader economic and state policy environment in each state. We project spending to increase to $8.6 billion in 2030 in the medium scenario, about a 45 percent increase relative to 2016 spending. In the high case, annual spending increases to $11.1 billion in 2030 and remains relatively flat in the low case ($6.8 billion in 2030). Our analysis suggests that electricity efficiency programs funded by utility customers will continue to impact load growth significantly at least through 2030, as savings as a percent of retail sales are forecast at 0.7 percent in the medium scenario and 0.98 percent in the high scenario.","Elsevier","","Lawrence Berkeley National Lab.

The proposed methodology was successfully applied to the calculation of uncertainties associated with residential energy retrofits using two test houses designed for pre- and post-retrofit cases. Uncertainties were determined using basic parameters that might be supplied to an energy model and then reevaluated based on an audit of the KIPs identified, resulting in substantially reduced uncertainty. Of four different scenarios, the most uncertain scenario estimated the annual energy savings from the retrofit would be between 18% and 51% at a 95% confidence level, and the least uncertain scenario estimated the annual savings would be between 26% and 40% at a 95% confidence level. The actual measured annual savings from the two test houses was 28%, which shows an agreement with the uncertainty analysis.","Elsevier","","National Renewable Energy Lab.

"Energy Transitions Towards Low Carbon Resilience: Evaluation of Disaster-Triggered Local and Regional Cases","Ko, Yekang; Barrett, Brendan F.

The consequence of continued emission growth tied to rising global average temperatures is difficult to predict, but against a background of other natural and human-induced disasters, may create a situation, from a positive perspective, where each disaster event triggers “build back better” responses designed to speed the transition toward low carbon, resilience-oriented energy systems. This article examines the potential for disaster-triggered responses in communities, at various local and regional levels, in four industrial economies in the Asia Pacific region: Japan, China, Australia, and the USA. Seven case studies were evaluated against a set of criteria that exemplify the key aspects of resilient energy systems. The research results suggest that a new space of innovation does emerge in post-disaster situations at a range of local and regional scales. The greatest potential benefit and opportunity for significant gains, however, appears to manifest at the small community level, and the ultimate challenge relates to how to mainstream local innovations into state and national level transformation on energy systems so as to enhance resilience and promote rapid decarbonization.","MDPI","","Pacific Northwest National Lab.

Yet, available occupant field data are insufficient to explore the mechanisms that drive this interaction. This paper introduces data from a one year study of 24 U.S. office occupants that recorded a comprehensive set of possible exogenous and endogenous drivers of personal comfort and behavior over time. The longitudinal data collection protocol merges individual thermal comfort, preference, and behavior information from online daily surveys with datalogger readings of occupants’ local thermal environments and control states, yielding 2503 survey responses alongside tens of thousands of concurrent behavior and environment measurements. These data have been used to uncover links between the built environment, personal variables, and adaptive actions, and the data contribute to international research collaborations focused on understanding the human-building interaction.","Nature Publishing Group","","Lawrence Berkeley National Lab.

"Two trillion gallons: Fuel savings from fuel economy improvements to US light-duty vehicles, 1975–2018","Greene, David L.; Sims, Charles B.; Muratori, Matteo","32 ENERGY CONSERVATION, CONSUMPTION, AND UTILIZATION; CAFE standards; energy efficiency; fuel economy; ghg regulations; light-duty vehicles; rebound effect","Since 1975, the fuel economy of new light-duty vehicles sold in the U.S. has almost doubled. Fuel economy improvements on laboratory tests gradually became real improvements on the road as newer, more efficient vehicles replaced older less efficient ones. Fleet-wide fuel economy gains produced large fuel savings. In this paper, we show that fuel economy gains measured on laboratory test cycles, adjusted for on-road conditions and weighted by the distribution of vehicles by age and their relative use, closely match estimates by the Federal Highway Administration based primarily on traffic counts and motor fuel tax records. Furthermore, adjusting for the rebound effect of fuel economy on vehicle miles traveled, we estimate the fuel savings, CO<sub>2</sub> emissions reductions and dollars saved on fuel due to fuel economy improvements over the past 43 years. Through the end of 2018, estimated cumulative fuel savings amount to approximately 2 trillion gallons of gasoline. We estimate that roughly one-fifth of the savings can be attributed to gasoline price increases over the period and four-fifths to fuel economy and greenhouse gas (ghg) standards.","Elsevier","","National Renewable Energy Lab.

We evaluated the angular distribution of solar radiation incident on exterior walls in 17 U S. climates to develop performance parameters for solar-retroreflective walls, then applied first-principle physics and ray-tracing simulations to explore designs. Our analysis indicates that retroreflective walls must function at large incidence angles to reflect a substantial portion of summer sunlight, and that this will be difficult to attain with materials that rely on total internal reflection. Gonio-spectrophotometer measurements of the solar spectral bi-directional reflectivity of a bicycle reflector showed little to no retroreflection at large incidence angles. Visual comparisons of retroreflection to specular first-surface reflection for four different retroreflective safety films using violet and green lasers suggest their retroreflection to be no greater than 0.09 at incidence angles up to 45°, and no greater than 0.30 at incidence angles of up to 70°. Attempts to produce a two-surface retroreflector with orthogonal mirror grooves by cutting and polishing an aluminum block indicate that residual surface roughness impedes retroreflection. Ongoing efforts focus on forming orthogonal surfaces with aluminized Mylar film, a material with very high specular reflectance across the solar spectrum. We investigated (1) folding or stamping a free film; (2) adhering the film to a pre-shaped substrate; or (3) attaching the film to a flat ductile substrate, then shaping.

Twenty-seven FDD users reported that the median base cost for FDD software, annual recurring software cost, and annual labor cost were $8, $2.7 and $8 per monitoring point, with a median implementation size of approximately 1300 points. To address the second question, this paper describes a systematic methodology for evaluating the performance of FDD algorithms, curates an initial test dataset of air handling unit (AHU) system faults, and completes a trial to demonstrate the evaluation process on three sample FDD algorithms. The work provided a first step toward a standard evaluation of different FDD technologies. Finally, it showed the test methodology is indeed scalable and repeatable, provided an understanding of the types of insights that can be gained from algorithm performance testing, and highlighted the priorities for further expanding the test dataset.","Elsevier","","Lawrence Berkeley National Lab.

The resulting PVSCs show the best average power conversion efficiency (PCE) of over 18.47% from forward and reverse scans. Mini-modules with an active area of over 2.7 cm<sup>2</sup> exhibit a champion average PCE of over 17.73% without apparent hysteresis. To the best of our knowledge, these efficiencies are the highest for PVSCs processed by the combination of blade coating and RTP. Furthermore, both the blade coating and RTP were performed in an ambient environment, paving the way for the large-scale production of PVSCs through high-speed roll-to-roll printing.","American Chemical Society (ACS)","","National Renewable Energy Lab.

This study combines an experiment in the summer and transition seasons with an annual simulation so as to evaluate the thermal performance, energy savings and thermal comfort improvement that could be obtained by coupling a cool roof with night ventilation. A holistic approach integrating sensitivity analysis and multi-objective optimization is developed to explore key design parameters (roof albedo, night ventilation air change rate, roof insulation level and internal thermal mass level) and optimal design options for the combined application of the cool roof and night ventilation. The proposed approach is validated and demonstrated through studies on a six-storey office building in Xiamen, a cooling-dominated city in southeast China. Simulations show that combining a cool roof with night ventilation can significantly decrease the annual cooling energy consumption by 27% compared to using a black roof without night ventilation and by 13% compared to using a cool roof without night ventilation. Roof albedo is the most influential parameter for both building energy performance and indoor thermal comfort. Optimal use of the cool roof and night ventilation can reduce the annual cooling energy use by 28% during occupied hours when air-conditioners are on and reduce the uncomfortable time slightly during occupied hours when air-conditioners are off.","Elsevier","","Lawrence Berkeley National Lab.

As for now, we are in a stage of blossoming sciences and technologies related to carbon materials, as a result of which our ever-growing energy demand has been largely satisfied. Yet, the expected rise of carbon energy consumption and the emerging environmental concerns have prevented us from being optimistic. To build a sufficiently powered future, we have been revolutionizing our ways of carbon energy utilization by discovering and designing new carbon structures, exploring and enhancing their unique physicochemical properties, and pursuing environmentally friendly strategies. Emerging structures such as graphene and sp-bonded C<sub>18</sub> have allowed us to discover carbon’s promising properties such as energy storage and superconductivity, while green energy solutions such as fuel cells and CO<sub>2</sub> reduction are working synergistically to purify the ecospheric carbon cycle.

The current dual-fan dual-duct (DFDD) system is 41 years old and has a higher energy utilization index (EUI) than the national average for similar building types. The baseline model with the DFDD system was compared with the actual electrical consumption. Then, two energy efficiency measures (EEMs) were applied to the model. The first EEM was ‘DFDD system with chilled water and steam heating,’ and the second EEM was ‘single-duct variable air volume (VAV) with chilled water and electric reheat.’ After comparative simulations and analyses, it was determined that the ‘single duct VAV with chilled water and electric reheat’ was the most energy efficient and saved 28% in utility costs. The recommendation given to the facility services was to change the current DFDD system to the single-duct VAV system. The single-duct VAV system will save energy and create additional space above the ceiling after the heating duct is removed.","MDPI","","Indiana Univ., Indianapolis, IN (United States)","USDOE Office of Energy Efficiency and Renewable Energy (EERE), Energy Efficiency Office.

Skin temperature changes were induced with a thermal probe 14 mm in diameter, and subjective thermal sensations were surveyed after 10 s. Our neutral base temperature was 31 °C and the spot stimulus was ±5 °C. Cool and warm sensitivities are seen to vary widely by body part. The foot, lower leg and upper chest are much less sensitive than average; in comparison, the cheek, neck back, and seat area are 2–3 times as sensitive to both cooling and warming stimuli. Every body part exhibits stronger sensitivity to cooling (1.3–1.6 times stronger) than to warming. Inter-personal differences and regional variance within body parts were observed to be 2–3 times greater than potential sex differences.

"Cloud-based implementation of white-box model predictive control for a GEOTABS office building: A field test demonstration","Drgoňa, Ján; Picard, Damien; Helsen, Lieve","32 ENERGY CONSERVATION, CONSUMPTION, AND UTILIZATION; Model predictive control; building climate control; white-box modeling; cloud-based implementation; field test","Model predictive control (MPC) has been proven in simulations and pilot case studies to be a superior control strategy for large buildings. MPC can utilize the weather and occupancy schedule forecasts, together with the system model, to predict the future thermal behavior of the building and minimize the overall energy use and maximize thermal comfort. However, these advantages come with the cost of increased modeling effort, computational demands, communication infrastructure, and commissioning efforts. Thus a typical approach is to, often rapidly, simplify the building modeling and MPC optimization problem while paying a price of not reaching the full performance potential. It has been shown that by employing accurate physics-based models, MPC performance can be notably increased closer to its theoretical performance bound. However, implementation of such high-fidelity MPC in real buildings remains a challenge, resulting in a lack of successful field test studies. This work presents the methodology and field test demonstration of a computationally efficient implementation of the white-box MPC in an office building in Belgium. The detailed model of the building is based on first-principle physical equations. The deployment and supervision of MPC operation in a practical setting are supported by an automated cloud-based communication infrastructure. The motivating factor behind the cloud-based architecture is its compatibility with a commercially appealing control as a service concept. The building is equipped with a ground source heat pump (GSHP) and thermally activated building structures (TABS), where the combination of both is also known as GEOTABS. From a control perspective, GEOTABS buildings are particularly challenging systems due to large scale, complex heating, ventilation and air conditioning (HVAC) system, and slow dynamics with time delays. On the other hand, there is an increased potential for energy savings due to the high thermal mass, which acts as thermal storage. The MPC operation is demonstrated during the challenging transient seasons (switching between heating and cooling), and its performance is compared to a traditional rule-based controller (RBC). We provide a proof of concept of real MPC operation for the most difficult seasons with notable GSHP energy use savings equal to 53.5% and thermal comfort improvement by 36.9%. Other MPC applications found in the literature describe tests for only cooling or only heating, and up to now only for a black-box or a grey-box approach.","Elsevier","","Pacific Northwest National Lab.

Here, a TAC consisting of alternate layers of rigid foam insulation and thin, high-conductivity aluminum foil was investigated. The TAC was coupled with copper tubes with circulating water that acted as a heat sink and source. The TAC system was applied to a conventional wood-framed wall assembly, and the energy benefits were investigated experimentally and numerically. For experimental testing, large scale test wall specimens were built with and without the TAC system and tested in an environmental chamber under simulated diurnal hot and cold weather conditions. Component-level and whole building numerical simulations were performed to investigate the energy benefits of applying the TAC system to the external walls of a typical, single-family residential building.","MDPI AG","","Oak Ridge National Lab.

Managing ever-changing plug loads is a great challenge given the quantity and variety of devices in commercial buildings and the cost of monitoring equipment. To address this issue, we propose a method for developing a disaggregated model of an office building's plug loads that utilizes power data from a small portion of monitored devices and a device inventory. Using data from metering and control devices in the Research Support Facility at the National Renewable Energy Laboratory, we compared our model to the building's plug load submeters. We found that the model was effective in predicting the shape of the building's average plug loads; however, it did not account for the entire magnitude of the load. With the disaggregated breakdown, we identified devices that contributed significantly to the building's unoccupied load, such as the audio visual equipment as well as devices that contributed significantly at specific times of the day, such as the microwaves at noon. This disaggregated information enables building owners to make more informed decisions with respect to plug load controls and energy efficiency upgrades. Furthermore, we highlight how the plug loads in the Research Support Facility have changed over time and offer recommendations for implementing this disaggregation method in other buildings.","Elsevier","","National Renewable Energy Lab.

The second roof is covered with an aluminum plate separated by a 0.10 m air gap above a 0.25 m deep water pond. We ran multiple series and compared the results to a control cell that had a California energy code compliant insulated roof. Predictive equations are developed to dimension the WAHE system. Results demonstrate that the cells with roof ponds have better cooling performance than the code compliant control cell.

The FR model incorporates the key components of the Rakha-Pasumarthy-Adjerid (RPA) model in that it uses the same steady state formulation, respects vehicle dynamics, and uses very similar collision-avoidance strategies to ensure safe following distances between vehicles. The main contributions of the FR model over the RPA model are the following: (1) it models the driver throttle and brake pedal input; (2) it captures driver variability; (3) it allows for shorter than steady-state following distances when following faster leading vehicles; (4) it offers a much smoother acceleration profile while converging to steady states; and (5) it explicitly captures driver perception and control inaccuracies and errors. Besides describing the methodology and the role of each of the model parameters, this study evaluates the performance of the new model using a naturalistic driving dataset. A brief comparative analysis was performed to validate the model with regard to replicating empirical driver and vehicle behavior. Through a quantitative and qualitative evaluation, the proposed FR model reflects a significant decrease in the modeling error when compared to the original RPA model and generates trajectories that are highly consistent with empirically observed car-following behavior.","Elsevier","","Virginia Polytechnic Inst. and State Univ.

Thus, a novel data-driven algorithm based on local outlier factor (LOF) is proposed in this work to detect and locate events in power systems using reduced PMU data. First, the unequal-interval reduction method is presented to reduce the scale of PMU data in sub-stations and reconstruct it in master station of WAMS, which can relieve the burden of communication systems. Then, principle component analysis (PCA)-based similarity search method is proposed to measure the differences of operation state between any two buses. Next, LOF is presented to detect the abnormal events in power systems, and employed to determine the region of the event source. Finally, six cases from the Western electricity coordinating council (WECC) 179-bus power system, a case from the South China power system (SCPS), and a case from the Guangdong power system (GDPS) are utilized to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed algorithm. Overall, the results show that proposed algorithm is effective and can be applied to event detection, event location, and online monitoring, which can enhance the situation awareness ability of power system operators.","IEEE","","Oak Ridge National Lab.

"Nonlinear dynamic analysis of solution multiplicity of buoyancy ventilation in a typical underground structure","Liu, Yanan; Xiao, Yimin; Chen, Jianli","32 ENERGY CONSERVATION, CONSUMPTION, AND UTILIZATION; buoyancy ventilation; multiple steady states; nonlinear dynamics; underground buildings","Buoyancy ventilation is widely used in underground buildings, such as underground hydropower stations. Multiple solutions of buoyancy ventilation may exist in those underground structures. In this study, we developed a transient model comprising an ordinary differential equation system to describe buoyancy ventilation patterns in typical two-zone underground structures. Additionally, the accuracy of the model was validated. Nonlinear dynamical analysis was conducted to study multiple steady-state airflow. According to mathematical derivation, the configuration of one local heat source at the bottom corner introduces two stable solutions. The criterion to determine the stability and existence of solutions for more general scenarios was developed. Using this criterion, we obtained the multiple steady states of any two-zone underground buildings for different stack height ratios and the strength ratios of the heat sources. Furthermore, this criterion can be adopted for the design of buoyancy ventilation or natural smoke ventilation systems. Designers can change the height ratio of the stack or the heat ratio of two zones to induce the desired ventilation patterns. Finally, a case study was conducted with field measurements to demonstrate the use of the nonlinear dynamical analysis method to investigate the multiple steady states of buoyancy ventilation. Through the case study, we validated that the proposed criterion could produce the same result as the nonlinear dynamical analysis.","Elsevier","","National Renewable Energy Lab.

"Roof-integrated radiative air-cooling system to achieve cooler attic for building energy saving","Zhao, Dongliang; Aili, Ablimit; Yin, Xiaobo; Tan, Gang; Yang, Ronggui","32 ENERGY CONSERVATION, CONSUMPTION, AND UTILIZATION; radiative sky cooling; attic cooling; attic ventilation; building energy saving","The building attic usually subjects to substantial solar heat gain and has much higher temperature compared to the conditioned living space during the day, especially in summer and in hot areas. Reducing attic temperature can reduce cooling energy consumption in buildings. However, conventional techniques such as cool roof or attic ventilation, suffer from either heating penalty in winter or limited attic temperature reduction. In this work, a new roof-integrated radiative air-cooling system is introduced, which couples radiative sky cooling with attic ventilation to reduce attic temperature. A radiative air cooler with 1.08 m<sup>2</sup> surface area is constructed using a recently developed daytime radiative sky cooling metamaterial [Zhai et al., Science 355, pp. 1062–1066, 2017]. Experimental tests show that sub-ambient air cooling is achieved throughout 24-h day-and-night cycle in a summer day with clear sky conditions. Depending on air flow rates, measured sub-ambient temperature reductions of air are 5–8°C at night and 3–5°C at noon under direct sunlight, respectively. An in-house model is first developed for the radiative air-cooling system, the model is then coupled with EnergyPlus to study annual energy saving of buildings. The performance of the radiative air-cooling system is compared with three reference systems: shingle roof, attic ventilation, and cool roof. Results show that for a single-family house, attic temperature can be substantially reduced by 15.5–21.0°C, varying with attic insulation level, compared to shingle roof on typical summer days. Compared to a shingle roof (solar reflectance 0.25, thermal emittance 0.9) residential building with attic insulations of R-30 (RSI-5.28), R-10 (RSI-1.76), and R-0.8 (RSI-0.14), the roof-integrated radiative air-cooling system can achieve annual cooling energy savings of 0.4–1.5 kWh/m<sup>2</sup> (4.6–18.8%), 1.2–3.6 kWh/m<sup>2</sup> (10.2–41.4%), and 3.7–11.8 kWh/m<sup>2</sup> (26.5–76.1%) respectively.","Elsevier","","Univ. of Colorado, Boulder, CO (United States)","USDOE Advanced Research Projects Agency - Energy (ARPA-E)","","United States","2019-09-23T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: Energy and Buildings; Journal Volume: 203","","Medium: ED; Size: Article No. 109453","","","AR0000580","Journal ID: ISSN 0378-7788; PII: S0378778819312083","10.1016/j.enbuild.2019.109453","","2022-05-04T00:00:00Z","1799028","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/1799028","https://www.osti.gov/servlets/purl/1799028","Energy and Buildings","","203"

"The good, the bad, and the ugly: Data-driven load profile discord identification in a large building portfolio","Park, June Young; Wilson, Eric; Parker, Andrew; Nagy, Zoltan","32 ENERGY CONSERVATION, CONSUMPTION, AND UTILIZATION; buildings; data mining; discord detection; load profile; portfolio analysis; smart meter","Reducing the overall energy consumption and associated greenhouse gas emissions in the building sector is essential for meeting our future sustainability goals. Recently, smart energy metering facilities have been deployed to enable monitoring of energy consumption data with hourly or subhourly temporal resolution. This unprecedented data collection has created various opportunities for advanced data analytics involving load profiles (e.g., building energy benchmarking programs, building-to-grid integration, and calibration of urban-scale energy models). These applications often need preprocessing steps to detect daily load profile discords, such as: 1) outliers due to system malfunctions (the bad) and 2) irregular energy consumption patterns, such as those resulting from holidays (the ugly) compared to normal consumption patterns (the good). However, current preprocessing methods predominantly focus on filtering using statistical threshold values, which fail to capture the contextual discords of daily profiles. In addition, discord detection algorithms in building research are often aimed at finding individual building-level discords, which are not suitable at a large scale. Thus, here, we develop a method for automated load profile discord identification (ALDI) in a large portfolio of buildings (more than 100 buildings). Specifically, ALDI 1) uses the matrix profile (MP) method to quantify the similarities of daily subsequences in time series meter data, 2) compares daily MP values with typical-day MP distributions using the Kolmogorov-Smirnov test, and 3) identifies daily load profile discords in a large building portfolio. We evaluate ALDI using the metering data of both an academic campus and a residential neighborhood. Our results demonstrate that ALDI efficiently discovers measurement errors by system malfunctions and low energy consumption days in the academic campus portfolio, and it detects unique load shape patterns likely driven by occupant behavior and extreme weather conditions in the residential neighborhood.","Elsevier","","National Renewable Energy Lab.

"An Innovative Fault Impact Analysis Framework for Enhancing Building Operations","Li, Yanfei; O'Neill, Zheng","32 ENERGY CONSERVATION, CONSUMPTION, AND UTILIZATION; fault simulation; fault impact analysis; EnergyPlus; parametric sensitivity analysis","The main goal of this paper is to rank building faults based on their impacts on the building energy penalty and occupant thermal comfort penalty considering multiple faults and fault occurrence rates. A fault impact analysis framework is created by incorporating the fault model library with the whole building energy performance simulation (e.g., EnergyPlus used in this study). The fault occurrence rate is introduced as a 'meta' parameter in the simulation. This framework involves three essential aspects of conducting a fault impact analysis: fault constructing, fault simulation, and fault impact analysis. A parametric sensitivity analysis was used to determine and rank the criticality of the faults considering the fault concurrence frequency, by using the deep-learning based response surface model (i.e., the multi-layer perceptron regression). The proposed fault analysis framework with ranking was tested and demonstrated for the DOE's prototype medium-sized office in four different climate zones (i.e., Atlanta, Chicago, Miami, and San Francisco) with 12,000 EnergyPlus fault simulations. A total of 129 fault modes from 41 groups of fault models were simulated for the medium-sized office case. The results demonstrate the proposed framework is robust and scalable for the fault impact analysis. The top critical fault for the medium-sized office is the fault of HVAC-Left-ON for the packaged rooftop unit, regarding the site energy, source energy, and HVAC energy. Excluding the fault of HVAC-Left-ON, the top critical faults vary significantly among the four climate zones.","Elsevier","","National Renewable Energy Lab.

To be useful, consensus algorithms must be computationally efficient, stable and accurate. In practice, numerous practical implementation challenges significantly affect the consensus equilibrium. In this paper, we quantify the accuracy deviations of the distributed average observer algorithms proposed in the literature to demonstrate the problems with the state-of-the-art distributed averaging techniques. A novel approach is proposed that achieves accurate average tracking in the presence of time-varying communication delays among agents.

"Development of a topology analysis tool for fifth-generation district heating and cooling networks","von Rhein, Justus; Henze, Gregor P.; Long, Nicholas; Fu, Yangyang","32 ENERGY CONSERVATION, CONSUMPTION, AND UTILIZATION; fifth-generation district heating and cooling systems; topology analysis; hydraulic network modeling","Fifth generation district heating and cooling networks are characterized by supply temperatures in the ambient range of 15-25 degrees C, which not only reduces heat loss but also allows for integrating various kinds of low-temperature waste heat sources. The ability of these networks to absorb waste heat that is normally unrecoverable makes them an attractive solution for the future energy supply of urban areas. To enhance the adoption of these networks, this paper describes the development of a software tool to analyze the feasibility of fifth-generation of district heating and cooling systems in both new and existing districts. The research attempts to answer the question: 'Which buildings should be connected to a low-temperature hydraulic network given both the incremental benefits and costs relative to the scenario of decentralized (dedicated) heating and cooling systems for each building?' Therefore, all possible network layouts of the buildings are considered where the heating and cooling demands of each building are met by the fifth-generation of district heating and cooling network. For the heating and cooling load characterization of the buildings, reduced-order models are used while renewable energy and waste heat sources are included in the network. The focus of the research lies in the development of a hydraulic model for flexible use in the urban energy modeling and the optimization of the fifth-generation of district heating and cooling network topology for a given urban district. This research displays simulation results that quantify the performance of the fifth-generation of district heating and cooling network based on various output metrics, including primary energy usage, carbon dioxide emissions, and network implementation cost.","Elsevier","","National Renewable Energy Lab.

Existing studies show that sensor errors hold a place among top-priority faults in building systems. Before we take countermeasures to mitigate the sensor errors, it is vital to prioritize key sensors and quantify the collective impacts of concurrent sensor errors. In response to this, a simulation-based methodology is introduced to conduct a comprehensive sensor error impact analysis in building systems, which adds a stochastic sensor prioritization through a sensitivity analysis on top of a commonly used deterministic sensor error quantification. The synergies of these two parts help better interpret the sensor error impacts on building energy consumption, ventilation performance, thermal comfort, etc. A sensor-rich CO2-based Demand-Controlled Ventilation system is used as a case study to demonstrate the viability of the methodology as a proof-of-the-concept. The results show that the energy savings potential and ventilation performance are mostly influenced by the accuracy of the AHU outdoor airflow sensors. The accuracy of zone level airflow sensors has a negligible impact on both energy savings and ventilation performance. The accuracy of zone CO2 sensors has more influence on the ventilation performance compared with the accuracy of zone airflow sensors. Compared with the baseline case with zero errors, the largest deviation percentages could reach 16.90% and 94.32%, respectively, in terms of the Heating, Ventilation, and Air-Conditioning (HVAC) annual energy consumption and the Outdoor Air Ratio (OAR) when multiple key sensors suffer from normal error intensities simultaneously.","","","National Renewable Energy Lab.

In this work we present a system-level integration of a nanosecond-scale $2 \times 2$ silicon photonic switch with a 25-Gbps burst-mode receiver that can lock in 31 ns. A novel FPGA-based control plane was used to generate test data, control the silicon photonic switch and burst-mode receiver, and measure bit errors at 12.5 and 20 Gbps.

In the future, utilities and consumers may monetarily and environmentally benefit from continuously shaping load by alternatively encouraging or discouraging the use of electricity. One way to shape load and introduce elasticity is to broadcast forecasts of dynamic electricity prices that orchestrate electricity supply and demand in order to maximize the efficiency of conventional generation and the use of renewable resources including wind and solar energy. A binary control algorithm that influences the on and off states of end uses was developed and applied to empirical time series data to estimate price-based instantaneous opportunities for shedding and adding electric load. To overcome the limitations of traditional stochastic methods in quantifying diverse, non-Gaussian, non-stationary distributions of observed appliance behaviour, recent developments in wavelet-based analysis were applied to capture and simulate time-frequency domain behaviour. The performance of autoregressive and spectral reconstruction methods was compared, with phase reconstruction providing the best simulation ensembles. Results show spatiotemporal differences in the amount of load that can be shed and added, which suggest further investigation is warranted in estimating the benefits anticipated from the wide-scale deployment of continuous automatic residential load shaping.

"Thermo-economic analysis of a novel hybrid multigeneration system based on an integrated triple effect refrigeration system for production of power and refrigeration","Mohammadi, Kasra; Saghafifar, Mohammad; McGowan, Jon G.; Powell, Kody","32 ENERGY CONSERVATION, CONSUMPTION, AND UTILIZATION; Multigeneration; Integrated system; Brayton cycle; Triple-evaporator refrigeration; Waste energy recovery; Thermo-economic evaluation","Multigeneration systems provide substantial benefits in terms of improving efficiency and economics as well as environmental benefits. In this study, a multigeneration system is proposed for generating power and triple effect refrigeration at different evaporation temperatures. The system hybridizes a 25 MW recuperative Brayton cycle with an organic Rankine cycle (ORC) and an integrated refrigeration system that combines a branched generator–absorber heat exchange (GAX) absorption refrigeration system with a dual-evaporator cascade carbon dioxide-ammonia compression refrigeration system. The exhaust gas from the Brayton cycle is divided into two streams: one is supplied to the generator of the GAX cycle and the remaining is supplied to the ORC for additional power generation. Results show that additional power generation by ORC increases thermal efficiency from 0.394 to 0.510 and reduces the levelized cost of electricity from $\$75.5$/MWh to $\$64.4$/MWh. The integration of GAX cycle and cascade cycle is beneficial from both thermodynamic and economic viewpoints. Due to their integration, the coefficient of performance of the cascade cycle increases substantially from 2.37 to 4.69. Also, the levelized cost of cooling for the production of triple effect refrigeration decreases from $\$0.08$/ton-hr to $\$0.059$/ton-hr. Environmental analysis shows that the development of multigeneration system can lead to avoiding 24,185 tons of CO<sub>2</sub> per year. The proposed multigeneration system brings a possibility to efficiently recover the waste energy for additional power generation and refrigeration production at different temperatures. Waste energy recovery by the ORC and GAX cycle as well as the integration of the GAX cycle with a cascade refrigeration cycle provide good potential for cleaner production of all products with improved efficiency, economics and environmental benefit.","Elsevier","","Univ. of Utah, Salt Lake City, UT (United States)","USDOE Office of Energy Efficiency and Renewable Energy (EERE)","","United States","2019-08-03T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: Journal of Cleaner Production; Journal Volume: 238","","Medium: ED; Size: Article No. 117912","","","EE0007712","Journal ID: ISSN 0959-6526","10.1016/j.jclepro.2019.117912","","2022-06-28T00:00:00Z","1864032","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/1864032","https://www.osti.gov/servlets/purl/1864032","Journal of Cleaner Production","","238"

To increase confidence in compound identifications, the use of structural fragmentation data collected via tandem mass spectrometry (MS/MS or MS2) is vital. However, the availability of empirically collected MS/MS data for identification of unknowns is limited. Researchers have therefore turned to in silico generation of MS/MS data for use in HRMS-based screening studies. This paper describes the generation en masse of predicted MS/MS spectra for the entirety of the US EPA’s DSSTox database using competitive fragmentation modelling and a freely available open source tool, CFM-ID. The generated dataset comprises predicted MS/MS spectra for ~700,000 structures, and mappings between predicted spectra, structures, associated substances, and chemical metadata. Together, these resources facilitate improved compound identifications in HRMS screening studies.

The flexibility of thermal and electric load in buildings is a result of their interactive nature and its impact on the building’s performance. In this paper, the interaction of a building with the three interaction counterparts of the physical environment, civil infrastructure networks and other buildings is investigated. The literature review presents a wide variety of pathways of interaction and their associated potential impacts on building performance metrics such as net energy use, emissions, occupant comfort and operational cost. It is demonstrated that all of these counterparts of interaction should be considered to harness the flexibility potential of the buildings while maintaining other buildings performance metrics at a desired level. Juxtaposed with the upside potential for providing demand flexibility, numerous implementation challenges are identified that are associated with the evaluation and financial valuation of the capacity for demand flexibility, the aggregated flexibility potential, as well as the control and communication to facilitate the interactions.</p>","MDPI","","National Renewable Energy Lab.

To advance understanding of contributing factors, this study visited 104 classrooms from 11 schools that had recently been retrofitted with new heating, ventilation, and air-conditioning (HVAC) units. CO<sub>2</sub> concentration, room and supply air temperature and relative humidity, and door opening were measured for four weeks in each classroom. Field inspections identified HVAC equipment, fan control, and/or filter maintenance problems in 51% of the studied classrooms. Across 94 classrooms with valid data, average CO<sub>2</sub> concentrations measured during school hours had a mean of 895 ppm and a standard deviation (SD) of 263 ppm. Ventilation rates (VRs), estimated using the daily maximum 15-min CO<sub>2</sub> in each classroom, had a mean of 5.2 L/s-person and a SD of 2.0 L/s-person across 94 classrooms. Classrooms with economizers, with or without demand control ventilation (DCV), tended to have lower mean CO<sub>2</sub>. Improperly selected equipment, lack of commissioning, incorrect fan control settings and maintenance issues (heavily loaded filters) were all associated with under-ventilation in classrooms. Many classrooms in this sample were frequently too warm to support learning. There were 23 out of 103 classrooms that had indoor air temperature above 25.6 °C for more than 20% of the school hours. Better oversight on HVAC system installation and commissioning are needed to ensure adequate classroom ventilation. Periodic testing of ventilation systems and/or continuous real-time CO<sub>2</sub> monitoring (either as stand-alone monitors or incorporated into thermostats) is recommended to detect and correct ventilation problems.","Elsevier","","Lawrence Berkeley National Lab.

Creating an efficient mobility system is difficult, given that each driver is usually trying to optimize their individual trip within the network without accounting for other road users. However, new technologies in modern vehicles, especially connected vehicle technologies, make it increasingly possible to find solutions to network efficiency problems. Connected technologies allow data sharing between vehicles, allowing for greater system optimization. This work takes advantage of connectivity to develop a global framework to increase transportation network efficiency and address the aforementioned challenges. To enhance mobility, this paper presents a dynamic freeway speed controller based on the sliding mode theory, which uses the fundamental equations governing traffic dynamics in combination with variable speed limit control in order to provide advisory speeds for connected vehicles. Simulation results on a downtown Los Angeles network show significant reductions in trip times and delays both on freeways (where the control was activated) and network-wide (i.e., freeways and other roadways). Specifically, the results for the entire network showed a 12.17% reduction in travel time and a 20.67% reduction in total delay. These results had the secondary effect of reducing fuel consumption and therefore CO<sub>2</sub> emissions by 2.6% and 3.3%, respectively. The results for the freeway network alone showed a 20.48% reduction in travel time and a 21.63% reduction in queued vehicles. These results reveal the significant potential benefits of using the proposed speed harmonization controller on real large-scale networks.","Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers","","Virginia Polytechnic Inst. and State Univ.

This is a challenging task due to several reasons including changes in illumination and target appearance, and variations in camera viewpoint and camera intrinsic parameters. The approaches developed to re-identify a person across different camera views need to address these challenges. More recently, neural network-based methods have been proposed to solve the person re-identification problem across different camera views, achieving state-of-the-art performance. In this paper, we present an effective and generalizable attack model that generates adversarial images of people, and results in very significant drop in the performance of the existing state-of-the-art person re-identification models. The results demonstrate the extreme vulnerability of the existing models to adversarial examples, and draw attention to the potential security risks that might arise due to this in video surveillance. Our proposed attack is developed by decreasing the dispersion of the internal feature map of a neural network to degrade the performance of several different state-of-the-art person re-identification models. We also compare our proposed attack with other state-of-the-art attack models on different person re-identification approaches, and by using four different commonly used benchmark datasets. The experimental results show that our proposed attack outperforms the state-of-art attack models on the best performing person re-identification approaches by a large margin, and results in the most drop in the mean average precision values.","Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers","","Syracuse Univ., NY (United States)","USDOE Advanced Research Projects Agency - Energy (ARPA-E); National Science Foundation (NSF)","","United States","2020-01-01T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: IEEE Access Journal Volume: 8","","Medium: X; Size: p. 183891-183902","","","AR0000940; 1739748","Journal ID: ISSN 2169-3536; 9195855","10.1109/ACCESS.2020.3024149","","2021-07-30T00:00:00Z","1811145","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/1811145","","IEEE Access","","8"

Such a transition, however, requires a considerable amount of load flexibility in the demand side. Demand response (DR) programs can reveal and utilize this demand flexibility by enabling the participation of a large number of grid-interactive efficient buildings (GEB). Existing approaches on DR require significant modelling or training efforts, are computationally expensive, and do not guarantee the satisfaction of end users. To address these limitations, this paper proposes a scalable hierarchical model-free transactional control approach that incorporates elements of virtual battery, game theory, and model-free control (MFC) mechanisms. The proposed approach separates the control mechanism into upper and lower levels. The MFC modulates the flexible GEB in the lower level with guaranteed thermal comfort of end users, in response to the optimal pricing and power signals determined in the upper level using a Stackelberg game integrated with aggregate virtual battery constraints. Additionally, the usage of MFC necessitates less burdensome computational and communication requirements, thus, it is easily deployable even on small embedded devices. The effectiveness of this approach is demonstrated through a large-scale case study with 10,000 heterogenous GEB. The results show that the proposed approach can achieve peak load reduction and profit maximization for the distribution system operator, as well as cost reduction for end users while maintaining their comfort.","Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers","","Oak Ridge National Lab.

We introduce a new multilabeling technique, which assigns different labels to different regions of interest in the data, and thus, incorporates the spatial aspect. Each label is built to describe the level of activity/motion to be monitored in the spatial location that it represents, in contrast to existing approaches providing only a binary result as the presence or absence of activity. This novel Spatially and Motion-Level Descriptive (SMLD) labeling schema is combined with a Convolutional Long Short Term Memory-based network for classification to capture different levels of activity both spatially and temporally without the use of any foreground or object detection. The proposed approach can be applied to various types of spatiotemporal data captured for completely different application domains. In this paper, it was evaluated on video data as well as respiratory sound data. Metrics commonly associated with multilabeling, namely Hamming Loss and Subset Accuracy, as well as confusion matrix-based measurements are used to evaluate performance. Promising testing results are achieved with an overall Hamming Loss for video datasets close to 0.05, Subset Accuracy close to 80% and confusion matrix-based metrics above 0.9. In addition, our proposed approach's ability in detecting frequent motion patterns based on predicted spatiotemporal activity levels is discussed. Encouraging results have been obtained on the respiratory sound dataset as well, while detecting abnormalities in different parts of the lungs.

"Energy Master Planning: Identifying Framing Constraints that Scope Your Technology Options","Sharp, Terry R.; Zhivov, Alexander; Haase, Matthias; Rose, Joergen","32 ENERGY CONSERVATION, CONSUMPTION, AND UTILIZATION; 29 ENERGY PLANNING, POLICY, AND ECONOMY","This paper addresses the framing constraints for building and community energy projects that must be considered when energy master planning (EMP) is conducted. The constraints cover emissions, sustainability, resilience, regulations and directives, and regional and local limitations such as available energy types, local conditions, and project requirements. The paper reflects development results from participants in an International Energy Agency project on energy master planning and in a U.S. Department of Defense project on technology integration to achieve resilient, low-energy use military installations. It identifies a comprehensive list of framing constraints categorized into locational threats, locational resources, energy and water distribution and storage systems, building and facility, indoor environmental, and equipment in buildings and district systems constraints. In addition, it identifies limits for these constraints that exist in seven participating countries. Some framing constraints can profoundly impact technology selection while others impact the installation of technologies (as in hardening) and have little to no impact on technology selection. Furthermore, framing constraints can be assessed in different ways and there are resources available to help EMP stakeholders evaluate them. Finally, a case is made that identifying and applying framing constraints early in EMP can bring efficiencies and better focus to the EMP process. We come to the conclusion that (1) for holistic energy planning, it is essential to identify and assess the framing constraints that bound an optimized EMP solution, (2) framing constraints limits should be evaluated as either hard or soft or promising technologies may fall out of an EMP analysis, (3) to maintain consistent quality in the EMP process, the identification of framing constraints and their limits, and perhaps their evaluation, should be standardized, (4) a standardized approach could establish a baseline that can be used, built upon, and improved, (5) as automated EMP tools are improved or developed, the resources in this paper could possibly contribute to their interworkings relative to technology screening, and (6) continued climate change and resulting aggressive goal setting will likely drive a continued and strong emphasis on EMP.","ASHRAE","","Oak Ridge National Lab.

The level of human-building interactions (HBIs) in shared offices strongly influences building energy use and occupant well-being. This study explored the link between occupant personality types and their behaviors of sharing energy and environment control systems and interactions with their colleagues. Inspired by the Five-Factor Model (FFM), we classified HBI behaviors into four dimensions: willingness to share control, knowledge of control, group decision behavior, and adaptive strategies. These four variables can be mapped to the four personality traits proposed by the FFM: agreeableness, openness, extraversion, and conscientiousness. Our cluster analysis identified six behavioral patterns: average (17.7%), reserved (15.3%), environmentally friendly (16.6%), role model (24.2%), self-centered (17.2%), and mechanist (9.0%). We further applied association rules, a widely utilized machine learning technique, to discover how demographics, building-related contextual factors, and perception-attitudinal factors influence HBI behaviors. Country, control feature accessibility, and group dynamics were found to be the three most influential factors that determine occupants’ HBI behaviors. Finally, the study provides insights about building design and operation, as well as policy to promote socially and environmentally desirable HBI behaviors in a shared office environment.","Elsevier","","Lawrence Berkeley National Lab.

Typical occupancy schedules for residential buildings must be defined for applications such as building energy modeling as well as for assessing energy savings associated with the use of occupancy sensing technologies and occupancy-dependent controls. Currently, commonly used simulation programs assume a typical occupancy schedule, however, there is significant opportunity for improvement to these schedules as this is generally based on engineering judgement. This research uses 12 years of the American Time Use Survey (ATUS) data to develop typical occupancy schedules for a range of household types and occupant age ranges. This is compared to currently utilized residential occupancy schedules. In many cases the developed schedules exhibit similar patterns, however, differences are also found to be as high as 41% for certain periods of time. For occupancy sensing applications, the spatial-temporal distribution of occupants in residential buildings is also evaluated. These locations vary based on temporal factors as well as demographic factors such as age and number of occupants. Finally, the results of this research work towards improved occupancy schedule development can benefit both industry professionals and researchers.","Elsevier","","Michigan State Univ., East Lansing, MI (United States)","USDOE Advanced Research Projects Agency - Energy (ARPA-E)","","United States","2019-12-19T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: Energy and Buildings; Journal Volume: 210; Journal Issue: C","","Medium: ED; Size: Article No. 109713","","","AR0001256","Journal ID: ISSN 0378-7788","10.1016/j.enbuild.2019.109713","","2020-12-21T00:00:00Z","1641755","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/1641755","https://www.osti.gov/servlets/purl/1641755","Energy and Buildings","C","210"
"Passive SCR Performance Under Pseudo-Transient Cycle: Challenges and Opportunities for Meeting Tier 3 Emissions","Prikhodko, Vitaly Y.; Pihl, Josh A.; Toops, Todd J.; Parks, II, James E.","32 ENERGY CONSERVATION, CONSUMPTION, AND UTILIZATION; 54 ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCES; Passive SCR; TWC; Lean NOx; NH3 formation; Lean gasoline","We report that the passive ammonia (NH<sub>3</sub>) selective catalytic reduction (SCR) system is a potential approach for controlling nitrogen oxide (NOx) emissions from lean-burn gasoline engines based on utilizing NH<sub>3</sub> generated by a three-way catalyst (TWC) during brief periods of fuel-rich engine operation. NH<sub>3</sub> generated by the TWC is stored and available to reduce NOx on a downstream SCR catalyst during subsequent periods of lean engine operation. Control of the overall passive SCR process can be more challenging than current urea-based approach because it depends explicitly on fuel-rich engine operation, which must be implemented in the context of transient engine operation. Under transient engine operation, significant variation in SCR temperatures is also to be expected. With NH<sub>3</sub> storage capacity highly dependent on exhaust temperatures, proper system architecture and engine operating strategy are needed for effective NH<sub>3</sub> utilization over the SCR catalyst. In this study, the performance of a passive SCR system was evaluated on a 2.0-l BMW lean-burn gasoline direct injection engine under 6-mode pseudo-transient cycle. The aim of this work is to understand how various engine operating strategies change the dynamics of NH<sub>3</sub> generation and utilization, and NOx reduction in the passive SCR system. A 5.9% fuel economy improvement relative to stoichiometric-only operation with 0.018 g/mi of NOx + NMHC emissions were demonstrated over 6-mode pseudo-transient cycle; however, CO emissions were twice the emission standard. In conclusion, the results of this work reveal challenges and opportunities for meeting Tier 3 emissions and improving fuel savings benefits.","Springer","","Oak Ridge National Lab.

"System-level key performance indicators for building performance evaluation","Li, Han; Hong, Tianzhen; Lee, Sang Hoon; Sofos, Marina","32 ENERGY CONSERVATION, CONSUMPTION, AND UTILIZATION; building energy performance; system efficiency; key performance indicator; energy use; energy benchmarking; performance diagnostics","Quantifying building energy performance through the development and use of key performance indicators (KPIs) is an essential step in achieving energy saving goals in both new and existing buildings. Current methods used to evaluate improvements, however, are not well represented at the system-level (e.g., lighting, plug-loads, HVAC, service water heating). Instead, they are typically only either measured at the whole building level (e.g., energy use intensity) or at the equipment level (e.g., chiller efficiency coefficient of performance (COP)) with limited insights for benchmarking and diagnosing deviations in performance of aggregated equipment that delivers a specific service to a building (e.g., space heating, lighting). The increasing installation of sensors and meters in buildings makes the evaluation of building performance at the system level more feasible through improved data collection. Leveraging this opportunity, this study introduces a set of system-level KPIs, which cover four major end-use systems in buildings: lighting, MELs (Miscellaneous Electric Loads, aka plug loads), HVAC (heating, ventilation, and air-conditioning), and SWH (service water heating), and their eleven subsystems. The system KPIs are formulated in a new context to represent various types of performance, including energy use, peak demand, load shape, occupant thermal comfort and visual comfort, ventilation, and water use. This paper also presents a database of system KPIs using the EnergyPlus simulation results of 16 USDOE prototype commercial building models across four vintages and five climate zones. These system KPIs, although originally developed for office buildings, can be applied to other building types with some adjustment or extension. Potential applications of system KPIs for system performance benchmarking and diagnostics, code compliance, and measurement and verification are discussed.","Elsevier","","Lawrence Berkeley National Lab.

"Measured moisture performance of sealed and insulated attics with permeable insulation in california homes","Walker, Iain S.; Less, Brennan D.","32 ENERGY CONSERVATION, CONSUMPTION, AND UTILIZATION","This study performed detailed thermal and moisture measurements in two homes in Fresno and Clovis, California with sealed attics insulated with glass fiber insulation to determine moisture performance in inland California climates. Data were recorded once every minute for more than a year in each home to allow detailed observation of time-varying moisture and thermal conditions. Moisture measurements were taken at multiple locations in each attic and included wood moisture, surface condensation and surface relative humidity. The results showed that there are strong solar-driven diurnal cycles in attic wood and air moisture content, as well as longer-term seasonal and annual variations. Mold growth was obdserved on the North roof deck in one of the two homes even in this sunny dry climate with attics built in compliance with California building codes that specifically address sealed and insulated attics with vapor-permeable insulation. We investigated moisture stratification in the attic and found that, although there is stratification during sunny daytime hours, this was not when wood moisture content, surface humidity or surface condensation are high. Therefore, other moisture transport mechanisms are acting to increase moisture levels near the roof peak. Finally, our measurements also showed that the attic with the highest measured moisture levels did not have any mold growth, while mold was visually observed in the attic whose measurements indicted little or no concern, indicating that the state-of-the-art in moisture measurement and mold growth prediction in building assemblies may be insufficient.","ASHRAE","","Lawrence Berkeley National Lab.

We found that the thermal sensation is the most frequently used metrics in Thermal Comfort Database II, followed by thermal preference, comfort and acceptability. The thermal sensation/thermal preference, thermal comfort/air movement acceptability and thermal comfort/thermal preference are the top three most dependent metrics pairs. A principal component analysis confirmed that the personal experience of thermal conditions in built environment is not a one-dimensional problem, but at least a two-dimensional problem, and suggested thermal sensation and thermal comfort should be asked in right-now surveys as the first two Principal Component are majorly constructed by thermal sensation and thermal comfort. To further confirm the predictive power of thermal sensation and comfort, we used logistic regression and support vector machine to predict thermal acceptability and thermal preference with thermal sensation and comfort. The prediction accuracy is 87% for thermal acceptability and 64% for thermal preference. The prediction error might be due to occupants' individual difference and people errors in answering survey. These findings could help the design of chamber experiments, field studies, and human-building interaction interfaces by shedding light on the choice of subjective thermal metrics to effectively and accurately collect information on occupants’ thermal experience.","Elsevier","","Lawrence Berkeley National Lab.

In this work, we demonstrate that the first-order magneto-structural transition temperature for a given composition is tunable over a wide temperature range through heat treatment and hydrostatic pressure application.

This review paper focused on the application of SA in the building performance analysis (BPA). First, the existing review papers on the application of SA for BPA were briefly reviewed and summarized. Then, a large amount of recent SA case studies in BPA were reviewed. The critical information regarding the implementation of a SA, such as the sampling method, the SA method, etc., were extracted and summarized. Next, an extensive analysis was performed to evaluate the role of the SA in the BPA. This includes: 1) The typical selection of the input and output parameters for the SA were visualized; 2) The uncertainty level and sampling strategies for the input parameters were investigated; 3) The principles, benefits, and drawbacks of the SA methods were analyzed and summarized; and 4) The various tools used in the SA, including the simulation software, sampling tools, and SA tools were introduced to facilitate the practitioners. Lastly, several conclusions were summarized on the role of the SA in the BPA.

"Economic analysis of a high-pressure urban pipeline concept (HyLine) for delivering hydrogen to retail fueling stations","Penev, Michael; Zuboy, Jarett; Hunter, Chad","29 ENERGY PLANNING, POLICY, AND ECONOMY; 32 ENERGY CONSERVATION, CONSUMPTION, AND UTILIZATION; hydrogen; pipeline; infrastructure; delivery; stations; refueling; HyLine; safety","Reducing the cost of delivering hydrogen to fueling stations and dispensing it into fuel cell electric vehicles (FCEVs) is one critical element of efforts to increase the cost-competitiveness of FCEVs. Today, hydrogen is primarily delivered to stations by trucks. Pipeline delivery is much rarer: one urban U.S. station has been supplied with 800-psi hydrogen from an industrial hydrogen pipeline since 2011, and a German station on the edge of an industrial park has been supplied with 13,000-psi hydrogen from a pipeline since 2006. This article compares the economics of existing U.S. hydrogen delivery methods with the economics of a high-pressure, scalable, intra-city pipeline system referred to here as the 'HyLine' system. In the HyLine system, hydrogen would be produced at urban industrial or commercial sites, compressed to 15,000 psi, stored at centralized facilities, delivered via high-pressure pipeline to retail stations, and dispensed directly into FCEVs. Our analysis of retail fueling station economics in Los Angeles suggests that, as FCEV demand for hydrogen in an area becomes sufficiently dense, pipeline hydrogen delivery gains an economic advantage over truck delivery. The HyLine approach would also enable cheaper dispensed hydrogen compared with lower-pressure pipeline delivery owing to economies of scale associated with integrated compression and storage. In the largest-scale fueling scenario analyzed (a network of 24 stations with capacities of 1500 kg/d each, and hydrogen produced via steam methane reforming), HyLine could potentially achieve a profited hydrogen cost of 5.3/kg, which is approximately equivalent to a gasoline cost of 2.7/gal (assuming FCEVs offer twice the fuel economy of internal combustion engine vehicles and vehicle cost is competitive). It is important to note that significant effort would be required to develop technical knowledge, codes, and standards that would enable a HyLine system to be viable. However, our preliminary analysis suggests that the HyLine approach merits further consideration based on its potential economic advantages. These advantages could also include the value of minimizing retail space used by hydrogen compression and storage sited at fueling stations, which is not reflected in our analysis.","Elsevier","","National Renewable Energy Lab.

Rather than a one-way flow of electricity where utilities produce and transmit the electricity that buildings then consume, buildings are becoming efficient energy consumers that can dynamically adjust loads to ensure grid-provided energy is used effectively. Buildings are transitioning to now be at the intersection of forecasting loads and demand response, forecasting and control of output from distributed generation and renewable energy systems, and the optimal dispatch of energy storage. Because residential and commercial buildings consume 74.7% of the electricity generated in the United States, grid-integrated buildings represent an important solution to addressing challenges facing the power sector. In addition to the electric power grid, buildings will be increasingly interactive with water, transportation, and telecommunications networks, and will also more strongly affect surrounding buildings and other civic infrastructure.","American Society of Heating, Refrigerating and Air-Conditioning Engineers","","National Renewable Energy Lab.

These prenols are fuel candidates outlined by the U.S. Department of Energy’s Co-Optimization of Fuels and Engines (Co-Optima) program. The laminar burning velocity measurements were conducted for two fuels with synthetic air within a constant-volume spherical combustion chamber at initial conditions of 428 K and 1 atm for a range of equivalence ratios from 0.75 to 1.50. The laminar burning velocities of the two fuels were found to be similar, and the maximum value occurred at an equivalence ratio near 1.0. Carbon monoxide time-histories and ignition delay times were recorded behind reflected shockwaves in a double-diaphragm, heated shock tube over the temperature range 1269–1472 K near 9.4 atm with a mixture of 0.05% fuel/0.35% O2/99.6% Ar. Comparisons with predictions of a detailed chemical kinetic mechanism from the literature were provided. Current model predictions overpredicted both the ignition delay time and the max CO yield; however, the model captured the profile of CO formation well. Detailed uncertainty and sensitivity analyses were carried out to identify important reactions that need attention for accurate prediction of these fuel’s chemistry. Further investigation into the rate of C3H3 + O2 = CH2CO + HCO reaction was suggested based on current experiments. The experimental data and analysis presented here is critical in the development, validation and improvement of kinetic models of these promising Co-Optima fuels.","Elsevier","External Audience (Unlimited)","Lawrence Livermore National Lab.

Discourse is lacking concerning drivers of occupant behavior for energy conservation, especially in the case of commercial buildings. This paper explores potential determinants of occupant behavior for energy conservation in commercial buildings. This is investigated in a case study of a two-month energy conservation competition involving eight office buildings at the Oak Ridge National Laboratory. Four buildings achieved energy savings based on the previous year’s baseline. Potential challenges and success factors of occupant behavior for energy conservation during the competition were explored based on an explanatory research design incorporating energy data, participant interviews, and surveys. The findings suggest that both social and technological aspects may be important drivers of energy conservation. The determinants of occupant behavior for energy conservation in commercial buildings suggested for further research include bottom-up involvement, stakeholder relationship management, targeted information, real-time energy visualization, and mobile social platforms. This paper presents initial implications, with a need for further research on these propositions and on their impacts on occupant behavior.

In this study, a hybrid dual-evaporator absorption refrigeration system for refrigerating and freezing applications is proposed and evaluated from thermodynamic, economic, and environmental viewpoints. In the proposed system, two compressors were employed between the evaporators and absorbers to increase the absorbers pressure to a higher level. The detailed parametric study results demonstrated that only employing a compressor between the higher temperature evaporator and absorber is beneficial improving the coefficient of performance (COP) significantly. However, the economic results showed that the compressor should be implemented carefully because in most design and operating conditions, the required capital and operating costs outweigh the COP improvement. Under specified design conditions, integrating the second compressor with a pressure ratio of 2.5 significantly increased the COP from 0.404 to 0.624 while it caused an increase in the unit production cost of cooling (UPCC) from $\$0.211$/ton-hr to $\$0.228$/ton-hr. The use of flue gas as a heat input was found to have excellent potential to improve the economic and environmental performance of the system. A detailed comparison with a dual-temperature transcritical carbon dioxide refrigeration cycle from the literature demonstrated that, under similar conditions, the system of this study has a substantially lower UPCC than the system in the literature ($\$0.211$/ton-hr and $\$0.110$/ton-hr for the steam and waste heat driven systems against $\$0.457$/ton-hr). Altogether, the proposed system (with and without the compressor) of this study showed an excellent potential for dual-temperature refrigeration applications.","Elsevier","","Univ. of Utah, Salt Lake City, UT (United States)","USDOE Office of Energy Efficiency and Renewable Energy (EERE)","","United States","2019-06-14T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: Journal of Cleaner Production; Journal Volume: 233","","Medium: ED; Size: p. 1075-1087","","","EE0007712","Journal ID: ISSN 0959-6526","10.1016/j.jclepro.2019.06.130","","2022-06-28T00:00:00Z","1864033","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/1864033","https://www.osti.gov/servlets/purl/1864033","Journal of Cleaner Production","","233"

As a case study, Pena Station NEXT, a new 100-building, mixed-use district on a 1200-node distribution feeder in Denver, Colorado, is modeled in the integrated framework. An exhaustive scenario analysis is conducted for sizing the district's distributed energy resources, considering multiple objectives such as capital cost, net energy import, and equipment violations. Here, when trying to achieve annual NZE, the district incurs frequent operating violations, and achieving NZE on a 15-min basis is also limited by seasonal fluctuations in photovoltaic output, illustrating the need for diverse generation or seasonal storage. As a practical compromise, both annual and 15-min district import can be reduced by ~78% without significant violations.","American Institute of Physics (AIP)","","National Renewable Energy Lab.

This high QY was achieved by using highly purified lead and thiourea precursors. This QY is 2.6 times higher than from NCs prepared with commercially available lead and sulfide precursors. Transient absorption spectroscopy reveals two reasons for the enhanced QY: longer intrinsic exciton lifetimes of PbS NCs and the ability to support a longer triplet lifetime for the surface-bound transmitter molecule. Overall, this results in a higher efficiency of triplet exciton transfer from the PbS NC light absorber to the emitter and thus a higher photon upconversion QY.","American Chemical Society (ACS)","","Univ. of California, Riverside, CA (United States)","USDOE Office of Science (SC), Basic Energy Sciences (BES)","","United States","2019-06-10T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: Journal of the American Chemical Society; Journal Volume: 141; Journal Issue: 25","","Medium: ED; Size: p. 9769-9772","","","SC0018969; FG02-12ER16347; SC0018208","Journal ID: ISSN 0002-7863","10.1021/jacs.9b03385","","2021-08-05T00:00:00Z","1773887","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/1773887","https://www.osti.gov/servlets/purl/1773887","Journal of the American Chemical Society","25","141"

ASHRAE Standard 55 or ISO Standard 7730 uses the PMV-PPD model or the adaptive comfort model that is based on small-sized or outdated sample data, which raises questions on whether and how ranges of occupant thermal comfort temperature should be revised using more recent larger-sized dataset. In this paper, a Bayesian inference approach has been used to derive new occupant comfort temperature ranges for U.S. office buildings using the ASHRAE Global Thermal Comfort Database. Bayesian inference can express uncertainty and incorporate prior knowledge. The comfort temperatures were found to be higher and less variable at cooling mode than at heating mode, and with significant overlapped variation ranges between the two modes. The comfort operative temperature of occupants varies between 21.9 and 25.4 °C for the cooling mode with a median of 23.7 °C, and between 20.5 and 24.9 °C for the heating mode with a median of 22.7 °C. These comfort temperature ranges are similar to the current ASHRAE standard 55 in the heating mode but 2–3 °C lower in the cooling mode. Finally, the results of this study could be adopted as more realistic thermostat set-points in building design, operation, control optimization, energy performance analysis, and policymaking.","Elsevier","","Lawrence Berkeley National Lab.

Thus, there is a need to better understand and quantify seasonal factors that affect consumption and range under real-world driving conditions. In this paper, a dataset representing the real-world driving activity of 197 BEVs of the same model recorded over 12 months at a polling frequency of 0.1 Hz is analyzed to estimate BEV performance across different driving applications (personal driving, taxi operation, and ridesharing) and seasons (spring/autumn, summer, and winter). The results show that the electricity consumption, travel patterns, and charging patterns of BEVs vary significantly by both vehicle application and season. For example, BEV models with a range of 160 km, recharged every 1.6 days on average, can meet most trip demands of personal vehicles. However, the same BEV model when used for ridesharing or taxi purposes, is driven much more and recharged more frequently. The results also show that actual BEV electricity consumption (EC) differs significantly from the consumption predicted by the New European Driving Cycle (NEDC) test, with real-world EC being 7%–10% higher than predicted by the NEDC test cycle. Furthermore, the real-world range of personal-use BEVs in winter is only 64% of the NEDC-estimated range. The study found that, when the ambient temperature is lower than 10 °C, electricity consumption increases 2.4 kWh/100 km for every 5 °C decrease in temperature. When it is higher than 28 °C, EC increases 2.3 kWh/100 km for every 5 °C increase in temperature. Furthermore, these findings imply that manufacturers should design BEVs with application-appropriate driving ranges and make R&D investments for improving battery performance in cold environments.","Elsevier","","Oak Ridge National Lab.

The OPF objective is to minimize system losses by determining the optimal dispatch for generators, shunt capacitors, and converters. The OPF constraints include the operational constraints of all HVac grid and converter stations. The resulting mixed-integer nonlinear programing problem is solved using a proposed framework based on the predictor-corrector primal-dual interior-point method. The proposed OPF formulation and solution approach are verified using a multi-frequency HVac transmission system that is modified from the IEEE 57-bus system. Here, the results with the optimal dispatch from the proposed method during a simulated day show a significant loss reduction and an improved voltage regulation compared to those when an arbitrary dispatch is chosen.","IEEE","","Pacific Northwest National Lab.

Core functions of the microgrid control system are defined by the IEEE standard 2030.7; however, the algorithms that realize these functions are not standardized, and are a topic of research. Furthermore, the corresponding controller hardware, operating system, and communication system to implement these functions vary significantly from one implementation to the next. In this paper, we introduce an open-source platform, Resilient Information Architecture Platform for the Smart Grid (RIAPS), ideally suited for implementing and deploying distributed microgrid control algorithms. RIAPS provides a design-time tool suite for development and deployment of distributed microgrid control algorithms. With support from a number of run-time platform services, developed algorithms can be easily implemented and deployed into real microgrids. To demonstrate the unique features of RIAPS, we propose and implement a distributed microgrid secondary control algorithm capable of synchronized and proportional compensation of voltage unbalance using distributed generators. In conclusion, test results show the effectiveness of the proposed control and the salient features of the RIAPS platform.","IEEE","","Vanderbilt Univ., Nashville, TN (United States)","USDOE Advanced Research Projects Agency - Energy (ARPA-E)","","United States","2019-11-15T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: IEEE Translations on Industrial Electronics; Journal Volume: 67; Journal Issue: 11","","Medium: ED; Size: p. 9393-9404","","","AR0000666","Journal ID: ISSN 0278-0046","10.1109/TIE.2019.2952803","","2020-11-16T00:00:00Z","1616374","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/1616374","https://www.osti.gov/servlets/purl/1616374","IEEE Translations on Industrial Electronics","11","67"

The results show that active cathode material, aluminum, and energy use for cell production are the major contributors to the energy and environmental impacts of NMC batteries. However, this study also notes that the impacts could change significantly, depending on where in the world the battery is produced, and where the materials are sourced.

"A highly efficient control framework for centralized residential charging coordination of large electric vehicle populations","Yi, Zonggen; Scoffield, Don; Smart, John G.; Meintz, Andrew; Jun, Myungsoo; Mohanpurkar, Manish U.; Medam, Anudeep","32 ENERGY CONSERVATION, CONSUMPTION, AND UTILIZATION; Electric vehicle; Receding horizon control; Highly efficient; Smart charging; Centralized charging coordination; Aggregator","The potential for widespread adoption of plug-in electric vehicles (PEVs) brings with it the potential for negative impacts on the electric grid from electric vehicle charging. Uncoordinated PEV charging may increase electricity demand during peak hours, which could create concerns for the grid as the number of PEVs increases. Therefore, it is important to coordinate charging to alleviate potential negative impacts. Centralized charging coordination is preferred by grid operator over distributed control strategies because it can systematically allocate energy across a large population of PEVs and achieve a global optimum. However, centralized methods presented in the literature to date require prohibitively expensive computational resources and lack realistic PEV charging models. As a result, they cannot achieve the efficiency and accuracy required to implement charging coordination in the real world. This paper introduces a highly efficient receding horizon control framework that enables dynamic charging coordination for large PEV populations. A two-stage hierarchical optimization routine is proposed that aggregates individual PEV charging flexibility to reduce the computational complexity of the optimization process. The control framework is based on high-fidelity, validated charging system models and charging behavior models derived from a real-world data set of residential charging activities collected from thousands of charging stations over multiple years. Here, case studies illustrate that the proposed charging control framework is capable of effectively coordinating the charging of millions of PEVs using a standard desktop computer.","Elsevier","","Idaho National Lab.

The key concept is a consensus weighting protocol (CWP) for agents to reach an agreement. Unlike the well adopted average-consensus protocol (ACP), the proposed CWP enables each agent to converge to its weighted portion of the sum of all initial values. Thus, the proposed CWP is more suitable for the UFLS application, as it allows load buses with a higher level of loading to shed more, rather than reducing by the same average value over all load buses as required by the ACP. Proof of convergence for the proposed CWP is derived and presented in this paper, together with the constraints. For implementation of the multi-agent system (MAS), the monitoring, estimation, and distribution steps are developed. Two study cases and the simulation results are provided to validate the performance of the proposed agent-based UFLS scheme.","Elsevier","","Vanderbilt Univ., Nashville, TN (United States)","USDOE Advanced Research Projects Agency - Energy (ARPA-E); National Science Foundation (NSF)","","United States","2019-11-05T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: International Journal of Electrical Power and Energy Systems; Journal Volume: 117; Journal Issue: C","","Medium: ED; Size: Article No. 105615","","DOE-VANDERBILT-0000666-32","AR0000666; AC05-76RL01830; 1441214","Journal ID: ISSN 0142-0615","10.1016/j.ijepes.2019.105615","","2020-11-05T00:00:00Z","1616413","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/1616413","https://www.osti.gov/servlets/purl/1616413","International Journal of Electrical Power and Energy Systems","C","117"

However, the scarcity and high cost of Pt seriously limit the practical application of these catalysts. Decorating Pt catalysts with other transition metals offers an effective pathway to tailor their catalytic properties, but often at the sacrifice of the electrochemical active surface area (ECSA). Here we report a single-atom tailoring strategy to boost the activity of Pt nanocatalysts with minimal loss in surface active sites. By starting with PtNi alloy nanowires and using a partial electrochemical dealloying approach, we create single-nickel-atom-modified Pt nanowires with an optimum combination of specific activity and ECSA for the hydrogen evolution, methanol oxidation and ethanol oxidation reactions. The single-atom tailoring approach offers an effective strategy to optimize the activity of surface Pt atoms and enhance the mass activity for diverse reactions, opening a general pathway to the design of highly efficient and durable precious metal-based catalysts.","Springer Nature","","Lawrence Berkeley National Lab.

We model the costs and benefits of recently proposed new room air conditioner minimum energy performance standards (MEPS) in China. Our results suggest that newly proposed MEPS brings accumulative CO<sub>2</sub> emissions reductions of 12.8% between 2019 and 2050, and accumulative bill saving of 2620 billion RMB to China's consumers. The benefits of the proposed MEPS decrease with longer MEPS revision intervals and increase with shorter intervals—indicating that the intervals should be balanced to maximize benefits while accommodating constraints due to air conditioner manufacturer design cycles. We also model potential nationwide benefits from higher MEPS. Across two increasingly aggressive MEPS scenarios, China's room air conditioner electricity consumption and CO<sub>2</sub> emissions in 2050 are both reduced by 15–53% compared to the proposed MEPS. The highest-efficiency scenario (reaching MEPS of annual performance factor 5.4 in 2025) provides the largest long-term national benefits. These results could inform development of a Chinese regulatory regime that effectively updates room air conditioner MEPS. Because China is the world's largest manufacturer of room air conditioners, the economic, energy, and emissions benefits resulting from higher Chinese MEPS could also have a global reach.","Elsevier","","Lawrence Berkeley National Lab.

To achieve cities’ energy and climate goals, it is necessary to reduce energy use and associated greenhouse gas emissions in buildings through energy conservation and efficiency improvements. Computational tools empowered with rich urban datasets can model performance of buildings at the urban scale to provide quantitative insights for stakeholders and inform their decision making on urban energy planning, as well as building energy retrofits at scale, to achieve efficiency, sustainability, and resilience of urban buildings. Designing and operating urban buildings as a group (from a city block to a district to an entire city) rather than as single individuals requires simulation and optimization to account for interactions among buildings and between buildings and their surrounding urban environment, and for district energy systems serving multiple buildings with diverse thermal loads across space and time. When hundreds or more buildings are involved in typical urban building energy modeling (UBEM) to estimate annual energy demand, evaluate design or retrofit options, and quantify impacts of extreme weather events or climate change, it is crucial to integrate urban datasets and UBEM tools in a seamless automatic workflow with cloud or high-performance computing for users including urban planners, designers and researchers. This paper presents ten questions that highlight significant UBEM research and applications. The proposed answers in this work aim to stimulate discussion and provide insights into the current and future research on UBEM, and more importantly, to inspire new and important questions from young researchers in the field.","Elsevier","","Lawrence Berkeley National Lab.

"Adaptation of fan motor and VFD efficiency correlations using Bayesian inference","Rivalin, Lisa; Pritoni, Marco; Stabat, Pascal; Marchio, Dominique","32 ENERGY CONSERVATION, CONSUMPTION, AND UTILIZATION","Energy performance contracts (EPC) are types of agreements in which a service provider guarantees that customers’ buildings will achieve a specified energy performance (i.e., minimum energy savings) to reduce the risk of their investment in energy efficiency improvements. EPC requires prediction of future energy consumption of the building, at the design stage, before construction or major retrofit. To this end, building energy simulations taking into account all the major energy-using components are performed. In particular, fans can contribute significantly to the total building consumption. The overall efficiency of fans is the combination of three factors: mechanical, motor, and variable frequency drive (VFD). Manufacturers usually provide fan mechanical efficiency curves for a broad operating range. In contrast, motor and VFD efficiencies are generally given at rating conditions only. To represent part-load conditions, correlations are typically used to estimate motor and VFD efficiency variations, to evaluate the overall electricity consumption. The first aim of this study is to evaluate existing correlations for motor and VFD efficiency as a function of load and speed, by comparison with manufacturer data, for a vendor that has shared its detailed test data. While VFD efficiency correlations from the literature provide reasonable accuracy against real data, motor correlations under predict actual motor efficiency at low loads. Finally, the second aim of the paper is to improve such correlations using Bayesian inference to fit the available data.","Taylor & Francis","","Lawrence Berkeley National Lab.

Considering that the RadiCold film has unique optical and thermal characteristics and the current Roof Thermal Transfer Value model neglecting the effect of roof thermal mass that may lead to overestimating the cooling load from roofs, this work developed an improved Roof Thermal Transfer Value model and validated the model for both RadiCold cool roof and traditional roofing structures. Data from the reduced-size model building experiments showed that the improved Roof Thermal Transfer Value model can accurately describe the heat gains or losses via the roofs. Under real-world weather conditions in the United States (Tucson AZ, Los Angeles, CA, and Orlando FL), the improved Roof Thermal Transfer Value model has been applied to three types of roof exterior finishing: shingle, Thermoplastic Polyolefin (a cool roof material) and RadiCold. In a typical meteorology year, the modeling results show that the shingle and Thermoplastic Polyolefin roof transfer 78.9–294.1 kWh/(m<sup>2</sup>·yr) and 8.5–128.2 kWh/(m<sup>2</sup>·yr) of heat into the building space, respectively, but the RadiCold cool roof dissipates 137.6–268.7 kWh/(m<sup>2</sup>·yr) of heat from the building space to outdoor environment (e.g., sky).

"Damping of Inter-Area Oscillations via Modulation of Aggregated Loads","Wilches-Bernal, Felipe; Byrne, Raymond H.; Lian, Jianming","32 ENERGY CONSERVATION, CONSUMPTION, AND UTILIZATION; small signal stability; damping control; load modulation; load aggregation; system identification","Low frequency electromechanical oscillations can pose a threat to the stability of power systems if not properly addressed. This paper proposes a novel methodology to damp these inter-area oscillations using loads, the demand side of the system. In the proposed methodology, loads are assigned to an aggregated cluster whose demand is modulated for oscillation damping. The load cluster control action is obtained from an optimal output feedback control (OOFC) strategy. The paper presents an extension to the regular OOFC formulation by imposing a constraint on the sum of the rows in the optimal gain matrix. This constraint is useful when the feedback signals are generator speeds. In this case, the sum of the rows of the optimal gain matrix is the droop gain of each load actuator. Time-domain simulations of a large-scale power system are used to demonstrate the efficacy of the proposed control algorithm. Two different cases are considered: a power imbalance and a line fault. The simulation results show that the proposed controllers successfully damp inter-area oscillations under different operating conditions and with different clustering for the events considered.

"Residential retrofits at scale: opportunity identification, saving estimation, and personalized messaging based on communicating thermostat data","Zeifman, Michael; Lazrak, Amine; Roth, Kurt","32 ENERGY CONSERVATION, CONSUMPTION, AND UTILIZATION; Communicating thermostat; Grey-box model; Estimation,; Building thermal properties; R-value; ACH50; Home energy assessment; Energy audit","Basic insulation and heating system retrofits of existing homes could achieve annual energy savings of up to $4–5 billion in the USA. However, current US utility energy efficiency (EE) programs are costly and challenging to scale. Customer acquisition occurs primarily through energy bill mailers, mass media, and on-line advertising that lack specificity about particular home retrofit opportunities, expected energy savings, and cost-effectiveness. Specific retrofit opportunities are identified via on-site home energy assessments that can be inconvenient to homeowners, expensive, and of variable accuracy. Our paper discusses using communicating thermostat data to significantly increase the customer uptake of energy conservation measures (ECMs) by identifying homes with the most significant retrofit opportunities, estimating post-retrofit energy savings, and formulating home-specific outreach. We extended our previously developed gray-box building model to identify physical building parameters corresponding to the target retrofit opportunities, i.e., whole-home R value, air leakage characteristics, and heating system efficiency. Here, the estimated R values and air leakage characteristics compare favorably with the ground truth. The validated algorithms can calculate home-specific energy savings estimate for each ECM, and the algorithm outputs can be used by utility EE programs to formulate home-specific retrofit offers.","Springer","","Fraunhofer USA Center for Manufacturing Innovation CMI, Brookline, MA (United States)","USDOE Office of Energy Efficiency and Renewable Energy (EERE)","","United States","2019-05-09T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: Energy Efficiency; Journal Volume: 13; Journal Issue: 3","","Medium: ED; Size: p. 393-405","","","EE0007571","Journal ID: ISSN 1570-646X","10.1007/s12053-019-09797-9","","2022-08-01T00:00:00Z","1877459","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/1877459","https://www.osti.gov/servlets/purl/1877459","Energy Efficiency","3","13"

"Forecasting district-scale energy dynamics through integrating building network and long short-term memory learning algorithm","Wang, Wei; Hong, Tianzhen; Xu, Xiaodong; Chen, Jiayu; Liu, Ziang; Xu, Ning","32 ENERGY CONSERVATION, CONSUMPTION, AND UTILIZATION","With the development of data-driven techniques, building energy prediction on a district level has attracted increasing attention in recent years for revealing energy use patterns and reduction potentials. However, data acquisition in large building groups is difficult and adjacent buildings also interact with each other. To reduce data cost and incorporate the inter-building impact with the data-driven building energy model, this study proposes a deep learning predictive approach that fuses the building network model with a long short-term memory learning model for district-scale building energy modeling. The building network was constructed based on correlations between the energy use intensity of buildings, which can significantly reduce the computational complexity of the deep learning models for energy dynamic prediction. Five typical building groups with energy use data from 2015 to 2018 on two institutional campuses were selected to perform the validation experiment with TensorFlow. Based on the prediction error assessments, the results suggest that for total building energy use intensity prediction, the proposed model can achieve a mean absolute percentage error of 6.66% and a root mean square error of 0.36 kWh/m<sup>2</sup>, compared to 12.05% and 0.63 kWh/m<sup>2</sup> of the conventional artificial neural network model and to 11.06% and 0.89 kWh/m<sup>2</sup> for the support vector regression model.","Elsevier","","Lawrence Berkeley National Lab.

Important challenges are identified for this fabrication approach, including: Contamination of the electrolyte with Si and Cr from the metal support, incomplete electrolyte sintering, and evaporation of electrolyte constituents. Various approaches to overcome these limitations are proposed, and preliminary assessment indicates that the use of barrier layers, low-Si-content stainless steel, and sintering aids warrant further development.","Elsevier","","Lawrence Berkeley National Lab.

For wearables, the low fill factor (area occupied by legs over the TEG base area) TEG modules are relevant as they provide large thermal gradient across the legs and require less material, which reduces the cost and weight. However, TEGs with a fill factor below 15% suffer from reduced mechanical robustness; consequently, commercial modules are usually fabricated with a fill factor in the range of 25-50%. In this study, TEG modules with a low and high fill factor are demonstrated and their performance is compared in harvesting body heat. Fabricated modules demonstrate ~80% output power enhancement as compared to commercially available designs, resulting in high power density of up to 35 uW/cm2 in a steady state. This enhanced power is achieved by using two-third less thermoelectric materials in comparison to commercial modules. These results will advance the ongoing development of wearable devices by providing a consistent high specific power density source.","American Chemical Society (ACS)","","National Renewable Energy Lab.

The smart controls shift ventilation rates in time, but ensure an annual occupant pollutant exposure equal to, or less than, what would be experienced in a home with a constant ventilation rate equal to the whole house target airflow in the ASHRAE Standard 62.2-2016. Annual simulations of previously developed prototype homes with validated ventilation models were conducted via co-simulation of EnergyPlus with CONTAM. Controller performance varied substantially by climate zone, airtightness and house prototype. Smart controls were generally ineffective in Climate Zone 1 (Arcata) due to its lack of a cooling season and low diurnal temperature swings. The most successful smart controls used parameters pre-calculated using an optimization routine. In order to better inform state energy policy, we also determined savings weighted by the amount of new home construction in each climate. The best controls averaged about one-third of ventilation-related energy savings that increased to about 48–55% when weighted. Annual average savings were about 650–700 kWh/year for the best controllers. The vast majority of site energy savings were for heating end-uses (&gt;90% of total savings). Whole house ventilation rates increased between 0% and 42%, with typical increases in the 15–20% range. Finally, the best-performing control strategies shifted ventilation rates seasonally and modulated flows within each season. Peak concentrations during low ventilation times were kept below an exposure level of 3, well below the maximum of 5 required to avoid acute exposure issues.","Elsevier","","Lawrence Berkeley National Lab.

Gasoline combustion chemistry must be investigated to achieve a better understanding and control of internal combustion engine efficiency and emissions. In this work, several gasoline fuels, namely the FACE (Fuel for Advanced Combustion Engines) gasolines, were selected as targets for oxidation study in jet-stirred reactors (JSR). The study is facilitated by formulating various gasoline surrogate mixtures with known hydrocarbon compositions to represent the real gasolines. Surrogates included binary mixtures of n-heptane and iso-octane, as well as more complex multi-component mixtures. Here, the oxidation characteristics of FACE gasolines and their surrogates were experimentally examined in JSR-1 and numerically simulated under the following conditions: pressure 1 bar, temperature 500–1050 K, residence time 1.0 and 2.0 s, and two equivalence ratios (Φ= 0.5 and 1.0). In the high temperature region, all real fuels and surrogates showed similar oxidation behavior, but in the low temperature region, a fuel’s octane number and composition had a significant effect on its JSR oxidation characteristics. Low octane number fuels displayed more low temperature reactivity, while fuels with similar octane number but a larger number of n-alkane components were more reactive. A gasoline surrogate kinetic model was examined with FACE gasoline experiments either measured in JSR-2, or taken from previous work under the following conditions: pressure 10 bar, temperature 530–1200 K, residence time 0.7 s, and three equivalence ratios (Φ = 0.5, 1.0 and 2.0). Comparison between FACE gasoline experimental results with surrogate model predictions showed good agreement, demonstrating considerable potential for surrogate fuel kinetic modeling in engine simulations.","Elsevier","External Audience (Unlimited)","Lawrence Livermore National Lab.

"Building analytics and monitoring-based commissioning: industry practice, costs, and savings","Kramer, Hannah; Lin, Guanjing; Curtin, Claire; Crowe, Eliot; Granderson, Jessica","32 ENERGY CONSERVATION, CONSUMPTION, AND UTILIZATION","As building energy and system-level monitoring becomes more common, facility teams are faced with an overwhelming amount of data. This data does not typically lead to insights, corrective actions, and energy savings unless it is stored, organized, analyzed, and prioritized in automated ways. The Smart Energy Analytics Campaign is a public-private sector partnership program focused on supporting commercially available energy management and information systems (EMIS) technology use and monitoring-based commissioning (MBCx) practices. MBCx is an ongoing commissioning process with focus on analyzing large amounts of data on a continuous basis. EMIS tools are used in the MBCx process to organize, present, visualize, and analyze the data. With campaign data from over 400 million square feet (sq. ft.) of installed space, this paper presents the results achieved by owners that are implementing EMIS, along with associated technology costs. The study’s EMIS users that reported savings achieved the median cost savings of $0.19/sq. ft. and 7% annually, with savings shown to increase over time. For 35 portfolio owners, the median base cost to install an EMIS was $0.03/sq. ft., with an annual recurring software cost of $0.02/sq. ft. and an estimated annual labor cost of $0.03/sq. ft. Two types of EMIS systems -- energy information systems and fault detection and diagnostic systems -- are defined in the body of the paper. Of the two, we find that fault detection and diagnostic systems have both higher savings and higher costs. The paper offers a characterization of EMIS products, MBCx services, and trends in the industry.","Springer","","Lawrence Berkeley National Lab.

"Cooperative Game Approach to Optimal Merging Sequence and On-Ramp Merging Control of Connected and Automated Vehicles","Jing, Shoucai; Hui, Fei; Zhao, Xiangmo; Rios Torres, Jackeline; Khattak, Asad J.","32 ENERGY CONSERVATION, CONSUMPTION, AND UTILIZATION; Connected and automated vehicle; cooperative game; optimal merging sequence; merging control; on-ramp","Vehicle merging is one of the main causes of reduced traffic efficiency, increased risk of collision, and fuel consumption. Connected and automated vehicles (CAVs) can improve traffic efficiency, increase safety, and reduce the negative environmental impacts through effective communication and control. Therefore, to improve the traffic efficiency and reduce the fuel consumption in on-ramp scenarios, this paper addresses the global and optimal coordination of the CAVs in a merging zone. In this work, a cooperative multi-player game-based optimization framework and an algorithm are presented to coordinate vehicles and achieve minimum values for the global pay-off conditions. Fuel consumption, passenger comfort, and travel time within the merging control zone were used as the pay-off conditions. After analyzing the characteristics of the merging control zone and selecting the appropriate control decision duration, multi-player games were decomposed into multiple two-player games. An optimal merging strategy was, thereby, derived from a pay-off matrix, and minimum payoffs were predicted for a number of different potential strategies. The optimal trajectory corresponding to the predicted minimum payoffs was then utilized as the control law to coordinate the vehicles merging. The proposed control scheme derives an optimal merging sequence and an optimal trajectory for each vehicle. The effectiveness of the proposed model is validated through simulation. Finally, the proposed controller is compared with two alternative methods to demonstrate its potential to reduce fuel consumption and travel time and to improve passenger comfort and traffic efficiency.","IEEE","","Oak Ridge National Lab.

One of the major challenges of TSR in practical application is to obtain the exact analytical expression of the TSR boundary (TSRB) because TSRB is a nonlinear hypersurface described by an implicit function. For this reason, the TSRB is usually approximated by hyperplane instead of getting the exact analytical expression. Traditionally, the coefficients of the hyperplane are estimated with a set of original TSRB points using least square estimation (LSE). However, LSE is a point estimation method, which is incapable of evaluating the quality of the estimation. In addition, the accuracy and computational efficiency of the hyperplane approximation are influenced by the number of TSRB points significantly. Here, a bootstrap based confidence interval estimation is proposed to estimate not only the coefficients of TSRB approximation hyperplane, but also the standard deviations and confidence intervals of the coefficients for evaluating the quality and reliability of the approximation results. First, empirical distribution functions (EDFs) of the coefficients of TSRB approximation hyperplane are approximated from a set of original TSRB points by using residual resampling bootstrap method. Then, the EDFs of the coefficients are employed to estimate the coefficients of the approximation hyperplane. Meanwhile, the standard deviations and confidence intervals of the estimated coefficients of the hyperplanes are also calculated for evaluating the quality and reliability of the approximation. The proposed approach is tested on the China Southern Power Grid (CSG). Results of simulations validate the accuracy and efficiency of the proposed approach in approximating the TSRB.","Elsevier","","Oak Ridge National Lab.

Detailed data on appliance-level electricity use are employed via data clustering to calibrate a urban building energy model for the Mueller community in Austin, TX, USA. The data were collected by the Pecan Street Institute for a year in 2014 from consumers in Austin and other surrounding cities. First, collected energy data were restructured and cleaned from corrupt and/or missing information. Second, in order to identify common energy use patterns, a model-based clustering algorithm for functional data was applied. Behavioral/usage profiles are determined through clustering and translated into usage schedules and behaviors. As a result, an urban building energy model built in the urban modeling interface (umi) was calibrated, with fully calibrated and semi-calibrated buildings, within a maximum calibration error margin of 14% for daily-scale averages. Finally, an illustration of calibrated-urban building energy model design case scenarios is presented, and implications on community energy potential effects are discussed.","","","National Renewable Energy Lab.

"Modelling of air handling unit subsystem in a commercial building","Razban, Ali; Khatib, Akram; Goodman, David; Chen, Jie","32 ENERGY CONSERVATION, CONSUMPTION, AND UTILIZATION; Energy saving; Real time parameter monitoring; Mechanical modeling; Air handling unit (AHU)","To improve energy efficiency of the Air Handling Unit (AHU), there is a need for a system to monitor energy performance of the AHU in real time, to optimize operation for minimum energy consumption and to calculate energy saving. A mechanical model was created to analyze the performance of subsystems in an AHU and was validated using actual data collected from AHU operation via a wireless monitoring system. Algorithms have been developed to identify malfunctions and estimate the savings if malfunctions are corrected. Here, the model detects control related malfunctions, such as simultaneously turning on the cooling coil and the pre-heating coil. According to the mechanical model of the case study system, a total of 63,455 kWh are wasted within the cooling coil and the pre-heating coil due to this type of control malfunction. Furthermore, the mechanical model can identify other energy savings opportunities due to set point changes; in the case study system, this feature revealed a total of 77,141 kWh energy saving during the same study period. The design, integration, and validation of the mechanical model are described, analyzed, and justified in this paper.","Elsevier","","Indiana Univ., Indianapolis, IN (United States)","USDOE Office of Energy Efficiency and Renewable Energy (EERE), Energy Efficiency Office.

This article describes the complete retrofit of all exterior walls of a single-story building in a cold climate using VIPs. A recently-developed low-cost VIP, called modified atmosphere insulation (MAI), was used in this study. Two buildings of near-identical construction were studied, with one remaining unaltered and serving as the baseline while the other served as the retrofit building. The VIPs or MAI panels proved to be a feasible and durable option for retrofitting building envelopes. Thermal performance of both buildings was analyzed using in-situ temperature and heat flow sensors. Numerical models of the two buildings were created, benchmarked using experimental data and used for predictions of annual energy savings due to the addition of MAI panels to the exterior walls. The models predicted significant reduction in the annual heating energy consumption in the retrofitted building compared to the baseline building.","Elsevier","","Oak Ridge National Lab.

Results from this work estimate that in U.S. single-family households with income less than 200% of the federal poverty level, energy efficiency packages tailored to maximize net present value could result in an estimated $13 billion per year in energy cost savings, or $670 per year for an average household, corresponding to about 1 EJ (0.9 quads) of annual primary energy savings. These types of metrics can be estimated for other geographies (regions, states, and counties) and for other ranges of household income. These results can be used by policymakers and program designers to improve the cost-effectiveness of income-qualified programs and to improve the equity of non-income-qualified programs. The results can also be used to understand how energy efficiency opportunities differ between urban and rural areas, as well as how energy efficiency can spur economic development in areas that have had high poverty rates for decades.","Elsevier","","National Renewable Energy Lab.

"The impact of tribology on energy use and CO<sub>2</sub> emission globally and in combustion engine and electric cars","Holmberg, Kenneth; Erdemir, Ali","32 ENERGY CONSERVATION, CONSUMPTION, AND UTILIZATION; Electric car; Friction; Energy; Impact","Growing concerns over energy and environmental sustainability have lately sparked worldwide interest in more efficient and cleaner transportation systems and industrial activities. Friction roughly consumes one-fifth of all energy used worldwide. One-third of all energy used in transportation goes to overcome friction. At the same time, the fruits of decades of dedicated research on all-electric vehicles powered by advanced batteries are paving the way toward a much cleaner and sustainable transportation future. In this article, we provide a short overview of what are the energy efficiency and environmental impacts of current transportation, industrial, and residential systems and how much of that efficiency is adversely affected by friction and wear losses in moving mechanical parts and components. We also touch upon recent advances in new materials, lubricants, and design changes that could reduce energy losses by 18–40%, mainly resulting from friction and wear. The savings would be up to 8.7% of the total global energy use and 1.4% of the gross national products (GNP). Finally, we calculate the energy consumption and friction losses in battery-powered electric passenger cars and show the benefit of electric cars where the total energy use is in average 3.4 times lower compared to combustion engine powered cars. The CO<sub>2</sub> emissions are 4.5 times higher for a combustion engine car compared to an electric car when the electricity comes from renewable energy sources. Moving from fossil to renewable energy sources may cut down the energy losses due to friction in energy production by more than 60%.","Elsevier","","Argonne National Lab.

"Estimating the Energy, Economic, and Durability Benefits of Installing an Air Barrier System in Commercial Buildings","Desjarlais, Andre Omer; Shrestha, Som S.; Bhandari, Mahabir S.; Dalgleish, Laverne","32 ENERGY CONSERVATION, CONSUMPTION, AND UTILIZATION; 29 ENERGY PLANNING, POLICY, AND ECONOMY","Uncontrolled heat, air, and moisture transfer through the building enclosure has a significant impact on energy usage, comfort, indoor air quality, and building enclosure durability. Air leakage in commercial buildings in the U.S. accounts for about one quad (one quadrillion Btu) of energy annually, costing approximately $10 billion. As the thermal resistance of commercial building enclosures continues to improve, the relative contribution of air leakage to heating and cooling loads is increasing. A wide variety of air barrier technologies and construction practices to reduce the air leakage in buildings are available to the architect and designer. To promote more energy-efficient and durable building enclosure design, advances in easy-to-use tools for determining the impact of air leakage are needed. Oak Ridge National Laboratory (ORNL), the Air Barrier Association of America (ABAA), and the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) partnered to develop an online calculator that estimates the potential energy, cost savings (due to energy use reduction), and moisture transport due to improvements in airtightness. The calculator estimates the energy and cost savings potential based on the pre-and post-retrofit air leakage rates for prototype commercial buildings. The tool does not include the energy and hygrothermal impacts of air intrusion or air that flows into and out of the building enclosure from the same side. This article reports on the development of the Energy Savings and Moisture Transfer Calculator. This online tool aims to fill this void, is based on the best science available, and is easy to use.","International Institute of Building Enclosure Consultants","","Oak Ridge National Lab.

This article presents a general, systematic framework for evaluating the performance of FDD algorithms. The article focuses on understanding the possible answers to two key questions: in the context of FDD algorithm evaluation, what defines a fault and what defines an evaluation input sample? The answers to these questions, together with appropriate performance metrics, may be used to fully specify evaluation procedures for FDD algorithms.","Elsevier","","National Renewable Energy Lab.

However, heavy-truck long-haul operations involve many other travel conditions that fall outside platooning-travel conditions. In this paper, we study the effect of platooning fuel-efficiency gains on the fuel efficiency of the overall operation.

With the increasing deployment of smart thermostats, zone air temperature data are readily available, posing a new opportunity for building energy modeling if such data can be harnessed. This study presents a novel inverse modeling approach which inverses the zone air heat balance equation and uses the measured zone air temperature to analytically calculate the zone air infiltration rate and zone internal thermal mass (e.g., furniture, interior partitions), which are two important model parameters with great variability and difficult to measure. This paper introduces the technical concept and algorithms of the inverse models, their implementation in EnergyPlus, and verification using EnergyPlus simulated building performance data. The inverse modeling approach provides new opportunities for integrating data from massive IoT sensors and devices to enhance the accuracy of simulation results which are used to inform decision making on energy retrofits and efficiency improvements of existing buildings.","Elsevier","","Lawrence Berkeley National Lab.

To shift the equilibrium of reactions catalyzed by ω-TA to the side of the amine product, an upgraded N<sub>2</sub> fixation system based on bioelectrocatalysis was developed to realize the conversion from N<sub>2</sub> to chiral amine intermediates. The produced NH3 was in situ reacted with l-alanine dehydrogenase to generate alanine with NADH as a coenzyme. ω-TA transferred the amino group from alanine to ketone substrates and finally produced the desired chiral amine intermediates. The cathode of the upgraded N<sub>2</sub> fixation system supplied enough reducing power to synchronously realize the regeneration of reduced methyl viologen (MV<sup>•+</sup>) and NADH for the nitrogenase and l-alanine dehydrogenase. The coproduct, pyruvate, was consumed by l-alanine dehydrogenase to regenerate alanine and push the equilibrium to the side of amine. After 10 h of reaction, the concentration of 1-methyl-3-phenylpropylamine achieved 0.54 mM with the 27.6% highest faradaic efficiency and >99% enantiomeric excess (eep).

This study examines a method for providing adequate ventilation in homes while reducing energy consumption and peak demand: “smart” control of ventilation through sensing of occupancy and modulation of ventilation fans. We first conducted a detailed simulation study of advanced California homes with several occupancy-based ventilation control strategies. We then look at how general these results are nationally through a second simulation campaign in 15 ASHRAE climate zones. All simulations compared equivalent indoor air quality situations and assessed energy savings benefits. A key difference from previous demand-controlled ventilation strategies is that our study includes the effects of building related contaminants that are continuously emitted, irrespective of occupancy status, consistent with the requirements in ASHRAE Standard 62.2-2016. Under this new assumption, it is very difficult to extract substantial energy savings using only occupancy sensing. For the baseline strategy, savings were less than 10% of ventilation energy and sometimes negative in all cases analyzed other than leakier 2-story homes. Addition of a pre-occupancy flush period increases savings somewhat, but savings are still less than 15% other than in 2-story leakier homes.","Elsevier","","Lawrence Berkeley National Lab.

This study presents an optimization approach using computational performance simulation. With a genetic algorithm using the Grasshopper tool, this study analyzed the layout and configuration of urban open space and its impact on the urban micro-climate under summer and winter conditions. The outdoor mean Universal Thermal Climate Index (UTCI) was applied as the performance indicator for evaluating the quality of the urban micro-climate. Two cases—one testbed and one real urban block in Nanjing, China -- were used to validate the computer-aided simulation process. The optimization results in the testbed showed UTCI values varied from 36.5 to 37.3 °C in summer and from -4.9 to -1.9 °C in winter. In the case of the real urban block, optimization results show, for summer, although the average UTCI value increased by 0.6 °C, the average air velocity increased by 0.2 m/s; while in winter, the average UTCI value increased by 1.7 °C and the average air velocity decreased by 0.2 m/s. These results demonstrate that the proposed computer-aided optimization process can improve the thermal comfort conditions of open space in urban blocks. Finally, this study discusses strategies and guidelines for the layout design of urban open space to improve urban environment comfort.","Springer","","Lawrence Berkeley National Lab.

"Dynamic Microgrids With Self-Organized Grid-Forming Inverters in Unbalanced Distribution Feeders","Du, Yuhua; Lu, Xiaonan; Tu, Hao; Wang, Jianhui; Lukic, Srdjan","24 POWER TRANSMISSION AND DISTRIBUTION; 32 ENERGY CONSERVATION, CONSUMPTION, AND UTILIZATION; 42 ENGINEERING; distributed control; dynamic microgrids; network reconfiguration; secondary control; unbalanced system; RIAPS","In contrast to conventional static microgrids (MGs), MGs with dynamic and adjustable territories (i.e., dynamic MGs) are proposed and implemented in this paper. Dynamic MGs are commonly dominated by grid-forming inverters and nested in unbalanced distribution feeders. Unlike balanced systems where only positive-sequence components exist, proper operation of unbalanced dynamic MGs presents additional challenges. A distributed secondary control strategy is developed in this study for distributed generators (DGs) interfaced with gridforming inverters in unbalanced dynamic MGs by providing coordinated regulations on both positive- and negative-sequence system models. System frequency and voltage are under constant regulation, along with voltage unbalance (VU) management for multiple critical load buses (CLB). The proposed control strategy enables seamless system transition during unbalanced dynamic MGs reconfiguration, and guarantees proportional positive- and negative-sequence power sharing among connected DGs with respect to system topology variation. Detailed controller designs are provided and stability analyses are derived. The proposed control strategy is fully implemented in hardware controllers and validated on a Hardware-in-the-Loop (HIL) MG testbed.","IEEE","","Vanderbilt Univ., Nashville, TN (United States)","USDOE Advanced Research Projects Agency - Energy (ARPA-E); USDOE Office of Energy Efficiency and Renewable Energy (EERE), Renewable Power Office.

"Review of thermal comfort infused with the latest big data and modeling progresses in public health","Jiang, Yi; Luo, Ziqiang; Wang, Zhe; Lin, Borong","32 ENERGY CONSERVATION, CONSUMPTION, AND UTILIZATION","Thermal environment is important for both occupants’ comfort and health. Previously, the impacts of thermal environment were explored in the areas of thermal comfort and public health separately. This paper aims to bridge both disciplines by examining the correlation between comfort temperature and Minimum Mortality Temperature (MMT), which is a key index quantifying the association of health and weather temperature, through literature review and data-driven approach. It was found that the MMT data obtained from the public health area are generally in good agreement with the thermal neutral temperatures from the comfort perspective. The MMT data range from 17.2 °C to 30 °C, which are similar to the thermal neutral temperatures ranging from 19.5 °C to 30 °C based on the global field tests. Moreover, the MMT data demonstrate the potential to capture some complex distribution patterns of the field comfort data. The introduction of the health-temperature data could assist the intensive field experiments and modeling efforts and complement the thermal comfort dataset, which suffers from the problems of limited sample size. Some discrepancies between the two datasets were identified as well. The contextual factors other than the climate factor which may cause such discrepancies, such as socio-economics, population densities, etc. should be analyzed to enable the potential application of the health-temperature data and modeling to thermal comfort and health studies.","Elsevier","","Lawrence Berkeley National Lab.

Building energy consumption is affected by what is inside the building (such as occupants, appliances, HVAC systems, etc.) and by what is outside: the weather conditions the building is exposed to. However, freely available weather data files are limited to a number of specific locations, usually airports, which are often located away from city centers where buildings are concentrated. The authors have developed a new tool that supports the investigation and quantification of micro-climate conditions on building energy consumption. LAF is built on the Python open-source programming language and has a Graphical User Interface (GUI) that allows users to create custom weather data files for building energy simulations. Many sets of actual meteorological year weather data for long time periods are publicly available online (such as the MesoWest database) for thousands of locations in the US. LAF selects weather data according to user specifications and automatically processes it through an API across multiple weather stations and multiple time periods. The user may easily select a specific location, time frame, and time step that best meets their needs.

"Thermal desalination via supercritical CO<sub>2</sub> Brayton cycle: Optimal system design and techno-economic analysis without reduction in cycle efficiency","Sharan, Prashant; Neises, Ty; Turchi, Craig","32 ENERGY CONSERVATION, CONSUMPTION, AND UTILIZATION; 42 ENGINEERING; multi-effect distillation; supercritical carbon dioxide; Brayton cycle; techno-economic analysis; reverse osmosis","The supercritical carbon dioxide (sCO<sub>2</sub>) Brayton cycle is an upcoming power cycle potentially providing higher energy efficiency and more compact turbomachinery compared to traditionally used Brayton and Rankine cycles. The heat rejected from the sCO<sub>2</sub> Brayton cycle is quite hot (>70 degrees C) and must be cooled before flowing back to the compressor. However, this heat is ideal for producing fresh water with a thermal desalination system. This paper focuses on integrating multi-effect distillation (MED) with the sCO<sub>2</sub> stream exiting the recuperator. A new methodology for integration of MED with the sCO<sub>2</sub> Brayton cycle is proposed for simultaneous production of power and fresh water. The distillate produced does not affect the sCO<sub>2</sub> cycle efficiency, i.e., distillate is produced without being a parasitic load to the power plant compared to conventional integration of MED with steam Rankine cycle. To maximize the energy recovery from the waste heat stream exiting the sCO<sub>2</sub> cycle, a new methodology is formulated and discussed in the Appendix. Integration of MED with a 115 MW<sub>e</sub> sCO<sub>2</sub> power plant (49.2% efficient) produces 2813 m3/day of distillate and the cost of distilled water is 1.1 $/m<sup>3</sup>. Further, to enhance the distillate production, an innovative MED configuration is proposed, and for the same cycle operating condition with an electrical output 115 MW<sub>e</sub>, the net distillate production increases by 59% to 4472 m<sup>3</sup>/day at 1 $/m<sup>3</sup>. The cost of desalinated water for the integrated system is 17.8% lower than that of a standalone reverse-osmosis plant having the same capacity. Parametric analysis is performed to calculate the optimal design parameters for the integrated MED-sCO<sub>2</sub> system.","Elsevier","","National Renewable Energy Lab.

Therefore, we present a simulation study of various BEV types and compare the performance when driving on real-road drive cycles to highly optimized eco-driving cycles using advanced CAV technologies. Additionally, the results demonstrate that eco-driving has a high potential to reduce energy consumption for all types of BEVs considered. The investigated BEVs include a compact vehicle, a transit city bus, and a Class 7 delivery truck. The impact of eco-driving on conventional vehicles was also compared to comparable BEVs. Compared to the BEVs, eco-driving provides a larger reduction in the conventional vehicle's braking energy loss, and also provides conventional vehicles with greater reductions in the engine mechanical energy output but the fuel savings did not show a consistent trend among all the conventional vehicle types.

"A network model for natural ventilation simulation in deep buried underground structures","Liu, Yanan; Xiao, Yimin; Chen, Jianli; Augenbroe, Godfried; Zhou, Tiecheng","32 ENERGY CONSERVATION, CONSUMPTION, AND UTILIZATION; network model; heat transfer; natural ventilation; underground buildings","The study of underground natural ventilation opportunities has become increasingly significant in recent years with its promise of wide application in underground structures such as underground hydro power stations, metro stations, underground parking and laboratories. It is recognized that deployment of natural ventilation constitutes a passive technology that can lead to significant energy conservation if applied judiciously. This paper focuses on underground buildings that are buried deeply and typically consist of an underground complex network of connected structures. The other characteristic is that these structures house machinery and devices that generate heat, leading to elevated internal air temperatures. Combined with the deep location, it implies that buoyancy forces are significant which make natural ventilation through vertical shaft openings a viable option. These characteristics demand a study of the heat transfer processes between ambient conditions, soil and underground buildings. In this paper, we present a dynamic flow network model with loops for multizone airflow and apply it to deep buried underground structures considering the dominant heat transfer characteristics, not only through the elements of the network but also the heat exchange with the envelope and adjacent soil mass. Finally, a small-scale experiment of occurring airflow is conducted and compared with the outcomes of the dynamic simulation of the proposed model. The comparison serves as validation and illustration of the application potential of the network model for natural ventilation investigation and consecutive optimization of its use in underground buildings.","Elsevier","","National Renewable Energy Lab.

This article presents a development of two CQFs for assessing the heating, ventilation, and air-conditioning (HVAC) control loop performance. Both CQFs are able to detect whether the control loop is able to maintain the setpoint and identify the loop's ability to handle disturbances. In addition, the reversal behaviors are assessed as well. The first CQF (CQF-Harris) is proposed based on the normalized Harris index using the recursive least squares method. This recursive least squares method is selected because of its computational efficiency compared with the maximum likelihood estimation method. The second CQF (CQF-EWMA) is based on the exponentially weighted moving average of the error ratio. The assessment scale of excellent, good, fair, bad, and failed, which indicates the quality of the HVAC control loops, is established as well. The sensitivity analysis for both CQFs is also conducted, and it provides insights on choosing the appropriate parameters to compute such CQFs. Such parameters include the sampling frequency, the length of the moving window, and the variance of the unmeasured disturbance.

Having sustainable, universal energy access is a pressing challenge for most parts of the globe. Understanding urban energy consumption patterns may help to address the challenges to urban sustainability and energy security. However, urban energy analyses are severely limited by the lack of urban energy data. Such datasets are virtually non-existent for the developing countries. As per current projections, most of the new urban growth is bound to occur in these data-starved regions. Hence, there is an urgent need of research methods for monitoring and quantifying urban energy utilization patterns. Here, we apply a data-driven approach to characterize urban settlements based on their formality, which is then used to assess intra-urban urban energy consumption in Johannesburg, South Africa; Sana’a, Yemen; and Ndola, Zambia. Electricity is the fastest growing energy fuel. By analyzing the relationship between the settlement types and the corresponding nighttime light emission, a proxy of electricity consumption, we assess the differential electricity consumption patterns.

To support this increasing demand for EVs and PHEVs, challenges related to capacity planning and investment costs of public charging infrastructure must be addressed. Hence, in this paper, a capacity planning problem for charging stations is developed and aims to balance the current capital investment costs and future operational revenue. The charging station is assumed to be equipped with the solar photovoltaic (PV) panel and an energy storage system, which could be electric battery or recently invented hydropneumatic energy storage (ground-level integrated diverse energy storage (GLIDES)) system. A co-optimization model that minimizes investment and operation cost is established to determine optimal solution while considering capacity planning and following operations. EV mobility is modeled as an Erlang-loss system. Meanwhile, stochastic programming is adopted to capture uncertainties from solar radiation and charging demand of EV fleet. To provide a more general and computationally efficient model, main configuration parameters are sampled in design space and then fixed in solving the co-optimization model. Sampled parameters include EV charging slots number, PV area, capacity of energy storage system, and daily mean EV arrival number. Based on the sampled parameter combinations and its responses, black-box mappings are then constructed using surrogate models, which could provide insights for charging station placement in different practical situations.

We show that, at the subnano-scale, scaling relationships can be broken through catalyst dynamics. Oxygen reduction reaction (ORR), which can be catalyzed by Pt nanoparticles, is used as our study case. Subnanometer gas-phase and graphene-deposited Pt n cluster catalysts are shown to exhibit poor correlation between binding energies of the intermediates, O, OH, and OOH, involved in the scaling relationships for ORR. The effect is due to the highly fluxional behavior of subnanometer clusters, which easily adapt their structures to the bound adsorbates and varying coverage and in some cases even reshape the structure upon changing environment. This fluxional behavior is also commonplace for clusters and contrasts them to extended surfaces, suggesting that breaking scaling relationships is likely a rule more than an exception in nanocluster catalysis.","American Chemical Society","","Univ. of California, Los Angeles, CA (United States)","US Air Force Office of Scientific Research (AFOSR); USDOD; USDOE Office of Science (SC), Basic Energy Sciences (BES).

Building latent loads have not decreased by the same amount, and field and analytical research studies have concluded that high-efficiency, low-load homes often have elevated indoor humidity levels, possibly leading to occupant discomfort. There are discrepancies in the literature on occupant comfort as it relates to indoor humidity and recommended upper humidity limits. The choice of humidity limit could potentially change results and conclusions on the energy impacts of a new air conditioner or dehumidifier technology, changing ventilation rates, or an improved building envelope. In this study, we use building simulations to explore the impact of humidity control on cooling energy use in efficient residential buildings for different humidity limits. We look at limits based on humidity ratio (or dew point temperature), wet-bulb temperature, relative humidity, and constant slope lines based on the popular comfort models of both Fanger and Gagge. We quantify the additional energy use required to control humidity below these limits. We look at the sensitivity of the results to different temperature and humidity set points, occupant internal gains, moisture buffering levels, evaporator airflow rates, and dehumidifier energy factors. High-efficiency home predicted energy savings are more sensitive to the assumed humidity limit and cooling and dehumidification set points than the other parameters investigated in this paper.","Elsevier","","Oak Ridge National Lab.

The models used in previous optimization studies either omit the dynamic interaction between indoor airflow and HVAC or are too slow for model-based optimization. To address this limitation, we propose an optimization methodology using coupled simulation of the airflow and HVAC that captures the dynamics of both systems. We implement an optimization platform using the coupled models of a coarse grid Fast Fluid Dynamics model for indoor airflow and Modelica models for HVAC which is linked to the GenOpt optimization engine. Then, we demonstrate the new optimization platform by studying the optimal thermostat placement in a typical office room with a VAV terminal box in the design phase. After validating the model, we perform an optimization study, in which the VAV terminal box is dynamically controlled, and find that our optimization platform can determine the optimal location of thermostat to achieve either best thermal comfort or least energy consumption, or the combined. Finally, the time cost for performing such optimization study is about 6.2 h, which is acceptable in the design phase.","","","National Renewable Energy Lab.

Further, a latent travel pattern construct which captures a week-long number of trips by non-vehicle travel modes as well as daily vehicle and tollway use is estimated in a structural equation setting and subsequently fed into the NL model. Using a recent RP dataset from the California Household Travel Survey, we identify market segments for alternative fuel types based on households' socio-economic characteristics, built environment factors concerning public plug-in EV (PEV) charging infrastructure characteristics, latent and observable travel behavior factors of a household vehicle's principal driver, and vehicle attributes. The results highlight that the number of public PEV charging stations is only significant for households choosing PHEVs and interestingly insignificant in the BEV utility. Furthermore, the sensitivity analysis of the findings reveals that PHEV users are elastic with respect to household vehicle ownership ratio and the latent green travel pattern construct, while BEV users are inelastic to any explanatory variable.","Elsevier","","Argonne National Lab.

The control is based on monitoring the luminance distribution of the sky and real-time lighting computation for a building interior, using an embedded photometric device (EPD). It optimizes tint states of EC glazing to offer sufficient daylight provision and temper discomfort glare for occupants, which potentially mitigates excessive solar heat gain. ’In-situ’ experiments were conducted in a full-scale testbed to demonstrate the daylighting performance under various sky conditions.

Tri-reforming of such biogas (CH<sub>4</sub> + CO<sub>2</sub>) is a combination of dry reforming, steam reforming, and partial oxidation to produce syngas (CO + H<sub>2</sub>). This syngas can be converted to liquid hydrocarbons using Fischer–Tropsch Synthesis (FTS). A novel technology of combining tri-reforming and FTS (TriFTS) is proposed and utilized here to convert landfill gas (LFG) to high value added liquid hydrocarbon fuels such as gasoline, diesel, and jet fuel. This article explores the feasibility of TriFTS from an experimental and process economics point of view. Landfill gas collected from a local landfill was used in this study. After removing contaminant gases such as H<sub>2</sub>S and NH<sub>3</sub>via condensation and adsorption, NiMg/Ce<sub>0.6</sub>Zr<sub>0.4</sub>O<sub>2</sub> pellets were used in a tri-reforming reactor to produce H<sub>2</sub> and CO in a ratio suitable for FTS. The conversions of CH<sub>4</sub> and CO<sub>2</sub> were 99% and 60%, respectively. The H<sub>2</sub>/CO molar ratio was 1.7. In the FTS section, a Co/SiO<sub>2</sub> eggshell catalyst was used to synthesize liquid hydrocarbon with high selectivity for middle distillate cuts. The CO conversion in FTS was 71% and the liquid hydrocarbon product was similar to that of low sulfur diesel. The experimental results were used to conduct a preliminary economic analysis of a commercial scale TriFTS process. The results indicate that 45% of the energy contained in the LFG can be recovered in the liquid fuel generated, with the rest going to meet the energy demands of the conversion process including heat losses. The breakeven cost of diesel fuel produced was estimated as $3.24 per gal but reduces to 2.71 per gal if the LFG is assumed to be free of cost as would be the case for landfill operators. Additional renewable fuel credits will make the process even more economically attractive. This study suggests that conversion of LFG to liquid fuels is a promising new technology ripe for commercialization.","Royal Society of Chemistry","","T2C-Energy, LLC, Tampa, FL (United States)","USDOE Office of Science (SC); T2C-Energy, LLC (United States); Florida High Tech Corridor (United States)","","United States","2018-12-26T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: Sustainable Energy & Fuels; Journal Volume: 3; Journal Issue: 2","","Medium: ED; Size: p. 539-549","","","SC0015221","Journal ID: ISSN 2398-4902","10.1039/C8SE00344K","","2021-10-26T00:00:00Z","1492008","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/1492008","https://www.osti.gov/servlets/purl/1492008","Sustainable Energy & Fuels","2","3"
"A New Methodology for Calculating The Energy Performance of Manufacturing Facilities","Guo, Wei; Wenning, Thomas; Nimbalkar, Sachin U.; Thirumaran, Kiran; Armstrong, Kristina O.; Levine, Eli","32 ENERGY CONSERVATION, CONSUMPTION, AND UTILIZATION","Total energy comparison (TEC), classic energy intensity (CEI), and linear regression models (LRM) are the three most common approaches used to track the energy performance of manufacturing facilities. TEC simply compares the total energy consumption from utility bills. TEC is rarely used because it does not consider the variation of any factors that may affect energy consumption. One step better, CEI considers the variation of production rates by using the ratio of annual total energy consumption over annual total production. However, CEI fundamentally assumes that energy consumption is zero if the production rate is zero. This is almost never true and can cause significant errors. Using linear regression models, LRM considers the impact of multiple variables and, therefore, most accurately tracks energy performance. Unfortunately, because of the lack of either required data or technical expertise, some facilities cannot create valid linear regression models. For these cases, CEI is the only option. Here, the goal of this article is to develop a new methodology, modified energy intensity (MEI), which is more accurate than CEI, but requires much less data and is easier to implement than LRM. Using the underlying principle of LRM, this article first outlines the mathematical derivation of the equations for MEI, then explains them from an engineering perspective. Finally, the implementation of MEI is discussed.","Taylor & Francis","","Oak Ridge National Lab.

Consequently, packet drop and delay in VANETs can significantly impact ITS performance. Feedback-based eco-routing (FB-ECO) is a promising ITS technology, which is expected to reduce vehicle fuel/energy consumption and pollutant emissions by routing drivers through the most environmentally friendly routes. To compute these routes, the FB-ECO utilizes VANET communication to update link costs in real-time, based on the experiences of other vehicles in the system. In this paper, we study the impact of vehicular communication on FB-ECO navigation performance in a large-scale real network with realistic calibrated traffic demand data. We conduct this study at different market penetration rates and different congestion levels. We start by conducting a sensitivity analysis of the market penetration rate on the FB-ECO system performance, and its network-wide impacts considering ideal communication. Subsequently, we study the impact of the communication network on system performance for different market penetration levels, considering the communication system. Here, the results demonstrate that, for market penetration levels less than 30%, the eco-routing system performs adequately in both the ideal and realistic communication scenarios. It also shows that, for realistic communication, increasing the market penetration rate results in a network-wide degradation of the system performance.","MDPI AG","","Virginia Polytechnic Inst. and State Univ.

Additionally, a case study with water heaters demonstrates that this schedule synthesis method can outperform traditional modelling strategies by replicating key characteristics of a measured equipment load profile, including its magnitude, variability, and relationships between load and time. In particular, the new method was more effective at replicating the total water heater electrical load duration curve and ramp duration curve of a real-world reference building.","Taylor & Francis","","National Renewable Energy Lab.

Carbon capture, utilization and geological storage (CCUS) is a key approach to reduce the emissions of the anthropogenic CO<sub>2</sub> into the atmosphere. Of those, sequestering the CO<sub>2</sub> into depleted hydrocarbon reservoirs with associated enhanced oil recovery is the most achievable approach under current economic constraints since it increases recovery of existing oil reserves, and bridges the gap between nonprofit geological CO<sub>2</sub> sequestration and profit CO<sub>2</sub>-EOR. The Upper Devonian fluvial sandstone reservoir in Jacksonburg-Stringtown oil field in West Virginia, which has produced over 22 million barrels of oil since 1895, is an ideal candidate for CO<sub>2</sub> sequestration coupled with EOR. This research illustrates an example of CCUS, in which CO<sub>2</sub> is sequestered into underground meanwhile enhanced oil recovery from the depleted hydrocarbon reservoir by water alternating gas (WAG) strategy. Three CO<sub>2</sub> storage mechanisms including structural/stratigraphic trapping, dissolution trapping, and residual trapping are considered. A 3D geological model is constructed based on existing geological data from the Jacksonburg-Stringtown oil field. A 3D composition fluid model with 0.4 pore volume (PV) of water injection before WAG process is considered as a benchmark of this study. Several factors including WAG cycle period, injection time ratio, CO<sub>2</sub> injection rate are evaluated. After injection wells are completely shut-in, stored CO<sub>2</sub> is monitored for additional 200 years as a function of various storage mechanisms. The result shows that over 6 years of WAG injection, total 12 - 40 MMlb-mol CO<sub>2</sub> is sequestrated and oil recovery factor can achieve 28%. As a conclusion, this research constructs a basic workflow for CO<sub>2</sub> storage coupled with CO<sub>2</sub>-EOR which can be applied to other super-mature oil fields.","Elsevier","","West Virginia Univ., Morgantown, WV (United States)","USDOE","","United States","2019-02-01T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: Energy Procedia (Online); Journal Volume: 158","","Medium: ED; Size: p. 6079-6086","","","PI0000017","Journal ID: ISSN 1876-6102","10.1016/j.egypro.2019.01.507","","2023-02-03T00:00:00Z","1922060","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/1922060","https://www.osti.gov/servlets/purl/1922060","Energy Procedia (Online)","","158"

In this paper, we examine 13 refrigerants from the perspective of the characteristic shape of their respective temperature–entropy (T–S) and the logarithm of the pressure versus inverse absolute temperature (log P vs. T<sup>–1</sup>) saturated phase boundary. Such analyses explain why certain refrigerants possess a re-entrant characteristic while others do not. The re-entrant region is due to skewness of the saturation boundary. The cause of skewness is investigated for its importance in heat pump performance, design, and configuration. Re-entrant behavior contributes to premature mechanical wear of compressor components. Knowledge of the properties of the phase boundary on either side of the critical point, is useful for a better perspective on discriminating refrigerants, as hydrochlorofluorocarbons are phased out and replacement refrigerants must be found.

Sustainable manufacturing is gaining significant momentum: companies are not only improving their product quality, but also optimizing the production processes to improve energy consumption (i.e., minimizing energy cost) in order to manage environmental challenges which contribute to global climate change. The purpose of this paper is to study a preemptive scheduling problem on a single-machine to minimize the total completion time and total energy cost under time-of-use electricity tariffs, which is a mixed-integer multiobjective mathematical programming model. To solve these objectives, we develop several new holistic ant colony optimization algorithms. The proposed model is solved via several methods including weighted sum method (WSM) using CPLEX, and multiobjective ant colony optimization based on a dominance ranking (ACO-DR) or based on a dominance ranking procedure and crowding distance comparison (ACO-DRC) or based on a heuristic approach to obtain an approximate Pareto-front and also provide information on when to start and resume each job for any solution on the Pareto-front. We provide detailed experimental results evaluating the performance of the proposed algorithms. In a case study, we demonstrate how the results of the multiobjective model could be utilized in decision making using the multiobjective optimization on the basis of ratio analysis (MOORA) method. Furthermore, this proposed model and heuristics allows decision makers to operate in challenging-data enabled environments in industrial internet of things ecosystem, and assists in optimizing production planning to improve energy cost.","Elsevier","","Wichita State Univ., Wichita, KS (United States)","USDOE","","United States","2018-12-10T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: Computers and Industrial Engineering; Journal Volume: 127","","Medium: ED; Size: p. 240-252","","","EE0007719","Journal ID: ISSN 0360-8352","10.1016/j.cie.2018.12.020","","2022-06-27T00:00:00Z","1869448","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/1869448","https://www.osti.gov/servlets/purl/1869448","Computers and Industrial Engineering","","127"

Both centralized and distributed decision approaches were explored in past decades as a way to enable efficient transactive operations. However, online distributed stochastic transactive operation has been overlooked in the literature. To bridge gaps in the research, a bi-level distributed stochastic model predictive control framework was proposed to study the transactive operations of building clusters where a system-level agent is employed to coordinate multiple building agents at the subsystem level. The energy transaction is optimized by a marginal price-based particle swarm optimizer at the system level. Given the energy transaction decisions, each building can independently solve a scenario-based two-stage stochastic model to optimally dispatch the electricity and ancillary services for optimal energy performance. The effectiveness of the proposed framework and coordination algorithm are demonstrated in deterministic, stochastic, and online operations and compared to centralized decisions using several sets of experiments. Additionally, the proposed approach can realize autonomous transactive operation and be extended to community-level building clusters in a plug-and-play way.","Elsevier","","Oak Ridge National Lab.

"Cooling load forecasting-based predictive optimisation for chiller plants","Wang, Lan; Lee, Eric Ming; Yuen, Richard K. K.; Feng, Wei","32 ENERGY CONSERVATION, CONSUMPTION, AND UTILIZATION; Chiller plants; Predictive supervisory optimisation; Cooling load forecast; Energy efficiency","Extensive electric power is required to maintain indoor thermal comfort using heating, ventilation and air conditioning (HVAC) systems, of which, water-cooled chiller plants consume more than 50% of the total electric power. To improve energy efficiency, supervisory optimisation control can be adopted. The controlled variables are usually optimised according to instant building cooling load and ambient wet bulb air temperature at regular time intervals. In this way, the energy efficiency of chiller plants has been improved. However, with an inherent assumption that the instant building cooling load and ambient wet bulb temperature remain constant in the coming time interval, the energy efficiency potential has not been fully realised, especially when cooling loads vary suddenly and extremely. To solve this problem, a cooling load forecasting-based predictive optimisation method is proposed. Rather than minimising the instant system power according to the instant building cooling load and ambient wet bulb temperature, the controlled variables are derived to minimise the sum of the instant system power and one-time-step-ahead future system power according to both instant and forecasted future building cooling loads. With this method, the energy efficiency potential of a chiller plant can be further improved without shortening the operation time interval. 80% redundant energy consumption has been reduced for the sample chiller plant; energy can be saved for chiller plants that work for years. The evaluation on the effect of cooling load forecasting accuracy turns out that the more accurate the forecasts are, the more redundant energy consumption can be reduced.","Elsevier","","Lawrence Berkeley National Lab.

"Investigation of the combined efficiency of a solar/gas hybrid water heating system","Karki, Saroj; Haapala, Karl R.; Fronk, Brian M.","14 SOLAR ENERGY; 32 ENERGY CONSERVATION, CONSUMPTION, AND UTILIZATION; 42 ENGINEERING; Solar thermal; natural gas; water heating","In climate regions with large seasonal variations in solar radiation, such as the Pacific Northwest of the United States, a solar thermal energy collector might not economically satisfy year-round domestic water heating demands, requiring an auxiliary unit, such as a natural gas-fired water heater. Previous studies have shown that the burner efficiency of a gas-fired water heater varies depending on the log-mean temperature difference between the cold fluid (water) and the hot fluid (combustion gases). In a solar/gas hybrid water heating system where solar collectors are used in conjunction with a gas-fired heater, the partial heating of water provided by solar input reduces the log-mean temperature difference value for the gas heater, reducing the efficiency of the gas burner. Since this efficiency reduction varies depending on the amount of pre-heating provided by solar energy input, it is difficult to accurately predict the actual cost and energy savings offered by solar/gas hybrid water heaters in different climate scenarios. Hence, to predict the actual energy and cost savings under various design conditions, the performance of solar/gas hybrid systems must be better understood. The purpose of this work is to experimentally determine the thermal performance of a solar/gas water hybrid water heating system with a 6.44 m2 flat plate solar collector array and a 22.3 kW natural gas burner in Corvallis, Oregon. Under different temperature lifts and solar insolation values, the system was operated at three different modes of heating: solar, gas, and combined solar/gas mode. The overall system thermal efficiency value for each mode is calculated. The efficiency of the solar collector heating system was found to be 41.97%, 39.82%, and 35.05% at initial water temperature of 20, 30, and 51.5 °C, respectively. For initial water temperatures of 20, 30, and 51.5 °C, the efficiency of the gas burner was found to be 69.2%, 66.4%, and 65.5% at the HHV, and 76.7%, 73.6%, and 72.6% at the LHV of natural gas, respectively. In the combined solar/gas heating mode, the efficiency of the gas burner decreased with increasing solar fraction. For solar fractions of 4.93%, 9.40%, 11.39%, and 14.27%, the efficiency of the gas burner in terms of the HHV of natural gas was found to be of 69.08%, 66.80%, 66.17%, and 65.18%, respectively. Based on the experimental results, a configuration that would provide higher overall system efficiency for combined solar/gas heating is suggested.","Elsevier","","Oregon State Univ., Corvallis, OR (United States)","USDOE Office of Energy Efficiency and Renewable Energy (EERE), Energy Efficiency Office.

We show how to leverage a decentralized authorization syndication platform to extend the design of building operating systems beyond the single administrative domain of a building. The authorization system leveraged is based on blockchain smart contracts to permit decentralized and democratized delegation of authorization without central trust. Upon this, a publish/subscribe syndication tier and a containerized service execution environment are constructed. Combined, these mechanisms solve problems of delegation, federation, device protection and service execution that arise throughout the built environment.

Researchers investigated the possibility of integrating energy management systems with cyber-physical systems to form energy-cyber-physical systems in order to promote building energy management. However, minimizing energy consumption while fulfilling building functions for energy-cyber-physical systems is challenging due to the dynamics of building occupants. As occupant behavior is a major source of uncertainty for energy management, ignoring it often results in both energy waste caused by overheating and overcooling as well as discomfort due to insufficient thermal and ventilation services. To mitigate such uncertainties, this study proposes an occupancy-linked energy-cyber-physical system that incorporates WiFi probe-based occupancy detection. The proposed framework utilizes ensemble classification algorithms to extract three forms of occupancy information. It creates a data interface to link energy management systems and cyber-physical systems and allows for automated occupancy detection and interpretation by assembling multiple weak classifiers for WiFi signals. A validation experiment in a large office room was conducted to examine the performance of the proposed occupancy-linked energy-cyber-physical systems. The experiment and simulation results suggest that, with a proper classifier and occupancy data type, the proposed model can potentially save about 26.4% of energy consumption in cooling and ventilation demands.","Elsevier","","Lawrence Berkeley National Lab.

In this work, we demonstrate that the first-order magneto-structural transition temperature for a given composition is tunable over a wide temperature range through heat treatment and hydrostatic pressure. The first-order transition temperature was reduced by over 100 K as the annealing temperature went from 600 to 900 °C, and this first-order transition was converted to second order when the sample was annealed at 1000 °C. The maximum magnetic-induced isothermal entropy change with μ0ΔH=7 T reaches -58 J/kg K for the sample annealed at 600 °C, and the relative cooling power reaches 558 J/kg for the sample annealed at 700 °C. Similar to the influence of annealing temperatures, the first-order martensitic transition temperatures were reduced as the application of hydrostatic pressure increased until they were converted to second order.

"<em>Buildings.Occupants</em>: A Modelica package for modelling occupant behaviour in buildings","Wang, Zhe; Hong, Tianzhen; Jia, Ruoxi","32 ENERGY CONSERVATION, CONSUMPTION, AND UTILIZATION; Occupant behaviour; Modelica; Modelica Buildings Library; Modelica Occupants Package; Occupant behaviour modelling","Energy-related occupant behaviour is crucial to design and operation of energy and control systems in buildings. Occupant behaviours are often oversimplified as static schedules or settings in building performance simulation ignoring their stochastic nature. The continuous and dynamic interaction between occupants and building systems motivates their simultaneous simulation in an efficient manner. In the past, simultaneous simulation has relied on co-simulation approaches or customized source code changes to building simulation programmes. This paper presents Buildings. Occupants, an open-source package implemented in Modelica, for the simulation of occupant behaviours of lighting, windows, blinds, heating and air conditioning systems in office and residential buildings. Examples were presented to illustrate how the models in the Occupants package are capable to simulate stochastic occupant behaviours. Furthermore, the major contribution of this work is to introduce the equation-based modelling approach to simulate occupant behaviours in buildings and to develop an open-source Occupants package in the Modelica language.","Taylor & Francis","","Lawrence Berkeley National Lab.

"Predicting plug loads with occupant count data through a deep learning approach","Wang, Zhe; Hong, Tianzhen; Piette, Mary Ann","32 ENERGY CONSERVATION, CONSUMPTION, AND UTILIZATION; 97 MATHEMATICS AND COMPUTING; Plug loads; Prediction; Predictive control; Long Short Term Memory Network; Occupant count; Deep learning","Predictive control has gained increasing attention for its ability to reduce energy consumption and improve occupant comfort in buildings. The plug loads prediction is a key component for the predictive building controls, as plug loads is a major source of internal heat gains in buildings. This study proposed a novel method to apply the Long-Short-Term-Memory (LSTM) Network, a special form of Recurrent Neural Network, to predict plug loads. The occupant count and the time have been confirmed to drive the plug load profile and thus selected as the features for the plug load prediction. The LSTM network was trained and tested with ground truth occupant count data collected from a real office building in Berkeley, California. Results from the LSTM network markedly improve the prediction accuracy compared with traditional linear regression methods and the classical Artificial Neural Network. 95% of 1-hour predictions from LSTM network are within ±1 kW of the actual plug loads, given the average plug loads during the office hour is 8.6 kW. The CV(RMSE) of the predicted plug load is 11% for the next hour, and 20% for the next eight hours. Lastly, we compared four prediction approaches with the office building we monitored: LSTM vs. ARIMA, with occupant counts vs. without occupant counts. It was found, the prediction error of the LSTM approach is around 4% less than the ARIMA approach. Using occupant counts as an exogenous input could further reduce the prediction error by 5%-6%. The findings of this paper could shed light on the plug load prediction for building control optimizations such as model-predictive control.","Elsevier","","Lawrence Berkeley National Lab.

"A Simplified Methodology to Estimate Energy Savings in Commercial Buildings from Improvements in Airtightness","Bhandari, Mahabir S.; Hun, Diana E.; Shrestha, Som S.; Pallin, Simon B.; Lapsa, Melissa Voss","32 ENERGY CONSERVATION, CONSUMPTION, AND UTILIZATION; air leakage; infiltration; airtightness; commercial prototype buildings; energy savings; retrofits; EnergyPlus; stand-alone retail building","<p>Air leakage through the envelope of commercial buildings in the United States accounts for approximately 6% of their energy use. Various simulation approaches have been proposed to estimate the impact of air leakage on building energy use. Although approaches that are based on detailed airflow modeling appear to be the most accurate to calculate infiltration heat transfer in simulation models, these approaches tend to require significant modeling expertise and effort. To make these energy savings estimates more readily available to building owners and designers, Oak Ridge National Laboratory, the National Institute of Standards and Technology, the Air Barrier Association of America, and the US Department of Energy (DOE) are developing a user-friendly online calculator that applies a detailed airflow modeling approach to examine energy savings due to airtightness in commercial buildings. The calculator, however, is limited to 52 US cities and a few cities in Canada and China. This paper describes the development of an alternative, simplified method to estimate energy savings from improved airtightness. The proposed method uses the same detailed approach for hourly infiltration calculations as the online calculator but it expands the ability to estimate energy savings to all US cities using hourly outdoor air temperature as the only input. The new simple regression model-based approach was developed and tested with DOE’s standalone retail prototype building model. Results from the new approach and the calculator show good agreement. In addition, a simple approach to estimate percent energy savings for retrofitted buildings was also developed; results were within 5% of the energy saving estimates from the online calculator.</p>","MDPI AG","","Oak Ridge National Lab.

Development of a city-scale dataset of the existing building stock is a critical step of UBEM to automatically generate energy models of urban buildings and simulate their performance. This study introduces data needs, data standards, and data sources to develop city building datasets for UBEM. First, a literature review of data needs for UBEM was conducted. Then, the capabilities of the current data standards for city building datasets were reviewed. Moreover, the existing public data sources from several pioneer cites were studied to evaluate whether they are adequate to support UBEM. The results show that most cities have adequate public data to support UBEM; however, the data are represented in different formats without standardization, and there is a lack of common keys to make the data mapping easier. Finally, a case study is presented to integrate the diverse data sources from multiple city departments of San Francisco. The data mapping process is introduced and discussed. It is recommended to use the unique building identifiers as the common keys in the data sources to simplify the data mapping process. Furthermore, the integration methods and workflow are applied to other U.S. cities for developing the city-scale datasets of their existing building stock, including San Jose, Los Angeles, and Boston.","Elsevier","","Lawrence Berkeley National Lab.

"Occupant comfort and behavior: High-resolution data from a 6-month field study of personal comfort systems with 37 real office workers","Kim, Joyce; Bauman, Fred; Raftery, Paul; Arens, Edward; Zhang, Hui; Fierro, Gabe; Andersen, Michael; Culler, David","32 ENERGY CONSERVATION, CONSUMPTION, AND UTILIZATION; thermal comfort; occupant behavior; personal comfort system; Internet of Things; big data","Personal Comfort Systems (PCS) provide individual occupants local heating and cooling to meet their comfort needs without affecting others in the same space. It saves energy by relaxing ambient temperature requirements for the HVAC system. Aside from these benefits, PCS offers a wealth of data that can describe how individuals interact with heating/cooling devices in their own environment. Recently developed Internet-connected PCS chairs have unlocked this opportunity by generating continuous streams of heating and cooling usage data, along with occupancy status and environmental measurements via embedded sensors. The data allow individuals' comfort and behavior to be learned, and can inform centralized systems to provide ‘just the right’ amount of conditioning to meet occupant needs. In summer 2016, we carried out a study with PCS chairs involving 37 occupants in an office building in California. During the study period, we collected >5 million chair usage data-points and 4500 occupant survey responses, as well as continuous measurements of environmental and HVAC system conditions. The data analysis shows that (1) local temperatures experienced by individual occupants vary quite widely across different parts of the building, even within the same thermal zone; (2) occupants often have different thermal preferences even under the same thermal conditions; (3) PCS control behavior can dynamically describe individuals' thermal preferences; (4) PCS chairs produce much higher comfort satisfaction (96%) than typically achieved in buildings. We conclude that PCS not only provide personalized comfort solutions but also offer individualized feedback that can improve comfort analytics and control decisions in buildings.","Elsevier","","Univ. of California, Berkeley, CA (United States)","USDOE Advanced Research Projects Agency - Energy (ARPA-E)","","United States","2018-11-17T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: Building and Environment; Journal Volume: 148","","Medium: ED; Size: p. 348-360","","","AR0000529","Journal ID: ISSN 0360-1323; PII: S0360132318307078","10.1016/j.buildenv.2018.11.012","","2022-04-20T00:00:00Z","1613636","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/1613636","https://www.osti.gov/servlets/purl/1613636","Building and Environment","","148"

"Inferring occupant counts from Wi-Fi data in buildings through machine learning","Wang, Zhe; Hong, Tianzhen; Piette, Mary Ann; Pritoni, Marco","32 ENERGY CONSERVATION, CONSUMPTION, AND UTILIZATION; 97 MATHEMATICS AND COMPUTING","An important approach to curtail building energy consumption is to optimize building control based on occupancy information. Various studies proposed to estimate occupant counts through different approaches and sensors. However, high cost and privacy concerns remain as major barriers, restricting the practice of occupant count detection. In this study, we propose a novel method utilizing data from widely deployed Wi-Fi infrastructure to infer occupant counts through machine learning. Compared with the current indirect measurement methods, our method improves the performance of estimating people count: (1) we avoid privacy concerns by anonymizing and reshuffling the MAC addresses on a daily basis; (2) we adopted a heuristic feature engineer approach to cluster connected devices into different types based on their daily connection duration. We tested the method in an office building located in California. In an area with an average occupancy of 22–27 people and a peak occupancy of 48 - 74 people, the root square mean error on the test set is less than four people. The error is within two people counts for more than 70% of estimations, and less than six counts for more than 90% of estimations, indicating a relatively high accuracy. The major contribution of this study is proposing a novel and accurate approach to detect occupant counts in a non-intrusive way, i.e., utilizing existing Wi-Fi infrastructure in buildings without requiring the installation of extra hardware or sensors. The method we proposed is generic and could be applied to other commercial buildings to infer occupant counts for energy efficient building control.","Elsevier","","Lawrence Berkeley National Lab.

These disparities reflect both technical and economic factors, as well as the social, political, and ecological gaps between how communities see energy development and national/global policy goals. Known as the “local-national gap”, many nations struggle with fostering meaningful conversations about the role of alternative energy technologies within communities. Mitigation of this problem first requires understanding the distribution of existing alternative energy technologies at the local level of policymaking. To address the limitation of existing adoption trend analysis at the scale of local governance (e.g., county governments), this paper demonstrates a novel method for contextualizing solar technology adoption by using the State of Georgia in the United States as an exemplar. Leveraging existing work on the Gini Coefficient as a metric for measuring energy inequity, we argue these tools can be applied to analyze where gaps exist in ongoing solar adoption trends. As we demonstrate, communities that adopt solar tend to be concentrated in a few counties, indicating existing conversations are limited to a circumscribed set of social networks. This information and the model we demonstrate can enable focused qualitative analyses of existing solar trends, not only among high-adoption areas but within communities where little to no adoption has occurred.","MDPI","","Univ. of Georgia, Athens, GA (United States)","USDOE Office of Energy Efficiency and Renewable Energy (EERE), Renewable Power Office.

This case study evaluates the performance of the traditional courtyard design of the Jiangnan Museum, located in Jiangsu Province. In the evaluation, the spatial layout of courtyards is adjusted, the aspect ratio is changed, and an ecological buffer space is created. To model and evaluate the performance of the courtyard design, this study applied the Computational fluid dynamics (CFD) software, Parabolic Hyperbolic Or Elliptic Numerical Integration Code Series (PHOENICS), for wind environment simulation, and the EnergyPlus-based software, DesignBuilder, for energy simulation. Results show that a good combination of courtyard layout and aspect ratio can improve the use of natural ventilation by increasing free cooling during hot summers and reducing cold wind in winters. The results also show that ecological buffer areas of a courtyard can reduce cooling loads in summer by approximately 19.6% and heating loads in winter by approximately 22.3%. The study provides insights into the optimal design of a courtyard to maximize its benefit in regulating the microclimate during both winter and summer.","MDPI","","Lawrence Berkeley National Lab.

"Transient and thermo-economic analysis of MED-MVC desalination system","Elsayed, Mohamed L.; Mesalhy, Osama; Mohammed, Ramy H.; Chow, Louis C.","32 ENERGY CONSERVATION, CONSUMPTION, AND UTILIZATION; Seawater; Cost diagram; Mechanical vapor compression (MVC); Dynamic disturbance","An exergo-economic model is used to assess the performance of a multi-effect desalination plant integrated to a mechanical vapor compressor unit (MED-MVC) with a water production capacity of 1500 $m^3$/day. The results show that the second law efficiency ($\eta_{II}$) 2.8%. The MVC and evaporator units are responsible for about 39 and 52% of the total exergy destruction, respectively. The total water price (TWP) is 1.70 $\$/m^3$ when calculated using a simple conventional economic model and 1.63 $\$/m^3$ when calculated using an exergy-based cost model. Increasing the number of effects from 1 to 6 results in a 39% reduction in the specific power consumption (SPC), a 70% increase in $\eta_{II}$ and a 24% decrease in TWP. A dynamic model is developed to investigate the effect of fluctuations of compressor work ($\dot{W}_c$) and inlet seawater temperature ($T_{sw}$) on the plant behavior and performance. The dynamic model results show that the disturbance in $\dot{W}$ has a significant effect on the plant transient behavior and may cause the plant to cease operation while a disturbance in $T_{sw}$ has only a moderate impact. Increasing $T_{sw}$ above a certain value of the steady-state condition without proper control on the plant response could lead to evaporator dry out. In term of performance, a reduction in $\dot{W}_c$ causes a decrease in the plant production capacity and SPC, while it increases the plant performance ratio (PR). On the other hand, a reduction in the inlet $T_{sw}$ causes a reduction in the plant production capacity and PR and an increase in SPC for the same compressor work. Furthermore, a comparison between a MED-MVC system and a MED integrated to a thermal vapor compressor system (MED-TVC) reveals that the latter system is rather sensitive to the reduction in $T_{sw}$ due to the presence of the condenser unit in the MED-TVC. The response of the MED-MVC system is slower than the MED-TVC which is due to the high thermal capacity of the preheaters for the feed in the MED-MVC.","Elsevier","","Savengy Technologies, LLC, Orlando, FL (United States)","USDOE Office of Science (SC); Egyptian Ministry of Research and Higher Education","","United States","2018-10-29T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: Energy (Oxford); Journal Volume: 167; Journal Issue: C","","Medium: ED; Size: p. 283-296","","","SC0015809","Journal ID: ISSN 0360-5442","10.1016/j.energy.2018.10.145","","2021-08-02T00:00:00Z","1593985","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/1593985","https://www.osti.gov/servlets/purl/1593985","Energy (Oxford)","C","167"
"A real-time vehicle-specific eco-routing model for on-board navigation applications capturing transient vehicle behavior","Wang, Jinghui; Elbery, Ahmed; Rakha, Hesham A.","32 ENERGY CONSERVATION, CONSUMPTION, AND UTILIZATION; 54 ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCES; 42 ENGINEERING; 97 MATHEMATICS AND COMPUTING; Eco-routing, Microscopic Simulation, Real-time On-board Navigation, Intelligent Transportation Systems, Connected Vehicles, Energy Consumption, Greenhouse Gas Emissions, Route Choice","The paper develops a real-time vehicle-specific eco-routing model for use in on-board navigation systems for both conventional fuel- and battery-powered electric vehicles. The model uses a novel link cost function that retains all microscopic transient behavior along a link by capturing within-link speed, acceleration, and road grade variations. Specifically, eight vehicle-agnostic link-specific variables are transmitted to the cloud and fused with information received from other connected vehicles. The fused data are then sent back to the connected vehicles and used to compute vehicle-specific eco-routes (edge computing). The solution produces an energy-efficient dynamic user-equilibrium traffic assignment that is solved incrementally. A numerical experiment is first designed to test the model, demonstrating the benefits associated with vehicle-specific eco-routes compared to those produced by traditional models. The model is then implemented in a micro-simulation framework to evaluate the network-wide impacts of the proposed energy-efficient user-optimum incremental traffic assignment for different traffic demand levels. Results demonstrate that the proposed model produces lower network-wide energy consumption levels compared to traditional energy-efficient and travel time user-optimum traffic assignment methods for both conventional fuel and electric vehicles. Conventional fuel savings relative to travel time routing decrease with increasing traffic demand levels, while electric power savings do not vary monotonically with congestion levels. Energy savings relative to traditional eco-routing are also demonstrated to not vary monotonically with demand levels. Results of the study also demonstrate that the transportation network layout significantly affects the eco-routing system performance. Finally, the feasibility of the proposed model in real-world applications is discussed and presented.","Elsevier","","Virginia Polytechnic Inst. and State Univ.

"Thermal performance and potential annual energy impact of retrofit thin-glass triple-pane glazing in US residential buildings","Hart, Robert; Selkowitz, Stephen; Curcija, Charlie","32 ENERGY CONSERVATION, CONSUMPTION, AND UTILIZATION","Heat transfer through the building envelope and associated air leakage comprise the largest HVAC loads in most climates, and windows, which are known as the weakest link in the thermal envelope, are responsible for about 5 Quads, or approximately 10%, of building energy use. Therefore, windows offer a significant opportunity for building energy savings. High performance windows, such as triple glazing, though comprised of less than 2% of all US window sales in 2016 and has remained stagnant because they typically require a full and expensive redesign of the typical window sash and frame. One potential low incremental cost solution to kick start the market is upgrading the glazing with a thin-glass triple-pane design that does not require modifications to existing frame and sash. Here in this work, we first define the characteristics and performance of current “typical” residential windows through an examination of the National Fenestration Rating Council (NFRC) Certified Products Directory (CPD). With knowledge of the typical window, we determine the potential thermal performance impact of replacing typical glazing with thin-glass triple-pane glazing. Finally, with an understanding of the potential improvements to traditional performance metrics, such as U-factor, we show the energy savings potential of the thin-triple glazing in place of typical low-e windows in residential buildings is 16% in heating dominated climates such as Minneapolis, MN, 12% in mixed climates such as Washington DC, and 7% in cooling dominated climates such as Houston, TX.","Springer","","Lawrence Berkeley National Lab.

Conservation measures, such as purchasing land to prevent development, can preserve stored aboveground C. Furthermore, since it is difficult to know what would happen to the land in the absence of conservation interventions, the additional carbon benefit of these programs remains unknown. Therefore, we analyzed 73 coastal parcels (292,184 total acres) acquired by the California State Coastal Conservancy (SCC) and developed counterfactual scenarios to highlight the impact of conservation actions. We found that an additional 55 * 10<sup>3</sup> Mg aboveground C (1.357% of the total stored carbon) was protected. The methodology we develop here, which incorporates expert opinion and neighboring land conversion trends, effectively evaluates the impact of conservation purchases to prevent land conversion, and could be used to measure changes of various ecosystem services.","Taylor & Francis","","Lawrence Berkeley National Lab.

"An Open Source Modeling Framework for Interdependent Energy-Transportation-Communication Infrastructure in Smart and Connected Communities","Lu, Xing; Hinkelman, Kathryn; Fu, Yangyang; Wang, Jing; Zuo, Wangda; Zhang, Qianqian; Saad, Walid","32 ENERGY CONSERVATION, CONSUMPTION, AND UTILIZATION; communities; interconnected systems; modelica; modeling; multi-infrastructure systems; object oriented methods; open source software","Infrastructure in future smart and connected communities is envisioned as an aggregate of public services, including energy, transportation, and communication systems, all intertwined with each other. The intrinsic interdependency among these systems may exert the underlying influence on both design and operation of the heterogeneous infrastructures. Yet, few prior studies have tapped into the interdependency among these systems in order to quantify their potential impacts during standard operation. In response to this, this paper proposes an open-source, flexible, integrated modeling framework suitable for designing coupled energy, transportation, and communication systems and for assessing the impact of their interdependencies. First, a novel multi-level, multi-layer, multi-agent approach is proposed to enable flexible modeling of the interconnected systems. Then, for the framework's proof of concept, preliminary component and system-level models for different systems are designed and implemented using Modelica, an equation-based object-oriented modeling language. Finally, three case studies of gradually increasing complexity are presented (energy, energy + transportation, and energy + transportation + communication) to evaluate the interdependencies among the three systems. Quantitative analyses show that the deviation of the average velocity on the road can be 10.5% and the deviation of the power drawn from the grid can be 7% with or without considering the transportation and communication system at the peak commute time, indicating the presence of notable interdependencies. The proposed modeling framework also has the potential to be further extended for various modeling purposes and use cases, such as dynamic modeling and optimization, resilience analysis, and integrated decision making in future connected communities.","IEEE","","National Renewable Energy Lab.

The structural material, which also offers some insulation qualities, is referred to as aerated slurry-infiltrated mesh. The insulation materials used in this building are based on biomass; the alternatives considered here include ground wood, shredded straw, and cellulose. Thermal conductivity tests were performed on aerated slurries of different bulk densities, and on the biomass-based insulation materials, some of which were prepared with different bulk densities. The competitive merits of the biomass-based indigenous insulation materials were assessed. The correlations between bulk density and thermal conductivity were evaluated and rationalized based on the prevalent mechanisms of heat transfer in different materials. The effects of temperature on the thermal conductivity of different biomass-based indigenous insulation materials were investigated. For wall insulation, a cost analysis was conducted in order to select the optimum insulation level. As a result, the thermal mass of the aerated slurry-infiltrated mesh building system was found to favor its energy-efficiency when compared with a similar wood building.","Elsevier","","Oak Ridge National Lab.

The Darwin model is a subset of Maxwell's equation in which the electromagnetic mode (light wave) has been analytically removed. This renders the Darwin formulation elliptic, instead of hyperbolic. Historically, Darwin-PIC practitioners have had difficulty implementing a well-posed set of boundary conditions for realistic applications. In this study, we demonstrate the well-posedness and effectiveness of a simple boundary-condition prescription for perfect conductors of specified potential and of arbitrary shape in multiple dimensions, using a recently developed conservative, implicit Darwin-PIC algorithm. The boundary conditions conserve the electromagnetic energy, and preserve the Coulomb gauge of the vector potential, <math><mi mathvariant=""normal"" is=""true"">∇</mi><mo is=""true"">·</mo><mi mathvariant=""bold"" is=""true"">A</mi><mo is=""true"">=</mo><mn is=""true"">0</mn></math> exactly.

"Integrating diagnostics and model-based optimization","Granderson, Jessica; Lin, Guanjing; Blum, David; Page, Janie; Spears, Michael; Piette, Mary Ann","32 ENERGY CONSERVATION, CONSUMPTION, AND UTILIZATION","Energy Management and Information Systems are a family of analytics technologies that include energy information systems, fault detection and diagnostics (FDD), and automated system optimization tools. Such systems have the potential to enable buildings to meet energy management goals of reducing total energy consumption and cost. Most current market offerings use data-driven and rule-based analytics. However, the use of physics-based models in the analytics offers potential improvements by providing an accurate estimation of outputs based on representation of the physical principles governing the building system behaviors. This also permits the use of design stage models to inform commissioning and operation. This paper describes the development and testing of a hybrid data-driven and physics model-based operational tool for energy efficiency in central cooling plants. The tool offers FDD functionality, setpoint optimization, and visualization of key performance parameters. It was demonstrated at a university campus in the mixed-humid ASHRAE Climate Zone 4A. Key performance metrics that were analyzed include plant electricity use reduction, plant model calibration, and system economics. Annual simulations indicate the tool can provide electricity savings of greater than 10% for approximately six months of the year, mainly during the winter season when wet bulb temperatures are low, though only 1.38% savings for the entire year. Additionally, over a 4-day period in April, recommended optimal setpoints were implemented, resulting in 17% savings versus metered baseline consumption. With respect to model calibration, the difference between model-predicted and measured parameters was less than 10% for 90% of data points acquired for three of six chillers, and for each ten cooling towers. Finally, the tool users reported that satisfaction with the capabilities was equal to or better than that with the preexisting BAS system.","Elsevier","","Lawrence Berkeley National Lab.

"Analysis of the Effect of Vehicle Platooning on the Optimal Control of a Heavy Duty Engine Thermal System","Block, Brian; Huynh, Brian; Boyle, Stephen; Stockar, Stephanie; Geyer, Stephen; Li, Jian; Huber, Jeffrey","32 ENERGY CONSERVATION, CONSUMPTION, AND UTILIZATION; 42 ENGINEERING","One promising method for reducing fuel consumption and emissions, particularly in heavy duty trucks, is platooning. As the distance between vehicles decreases, the following vehicles will experience less aerodynamic drag on the front of the vehicle. However, reducing the velocity of the air contacting the front of the vehicle could have adverse effects on the temperature of the engine. To compensate for this effect, the energy consumption of the engine cooling system might increase, ultimately limiting the overall improvements obtained with platooning. Understanding the coupling between drag reduction and engine cooling load requirement is key for successfully implementing platooning strategies. Additionally, in a Connected and Automated Vehicle (CAV) environment, where information of the future engine load becomes available, the operation of the cooling system can be optimized in order to achieve the maximum fuel consumption reduction. In this paper, a control-oriented physics-based model for the engine cooling loop of a Volvo engine is developed and validated against road data. Starting from the validated model, an optimal control problem for the coolant system is formulated considering the tradeoff between the tracking of the engine temperature setpoint and the corresponding fuel consumption under different trailing distances. To compare the coolant system performance, Dynamic Programming (DP) is used to determine the global optimal solution for the coolant system actuator. The coupling between optimal cooling system operation and reduction in ram air are evaluated by comparing the results obtained from the DP under different platooning conditions against the unrestricted scenario. In addition, the paper analyzes the changes in the tradeoff between fuel consumption and setpoint tracking for different vehicle distances. This analysis will provide useful insight on the sensitivity of the coolant system controller calibration to the platoon distance.","SAE International","","The Ohio State Univ., Columbus, OH (United States)","USDOE Advanced Research Projects Agency - Energy (ARPA-E)","","United States","2019-04-02T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: Society of Automotive Engineers Technical Paper Series; Journal Volume: 1; Conference: SAE WCX 2019, Detroit, MI., April 9-11","","Medium: ED","","","AR0000801","Journal ID: ISSN 0148-7191","10.4271/2019-01-1259","","2020-04-02T00:00:00Z","1559270","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/1559270","https://www.osti.gov/servlets/purl/1559270","Society of Automotive Engineers Technical Paper Series","","1"

The pack level energy density, specific energy, and battery cost are calculated using the spreadsheet tool BatPaC. The tool used experimental data for some cathode materials such as the lithiated oxides of nickel manganese cobalt (NMC), nickel cobalt aluminum (NCA), layered lithium- and manganese-rich nickel manganese cobalt (LMRNMC). The half-cell data were obtained at UCVs between 4.2 and 4.7 V vs. Li/Li<sup>+</sup>. The experimental data showed LMRNMC with the highest lithiation capacity gain, increasing from 176 mAh·g<sup>–1</sup> at 4.2 V to 260 mAh·g<sup>–1</sup> at 4.7 V; this advantage is partly offset by its lower average voltage. Assuming optimized cell materials/design and an area-specific impedance of 12 Ω•cm<sup>2</sup> for all the materials, the BatPaC results indicate that the specific energies or energy densities of the battery electric vehicle (BEV) and plug-in hybrid electric vehicle (PHEV) battery packs with the LMRNMC and NMC cathodes can exceed 180 (BEV) and 160 (PHEV) Wh·kg<sup>–1</sup> at UCV>4.6 V vs. Li/Li<sup>+</sup>.

"Evaluation of methods to assess the uncertainty in estimated energy savings","Touzani, Samir; Granderson, Jessica; Jump, David; Rebello, Derrick","32 ENERGY CONSERVATION, CONSUMPTION, AND UTILIZATION","In this work we present a methodology to evaluate the accuracy of methods used to quantify the uncertainty in estimated total energy savings. We focus on savings measurement and verification (M&V) approaches that use a baseline model to characterize energy use, and that forward-project the model for a counterfactual to determine avoided energy use. These approaches are common to the International Performance Measurement and Verification Protocol's (IPMVP's) Option C and Option B. This methodology can be used to evaluate the uncertainty in savings estimates that are due to model error. It has been applied to evaluate two uncertainty estimation methods, including the industry standard ASHRAE Guideline 14 approach. The evaluation used data from 69 commercial buildings and four different baseline models that span daily and hourly granularity, as well as linear and non-linear/non-parametric forms. The findings of this work indicate that the standard methods that are widely used by the M&amp;V community for estimating the total savings uncertainty over the post-installation period tend to underestimate the uncertainty. The tendency to underestimate the uncertainty is stronger for hourly models than for daily models, due to stronger autocorrelation in model residuals at the hourly time scale.","Elsevier","","Lawrence Berkeley National Lab.

Li-ion battery recycling streams pose a serious challenge to all existing recycling technologies due to their unknown and diverse chemistry. In this work, four representative recycling streams were used to demonstrate the flexibility of the recycling process developed at Worcester Polytechnic Institute (WPI) to accommodate a variable feed and generate consistent quality cathode material, LiNi<sub>1/3</sub>Mn<sub>1/3</sub>Co<sub>1/3</sub>O<sub>2</sub> (NMC111). Ni<sub>1/3</sub>Mn<sub>1/3</sub>CO<sub>1/3(</sub>OH)<sub>2</sub> precursors derived from four recycling streams were produced by a hydroxide co-precipitation method in a continuous stirred tank reactor. It took two days for the co-precipitation reaction to reach steady state. A possible evolution of the precursor particles up to the steady state was proposed. Both the precursors and cathodes from these four different recycling streams exhibit similar morphology, particle size distribution, and tap density. Moreover, these recovered cathode materials display similar electrochemical properties. Surprisingly these recovered NMC111s have better rate capability than a commercial NMC111 prepared from virgin materials. The different chemical compositions of the incoming recycling streams were shown to have little observed effect on the recovered precursor and resultant cathode material generated by the WPI-developed recycling process with advantages including no sorting, low temperature, and high quality recovered battery materials. Therefore, the WPI-developed process applies to different spent Li-ion battery waste streams and is therefore general.","American Chemical Society (ACS)","","Worcester Polytechnic Inst.

Accurate occupancy prediction is a key enabler for demand-based HVAC control so as to ensure HVAC is not run needlessly when when a room/zone is unoccupied. In this paper, we propose simple yet effective algorithms to predict occupancy alongside an algorithm for automatically assigning temperature set-points. Utilizing past occupancy observations, we introduce three different techniques for occupancy prediction. Firstly, we propose an identification-based approach, which identifies the model via Expectation Maximization (EM) algorithm. Secondly, we study a novel finite state automata (FSA) which can be reconstructed by a general systems problem solver (GSPS). Thirdly, we introduce an alternative stochastic model based on uncertain basis functions. The results show that all the proposed occupancy prediction techniques could achieve around 70% accuracy. Then, we have proposed a scheme to adaptively adjust the temperature set-points according to a novel temperature set algorithm with customers’ different discomfort tolerance indexes. By cooperating with the temperature set algorithm, our occupancy-based HVAC control shows 20% energy saving while still maintaining building comfort requirements.</p>","MDPI AG","","Oak Ridge National Lab.

"Opportunities for consumer-driven load shifting in commercial and industrial buildings","Rogers, Austin P.; Rasmussen, Bryan P.","32 ENERGY CONSERVATION, CONSUMPTION, AND UTILIZATION","Commercial and industrial buildings are typically billed for both electricity consumption and peak 15-minute demand. While this rate structure does not motivate consumers to lower the grid peak demand, it does provide strong motivation for shifting load away from the site peak. However, the economic viability of site peak reduction depends greatly on typical building operations and will vary widely from one building to the next. This paper quantifies the potential that various building types have for site peak reduction using a database of 15-minute demand for buildings in Texas. The primary contribution of this paper is the identification of building types that stand to gain the most by exploiting 15-minute peak demand charges. The influence that site peak demand reduction has on the overall grid is also analyzed. This analysis of site peak reduction in buildings leads to several interesting conclusions. For example, site peak reduction is generally most difficult at industrial and healthcare buildings. On the other hand, grade schools (K-12) and hotels may reduce the site peak with relatively little effort. However, even widespread site peak reduction will only have a minimal effect on the overall grid peak. While buildings may obtain cost savings by reducing these transmission and distribution costs, utilities should consider modifying the retail rate structure in order to provide a direct motivation for consumers to reduce wholesale electricity prices.","Elsevier","","Texas A & M Univ., College Station, TX (United States)","USDOE Office of Energy Efficiency and Renewable Energy (EERE), Energy Efficiency Office.

The study analyzed high-level plug loads across two office spaces, one using traditional laptops, the other using zero clients. In addition, the individual power consumption of four workstations was monitored and compared. Each workstation user switched between using a laptop or zero client for one week and then using the alternate system the second week. Results of the high-level and workstation analysis show that average workstation plug loads are lower for occupants using zero clients. However, this does not include power consumed by the data center managing VMs. This study calculates the affiliated data center power draw of VMs and shows that server-related loads push total zero-client computing energy higher than that of traditional laptops. Finally, a questionnaire was administered to building occupants to determine the appropriateness of zero-client computing for various user groups, with the results indicating that VMs are most appropriate for more basic software functions. The findings of this study suggest that advances in server technology can help improve both the overall efficiency and the usability of zero-client computing.","Taylor & Francis","","National Renewable Energy Lab.

"Vehicle energy consumption estimation using large scale simulations and machine learning methods","Yao, Junlin; Moawad, Ayman","32 ENERGY CONSERVATION, CONSUMPTION, AND UTILIZATION; Autonomie; CAFE; artificial neural networks; energy consumption estimation; machine learning; numerosity reduction; random sampling; vehicle simulation","Vehicle energy consumption and powertrain operations for future vehicle powertrain technologies are predicted through full-vehicle simulations using Autonomie, a simulation tool developed at Argonne National Laboratory. Over 1 million vehicles, with different powertrain types (conventional and numerous electrified powertrains) and component technologies (advanced engines, batteries, electrical machines, light weighting) are simulated for outputs including vehicle fuel economy and cost. Despite the ability of Autonomic to predict fuel economy given various combination of vehicle inputs, the full-vehicle simulation is very time-consuming. It takes approximately 84 h to simulate for 33,060 vehicles even using distributed computing on a cluster of 128 worker nodes. Moreover, Autonomic is unable to populate a continuous output space through simulation since it only yields outputs with discrete values instead of an input-output relation. This paper proposes a novel large-scale learning and prediction process (LSLPP) via machine learning approaches to answer the need for a continuous space of vehicle fuel economy and a more efficient simulation process. By learning in a supervised fashion to discover structures in data, the machine learning approaches seek to train a model that can explain the data with which we can perform prediction over unseen data. As such, we are able to accomplish analytic continuation on the current discrete space of simulation results. In addition, we present a random sampling -based numerosity reduction algorithm incorporated in LSLPP that reduces simulation runs and improves efficiency of data procurement. We analytically derive a theoretical bound in order to guarantee the effectiveness of our algorithm. We also compare random sampling to stratified sampling and suggest sampling strategies. A user-friendly tool is developed to support the process. Our experimental results confirm that the proposed LSLPP is able to greatly accelerate prediction and analysis of vehicle fuel economy. The output of this study is used by the US government to evaluate the impact of its R&D funding on energy security and CO<sub>2</sub> emission as well as for the setting of Corporate Average Fuel Economy (CAFE) standards.","Elsevier","","Argonne National Lab.

Process intensification provides the potential to reduce waste, improve energy efficiency, and potentially access new feedstocks – all areas that improve competiveness in industries such as chemical production, pulp & paper processing, fuels refining, and gas processing. In early 2017, the RAPID Manufacturing Institute was established as a partnership between the US Department of Energy and the American Institute of Chemical Engineers to drive the development and adoption of process intensification and the associated field of modular processing through energy intensive industries. Here, macroscopic drives that led to the establishment of RAPID are discussed as well as an overview of the technical structure of the institute.

One of these barriers is the energy consumption of seawater desalination. This paper reviews the existing energy requirements for membrane and thermal-based seawater desalination systems to produce potable water. Through literature review, it identifies the commercially-available option with the lowest energy intensity and the thermodynamic minimum energy requirement for each unit operation of the system. The paper then estimates the energy requirements to expand seawater desalination capacity to meet the potable water needs of water-stressed regions in the U.S. The results show that supplying 10% of the potable water demand for these regions located within 250 miles of a coastline using the lowest energy-intensity seawater desalination system commercially available would require &lt;0.1% of 2018 U.S. electricity consumption. This increases to approximately 0.5% if all public water for these same regions is supplied via desalinated seawater. Furthermore, these estimates of the energy implications of broader adoption provide an initial comparison to current U.S. electricity consumption.","Elsevier","","Lawrence Berkeley National Lab.

"Short-term Interventions for Long-term Change: Spreading Stable Green Norms in Networks","Spencer, Gwen; Carattini, Stefano; Howarth, Richard B.","32 ENERGY CONSERVATION, CONSUMPTION, AND UTILIZATION","Strong empirical evidence suggests that people infer prevailing pro-environmental norms based on the behavior of people they encounter and engage with. These norms seem to be adopted in response to both internal motivation and social pressure. To formalize such behavior, the economic literature has introduced theoretical models that include moral and social drivers. We complement this theoretical literature by analyzing the adoption of green behavior in presence of social networks. Leveraging insights from the network-science literature, we extend an existing model of socially contingent moral motivation to include characteristics of human social behavior that have been shown, empirically, to matter for green behavior, but which have been neglected by most theoretical models. Our network moral-motivation model leads naturally to spatial-heterogeneity in environmental norms. Consistent with non-network models, we show that temporary subsidy can lead to stable equilibria with positive adoption, even when the subsidy is discontinued. In our model, however, regulators can achieve significant savings by targeting subsidies. With our computational exercises, using small semi-realistic networks, we quantify the gains of targeting subsidies, or social interventions, towards optimal seed groups. These gains may be large compared to widespread subsidies, or random selection of seed groups, and depend on the society’s structural characteristics. Furthermore, considering social networks may change radically the performance of initiatives aimed at promoting the adoption of green behavior.","Now Publishers Inc.","","Yale Univ., New Haven, CT (United States)","USDOE Office of Energy Efficiency and Renewable Energy (EERE), Renewable Power Office","","United States","2019-02-26T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: Review of Behavioral Economics; Journal Volume: 6; Journal Issue: 1","","Medium: ED; Size: p. 53-93","","","EE0007657","Journal ID: ISSN 2326-6198; 2326-6201","10.1561/105.00000095","","2022-06-28T00:00:00Z","1648327","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/1648327","https://www.osti.gov/servlets/purl/1648327","Review of Behavioral Economics","1","6"

The presence of H<sub>2</sub>O clearly enhanced the CO<sub>2</sub> capture at T < 100 °C, compared to dry conditions, where the amount of CO<sub>2</sub> captured increased as a function of relative humidity. These improvements were attributed to NaHCO<sub>3</sub> and Na<sub>2</sub>CO<sub>3</sub> formation during carbonation.

We use first-principles-based nanoscopic simulations to investigate the intrinsic high-frequency dynamics of the electric-field-induced phase switching in such films which so far remains unknown. Here in this comprehensive study we report (i) the size and frequency evolution of the polarization response to the electric field;(ii)the intrinsic time for the phase switching; (iii) detailed comparison between the polarization reversal in the films with ferroelectric and antiferroelectric behavior; (iv) dynamics of the antiferroelectric and antiferrodistortive order parameters; (v) nanoscopic mechanism responsible for the phase switching. The nanoscopic insight leads to the prediction of the existence of two possible scenarios for the antipolar-polar phase switching depending on the mutual orientation of the antiferroelectric order parameter and the electric field. The two scenarios have different dynamical fingerprints. The polar-antipolar phase switching is found to be assisted by the formation of a nonpolar phase. Computational data indicate that the phase switching time is only fractions of nanoseconds for the polar-polar phase switching in ferroelectric films and polar-antipolar phase switching in antiferroelectric films. The antipolar-polar phase switching in antiferroelectric films is just a bit slower and takes the order of nanosecond.

"Potential benefits of cool walls on residential and commercial buildings across California and the United States: Conserving energy, saving money, and reducing emission of greenhouse gases and air pollutants","Rosado, Pablo J.; Levinson, Ronnen","32 ENERGY CONSERVATION, CONSUMPTION, AND UTILIZATION; Cool wall; Cool roof; Energy savings; Energy cost savings; Emission reduction; Solar reflectance; Albedo; Residential building; Commercial building","Solar-reflective “cool” walls reduce absorption of sunlight by the building envelope, which may decrease cooling load in warm weather and increase heating load in cool weather. Changes to annual heating, ventilation, and air conditioning (HVAC) energy use depend on climate, wall construction, wall orientation, building geometry, HVAC efficiency, and operating schedule. Changes to annual energy cost and energy-related emissions further vary with local energy prices and emission factors. In this work, we used EnergyPlus to perform over 100,000 whole-building energy simulations, spanning 10 different building categories, three building vintages, 16 California climate zones, and 15 United States (U.S.) climate zones. We find that cool walls yielded annual source energy, energy cost, and emission savings in all California climate zones and in warm U.S. (ASHRAE) climate zones. In California, annual whole-building HVAC energy cost savings were 4.0–27% in single-family homes, 0.5–3.8% in medium office buildings, and 0.0–8.5% in stand-alone retail stores. In warm U.S. climates—zones 1A (Miami, FL) through 4B (Albuquerque, NM)—annual HVAC energy cost savings were 1.8–8.3% in single-family homes, 0.3–4.6% in medium office buildings, and 0.5–11% in stand-alone retail stores. California and U.S. fractional source energy and emission savings were comparable to fractional energy cost savings. Per unit surface area modified, cool-wall savings often exceeded cool-roof savings because building codes typically prescribe much less wall insulation than roof insulation.","Elsevier","","Lawrence Berkeley National Lab.

"Agricultural demand response for decarbonizing the electricity grid","Aghajanzadeh, Arian; Therkelsen, Peter","29 ENERGY PLANNING, POLICY, AND ECONOMY; 32 ENERGY CONSERVATION, CONSUMPTION, AND UTILIZATION; Agriculture; Irrigation; Demand response; Ancillary services; Electricity; Water","Historically, the focus of the agricultural industry has been increasing profit through maximizing crop yield. Costs for energy and water are small compared to equipment and personnel, and are thus often overlooked. However, energy costs for irrigation are increasing and could be exacerbated with declining water levels in many Western states. This trend has motivated many farmers to explore sustainable irrigation water and energy management practices. Additionally, much of this new focus has been directed towards the adoption of new agricultural technologies with a misplaced assumption that technology alone will inherently bring all the benefits. On one hand, farms are going through a paradigm shift, and are turning into net electricity generators, and on the other, higher penetration of intermittent renewable sources into the electricity grid, require dynamic loads to help the grid balance its intra-hour variability and short duration ramps. The agricultural industry could be restructured to utilize larger amounts of renewable energy such as wind and solar and provide a great deal of flexibility to the grid. As emerging producers of clean energy, farmers are required to learn and speak the complex language of the electricity grid in order to monetize their energy generation while making the renewable electricity grid more resilient and reliable. In this paper, we develop a foundational approach for understanding and connecting three important concepts that can help the agricultural industry during this critical transition period. Those three concepts are: (a) current and future needs of the electricity grid, (b) available electricity market mechanisms through which farms can provide services to the grid, and (c) understanding electricity consuming/generating equipment on farms. Finally, defining these concepts and condensing them into a standardized framework, can remove a significant barrier for enabling farms to provide services to the electricity grid while improving their bottom line.","Elsevier","","Lawrence Berkeley National Lab.

"A multi-scale calibration approach for process-oriented aggregated building energy demand models","Taylor, Zachary Todd; Xie, YuLong; Burleyson, Casey D.; Voisin, Nathalie; Kraucunas, Ian P.","32 ENERGY CONSERVATION, CONSUMPTION, AND UTILIZATION; BEND; Buildings Modeling; climate change impacts; grid","Long-term energy planning relies largely on projections of future energy demand and hourly load profiles. Aggregate building models are increasingly being utilized to characterize the sensitivity of current and future building stocks to changes in climate, population, and building technology on city-to-regional-to-national scales. Due to challenges in the availability of data, those analyses have been limited to projection of energy demand at a single scale, usually state or country, while long-term planning power system models and production cost models might operate at different spatial scales such as energy regions which are focused on ensuring adequate generation infrastructure. In this work, we propose and evaluate a novel method to calibrate an aggregate building energy demand model (PNNL’s BEND model) against the best available data at the spatial scale of balancing authorities. This approach extends previous work on aggregated building energy demand by facilitating analysis of building energy demand across scales, in particular policy and operational decision-making scales. We show that the bias-corrected model estimates building electric loads reasonably well compared with estimates from a statistical model, but has the additional feature of flexibility across spatial scales. While the calibration approach is presently U.S.-centric and associated with U.S. energy regions, it can be extrapolated to other worldwide regions with similar scale challenges between policy and operational implementation decision making. We discuss the significant challenges involved in formulating and calibrating a complex physical model based on simulations of roughly 100,000 individual buildings against available aggregate regional electric load data and highlight areas for potential future work and improved data collection.","Elsevier","","Pacific Northwest National Lab.

"Data fusion in predicting internal heat gains for office buildings through a deep learning approach","Wang, Zhe; Hong, Tianzhen; Piette, Mary Ann","32 ENERGY CONSERVATION, CONSUMPTION, AND UTILIZATION; 42 ENGINEERING; Internal heat gains; Data fusion; Miscellaneous electric loads; Occupant count; Predictive control; Deep learning","Heating, Ventilation, and Air Conditioning (HVAC) is a major energy consumer in buildings. The predictive control has demonstrated a potential to reduce HVAC energy use. To facilitate predictive HVAC control, internal heat gains prediction is required. Here, we applied Long Short-Term Memory Networks, a special form of deep neural network, to predict miscellaneous electric loads, lighting loads, occupant counts and internal heat gains in two United States office buildings. Compared with the predetermined schedules used in American Society of Heating, Refrigerating and Air-Conditioning Engineers (ASHRAE) standard 90.1, the Long Short-Term Memory Networks method could reduce the prediction errors of internal heat gains from 12% to 8% in Building A, and from 26% to 16% in Building B. It was also found that for internal heat gains prediction, miscellaneous electric loads is a more important feature than occupant counts for two reasons. First, miscellaneous electric loads is the best proxy variable for internal heat gains, as it is the major component of and has the highest correlation coefficient with the internal heat gains. Second, miscellaneous electric loads contain valuable information to predict occupant count, while occupant count could not help improve miscellaneous electric loads prediction. Lastly, these findings could help researchers and practitioners select the most relevant features to more accurately predict internal heat gains for the implementation of predictive HVAC control in buildings.","Elsevier","","Lawrence Berkeley National Lab.

"Using facility-level emissions data to estimate the technical potential of alternative thermal sources to meet industrial heat demand","McMillan, Colin A.; Ruth, Mark","29 ENERGY PLANNING, POLICY, AND ECONOMY; 32 ENERGY CONSERVATION, CONSUMPTION, AND UTILIZATION; industry; manufacturing; process heating; thermal energy","Industry is frequently highlighted as the world's largest energy-using end-use sector. More specifically, the demand for heat drives much of the demand for energy and fossil fuels in the industrial sector. We conduct a top-down analysis to characterize historical energy and fossil fuel use in 14 top-GHG-emitting industries in the United States, their heat demand requirements, and the potential to substitute heat from geothermal, solar thermal (including concentrating technologies), and small modular nuclear reactors to meet these needs while reducing fossil-fuel use and greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions. We base this analysis on publicly-available facility-level GHG emissions and fuel-combustion data, in addition to assumed requirements for process temperature, to demonstrate the potential value to industry energy analysts of the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency's Greenhouse Gas Reporting Program data. We estimate on a county level that the adoption of these alternative heat sources could have reduced 2015 fossil-fuel use by approximately 31% and combustion GHG emissions by approximately 24%. The most extensive substitution opportunities are in the ethyl alcohol manufacturing and wet corn-milling industries; petroleum refining represents the largest absolute emissions mitigation potential. This initial top-down analysis of substitution potential does not consider more detailed technical factors, including resource availability that will influence the actual deployment of alternative energy technologies. The analysis also does not consider the economic or market factors, including the expected cost to build and operate these generators. We do assume process byproducts that are extensively used for combustion fuels would not be good candidates for substitution for alternative energy generators. Based on these caveats, our analysis could be considered a top-range estimate for this mix of heat generators and industry heat demands. Any subsequent analysis of these alternate energy sources should increase the level of technical, economic, and policy detail.","Elsevier","","National Renewable Energy Lab.

"Evolving Applications of Aerosol Sealant","Burkett, Helen W.","32 ENERGY CONSERVATION, CONSUMPTION, AND UTILIZATION; aerosol sealant; ducts; air sealing; residential buildings","Solving the issues facing the residential building industry today requires developing not only new technologies but also new, innovative applications of existing high-performance technologies. The U.S. Department of Energy's (DOE's) Building America Program is using this approach to develop a low-cost, easy solution for whole-home envelope air sealing. Aerosol sealant is a proven method for sealing ducts quickly and efficiently, especially in hard-to-reach places. This technology, originally developed at Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory in 1994 with support from DOE, seals 70%-90% of duct leaks (LBNL n.d.), saving $600-$850 per year in energy costs for an average household (DOE 2011). A new, innovative application takes this technology out of the duct system and into the conditioned space. Recent Building America projects have validated a method for whole-house air sealing using the aerosol sealant technology. With tighter envelope requirements in new codes and above-code programs, adequately air sealing by hand is more labor-intensive and costly than ever. The aerosol sealing method is designed to eliminate the guesswork and automate this process. The continuous measurement during installation allows builders to dial in the exact air tightness they need to meet their performance goals. Initial field testing shows that this method regularly achieves air leakage levels less than 1 ACH50 as measured by a blower door test. In a current Building America project, the Center for Energy and Environment is performing iterative field tests in 20 homes to identify the optimal integration and sequencing of this method in production home building processes to achieve a lower installation cost than traditional air sealing. This method has the potential to improve quality assurance of envelope sealing and significantly reduce labor costs compared with traditional air sealing approaches.","American Society of Heating, Refrigerating and Air-Conditioning Engineers","","National Renewable Energy Lab.

Efficiency improvements and advanced control strategies have a significant impact in the reduction of energy costs and CO2 emissions.

Furthermore, recent advances in data processing and computing have led to the development of sophisticated machine learning algorithms that can learn from large datasets, e.g., sensor data from buildings, and use them to develop building-specific adaptive and automatic energy controllers. Control algorithms, such as deep reinforcement learning can tune themselves, are model-free, and economical to implement. In this paper, we introduce an integrated simulation environment that combines CitySim, a fast building energy simulator, and TensorFlow, a platform for efficient implementation of advanced machine learning algorithms. The integration is achieved via Keras - an API for TensorFlow - and a set of text and csv files for data transfer between the applications. This new environment will allow researchers to investigate novel learning control algorithms, and demonstrate their robustness and potential for diverse applications in the built environment.

It is essential to create an updated urban-scale building energy consumption database to represent energy use for different types of buildings in China, which could help urban planners, managers and decision makers to understand temporal and spatial building energy consumption distribution and ensure required electricity and/or gas supply. However, such urban-scale database is rarely found in China. This paper creates baseline EnergyPlus models for residential, small office and large office buildings and validates the baseline models using survey data from literature. Parametric simulations are conducted to consider different design factors, such as building enclosure, lighting power density, equipment power density, HVAC schedule, etc. In total 351 EnergyPlus models are generated to cover different energy use intensity scenarios. Data-driven regression analysis is conducted to predict building energy consumption using building price/rent. The prediction results are expected to provide design decision support for urban planning and power distribution for new constructions.","Elsevier","","Lawrence Berkeley National Lab.

In this study, a custom-designed electrochemical cell is utilized to investigate planar polycrystalline copper as an electrocatalyst for CO reduction under alkaline conditions. Seven major CO reduction products have been observed including various hydrocarbons and oxygenates which are also common CO<sub>2</sub> reduction products, strongly indicating that CO is a key reaction intermediate for these further-reduced products. A comparison of CO and CO<sub>2</sub> reduction demonstrates that there is a large decrease in the overpotential for C–C coupled products under CO reduction conditions. The effects of CO partial pressure and electrolyte pH are investigated; we conclude that the aforementioned large potential shift is primarily a pH effect. Thus, alkaline conditions can be used to increase the energy efficiency of CO and CO<sub>2</sub> reduction to C–C coupled products, when these cathode reactions are coupled to the oxygen evolution reaction at the anode. Further analysis of the reaction products reveals common trends in selectivity that indicate both the production of oxygenates and C–C coupled products are favored at lower overpotentials. These selectivity trends are generalized by comparing the results on planar Cu to current state-of-the-art high-surface-area Cu catalysts, which are able to achieve high oxygenate selectivity by operating at the same geometric current density at lower overpotentials. Combined, these findings outline key principles for designing CO and CO<sub>2</sub> electrolyzers that are able to produce valuable C–C coupled products with high energy efficiency.","American Chemical Society (ACS)","","SLAC National Accelerator Lab., Menlo Park, CA (United States)","USDOE Office of Science (SC), Basic Energy Sciences (BES)","","United States","2018-07-18T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: ACS Catalysis; Journal Volume: 8; Journal Issue: 8; Related Information: The Supporting Information is available free of charge on the ACS Publications website at https://pubs.acs.org/doi/suppl/10.1021/acscatal.8b01200","","Medium: ED; Size: p. 7445-7454","","","SC0004993; AC02-76SF00515","Journal ID: ISSN 2155-5435","10.1021/acscatal.8b01200","","2022-03-30T00:00:00Z","1469211","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/1469211","https://www.osti.gov/servlets/purl/1469211","ACS Catalysis","8","8"

However, the emissions-intensive nature of the Haber–Bosch process, as well as a depleting supply of these fossil fuels have motivated the production of ammonia using renewable sources of energy. Small-scale, distributed processes may better enable the use of renewables, but also result in a loss of economies of scale, so the high capital cost of the Haber–Bosch process may inhibit this paradigm shift. A process that operates at lower pressure and uses absorption rather than condensation to remove ammonia from unreacted nitrogen and hydrogen has been proposed as an alternative. In this work, a dynamic model of this absorbent-enhanced process is proposed and implemented in gPROMS ModelBuilder. This dynamic model is used to determine optimal designs of this process that minimize the 20-year net present cost at small scales of 100 kg/h to 10,000 kg/h when powered by wind energy. The capital cost of this process scales with a 0.77 capacity exponent, and at production scales below 6075 kg/h, it is less expensive than the conventional Haber–Bosch process.</p>","MDPI AG","","Univ. of Minnesota, Minneapolis, MN (United States)","USDOE Advanced Research Projects Agency - Energy (ARPA-E)","","Switzerland","2018-07-18T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: Processes Journal Volume: 6 Journal Issue: 7","","Medium: X; Size: Article No. 91","","","AR0000804","Journal ID: ISSN 2227-9717; PROCCO; PII: pr6070091","10.3390/pr6070091","","2020-11-30T00:00:00Z","1460897","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/1460897","","Processes","7","6"

Advanced vehicles powered by low-carbon sources of electricity or hydrogen offer an alternative to conventional fossil-fuelled technologies. Yet, despite ambitious pledges and investments by governments and automakers, it is by no means clear that these vehicles will ultimately reach mass-market consumers. In this work, we develop state-of-the-art representations of consumer preferences in multiple global energy-economy models, specifically focusing on the non-financial preferences of individuals. We employ these enhanced model formulations to analyse the potential for a low-carbon vehicle revolution up to 2050. Our analysis shows that a diverse set of measures targeting vehicle buyers is necessary to drive widespread adoption of clean technologies. Carbon pricing alone is insufficient to bring low-carbon vehicles to the mass market, though it may have a supporting role in ensuring a decarbonized energy supply.","Nature Publishing Group","","Oak Ridge National Lab.

Data center cooling accounts for about 1% of electricity usage in the United States. Computer models are pivotal in designing and operating energy-efficient cooling systems. Compared to conventional building performance simulation programs, the equation-based object-oriented modeling language Modelica is an emerging approach that can enable fast prototyping and dynamic simulation of cooling systems. In this case study, we first modeled the cooling and control systems of an actual data center located in Massachusetts using the open-source Modelica Buildings library, and then calibrated a baseline model based on measurement data. The simulation of the baseline model identified several operation-related issues in the cooling and control systems, such as degraded cooling coils, improper dead band in control settings, and simultaneous cooling and heating in air handlers. Afterwards, we used a sequential search technique as well as an optimization scheme to investigate the energy saving potentials for different energy efficiency measures aiming to address the abovementioned issues. Simulation results show potential energy savings up to 24% by resolving identified control-related issues and optimizing the supply air temperature.","Elsevier","","Univ. of Colorado, Boulder, CO (United States); Lawrence Berkeley National Lab.

The approach can use output from HVAC system models or experimental data to create regression-based performance curves, which are then used within the building simulation. The regression approach is an alternative to modeling new HVAC technologies directly in EnergyPlus or performing co-simulation with a system model in a separate program. The proposed approach connects component and system level designs, and their associated performance, with annual energy use and costs in a variety of climates. This study focused on a Vuilleumier-cycle heat pump for a commercial building. We describe (1) the design and modeling of this system, (2) methods for translating this performance into a simplified model in EnergyPlus, and (3) building energy simulation results in United States climate zones 4-6. The results predict that the Vuilleumier-cycle heat pump will use 34 to 44% less source heating energy than an 80% efficient gas furnace, and more source cooling energy than a SEER 13 air conditioner.

"Occupancy prediction through machine learning and data fusion of environmental sensing and Wi-Fi sensing in buildings","Wang, Wei; Chen, Jiayu; Hong, Tianzhen","32 ENERGY CONSERVATION, CONSUMPTION, AND UTILIZATION","Occupancy information is crucial to building facility design, operation, and energy efficiency. Many studies propose the use of environmental sensors (such as carbon dioxide, air temperature, and relative humidity sensors) and radio-frequency sensors (Wi-Fi networks) to monitor, assess, and predict occupancy information for buildings. As many methods have been developed and a variety of sensory data sources are available, establishing a proper selection of model and data source is critical to the successful implementation of occupancy prediction systems. This study compared three popular machine learning algorithms, including k-nearest neighbors (kNN), support vector machine (SVM), and artificial neural network (ANN), combined with three data sources, including environmental data, Wi-Fi data, and fused data, to optimize the occupancy models’ performance in various scenarios. Three error measurement metrics, the mean average error (MAE), mean average percentage error (MAPE), and root mean squared error (RMSE), have been employed to compare the models’ accuracies. Examined with an on-site experiment, the results suggest that the ANN-based model with fused data has the best performance, while the SVM model is more suitable with Wi-Fi data. The results also indicate that, comparing with independent data sources, the fused data set does not necessarily improve model accuracy but shows a better robustness for occupancy prediction.","","","Lawrence Berkeley National Lab.

"Comparison of One- and Two-Variable Linear Regression Models and Classic Energy Intensity for Energy Performance Tracking of Two Manufacturing Sectors","Guo, Wei; Wenning, Thomas J.; Nimbalkar, Sachin U.; Thirumaran, Kiran; Armstrong, Kristina O.; Levine, Eli","32 ENERGY CONSERVATION, CONSUMPTION, AND UTILIZATION; energy efficiency; energy intensity tracking; energy performance baselining; energy performance tracking; manufacturing facility; linear regression modeling","We report manufacturing facilities consumed about 32% of total domestic energy in the United States in 2016. To evaluate the energy savings achieved through the implementation of energy conservation projects and to establish powerful arguments for future projects, accurate energy performance tracking methods are necessary. The classic energy intensity method (i.e., the ratio of annual total energy over annual total production) is the means most widely used to measure savings because it can be understood and calculated easily. This method considers the variation in production rates to some extent; however, it fundamentally assumes facilities' base energy consumption (energy consumption at zero production) to be zero, which rarely holds true. Furthermore, this method does not consider variations in other relevant parameters, such as weather conditions. Therefore, the regression models approach is commonly recommended to track energy performance improvements. However, because it requires more data and statistical expertise, the regression models approach has been adopted by only a few facilities, and many others suspect it is not worth the effort for their specific cases. For this reason, the improved accuracy this approach offers needs to be demonstrated. By analyzing 477 monthly energy (electricity and natural gas) data sets, this study quantitatively compared the accuracy of classic energy intensity, one-variable (production only) linear regression models, and two-variable (i.e., production and weather) linear regression models for two manufacturing sectors (primary metal and transportation equipment manufacturing). Results showed that significant improvements in accuracy were achieved with one-variable regression models when compared with the classic energy intensity method and with two-variable regression models when compared with one-variable regression models. These improvements were demonstrated using the p values of intercept, cooling degree days, and heating degree days. Based on these results, to achieve a good balance between accuracy improvements and resources requirements, one-variable (production only) linear regression models for electricity consumption and two-variable (production and heating degree days) linear regression models for natural gas consumption are recommended for both sectors in the case of limited resources. Lastly, facilities can also use the results to decide which approaches fit better in their cases.","Taylor & Francis","","Oak Ridge National Lab.

However, the flexibility in building loads can be exploited to provide ancillary services to enhance the grid reliability. In this paper, we investigate two control strategies that allow Heating, Ventilation and Air-Conditioning (HVAC) systems in commercial and residential buildings to provide frequency regulation services to the grid while maintaining occupants comfort. The first optimal control strategy is based on model predictive control acting on a variable air volume HVAC system (continuously variable HVAC load), which is available in large commercial buildings. The second strategy is rule-based control acting on an aggregate of on/off HVAC systems, which are available in residential buildings in addition to many small to medium size commercial buildings. Hardware constraints that include limiting the switching between the different states for on/off HVAC units to maintain their lifetimes are considered. Furthermore, simulations illustrate that the proposed control strategies provide frequency regulation to the grid, without affecting the indoor climate significantly.</p>","MDPI AG","","Oak Ridge National Lab.

But to integrate them into building conditioning, there must be a broader selection of PCS devices available. Design guidance and standards are needed to assure that such devices provide high levels of comfort effectiveness and energy efficiency. This study addresses these needs. A suite of minimum-power PCS devices was built that target body parts significant to alliesthesia—a heated shoe insole, heated/cooled wristpad, small deskfan, and heated/cooled chair. They were tested in a climate chamber under cool and warm conditions using both thermal-manikin and human-subjects. Their efficiency at physically heating/cooling the body is high; the combined suite has a coefficient of performance (COP) of 3.6 for cooling and 0.88 for heating. The subjects' whole-body thermal acceptance and thermal comfort perception were improved by the devices in an additive manner; using the combined suite over 80% of people accepted ambient temperatures of 18°C and 29°C. The PCS ‘corrects’ the ambient temperature towards thermal neutrality by as much as 6.5 K cooling and 3.6 K heating, overcoming building occupants' typical interpersonal thermal differences and making possible large HVAC energy savings in buildings. The idea of temperature corrective power can be the basis of standards for PCS.","Elsevier","","Univ. of California, Berkeley, CA (United States)","USDOE Advanced Research Projects Agency - Energy (ARPA-E)","","United States","2018-07-11T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: Building and Environment; Journal Volume: 143","","Medium: ED; Size: p. 206-216","","","AR0000529","Journal ID: ISSN 0360-1323; PII: S0360132318304165","10.1016/j.buildenv.2018.07.008","","2022-04-25T00:00:00Z","1613635","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/1613635","https://www.osti.gov/servlets/purl/1613635","Building and Environment","","143"

The ECM experimental results showed good agreement with the simulated results. The ECM was used to assess the impact of evaporation from porous roof tiles on the cooling load of a one-floor building in subtropical China. The results show that the evaporation process decreased the maximal values of the external and internal roof surface temperatures by up to 6.4 °C and 3.2 °C, respectively, while the lower internal surface temperature decreased the room accumulated cooling load by up to 14.8% during the hot summer period.

The production process of modified atmosphere insulation is much simpler than traditional vacuum insulation manufacturing, and it has the potential for significant cost reduction at the same thermal performance. Prototypes of small- and full-scale composite insulation boards were created for testing and evaluation under laboratory and natural weatherization conditions. The laboratory tests showed that the overall thermal resistance of the composite insulation board is at least twice that of current rigid foam insulation used in building envelope. Lastly, ongoing test of the composite insulation in a natural exposure test facility indicates that the high thermal performance was retained through handling and installation as well as natural aging over a period of one and a half years.","Elsevier","","Oak Ridge National Lab.

The purpose of this paper is to study a nonpreemptive scheduling problem on a single-machine to minimize the total tardiness and total energy cost under time-of-use electricity tariffs, which is a mixed-integer multi-objective mathematical programming model. To achieve these objectives, we develop several new holistic genetic algorithms. The proposed model is solved via several methods including weighted sum method and multiobjective genetic algorithms based on dominance rank (GA-1), weighted sum aggregation (GA-2), dominance ranking procedure and crowding distance comparison (GA-3), and heuristic approach (GA-H). Here, this paper illustrates that operations management, which is typically observed as a significant technique that allows manufacturing to operate in challenging data enabled environment in an industrial internet of things ecosystem, can also carefully optimize a production process to improve energy cost in order to manage environmental challenges.

"Clustering and statistical analyses of air-conditioning intensity and use patterns in residential buildings","An, Jingjing; Yan, Da; Hong, Tianzhen","32 ENERGY CONSERVATION, CONSUMPTION, AND UTILIZATION","Energy conservation in residential buildings has gained increased attention due to its large portion of global energy use and potential of energy savings. Occupant behavior has been recognized as a key factor influencing the energy use and load diversity in buildings, therefore more realistic and accurate air-conditioning (AC) operating schedules are imperative for load estimation in equipment design and operation optimization. With the development of sensor technology, it became easier to access an increasing amount of heating/cooling data from thermal energy metering systems in residential buildings, which provides another possible way to understand building energy usage and occupant behaviors. However, except for cooling energy consumption benchmarking, there currently lacks effective and easy approaches to analyze AC usage and provide actionable insights for occupants. To fill this gap, this study proposes clustering analysis to identify AC use patterns of residential buildings, and develops new key performance indicators (KPIs) and data analytics to explore the AC operation characteristics using the long-term metered cooling energy use data, which is of great importance for inhabitants to understand their thermal energy use and save energy cost through adjustment of their AC use behavior. We demonstrate the proposed approaches in a residential district comprising 300 apartments, located in Zhengzhou, China. Main outcomes include: Representative AC use patterns are developed for three room types of residential buildings in the cold climate zone of China, which can be used as more realistic AC schedules to improve accuracy of energy simulation; Distributions of KPIs on household cooling energy usage are established, which can be used for household AC use intensity benchmarking and performance diagnoses.","Elsevier","","Lawrence Berkeley National Lab.

To promote the application of bedroom TAC to a larger region, a numerical study was carried out on a bedroom TAC system applied in five different climate zones. To simplify the numerical study, response surface methodology (RSM) was used to predict operating power of TAC based on CFD results. It's found that the daily energy consumption in the typical day was from 0 kWh in Kunming to 1.27 kWh in Shanghai, the averaged daily energy consumption varied from 0.47 kWh in June to 0.56 kWh in August for Guangzhou, and the total energy consumption in summer ranged from 0 kWh in Kunming to 58.33 kWh in Guangzhou. Meanwhile, the operating time of the TAC were also different between these five cities. In order to save energy, different set points of t<sub>oz</sub> (average air temperature in the occupied zone) were investigated. Additionally, it's found that increasing the t<sub>oz</sub> from 24 to 25 °C can reduce energy consumption by about 23.42% in Shanghai to 36.23% in Beijing. Besides, the energy saving potential using two operating modes were compared: variable air flow rate and variable air temperature.","Elsevier","","Oak Ridge National Lab.

"Experimentally-determined characteristics of radiant systems for office buildings","Jia, Hongyuan; Pang, Xiufeng; Haves, Philip","32 ENERGY CONSERVATION, CONSUMPTION, AND UTILIZATION","Radiant heating and cooling systems have significant energy-saving potential and are gaining popularity in commercial buildings. The main aim of the experimental study reported here was to characterize the behavior of radiant cooling systems in a typical office environment, including the effect of ceiling fans on stratification, the variation in comfort conditions from perimeter to core, control on operative temperature vs. air temperature and the effect of carpet on cooling capacity. The goal was to limit both the first cost and the perceived risk associated with such systems. Two types of radiant systems, the radiant ceiling panel (RCP) system and the radiant slab (RS) system, were investigated. The experiments were carried out in one of the test cells that constitute the FLEXLAB test facility at the Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory in March and April 2016. In total, ten test cases (five for RCP and five for RS) were performed, covering a range of operational conditions. In cooling mode, the air temperature stratification is relatively small in the RCP, with a maximum value of 1.6 K. The observed stratification effect was significantly greater in the RS, twice as much as that in the RCP. The maximum increase in dry bulb temperature in the perimeter zone due to solar radiation was 1.2 K for RCP and 0.9 K for RS – too small to have a significant impact on thermal comfort. The use of ceiling fans was able to reduce any excess stratification and provide better indoor comfort, if required. The use of thin carpet requires a 1 K lower supply chilled water temperature to compensate for the added thermal resistance, somewhat reducing the opportunities for water-side free cooling and increasing the risk of condensation. In both systems, the difference between the room operative temperature and the room air temperature is small when the cooling loads are met by the radiant systems. In conclusion, this makes it possible to use the air temperature to control the radiant systems in lieu of the operative temperature, reducing both first cost and maintenance costs.","Elsevier","","Lawrence Berkeley National Lab.

"A New Fast Fluid Dynamics Model for Data-Center Floor Plenums","Tian, Wei; VanGilder, James W.; Han, Xu; Healey, Christopher M.; Condor, Michael B.; Zuo, Wangda","42 ENGINEERING; 32 ENERGY CONSERVATION, CONSUMPTION, AND UTILIZATION","A raised-floor plenum is often used to distribute cooling airflow in data centers. Traditional Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) can accurately model airflow distribution in plenums, but it is expensive (computationally and financially) and is, therefore, often not accessible to the data center designer or operator. This paper presents an alternative CFD methodology based on Fast Fluid Dynamics (FFD), which is faster, more parallelizable, and simpler to program. The improvement in computational speed afforded by FFD is particularly important for multiple-iteration optimization, transient simulations, or applications for which near-real-time performance is required. Here, the potential speed improvements of FFD have been widely documented; however, it has been generally accepted that this benefit is accompanied by a modest loss of accuracy relative to traditional CFD. We show here that this is not necessarily true. Plenum airflow predictions by our FFD implementation, which utilizes a first-order upwind rather than Semi-Lagrangian advection scheme of previous research, are extremely close to those predicted by traditional CFD - provided the same turbulence model and computational grid are used consistently.","ASHRAE","","Univ. of Colorado, Boulder, CO (United States)","USDOE Office of Energy Efficiency and Renewable Energy (EERE), Energy Efficiency Office.

However, the current deployment of such CHP systems in the U.S. residential sector is extremely low primarily due to their high cost, short system life, and low system efficiency. Based on an analysis of average energy consumption of representative single-family homes in 10 U.S. cities across 7 different climate zones, it is concluded that there is no one-size-fits-all residential CHP system, but that a range of products are more likely to reflect consumer preferences. It is further identified via a systematic techno-economic analysis (TEA) that high-efficiency (e.g., 30% - 40% fuel to electricity), long-life (e.g., 15 years), low-cost (preferably less than U.S. $2,500 installed price), and low emissions are key requirements to enable widespread deployment of CHP systems in the U.S. residential sector. This article analyzes how the payback period would change for each city by varying nearly a dozen parameters and concludes with an evaluation on maximum market penetration based on a given set of parameters, and the resulting energy and emissions savings that can be practically achieved in some scenarios.","Elsevier","","Booz Allen Hamilton, Inc., McLean, VA (United States)","USDOE Advanced Research Projects Agency - Energy (ARPA-E)","","United States","2018-06-22T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: Applied Energy; Journal Volume: 226; Journal Issue: C; Related Information: http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.apenergy.2018.06.013","","Medium: ED; Size: p. 1064-1075","","","AR0000154; 89703018CAR000001","Journal ID: ISSN 0306-2619; PII: S0306261918308821","10.1016/j.apenergy.2018.06.013","","2021-10-26T00:00:00Z","1458448","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/1458448","https://www.osti.gov/servlets/purl/1458448","Applied Energy","C","226"
"Fuel consumption for various driving styles in conventional and hybrid electric vehicles: Integrating driving cycle predictions with fuel consumption optimization","Rios-Torres, Jackeline; Liu, Jun; Khattak, Asad","32 ENERGY CONSERVATION, CONSUMPTION, AND UTILIZATION; 29 ENERGY PLANNING, POLICY, AND ECONOMY; Driving cycle; equivalent consumption minimization strategy (ECMS); fuel consumption; hybrid electric vehicle (HEV); optimal energy management","Here, improving fuel economy and lowering emissions are key societal goals. Standard driving cycles, pre-designed by the US Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), have long been used to estimate vehicle fuel economy in laboratory-controlled conditions. They have also been used to test and tune different energy management strategies for hybrid electric vehicles (HEVs). This paper aims to estimate fuel consumption for a conventional vehicle and a HEV using personalized driving cycles extracted from real-world data to study the effects of different driving styles and vehicle types on fuel consumption when compared to the estimates based on standard driving cycles. To do this, we extracted driving cycles for conventional vehicles and HEVs from a large-scale U.S. survey that contains real-world GPS-based driving records. Next, the driving cycles were assigned to one of three categories: volatile, normal, or calm. Then, the driving cycles were used along with a driver-vehicle simulation that captures driver decisions (vehicle speed during a trip), powertrain, and vehicle dynamics to estimate fuel consumption for conventional vehicles and HEVs with power-split powertrain. To further optimize fuel consumption for HEVs, the Equivalent Consumption Minimization Strategy (ECMS) is applied. The results show that depending on the driving style and the driving scenario, conventional vehicle fuel consumption can vary widely compared with standard EPA driving cycles. Specifically, conventional vehicle fuel consumption was 13% lower in calm urban driving, but almost 34% higher for volatile highway driving compared with standard EPA driving cycles. Interestingly, when a driving cycle is predicted based on the application of case-based reasoning and used to tune the power distribution in a hybrid electric vehicle, its fuel consumption can be reduced by up to 12% in urban driving. Implications and limitations of the findings are discussed.","Taylor & Francis","","Oak Ridge National Lab.

However, the potential value of distributed generation and demand flexibility has not yet been fully realized in the operation of MGs. This study investigates the pricing and operation strategy with DR for a MG retailer in an integrated energy system (IES). Based on co-optimizing retail rates and MG dispatch formulated as a mixed integer quadratic programming (MIQP) problem, our model devises a dynamic pricing scheme that reflects the cost of generation and promotes DR, in tandem with an optimal dispatch plan that exploits spark spread and facilitates the integration of renewables, resulting in improved retailer profits and system stability. Main issues like integrated energy coupling and customer bill reduction are addressed during pricing to ensure rates competitiveness and customer protection. By evaluating on real datasets, the system is demonstrated to optimally coordinate storage, renewables, and combined heat and power (CHP), reduce carbon dioxide emission while maintaining profits, and effectively alleviate the PV curtailment problem. Finally, the model can be used by retailers and MG operators to optimize their operations, as well as regulators to design new utility rates in support of the ongoing transformation of energy systems.","Elsevier","","Lawrence Berkeley National Lab.

National Renewable Energy Laboratory (NREL) researchers developed a sophisticated analysis process to calculate U.S. light-duty A/C fuel use that was used to assess the impact of these technologies, leveraging thermal and vehicle simulation analysis tools developed under previous U.S. Department of Energy projects. Representative U.S. light-duty driving behaviors and weighting factors including time-of-day of travel, trip duration, and time between trips were characterized and integrated into the analysis. In addition, U.S. weather conditions weighted based on light-duty vehicle registrations were generated and used for the analysis. Three representative vehicle types for the light-duty fleet were selected based on registration data containing vehicle size information. These key inputs were used to support a weighted parametric analysis that quantified vehicle thermal load, vehicle accessory load, and vehicle fuel use. This analysis estimates that 7.6 billion gallons of fuel a year are used in the United States for vehicle A/C, equivalent to 6.1% of the total national light-duty vehicle fuel use. This equates to 30.0 gallons/year per vehicle or 23.5 grams CO<sub>2</sub> per mile (g/mi) for an average U.S. light-duty vehicle. A/C is a significant contributor to national fuel use; therefore, technologies that reduce A/C loads have an opportunity to reduce fuel consumption, reduce imported oil, and improve energy security. Implementing solar control glass reduced the CO<sub>2</sub> emissions by 2.0 g/mi and the reduction due to solar reflective paint was 0.8 g/mi. The active and passive ventilation strategies as defined in this analysis only reduced emissions by 0.1 and 0.2 g/mi, respectively. This analysis shows the potential to reduce operational costs, A/C fuel use, and CO<sub>2</sub> emissions by implementing advanced vehicle climate control technologies including the solar/thermal technologies.","SAE International","","National Renewable Energy Lab.

H.; Arendt, K.; Rivalin, L.; Piette, M. A.; Wetter, M.; Veje, C. T.","32 ENERGY CONSERVATION, CONSUMPTION, AND UTILIZATION","Model predictive control (MPC) for buildings is attracting significant attention in research and industry due to its potential to address a number of challenges facing the building industry, including energy cost reduction, grid integration, and occupant connectivity. However, the strategy has not yet been implemented at any scale, largely due to the significant effort required to configure and calibrate the model used in the MPC controller. While many studies have focused on methods to expedite model configuration and improve model accuracy, few have studied the impact a wide range of factors have on the accuracy of the resulting model. In addition, few have continued on to analyze these factors’ impact on MPC controller performance in terms of final operating costs. Therefore, this study first identifies the practical factors affecting model setup, specifically focusing on the thermal envelope. The seven that are identified are building design, model structure, model order, data set, data quality, identification algorithm and initial guesses, and software tool-chain. Then, through a large number of trials, it analyzes each factor's influence on model accuracy, focusing on grey-box models for a single zone building envelope. Finally, this study implements a subset of the models identified with these factor variations in heating, ventilating, and air conditioning MPC controllers, and tests them in simulation of a representative case that aims to optimally cool a single-zone building with time-varying electricity prices. It is found that a difference of up to 20%25 in cooling cost for the cases studied can occur between the best performing model and the worst performing model. The primary factors attributing to this were model structure and initial parameter guesses during parameter estimation of the model.","Elsevier","","Lawrence Berkeley National Lab.

For this purpose, Li<sub>2</sub>ZrO<sub>3</sub> and Na<sub>2</sub>ZrO<sub>3</sub> were synthesized, characterized and tested on a consecutive process composed of initial CO<sub>2</sub> capture, followed by methane dry reforming (MDR). Thermogravimetric results showed that under the four gas mixtures tested (diluted and saturated CO<sub>2</sub>, CO and CO-O<sub>2</sub>), both ceramics are able to chemisorb CO<sub>2</sub>, with Na2ZrO3 having the highest capture with saturated CO<sub>2</sub>. In catalytic tests, ceramics carbonated with saturated CO<sub>2</sub> or CO-O<sub>2</sub> gas flows were able to act as sorbents and catalysts, producing H<sub>2</sub> at T > 750 °C through the partial oxidation of methane. This reaction was produced because CO2 desorption did not occur, thus avoiding the MDR process. On the other hand, carbonated ceramics under a CO-O2 gas mixture presented an outstanding catalytic performance. Between 450 and 750 °C, H<sub>2</sub> was formed through the MDR process promoted by CO<sub>2</sub> desorption from both ceramics. This result is in line with CO<sub>2</sub> desorption results, where a weaker CO<sub>2</sub>–solid interaction was observed in comparison with saturated CO<sub>2</sub>2. Afterward, both ceramics presented a similar catalytic behavior, good regeneration and cyclability after the double process proposed (CO<sub>2</sub> capture-MDR reaction). Lithium zirconate also presented high thermal stability during cycle tests; meanwhile, sodium zirconate showed an important H<sub>2</sub> production increase as a function of cycles. Finally, both materials are feasible options for producing a clean energy source in a moderate temperature range through the catalytic conversion of two greenhouse gases (CO<sub>2</sub> and CH<sub>4</sub>).","Elsevier","","National Energy Technology Lab.

"A hybrid building thermal modeling approach for predicting temperatures in typical, detached, two-story houses","Cui, Borui; Fan, Cheng; Munk, Jeffrey D.; Mao, Ning; Xiao, Fu; Dong, Jin; Kuruganti, Teja","32 ENERGY CONSERVATION, CONSUMPTION, AND UTILIZATION; Building demand management; Data-driven model; Supervised machine learning; Particle swarm optimization","Within the residential building sector, the air-conditioning (AC) load is the main target for peak load shifting and reduction since it is the largest contributor to peak demand. By leveraging its power flexibility, residential AC is a good candidate to provide building demand response and peak load shifting. For realization of accurate and reliable control of AC loads, a building thermal model, which characterizes the properties of a building’s envelope and its thermal mass, is an essential component for accurate indoor temperature or cooling/heating demand prediction. Building thermal models include two types: “Forward” and “Data-Driven”. Due to time-saving and cost-effective characteristics, different data-driven models have been developed in a number of research studies. However, few developed models can predict temperatures in respective zones of a multiple-zone building with an open air path between zones e.g., an open stairwell connecting two floors of a home. In this research, a novel hybrid modeling approach is proposed to predict the average indoor air temperatures of both the upstairs and downstairs. This “hybrid” solution integrates both gray-box, i.e. RC model and black-box models. A developed RC model is used to predict the building mean temperature, and black-box model, in which the supervised machine learning algorithms are leveraged, is used to predict the temperature difference between the downstairs and upstairs. Compared with the measured data from a real house, the results obtained have acceptable/satisfactory accuracy. The method proposed in this study integrates the advantages of black-box and gray-box modeling. As a result, it can be used as a reliable alternative to predict the average temperatures in respective floors of typical detached two-story houses.","Elsevier","","Oak Ridge National Lab.

"Forecasting Peak Electricity Demand for Los Angeles Considering Higher Air Temperatures due to Climate Change","Burillo, Daniel; Chester, Mikhail V.; Pincetl, Stephanie; Fournier, Eric D.; Reyna, Janet","29 ENERGY PLANNING, POLICY, AND ECONOMY; 32 ENERGY CONSERVATION, CONSUMPTION, AND UTILIZATION; building energy modeling; peak demand; demand forecasting; spatial analysis; heat waves; climate change","We report that Los Angeles County (LAC) is a large urbanized region with 9.7 million residents (as of 2010) and aging infrastructure. Population forecasts indicate that LAC will become home to an additional 1.2-3.1 million residents through 2060. Additionally, climate forecasts based upon representative concentration pathway (RCP) scenarios 4.5 and 8.5 indicate that average air temperatures will increase by 1-4 degrees C (2-7 degrees F) in the region. Both of these factors are expected to result in higher summertime peak electricity demand due to growth in the number of buildings, the percentage of installed air conditioners (ACs), and the additional cooling load on those air conditioners. In order to understand potential power reliability issues, and support infrastructure planning efforts, a long-term peak demand forecast was developed using hourly residential and commercial (R&C) building energy models. Peak hour electricity demand was estimated to increase from 9.5 to 12.8 GW for R&C sectors, to 13.0-17.3 GW (2-36%) and 14.7-19.2 GW (16-51%) by 2060 for the population forecasts from the California Department of Finance and the Southern California Association of Governments respectively. While marginal increases in ambient air temperature due to climate change accounted for only 4-8% of future increases in peak demand, differences in annual maximum temperatures within the 20-year periods affected results by 40-66% indicating a high sensitivity to heat waves. Population growth of at least 1 million people is anticipated to occur mostly in the northern cities of Palmdale, Lancaster, and Santa Clarita, bringing an additional 0.4-1 GW of peak demand in those regions. Building and AC efficiency are anticipated to improve as national and state efficiency standards increase, and as older, less efficient units are replaced; this could offset some of the projected increases in peak demand. Furthermore, development of shared wall, multi-family dwelling units could enable population growth of up to 3 million people without increasing peak demand.","Elsevier","","National Renewable Energy Lab.

"Testing and demonstration of model predictive control applied to a radiant slab cooling system in a building test facility","Pang, Xiufeng; Duarte, Carlos; Haves, Philip; Chuang, Frank","32 ENERGY CONSERVATION, CONSUMPTION, AND UTILIZATION","Radiant slab systems have the potential to significantly reduce energy consumption in buildings. However, control of radiant slab systems is challenging. Classical feedback control is inadequate due to the large thermal inertia of the systems and heuristic feed-forward control often leads to unacceptable indoor comfort and may not achieve the full energy savings potential. Model predictive control (MPC) is now attracting increasing interest in the building industry and holds promise for radiant systems. However, an often-cited barrier to its implementation in the building industry is the high computational cost and complexity relative to the feedback controls used in conventional systems. The objectives of this study were to (i) verify the correct operation of an open source MPC toolchain developed for radiant slab systems, and (ii) demonstrate its efficacy in a test facility. A matched pair of cells in the FLEXLAB building test facility at the Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory was used in the study. The proposed MPC toolchain was implemented in one cell and the performance compared to that of the other cell, which used a conventional heuristic control strategy. Finally, the results showed that the simplified MPC approach applied in the toolchain worked as expected and realized energy savings over the conventional control strategy. The MPC yielded 42% chilled water pump power reduction and 16% cooling thermal energy savings, while maintaining equal or better indoor comfort.","Elsevier","","Lawrence Berkeley National Lab.

In this study, we investigate the residual values of PEVs and compare them with those of other vehicle powertrain technologies using the “true market value” data from Edmunds.com, and considering U.S. federal incentives. We define the adjusted retention rate as the ratio between resale value and the manufacturer’s suggested retail price, subtracting incentives. We develop statistical models to quantify the effects of powertrain technologies on residual value while controlling key factors, including vehicle size, brand, and market segments. We find that the long-range high-performance Tesla Model S holds value significantly better than any other vehicle type evaluated, including internal combustion engine vehicles. Hybrid electric vehicles and plugin hybrid electric vehicles are comparable to one another. They hold slightly less value than internal combustion engine vehicles, but significantly more than short-range (<125 miles) battery electric vehicles. However, short-range battery electric vehicles have a faster improvement in 3-year adjusted retention rate than any other powertrain technology from model year 2013–2014. Finally, the other factor that significantly influences adjusted retention rate is the home country of the vehicle manufacturer (e.g., United States, Japan, or Germany).","Elsevier","","Argonne National Lab.

This work presents a comparison between two approaches for developing the preliminary design of an offshore wind plant turbine layout, electrical collection system, and support structures. The first is a sequential approach, where components of the wind farm are optimised sequentially, each with its own objective function, thus neglecting potential interactions between them. The second approach uses Multidisciplinary Design Analysis and Optimisation (MDAO), where all components are jointly optimised with the overall system levelised cost of energy (LCOE) as a global objective function. Studying the cases of regular and irregular layouts, the integrated approach always shows a greater improvement in the LCOE of the final design compared to the design resulting from the traditional sequential approach. The most significant trade-off exploited by the MDAO approach used in this study is between losses in energy production due to turbine wake effects and the costs of electrical cable infrastructure.","IOP Publishing","","National Renewable Energy Lab.

Improving a building's thermal enclosure, installing the ductwork in conditioned space, and improving the building's airtightness results in significant reductions in externally-driven sensible and latent cooling loads. As a building's efficiency is improved, occupant-related internal gains become a larger portion of the building sensible and latent loads. Additionally, internal gains are highly uncertain compared to other load components. In this study, we use a stochastic approach to simulate occupant-related internal gains and compare the internal gains to other sensible and latent heat sources in four house efficiency levels in 10 U.S. climates using whole-building energy simulation software. We compare the expected range in occupant-related internal gains to other building characteristics such as cooling set point, air infiltration rate, and mechanical ventilation rate. We show that in high-efficiency homes, sensible internal gains vary from less than 10% to greater than 40% of the building sensible load under peak total cooling conditions depending on climate and internal gain profile. Likewise, latent internal gains vary from less than 10% to more than 60% of the building latent load under peak total cooling and peak dehumidification conditions depending on climate and internal gain profile.","Elsevier","","Oak Ridge National Lab.

"Occupancy prediction through Markov based feedback recurrent neural network (M-FRNN) algorithm with WiFi probe technology","Wang, Wei; Chen, Jiayu; Hong, Tianzhen; Zhu, Na","97 MATHEMATICS AND COMPUTING; 32 ENERGY CONSERVATION, CONSUMPTION, AND UTILIZATION","Accurate occupancy prediction can improve facility control and energy efficiency of buildings. In recent years, buildings’ exiting WiFi infrastructures have been widely studied in the research of occupancy and energy conservation. However, using WiFi to assess occupancy is challenging due to that occupancy information is often characterized stochastically and varies with time and easily disturbed by building components. To overcome such limitations, this study utilizes WiFi probe technology to actively scan WiFi connection requests and responses between access points and network devices of building occupants. With captured signals, this study proposed a Markov based feedback recurrent neural network (M-FRNN) algorithm to model and predict the occupancy profiles. One on-site experiment was conducted to collect ground truth data using camera-based video analysis and the results were used to validate the M-FRNN occupancy prediction model over a 9-day measurement period. From the results, the M-FRNN based occupancy model using WiFi probes shows best accuracies can reach 80.9%, 89.6%, and 93.9% with a tolerance of 2, 3, and 4 occupants respectively. In conclusion, this study demonstrated that WiFi data coupled with stochastic machine learning system can provide a viable alternative to determine a building's occupancy profile.","Elsevier","","Lawrence Berkeley National Lab.

These forecasts are an important input to integrated resource planning (IRP) processes involving utilities, regulators, and other stake-holders. Despite their importance, however, there has been little analysis of long term utility load forecasting accuracy. We conduct a retrospective analysis of long term load forecasts on twelve Western U. S. electric utilities in the mid-2000s to find that most overestimated both energy consumption and peak demand growth. A key reason for this was the use of assumptions that led to an overestimation of economic growth. We find that the complexity of forecast methods and the accuracy of these forecasts are mildly correlated. In addition, sensitivity and risk analysis of load growth and its implications for capacity expansion were not well integrated with subsequent implementation. As a result, we review changes in the utilities load forecasting methods over the subsequent decade, and discuss the policy implications of long term load forecast inaccuracy and its underlying causes.","Elsevier","","Lawrence Berkeley National Lab.

For an efficient integration of photovoltaic generation, a gain scheduling wide-area damping controller (WADC) is designed to guarantee system damping performance under a wide-area signal delay and a changing operating condition, which could be aggravated by the fluctuant and uncertain photovoltaic generation. A linear parameter-varying (LPV) model is proposed to represent all possible operating conditions within varying ranges of the photovoltaic generation and the load. Then, a tensor product (TP) model transformation is applied to transform the LPV model into a TP model. Based on the TP model, a parallel distributed compensation controller (PDC) framework is adopted to design the gain scheduling WADC, which is solved by linear matrix inequalities (LMIs) considering the accommodation to the random interval delay. In addition, a staircase basis function method is proposed to reduce the conservatism of LMIs within the PDC framework. The gain of the proposed WADC will be adjusted according to the operating condition acknowledged through the real-time scheduling and control center, once a wide-area oscillation is detected. Lastly, the performance of the proposed WADC is verified by a 2-area 4-machine system and a 68-bus 16-machine system.","IEEE","","Oak Ridge National Lab.

The new polylactic acid polymer liner is made from renewable feedstock such as carbon found in plant sugars. The energy use over the life of refrigerator and freezer is calculated using the Energy-Efficient Refrigerator Analysis program developed by the United States Department of Energy to estimate the energy savings potential of various technology option upgrades (cabinet and refrigeration system) for rulemaking purposes. The simulation results show that energy savings from implementing the Ingeo liner range from 818 to 1395tkWh (7.3–12.5% of total energy use) over a 15-year period. In addition to the energy savings, the slower increase in the thermal conductivity of the insulation could allow the compressor to run fewer hours per year compared with a case in which the foam thermal conductivity increases rapidly. This change could increase the life of the compressor and the refrigerators and freezers. As a result, this study does not attempt to quantify the impact of slower foam aging on the compressor life.","Elsevier","","Oak Ridge National Lab.

To address this concern, an ontology was developed using the drivers-needs-actions-systems (DNAS) framework. Recent work has been carried out to implement the theoretical DNAS framework into an eXtensible Markup Language (XML) schema, titled ‘occupant behaviour XML’ (obXML) which is a practical implementation of OB models that can be integrated into building performance simulation (BPS) programs. This paper presents a newly developed library of OB models represented in the standardised obXML schema format. This library provides ready-to-use examples for BPS users to employ more accurate occupant representation in their energy models. The library, which contains an initial effort of 52 OB models, was made publicly available for the BPS community. As part of the library development process, limitations of the obXML schema were identified and addressed, and future improvements were proposed. Authors hope that by compiling this library building, energy modellers from all over the world can enhance their BPS models by integrating more accurate and robust OB patterns.","Springer","","Lawrence Berkeley National Lab.

"Building simulation: Ten challenges","Hong, Tianzhen; Langevin, Jared; Sun, Kaiyu","32 ENERGY CONSERVATION, CONSUMPTION, AND UTILIZATION; building energy use; energy efficiency; building performance simulation; energy modeling; building life cycle; zero-net-energy buildings","Buildings consume more than one-third of the world’s primary energy. Reducing energy use and greenhouse-gas emissions in the buildings sector through energy conservation and efficiency improvements constitutes a key strategy for achieving global energy and environmental goals. Building performance simulation has been increasingly used as a tool for designing, operating and retrofitting buildings to save energy and utility costs. However, opportunities remain for researchers, software developers, practitioners and policymakers to maximize the value of building performance simulation in the design and operation of low energy buildings and communities that leverage interdisciplinary approaches to integrate humans, buildings, and the power grid at a large scale. This paper presents ten challenges that highlight some of the most important issues in building performance simulation, covering the full building life cycle and a wide range of modeling scales. In conclusion, the formulation and discussion of each challenge aims to provide insights into the state-of-the-art and future research opportunities for each topic, and to inspire new questions from young researchers in this field.","Springer","","Lawrence Berkeley National Lab.

However, four-electron-driven oxidation half-reaction showing slow kinetics, accompanying with insufficient light absorption and rapid carrier combination in photocatalysts leads to low solar-to-hydrogen energy conversion efficiency. Here, we report amorphous cobalt phosphide (Co-P)-supported black phosphorus nanosheets employed as photocatalysts can simultaneously address these issues. The nanosheets exhibit robust hydrogen evolution from pure water (pH = 6.8) without bias and hole scavengers, achieving an apparent quantum efficiency of 42.55% at 430 nm and energy conversion efficiency of over 5.4% at 353 K. This photocatalytic activity is attributed to extremely efficient utilization of solar energy (~75% of solar energy) by black phosphorus nanosheets and high-carrier separation efficiency by amorphous Co-P. The hybrid material design realizes efficient solar-to-chemical energy conversion in suspension, demonstrating the potential of black phosphorus-based materials as catalysts for solar hydrogen production.","Nature Publishing Group","","Lawrence Berkeley National Lab.

"An Approach to Uncertainty Identification in the Valuation of Transactive Energy Systems","Veeramany, Arun; Woodward, James T.; Hammerstrom, Donald J.","32 ENERGY CONSERVATION, CONSUMPTION, AND UTILIZATION","Valuation of transactive energy (TE) systems should be supported by a structured and systematic approach to uncertainty identification, assessment, and treatment in the interest of risk-informed decision making. The proposed approach, a variation of fault tree analysis, is anticipated to support valuation analysts in analyzing conventional and transactive system scenarios. This approach allows for expanding the entire tree up to the level of minute details or collapsing them to a level sufficient enough to get an overview of the problem. Quantification scheme for the described approach lends itself for valuation. The method complements value exchange analysis, simulation, and field demonstration studies. The practicality of the proposed approach is demonstrated through uncertainty assessment of the smart grid interoperability panel peak heat day scenario.","American Society of Mechanical Engineers","","Pacific Northwest National Lab.

"Efficiency and Reliability Analyses of AC and 380V DC Distribution in Data Centers","Shrestha, Bijen R.; Tamrakar, Ujjwol; Hansen, Timothy M.; Bhattarai, Bishnu P.; James, Sean; Tonkoski, Reinaldo","32 ENERGY CONSERVATION, CONSUMPTION, AND UTILIZATION; data center; efficiency; reliability; renewable integration","Modern data centers consume large amounts of electricity, resulting in high operational costs. The efficiency of a data center power distribution system can be increased, and the operational cost reduced, if the number of power conversion stages can be minimized and more efficient converters, such as wide bandgap (WBG) converters, are used. This can be achieved by using DC distribution voltage at the rack level by eliminating extra conversion stages. In this paper, benchmarks for both AC and 380V DC data centers were developed and efficiency analyses were performed for an entire year. The impact of integrating photovoltaic (PV) systems into the data centers has also been analyzed in both cases in terms of efficiency. The results show that 380V DC data centers are more efficient than AC data centers with and without PV integration. Furthermore, the reliability of an AC system was compared to a 380V DC architecture with Tier-IV standard. Monte-Carlo simulations were used to perform reliability analyses for different levels of redundancy in the Uninterruptible Power Supply (UPS) system for both cases. In conclusion, the simulation results showed that the 380V DC distribution system had a higher level of reliability than the AC distribution system in data centers.","IEEE","","Pacific Northwest National Lab.

In order to design and operate low energy buildings as well as to establish building energy codes and standards and effective energy policy, it is crucial to understand and quantify key factors influencing building energy performance. Here, this study investigates air-conditioning (AC) energy use of four office buildings in four locations: Beijing, Taiwan, Hong Kong, and Berkeley. Building simulation was employed to quantify the influences of key factors, including climate, building envelope and occupant behavior. Through simulation of various combinations of the three influencing elements, it is found that climate can lead to AC cooling consumption differences by almost two times, while occupant behavior resulted in the greatest differences (of up to three times) in AC cooling consumption. The influence of occupant behavior on AC energy consumption is not homogeneous. Under similar climates, when the occupant behavior in the building differed, the optimized building envelope design also differed. In conclusion, the optimal building envelope should be determined according to the climate as well as the occupants who use the building.","Elsevier","","Lawrence Berkeley National Lab.

"The United States Federal Energy Management Program lighting energy efficiency 2017 update and impacts","Siap, David; Payne, Christopher; Lekov, Alex","32 ENERGY CONSERVATION, CONSUMPTION, AND UTILIZATION","Lighting consumes a great deal of electrical energy in buildings, and the U.S. federal government is the largest single energy consumer in the United States. Therefore, the way that the U.S. federal government manages its lighting energy use is of great importance. One important way that energy use is managed is through Federal Energy Management Program (FEMP) energy efficiency requirements. However, there is not much literature on how these requirements are set and how to value the resulting savings. This paper documents the methodology used to develop these for the 2017 FEMP lighting update. A methodology for calculating the total benefits is presented that goes beyond site energy saved, and includes full fuel cycle energy savings, energy cost savings, emissions offset and monetized emissions costs. The results show total benefits of $33 million USD including 475 kilotons of carbon dioxide (CO2) offset under the low compliance scenario, $104 million USD including 1494 kilotons of CO2 offset under the medium compliance scenario, and $217 million USD including 3124 kilotons of CO2 offset under the high compliance scenario.","Elsevier","","Lawrence Berkeley National Lab.

Using taxi-trip data from New York City, we develop an agent-based model to predict the battery range and charging infrastructure requirements of a fleet of SAEVs operating on Manhattan Island. We also develop a model to estimate the cost and environmental impact of providing service and perform extensive sensitivity analysis to test the robustness of our predictions. We estimate that costs will be lowest with a battery range of 50-90 mi, with either 66 chargers per square mile, rated at 11 kW or 44 chargers per square mile, rated at 22 kW. We estimate that the cost of service provided by such an SAEV fleet will be $0.29-$0.61 per revenue mile, an order of magnitude lower than the cost of service of present-day Manhattan taxis and $0.05-$0.08/mi lower than that of an automated fleet composed of any currently available hybrid or internal combustion engine vehicle (ICEV).

Power consumption also plays a major role in the design of data centers, which may house petascale or exascale-level computing systems. At these extreme scales, understanding and improving the energy efficiency of numerical libraries and their related applications becomes a crucial part of the successful implementation and operation of the computing system. In this paper, we study and investigate the practice of controlling a compute system's power usage, and we explore how different power caps affect the performance of numerical algorithms with different computational intensities. Further, we determine the impact, in terms of performance and energy usage, that these caps have on a system running scientific applications. This analysis will enable us to characterize the types of algorithms that benefit most from these power management schemes. Our experiments are performed using a set of representative kernels and several popular scientific benchmarks.

A data-driven method is introduced to formulate a two-dimensional grid stochastic energy consumption model for electric vehicles. This model aids in analyzing EV energy cost and describing uncertainties under variable traffic and ambient temperature conditions. According to this energy consumption model, an optimal eco-routing and charging decision making framework is designed for autonomous EV fleet. This optimization framework can improve the capability of autonomous EV's energy management and help to find their minimum energy cost routes with consideration of charging demand and travel time requirements. Based on these promising models and technologies, comprehensive case studies are performed on a data-driven simulated transportation network in New York City. Detailed results show us the heterogeneous energy impact and charging demand under different ambient temperature. By giving the same travel demand and charging station information, there may be more than 20% difference of overall energy cost and 60% difference of charging demand in a specific charging station between low and high ambient temperature of a month. All these studies will help to construct sustainable infrastructure for autonomous electric vehicle fleet management.","Elsevier","","Idaho National Lab.

"Packaged scalable energy information systems for hotels","Singh, Reshma; Mathew, Paul; Granderson, Jessica; Shukla, Yash; Behera, Amiya Ranjan","32 ENERGY CONSERVATION, CONSUMPTION, AND UTILIZATION","Purpose: Building energy information systems (EIS) are performance monitoring software, data acquisition hardware and communication systems used to store, analyze and display building energy data. Some $60bn are spent annually on wasted energy in the US buildings, and actions taken based on EIS data can enable operational energy savings of approximately 10 per cent in the US commercial sector (approximately two quads of primary energy). However, EIS adoption is low because of various technical and market challenges. This paper aims to provide technical specifications for standardized EIS packages that can help overcome barriers and accelerate scale. Design/methodology/approach: Here, a five-step approach was followed: identifying business drivers as key determinants for hotel sector-specific packages; addressing heterogeneity to develop standardized, tiered packages; determining performance metrics for key stakeholders; recommending streamlined data architecture; and developing visualization enabling insights and actions. Findings: Technical specifications for two tiers (entry and advanced) of EIS packages for hotels have been developed. EIS vendor, integrator and client organization’s facilities and IT staff have been considered as key stakeholders. Findings from six field demonstrations show benefits of cost-effectiveness, through reduced transactional, first and operational costs, scalability, by accommodating heterogeneity across the building sub-sector, simplicity, by integrating meters, gateways and software in the package and actionability in organizations, across various decision-making levels. Originality/value: Building owners and operators can use these specifications to ease procurement and installation of EIS in their facilities. EIS software vendors can use them to develop new product offerings for underserved sectors.","Emerald Publishing","","Lawrence Berkeley National Lab.

The web-based tool models building energy use under standard operating conditions to rate the energy efficiency of the as-built building systems and enable level comparisons of building assets. With basic characteristics entered by users, the tool creates simplified EnergyPlus building models to support the rating analysis. However, even with a reduced set of model inputs, data collection remains a challenge and the commercial building market demands a more simplified entry point to the rating system. This paper discusses a hybrid method that combines regression models with real-time simulations to allow users to enter as few as seven building parameters to quickly assess the building energy performance prior to a full-scale analysis. Built upon large-scale building stock simulations, a random forest approach was used to develop a set of regression models for various building use types. The majority of the Asset Score tool inputs were sampled extensively and fed into the regression models. These were combined with inferred inputs and user-defined uncertainty levels to create a distribution of possible energy use intensities for the building and its Preview score. With additional user inputs, the regression model can be transferred to an energy model for a full-scale energy simulation. The streamlined Asset Score Preview assessment provides an easy entry point to a full Asset Score assessment. It also enables users who manage a large number of buildings to screen and prioritize buildings that can benefit most from a more detailed evaluation and possible energy efficiency upgrades without intensive data collection.","Elsevier","","National Renewable Energy Lab.

"Demand Response-Driven Production and Maintenance Decision-Making for Cost-Effective Manufacturing","Dababneh, Fadwa; Li, Lin; Shah, Rahul; Haefke, Cliff","32 ENERGY CONSERVATION, CONSUMPTION, AND UTILIZATION","Manufacturers consume about 27% of the total electricity in the U.S. and are among the main contributors in the rising electricity demand. End-user electricity demand response is an effective demand side management tool that can help energy suppliers reduce electricity generation expenditures while providing opportunities for manufacturers to decrease operating costs. Several studies on demand response for manufacturers have been conducted. However, there lacks a unified production model that balances production capability degradation, maintenance requirements, and time-of-use (TOU) electricity prices simultaneously such that the interaction between production, maintenance, and electricity costs is considered. In this paper, a cost-effective production and maintenance scheduling model considering TOU electricity demand response is presented. Additionally, an aggregate cost model is formulated, which considers production, maintenance, and demand response parameters in the same function. The proposed models provide manufacturers with tools for implementing feasible and cost-effective demand response while meeting production targets and efficiently allocating maintenance resources. A case study is performed and illustrates that 19% in cost savings can be achieved when using the proposed model compared to solely minimizing the electricity billing cost. In addition, 14% in cost savings can be achieved when using the proposed model compared to a strategy where only the maintenance cost is minimized. Finally, the benefits of demand response driven production and maintenance scheduling under different cost and parameter settings are investigated; where the rated power, production rate, and initial machine production capability show to have the largest impact on the cost effectiveness of implementing demand response.","ASME","","Univ. of Illinois, Chicago, IL (United States)","USDOE Office of Energy Efficiency and Renewable Energy (EERE)","","United States","2018-03-13T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: Journal of Manufacturing Science and Engineering; Journal Volume: 140; Journal Issue: 6","","Medium: ED; Size: Article No. 061008","","","EE0007722","Journal ID: ISSN 1087-1357","10.1115/1.4039197","","2022-06-01T00:00:00Z","1865612","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/1865612","https://www.osti.gov/servlets/purl/1865612","Journal of Manufacturing Science and Engineering","6","140"

Here, a significant amount of research has attempted to utilize thermodynamics (physical) models for smart building control, but these approaches remain challenging due to the stochastic nature of the intermittent environmental disturbances. This paper presents a novel data-driven approach for indoor thermal model inference, which combines an Autoregressive Moving Average with eXogenous inputs model (ARMAX) with a Normalized Mutual Information scheme (NMI). Based on this information-theoretic method, NMI, causal dependencies between the indoor temperature and exogenous inputs are explicitly obtained as a guideline for the ARMAX model to find the dominating inputs. For validation, we use three datasets based on building energy systems-against which we compare our method to an autoregressive model with exogenous inputs (ARX), a regularized ARMAX model, and state-space models.","IEEE","","Carnegie Mellon Univ., Pittsburgh, PA (United States)","USDOE Office of Energy Efficiency and Renewable Energy (EERE), Energy Efficiency Office.

Because of the high cost of noble platinum-group metal (PGM) catalysts (Ir, Ru, Pt, etc.) that are widely used in water splitting, a PEMEC with low catalyst loadings and high catalyst utilizations is strongly desired for its wide commercialization. In this study, the ultrafast and multiscale hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) phenomena in an operating PEMEC is in-situ observed for the first time. The visualization results reveal that the HER and hydrogen bubble nucleation mainly occur on catalyst layers at the rim of the pores of the thin/tunable liquid/gas diffusion layers (TT-LGDLs). This indicates that the catalyst material of the conventional catalyst-coated membrane (CCM) that is located in the middle area of the LGDL pore is underutilized/inactive. Based on this discovery, a novel thin and tunable gas diffusion electrode (GDE) with a Pt catalyst thickness of 15 nm and a total thickness of about 25 um has been proposed and developed by taking advantage of advanced micro/nano manufacturing. The novel thin GDEs are comprehensively characterized both ex-situ and in-situ, and exhibit excellent PEMEC performance. More importantly, they achieve catalyst mass activity of up to 58 times higher than conventional CCM at 1.6 V under the operating conditions of 80 degrees C and 1 atm. This study demonstrates a promising concept for PEMEC electrode development, and provides a direction of future catalyst designs and fabrications for electrochemical devices.","Elsevier","","Oak Ridge National Lab.

A key smart ventilation concept is to use controls to ventilate more at times it provides either an energy or IAQ advantage (or both) and less when it provides a disadvantage. This paper discusses the favorable contexts that exist in many countries, with regulations and standards proposing ‘performance-based approaches’ that both enable and reward smart ventilation. The paper gives an overview of such approaches from five countries. The common thread in all these methods is the use of metrics for the exposure to an indoor generated parameter (usually CO<sub>2</sub>), and condensation risk. As the result, demand-control ventilation strategies (DCV) are widely and easily available on the market, with more than 20–30 systems available in some countries.","Taylor & Francis","","Lawrence Berkeley National Lab.

"Understanding recent market trends of the US ESCO industry","Stuart, Elizabeth; Carvallo, Juan Pablo; Larsen, Peter H.; Goldman, Charles A.; Gilligan, Donald","32 ENERGY CONSERVATION, CONSUMPTION, AND UTILIZATION; ESCO; Energy service companies; Energy efficiency; Economic trends","The US energy services company (ESCO) industry is an example of a private-sector business model that delivers energy savings to customers primarily through the use of performance-based contracts. US ESCO projects garner significant incremental annual savings: approximately 1% of total US commercial building consumption in 2014. From 2000 to 2011, the industry experienced year over year growth; however, based on information drawn from interviews with ESCO executives conducted in late 2015, the authors find that from 2012 to 2014, ESCO industry revenues did not increase. While public and institutional market sectors accounted for 85% of industry revenue in 2014, consistent with previous research findings, the share of revenue from performance contracting increased to 74% in 2014, as compared to 69% share reported for 2011 and 2008. The revenue numbers between 2011 and 2014 are not fully comparable, because a few ESCOs that were subsidiaries of larger companies had undergone reorganization and some categories of revenue reported in 2011 were not included for 2014. Other factors that may have contributed to the recent revenue trend include the following: (1) increased competition from companies not historically defined as an ESCO (e.g. mechanical contractors), (2) uncertainty among some potential customers about committing to long-term performance contracts, and (3) reduction of performance contracting’s perceived benefit of hedging energy price increases and variability due to customer expectations of continued low and less volatile energy prices.","Springer","","Lawrence Berkeley National Lab.

Microgrids that are able to island from the bulk electrical grid are one technology that may vastly improve electrical power service to customer loads. To achieve these improvements, an islanded microgrid should be able to operate through the loss of one of its generators without shedding electrical load. The loss of one generator will typically result in significant additional loads, including transient overloads, being placed on the remaining generators. There is also the possibility of additional generator tripping during these processes (i.e. cascading failures), which would likely result in the collapse of the microgrid. The novelty of our work consists in incorporating dynamic models of generator controllers into a microgrid optimal dispatch formulation with the ultimate goal to avoid operational failures and ensure the “survivability” of all-inverter microgrids to generator loss and transient overloads. The integration of generator and controller dynamics into the optimal dispatch formulation significantly increases the computational complexity. As we develop algorithms to restore speed of the optimization, our method can be readily implemented into a new operational strategy capable of an unprecedented level of reliability against generator contingencies. In addition, we quantitatively illustrate the effect of the survivability constraints on the microgrid operating costs and how the related trade-off between capital and operating costs should be taken into account at the design stage. Finally, the methods developed here also apply to the dispatch of off-grid microgrids.","Elsevier","","Los Alamos National Lab.

Unlike modeling a single building, which will use detailed information, UBEM generally uses existing building stock data consisting of high-level building information. This study evaluated the impacts of three zoning methods and the use of floor multipliers on the simulated energy use of 940 office and retail buildings in three climate zones using City Building Energy Saver. The first zoning method, OneZone, creates one thermal zone per floor using the target building's footprint. The second zoning method, AutoZone, splits the building's footprint into perimeter and core zones. A novel, pixel-based automatic zoning algorithm is developed for the AutoZone method. The third zoning method, Prototype, uses the U.S. Department of Energy's reference building prototype shapes. Results show that simulated source energy use of buildings with the floor multiplier are marginally higher by up to 2.6% than those modeling each floor explicitly, which take two to three times longer to run. Compared with the AutoZone method, the OneZone method results in decreased thermal loads and less equipment capacities: 15.2% smaller fan capacity, 11.1% smaller cooling capacity, 11.0% smaller heating capacity, 16.9% less heating loads, and 7.5% less cooling loads. Source energy use differences range from -7.6% to 5.1%. When comparing the Prototype method with the AutoZone method, source energy use differences range from -12.1% to 19.0%, and larger ranges of differences are found for the thermal loads and equipment capacities. This study demonstrated that zoning methods have a significant impact on the simulated energy use of UBEM. Finally, one recommendation resulting from this study is to use the AutoZone method with floor multiplier to obtain accurate results while balancing the simulation run time for UBEM.","Elsevier","","Lawrence Berkeley National Lab.

This paper analyzes measures to reduce both the energy consumption and carbon emissions in the production phase and use phase, providing a theoretical basis for a sustainable magnesia refractory industry. Results show that the total carbon emissions of carbon-containing magnesia bricks produced with fused magnesia are much higher than those of other products, and the total carbon emissions of both general magnesia brick and magnesia-carbon spray are lower than those of other products. Carbon emissions of magnesia products are mainly concentrated in the production process of magnesia. Manufacturers should select materials with lower environmental impacts and emphasize saving energy and reducing carbon emissions in the magnesia production process. Through scenario analysis we found that CO<sub>2</sub> capture is an effective measure to reduce carbon emissions compared with just improving energy consumption. However, a robust CO<sub>2</sub> market does not currently exist. Policy makers should plan on integrating CO<sub>2</sub> capture in the magnesia industry into a regional CO<sub>2</sub> capture and storage development planning in the long term. In particular, magnesia production is concentrated in a single geographical area which would and thus could take advantage of significant scale effects. Finally, in the use phase, extending the service lifetime reduces carbon emissions over the product lifetime, thus users should attempt to extend the service lifetime of a furnace as a whole. However, results show that it is not advisable to add a large number of repair refractories to extend the lifetime of existing furnaces.","Elsevier","","Los Alamos National Lab.

"Energy use and life cycle greenhouse gas emissions of drones for commercial package delivery","Stolaroff, Joshuah K.; Samaras, Constantine; O'Neill, Emma R.; Lubers, Alia; Mitchell, Alexandra S.; Ceperley, Daniel","32 ENERGY CONSERVATION, CONSUMPTION, AND UTILIZATION; Climate-change mitigation; Energy efficiency; Energy science and technology","Here, the use of automated, unmanned aerial vehicles (drones) to deliver commercial packages is poised to become a new industry, significantly shifting energy use in the freight sector. Here we find the current practical range of multi-copters to be about 4 km with current battery technology, requiring a new network of urban warehouses or waystations as support. We show that, although drones consume less energy per package-km than delivery trucks, the additional warehouse energy required and the longer distances traveled by drones per package greatly increase the life-cycle impacts. Still, in most cases examined, the impacts of package delivery by small drone are lower than ground-based delivery. Results suggest that, if carefully deployed, drone-based delivery could reduce greenhouse gas emissions and energy use in the freight sector. To realize the environmental benefits of drone delivery, regulators and firms should focus on minimizing extra warehousing and limiting the size of drones.","Nature Publishing Group","External Audience (Unlimited)","Lawrence Livermore National Lab.

"Techno-economic analysis of DC power distribution in commercial buildings","Vossos, Vagelis; Gerber, Daniel; Bennani, Youness; Brown, Richard; Marnay, Chris","24 POWER TRANSMISSION AND DISTRIBUTION; 32 ENERGY CONSERVATION, CONSUMPTION, AND UTILIZATION; Direct current; DC distribution; Techno-economic analysis; Commercial building; DC Microgrid","Improvements in building end-use efficiency have significantly reduced the energy intensity of new buildings, but diminishing returns make it a challenge to build very-low energy buildings cost-effectively. A largely untapped efficiency strategy is to improve the efficiency of power distribution within buildings. Direct current (DC) distribution with modern power electronics has the potential to eliminate much of the power conversion loss in alternating current (AC) building distribution networks that include photovoltaics and DC end uses. Previous literature suggests up to 15% energy savings from DC power distribution in very energy efficient buildings with onsite generation and battery storage. This paper extends prior energy modeling of DC versus AC distribution in buildings, to consider the cost of implementing DC systems on a life-cycle basis. A techno-economic analysis framework based on commercially available products that evaluates the cost-effectiveness of DC systems is presented. The analysis is conducted for three commercial building types in two California climate zones and for various PV and battery storage capacities. Monte Carlo simulation is used to compute the payback period and lifecycle cost savings of DC versus AC distribution systems. A future-market scenario is also examined, which evaluates how future efficiency improvements in power converters and changes in electricity tariffs may affect cost savings. This analysis shows that DC systems can be cost-effective in all scenarios that include large capacities of battery storage and onsite solar, whereas for systems without storage, DC distribution is generally not cost-effective.","Elsevier","","Lawrence Berkeley National Lab.

One of the predominant renewable energy sources, wind energy, possess a significant challenge for grid operations, due to its intermittency, uncertainty and variability. In changing operating conditions with wind uncertainty, part of wind may need to be curtailed for the safe utilization of the transmission system. In order to minimize the wind power curtailment and to keep the power flow on a transmission line under limits, a cyber resilient Distributed Remedial Action Scheme (DRAS) is developed in this paper. The RAS is formulated as an optimization problem, considering the real power flow constraints of the transmission lines and given wind variability. In this paper, DRAS is developed to operate even with failures in the computing nodes to make it cyber-resilient. Distributed simplex algorithm is used for optimization in the distributed RAS. The DRAS is implemented in a decentralized platform called Resilient Information Architecture Platform for Smart Grid (RIAPS) to enable cyber resiliency of DRAS. The effectiveness of the proposed approach is validated through offline simulations of the New England 39 bus system and online simulations of IEEE 14 bus test system. In conclusion, a cyber physical test bed utilizing Real Time Digital Simulator (RTDS), Phasor Measurement Units (PMUs), and BeagleBones has been used for the online simulation and validation of the developed cyber-resilient RAS.","IEEE","","Vanderbilt Univ., Nashville, TN (United States)","USDOE Advanced Research Projects Agency - Energy (ARPA-E)","","United States","2018-09-03T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: IEEE Transactions on Industry Applications; Journal Volume: 55; Journal Issue: 1","","Medium: ED; Size: p. 943-953","","DOE-VANDERBILT-0000666-24.pdf","AR0000666","Journal ID: ISSN 0093-9994","10.1109/TIA.2018.2868257","","2019-09-03T00:00:00Z","1483869","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/1483869","https://www.osti.gov/servlets/purl/1483869","IEEE Transactions on Industry Applications","1","55"
"A First Estimation of County-Based Green Water Availability and Its Implications for Agriculture and Bioenergy Production in the United States","Xu, Hui; Wu, May","54 ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCES; 32 ENERGY CONSERVATION, CONSUMPTION, AND UTILIZATION; water resources; rainwater; green water availability; management; effective rain; crop water demand","Green water is vital for the terrestrial ecosystem, but water resource assessment often focuses on blue water. In this study, we estimated green water availability for major crops (i.e., corn, soybean, and wheat) and all other users(e.g., forest, grassland, and ecosystem services) at the county level in the United States. We estimated green water resources from effective rain(ER) using three different methods: Smith, U.S. Department of Agriculture-Soil Conservation Service (USDA-SCS), and the NHD plus V2 dataset. The analysis illustrates that, if green water meets all crop water demands, the fraction of green water resources available to all other users varies significantly across regions, from the Northern Plains (0.71) to the Southeast (0.98). At the county level, this fraction varies from 0.23 to 1.0. Green water resources estimated using the three different ER methods present diverse spatiotemporal distribution patterns across regions, which could affect green water availability estimates. The water availability index for green water (WAI_R) was measured taking into account crop water demand and green water resources aggregated at the county level. Beyond these parameters, WAI_R also depends on the precipitation pattern, crop type and spatially differentiated regions. In addition, seasonal analysis indicated that WAI_R is sensitive to the temporal boundary of the analysis.","MDPI","","Argonne National Lab.

The loose ion exchange resin beads used in conventional electrodeionization were immobilized and molded to form a porous resin wafer material. In this study, the energy efficiency of brackish water desalination using resin wafer electrodeionization was evaluated along with salt removal ratio, current efficiency and productivity. Several key operating factors, including treatment time, applied electrical energy and feed flow rate were selected through experimental design. In addition, the removal rate constant in resin wafer electrodeionization was determined via a pseudo first-order kinetic model, and then correlated with operation parameters. Furthermore, the prediction models of the productivity and energy consumption were established using response surface methodology. Results suggest that resin wafer electrodeionization can improve energy efficiency to greater than 35% in comparison to reverse osmosis (normally ~12%) for impaired water desalination. The energy consumption of resin wafer electrodeionization was found to be 0.35–0.66 kWh/m3 with productivity of 20.1–44.7 L/hr/m2 (i.e., 5.3–11.8 gal/hr/m2) for brackish water desalination. Furthermore, a preliminary economic evaluation on impaired water desalination using resin wafer electrodeionization comparable to commercial reverse osmosis process was provided. It suggests that resin wafer electrodeionization offers the potential for an abundant source of fresh water from impaired water desalination at a cost-effective manner, which should be viewed as a crucial component in the portfolio of water supply options.","Elsevier","","Idaho National Lab.

"Building energy simulation coupled with CFD for indoor environment: A critical review and recent applications","Tian, Wei; Han, Xu; Zuo, Wangda; Sohn, Michael D.","32 ENERGY CONSERVATION, CONSUMPTION, AND UTILIZATION; Coupled simulation; Building energy simulation; Computational fluid dynamics","This paper presents a comprehensive review of the open literature on motivations, methods and applications of linking stratified airflow simulation to building energy simulation (BES). First, we reviewed the motivations for coupling prediction models for building energy and indoor environment. This review classified various exchanged data in different applications as interface data and state data, and found that choosing different data sets may lead to varying performance of stability, convergence, and speed for the co-simulation. Second, our review shows that an external coupling scheme is substantially more popular in implementations of co-simulation than an internal coupling scheme. The external coupling is shown to be generally faster in computational speed, as well as easier to implement, maintain and expand than the internal coupling. Third, the external coupling can be carried out in different data synchronization schemes, including static coupling and dynamic coupling. In comparison, the static coupling that performs data exchange only once is computationally faster and more stable than the dynamic coupling. However, concerning accuracy, the dynamic coupling that requires multiple times of data exchange is more accurate than the static coupling. Furthermore, the review identified that the implementation of the external coupling can be achieved through customized interfaces, middleware, and standard interfaces. The customized interface is straightforward but may be limited to a specific coupling application. The middleware is versatile and user-friendly but usually limited in data synchronization schemes. The standard interface is versatile and promising, but may be difficult to implement. Current applications of the co-simulation are mainly energy performance evaluation and control studies. Finally, we discussed the limitations of the current research and provided an overview for future research.","Elsevier","","Univ. of Colorado, Boulder, CO (United States); Lawrence Berkeley National Lab.

The survey instrument is grounded in an interdisciplinary framework that bridges the gap between building physics and social science environments on the energy- and comfort-related human-building interaction in the workspace. Outcomes of the survey questionnaire provide insights into four key learning objectives: (1) individual occupant's motivational drivers regarding interaction with shared building environmental controls (such as adjustable thermostats, operable windows, blinds and shades, and artificial lighting), (2) group dynamics such as perceived social norms, attitudes, and intention to share controls, (3) occupant perception of the ease of use and knowledge of how to operate control systems, and (4) occupant-perceived comfort, satisfaction, and productivity. The study attempts to identify climatic, cultural, and socio-demographic influencing factors, as well as to establish the validity of the survey instrument and robustness of outcomes for future studies. Also, the paper aims at illustrating why and how social science insights can bring innovative knowledge into the adoption of building technologies in shared contexts, thus enhancing perceived environmental satisfaction and effectiveness of personal indoor climate control in office settings and impacting office workers’ productivity and reduced operational energy costs.","Elsevier","","Lawrence Berkeley National Lab.

Using information on energy demand and energy use profiles, the problem is defined to preferentially use battery resources sourced from the grid over petroleum resources. We pose the general nonlinear optimal resource management problem over a predetermined route as a convex optimization problem using a reduced model of the vehicle. This problem is computationally efficient enough to be optimized “on the fly” on the on-board vehicle computer and is thus able to adapt to changing vehicle conditions in real time. Lastly, using this reduced model to generate control inputs for the detailed vehicle simulator autonomie, we record efficiency gains of over 10% as compared to the industry standard charge depleting charge sustaining controller over synthetic mixed urban-suburban routes.","IEEE","","SLAC National Accelerator Lab., Menlo Park, CA (United States)","USDOE","","United States","2018-08-23T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: IEEE Transactions on Vehicular Technology; Journal Volume: 67; Journal Issue: 11","","Medium: ED; Size: p. 10366-10377","","","AC02-76SF00515","Journal ID: ISSN 0018-9545","10.1109/tvt.2018.2866801","","2019-08-23T00:00:00Z","1490463","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/1490463","https://www.osti.gov/servlets/purl/1490463","IEEE Transactions on Vehicular Technology","11","67"
"Effective moisture penetration depth model for residential buildings: Sensitivity analysis and guidance on model inputs","Woods, Jason; Winkler, Jon","32 ENERGY CONSERVATION, CONSUMPTION, AND UTILIZATION; moisture buffering; effective moisture penetration depth; humidity; building energy modeling; moisture","Moisture buffering of building materials has a significant impact on the building's indoor humidity, and building energy simulations need to model this buffering to accurately predict the humidity. Researchers requiring a simple moisture-buffering approach typically rely on the effective-capacitance model, which has been shown to be a poor predictor of actual indoor humidity. This paper describes an alternative two-layer effective moisture penetration depth (EMPD) model and its inputs. While this model has been used previously, there is a need to understand the sensitivity of this model to uncertain inputs. In this paper, we use the moisture-adsorbent materials exposed to the interior air: drywall, wood, and carpet. We use a global sensitivity analysis to determine which inputs are most influential and how the model's prediction capability degrades due to uncertainty in these inputs. We then compare the model's humidity prediction with measured data from five houses, which shows that this model, and a set of simple inputs, can give reasonable prediction of the indoor humidity.","Elsevier","","National Renewable Energy Lab.

William","32 ENERGY CONSERVATION, CONSUMPTION, AND UTILIZATION; 37 INORGANIC, ORGANIC, PHYSICAL, AND ANALYTICAL CHEMISTRY; 08 HYDROGEN; Reforming; EGR; hydrogen; thermochemical recuperation","The use of fuel reformate from catalytic processes is known to have beneficial effects on the spark-ignited (SI) combustion process through enhanced dilution tolerance and decreased combustion duration, but in many cases reformate generation can incur a significant fuel penalty. Here, in this two-part investigation, we demonstrate that efficient catalytic fuel reforming can result in improved brake engine efficiency while maintaining stoichiometric exhaust under the right conditions. In part one of this investigation, we used a combination of thermodynamic equilibrium calculations and experimental fuel catalytic reforming measurements on an engine to characterize the best possible reforming performance and energetics over a range of equivalence ratios and O<sub>2</sub> concentrations. Ideally, one might expect the highest levels of thermochemical recuperation for the highest catalyst equivalence ratios. However, reforming under these conditions is highly endothermic, and the available enthalpy for reforming is constrained. Thus for relatively high equivalence ratios, more methane and less H<sub>2</sub> and CO are produced. Our experiments revealed that this suppression of H<sub>2</sub> and CO could be countered by adding small amounts of O<sub>2</sub>, yielding as much as 15 vol % H<sub>2</sub> at the catalyst outlet for 4 < Φ<sub>catalyst</sub> < 7 under quasi-steady-state conditions. Under these conditions the H<sub>2</sub> and CO yields were highest and there was significant water consumption, confirming the presence of steam reforming reactions. Analyses of the experimental catalyst measurements indicated the possibility of both endothermic and exothermic reaction stages and global reaction rates sufficient to enable the utilization of higher space velocities than those employed in our experiments. Finally, in a companion paper detailing part two of this investigation, we present results for the engine dilution tolerance and brake engine efficiency impacts of the reforming levels achieved.","American Chemical Society","","Oak Ridge National Lab.

"Field evaluation of performance of HVAC optimization system in commercial buildings","Granderson, Jessica; Lin, Guanjing; Singla, Rupam; Fernandes, Samuel; Touzani, Samir","32 ENERGY CONSERVATION, CONSUMPTION, AND UTILIZATION","Smart new building technologies that offer continuous dynamic optimization of Heating, Ventilation, and Air Conditioning (HVAC) control hold promise to advance building operations for efficiency and grid response. These technologies use data from the control system to determine the analytically optimal setpoints, and then write back the optimal setpoints into the control system to minimize system energy consumption or costs. There are limited studies documenting field validations of these technologies. This paper presents the results from a long-term field evaluation of a model-predictive HVAC optimization system that installed in four commercial buildings. Energy savings analysis was conducted based on pre/post submetered energy use. Across the cohort of evaluation sites, HVAC savings following the implementation of the optimization system were mixed, ranging from 0–9%. Analysis of site operational data showed that occupant comfort was neither positively nor negatively impacted. Key technology adoption considerations and recommendations are summarized in the paper. The technology performs best when HVAC systems are in good working condition, and can be exercised to achieve the full range of its optimized setpoints–however it may not provide extensive additional savings over cases where best practice sequences of operation and reset strategies are already comprehensively implemented.","Elsevier","","Lawrence Berkeley National Lab.

In this paper, we present a distributed control strategy to achieve synchronized operation of an islanded MG supported by multiple controllable distributed generators (DGs). The proposed method utilizes pinning-based consensus algorithm to ensure explicit coordination between magnitude, frequency and phase angle regulation, while ensuring proportional power sharing. System frequency is regulated by all the DGs in proportion to their capacity, while a selected DG eliminates the phase and magnitude regulation errors. Controller design criteria is based on small-signal stability analysis. Here, the proposed control strategy is implemented in hardware controllers and its effectiveness is demonstrated using a real-time hardware-in-the-loop MG testbed.","IEEE","","Vanderbilt Univ., Nashville, TN (United States)","USDOE Advanced Research Projects Agency - Energy (ARPA-E)","","United States","2018-07-31T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: IEEE Transactions on Smart Grid; Journal Volume: 10; Journal Issue: 4","","Medium: ED; Size: p. 4487 - 4496","","DOE-VANDERBILT-0000666-23.pdf","AR0000666","Journal ID: ISSN 1949-3053","10.1109/TSG.2018.2861679","","2020-05-05T00:00:00Z","1483868","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/1483868","https://www.osti.gov/servlets/purl/1483868","IEEE Transactions on Smart Grid","4","10"

Methane, a potent greenhouse gas that influences the chemistry of the atmosphere, can be emitted from different sources including leakage from NG infrastructure, transportation activities, end-use uncombusted NG, landfills and livestock. Although significant CH<sub>4</sub> leakage associated with aging local NG distribution systems in the U.S. has been reported, further investigation is required to study the role of this infrastructure component and other NG-related sources in atmospheric CH<sub>4</sub> enhancements in urban centers. In this study, neighborhood-scale mobile-based monitoring of potential CH<sub>4</sub> emissions associated with NG in the Greater Houston area (GHA) is reported. A novel dual-gas 3.337 μm interband cascade laser-based sensor system was developed and mobile-mode deployed for simultaneous CH<sub>4</sub> and ethane (C<sub>2</sub>H<sub>6</sub>) monitoring during a period of over 14 days, corresponding to ~ 90 hours of effective data collection during summer 2016. The sampling campaign covered ~ 250 road miles and was primarily concentrated on eight residential zones with distinct infrastructure age and NG usage levels. A moderate number of elevated CH<sub>4</sub> concentration events (37 episodes) with mixing ratios not exceeding 3.60 ppmv and associated with atmospheric background enhancements below 1.21 ppmv were observed during the field campaign. Source discrimination analyses based on the covariance between CH<sub>4</sub> and C<sub>2</sub>H<sub>6</sub> levels indicated the predominance of thermogenic sources (e.g., NG) in the elevated CH<sub>4</sub> concentration episodes. The volumetric fraction of C<sub>2</sub>H<sub>6</sub> in the sources associated with the thermogenic CH<sub>4</sub> spikes varied between 2.7 and 5.9%, concurring with the C<sub>2</sub>H<sub>6</sub> content in NG distributed in the GHA. Isolated CH<sub>4</sub> peak events with significantly higher C<sub>2</sub>H<sub>6</sub> enhancements (~11 %) were observed at industrial areas and locations with high density of petroleum and gas pipelines in the GHA, indicating potential variability in Houston’s thermogenic CH<sub>4</sub> sources.","Elsevier","","Rice Univ., Houston, TX (United States)","USDOE Advanced Research Projects Agency - Energy (ARPA-E)","","United States","2018-01-04T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: Atmospheric Environment (1994); Journal Volume: 176; Journal Issue: C","","Medium: ED; Size: p. 261-273","","DOE-MAXION-00538-13","AR0000538","Journal ID: ISSN 1352-2310; PII: S1352231018300013","10.1016/j.atmosenv.2018.01.001","","2021-07-26T00:00:00Z","1435611","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/1435611","https://www.osti.gov/servlets/purl/1435611","Atmospheric Environment (1994)","C","176"

"Development of a standard capture efficiency test method for residential kitchen ventilation","Kim, Yang-Seon; Walker, Iain S.; Delp, William W.","32 ENERGY CONSERVATION, CONSUMPTION, AND UTILIZATION; 54 ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCES","Cooking activities are a major source of indoor air pollutants. To control pollutants generated from cooking activities, a range hood is commonly used in residential kitchens. Several building codes require that a range hood be installed in new homes to control pollutants from cooking, and the required airflow rates for range hoods are specified by indoor air quality standards. However, airflow alone does not show how much of the cooking pollutants are exhausted by the range hood. A better metric to evaluate range hood indoor air quality performance is capture efficiency -- the fraction of contaminants emitted during cooking that are exhausted directly to the outside via the range hood. The current article summarizes the development of a range hood capture efficiency test method for use in laboratory testing and equipment rating.","Taylor & Francis","","Lawrence Berkeley National Lab.

The high capital costs of HRSs and the consequent high investment risk are deterring growth of the infrastructure needed to promote the deployment of FCEVs. Stations supplied by gaseous hydrogen will be necessary for FCEV deployment in both the near and long term. Here, the two-tier pressure consolidation method enhances gaseous HRSs in the following ways: (1) reduces the capital cost compared with conventional stations, as well as those operating according to the original pressure consolidation approach described by Elgowainy et al. (2014) [1], (2) minimizes pressure cycling of HRS supply storage relative to the original pressure consolidation approach; and (3) increases use of the station’s supply storage (or delivered tube-trailers) while maintaining higher state-of-charge vehicle fills.","Elsevier","","Argonne National Lab.

Although battery electric vehicles (BEVs) have drawbacks such as the limited range and charging inconvenience, technological progress has been presenting promising potential for electric taxis. Many cities around the world including New York City, USA are taking initiatives to replace gasoline taxis with plug-in electric vehicles. This study extracts ten variables from the trip data of the New York City yellow taxis to represent their spatial-temporal travel patterns in terms of driver-shift, travel demand and dwell, and examines the implications of these driving patterns on the BEV taxi feasibility. The BEV feasibility of a taxi is quantified as the percentage of occupied trips that can be completed by BEVs of a given driving range during a year. It is found that the currently deployed 280 public charging stations in New York City are far from sufficient to support a large BEV taxi fleet. However, adding merely 372 new charging stations at various locations where taxis frequently dwell can potentially make BEVs with 200- and 300-mile ranges feasible for more than half of the taxi fleet. Finally, the results also show that taxis with certain characteristics are more suitable for switching to BEV-200 or BEV-300, such as fewer daily shifts, fewer drivers assigned to the taxi, shorter daily driving distance, fewer daily dwells but longer dwelling time, and higher likelihood to dwell at the borough of Manhattan.","Elsevier","","Oak Ridge National Lab.

Here, we present a series of descriptive statistics and regression results, emphasizing those residents who were aware of their local project prior to construction. Sample weighting is employed to account for stratification and non-response. We find that a developer being open and transparent, a community being able to influence the outcome, and having a say in the planning process are all statistically significant predictors of a process perceived as being ‘fair,’ with an open and transparent developer having the largest effect. We also find developer transparency and ability to influence outcomes to have statistically significant relationships to a more positive attitude, with those findings holding when aesthetics, landscape, and wind turbine sound considerations are controlled for. The results indicate that jurisdictions might consider developing procedures, which ensure citizens are consulted and heard, and benchmarks or best practices for developer interaction with communities and citizens.","","","Lawrence Berkeley National Lab.

The VRF-OAP system refers to a heating, ventilation, and air conditioning (HVAC) system to complement a ventilation function, which is not provided in the VRF system. It is a system that supplies air indoors by heat treatment of outdoor air through the OAP, as a number of indoor units and OAPs are connected to the outdoor unit in the VRF system simultaneously. This paper conducted experiments with regard to changes in efficiency and the cooling capabilities of each unit and system according to supply air temperature in the OAP using a multicalorimeter. Based on these results, an algorithm that controlled the temperature of the supply air in the OAP was developed considering indoor and outdoor temperatures and humidity. The algorithm was applied in the test building to verify the effects of energy reduction and the effects on indoor temperature and humidity. Loads were then changed by adjusting the number of conditioned rooms to verify the effect of the algorithm according to various load conditions. In the field test results, the energy reduction effect was approximately 15–17% at a 100% load, and 4–20% at a 75% load. However, no significant effects were shown at a 50% load.

However, using additional variables in the form of multivariate time series data may provide more information in terms of extracting distinguishable features in the context of energy disaggregation. In this work, a novel probabilistic graphical modeling approach, namely the spatiotemporal pattern network (STPN) is proposed for energy disaggregation using multivariate time-series data. The STPN framework is shown to be capable of handling diverse types of multivariate time-series to improve the energy disaggregation performance. The technique outperforms the state of the art factorial hidden Markov models (FHMM) and combinatorial optimization (CO) techniques in multiple real-life test cases. Furthermore, based on two homes' aggregate electric consumption data, a similarity metric is defined for the energy disaggregation of one home using a trained model based on the other home (i.e., out-of-sample case). The proposed similarity metric allows us to enhance scalability via learning supervised models for a few homes and deploying such models to many other similar but unmodeled homes with significantly high disaggregation accuracy.","Elsevier","","National Renewable Energy Lab.

"Evaluation of scenario-specific modeling approaches to predict plane of array solar irradiation","Moslehi, Salim; Reddy, T. Agami; Katipamula, Srinivas","32 ENERGY CONSERVATION, CONSUMPTION, AND UTILIZATION; 14 SOLAR ENERGY","Predicting thermal or electric power output from solar collectors requires knowledge of solar irradiance incident on the collector, known as plane of array irradiance. In the absence of such a measurement, plane of array irradiation can be predicted using relevant transposition models which essentially requires diffuse (or beam) radiation to be to be known along with total horizontal irradiation. The two main objectives of the current study are (1) to evaluate the extent to which the prediction of plane of array irradiance is improved when diffuse radiation is predicted using location-specific regression models developed from on-site measured data as against using generalized models; and (2) to estimate the expected uncertainties associated with plane of array irradiance predictions under different data collection scenarios likely to be encountered in practical situations. These issues have been investigated using monitored data for several U.S. locations in conjunction with the Typical Meteorological Year, version 3 database. An interesting behavior in the Typical Meteorological Year, version 3 data was also observed in correlation patterns between diffuse and total radiation taken from different years which seems to attest to a measurement problem. Furthermore, the current study was accomplished under a broader research agenda aimed at providing energy managers the necessary tools for predicting, scheduling, and controlling various sub-systems of an integrated energy system.","Taylor & Francis","","Pacific Northwest National Lab.

"Measuring and predicting sooting tendencies of oxygenates, alkanes, alkenes, cycloalkanes, and aromatics on a unified scale","Das, Dhrubajyoti D.; John, Peter C.; McEnally, Charles S.; Kim, Seonah; Pfefferle, Lisa D.","09 BIOMASS FUELS; soot; biofuels; color ratio pyrometry; group contribution method; 32 ENERGY CONSERVATION, CONSUMPTION, AND UTILIZATION; 54 ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCES; 33 ADVANCED PROPULSION SYSTEMS","Databases of sooting indices, based on measuring some aspect of sooting behavior in a standardized combustion environment, are useful in providing information on the comparative sooting tendencies of different fuels or pure compounds. However, newer biofuels have varied chemical structures including both aromatic and oxygenated functional groups, which expands the chemical space of relevant compounds. In this work, we propose a unified sooting tendency database for pure compounds, including both regular and oxygenated hydrocarbons, which is based on combining two disparate databases of yield-based sooting tendency measurements in the literature. Unification of the different databases was made possible by leveraging the greater dynamic range of the color ratio pyrometry soot diagnostic. This unified database contains a substantial number of pure compounds (≥ 400 total) from multiple categories of hydrocarbons important in modern fuels and establishes the sooting tendencies of aromatic and oxygenated hydrocarbons on the same numeric scale for the first time. Then, using this unified sooting tendency database, we have developed a predictive model for sooting behavior applicable to a broad range of hydrocarbons and oxygenated hydrocarbons. The model decomposes each compound into single-carbon fragments and assigns a sooting tendency contribution to each fragment based on regression against the unified database. The model’s predictive accuracy (as demonstrated by leave-one-out cross-validation) is comparable to a previously developed, more detailed predictive model. The fitted model provides insight into the effects of chemical structure on soot formation, and cases where its predictions fail reveal the presence of more complicated kinetic sooting mechanisms. Our work will therefore enable the rational design of low-sooting fuel blends from a wide range of feedstocks and chemical functionalities.","Elsevier","","National Renewable Energy Lab.

"Demand Response for Thermal Fairness in District Heating Networks","Bhattacharya, Saptarshi; Chandan, Vikas; Arya, Vijay; Kar, Koushik","32 ENERGY CONSERVATION, CONSUMPTION, AND UTILIZATION; District Heating; Thermal Fairness; Demand Response; Optimization","District Heating (DH) networks are complex thermal grids wherein a centrally heated fluid is circulated through a network of pipes and heat exchangers to meet the heating needs of residential and commercial buildings. Several factors can lead to inefficient and unfair energy distribution among consumers in these networks. These include varying levels of building insulation, distance of individual buildings from the central energy source, and thermal losses in network pipes. Moreover, shortage of energy at the central energy source and extreme weather conditions can exacerbate these issues, leading to differing levels of thermal comfort and customer disgruntlement in the long run. In this paper, we propose and study a demand response scheme that attempts to ensure thermal fairness among energy consumers in modern thermal grids. We develop optimization formulations based on thermodynamic models of DH networks, which determine optimal energy flow for individual buildings in order to achieve thermal fairness across the network. Lastly, our numerical results using physics based models for DH networks show that it is indeed possible to achieve network level thermal fairness based objectives by controlling network parameters such as mass flow rates of water to the consumer premises and the supply water temperature.","IEEE","","Pacific Northwest National Lab.

Although the energy in the wastewater has been successfully utilized to condition buildings in other countries, it is barely utilized in the United States, until recently. In 2013, the Denver Museum of Nature & Science at Denver, the United States implemented a unique heat pump system that utilizes recycled wastewater from a municipal water system to cool and heat its 13,000 m<sup>2</sup> new addition. This recycled water heat pump (RWHP) system uses seven 105 kW (cooling capacity) modular water-to-water heat pumps (WWHPs). Each WWHP uses R-410A refrigerant, has two compressors, and can independently provide either 52 °C hot water (HW) or 7 °C chilled water (CHW) to the building. This paper presents performance characterization results of this RWHP system based on the measured data from December 2014 through August 2015. The annual energy consumption of the RWHP system was also calculated and compared with that of a baseline Heating, Ventilation, and Air Conditioning (HVAC) system which meets the minimum energy efficiencies that are allowed by American Society of Heating, Refrigerating and Air-Conditioning Engineers (ASHRAE) 90.1-2013. The performance analysis results indicate that recycled water temperatures were favorable for effective operation of heat pumps. As a result, on an annual basis, the RWHP system avoided 50% of source energy consumption (resulting from reduction in natural gas consumption although electricity consumption was increased slightly), reduced CO<sub>2</sub> emissions by 41%, and saved 34% in energy costs as compared with the baseline system.","MDPI AG","","Oak Ridge National Lab.

In this study, a bottom-up model is proposed to estimate residential energy demand using datasets that are commonly available in the United States. The model applies novel machine learning methods to match records in the Residential Energy Consumption Survey with Public Use Microdata samples.

"Efficient modeling of optically-complex, non-coplanar exterior shading: Validation of matrix algebraic methods","Wang, Taoning; Ward, Gregory; Lee, Eleanor S.","32 ENERGY CONSERVATION, CONSUMPTION, AND UTILIZATION; exterior shading; daylighting; solar heat gains; bidirectional scattering distribution function (BSDF); validation; building energy simulation tools; windows","It has long been established that shading windows with overhangs, fins, and other types of non-coplanar systems (NCS) is one of the most effective ways of controlling solar heat gains in buildings because they intercept solar radiation prior to entry into the building. Designers however often specify non-opaque materials (e.g., louvers, fritted glass, expanded metal mesh) for these systems in order to admit daylight, reduce lighting energy use, and improve indoor environmental quality. Most simulation tools rely on geometric calculations and radiosity methods to model the solar heat gain impacts of NCS and cannot model optically-complex materials or geometries. For daylighting analysis, optically-complex NCS can be modeled using matrix algebraic methods, although time-efficient parametric analysis has not yet been implemented. Determining the best design and/or material for static or operable NCS that minimize cooling, heating, and lighting energy use and peak demand requires an iterative process. This study describes and validates a matrix algebraic method that enables parametric energy analysis of NCS. Such capabilities would be useful not only for design but also for development of prescriptive energy-efficiency standards, rating and labeling systems for commercial products, development of design guidelines, and development of more optimal NCS technologies. A facade or “F” matrix, which maps the transfer of flux from the NCS to the surface of the window, is introduced and its use is explained. A field study was conducted in a full-scale outdoor testbed to measure the daylight performance of an operable drop-arm awning. Simulated data were compared to measured data in order to validate the models. Results demonstrated model accuracy: simulated workplane illuminance was within 11–13%, surface luminance was within 16–18%, and the daylight glare probability was within 6–9% of measured results. Methods used to achieve accurate results are discussed. Results of the validation of daylighting performance are applicable to solar heat gain performance. Since exterior shading can also significantly reduce peak demand, these models enable stakeholders to more accurately assess HVAC and lighting impacts in support of grid management and resiliency goals.","Elsevier","","Lawrence Berkeley National Lab.

This paper focuses on the possibility of extracting energy from minor tidal channels by using a hydrodynamic model to quantify the power potential and the associated impact on tidal circulation. The study site is a multi-inlet bay system connected by two narrow inlets, Agate Pass and Rich Passage, to the Main Basin of Puget Sound. A three-dimensional hydrodynamic model was applied to the study site and calibrated for tidal elevations and currents. We examined three energy extraction scenarios in which turbines were deployed in each of the two passages and concurrently in both. Extracted power rates and associated changes in tidal elevation, current, tidal flux, and residence time were examined. Maximum instantaneous power rates reached 250 kW, 1550 kW, and 1800 kW, respectively, for the three energy extraction scenarios. The model suggests that with the proposed level of energy extraction, the impact on tidal circulation is very small. It is worth investigating the feasibility of harnessing tidal energy from minor tidal channels of Puget Sound.","Elsevier","","Pacific Northwest National Lab.

"Integrated Electricity and Natural Gas Demand Response for Manufacturers in the Smart Grid","Dababneh, Fadwa; Li, Lin","32 ENERGY CONSERVATION, CONSUMPTION, AND UTILIZATION; Demand Response; Natural Gas and Electricity; Industrial Sector; Production Throughput","The Smart Grid opens many opportunities for electricity suppliers and customers to maintain grid stability, reduce electricity cost, and promote environmentally sustainable operation. Unfortunately, these benefits cannot be fully realized from industrial energy customers due to inadequate manufacturing decision-making methodology that cannot consider manufacturers and energy suppliers simultaneously. The influence manufacturers have on the grid comes from their large electricity demand contributing to peak power and their large natural gas usage due to the increasing dependency of the electricity sector on gas-fired generation. Nonetheless, the interdependency between manufacturers’ electricity and natural gas demand is not well studied in the literature. Hence, in this paper, an electricity and natural gas driven production scheduling model for manufacturers is established. The model considers time-based and event-based electricity and gas demand response. Here, a Modified Simulated Annealing algorithm is proposed to solve the problem in reaction to real-time supply notifications so that the interaction between manufacturers and energy providers is promoted. Numerical case studies are implemented and illustrate that 66-68% in energy cost savings for the manufacturer can be achieved when using the proposed model compared to baseline scenarios. Meanwhile, the Modified Simulated Annealing algorithm outperforms various solution methods in solving the proposed problem.","IEEE","","Univ. of Illinois, Chicago, IL (United States)","USDOE Office of Energy Efficiency and Renewable Energy (EERE)","","United States","2018-06-26T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: IEEE Transactions on Smart Grid; Journal Volume: 10; Journal Issue: 4","","Medium: ED; Size: p. 4164-4174","","","EE0007722","Journal ID: ISSN 1949-3053","10.1109/tsg.2018.2850841","","2022-05-16T00:00:00Z","1865616","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/1865616","https://www.osti.gov/servlets/purl/1865616","IEEE Transactions on Smart Grid","4","10"

This study aims to characterize ASR damage development in the mortar samples containing reactive glass aggregates and investigate the damage reduction effect of the waste supplementary cementitious materials (SCMs), including recycled glass powders and fly ash. The recycled glass aggregate mortar samples with/without SCMs were prepared in this study. The length change tests were first conducted with the prepared mortar samples based on the ASTM C1260 standard. The results demonstrated the added SCMs can largely decrease early-age ASR expansion rate. The optical microscope and Scanning Electron Microscope (SEM) with Energy Dispersive X-ray Spectroscopy (EDS) were further conducted to characterize the ASR damage in mortar samples and investigate the damage mitigation mechanism with added SCMs. The combined SEM imaging and chemical analysis indicated added SCMs can decrease both the alkali and calcium content of the generated ASR gel. In addition, the ASR damage development inside mortar samples were monitored with dynamic micron X-ray CT (μCT) over a reaction period of 63 hour at the temperature of 80°C. The scanning patterns demonstrated the ASR damage can be easily developed from the area with initial cracks and sharp corners. In conclusion, the images of glass power and fly ash samples showed significantly reduced ASR damage. This study showed that adding of SCMs can largely reduce ASR deterioration and thus facilitate the recycling glass particles into concrete.","Elsevier","","Argonne National Lab.

"Persistent and transient cost efficiency—an application to the Swiss hydropower sector","Filippini, Massimo; Geissmann, Thomas; Greene, William H.","32 ENERGY CONSERVATION, CONSUMPTION, AND UTILIZATION; 29 ENERGY PLANNING, POLICY, AND ECONOMY; 13 HYDRO ENERGY; Efficiency measurement; Stochastic frontier analysis; Persistent and transient cost efficiency; Hydropower","Electricity prices on the European market have decreased significantly over the past few years, resulting in a deterioration of Swiss hydropower firms’ competitiveness and profitability. One option to improve the sector’s competitiveness is to increase cost efficiency. The goal of this study is to quantify the level of persistent and transient cost efficiency of individual firms by applying the generalized true random effects (GTRE) model introduced by Colombi et al. (Journal of Productivity Analysis 42(2): 123–136, 2014) and Filippini and Greene (Journal of Productivity Analysis 45(2): 187–196, 2016). Applying this newly developed GTRE model to a total cost function, the level of cost efficiency of 65 Swiss hydropower firms is analyzed for the period between 2000 and 2013. A true random effects specification is estimated as a benchmark for the transient level of cost efficiency. The results show the presence of both transient as well as persistent cost inefficiencies. The GTREM predicts the aggregate level of cost inefficiency to amount to 21.8% (8.0% transient, 13.8% persistent) on average between 2000 and 2013. These two components differ in interpretation and implication. From an individual firm’s perspective, the two types of cost inefficiencies might require a firm’s management to respond with different improvement strategies. The existing level of persistent inefficiency could prevent the hydropower firms from adjusting their production processes to new market environments. From a regulatory point of view, the results of this study could be used in the scope and determination of the amount of financial support given to struggling firms.","Springer","","Pacific Northwest National Lab.

"Gradient boosting machine for modeling the energy consumption of commercial buildings","Touzani, Samir; Granderson, Jessica; Fernandes, Samuel","32 ENERGY CONSERVATION, CONSUMPTION, AND UTILIZATION","Accurate savings estimations are important to promote energy efficiency projects and demonstrate their cost-effectiveness. The increasing presence of advanced metering infrastructure (AMI) in commercial buildings has resulted in a rising availability of high frequency interval data. These data can be used for a variety of energy efficiency applications such as demand response, fault detection and diagnosis, and heating, ventilation, and air conditioning (HVAC) optimization. This large amount of data has also opened the door to the use of advanced statistical learning models, which hold promise for providing accurate building baseline energy consumption predictions, and thus accurate saving estimations. The gradient boosting machine is a powerful machine learning algorithm that is gaining considerable traction in a wide range of data driven applications, such as ecology, computer vision, and biology. In the present work an energy consumption baseline modeling method based on a gradient boosting machine was proposed. To assess the performance of this method, a recently published testing procedure was used on a large dataset of 410 commercial buildings. The model training periods were varied and several prediction accuracy metrics were used to evaluate the model's performance. The results show that using the gradient boosting machine model improved the R-squared prediction accuracy and the CV(RMSE) in more than 80 percent of the cases, when compared to an industry best practice model that is based on piecewise linear regression, and to a random forest algorithm.","Elsevier","","Lawrence Berkeley National Lab.

In regard to fast charging, it is generally understood that it is the kinetic overpotential at the graphite anode that limits the cycling rate in modern commercial battery formulations. Here, we study the fast-charging capabilities of a series of graphite samples from commercial suppliers, as part of a materials validation effort at Argonne National Laboratory. Lastly, we combine materials characterization data from the raw samples with electrochemical characterization of graphite laminate electrodes in full-cell configuration to explore the causes of differences in rate performance and its impact on cycle life.","Electrochemical Society","","Argonne National Lab.

By redefining the thermal efficiency, the Schofield method could be adapted to describe the flux without prior knowledge of membrane porosity, thickness, or thermal conductivity. A total of 17 commercially available membranes were analyzed in terms of flux and thermal efficiency to assess their suitability for application in MD. The thermal-efficiency based model described the flux with an average %RMSE of 4.5%, which was in the same range as the standard deviation on the measured flux. The redefinition of the thermal efficiency also enabled MD to be used as a novel thermal conductivity measurement device for thin porous hydrophobic films that cannot be measured with the conventional laser flash diffusivity technique.","Elsevier","","National Renewable Energy Lab.

"Towards the development of a standardized testing protocol for overhead island kitchen exhaust devices: Procedures, measurements and paths forward","Clark, Jordan D.; Rojas, Gabriel; Walker, Iain S.","32 ENERGY CONSERVATION, CONSUMPTION, AND UTILIZATION","Cooking is one of the most important sources of airborne pollutants in the indoor environments of residential buildings. Elevated concentrations of NO<sub>2</sub> due to cooking have been reported widely (Garret et al. 1998; Garrett et al. 1999; Mullen et al. 2016; Ryan et al. 1988; Schwab et al. 1994; J. Spengler et al. 1994; J. D. Spengler et al. 1983; Wilson et al. 1995). Many researchers have attributed elevated particulate concentrations to cooking, and some have attributed extremely high short-term concentrations of fine particles (>300 μg/m3) and ultrafine particles (>105 μg/m3) to cooking events (Abdullahi et al. 2013; Abt et al. 2000; Afshari et al. 2005; Buonanno et al. 2009; He et al. 2004; Kearney et al. 2011; Lance A.

A.","32 ENERGY CONSERVATION, CONSUMPTION, AND UTILIZATION; 29 ENERGY PLANNING, POLICY, AND ECONOMY; District heating and cooling; Exergy analysis; Heat pumps; Urban buildings; Modelica","In this study, we evaluate an ambient, bidirectional thermal network, which uses a single circuit for both district heating and cooling. When in net more cooling is needed than heating, the system circulates from a central plant in one direction. When more heating is needed, the system circulates in the opposite direction. A large benefit of this design is that buildings can recover waste heat from each other directly. We analyze the thermodynamic performance of the bidirectional system. Because the bidirectional system represents the state-of-the-art in design for district systems, its peak energy efficiency represents an upper bound on the thermal performance of any district heating and cooling system. However, because any network has mechanical and thermal distribution losses, we develop a diversity criterion to understand when the bidirectional system may be a more energy-efficient alternative to modern individual-building systems. We show that a simple model of a low-density, high-distribution loss network is more efficient than aggregated individual buildings if there is at least 1 unit of cooling energy per 5.7 units of simultaneous heating energy (or vice versa). We apply this criterion to reference building profiles in three cities to look for promising clusters.","Elsevier","","Lawrence Berkeley National Lab.

"Food Service Building Asset Rating Methodology and Analysis","Goel, Supriya; Gonzalez Matamoros, Juan; Vlachokostas, Alex; Wang, Nora","32 ENERGY CONSERVATION, CONSUMPTION, AND UTILIZATION","Food Service buildings are extremely energy intensive, using about 5 to 7 times more energy per square foot than conventional commercial buildings. Energy intensive commercial kitchen appliances are the primary drivers, often necessitating high exhaust air requirements. Currently, no standardized method exists to directly compare energy efficiency between different Food Service buildings. Different restaurant types have various types of appliances and cooked food throughput requirements and thus it is challenging to make direct comparisons. Past attempts to categorize Food Service use types into “Quick-Service” and “Full-Service” led to the development of the Standard 90.1 prototype building models. However, these models do not address the highly diverse Food Service use types. This paper proposes a methodology to compare Food Service buildings through an asset rating system. By identifying all unique systems in a kitchen and creating a common baseline, this methodology identifies approaches for normalizing variations in kitchen requirements and to compare all Food Service buildings against one another.","American Society of Heating, Refrigerating and Air-Conditioning Engineers","","Pacific Northwest National Lab.

Here we explore the possible consequences of these impacts for the electricity supply sector at the global scale. Regional hydropower projections are developed by forcing a coupled global hydrological and dam model with downscaled, bias-corrected climate realizations. Consequent impacts on power sector composition and associated emissions and investment costs are explored using the Global Change Assessment Model (GCAM). We find that climate-driven changes in hydropower generation may shift power demands onto and away from carbon intensive technologies. This then causes significantly altered power sector CO<sub>2</sub> emissions in several hydro-dependent regions, although the net global impact is modest. For drying regions, we estimate a global, cumulative investment need of approximately one trillion dollars (±$500 billion) this century to make up for deteriorated hydropower generation caused by climate change. Total investments avoided are of a similar magnitude across regions projected to experience increased precipitation. Investment risks and opportunities are concentrated in hydro-dependent countries for which significant climate change is expected. Various countries throughout the Balkans, Latin America and Southern Africa are most vulnerable, whilst Norway, Canada, and Bhutan emerge as clear beneficiaries.","Elsevier","","Pacific Northwest National Lab.

The loose ion exchange resin beads used in conventional electrodeionization were immobilized and molded to form a porous resin wafer material. In this study, the energy efficiency of brackish water desalination using resin wafer electrodeionization was evaluated along with salt removal ratio, current efficiency and productivity. Several key operating factors, including treatment time, applied electrical energy and feed flow rate were selected through experimental design. Additionally, the removal rate constant in resin wafer electrodeionization was determined via a pseudo first-order kinetic model, and then correlated with operation parameters. Furthermore, the prediction models of the productivity and energy consumption were established using response surface methodology. Results suggest that resin wafer electrodeionization can improve energy efficiency to greater than 35% in comparison to reverse osmosis (normally ~12%) for impaired water desalination. The energy consumption of resin wafer electrodeionization was found to be 0.35–0.66 kWh/m<sup>3</sup> with productivity of 20.1–44.7 L/hr/m<sup>2</sup> (i.e., 5.3–11.8 gal/hr/m<sup>2</sup>) for brackish water desalination. Furthermore, a preliminary economic evaluation on impaired water desalination using resin wafer electrodeionization comparable to commercial reverse osmosis process was provided. It suggests that resin wafer electrodeionization offers the potential for an abundant source of fresh water from impaired water desalination at a cost-effective manner, which should be viewed as a crucial component in the portfolio of water supply options.","Elsevier","","Idaho National Lab.

This framework aims to provide charging strategies, i.e. the choice of charging station and the amount of charged energy, by considering constraints from personal daily itineraries and existing charging infrastructure. A data-driven method is introduced to establish a stochastic energy consumption prediction model with consideration of realistic uncertainties. This is performed by analyzing a large scale electric vehicle data set. A real-time updating method is designed to construct this prediction model from new consecutive data points in an adaptive way for real-world applications. Based on this energy cost prediction framework from real electric vehicle data, multistage optimal charging decision making models are introduced, including a deterministic model for average outcome decision making and a robust model for safest charging strategies. A dynamic programming algorithm is proposed to find the optimal charging strategies. Detailed simulations and case studies demonstrate the performance of the proposed algorithms to find optimal charging strategies. They also show the potential capability of connected and automated electric vehicles to reduce the range anxiety and charging infrastructure dependency.","Elsevier","","Idaho National Lab.

Traditional building retrofits focus on equipment upgrades, often at the end of equipment life or failure, and result in replacement with marginally improved similar technology and limited energy savings. The Integrated System (IS) retrofit approach enables much greater energy savings by leveraging interactive effects between end use systems, enabling downsized or lower energy technologies. This work presents a case study in Hawaii quantifying the benefits of an IS retrofit approach compared to two traditional retrofit approaches: a Standard Practice of upgrading equipment to meet minimum code requirements, and an Improved Practice of upgrading equipment to a higher efficiency. The IS approach showed an energy savings of 84% over existing building energy use, much higher than the traditional approaches of 13% and 33%. The IS retrofit also demonstrated the greatest energy cost savings potential. While the degree of savings realized from the IS approach will vary by building and climate, these findings indicate that savings on the order of 50% and greater are not possible without an IS approach. It is therefore recommended that the IS approach be universally adopted to achieve deep energy savings.","Elsevier","","Lawrence Berkeley National Lab.

"Bidirectional low temperature district energy systems with agent-based control: Performance comparison and operation optimization","Bunning, Felix; Wetter, Michael; Fuchs, Marcus; Muller, Dirk","32 ENERGY CONSERVATION, CONSUMPTION, AND UTILIZATION; Low temperature network; District heating; Urban energy systems; Operation optimization; Modelica; Agent-based control","Bidirectional low temperature networks are a novel concept that promises more efficient heating and cooling of buildings. Early research shows theoretical benefits in terms of exergy efficiency over other technologies. Pilot projects indicate that the concept delivers good performance if heating and cooling demands are diverse. However, the operation of these networks is not yet optimized and there is no quantification of the benefits over other technologies in various scenarios. Moreover, there is a lack of understanding of how to integrate and control multiple distributed heat and cold sources in such networks. Thus, this paper develops a control concept based on a temperature set point optimization and agent-based control which allows the modular integration of an arbitrary number of sources and consumers. Afterwards, the concept is applied to two scenarios representing neighborhoods in San Francisco and Cologne with different heating and cooling demands and boundary conditions. The performance of the system is then compared to other state-of-the-art heating and cooling solutions using dynamic simulations with Modelica. The results show that bidirectional low temperature networks without optimization produce 26% less emissions in the San Francisco scenario and 63% in the Cologne scenario in comparison to the other heating and cooling solutions. Savings of energy costs are 46% and 27%, and reductions of primary energy consumption 52% and 72%, respectively. The presented operation optimization leads to electricity use reductions of 13% and 41% when compared to networks with free-floating temperature control and the results indicate further potential for improvement. The study demonstrates the advantage of low temperature networks in different situations and introduces a control concept that is extendable for real implementation.","Elsevier","","Lawrence Berkeley National Lab.

"Optimal feed flow sequence for multi-effect distillation system integrated with supercritical carbon dioxide Brayton cycle for seawater desalination","Sharan, Prashant; Neises, Ty; Turchi, Craig","32 ENERGY CONSERVATION, CONSUMPTION, AND UTILIZATION; multi-effect distillation; supercritical carbon dioxide; Brayton cycle; brine recycling; process integration","Multi-effect distillation is often integrated with a Rankine power cycle for cogeneration (simultaneous production of power and desalinated water). Such integration increases the condenser operating pressure for the Rankine cycle (and increases the heat-rejection temperature) to produce desalinated water, resulting in decreased power-plant efficiency. The supercritical carbon dioxide Brayton cycle has a higher efficiency compared to the Rankine cycle. The waste heat rejected from supercritical carbon dioxide Brayton cycle is at sufficiently hot temperature to have feasible energy integration with multi-effect distillation system. The paper introduces the novel concept of cogeneration without being a parasitic load to the power cycle. For the illustrative example considered, integrating 4-effect distillation system with a 115 MWe power plant can produce 3041 m3 of distillate per day at 1.06 $/m3, at a constant power plant efficiency of 49.2%. The pattern in which feed enters the desalination system often dictates its energy consumption. The two most commonly used feed configurations for multi-effect distillation system are parallel/cross feed and forward feed. With steam as a heat source (i.e., a latent heat source), parallel/cross feed is the most energy-efficient feed configuration. The other objective of this paper is to identify the optimal feed flow configuration for multi-effect distillation system integrated with a supercritical carbon dioxide power cycle (i.e., a sensible heat source). For the simplified network, forward feed is the best feed configuration, which yields a 7.5% increase in distillate production at 2.6% reduced distillate cost. Additionally, different methods for reducing the brine discharge are studied, which can help to achieve zero liquid discharge. Result show increasing the maximum brine concentration gives superior results compared to brine recycling. The system modelling is done using the principle of process integration, and an analytical methodology for cogeneration is derived.","Elsevier","","National Renewable Energy Lab.

Hydrogen refueling stations premdominantly use electrolyzer systems to generate hydrogen, and are proposed to have the potential of becoming smarter loads which can pro-actively provide grid services. Based on experimental findings electrolyzer systems are observed to have a high level of controllability and hence can add flexibility to the grid from demand side. Greater awareness and controllability is proposed, developed, implemented, and tested by a 'frond end controller' in real-time environment. It can optimize the operation of electrolyzer systems based on the information collected by a communication module. Real-time tests are performed to verify the performance of front end controller driven electrolyzers to provide grid support that enables greater economic revenue and grid support for hydrogen producers under dynamic conditions. The front end controller proposed in this paper is tested with electrolyzers, however it is proposed as a generic control topology that is applicable to any load.","MDPI AG","","National Renewable Energy Lab.

Disagreements have arisen over the global greenhouse gas reductions associated with replacing coal with wood, and groups on both sides of the Atlantic Ocean have raised concerns that increasing biomass exports might negatively affect SE US forests and the ecosystem services they provide. We use the telecoupling framework to test assertions that the intended benefits of the wood pellet trade for Europe might be offset by negative consequences in the SE US. Through a review of current literature and available data sets, we characterize the observed and potential changes in the environmental, social, and economic components of the sending and receiving regions to assess the overall sustainability of this renewable energy system. We conclude that the observed transatlantic wood pellet trade is an example of a mutually beneficial telecoupled system with the potential to provide environmental and socioeconomic benefits in both the SE US and Europe despite some negative effects on the coal industry. We recommend continued monitoring of this telecoupled system to quantify the environmental, social, and economic interactions and effects in the sending, receiving, and spillover systems over time so that evidence-based policy decisions can be made with regard to the sustainability of this renewable energy pathway.","Resilience Alliance","","Oak Ridge National Lab.

To accomplish this, a mature thermophysical modeling software, EnergyPlus<sup>TM</sup>, was modified for ship-related applications. This software, originally developed for use in whole-building energy consumption studies, is a free and open-source simulation program that has been used for more than two decades. The team evaluated the accuracy of the modified version of EnergyPlus by comparing results to direct measurements taken over a 6-week underway period onboard the Maritime Administration's Training Ship Kennedy. The team developed an energy model of a prescribed area of the ship and compared its performance to measured results obtained from 235 sensor points. EnergyPlus behaved well with respect to solar loading and convective heat transfer to seawater while the ship was underway. However, results suggest that additional work remains to accurately simulate seawater heat transfer while the ship is stationary.","American Society of Naval Engineers","","National Renewable Energy Lab.

"Corporate Delivery of a Global Smart Buildings Program","Fernandes, Samuel; Granderson, Jessica; Singla, Rupam; Touzani, Samir","32 ENERGY CONSERVATION, CONSUMPTION, AND UTILIZATION","Buildings account for about 40 percent of the total energy consumption in the U.S. and emit approximately one third of greenhouse gas emissions. But they also offer tremendous potential for achieving significant greenhouse gas reductions with the right savings strategies. With an increasing amount of data from buildings and advanced computational and analytical abilities, buildings can be made “smart” to optimize energy consumption and occupant comfort. Smart buildings are often characterized as having a high degree of data and system integration, connectivity and control, as well as the advanced use of data analytics. These “smarts” can enable up to 10–20% savings in a building, and help ensure that they persist over time. In 2009, Microsoft Corporation launched the Energy-Smart Buildings (ESB) program with a vision to improve building operations services, security and accessibility in services, and new tenant applications and services that improve productivity and optimize energy use. The ESB program focused on fault diagnostics, advanced analytics and new organizational processes and practices to support their operational integration. In addition to the ESB program, Microsoft undertook capital improvement projects that made effective use of a utility incentive program and lab consolidations over the same duration. The ESB program began with a pilot at Microsoft's Puget Sound campus that identified significant savings of up to 6–10% in the 13 pilot buildings. The success of the pilot led to a global deployment of the program. Between 2009 and 2015, there was a 23.7% reduction in annual electricity consumption (kWh) at the Puget Sound campus with 18.5% of that resulting from the ESB and lab consolidations. This article provides the results of research conducted to assess the best-practice strategies that Microsoft implemented to achieve these savings, including the fault diagnostic routines that are the foundation of the ESB program and organizational change management practices. It also presents the process that was adopted to scale the ESB program globally. We conclude with recommendations for how these successes can be generalized and replicated by other corporate enterprises.","","","Lawrence Berkeley National Lab.

"A cross-sectional study of the temporal evolution of electricity consumption of six commercial buildings","Pickering, Ethan M.; Hossain, Mohammad A.; Mousseau, Jack P.; Swanson, Rachel A.; French, Roger H.; Abramson, Alexis R.","32 ENERGY CONSERVATION, CONSUMPTION, AND UTILIZATION","Current approaches to building efficiency diagnoses include conventional energy audit techniques that can be expensive and time consuming. In contrast, virtual energy audits of readily available 15-minute-interval building electricity consumption are being explored to provide quick, inexpensive, and useful insights into building operation characteristics. A cross sectional analysis of six buildings in two different climate zones provides methods for data cleaning, population-based building comparisons, and relationships (correlations) of weather and electricity consumption. Data cleaning methods have been developed to categorize and appropriately filter or correct anomalous data including outliers, missing data, and erroneous values (resulting in < 0.5% anomalies). The utility of a cross-sectional analysis of a sample set of building's electricity consumption is found through comparisons of baseload, daily consumption variance, and energy use intensity. Correlations of weather and electricity consumption 15-minute interval datasets show important relationships for the heating and cooling seasons using computed correlations of a Time-Specific-Averaged- Ordered Variable (exterior temperature) and corresponding averaged variables (electricity consumption)(TSAOV method). The TSAOV method is unique as it introduces time of day as a third variable while also minimizing randomness in both correlated variables through averaging. This study found that many of the pair-wise linear correlation analyses lacked strong relationships, prompting the development of the new TSAOV method to uncover the causal relationship between electricity and weather. We conclude that a combination of varied HVAC system operations, building thermal mass, plug load use, and building set point temperatures are likely responsible for the poor correlations in the prior studies, while the correlation of time-specific-averaged-ordered temperature and corresponding averaged variables method developed herein adequately accounts for these issues and enables discovery of strong linear pair-wise correlation R values. TSAOV correlations lay the foundation for a new approach to building studies, that mitigates plug load interferences and identifies more accurate insights into weather-energy relationship for all building types. Over all six buildings analyzed the TSAOV method reported very significant average correlations per building of 0.94 to 0.82 in magnitude. Our rigorous statistics-based methods applied to 15- minute-interval electricity data further enables virtual energy audits of buildings to quickly and inexpensively inform energy savings measures.","Public Library of Science","","Case Western Reserve Univ., Cleveland, OH (United States)","USDOE Advanced Research Projects Agency - Energy (ARPA-E)","","United States","2017-10-31T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: PLoS ONE; Journal Volume: 12; Journal Issue: 10","","Medium: ED; Size: Article No. e0187129","","","AR0000668","Journal ID: ISSN 1932-6203","10.1371/journal.pone.0187129","","2021-12-31T00:00:00Z","1417016","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/1417016","https://www.osti.gov/servlets/purl/1417016","PLoS ONE","10","12"

Aggressive scaling of this active layer thickness is critical toward reducing the operating current, voltage, and energy consumption in filamentary-type memristors. Previously, the thickness of this filament layer has been limited to above a few nanometers due to processing constraints, making it challenging to further suppress the on-state current and the switching voltage. In this paper, the formation of conductive filaments in a material medium with sub-nanometer thickness formed through the oxidation of atomically thin two-dimensional boron nitride is studied. The resulting memristive device exhibits sub-nanometer filamentary switching with sub-pA operation current and femtojoule per bit energy consumption. Furthermore, by confining the filament to the atomic scale, current switching characteristics are observed that are distinct from that in thicker medium due to the profoundly different atomic kinetics. The filament morphology in such an aggressively scaled memristive device is also theoretically explored. Finally, these ultralow energy devices are promising for realizing femtojoule and sub-femtojoule electronic computation, which can be attractive for applications in a wide range of electronics systems that desire ultralow power operation.","Wiley","","Brookhaven National Lab.

"Extracting Natural Biosurfactants from Humus Deposits for Subsurface Engineering Applications","Wan, Jiamin; Tokunaga, Tetsu K.; Dong, Wenming; Kim, Yongman","58 GEOSCIENCES; 42 ENGINEERING; 32 ENERGY CONSERVATION, CONSUMPTION, AND UTILIZATION","Environmentally benign, economical, and effective surfactants and additives are needed in engineering subsurface energy recovery processes. Biosurfactants have some advantages over chemically synthesized surfactants, but the high costs of microbial-biosynthesis limit their applications in subsurface engineering. In this work, we propose to use naturally occurring biosurfactants contained within Earth's readily available and inexpensive humus deposits for subsurface engineering applications. We collected humus samples of different types from four different regions, and developed a simple method for extracting natural biosurfactant (NBS) using only four common chemicals. The average NBS extraction yields are 16 ± 3% of the raw humus. No significant differences in elemental composition and functional group chemistry were found among the NBS extracted from humus of different origins, suggesting that any humus deposit can be used for NBS extraction. Measurements of interfacial tensions between air-water and supercritical (sc) CO<sub>2</sub>-water interfaces indicate that the NBS is a highly effective surfactant. NBS has good foaming ability. Preliminary tests with only 0.5 mass % NBS in the aqueous phase (no other additives) yielded scCO<sub>2</sub>-in-water foams of 83% foam quality. The apparent viscosity of 13 cP measured at a shear rate of 2320 s<sup>-1</sup> indicates that much higher viscosities are achievable at lower shear rates. Finally, these results suggest that NBS merits further research and development for potential applications in subsurface energy production.","American Chemical Society (ACS)","","Lawrence Berkeley National Lab.

This paper presents the detailed procedures for model calibration of a VRF system with a dedicated outdoor air system (DOAS) by comparing to detailed measured data from an occupancy emulated small office building. The building energy model is first developed based on as-built drawings, and building and system characteristics available. The whole building energy modeling tool used for the study is U.S. DOE’s EnergyPlus version 8.1. The initial model is, then, calibrated with the hourly measured data from the target building and VRF-DOAS system. In a detailed calibration procedures of the VRF-DOAS, the original EnergyPlus source code is modified to enable the modeling of the specific VRF-DOAS installed in the building. After a proper calibration during cooling and heating seasons, the VRF-DOAS model can reasonably predict the performance of the actual VRF-DOAS system based on the criteria from ASHRAE Guideline 14-2014. The calibration results show that hourly CV-RMSE and NMBE would be 15.7% and 3.8%, respectively, which is deemed to be calibrated. As a result, the whole-building energy usage after calibration of the VRF-DOAS model is 1.9% (78.8 kWh) lower than that of the measurements during comparison period.","Elsevier","","Oak Ridge National Lab.

It is crucial to reduce building energy consumption in order to preserve energy resources and mitigate global climate change. Building performance simulations have been widely used for the estimation and optimization of building performance, providing reference values for the assessment of building energy consumption and the effects of energy-saving technologies. Among the various factors influencing building energy consumption, occupant behavior has drawn increasing attention. Occupant behavior includes occupant presence, movement, and interaction with building energy devices and systems. However, there are gaps in occupant behavior modeling as different energy modelers have employed varied data and tools to simulate occupant behavior, therefore producing different and incomparable results. Aiming to address these gaps, the International Energy Agency (IEA) Energy in Buildings and Community (EBC) Programme Annex 66 has established a scientific methodological framework for occupant behavior research, including data collection, behavior model representation, modeling and evaluation approaches, and the integration of behavior modeling tools with building performance simulation programs. Annex 66 also includes case studies and application guidelines to assist in building design, operation, and policymaking, using interdisciplinary approaches to reduce energy use in buildings and improve occupant comfort and productivity.

However, the problems of high cost and limited range associated with on-board batteries have substantially limited the popularity of battery electric buses. The technology of dynamic wireless power transfer (DWPT), which provides bus operators with the ability to charge buses while in motion, may be able to effectively alleviate the drawbacks of electric buses. In this paper, we address the problem of simultaneously selecting the optimal location of the DWPT facilities and designing the optimal battery sizes of electric buses for a DWPT electric bus system. The problem is first constructed as a deterministic model in which the uncertainty of energy consumption and travel time of electric buses is neglected. The methodology of robust optimization (RO) is then adopted to address the uncertainty of energy consumption and travel time. The affinely adjustable robust counterpart (AARC) of the deterministic model is developed, and its equivalent tractable mathematical programming is derived. Both the deterministic model and the robust model are demonstrated with a real-world bus system. The results of our study demonstrate that the proposed deterministic model can effectively determine the allocation of DWPT facilities and the battery sizes of electric buses for a DWPT electric bus system; and the robust model can further provide optimal designs that are robust against the uncertainty of energy consumption and travel time for electric buses.","Elsevier","","Pacificorp, Portland, OR (United States)","USDOE Office of Energy Efficiency and Renewable Energy (EERE); USDOT; Mountain-Plains Consortium (MPC)","","United States","2017-10-01T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: Transportation Research Part C: Emerging Technologies; Journal Volume: 83; Journal Issue: C","","Medium: ED; Size: p. 77-103","","","EE0007997","Journal ID: ISSN 0968-090X; PII: S0968090X17301985","10.1016/j.trc.2017.07.013","","2021-08-30T00:00:00Z","1429115","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/1429115","https://www.osti.gov/servlets/purl/1429115","Transportation Research Part C: Emerging Technologies","C","83"

"Personal thermal management using portable thermoelectrics for potential building energy saving","Zhao, Dongliang; Lu, Xing; Fan, Tianzhu; Wu, Yuen Shing; Lou, Lun; Wang, Qiuwang; Fan, Jintu; Yang, Ronggui","32 ENERGY CONSERVATION, CONSUMPTION, AND UTILIZATION; personal thermal management; building energy saving; thermoelectrics","Heating and cooling of buildings consume approximately 15% of all energy used in the United States. Such a large energy demand is primarily due to heating and cooling of the entire building space to temperature setpoints usually between 21.1 degrees C (70 degrees F) and 23.9 degrees C (75 degrees F). However, even with such a narrow range of temperature setpoints, more than 20% of the occupants do not feel thermally comfortable due to individual differences (e.g. age, gender, clothing, or physiology). The personal thermal management techniques, which create a local thermal envelope around a human body instead of heating or cooling the entire building space, have the potential to greatly reduce the building energy consumption and to enhance thermal comfort of individuals. In this study, a portable thermoelectric energy conversion unit (TECU) that converts electricity into cooling and heating energy is developed. The TECU supplies cool air (in the cooling mode) or warm air (in the heating mode) to regulate the thermal comfort of a human body. The cool or warm air is supplied through a tree-like rubber tube network that is knitted into a thermoregulatory undergarment. To achieve a cooling/heating target that provides satisfactory thermal comfort, the required cooling/heating power supply from the TECU is determined first while a theoretical model is then developed to guide the design of the TECU. To minimize the TECU weight and make it suitable for portable applications, relationships between weight and thermal resistances of commercial off-the-shelf heat sinks are established first, and a method to find the minimal weight of heat sinks for the TECU is then developed. This methodology is also applicable for other applications where heat sink weight needs to be minimized. The thermal manikin tests demonstrate that 24.6 W of personal cooling power and 18.5 W of personal heating power are achieved by using the TECU.","Elsevier","","National Renewable Energy Lab.

In so doing, we identified major factors that affect PCU cost and energy use. The hydrogen precooling energy intensity depends strongly on the station utilization rate, but approaches 0.3 kWh<sub>e</sub>/kg-H<sub>2</sub> at full utilization. In early fuel cell electric vehicle markets where utilization of the refueling capacity is low, the overhead cooling load (to keep the heat exchanger cold at -40°C) results in significantly high PCU energy intensity because only a small amount of hydrogen is being dispensed. We developed a parameterized precooling energy intensity prediction formula as a function of the ambient temperature and station utilization rate. We also found that the Joule-Thomson effect of the flow control device introduces a significant increase in temperature upstream of the PCU’s heat exchanger (HX), which impacts the PCU design capacity. An optimal PCU (per dispenser, at 35°C HX inlet temperature) consists of a 13-kW refrigerator and a HX with 1400 kg of thermal mass (aluminum), which currently costs $70,000 (uninstalled). Finally, the total (installed) capital and operation cost of PCU at a fully utilized hydrogen refueling station adds $0.50/kg-H<sub>2</sub>.","Elsevier","","Argonne National Lab.

In this paper, heat-related grid stress and the relationship with weather conditions were examined using data from the eastern United States. Penalized logistic regression models were developed and applied to predict stress on the electric grid using weather data. The inclusion of other weather variables, such as precipitation, in addition to temperature improved model performance. Several candidate models and combinations of predictive variables were examined. A penalized logistic regression model which was fit at the operation-zone level was found to provide predictive value and interpretability. Additionally, the importance of different weather variables observed at various time scales were examined. Maximum temperature and precipitation were identified as important across all zones while the importance of other weather variables was zone specific.

These urban scale reduced-order models rely on the contribution of influential variables to the internal, external, and system thermal loads. OpenStudio Application Programming Interface (API) serves as a tool to automate the process of model creation and demonstrate the developed framework. The results of this study show that the accuracy of the developed reduced-order building energy models varies only up to 10% with the selection of different thermal zones. In addition, to assess complexity of the developed reduced-order building energy models, this study develops a novel framework to quantify complexity of the building energy models. Consequently, this study empowers the building energy modelers to quantify their building energy model systematically in order to report the model complexity alongside the building energy model accuracy. An exhaustive analysis on four university campuses suggests that the urban neighborhood buildings lend themselves to simplified typical shapes. Specifically, building energy modelers can utilize the developed typical shapes to represent more than 80% of the U.S. buildings documented in the CBECS database. One main benefits of this developed framework is the opportunity for different models including airflow and solar radiation models to share the same exterior representation, allowing a unifying exchange data. Altogether, the results of this study have implications for a large-scale modeling of buildings in support of urban energy consumption analyses or assessment of a large number of alternative solutions in support of retrofit decision-making in the building industry.","Elsevier","","National Renewable Energy Lab.

Due to more recent thermal networks incorporating meshing decentralised heat and cold sources, the system often has to deal with variable temperatures and mass flow rates, with flow reversal occurring more frequently. This paper presents the mathematical derivation and software implementation in Modelica of a thermo-hydraulic model for thermal networks that meets the above requirements and compares it to both experimental data and a commonly used model. Good correspondence between experimental data from a controlled test set-up and simulations using the presented model was found. Compared to measurement data from a real district heating network, the simulation results led to a larger error than in the controlled test set-up, but the general trend is still approximated closely and the model yields results similar to a pipe model from the Modelica Standard Library. However, the presented model simulates 1.7 (for low number of volumes) to 68 (for highly discretized pipes) times faster than a conventional model for a realistic test case. A working implementation of the presented model is made openly available within the IBPSA Modelica Library. The model is robust in the sense that grid size and time step do not need to be adapted to the flow rate, as is the case in finite volume models.","Elsevier","","Lawrence Berkeley National Lab.

Most of such systems are oversized, which leads to wasted investment, low operational efficiency and, thus, waste of energy. The accurate prediction of district cooling loads that can support the rightsizing of cooling plant equipment remains a challenge. This study develops a novel stochastic modeling method that consists of (1) six prototype house models representing most apartments in a district, (2) occupant behavior models of residential buildings reflecting their spatial and temporal diversity as well as their complexity based on a large-scale residential survey in China, and (3) a stochastic sampling process to represent all apartments and occupants in the district. The stochastic method was applied to a case study using the Designer's Simulation Toolkit (DeST) to simulate the cooling loads of a residential district in Wuhan, China. The simulation results agreed well with the measured data based on five performance metrics representing the aggregated cooling consumption, the peak cooling loads, the spatial load distribution, the temporal load distribution and the load profiles. Two prevalent simulation methods were also employed to simulate the district cooling loads. Here, the results showed that oversimplified assumptions about occupant behavior could lead to significant overestimation of the peak cooling load and the total cooling loads in the district. Future work will aim to simplify the workflow and data requirements of the stochastic method for its application, and to explore its use in predicting district heating loads and in commercial or mixed-use districts.","Elsevier","","Lawrence Berkeley National Lab.

"Cost comparison of printed circuit heat exchanger to low cost periodic flow regenerator for use as recuperator in a s-CO<sub>2</sub> Brayton cycle","Hinze, Jacob F.; Nellis, Gregory F.; Anderson, Mark H.","42 ENGINEERING; 24 POWER TRANSMISSION AND DISTRIBUTION; 32 ENERGY CONSERVATION, CONSUMPTION, AND UTILIZATION; Supercritical CO2; Brayton; Regenerator; Recuperator","Supercritical Carbon Dioxide (sCO<sub>2</sub>) power cycles have the potential to deliver high efficiency at low cost. However, in order for an sCO<sub>2</sub> cycle to reach high efficiency, highly effective recuperators are needed. These recuperative heat exchangers must transfer heat at a rate that is substantially larger than the heat transfer to the cycle itself and can therefore represent a significant portion of the power block costs. Regenerators are proposed as a cost saving alternative to high cost printed circuit recuperators for this application. A regenerator is an indirect heat exchanger which periodically stores and releases heat to the working fluid. The simple design of a regenerator can be made more inexpensively compared to current options. The objective of this paper is a detailed evaluation of regenerators as a competing technology for recuperators within an sCO<sub>2</sub> Brayton cycle. The level of the analysis presented here is sufficient to identify issues with the regenerator system in order to direct future work and also to clarify the potential advantage of pursuing this technology. A reduced order model of a regenerator is implemented into a cycle model of an sCO<sub>2</sub> Brayton cycle. An economic analysis investigates the cost savings that is possible by switching from recuperative heat exchangers to switched-bed regenerators. The cost of the regenerators was estimated using the amount of material required if the pressure vessel is sized using ASME Boiler Pressure Vessel Code (BPVC) requirements. The cost of the associated valves is found to be substantial for the regenerator system and is estimated in collaboration with an industrial valve supplier. The result of this analysis suggests that a 21.2% reduction in the contribution to the Levelized Cost of Electricity (LCoE) from the power block can be realized by switching to a regenerator-based system.","Elsevier","","Univ. of Wisconsin, Madison, WI (United States)","USDOE","","United States","2017-09-21T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: Applied Energy; Journal Volume: 208; Journal Issue: C","","Medium: ED; Size: p. 1150-1161","","","EE0007120","Journal ID: ISSN 0306-2619; PII: S0306261917313120","10.1016/j.apenergy.2017.09.037","","2021-07-26T00:00:00Z","1434935","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/1434935","https://www.osti.gov/servlets/purl/1434935","Applied Energy","C","208"

The viability of geothermal heat pumps or ground source heat pumps (GSHPs) is significant as a potential alternative energy source with substantial savings potential. While the prospect of these systems is promising for energy efficiency, careful feasibility analysis is required before implementation. Here, this paper presents the results of evaluation of the application feasibility for GSHPs in buildings across seven climate zones in three United States regions. A comprehensive methodology is developed to measure the integrated feasibility of GSHPs using compiled data for energy use intensity, energy cost and design parameters. Four different feasibility metrics are utilized: ground temperature, outdoor weather condition, energy savings potential, and cost benefits. For each metric, a corresponding feasibility score system is developed. The defined integrated feasibility score classifies the locations into five different feasibility levels ranging from Fair (0–20), Moderate (21–40), Good (41–60), High (61–80), and Very High (81–100). Conclusions show the GSHP feasibility level is High for 3 sites, Good for 8 sites and Moderate for 4 sites. Through the methodology, it is possible to develop a practical energy strategy for more economic and sustainable GSHP systems at an early design stage in the various viewpoints of geometries, climate conditions, operational factors, and energy costs.","Elsevier","","Oak Ridge National Lab.

Recently, it has been shown that EnergyPlus underestimates the savings using radiant technologies in attic spaces. The aim of this study is to understand why EnergyPlus underestimates the performance of radiant technologies and provide a solution strategy that works within the current capabilities of EnergyPlus. The analysis uses three attic energy models as a baseline for comparison for EnergyPlus. Potential reasons for the discrepancies between the attic specific energy models and EnergyPlus are isolated and individually tested. A solution strategy is proposed using the Energy Management System (EMS) capabilities within EnergyPlus. This solution strategy produces similar results to the other attic specific energy models. This paper shows that the current capabilities of EnergyPlus are sufficient to simulate radiant technologies in attics.

In this paper a real-time energy management system (EMS) for microgrids or nanogrids was developed. The developed system involves an online optimization scheme to adapt its parameters based on previous, current, and forecasted future system states. The communication requirements for all EMS modules were analyzed and are all integrated over a data distribution service (DDS) Ethernet network with appropriate quality of service (QoS) profiles.

"The human dimensions of energy use in buildings: A review","D'Oca, Simona; Hong, Tianzhen; Langevin, Jared","29 ENERGY PLANNING, POLICY, AND ECONOMY; 32 ENERGY CONSERVATION, CONSUMPTION, AND UTILIZATION; Human dimensions; Energy use; Occupant behavior; Building life cycle; Energy performance; Stakeholders","The “human dimensions” of energy use in buildings refer to the energy-related behaviors of key stakeholders that affect energy use over the building life cycle. Stakeholders include building designers, operators, managers, engineers, occupants, industry, vendors, and policymakers, who directly or indirectly influence the acts of designing, constructing, living, operating, managing, and regulating the built environments, from individual building up to the urban scale. Among factors driving high-performance buildings, human dimensions play a role that is as significant as that of technological advances. However, this factor is not well understood, and, as a result, human dimensions are often ignored or simplified by stakeholders. This work presents a review of the literature on human dimensions of building energy use to assess the state-of-the-art in this topic area. The paper highlights research needs for fully integrating human dimensions into the building design and operation processes with the goal of reducing energy use in buildings while enhancing occupant comfort and productivity. This research focuses on identifying key needs for each stakeholder involved in a building's life cycle and takes an interdisciplinary focus that spans the fields of architecture and engineering design, sociology, data science, energy policy, codes, and standards to provide targeted insights. Greater understanding of the human dimensions of energy use has several potential benefits including reductions in operating cost for building owners; enhanced comfort conditions and productivity for building occupants; more effective building energy management and automation systems for building operators and energy managers; and the integration of more accurate control logic into the next generation of human-in-the-loop technologies. The review concludes by summarizing recommendations for policy makers and industry stakeholders for developing codes, standards, and technologies that can leverage the human dimensions of energy use to reliably predict and achieve energy use reductions in the residential and commercial buildings sectors.","Elsevier","","Lawrence Berkeley National Lab.

Methanogenesis operates at a very low reducing potential compared to other forms of respiration and is therefore critical to many anaerobic environments. Harnessing or altering methanogen metabolism has the potential to mitigate global warming and even be utilized for energy applications. Here, we report draft genome sequences for the isolated methanogens Methanobacterium bryantii, Methanosarcina spelaei, Methanosphaera cuniculi, and Methanocorpusculum parvum. These anaerobic, methane-producing archaea represent a diverse set of isolates, capable of methylotrophic, acetoclastic, and hydrogenotrophic methanogenesis. Assembly and analysis of the genomes allowed for simple and rapid reconstruction of metabolism in the four methanogens. Comparison of the distribution of Clusters of Orthologous Groups (COG) proteins to a sample of genomes from the RefSeq database revealed a trend towards energy conservation in genome composition of all methanogens sequenced. Further analysis of the predicted membrane proteins and transporters distinguished differing energy conservation methods utilized during methanogenesis, such as chemiosmotic coupling in Msar. spelaei and electron bifurcation linked to chemiosmotic coupling in Mbac. bryantii and Msph. cuniculi. Methanogens occupy a unique ecological niche, acting as the terminal electron acceptors in anaerobic environments, and their genomes display a significant shift towards energy conservation. The genome-enabled reconstructed metabolisms reported here have significance to diverse anaerobic communities and have led to proposed substrate utilization not previously reported in isolation, such as formate and methanol metabolism in Mbac. bryantii and CO<sub>2</sub> metabolism in Msph. cuniculi. The newly proposed substrates establish an important foundation with which to decipher how methanogens behave in native communities, as CO<sub>2</sub> and formate are common electron carriers in microbial communities.","Springer Science + Business Media","","Univ. of California, Santa Barbara, CA (United States)","USDOE Office of Science (SC), Biological and Environmental Research (BER); Univ. of California (United States); US Army Research Office (ARO); National Science Foundation (NSF); VILLUM Foundation (Denmark)","","United Kingdom","2017-08-21T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: BMC Genomics Journal Volume: 18 Journal Issue: 1","","Medium: X","","","SC0010352; W911NF-09-0001; OCE-1046144; DGE 1144085; VKR023128","Journal ID: ISSN 1471-2164; 639; PII: 4036","10.1186/s12864-017-4036-4","","2021-01-25T00:00:00Z","1618559","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/1618559","","BMC Genomics","1","18"
"Developing a landscape of urban building energy use with improved spatiotemporal representations in a cool-humid climate","Li, Wenliang; Zhou, Yuyu; Cetin, Kristen S.; Yu, Sha; Wang, Yu; Liang, Bingqing","32 ENERGY CONSERVATION, CONSUMPTION, AND UTILIZATION","Urban buildings account for up to 75% of total energy use in the United States (U.S.). Understanding urban building energy use is important for developing feasible options to mitigate energy use and greenhouse gas emissions. In this study, an improved bottom-up building energy use model, named City Building Energy Use Model (CityBEUM), was developed to estimate building energy use for all buildings in Polk County, Iowa. First, 28 commercial and 6 residential building prototypes were designed by combing Assessor's parcel data and building footprint data. Then, the EnergyPlus in the CityBEUM was calibrated for all building prototypes using the U.S. Energy Information Administration's survey data, monthly utility meter data, and actual weather data. Finally, spatial and temporal variations of building energy use in the study area were estimated using the CityBEUM. Results indicate that the spatial variation of building energy use in the study area can be captured using the CityBEUM. With the monthly-calibrated model, the temporal pattern of urban building energy use can be well represented. The comparison of building energy use using the Typical Meteorological Year and actual weather data demonstrates the importance of using actual weather data in building energy modeling for an improved temporal representation.","Elsevier","","Pacific Northwest National Lab.

Foresee is built on a multiobjective model predictive control framework, wherein the objectives consist of energy cost, thermal comfort, user convenience, and carbon emission. Foresee learns user preferences on different objectives and acts on their behalf to operate building equipment, such as home appliances, photovoltaic systems, and battery storage. In this work, machine-learning algorithms were used to derive data-driven appliance models and usage patterns to predict the home's future energy consumption. This approach enables highly accurate predictions of comfort needs, energy costs, environmental impacts, and grid service availability. Simulation studies were performed on field data from a residential building stock data set collected in the Pacific Northwest. Results indicated that foresee generated up to 7.6% whole-home energy savings without requiring substantial behavioral changes. When responding to demand response events, foresee was able to provide load forecasts upon receipt of event notifications and delivered the committed demand response services with 10% or fewer errors. Foresee fully utilized the potential of the battery storage and controllable building loads and delivered up to 7.0-kW load reduction and 13.5-kW load increase. As a result, these benefits are provided while maintaining the occupants' thermal comfort or convenience in using their appliances.","Elsevier","","National Renewable Energy Lab.

"A novel Variable Refrigerant Flow (VRF) heat recovery system model: Development and validation","Zhang, Rongpeng; Sun, Kaiyu; Hong, Tianzhen; Yura, Yoshinori; Hinokuma, Ryohei","32 ENERGY CONSERVATION, CONSUMPTION, AND UTILIZATION; Variable Refrigerant Flow; Heat recovery; Energy modeling; Validation; Building performance simulation; Controls","As one of the latest emerging HVAC technologies, the Variable Refrigerant Flow (VRF) system with heat recovery (HR) configurations has obtained extensive attention from both the academia and industry. Compared with the conventional VRF systems with heat pump (HP) configurations, VRF-HR is capable of recovering heat from cooling zones to heating zones and providing simultaneous cooling and heating operations. Moreover, this could lead to substantial energy saving potential and more flexible zonal control. In this paper, a novel model is developed to simulate the energy performance of VRF-HR systems. It adheres to a more physics-based development with the ability to simulate the refrigerant loop performance and consider the dynamics of more operational parameters, which is crucial for representing more advanced control logics. Another key feature of the model is the introduction of component-level curves for indoor units and outdoor units instead of overall performance curves for the entire system, and thus it requires much fewer user-specified performance curves as model inputs. The validation study reflects good agreements between the simulated energy use from the new VRF-HR model and the laboratory measurement data across all operational modes at sub-hourly time steps. The model has been adopted in the official release of the EnergyPlus simulation program since Version 8.6, which enables more accurate and robust assessments of VRF-HR systems to support their applications in energy retrofit of existing buildings or design of zero-net-energy buildings.","Elsevier","","Lawrence Berkeley National Lab.

Despite research that has quantified the costs, benefits, and energy savings of MBCx, the process remains under-utilized. To understand why MBCx is not more frequently adopted and how to encourage its use, this research synthesizes qualitative data from over 40 organizations, currently engaging in MBCx. The outcome of this research is a framework containing variables that emerged from the qualitative data, marked as barriers or enablers, organized by phases of the MBCx process. The framework is comprised of 51 emergent variables that fall within 13 different categories. The variables that most frequently act as barriers are data configuration, measurement & verification (M&V), developing specifications for EMIS, and data architecture. Although some variables that act as barriers for one organization were identified as enablers for another. For example, payback/ROI was considered a barrier 7 times and an enabler 3 times. One organization had difficulty making the business case for the initial investment for MBCx due to lack of cost information, while another was able to justify large investments with documented savings of previously implemented measures identified through MBCx. The framework formally validates barriers found in previous research, and can be used by practitioners to better understand common experiences with MBCx. This research also highlights the need for a similar collective data set to validate common enablers to MBCx and also the need for empirical research to determine relationships between variables.","Elsevier","","Lawrence Berkeley National Lab.

Urban building energy models (UBEM) can support city managers to evaluate and prioritize energy conservation measures (ECMs) for investment and the design of incentive and rebate programs. This paper presents the retrofit analysis feature of City Building Energy Saver (CityBES) to automatically generate and simulate UBEM using EnergyPlus based on cities’ building datasets and user-selected ECMs. CityBES is a new open web-based tool to support city-scale building energy efficiency strategic plans and programs. The technical details of using CityBES for UBEM generation and simulation are introduced, including the workflow, key assumptions, and major databases. Also presented is a case study that analyzes the potential retrofit energy use and energy cost savings of five individual ECMs and two measure packages for 940 office and retail buildings in six city districts in northeast San Francisco, United States. The results show that: (1) all five measures together can save 23–38% of site energy per building; (2) replacing lighting with light-emitting diode lamps and adding air economizers to existing heating, ventilation and air-conditioning (HVAC) systems are most cost-effective with an average payback of 2.0 and 4.3 years, respectively; and (3) it is not economical to upgrade HVAC systems or replace windows in San Francisco due to the city's mild climate and minimal cooling and heating loads. Furthermore, the CityBES retrofit analysis feature does not require users to have deep knowledge of building systems or technologies for the generation and simulation of building energy models, which helps overcome major technical barriers for city managers and their consultants to adopt UBEM.","Elsevier","","Lawrence Berkeley National Lab.

A 3D polyaniline (PANI)-based hydrogel was used for preparing a new type of single atomic iron site-rich catalyst, which has exhibited exceptionally enhanced activity and stability compared to conventional Fe-N-C catalysts supported on amorphous carbon blacks. The achieved performance metric on the hydrogel PANI-Fe catalysts is one of the best ever reported PGM-free catalysts, reaching a half-wave potential up to 0.83 V vs. RHE and only leaving 30 mV gap with Pt/C catalysts (60 μgPt/cm2) in challenging acidic media. Remarkable ORR stability was accomplished as well on the same catalyst evidenced by using harsh potential cycling tests. The well dispersion of atomic iron into partially graphitized carbon, featured with dominance of micropores and porous network structures, is capable of accommodating increased number of active sites, strengthening local bonding among iron, nitrogen and carbon, and facilitating mass transfer.

"Occupant behavior models: A critical review of implementation and representation approaches in building performance simulation programs","Hong, Tianzhen; Chen, Yixing; Belafi, Zsofia; D'Oca, Simona","32 ENERGY CONSERVATION, CONSUMPTION, AND UTILIZATION; 97 MATHEMATICS AND COMPUTING; occupant behavior; data model; behavior modeling; building performance simulation; co-simulation","Occupant behavior (OB) in buildings is a leading factor influencing energy use in buildings. Quantifying this influence requires the integration of OB models with building performance simulation (BPS). This study reviews approaches to representing and implementing OB models in today’s popular BPS programs, and discusses weaknesses and strengths of these approaches and key issues in integrating of OB models with BPS programs. Two of the key findings are: (1) a common data model is needed to standardize the representation of OB models, enabling their flexibility and exchange among BPS programs and user applications; the data model can be implemented using a standard syntax (e.g., in the form of XML schema), and (2) a modular software implementation of OB models, such as functional mock-up units for co-simulation, adopting the common data model, has advantages in providing a robust and interoperable integration with multiple BPS programs. Such common OB model representation and implementation approaches help standardize the input structures of OB models, enable collaborative development of a shared library of OB models, and allow for rapid and widespread integration of OB models with BPS programs to improve the simulation of occupant behavior and quantification of their impact on building performance.","","","Lawrence Berkeley National Lab.

This study presents a steady state TE dryer model, and validates the model against results from an experimental prototype. The system model is composed of a TE heat pump element model coupled with a psychrometric dryer sub-model. Experimental results had energy factors (EFs) of up to 2.95 kg of dry cloth per kWh (6.51 lb<sub>c</sub>/kWh), with a dry time of 159 min. A faster dry time of 96 min was also achieved at an EF of 2.54 kg<sub>c</sub>/kWh (5.60 lb<sub>c</sub>/kWh).

Yet, building energy codes can only deliver results when the codes are implemented. For this reason, studies of building energy codes need to consider implementation of building energy codes in a consistent and comprehensive way. This research identifies elements and practices in implementing building energy codes, covering codes in 22 countries that account for 70% of global energy use in buildings. These elements and practices include: comprehensive coverage of buildings by type, age, size, and geographic location; an implementation framework that involves a certified agency to inspect construction at critical stages; and building materials that are independently tested, rated, and labeled. Training and supporting tools are another element of successful code implementation. Some countries have also introduced compliance evaluation studies, which suggested that tightening energy requirements would only be meaningful when also addressing gaps in implementation (Pitt&Sherry, 2014; U.S. DOE, 2016b). Here, this article provides examples of practices that countries have adopted to assist with implementation of building energy codes.","Elsevier","","Pacific Northwest National Lab.

These effects are studied through the point of view of photovoltaics—however, the results have important implications on the operation of all optoelectronic devices with donor/acceptor interfaces, such as light emitting diodes and photodetectors. Our findings can be summarized by two points. First, devices with donor molecules face-on to the acceptor interface have a higher charge transfer state energy and less non-radiative recombination, resulting in larger open-circuit voltages and higher radiative efficiencies. Second, devices with donor molecules edge-on to the acceptor interface are more efficient at charge generation, attributed to smaller electronic coupling between the charge transfer states and the ground state, and lower activation energy for charge generation.","Nature Publishing Group","","SLAC National Accelerator Lab., Menlo Park, CA (United States)","USDOE","","United States","2017-07-19T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: Nature Communications; Journal Volume: 8; Journal Issue: 1","","Medium: ED; Size: Article No. 79","","","AC02-76SF00515","Journal ID: ISSN 2041-1723; PII: 107","10.1038/s41467-017-00107-4","","2022-05-23T00:00:00Z","1374371","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/1374371","https://www.osti.gov/servlets/purl/1374371","Nature Communications","1","8"

It is able to outcouple both the waveguide and the substrate modes, two modes accounting for significant losses in OLED device efficiency. With enhanced light outcoupling, white OLEDs subsequently fabricated on the nanocomposite substrates demonstrate performance metrics of 107 lm W<sup>-1</sup> power efficiency and 49% external quantum efficiency at 1000 cd m<sup>-2</sup>.

It is important to have validated simulation tools to provide a basis for this analysis. This paper outlines a review and validation of the ISO 15099 center-of-glass zero-solar-load heat transfer correlations for windows with cellular shades. Thermal transmittance was measured experimentally, simulated using computational fluid dynamics (CFD) analysis, and simulated utilizing correlations from ISO 15099 as implemented in Berkeley Lab WINDOW and THERM software. CFD analysis showed ISO 15099 underestimates heat flux of rectangular cavities by up to 60% when aspect ratio (AR) = 1 and overestimates heat flux up to 20% when AR = 0.5. CFD analysis also showed that wave-type surfaces of cellular shades have less than 2% impact on heat flux through the cavities and less than 5% for natural convection of room-side surface. WINDOW was shown to accurately represent heat flux of the measured configurations to a mean relative error of 0.5% and standard deviation of 3.8%. Finally, several shade parameters showed significant influence on correlation accuracy, including distance between shade and glass, inconsistency in cell stretch, size of perimeter gaps, and the mounting hardware.","Elsevier","","Lawrence Berkeley National Lab.

This trend raises concerns that the resulting shift in the balance of sensible and latent cooling loads may result in higher indoor humidity, occupant discomfort, and stunted adoption of high-efficiency homes. This study utilizes established moisture-buffering and air-conditioner latent degradation models in conjunction with an approach to stochastically model internal gains. Building loads and indoor humidity levels are compared for simulations of typical new construction homes and high-efficiency homes in 10 US cities. The sensitivity of indoor humidity to changes in cooling set point, air-conditioner capacity, and blower control parameters are evaluated. The results show that high-efficiency homes in humid climates have cooling loads with a higher fraction of latent loads than the typical new construction home, resulting in higher indoor humidity. Reducing the cooling set point is the easiest method to reduce indoor humidity, but it is not energy efficient, and overcooling may lead to occupant discomfort. Eliminating the blower operation at the end of cooling cycles and reducing the cooling airflow rate also reduce indoor humidity and with a smaller impact on energy use and comfort.","Elsevier","","Oak Ridge National Lab.

In fact, there is often a significant discrepancy between designed and real energy use in buildings, which is poorly understood but are believed to have more to do with the role of human behavior than building design. Building energy use is mainly influenced by six factors: climate, building envelope, building services and energy systems, building operation and maintenance, occupants’ activities and behavior, and indoor environmental quality. In the past, much research focused on the first three factors. However, the next three human-related factors can have an influence as significant as the first three. Annex 53 employed an interdisciplinary approach, integrating building science, architectural engineering, computer modeling and simulation, and social and behavioral science to develop and apply methods to analyze and evaluate the real energy use in buildings considering the six influencing factors.

Many researchers have investigated these exchangers, often using numerical models to predict their performance. However, there is a lack of information in the literature on the magnitude of the heat and mass transfer resistances, both for the dehumidifier (which absorbs moisture from the air) and the regenerator (which heats the liquid desiccant to re-concentrate it). This article focuses on internally-cooled, 3-fluid exchangers in a parallel plate geometry. Water heats or cools a desiccant across a plate, and the desiccant absorbs or releases water into an airstream through a membrane. A sensitivity analysis was used to estimate the importance of each of the heat and mass transfer resistances (air, membrane, desiccant, plate, water), and how it changes with different design geometries. The results show that, for most designs, the latent and sensible heat transfer of the dehumidifier is dominated by the air mass transfer resistance and air heat transfer resistance, respectively. The air mass transfer resistance is also important for the regenerator, but much less so; the change in the desiccant equilibrium humidity ratio due to a change in either temperature or desiccant mass fraction is much higher at the regenerator's higher temperatures. This increases the importance of (1) getting heat from the water to the desiccant/membrane interface, and (2) diffusing salt ions quickly away from the desiccant/membrane interface. The membrane heat transfer and water heat transfer resistances were found to be the least important. These results can help inform decisions about what simplifying assumptions to make in numerical models, and can also help in designing these exchangers by understanding which resistances are most important.","Elsevier","","National Renewable Energy Lab.

"Analysing the usage and evidencing the importance of fast chargers for the adoption of battery electric vehicles","Neaimeh, Myriam; Salisbury, Shawn D.; Hill, Graeme A.; Blythe, Philip T.; Scoffield, Don R.; Francfort, James E.","32 ENERGY CONSERVATION, CONSUMPTION, AND UTILIZATION; electric vehicle; public charging infrastructure; fast charging; rapid charging; driving range; regression analysis; 32 - ENERGY CONSERVATION, CONSUMPTION, AND UTILIZATION","An appropriate charging infrastructure is one of the key aspects needed to support the mass adoption of battery electric vehicles (BEVs), and it is suggested that publically available fast chargers could play a key role in this infrastructure. As fast charging is a relatively new technology, very little research is conducted on the topic using real world datasets, and it is of utmost importance to measure actual usage of this technology and provide evidence on its importance to properly inform infrastructure planning. 90,000 fast charge events collected from the first large-scale roll-outs and evaluation projects of fast charging infrastructure in the UK and the US and 12,700 driving days collected from 35 BEVs in the UK were analysed. Using multiple regression analysis, we examined the relationship between daily driving distance and standard and fast charging and demonstrated that fast chargers are more influential. Fast chargers enabled using BEVs on journeys above their single-charge range that would have been impractical using standard chargers. Fast chargers could help overcome perceived and actual range barriers, making BEVs more attractive to future users. At current BEV market share, there is a vital need for policy support to accelerate the development of fast charge networks.","Elsevier","","Idaho National Lab.

Although product and install costs are typically higher than the ductless mini-split heat pumps, this technology is well worth the premium for some homeowners who do not like to see an indoor unit in their living area. Due to the interest in this technology by local utilities and homeowners, the Bonneville Power Administration (BPA) has funded the Pacific Northwest National Laboratory (PNNL) and the National Renewable Energy Laboratory (NREL) to develop capabilities within the Building Energy Optimization (BEopt) tool to model ducted mini-split heat pumps. After the fundamental capabilities were added, energy-use results could be compared to other technologies that were already in BEopt, such as zonal electric resistance heat, central air source heat pumps, and ductless mini-split heat pumps. Each of these technologies was then compared using five prototype configurations in three different BPA heating zones to determine how the ducted mini-split technology would perform under different scenarios. The result of this project was a set of EnergyPlus models representing the various prototype configurations in each climate zone. Overall, the ducted mini-split heat pumps saved about 33-60% compared to zonal electric resistance heat (with window AC systems modeled in the summer). The results also showed that the ducted mini-split systems used about 4% more energy than the ductless mini-split systems, which saved about 37-64% compared to electric zonal heat (depending on the prototype and climate).","American Society of Heating, Refrigerating and Air-Conditioning Engineers","","National Renewable Energy Lab.

"A novel approach to estimate emissions from large transportation networks: Hierarchical clustering-based link-driving-schedules for EPA-MOVES using dynamic time warping measures","Aziz, H. M. Abdul; Ukkusuri, Satish V.","32 ENERGY CONSERVATION, CONSUMPTION, AND UTILIZATION; 33 ADVANCED PROPULSION SYSTEMS; 54 ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCES; Dynamic time warping; emissions; EPA-MOVES; link driving schedule","We present that EPA-MOVES (Motor Vehicle Emission Simulator) is often integrated with traffic simulators to assess emission levels of large-scale urban networks with signalized intersections. High variations in speed profiles exist in the context of congested urban networks with signalized intersections. The traditional average-speed-based emission estimation technique with EPA-MOVES provides faster execution while underestimates the emissions in most cases because of ignoring the speed variation at congested networks with signalized intersections. In contrast, the atomic second-by-second speed profile (i.e., the trajectory of each vehicle)-based technique provides accurate emissions at the cost of excessive computational power and time. We addressed this issue by developing a novel method to determine the link-driving-schedules (LDSs) for the EPA-MOVES tool. Our research developed a hierarchical clustering technique with dynamic time warping similarity measures (HC-DTW) to find the LDS for EPA-MOVES that is capable of producing emission estimates better than the average-speed-based technique with execution time faster than the atomic speed profile approach. We applied the HC-DTW on a sample data from a signalized corridor and found that HC-DTW can significantly reduce computational time without compromising the accuracy. The developed technique in this research can substantially contribute to the EPA-MOVES-based emission estimation process for large-scale urban transportation network by reducing the computational time with reasonably accurate estimates. This method is highly appropriate for transportation networks with higher variation in speed such as signalized intersections. Lastly, experimental results show error difference ranging from 2% to 8% for most pollutants except PM<sub>10</sub>.","Taylor & Francis","","Oak Ridge National Lab.

A component of the research is to use fluid tracers to understand the multifluid flow patterns that develop between injection and production wells via collected field data and supporting numerical reservoir models. The FWU, located in the Anadarko Basin, Ochiltree County, Texas, and being operated by Chaparral Energy, is a mature EOR water-flood field, which is currently being converted to a CO<sub>2</sub> flow, with inverted 5-spot patterns transitioning from pure water to alternating CO<sub>2</sub> and water floods (i.e., water alternating gas (WAG)) at an approximate rate of one every 6 to 10 months. The SWP tracer program is conducting a suite of tracer injections into the active 5-spot patterns at the FWU. Tracers have been selected to be nonreactive and either principally soluble in CO<sub>2</sub> (gas soluble) or water (aqueous soluble). In addition to characterizing the multifluid flow behaviour within reservoir, the gas and aqueous tracers have roles in detecting any leakage from the reservoir. A total of seven unique perfluorocarbon tracer (PFT) compounds make up the suite of gas soluble tracers and eight unique naphthalene sulfonate tracer (NPT) compounds comprise the aqueous soluble tracers. Lastly, all selected tracers are significantly detectable below the parts per billion concentrations, allowing for high resolution for the inter-well tests at relatively low injection volumes.","Elsevier","","Pacific Northwest National Lab.

Even though many advancements in cell chemistry have been realized since the lithium-ion battery was first commercialized in 1991, few major breakthroughs have occurred in the past decade. Therefore, future cost reduction will rely on cell manufacturing and broader market acceptance. Here, this article discusses three major aspects for cost reduction: (1) quality control to minimize scrap rate in cell manufacturing; (2) novel electrode processing and engineering to reduce processing cost and increase energy density and throughputs; and (3) material development and optimization for lithium-ion batteries with high-energy density.

Here, investment costs of energy-efficient technologies are modeled dynamically in the Industrial Sector Energy-Efficiency Model (ISEEM) using a technological learning formula. Results from 24 energy-efficient technologies – 14 existing, 10 emerging – selected from the United States (U.S.) iron and steel sector show that when technological learning is incorporated into the model, total energy consumption of this sector is expected to decrease by 13% (180 PJ) in 2050 compared to energy consumption in a non-learning scenario. Average energy intensity of the steel production improves from 12.3 GJ/t in the non-learning scenario to 10.7 GJ/t in the learning scenario in 2050. This decrease represents a cost savings of US $1.6 billion and a carbon dioxide emissions reduction potential of 14.9 billion tonnes. In conclusion, results discussed in this paper focus on the U.S. iron and steel sector, but the proposed framework can be applied to study new technology development in any other industrial processes and regions.","Elsevier","","Lawrence Berkeley National Lab.

"Coupling fast fluid dynamics and multizone airflow models in Modelica <em>Buildings</em> library to simulate the dynamics of HVAC systems","Tian, Wei; Sevilla, Thomas Alonso; Zuo, Wangda; Sohn, Michael D.","32 ENERGY CONSERVATION, CONSUMPTION, AND UTILIZATION; Fast fluid dynamics; Multizone airflow networks; Modelica; HVAC modeling","Multizone models are widely used in building airflow and energy performance simulations due to their fast computing speed. However, multizone models assume that the air in a room is well mixed, consequently limiting their application. In specific rooms where this assumption fails, the use of computational fluid dynamics (CFD) models may be an alternative option. Previous research has mainly focused on coupling CFD models and multizone models to study airflow in large spaces. While significant, most of these analyses did not consider the coupled simulation of the building airflow with the building’s Heating, Ventilation, and Air-Conditioning (HVAC) systems. This paper tries to fill the gap by integrating the models for HVAC systems with coupled multizone and CFD simulations for airflows, using the Modelica simulation platform. To improve the computational efficiency, we incorporated a simplified CFD model named fast fluid dynamics (FFD). We first introduce the data synchronization strategy and implementation in Modelica. Then, we verify the implementation using two case studies involving an isothermal and a non-isothermal flow by comparing model simulations to experiment data. Afterward, we study another three cases that are deemed more realistic. Furthermore, this is done by attaching a variable air volume (VAV) terminal box and a VAV system to previous flows to assess the capability of the models in studying the dynamic control of HVAC systems. Finally, we discuss further research needs on the coupled simulation using the models.","Elsevier","","Univ. of Colorado, Boulder, CO (United States)","USDOE Office of Energy Efficiency and Renewable Energy (EERE), Energy Efficiency Office.

Yet, NH<sub>3</sub> production is energy intensive. About 2% of the world's commercial energy is consumed as fossil fuels for NH<sub>3</sub> synthesis based on the century-old Haber-Bosch (H.-B.) process. The state of the art and the opportunities for reducing the fossil energy footprint of industrial H.-B. NH<sub>3</sub> synthesis are discussed. It is shown that even a hypothetical utterly revolutionary H.-B. catalyst could not significantly reduce the energy demand of H.-B. NH<sub>3</sub> as this is governed by hydrogen production. Renewable energy-enabled, fossil-free NH<sub>3</sub> synthesis is then evaluated based on the exceptional and continuing cost decline of renewable electricity. H.-B. syngas (H<sub>2</sub>, N<sub>2</sub>) is assumed to be produced by electrolysis and cryogenic air separation and then supplied to an existing H.-B. synthesis loop. Fossil-free NH<sub>3</sub> could be produced for energy costs of about $232 per tonne NH<sub>3</sub> without claiming any economic benefits for the avoidance of about 1.5 tonnes of CO<sub>2</sub> released per tonne NH<sub>3</sub> compared to the most efficient H.-B. implementations. Research into alternatives to the H.-B. process might be best targeted at emerging markets with currently little NH<sub>3</sub> synthesis capacity but significant future population growth in markets such as Africa. Reduced capital intensity, good scale-down economics, tolerance for process upsets and contamination, and intermittent operability are some desirable characteristics of NH<sub>3</sub> synthesis in less developed markets and for stranded resources. Lastly, processes that are fundamentally different from H.-B. may come to the fore under these specific boundary conditions.","American Institute of Physics (AIP)","","Kansas State Univ., Manhattan, KS (United States).

However, in current building performance simulation programs, occupancy inputs are static and lack diversity, contributing to discrepancies between the simulated and actual building performance. This work presents an Occupancy Simulator that simulates the stochastic behavior of occupant presence and movement in buildings, capturing the spatial and temporal occupancy diversity. Each occupant and each space in the building are explicitly simulated as an agent with their profiles of stochastic behaviors. The occupancy behaviors are represented with three types of models: (1) the status transition events (e.g., first arrival in office) simulated with probability distribution model, (2) the random moving events (e.g., from one office to another) simulated with a homogeneous Markov chain model, and (3) the meeting events simulated with a new stochastic model. A hierarchical data model was developed for the Occupancy Simulator, which reduces the amount of data input by using the concepts of occupant types and space types. Finally, a case study of a small office building is presented to demonstrate the use of the Simulator to generate detailed annual sub-hourly occupant schedules for individual spaces and the whole building. The Simulator is a web application freely available to the public and capable of performing a detailed stochastic simulation of occupant presence and movement in buildings. Future work includes enhancements in the meeting event model, consideration of personal absent days, verification and validation of the simulated occupancy results, and expansion for use with residential buildings.","","","Lawrence Berkeley National Lab.

Various fault detection and diagnostic methods have been developed to identify and analyze HVAC operational faults at the component or subsystem level. However, current methods lack a holistic approach to predicting the overall impacts of faults at the building level—an approach that adequately addresses the coupling between various operational components, the synchronized effect between simultaneous faults, and the dynamic nature of fault severity. This study introduces the novel development of a fault-modeling feature in EnergyPlus which fills in the knowledge gap left by previous studies. This paper presents the design and implementation of the new feature in EnergyPlus and discusses in detail the fault-modeling challenges faced. The new fault-modeling feature enables EnergyPlus to quantify the impacts of faults on building energy use and occupant comfort, thus supporting the decision making of timely fault corrections. Including actual building operational faults in energy models also improves the accuracy of the baseline model, which is critical in the measurement and verification of retrofit or commissioning projects. As an example, EnergyPlus version 8.6 was used to investigate the impacts of a number of typical operational faults in an office building across several U.S. climate zones. Finally, the results demonstrate that the faults have significant impacts on building energy performance as well as on occupant thermal comfort.

In this study we investigated the climate impacts of widespread deployment of cool pavements in California cities. Using the Weather Research and Forecasting model, we simulated the current climate of California at 4 km spatial resolution. Comparing this simulation to 105 weather stations in California suggested an overall mean bias (model minus observation) of –0.30°C. Widespread pavement albedo increases of 0.1 and 0.4 in California cities were then simulated. Comparing temperature reductions for each scenario showed that the climate response to pavement albedo modification was nearly linear. Temperature reductions at 14:00 local standard time were found to be 0.32°C per 0.1 increase in grid cell average albedo. Temperature reductions were found to peak in the late morning and evening when (a) boundary layer heights were low and (b) solar irradiance (late morning) and heat accumulation in the pavement (evening) was high. Temperature reductions in summer were found to exceed those in winter, as expected. After scaling the results using realistic data-derived urban canyon morphologies and an off-line urban canyon albedo model, annual average surface air temperature reductions from increasing pavement albedo by 0.4 ranged from 0.18°C (Palm Springs) to 0.86°C (San Jose). We note the variation among cities was due to differences in baseline climate, size of the city, urban fraction, and urban morphology.","American Geophysical Union","","Lawrence Berkeley National Lab.

"Evaluation of energy savings potential of variable refrigerant flow (VRF) from variable air volume (VAV) in the U.S. climate locations","Kim, Dongsu; Cox, Sam J.; Cho, Heejin; Im, Piljae","32 ENERGY CONSERVATION, CONSUMPTION, AND UTILIZATION; 54 ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCES","Variable refrigerant flow (VRF) systems are known for their high energy performance and thus can improve energy efficiency both in residential and commercial buildings. The energy savings potential of this system has been demonstrated in several studies by comparing the system performance with conventional HVAC systems such as rooftop variable air volume systems (RTU-VAV) and central chiller and boiler systems. This paper evaluates the performance of VRF and RTU-VAV systems in a simulation environment using widely-accepted whole building energy modeling software, EnergyPlus. A medium office prototype building model, developed by the U.S. Department of Energy (DOE), is used to assess the performance of VRF and RTU-VAV systems. Each system is placed in 16 different locations, representing all U.S. climate zones, to evaluate the performance variations. Both models are compliant with the minimum energy code requirements prescribed in ASHRAE standard 90.1-2010 — energy standard for buildings except low-rise residential buildings. Finally, a comparison study between the simulation results of VRF and RTU-VAV models is made to demonstrate energy savings potential of VRF systems. The simulation results show that the VRF systems would save around 15–42% and 18–33% for HVAC site and source energy uses compared to the RTU-VAV systems. In addition, calculated results for annual HVAC cost savings point out that hot and mild climates show higher percentage cost savings for the VRF systems than cold climates mainly due to the differences in electricity and gas use for heating sources.","Elsevier","","Oak Ridge National Lab.

This study outlines a review and validation of the ISO 15099 centre-of-glass thermal transmittance correlations for naturally ventilated cavities through measurement and detailed simulations. The focus is on the impacts of room-side ventilated cavities, such as those found with solar screens and horizontal louvred blinds. The thermal transmittance of these systems is measured experimentally, simulated using computational fluid dynamics analysis, and simulated utilizing simplified correlations from ISO 15099. Finally, correlation coefficients are proposed for the ISO 15099 algorithm that reduces the mean error between measured and simulated heat flux for typical solar screens from 16% to 3.5% and from 13% to 1% for horizontal blinds.","Taylor & Francis","","Lawrence Berkeley National Lab.

"Regional water consumption for hydro and thermal electricity generation in the United States","Lee, Uisung; Han, Jeongwoo; Elgowainy, Amgad; Wang, Michael","13 HYDRO ENERGY; 32 ENERGY CONSERVATION, CONSUMPTION, AND UTILIZATION; water consumption factor; hydropower; thermoelectricity; life-cycle analysis; allocation; regional analysis","Water is an essential resource for most electric power generation technologies. Thermal power plants typically require a large amount of cooling water whose evaporation is regarded to be consumed. Hydropower plants result in evaporative water loss from the large surface areas of the storing reservoirs. This paper estimated the regional water consumption factors (WCFs) for thermal and hydro electricity generation in the United States, because the WCFs of these power plants vary by region and water supply and demand balance are of concern in many regions. For hydropower, total WCFs were calculated using a reservoir’s surface area, state-level water evaporation, and background evapotranspiration. Then, for a multipurpose reservoir, a fraction of its WCF was allocated to hydropower generation based on the share of the economic valuation of hydroelectricity among benefits from all purposes of the reservoir. For thermal power plants, the variations in WCFs by type of cooling technology, prime mover technology, and by region were addressed. The results show that WCFs for electricity generation vary significantly by region. Finally, the generation-weighted average WCFs of thermoelectricity and hydropower are 1.25 (range of 0.18–2.0) and 16.8 (range of 0.67–1194) L/kWh, respectively, and the generation-weighted average WCF by the U.S. generation mix in 2015 is estimated at 2.18 L/kWh.","Elsevier","","Argonne National Lab.

Four demonstration cases are then solved under a constant excitation field over all space—an infinite slab in one dimension, a longitudinal cylinder in two dimensions, a transverse cylinder in two dimensions, and a sphere in three dimensions. Numerical simulations are also performed in parallel with analytic computations, all of which verify the accuracy of the derived expressions.","IEEE","","Univ. of Utah, Salt Lake City, UT (United States)","USDOE Advanced Research Projects Agency - Energy (ARPA-E)","","United States","2017-12-22T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: IEEE Antennas and Propagation Magazine; Journal Volume: 60; Journal Issue: 1","","Medium: ED; Size: p. 81-88","","","AR0000411","Journal ID: ISSN 1045-9243","10.1109/MAP.2017.2774206","","2018-12-24T00:00:00Z","1433514","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/1433514","https://www.osti.gov/servlets/purl/1433514","IEEE Antennas and Propagation Magazine","1","60"

Many traditional charcoal-burning stoves are difficult to light due to poor draft through the fuel bed, so lighting cones are used as an inexpensive accessory to help with charcoal ignition. The goal of this work was to determine the validity of using a lighting cone to decrease the ignition time of traditional Haitian charcoal stoves, and evaluate its impact on stove emissions and fuel consumption during the typically inefficient and slow ignition phase. We found that the lighting cone successfully reduced ignition time by over 50%. Due to a more efficient, shorter ignition stage, charcoal consumption during ignition was reduced by over 40% and carbon monoxide was reduced by over 50%. This suggests that lighting cones are a viable and beneficial accessory for aiding ignition in shallow-bed charcoal stoves.","Elsevier","","Lawrence Berkeley National Lab.

Recent research proposes exploiting stranded power-uneconomic renewable power-for green supercomputing in a system called Zero-Carbon Cloud (ZCCloud). These efforts studied production supercomputing workloads on stranded-power based computing resources, demonstrating their achievable productivity. We explore economic viability of stranded-power based supercomputing, using three datacenter total-cost-of-ownership (TOO) models to study cost-effectiveness. These studies show that ZCCloud's approach can be cost-effective in the USA today, and is even more attractive in regions with higher power prices (e.g., Japan, Germany), achieving cost advantages as large as 50 percent. Environmental and power-grid benefits are a further advantage. We also explore the sensitivity of these results to changes in hardware TOO; cheaper hardware or longer lifetimes magnify the attractiveness of stranded-power based approaches, yielding advantages as large as 91 percent. These results are robust across different TCO models. Lastly, we study extreme-scale supercomputers ( >100 MW), finding stranded-power can increase peak capability per cost by as much as 80 percent.","IEEE","","Argonne National Lab.

The results demonstrate that regenerative braking efficiency varies as an exponential function of the deceleration level, rather than an average constant as assumed in previous studies. The model predictions are demonstrated to be consistent with the NTD estimates, producing a predicted error of 1.87% and -2.31%. The paper demonstrates that energy recovery reduces the overall power consumption by 20% for the tested Chicago route. Furthermore, the paper demonstrates that the proposed modeling approach is able to capture energy consumption differences associated with train, route and operational parameters, and thus is applicable for project-level analysis.

"A framework for quantifying the impact of occupant behavior on energy savings of energy conservation measures","Sun, Kaiyu; Hong, Tianzhen","32 ENERGY CONSERVATION, CONSUMPTION, AND UTILIZATION; occupant behavior; energy conservation measures; building performance simulation; energy use; building retrofit; uncertainty assessment","To improve energy efficiency—during new buildings design or during a building retrofit—evaluating the energy savings potential of energy conservation measures (ECMs) is a critical task. In building retrofits, occupant behavior significantly impacts building energy use and is a leading factor in uncertainty when determining the effectiveness of retrofit ECMs. Current simulation-based assessment methods simplify the representation of occupant behavior by using a standard or representative set of static and homogeneous assumptions ignoring the dynamics, stochastics, and diversity of occupant's energy-related behavior in buildings. The simplification contributes to significant gaps between the simulated and measured actual energy performance of buildings. This paper presents a framework for quantifying the impact of occupant behaviors on ECM energy savings using building performance simulation. During the first step of the study, three occupant behavior styles (austerity, normal, and wasteful) were defined to represent different levels of energy consciousness of occupants regarding their interactions with building energy systems (HVAC, windows, lights and plug-in equipment). Next, a simulation workflow was introduced to determine a range of the ECM energy savings. Then, guidance was provided to interpret the range of ECM savings to support ECM decision making. Finally, a pilot study was performed in a real building to demonstrate the application of the framework. Simulation results show that the impact of occupant behaviors on ECM savings vary with the type of ECM. Occupant behavior minimally affects energy savings for ECMs that are technology-driven (the relative savings differ by less than 2%) and have little interaction with the occupants; for ECMs with strong occupant interaction, such as the use of zonal control variable refrigerant flow system and natural ventilation, energy savings are significantly affected by occupant behavior (the relative savings differ by up to 20%). Finally, the study framework provides a novel, holistic approach to assessing the uncertainty of ECM energy savings related to occupant behavior, enabling stakeholders to understand and assess the risk of adopting energy efficiency technologies for new and existing buildings.","Elsevier","","Lawrence Berkeley National Lab.

The model test bed off the central Oregon Coast was selected because of the high wave energy and available measured data at the site. Two third-generation spectral wave models, SWAN and WWIII, were evaluated. A four-level nested-grid approach—from global to test bed scale—was employed. Model skills were assessed using a set of model performance metrics based on comparing six simulated wave resource parameters to observations from a wave buoy inside the test bed. Both WWIII and SWAN performed well at the test bed site and exhibited similar modeling skills. The ST4 package with WWIII, which represents better physics for wave growth and dissipation, out-performed ST2 physics and improved wave power density and significant wave height predictions. However, ST4 physics tended to overpredict the wave energy period. The newly developed ST6 physics did not improve the overall model skill for predicting the six wave resource parameters. Sensitivity analysis using different wave frequencies and direction resolutions indicated the model results were not sensitive to spectral resolutions at the test bed site, likely due to the absence of complex bathymetric and geometric features.","Elsevier","","Pacific Northwest National Lab.

"Impact of fire on global land surface air temperature and energy budget for the 20th century due to changes within ecosystems","Li, Fang; Lawrence, David M.; Bond-Lamberty, Ben","54 ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCES; 32 ENERGY CONSERVATION, CONSUMPTION, AND UTILIZATION; fire; climate; global energy budget; terrestrial ecosystems; earth system modeling; global change","Fire is a global phenomenon and tightly interacts with the biosphere and climate. This study provides the first quantitative assessment and understanding of fire’s influence on the global annual land surface air temperature and energy budget through its impact on terrestrial ecosystems. Fire impacts are quantified by comparing fire-on and fire-off simulations with the Community Earth System Model (CESM). Results show that, for the 20th century average, fire-induced changes in terrestrial ecosystems significantly increase global land annual mean surface air temperature by 0.18 °C, decrease surface net radiation and latent heat flux by 1.08 W m <sup>-2</sup> and 0.99 W m<sup>-2</sup>, respectively, and have limited influence on sensible heat flux ( 0.11 W m<sup>-2</sup>) and ground heat flux (þ0.02 W m<sup>-2</sup>). Fire impacts are most clearly seen in the tropical savannas. Our analyses suggest that fire increases surface air temperature predominantly by reducing latent heat flux, mainly due to fire-induced damage to the vegetation canopy, and decreases net radiation primarily because fire-induced surface warming significantly increases upward surface longwave radiation. This study provides an integrated estimate of fire and induced changes in ecosystems, climate, and energy budget at a global scale, and emphasizes the importance of a consistent and integrated understanding of fire effects.","IOP Publishing","","Pacific Northwest National Lab.

"Smart building management vs. intuitive human control—Lessons learnt from an office building in Hungary","Belafi, Zsofia; Hong, Tianzhen; Reith, Andras","29 ENERGY PLANNING, POLICY, AND ECONOMY; 32 ENERGY CONSERVATION, CONSUMPTION, AND UTILIZATION; 42 ENGINEERING; occupant behaviour; case study; building operation; optimization; building performance simulation","We report that smart building management and control are adopted nowadays to achieve zero-net energy use in buildings. However, without considering the human dimension, technologies alone do not necessarily guarantee high performance in buildings. An office building was designed and built according to state-of-the-art design and energy management principles in 2008. Despite the expectations of high performance, the owner was facing high utility bills and low user comfort in the building located in Budapest, Hungary. The objective of the project was to evaluate the energy performance and comfort indices of the building, to identify the causes of malfunction and to elaborate a comprehensive energy concept. Firstly, current building conditions and operation parameters were evaluated. Our investigation found that the state-of-the-art building management system was in good conditions but it was operated by building operators and occupants who are not aware of the building management practice. The energy consumption patterns of the building were simulated with energy modelling software. The baseline model was calibrated to annual measured energy consumption, using actual occupant behaviour and presence, based on results of self-reported surveys, occupancy sensors and fan-coil usage data. Realistic occupant behaviour models can capture diversity of occupant behaviour and better represent the real energy use of the building. This way our findings and the effect of our proposed improvements could be more reliable. As part of our final comprehensive energy concept, we proposed intervention measures that would increase indoor thermal comfort and decrease energy consumption of the building. A parametric study was carried out to evaluate and quantify energy, comfort and return on investment of each measure. It was found that in the best case the building could save 23% of annual energy use. Lastly, future work includes the follow-up of: occupant reactions to intervention measures, the realized energy savings, the measurement of occupant satisfaction and behavioural changes.","Springer","","Lawrence Berkeley National Lab.

"The Impact of Engine Operating Conditions on Reformate Production in a D-EGR Engine","Kalaskar, Vickey B.; Gukelberger, Raphael; Denton, Bradley; Briggs, Thomas","32 ENERGY CONSERVATION, CONSUMPTION, AND UTILIZATION","Dedicated EGR has shown promise for achieving high efficiency with low emissions [1]. For the present study, a 4-cylinder turbocharged GDI engine which was modified to a D-EGR configuration was used to investigate the impact of valve phasing and different injection strategies on the reformate production in the dedicated cylinder. Various levels of positive valve overlap were used in conjunction with different approaches for dedicated cylinder over fueling using PFI and DI fuel systems. Three speed-load combinations were studied, 2000 rpm 4 bar IMEP<sub>g</sub>, 2000 rpm 12 bar IMEP<sub>g</sub>, and 4000 rpm 12 bar IMEP<sub>g</sub>. Here, the primary investigation was conducted to map out the dedicated cylinders' performance at the operating limits of intake and exhaust cam phasing. In this case, the limits were defined as conditions that yielded either no reformate benefit or led to instability in the dedicated cylinder. Based on the result of cam timing sweeps for both PFI and a DI strategy, valve timing strategies were developed to maximize reformate production. Further, a detailed sweep of dedicated cylinder equivalence ratio (Φ) was conducted at near optimum valve phasing to study the differences between various fuel injection strategies at each speed-load combination.","SAE International","","Southwest Research Institute, San Antonio, TX (United States)","USDOE Office of Energy Efficiency and Renewable Energy (EERE), Transportation Office.

"Simulated building energy demand biases resulting from the use of representative weather stations","Burleyson, Casey D.; Voisin, Nathalie; Taylor, Z. Todd; Xie, Yulong; Kraucunas, Ian","32 ENERGY CONSERVATION, CONSUMPTION, AND UTILIZATION; building energy demand; representative cities; BEND; EnergyPlus; weather","Numerical building models are typically forced with weather data from a limited number of “representative cities” or weather stations representing different climate regions. The use of representative weather stations reduces computational costs, but often fails to capture spatial heterogeneity in weather that may be important for simulations aimed at understanding how building stocks respond to a changing climate. Here, we quantify the potential reduction in temperature and load biases from using an increasing number of weather stations over the western U.S. Our novel approach is based on deriving temperature and load time series using incrementally more weather stations, ranging from 8 to roughly 150, to evaluate the ability to capture weather patterns across different seasons. Using 8 stations across the western U.S., one from each IECC climate zone, results in an average absolute summertime temperature bias of ~4.0 °C with respect to a high-resolution gridded dataset. The mean absolute bias drops to ~1.5 °C using all available weather stations. Temperature biases of this magnitude could translate to absolute summertime mean simulated load biases as high as 13.5%. Increasing the size of the domain over which biases are calculated reduces their magnitude as positive and negative biases may cancel out. Using 8 representative weather stations can lead to a 20–40% bias of peak building loads during both summer and winter, a significant error for capacity expansion planners who may use these types of simulations. Using weather stations close to population centers reduces both mean and peak load biases. Our approach could be used by others designing aggregate building simulations to understand the sensitivity to their choice of weather stations used to drive the models.","Elsevier","","Pacific Northwest National Lab.

"Variability of absorption heat pump efficiency for domestic water heating and space heating based on time-weighted bin analysis","Ally, Moonis Raza; Sharma, Vishaldeep","32 ENERGY CONSERVATION, CONSUMPTION, AND UTILIZATION; 42 ENGINEERING; Sorption; Heat pumps; Ammonia; Water heating; HVAC","Natural gas-driven absorption heat pumps are under renewed scrutiny as a viable technology for space conditioning and water heating for residential and commercial applications because of natural gas production trends, pricing, and the speculation that it might be a “bridge fuel” in the global transition towards energy sustainability. Since any level of natural gas combustion contributes to atmospheric carbon dioxide accumulation, the merits of natural gas consuming absorption technology are re-examined in this paper from the point of view of expected efficiency throughout the United States using a time-weighted bin temperature analysis. Such analyses are necessary because equipment standards for rated performance is restricted to one set ambient condition, whereas in actual practice, the absorption heat pump (AHP) must perform over a considerably wider range of external conditions, where its efficiency may be vastly different from that at the rated condition. Quantification of variation in efficiency and system performance are imperative to address how to provide the desired utility with the least environmental impact. In this paper, we examine limiting features in absorption heat pumps and relate it to systemic performances in sixteen cities across all eight climate zones in the U.S, each containing fifteen bin temperatures. The results indicate that the true expectation of performance of an AHP is significantly less than what might be optimized for the rated condition. Statistical measures of the variation in water heating COPs show that for most cities, the COP at the rated conditions is outside the 95% Confidence Interval. Moreover, it is concluded that deployment of absorption heat pump water heaters (AHPWH) may be restricted geographically by outdoor temperature constraints.","Elsevier","","Oak Ridge National Lab.

"Development of a single-phase thermosiphon for cold collection and storage of radiative cooling","Zhao, Dongliang; Martini, Christine Elizabeth; Jiang, Siyu; Ma, Yaoguang; Zhai, Yao; Tan, Gang; Yin, Xiaobo; Yang, Ronggui","32 ENERGY CONSERVATION, CONSUMPTION, AND UTILIZATION; single-phase thermosiphon; radiative cooling; natural convection; cold collection; cold storage","A single-phase thermosiphon is developed for cold collection and storage of radiative cooling. Compared to the conventional nocturnal radiative cooling systems that use an electric pump to drive the heat transfer fluid, the proposed single-phase thermosiphon uses the buoyancy force to drive heat transfer fluid. This solution does not require electricity, therefore improving the net gain of the radiative cooling system. A single-phase thermosiphon was built, which consists of a flat panel, a cold collection tank, a water return tube, and a water distribution tank. Considering that outdoor radiative cooling flux is constantly changing (i.e. uncontrollable), an indoor testing facility was developed to provide a controllable cooling flux (comparable to a radiative cooling flux of 100 W/m2) for the evaluation of thermosiphon performance. The testing apparatus is a chilled aluminum flat plate that has a controlled air gap separation relative to the flat panel surface of the thermosiphon to emulate radiative cooling. With an average of 105 W/m2 cooling flux, the 18 liters of water in the thermosiphon was cooled to an average temperature of 12.5 degrees C from an initial temperature of 22.2 degrees C in 2 h, with a cold collection efficiency of 96.8%. The results obtained have demonstrated the feasibility of using a single-phase thermosiphon for cold collection and storage of radiative cooling. Additionally, the effects of the thermosiphon operation conditions, such as tilt angle of the flat panel, initial water temperature, and cooling energy flux, on the performance have been experimentally investigated. Modular design of the single-phase thermosiphon gives flexibility for its scalability. A radiative cooling system with multiple thermosiphon modules is expected to play an important role in cooling buildings and power plant condensers.","Elsevier","","National Renewable Energy Lab.

Simulation results are normally presented using various types of charts. However, using those charts, it is difficult to visualize and communicate the importance of occupants’ behavior to building energy performance. This study introduced a new approach to simulating and visualizing energy-related occupant behavior in office buildings. First, the Occupancy Simulator was used to simulate the occupant presence and movement and generate occupant schedules for each space as well as for each occupant. Then an occupant behavior functional mockup unit (obFMU) was used to model occupant behavior and analyze their impact on building energy use through co-simulation with EnergyPlus. Finally, an agent-based model built upon AnyLogic was applied to visualize the simulation results of the occupant movement and interactions with building systems, as well as the related energy performance. A case study using a small office building in Miami, FL was presented to demonstrate the process and application of the Occupancy Simulator, the obFMU and EnergyPlus, and the AnyLogic module in simulation and visualization of energy-related occupant behaviors in office buildings. Furthermore, the presented approach provides a new detailed and visual way for policy makers, architects, engineers and building operators to better understand occupant energy behavior and their impact on energy use in buildings, which can improve the design and operation of low energy buildings.","Springer","","Lawrence Berkeley National Lab.

The field test was conducted in as similar conditions as possible between the two systems, such as the installation and operating environments of heating, the ventilation and air conditioning (HVAC) system, including internal heat gain and outdoor conditions, including buildings to compare the performance of the two systems accurately. A VRF system and RTU were installed at the test building located in Oak Ridge, Tennessee, in the USA. The same internal heat gain was generated at the same operating time of the two systems using lighting, electric heaters, and humidifiers inside the building. The HVAC system was alternately operated between cooling and heating operations to acquire energy performance data and to compare energy usage. Furthermore, an hourly building energy simulation model was developed with regard to the VRF system and RTU, and then the model was calibrated using actual measured data. Then, annual energy consumption of the two systems were compared and analyzed using the calibrated model. Moreover, additional analysis was conducted when the controlled discharge air temperature in the RTU was changed. The field test result showed that when energy consumptions of two systems were compared at the same outdoor conditions, using the weather-normalized model, the VRF system exhibited an energy reduction of approximately 17% during cooling operation and of approximately 74% during heating operations. A comparison on the annual energy consumption using simulations showed that the VRF system reduced energy consumption more than that of the RTU by 60%. Furthermore, when the discharge air temperature in the RTU was controlled according to the outdoor air temperature, energy consumption of the RTU was reduced by 6% in cooling operations and by 18% in heating operation. As a result, energy consumption of the VRF system was reduced by more than that of the RTU by 55% approximately.","Elsevier","","Oak Ridge National Lab.

However, the standard does not consider many important factors that influence the actual energy use in buildings, and this can lead to gaps between the design estimates and actual energy consumption. To achieve the national energy savings targets defined in the strategic 12th Five-Year Plan, China developed the first standard for energy consumption of buildings GB/T51161-2016 (the Consumption Standard). This study provides an overview of the Consumption Standard, identifies its strengths and weaknesses, and recommends future improvements. The analysis and discussion of the constraint value and the leading value, two key indicators of the energy use intensity, provide insight into the intent and effectiveness of the Consumption Standard. The results indicated that consistency between China's Design Standard GB 50189-2015 and the Consumption Standard GB/T51161-2016 could be achieved if the Design Standard used the actual building operations and occupant behavior in calculating the energy use in Chinese buildings. The development of an outcome-based code in the U.S. was discussed in comparison with China's Consumption Standard, and this revealed the strengths and challenges associated with implementing a new compliance method based on actual energy use in buildings in the U.S. Overall, this study provides important insights into the latest developments of actual consumption-based building energy standards, and this information should be valuable to building designers and energy policy makers in China and the U.S.","Elsevier","","Lawrence Berkeley National Lab.

"Impact of public electric vehicle charging infrastructure","Levinson, Rebecca S.; West, Todd H.","33 ADVANCED PROPULSION SYSTEMS; 32 ENERGY CONSERVATION, CONSUMPTION, AND UTILIZATION; transporation energy; battery electric vehicle","Our work uses market analysis and simulation to explore the potential of public charging infrastructure to spur US battery electric vehicle (BEV) sales, increase national electrified mileage, and lower greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions. By employing both scenario and parametric analysis for policy driven injection of public charging stations we find the following: (1) For large deployments of public chargers, DC fast chargers are more effective than level 2 chargers at increasing BEV sales, increasing electrified mileage, and lowering GHG emissions, even if only one DC fast charging station can be built for every ten level 2 charging stations. (2) A national initiative to build DC fast charging infrastructure will see diminishing returns on investment at approximately 30,000 stations. (3) Some infrastructure deployment costs can be defrayed by passing them back to electric vehicle consumers, but once those costs to the consumer reach the equivalent of approximately 12¢/kWh for all miles driven, almost all gains to BEV sales and GHG emissions reductions from infrastructure construction are lost.","Elsevier","","Sandia National Lab.

"Lessons learned from a comparison study of charcoal stoves for Haiti","Lask, Kathleen; Booker, Kayje; Gadgil, Ashok","32 ENERGY CONSERVATION, CONSUMPTION, AND UTILIZATION; charcoal cookstoves; Haiti; cookstove evaluation; disaster relief","Biomass is the predominant cooking fuel in Haiti, where it creates burdens on both the environment and the Haitian people. Following the 2010 earthquake in Port-au-Prince, the need for fuel-efficient cookstoves was acute. Although several organizations were quite interested in dissemination of fuel-efficient stoves in the relief effort, there was little knowledge about the performance and usability of the proposed stoves. To help fill the knowledge gap, stove researchers from Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory evaluated and compared the performance of several cookstoves intended for dissemination in Haiti. This paper discusses the decisions made throughout the course of that work, from project identification and approach through the dissemination of results. It identifies the challenges faced and how they were addressed, while briefly presenting the data from stove performance evaluated using Water Boiling and Controlled Cooking Tests. Furthermore, it also highlights the importance and benefits of evaluating technologies such as cookstoves prior to dissemination, even in urgent disaster relief situations.","Elsevier","","Lawrence Berkeley National Lab.

Our objective is to minimize the total operation cost, including generation cost and spinning reserve cost of local resources as well as purchasing cost of energy from the main grid. In order to ensure the resiliency of a microgrid and improve the reliability of the local electricity supply, the microgrid is required to maintain enough spinning reserve (both up and down) to meet local demand and accommodate local renewable generation when the supply of power from the main grid is interrupted suddenly, i.e., microgrid transitions from grid-connected into islanded mode. Prevailing operational uncertainties in renewable energy resources and load are considered and captured using a robust optimization method. With proper robust level, the solution of the proposed scheduling model ensures successful islanding of the microgrid with minimum load curtailment and guarantees robustness against all possible realizations of the modeled operational uncertainties. Numerical simulations on a microgrid consisting of a wind turbine, a PV panel, a fuel cell, a micro-turbine, a diesel generator and a battery demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed scheduling model.","Institution of Engineering and Technology","","Oak Ridge National Lab.

"A comparative energy analysis of three electrochromic glazing technologies in commercial and residential buildings","DeForest, Nicholas; Shehabi, Arman; Selkowitz, Stephen; Milliron, Delia J.","32 ENERGY CONSERVATION, CONSUMPTION, AND UTILIZATION; 14 SOLAR ENERGY; Dynamic windows; Electrochromic glazings; Visible light switching; NIR switching; Energy savings; Solar heat gain","Here, we present a simulation study of three dynamic electrochromic window glazings, including a novel glazing capable of independently modulating its optical properties in both the visible and near-infrared spectrums. This capability allows this so-called “dual-band” technology to actively manage the solar heat and visible light transmitted into a building's interior, and creates the potential for heating, cooling, and lighting savings vis-à-vis competing window technologies. In this study EnergyPlus is used to simulate annual energy performance of the dual-band electrochromic (DBEC) glazing in three building types and 16 U.S. climate regions. The savings potential of DBEC windows are presented relative to a conventional electrochromic glazing; a visibly transparent, near-infrared switching electrochromic glazings; and several static alternatives, including ASHRAE 90-2010 standard compliant windows. Results indicate that the DBEC glazings are capable of outperforming alternatives in a diverse set of locations and building types, including both heating and cooling-dominated regions. Relative to code-compliant static windows, the DBEC is capable of achieving annual primary energy savings between 6 and 30 kW h/ft<sup>2</sup> of window area from reduced heating, cooling, and lighting demand. Relative to other advanced glazings, the savings are significantly lower, ranging from 0 to 1.2 kW h/ft<sup>2</sup>. Regional DBEC energy cost savings versus high performance static windows are presented to identify early potential market entries based on energy savings. Lastly, the impacts of widespread deployment of high-efficiency LED lighting on DBEC energy savings potentials are also presented.","Elsevier","","Lawrence Berkeley National Lab.

The literature indicates that historically underpriced water and wastewater rates have exhibited steadily high growth in the past 15 years, while the consumer price index (CPI) of water and sewage maintenance has outpaced the general CPI by an increasingly wide margin. This article employs a chained analysis method to examine water and wastewater rates for a group of utilities across US Census regions between 2000 and 2014. Results demonstrate that water and wastewater prices for this sample group have consistently increased and have surpassed CPI growth since 2006.

This number is steadily increasing, posing a challenge to energy regulators as well as suppliers.Tomanage the growing demand for energy, there is a need for energy system optimization, especially on the demand side. This paper uses a first principles approach to build a high-resolution energy demand model, which can be used as a test bed by academicians as well as policy makers for performing such optimizations. This framework generates activity-based, building-level, time-dependent demand profiles. The model associates appliance usage with each household activity and calculates energy consumption based on the appliance energy rating, the duration of the energy consuming activity, and the type of activity performed by each household member. It also accounts for shared activities among household members to avoid double counting. Additionally, passive energy consumptions such as space heating/cooling, lighting, etc., are measured. Lastly, validation of the results obtained by this model against real-world data for Virginia is carried out. The results indicate that the modeling framework is robust and can be extended to other parts of the U.S. and beyond.","IEEE","","Univ. of Virginia, Charlottesville, VA (United States)","USDOE Office of Energy Efficiency and Renewable Energy (EERE), Renewable Power Office.

"Optimal Attack Strategies Subject to Detection Constraints Against Cyber-Physical Systems","Chen, Yuan; Kar, Soummya; Moura, Jose M. F.","32 ENERGY CONSERVATION, CONSUMPTION, AND UTILIZATION","This paper studies an attacker against a cyberphysical system (CPS) whose goal is to move the state of a CPS to a target state while ensuring that his or her probability of being detected does not exceed a given bound. The attacker’s probability of being detected is related to the nonnegative bias induced by his or her attack on the CPS’s detection statistic. We formulate a linear quadratic cost function that captures the attacker’s control goal and establish constraints on the induced bias that reflect the attacker’s detection-avoidance objectives. When the attacker is constrained to be detected at the false-alarm rate of the detector, we show that the optimal attack strategy reduces to a linear feedback of the attacker’s state estimate. In the case that the attacker’s bias is upper bounded by a positive constant, we provide two algorithms – an optimal algorithm and a sub-optimal, less computationally intensive algorithm – to find suitable attack sequences. Finally, we illustrate our attack strategies in numerical examples based on a remotely-controlled helicopter under attack.","IEEE","","Carnegie Mellon Univ., Pittsburgh, PA (United States)","USDOE Office of Electricity (OE)","","United States","2017-03-31T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: IEEE Transactions on Control of Network Systems; Journal Volume: PP; Journal Issue: 99","","Medium: ED; Size: 12 p.","","","OE0000779","Journal ID: ISSN 2325-5870; TRN: US1703045","10.1109/TCNS.2017.2690399","","2021-07-26T00:00:00Z","1406998","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/1406998","https://www.osti.gov/servlets/purl/1406998","IEEE Transactions on Control of Network Systems","99","PP"

Here in this correspondence, an optimal operation of HC refining system is presented using nonlinear multiobjective model predictive control strategies that aim at set-point tracking objective of pulp quality, economic objective, and specific energy (SE) consumption objective, respectively. First, a set of input and output data at different times are employed to construct the subprocess model of the state process model for the HC refining system, and then the Wiener-type model can be obtained through combining the mechanism model of Canadian Standard Freeness and the state process model that determines their structures based on Akaike information criterion. Second, the multiobjective optimization strategy that optimizes both the set-point tracking objective of pulp quality and SE consumption is proposed simultaneously, which uses NSGA-II approach to obtain the Pareto optimal set. Furthermore, targeting at the set-point tracking objective of pulp quality, economic objective, and SE consumption objective, the sequential quadratic programming method is utilized to produce the optimal predictive controllers. In conclusion, the simulation results demonstrate that the proposed methods can make the HC refining system provide a better performance of set-point tracking of pulp quality when these predictive controllers are employed. In addition, while the optimal predictive controllers orienting with comprehensive economic objective and SE consumption objective, it has been shown that they have significantly reduced the energy consumption.","IEEE","","Pacific Northwest National Lab.

A suppression of the magnetization was observed for P = 0.588 GPa and P = 0.654 GPa whereas, at about P ≈1 GPa, the saturation magnetization increased and the magnetization isotherms again resembled the curves measured at atmospheric pressure. A small thermal hysteresis was observed between the heating and cooling M(T) curves at T<sub>t</sub>=3.4 K, with an applied magnetic field of H = 0.1 T.

Q.","32 ENERGY CONSERVATION, CONSUMPTION, AND UTILIZATION; 42 ENGINEERING; ORC; adsorption; thermal compressor; MOF","Organic Rankine cycle (ORC) systems have attracted interest for more than three decades due to advantages in operation at lower working temperature, low maintenance requirements, and relative simplicity (fewer components). In theory, these advantages should make ORC technology more economically attractive for the small and medium power scales (10 kW to 10 MW). Unfortunately, the theoretical promise of ORC systems for power generation has been realized at only a relatively small fraction of the potential market. Although there are a number of reasons for the low utilization of ORC technology, the root cause is directly tied to the relatively low heat-to-power conversion efficiency (2 to 7% typically) and high cost of specially designed expander–generator equipment that is up to 60% of total system cost. The resulting high cost of the power produced just does not make economic sense except in very specialized situations where on-site power is needed but unavailable (at any cost) or where local generation costs are well above regional averages. The overarching objective of the work presented here is to break this paradigm by developing and demonstrating a new harmonic adsorption recuperative power cycle (HARP) system that offers 40% more efficient power generation as compared with a standard ORC system and estimated electric power production costs at very competitive rates below $0.10/kWh.","Elsevier","","Pacific Northwest National Lab.

"Application of automated measurement and verification to utility energy efficiency program data","Granderson, Jessica; Touzani, Samir; Fernandes, Samuel; Taylor, Cody","32 ENERGY CONSERVATION, CONSUMPTION, AND UTILIZATION; M&V 2.0; savings estimation; measurement and verification; accuracy; utility programs; energy management and information systems; automation","Trustworthy savings calculations are critical to convincing regulators of both the cost-effectiveness of energy efficiency program investments and their ability to defer supply-side capital investments. Today’s methods for measurement and verification (M&V) of energy savings constitute a significant portion of the total costs of energy efficiency programs. They also require time-consuming data acquisition. A spectrum of savings calculation approaches is used, with some relying more heavily on measured data and others relying more heavily on estimated, modeled, or stipulated data. The increasing availability of “smart” meters and devices that report near-real time data, combined with new analytical approaches to quantify savings, offers the potential to conduct M&V more quickly and at lower cost, with comparable or improved accuracy. Commercial energy management and information systems (EMIS) technologies are beginning to offer these ‘M&V 2.0’ capabilities, and program administrators want to understand how they might assist programs in quickly and accurately measuring energy savings. This paper presents the results of recent testing of the ability to use automation to streamline the M&V process. In this paper, we apply an automated whole-building M&V tool to historic data sets from energy efficiency programs to begin to explore the accuracy, cost, and time trade-offs between more traditional M&V, and these emerging streamlined methods that use high-resolution energy data and automated computational intelligence. For the data sets studied we evaluate the fraction of buildings that are well suited to automated baseline characterization, the uncertainty in gross savings that is due to M&V 2.0 tools’ model error, and indications of labor time savings, and how the automated savings results compare to prior, traditionally determined savings results. The results show that 70% of the buildings were well suited to the automated approach. In a majority of the cases (80%) savings and uncertainties for each individual building were quantified to levels above the criteria in ASHRAE Guideline 14. In addition the findings suggest that M&V 2.0 methods may also offer time-savings relative to traditional approaches. Lastly, we discuss the implications of these findings relative to the potential evolution of M&V, and pilots currently being launched to test how M&V automation can be integrated into ratepayer-funded programs and professional implementation and evaluation practice.","Elsevier","","Lawrence Berkeley National Lab.

This review discusses design strategies for state-of-the-art heterogeneous electrocatalysts and associated materials for several different electrochemical transformations involving water, hydrogen, and oxygen, using theory as a means to rationalize catalyst performance. By examining the common principles that govern catalysis for different electrochemical reactions, we describe a systematic framework that clarifies trends in catalyzing these reactions, serving as a guide to new catalyst development while highlighting key gaps that need to be addressed.

"RCCI Combustion Regime Transitions in a Single-Cylinder Optical Engine and a Multi-Cylinder Metal Engine","Roberts, Gregory; Rousselle, Christine Mounaim; Musculus, Mark; Wissink, Martin; Curran, Scott; Eagle, Ethan","33 ADVANCED PROPULSION SYSTEMS; 32 ENERGY CONSERVATION, CONSUMPTION, AND UTILIZATION","We present that Reactivity Controlled Compression Ignition (RCCI) is an approach to increase engine efficiency and lower engine-out emissions by using in-cylinder stratification of fuels with differing reactivity (i.e., autoignition characteristics) to control combustion phasing. Stratification can be altered by varying the injection timing of the high-reactivity fuel, causing transitions across multiple regimes of combustion. When injection is sufficiently early, combustion approaches a highly-premixed autoignition regime, and when it is sufficiently late it approaches more mixing-controlled, diesel-like conditions. Engine performance, emissions, and control authority over combustion phasing with injection timing are most favorable in between, within the RCCI regime.To study charge preparation phenomena that dictate regime transitions, two different optical diagnostics are applied in a single-cylinder heavy-duty optical engine, and conventional engine diagnostics are applied in a multi-cylinder, light-duty all-metal engine. Both engines are operated with iso-octane and n-heptane as the low- and high-reactivity fuels, respectively. The iso-octane fuel fraction delivers 80% of the total fuel energy, the global equivalence ratio is 0.35, and no exhaust gas recirculation is used. In the optical engine, single-shot, band-pass infrared (IR) imaging of emission near 3.3 microns measures thermal C-H stretch-band emission of hot fuel vapor and intermediate combustion products, providing qualitative information about the fuel-vapor distribution and ignition locations during low-temperature heat release. Additionally, high-speed 7.2 kHz visible-light imaging of natural luminosity, optimized to detect chemiluminescence, indicates the spatial and temporal evolution of high-temperature heat release and combustion. Similar combustion regimes are observed for both engine platforms, allowing an opportunity for optical engine data to provide insight into fundamental phenomena affecting regime ranges and transitions in production engines. Key findings from imaging diagnostics indicate that at the late-injection limit of RCCI control authority, low-temperature ignition occurs when clearly identifiable jet structures are still intact, and during high-temperature combustion there is prevalent and persistent soot incandescence representative of locally mixing-limited (i.e., fuel-rich) combustion. Finally, at the early-injection limit of RCCI control, observed stratification during low-temperature ignition is subtle; however, high-temperature combustion still occurs sequentially from the bowl rim radially inwards.","SAE International","","Oak Ridge National Lab.

"Performance evaluation of an agent-based occupancy simulation model","Luo, Xuan; Lam, Khee Poh; Chen, Yixing; Hong, Tianzhen","32 ENERGY CONSERVATION, CONSUMPTION, AND UTILIZATION","Occupancy is an important factor driving building performance. Static and homogeneous occupant schedules, commonly used in building performance simulation, contribute to issues such as performance gaps between simulated and measured energy use in buildings. Stochastic occupancy models have been recently developed and applied to better represent spatial and temporal diversity of occupants in buildings. However, there is very limited evaluation of the usability and accuracy of these models. This study used measured occupancy data from a real office building to evaluate the performance of an agent-based occupancy simulation model: the Occupancy Simulator. The occupancy patterns of various occupant types were first derived from the measured occupant schedule data using statistical analysis. Then the performance of the simulation model was evaluated and verified based on (1) whether the distribution of observed occupancy behavior patterns follows the theoretical ones included in the Occupancy Simulator, and (2) whether the simulator can reproduce a variety of occupancy patterns accurately. Results demonstrated the feasibility of applying the Occupancy Simulator to simulate a range of occupancy presence and movement behaviors for regular types of occupants in office buildings, and to generate stochastic occupant schedules at the room and individual occupant levels for building performance simulation. For future work, model validation is recommended, which includes collecting and using detailed interval occupancy data of all spaces in an office building to validate the simulated occupant schedules from the Occupancy Simulator.","Elsevier","","Lawrence Berkeley National Lab.

First, the EV charging problem from consumer, aggregator, and grid operator’s perspective is investigated. A hierarchical control architecture (HCA) comprising scheduling, coordinative, and adaptive layers is then designed to realize their coordinative goal. This is realized by integrating a multi-time scale control, which works from a day-ahead scheduling up to real-time adaptive control. The performance of the developed method is investigated with high EV penetration in a typical distribution network. The simulation results demonstrates that HCA exploit EV flexibility to solve grid unbalancing and congestions with simultaneous maximization of economic benefits by ensuring EV participation to day-ahead, balancing, and regulation markets. For the given network configuration and pricing structure, HCA ensures the EV owners to get paid up to 5 times the cost they were paying without control.","MDPI AG","","Idaho National Lab.

However, occupant behavior is not well understood and is often oversimplified in the building life cycle, due to its stochastic, diverse, complex, and interdisciplinary nature. The use of simplified methods or tools to quantify the impacts of occupant behavior in building performance simulations significantly contributes to performance gaps between simulated models and actual building energy consumption. Therefore, it is crucial to understand occupant behavior in a comprehensive way, integrating qualitative approaches and data- and model-driven quantitative approaches, and employing appropriate tools to guide the design and operation of low-energy residential and commercial buildings that integrate technological and human dimensions. This paper presents ten questions, highlighting some of the most important issues regarding concepts, applications, and methodologies in occupant behavior research. The proposed questions and answers aim to provide insights into occupant behavior for current and future researchers, designers, and policy makers, and most importantly, to inspire innovative research and applications to increase energy efficiency and reduce energy use in buildings.","Elsevier","","Lawrence Berkeley National Lab.

Distribution system operators should for this reason resort to either costly grid reinforcements or to demand side management mechanisms. Since demand side management implementation is usually cheaper, it is also the favorable solution. To this end, this article presents a framework for handling grid limit violations, both voltage and current, to ensure a secure and qualitative operation of the distribution grid. This framework consists of two steps, namely a proactive centralized and subsequently a reactive decentralized control scheme. The former is employed to balance the one hour ahead load while the latter aims at regulating the consumption in real-time. In both cases, the importance of fair use of electricity demand flexibility is emphasized. Thus, it is demonstrated that this methodology aids in keeping the grid status within preset limits while utilizing flexibility from all flexibility participants.","IEEE","","Idaho National Lab.

Ir@Pt nanoparticles with several shell thicknesses were synthesized in a scalable, inexpensive, one-pot polyol method. Electrochemical analysis demonstrates the activity and stability of the Ir@Pt catalyst, with specific and mass activities increasing to 2.6 and 1.8 times that of commercial Pt/C (TKK), respectively, after 10 000 stability cycles. Furthermore, activity enhancement of the Ir@Pt catalyst is attributed to weakening of the oxygen binding to the Pt surface induced by the Ir core.","American Chemical Society (ACS)","","SLAC National Accelerator Lab., Menlo Park, CA (United States)","USDOE Office of Science (SC), Basic Energy Sciences (BES)","","United States","2016-12-28T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: ACS Energy Letters; Journal Volume: 2; Journal Issue: 1","","Medium: ED; Size: p. 244-249","","","AC02-76SF00515","Journal ID: ISSN 2380-8195; nmat4760; TRN: US1701083","10.1021/acsenergylett.6b00585","","2021-07-23T00:00:00Z","1349289","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/1349289","https://www.osti.gov/servlets/purl/1349289","ACS Energy Letters","1","2"

We analyze and compare the modeling frameworks, underlying data, assumptions, intermediate parameters, and projections to identify the sources of divergence or consistency, as well as key knowledge gaps. We find that there are significant differences in the base-year data and key parameters for future projections, especially for developing countries. These include passenger and freight activity, mode shares, vehicle ownership rates, and even energy consumption by mode, particularly for shipping, aviation and trucking. This may be due in part to a lack of previous efforts to do such consistency-checking and “bench-marking.” We find that the four models differ in terms of the relative roles of various mitigation strategies to achieve a 2°C / 450 ppm CO2e target: the economics-based integrated assessment models favor the use of low carbon fuels as the primary mitigation option followed by efficiency improvements, whereas transport-only and expert-based models favor efficiency improvements of vehicles followed by mode shifts. We offer recommendations for future modeling improvements focusing on (1) reducing data gaps; (2) translating the findings from this study into relevant policy implications such as feasibility of current policy goals, additional policy targets needed, regional vs. global reductions, etc.; (3) modeling strata of demographic groups to improve understanding of vehicle ownership levels, travel behavior, and urban vs. rural considerations; and (4) conducting coordinated efforts in aligning input assumptions and historical data, policy analysis, and modeling insights.","Elsevier","","Pacific Northwest National Lab.

"A simulation approach to estimate energy savings potential of occupant behavior measures","Sun, Kaiyu; Hong, Tianzhen","29 ENERGY PLANNING, POLICY, AND ECONOMY; 32 ENERGY CONSERVATION, CONSUMPTION, AND UTILIZATION","Occupant behavior in buildings is a leading factor influencing energy use in buildings. Low-cost behavioral solutions have demonstrated significant potential energy savings. Estimating the behavioral savings potential is important for a more effective design of behavior change interventions, which in turn will support more effective energy-efficiency policies. This study introduces a simulation approach to estimate the energy savings potential of occupant behavior measures. First it defines five typical occupant behavior measures in office buildings, then simulates and analyzes their individual and integrated impact on energy use in buildings. The energy performance of the five behavior measures was evaluated using EnergyPlus simulation for a real office building across four typical U.S. climates and two vintages. The Occupancy Simulator was used to simulate the occupant movement in each zone with inputs from the site survey of the case building. Based on the simulation results, the occupant behavior measures can achieve overall site energy savings as high as 22.9% for individual measures and up to 41.0% for integrated measures. Although energy savings of behavior measures would vary depending upon many factors, the presented simulation approach is robust and can be adopted for other studies aiming to quantify occupant behavior impact on building performance.","Elsevier","","Lawrence Berkeley National Lab.

Systems were evaluated for reducing indoor concentrations of outdoor particles in summer and fall/winter, ozone in summer, and particles from stir-fry cooking. Air exchange rate was measured continuously. Energy use was estimated for year-round operation in California. Exhaust ventilation without enhanced filtration provided indoor PM 2.5 that was 70% lower than outdoors. Supply ventilation with MERV13 filtration provided slightly less protection, whereas supply MERV16 filtration reduced PM 2.5 by 97-98% relative to outdoors. Supply filtration systems used little energy but provided no benefits for indoor-generated particles. Systems with MERV13-16 fil ter in the recirculating heating and cooling unit (FAU) operating continuously or 20 min/h reduced PM 2.5 by 93-98%. Across all systems, removal percentages were higher for ultrafine particles and lower for black carbon, relative to PM 2.5 . Indoor ozone was 3-4% of outdoors for all systems except an electronic air cleaner that produced ozone.

"How to sustainably feed a microbe: Strategies for biological production of carbon-based commodities with renewable electricity","Butler, Caitlyn S.; Lovley, Derek R.","59 BASIC BIOLOGICAL SCIENCES; 60 APPLIED LIFE SCIENCES; 32 ENERGY CONSERVATION, CONSUMPTION, AND UTILIZATION; renewable energy storage; artificial photosynthesis; CO2 sequestration; biocommodities; microbial electrosynthesis","As interest and application of renewable energy grows, strategies are needed to align the asynchronous supply and demand. Microbial metabolisms are a potentially sustainable mechanism for transforming renewable electrical energy into biocommodities that are easily stored and transported. Acetogens and methanogens can reduce carbon dioxide to organic products including methane, acetic acid, and ethanol. The library of biocommodities is expanded when engineered metabolisms of acetogens are included. Typically, electrochemical systems are employed to integrate renewable energy sources with biological systems for production of carbon-based commodities. Within these systems, there are three prevailing mechanisms for delivering electrons to microorganisms for the conversion of carbon dioxide to reduce organic compounds: (1) electrons can be delivered to microorganisms via H<sub>2</sub> produced separately in a electrolyzer, (2) H<sub>2</sub> produced at a cathode can convey electrons to microorganisms supported on the cathode surface, and (3) a cathode can directly feed electrons to microorganisms. Each of these strategies has advantages and disadvantages that must be considered in designing full-scale processes. Furthermore, this review considers the evolving understanding of each of these approaches and the state of design for advancing these strategies toward viability.","Frontiers Research Foundation","","Univ. of Massachusetts, Amherst, MA (United States)","USDOE Office of Science (SC)","","United States","2016-11-28T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: Frontiers in Microbiology; Journal Volume: 7","","Medium: ED; Size: 6 p.","","","AR0000087","Journal ID: ISSN 1664-302X","10.3389/fmicb.2016.01879","","2021-07-23T00:00:00Z","1362110","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/1362110","https://www.osti.gov/servlets/purl/1362110","Frontiers in Microbiology","","7"
"Data analytics and optimization of an ice-based energy storage system for commercial buildings","Luo, Na; Hong, Tianzhen; Li, Hui; Jia, Ruoxi; Weng, Wenguo","32 ENERGY CONSERVATION, CONSUMPTION, AND UTILIZATION","Ice-based thermal energy storage (TES) systems can shift peak cooling demand and reduce operational energy costs (with time-of-use rates) in commercial buildings. The accurate prediction of the cooling load, and the optimal control strategy for managing the charging and discharging of a TES system, are two critical elements to improving system performance and achieving energy cost savings. This study utilizes data-driven analytics and modeling to holistically understand the operation of an ice–based TES system in a shopping mall, calculating the system’s performance using actual measured data from installed meters and sensors. Results show that there is significant savings potential when the current operating strategy is improved by appropriately scheduling the operation of each piece of equipment of the TES system, as well as by determining the amount of charging and discharging for each day. A novel optimal control strategy, determined by an optimization algorithm of Sequential Quadratic Programming, was developed to minimize the TES system’s operating costs. Three heuristic strategies were also investigated for comparison with our proposed strategy, and the results demonstrate the superiority of our method to the heuristic strategies in terms of total energy cost savings. Specifically, the optimal strategy yields energy costs of up to 11.3% per day and 9.3% per month compared with current operational strategies. A one-day-ahead hourly load prediction was also developed using machine learning algorithms, which facilitates the adoption of the developed data analytics and optimization of the control strategy in a real TES system operation.","Elsevier","","Lawrence Berkeley National Lab.

"Energy savings opportunities in the global digital television transition","Park, Won Young; Gopal, Anand; Phadke, Amol","32 ENERGY CONSERVATION, CONSUMPTION, AND UTILIZATION; Digital television transition; Analog switch off; TV energy efficiency; Market transformation; LED backlit LCD TVs","Globally, terrestrial television (TV) broadcasting is in the midst of a complete transition to digital signals. The last analog terrestrial broadcast is expected to be switched off in the early 2020s. This transition presents huge energy savings opportunities that have thus far been ignored. Digital TV switchovers have likely increased energy consumption as countries have completed transitions by providing digital TV converters to analog TV users, which increase energy consumption and extend the life of energy-inefficient analog TVs. We find that if analog TVs were retired at the time of a digital switchover and replaced with super-efficient flat-panel TVs, such as light-emitting diode (LED) backlit liquid crystal display (LCD) TVs, there is a combined electricity savings potential of 32 terawatt hours [TWh] per year in countries that have not yet completed their digital TV transition. In view of these findings as well as the dramatic drops of super-efficient TV prices and the unique early-retirement opportunity resulting from cessation of terrestrial analog broadcasts, TV-exchange programs would easily and substantially advance energy efficiency.","Springer","","Lawrence Berkeley National Lab.

What are the characteristics of the systems with low-prices? Here, using detailed characteristics of 42,611 small-scale (<15 kW) PV systems installed in 15 U.S. states during 2013, we identify the most important factors that make a system likely to be low-priced (LP). Comparing LP and non-LP systems, we find statistically significant differences in nearly all characteristics for which we have data. Logit and probit model results robustly indicate that LP systems are associated with: markets with few active installers; experienced installers; customer ownership; large systems; retrofits; and thin-film, low-efficiency, and Chinese modules. We also find significant differences across states, with LP systems much more likely to occur in some states, such as Arizona, New Jersey, and New Mexico, and less likely in others, such as California. Our focus on the left tail of the price distribution provides implications for policy that are distinct from recent studies of mean prices. While those studies find that PV subsidies increase mean prices, we find that subsidies also generate LP systems. PV subsidies appear to simultaneously shift and broaden the price distribution. Much of this broadening occurs in a particular location, northern California.","Elsevier","","Lawrence Berkeley National Lab.

"An Energy-Efficient Method for Direct-Contact Ultrasonic Cloth Drying","Peng, Chang; Momen, Ayyoub M.; Moghaddam, Saeed","32 ENERGY CONSERVATION, CONSUMPTION, AND UTILIZATION; ultrasonic cloth drying; duty cycle; modulating frequency; energy factor","In this paper, a novel ultrasonic transducer driving method, in which the power supply to the transducer is regulated by a binary modulating signal, is introduced for the first time for use in direct-contact ultrasonic drying of fabrics. First, the drying characteristics of different fabrics on two types of transducers are studied using continuous transducer driving mode. Then, the effects of duty cycle and frequency of modulating power signals on fabric drying characteristics are investigated. The energy efficiency of the proposed transducer driving method is compared with that of the continuous transducer driving mode. The results suggest that drying using a modulating signal consists of nonlinear and linear regimes similar to those of the continuous driving mode. The results also show that drying time of a fabric depends not only on the fabric type, but also on the duty cycle and the modulating frequency. However, there exists a critical duty cycle beyond which the drying time does not change. The proposed transducer driving method is more energy-efficient compared to continuous driving mode, consuming 7–16 times less energy. Finally, higher energy efficiencies maybe achieved by operating the transducer at higher modulating frequencies and shorter duty cycles.","Elsevier","","Univ. of Florida, Gainesville, FL (United States); Oak Ridge National Lab.

Some problems with this conventional regime can be readily observed: first, people have differing opinions of the appropriate target temperature; and second, conditioning a whole building requires much more energy than conditioning the air immediately surrounding the occupants. In contrast to most conventional approaches to decreasing energy consumption, personal cooling offers a plug and play solution by providing localized space conditioning directly to individuals. Furthermore, this shift in perspective, from the room air temperature to the individual, opens new possibilities to enable more sustainable cooling architectures for energy efficient space and building design at lower cost.","IEA Heat Pump Centre","","Oak Ridge National Lab.

"Increased light-use efficiency in northern terrestrial ecosystems indicated by CO<sub>2</sub> and greening observations","Ricciuto, Daniel M.; Mao, Jiafu; Shi, Xiaoying","58 GEOSCIENCES; 32 ENERGY CONSERVATION, CONSUMPTION, AND UTILIZATION","Observations show an increasing amplitude in the seasonal cycle of CO<sub>2</sub> (ASC) north of 45°N of 56 ± 9.8% over the last 50 years and an increase in vegetation greenness of 7.5 - 15% in high northern latitudes since the 1980s. However, the causes of these changes remain uncertain. Historical simulations from terrestrial biosphere models in the Multiscale Synthesis and Terrestrial Model Intercomparison Project are compared to the ASC and greenness observations, using the TM3 atmospheric transport model to translate surface fluxes into CO<sub>2</sub> concentrations. We find that the modeled change in ASC is too small but the mean greening trend is generally captured. Modeled increases in greenness are primarily driven by warming, whereas ASC changes are primarily driven by increasing CO<sub>2</sub>. We suggest that increases in ecosystem-scale light use efficiency (LUE) have contributed to the observed ASC increase but are underestimated by current models. We highlight potential mechanisms that could increase modeled LUE.","American Geophysical Union","","Oak Ridge National Lab.

This policy scenario provides a backdrop for understanding China’s electric generation mix over the coming century under several CCS availability scenarios: CCS is fully available for commercial-scale deployment by 2025; by 2050; by 2075; and CCS is unavailable for use in meeting the modelled mitigation targets through 2100. Without having CCS available, the Chinese electric power sector turns to significant use of nuclear, wind, and solar to meet growing demands and emissions targets, at a cost. Should large-scale CCS deployment be delayed in China by 25 years, the modeled per-ton cost of climate change mitigation is projected to be roughly $420/tC (2010 US dollars) by 2050, relative to $360/tC in the case in which CCS is available to deploy by 2025, a 16% increase. Once CCS is available for commercial use, mitigation costs for the two cases converge, equilibrating by 2085. However, should CCS be entirely unavailable to deploy in China, the mitigation cost spread, compared to the 2025 case, doubles by 2075 ($580/tC and $1130/tC respectively), and triples by 2100 ($1050/tC vs. $3200/tC). However, while delays in CCS availability may have short-term impacts on China’s overall per-ton cost of meeting the emissions reduction target evaluated here, as well as total mitigation costs, the carbon price is likely to approach the price path associated with the full CCS availability case within a decade of CCS deployment. Having CCS available before the end of the century, even under the delays examined here, could reduce the total amount of nuclear and renewable energy that must deploy, reducing the overall cost of meeting the emissions mitigation targets.","Elsevier","","Pacific Northwest National Lab.

A physically motivated approach is used to illustrate how selectively-engaging springs for hip adduction and ankle flexion predict benefits for three different flat ground walking gaits: human walking, human-like robot walking and crouched robot walking. Based on locomotion data, springs are designed and substantial reductions in power consumption are demonstrated using a bench dynamometer. These lessons are then applied to STEPPR (Sandia Transmission-Efficient Prototype Promoting Research), a fully actuated bipedal robot designed to explore the impact of tailored joint mechanisms on walking efficiency. Featuring high-torque brushless DC motors, efficient low-ratio transmissions, and high fidelity torque control, STEPPR provides the ability to incorporate novel joint-level mechanisms without dramatically altering high level control. Unique parallel elastic designs are incorporated into STEPPR, and walking data shows that hip adduction and ankle flexion springs significantly reduce the required actuator energy at those joints for several gaits. These results suggest that parallel joint springs offer a promising means of supporting quasi-static joint torques due to body mass during walking, relieving motors of the need to support these torques and substantially improving locomotive energy efficiency.","IEEE - ASME","","Sandia National Lab.

Consumption, inequality, and population have increased extremely fast, especially since about 1950, threatening to overwhelm the many critical functions and ecosystems of the Earth System. Changes in the Earth System, in turn, have important feedback effects on the Human System, with costly and potentially serious consequences. However, current models do not incorporate these critical feedbacks. Here, we argue that in order to understand the dynamics of either system, Earth System Models must be coupled with Human System Models through bidirectional couplings representing the positive, negative, and delayed feedbacks that exist in the real systems. In particular, key Human System variables, such as demographics, inequality, economic growth, and migration, are not coupled with the Earth System but are instead driven by exogenous estimates, such as United Nations population projections.This makes current models likely to miss important feedbacks in the real Earth–Human system, especially those that may result in unexpected or counterintuitive outcomes, and thus requiring different policy interventions from current models. Lastly, the importance and imminence of sustainability challenges, the dominant role of the Human System in the Earth System, and the essential roles the Earth System plays for the Human System, all call for collaboration of natural scientists, social scientists, and engineers in multidisciplinary research and modeling to develop coupled Earth–Human system models for devising effective science-based policies and measures to benefit current and future generations.","China Science Publishing","","Pacific Northwest National Lab.

"Lattice Boltzmann modeling of self-propelled Leidenfrost droplets on ratchet surfaces","Li, Qing; Kang, Qinjun J.; Francois, Marianne M.; Hu, A. J.","97 MATHEMATICS AND COMPUTING; 32 ENERGY CONSERVATION, CONSUMPTION, AND UTILIZATION; Energy Sciences","Here in this paper, the self-propelled motion of Leidenfrost droplets on ratchet surfaces is numerically investigated with a thermal multiphase lattice Boltzmann model with liquid-vapor phase change. The capability of the model for simulating evaporation is validated via the D<sup>2</sup> law. Using the model, we first study the performances of Leidenfrost droplets on horizontal ratchet surfaces. It is numerically shown that the motion of self-propelled Leidenfrost droplets on ratchet surfaces is owing to the asymmetry of the ratchets and the vapor flows beneath the droplets. It is found that the Leidenfrost droplets move in the direction toward the slowly inclined side from the ratchet peaks, which agrees with the direction of droplet motion in experiments [Linke et al., Phys. Rev. Lett., 2006, 96, 154502]. Moreover, the influences of the ratchet aspect ratio are investigated. For the considered ratchet surfaces, a critical value of the ratchet aspect ratio is approximately found, which corresponds to the maximum droplet moving velocity. Furthermore, the processes that the Leidenfrost droplets climb uphill on inclined ratchet surfaces are also studied. Lastly, numerical results show that the maximum inclination angle at which a Leidenfrost droplet can still climb uphill successfully is affected by the initial radius of the droplet.","Royal Society of Chemistry","","Los Alamos National Lab.

"Coupling fast fluid dynamics and multizone airflow models in Modelica Buildings library to simulate the dynamics of HVAC systems","Tian, Wei; Sevilla, Thomas Alonso; Zuo, Wangda; Sohn, Michael D.","32 ENERGY CONSERVATION, CONSUMPTION, AND UTILIZATION","Historically, multizone models are widely used in building airflow and energy performance simulations due to their fast computing speed. However, multizone models assume that the air in a room is well mixed, consequently limiting their application. In specific rooms where this assumption fails, the use of computational fluid dynamics (CFD) models may be an alternative option. Previous research has mainly focused on coupling CFD models and multizone models to study airflow in large spaces. While significant, most of these analyses did not consider the coupled simulation of the building airflow with the building's Heating, Ventilation, and Air-Conditioning (HVAC) systems. This paper tries to fill the gap by integrating the models for HVAC systems with coupled multizone and CFD simulations for airflows, using the Modelica simul ation platform. To improve the computational efficiency, we incorporated a simplified CFD model named fast fluid dynamics (FFD). We first introduce the data synchronization strategy and implementation in Modelica. Then, we verify the implementation using two case studies involving an isothermal and a non-isothermal flow by comparing model simulations to experiment data. Afterward, we study another three cases that are deemed more realistic. This is done by attaching a variable air volume (VAV) terminal box and a VAV system to previous flows to assess the capability of the models in studying the dynamic control of HVAC systems. Finally, we discuss further research needs on the coupled simulation using the models.","Elsevier","","Lawrence Berkeley National Lab.

"Micro-environmental control for efficient local cooling","Kong, Meng; Dang, Thong Q.; Zhang, Jianshun; Khalifa, H. Ezzat","32 ENERGY CONSERVATION, CONSUMPTION, AND UTILIZATION; micro-environment; thermal balance; CFD; local cooling","Micro-environment is hereby defined as the air space and environment around a person that directly impacts his/her thermal sensation. Most existing HVAC systems condition the air of the entire room including the unoccupied space, which leaves a big potential to save energy. This study aims at evaluating the performance of three existing air terminal devices (ATDs) to locally remove enough heat from the micro-environment to manage the thermal balance so as not to sacrifice thermal comfort when the ambient unoccupied space temperature is increased by 2.2 °C from 23.9 °C to 26.1 °C in the summer to reduce the external cooling load. A computational fluid dynamics (CFD) model was developed, validated by full-scale chamber tests and applied to evaluate different configurations of the ATDs for local cooling. Results show that the predicted performance agreed well with the measurements, and the selected ATD, with only 50 W cooling power, was always able to remove a sufficient amount of heat from the microenvironment in a room of raised temperature, when the manikin was moved inside a semicircle movement range. The cooling performance of the jet was increased more by increasing the supply air flow rate than reducing the supply temperature and was highly dependent on the shooting angle. Finally, the heat flux from the manikin surface is very sensitive to the surface temperature and furniture placement, and proper specification of the surface temperature is crucial for the CFD simulation to match the measured results.","Elsevier","","Syracuse Univ., NY (United States)","USDOE Advanced Research Projects Agency - Energy (ARPA-E)","","United States","2017-06-01T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: Building and Environment; Journal Volume: 118; Journal Issue: C","","Medium: ED; Size: p. 300-312","","","AR0000526","Journal ID: ISSN 0360-1323","10.1016/j.buildenv.2017.03.040","","2018-06-01T00:00:00Z","1349652","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/1349652","https://www.osti.gov/servlets/purl/1349652","Building and Environment","C","118"

The comparison is conducted under conditions that the CV and CC operations result in the same amounts of input charge and within identical charging phase durations. We present two electrical circuit models to simulate energy consumption in charging phase: one is a simple RC circuit model, and the other a transmission line circuit model. We built and tested a CDI cell to validate the transmission line model, and performed a series of experiments to compare CV versus CC operation under the condition of equal applied charge and charging duration. The experiments show that CC mode consumes energy at 33.8 kJ per mole of ions removed, which is only 28% of CV mode energy consumption (120.6 kJ/mol), but achieves similar level of salt removals. Lastly, together, the models and experiment support our major conclusion that CC is more energy efficient than CV for equal charge and charging duration. The models also suggest that the lower energy consumption of CC in charging is due to its lower resistive dissipation.","Elsevier","","Lawrence Livermore National Lab.

"Maximization of Platoon Formation Through Centralized Routing and Departure Time Coordination","Sokolov, Vadim; Larson, Jeffrey; Munson, Todd; Auld, Josh; Karbowski, Dominik","42 ENGINEERING; 32 ENERGY CONSERVATION, CONSUMPTION, AND UTILIZATION","Platooning allows vehicles to travel with a small intervehicle distance in a coordinated fashion because of vehicle-to-vehicle connectivity. When applied at a larger scale, platooning creates significant opportunities for energy savings because of reduced aerodynamic drag, as well as increased road capacity and a reduction in congestion resulting from shorter vehicle headways. These potential savings are maximized, however, if platooning-capable vehicles spend most of their travel time within platoons. Ad hoc platoon formation may not ensure a high rate of platoon driving. This paper considers here the problem of central coordination of platooning-capable vehicles. Coordination of their routes and departure times can maximize the fuel savings afforded by platooning vehicles. The resulting problem is a combinatorial optimization problem that considers the platoon coordination and vehicle routing problems simultaneously. The methodology is demonstrated through evaluation of the benefits of a coordinated solution and comparison with the uncoordinated case when platoons form only in an ad hoc manner. The coordinated and uncoordinated scenarios are compared on a grid network with various assumptions about demand and the time vehicles are willing to wait.","National Academy of Sciences, Engineering and Medicine","","Argonne National Lab.

However, the long-term contribution of wind to future energy supply, and the degree to which policy support is necessary to motivate higher levels of deployment, depends - in part - on the future costs of both onshore and offshore wind. In this paper, we summarize the results of an expert elicitation survey of 163 of the world's foremost wind experts, aimed at better understanding future costs and technology advancement possibilities. Results suggest significant opportunities for cost reductions, but also underlying uncertainties. Under the median scenario, experts anticipate 24-30% reductions by 2030 and 35-41% reductions by 2050 across the three wind applications studied. Costs could be even lower: experts predict a 10% chance that reductions will be more than 40% by 2030 and more than 50% by 2050. Insights gained through expert elicitation complement other tools for evaluating cost-reduction potential, and help inform policy and planning, R & D and industry strategy.","Nature Publishing Group","","Lawrence Berkeley National Lab.

The system is intended to be assembled and operated by developing-world households that lack sufficient access to electricity, thereby enabling LED lighting or mobile phone charging on demand. Lab-scale hardware is used to assess the performance of individual cell components. It is found that coffee filter paper is an effective low-cost separator. Carbon felt is a low-cost electrode material, and its performance and wetting by the electrolyte solution is greatly improved by pre-treatment with sulfuric acid. The carbon felt does not degrade after a week of daily use. By using these components, performance of the system is significantly improved over the previous baseline, with power density more than doubling to 40 mW cm<sup>-2</sup>, and iron utilization improving from 78% to 88%. The operating cost is estimated to be less than US$0.03 per mobile phone charge. Based on the lab-scale results, a stand-alone prototype consumer product is designed, fabricated, and tested. It successfully provides 2.5 h of LED illumination while consuming 200 mL of electrolyte solution via gravity feed.

Consequently, continued development relies on understanding their power consumption. Our work is a survey of GPU power modeling and profiling methods with increased detail on noteworthy efforts. Moreover, as direct measurement of GPU power is necessary for model evaluation and parameter initiation, internal and external power sensors are discussed. Hardware counters, which are low-level tallies of hardware events, share strong correlation to power use and performance. Statistical correlation between power and performance counters has yielded worthwhile GPU power models, yet the complexity inherent to GPU architectures presents new hurdles for power modeling. Developments and challenges of counter-based GPU power modeling is discussed. Often building on the counter-based models, research efforts for GPU power simulation, which make power predictions from input code and hardware knowledge, provide opportunities for optimization in programming or architectural design. Noteworthy strides in power simulations for GPUs are included along with their performance or functional simulator counterparts when appropriate.

"Life Cycle Assessment of Vehicle Lightweighting: A Physics-Based Model To Estimate Use-Phase Fuel Consumption of Electrified Vehicles","Kim, Hyung Chul; Wallington, Timothy J.","32 ENERGY CONSERVATION, CONSUMPTION, AND UTILIZATION; 29 ENERGY PLANNING, POLICY, AND ECONOMY; 33 ADVANCED PROPULSION SYSTEMS","Assessing the life-cycle benefits of vehicle lightweighting requires a quantitative description of mass-induced fuel consumption (MIF) and fuel reduction values (FRVs). We have extended our physics-based model of MIF and FRVs for internal combustion engine vehicles (ICEVs) to electrified vehicles (EVs) including hybrid electric vehicles (HEVs), plug-in hybrid electric vehicles (PHEVs), and battery electric vehicles (BEVs). We illustrate the utility of the model by calculating MIFs and FRVs for 37 EVs and 13 ICEVs. BEVs have much smaller MIF and FRVs, both in the range 0.04-0.07 L<sub>e</sub>/(100 km 100 kg), than those for ICEVs which are in the ranges 0.19-0.32 and 0.16-0.22 L/(100 km 100 kg), respectively. The MIF and FRVs for HEVs and PHEVs mostly lie between those for ICEVs and BEVs. Powertrain resizing increases the FRVs for ICEVs, HEVs and PHEVs. Lightweighting EVs is less effective in reducing greenhouse gas emissions than lightweighting ICEVs, however the benefits differ substantially for different vehicle models. The physics-based approach outlined here enables model specific assessments for ICEVs, HEVs, PHEVs, and BEVs required to determine the optimal strategy for maximizing the life-cycle benefits of lightweighting the light-duty vehicle fleet.","American Chemical Society (ACS)","","Magna/Vehma International Inc., Troy, MI (United States); Ford Motor Company, Detroit, MI (United States)","USDOE Office of Energy Efficiency and Renewable Energy (EERE); USDOE Office of Fossil Energy (FE)","","United States","2016-08-17T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: Environmental Science and Technology; Journal Volume: 50; Journal Issue: 20","","Medium: ED; Size: p. 11226-11233","","","EE0005574","Journal ID: ISSN 0013-936X","10.1021/acs.est.6b02059","","2021-07-26T00:00:00Z","1424998","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/1424998","https://www.osti.gov/servlets/purl/1424998","Environmental Science and Technology","20","50"

Climate change is a problem that must be solved. The primary cause of this problem is burning of fossil fuels to generate energy. A dramatic reduction in carbon emissions must happen soon, and a significant fraction of this reduction must come from the transportation sector. This paper reviews existing literature to assess the consensus of the scientific and engineering communities concerning the potential for the United States' light-duty transportation sector to meet a goal of 80% reduction in vehicle emissions and examine what it will take to meet this target. It is unlikely that reducing energy consumption in just vehicles with gasoline-based internal combustion drivetrains will be sufficient to meet GHG emission-reduction targets. This paper explores what additional benefits are possible through the adoption of alternative energy sources, looking at three possible on-vehicle energy carriers: carbon-based fuels, hydrogen, and batteries.","Materials Research Society - Cambridge University Press","","National Renewable Energy Lab.

"Efficiency analysis of semi-open sorption heat pump systems","Gluesenkamp, Kyle R.; Chugh, Devesh; Abdelaziz, Omar; Moghaddam, Saeed","32 ENERGY CONSERVATION, CONSUMPTION, AND UTILIZATION; sorption; absorption; semi-open; efficiency; novel cycle","Sorption systems traditionally fall into two categories: closed (heat pumps and chillers) and open (dehumidification). Recent work has explored the possibility of semi-open systems, which can perform heat pumping or chilling while utilizing ambient humidity as the working fluid of the cycle, and are still capable of being driven by solar, waste, or combustion heat sources. The efficiencies of closed and open systems are well characterized, and can typically be determined from four temperature s. In this work, the performance potential of semi-open systems is explored by adapting expressions for the efficiency of closed and open systems to the novel semi-open systems. A key new parameter is introduced, which involves five temperatures, since both the ambient dry bulb and ambient dew point are used. Furthermore, this additional temperature is necessary to capture the open absorber performance in terms of both the absorption of humidity and sensible heat transfer with surrounding air.","Elsevier","","Oak Ridge National Lab.
