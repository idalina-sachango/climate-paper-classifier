"Part I: Predicting performance of Purolite A532E resins for remediation of comingled contaminants in groundwater","Saslow, Sarah A.; Levitskaia, Tatiana G.; Cordova, Elsa; Avalos, Nancy M.; Boglaienko, Daria; Fang, Yilin; Song, Xuehang; Lawter, Amanda R.; Emerson, Hilary P.; Szecsody, James E.; Johnson, Christian D.; Pearce, Carolyn I.; Freedman, Vicky L.; Mackley, Robert D.","12 MANAGEMENT OF RADIOACTIVE AND NON-RADIOACTIVE WASTES FROM NUCLEAR FACILITIES; pump-and-treat; uranium; technetium; anion exchange; Hanford","Ion exchange (IX) resins are used in pump-and-treat (P&T) facilities to remove soluble groundwater contaminants. However, natural anions present at concentrations orders of magnitude higher than contaminants can compete for IX sites and impact resin lifecycles. Here, the Hanford Site’s 200 West Area P&T facility (Washington State, USA) was selected as a case study because it currently uses two IX resins: Purolite® A532E (A532E) to remove pertechnetate (TcO<sub>4</sub><sup>-</sup>) and DOWEX 21K (DOWEX) to remove uranium from groundwater. Nitrate (NO<sub>3</sub><sup>-</sup>), sulfate (SO<sub>4</sub><sup>2-</sup>), chloride (Cl<sup>-</sup>), and carbonate (CO<sub>3</sub><sup>2-</sup>) anions have been identified to potentially compete for A532E and DOWEX IX sites. Hanford-relevant anion groundwater concentrations were used to design a series of laboratory-scale batch experiments to evaluate the impact of competing anions on resin performance and potential kinetic effects. These data are then modeled to obtain Cl--normalized equilibrium exchange coefficients (K) needed to predict IX resin performance. The work is presented in two parts, with IX performance evaluated for A532E in Part I and DOWEX in Part II. Part I results demonstrate that TcO<sub>4</sub><sup>-</sup> uptake is not impacted by NO<sub>3</sub><sup>-</sup>, SO<sub>4</sub><sup>2-</sup>, Cl<sup>-</sup>, CO<sub>3</sub><sup>2-</sup> (as HCO<sub>3</sub><sup>-</sup>) and U(VI) carbonate anions, with K<sub>TcO4-/Cl-</sub> > 4,000, likely due to the high selectivity of A532E trihexylammonium sites for the large, weakly hydrated TcO<sub>4</sub><sup>-</sup> anion. Other anion K values were K<sub>NO3-/Cl-</sub> = 20, K<sub>SO4--/Cl-</sub> = 0.2, K<sub>HCO3-/Cl-</sub> = 0.09, K<sub>U/Cl-</sub> = 370–1000. These K values provide conservative parameters for predicting A532E performance, and demonstrate that, under these test conditions, A532E will remove TcO<sub>4</sub><sup>-</sup> from current and future influent streams to meet groundwater treatment objectives.","Elsevier","","Pacific Northwest National Lab.

"Alternative reductants for foam control during vitrification of high-iron High Level Waste (HLW) feeds","Rigby, Jessica C.; Dixon, Derek R.; Kloužek, Jaroslav; Pokorný, Richard; Thompson, Paul B.J.; Scrimshire, A.; Kruger, Albert A.; Bell, Anthony M.T.; Bingham, Paul A.","12 MANAGEMENT OF RADIOACTIVE AND NON-RADIOACTIVE WASTES FROM NUCLEAR FACILITIES; Cold cap; Vitrification; Redox; Multivalent species; Secondary foaming","Foaming during vitrification of radioactive waste in Joule-Heated Ceramic Melters (JHCM) is exacerbated by trapping of evolving gases, such as CO<sub>2</sub>, NO<sub>x</sub> and O<sub>2</sub>, beneath a viscous reaction layer. Foaming restricts heat transfer during melting. Sucrose is employed as the baseline additive at the Hanford site in Washington State, USA to reduce foaming. Alternative carbon-based reductant additives were explored in simulated, inactive Hanford high-iron HLW-NG-Fe2 feeds, for both their effect on foaming and to give insight to the behaviour of multivalent species in glass melts under different redox conditions. Graphite, coke (93% C), formic acid and HEDTA additives were compared with sucrose, and a feed with no additive. Graphite and coke additions proved most effective in reducing the maximum foam volume by 51 ± 3% and 54 ± 2%, respectively, compared with 24 ± 5% for sucrose. Lower foaming could result in more efficient vitrification in JHCMs. Reductants also affected redox ratios in the multivalent species present in the feed. The order of reduction, Mn<sup>3+</sup>/Mn<sup>2+</sup> > Cr<sup>6+</sup>/Cr<sup>3+</sup> > Ce<sup>3+</sup>/Ce<sup>4+</sup> > Fe<sup>3+</sup>/Fe<sup>2+</sup> was as predicted on the basis of their redox potentials. There is less reduction overall, particularly in the Fe<sup>3+</sup> → Fe<sup>2+</sup>, than predicted by the calculations, attributed to the oxygenated atmosphere of the experiments.","Elsevier","","Pacific Northwest National Lab.

While several studies have investigated their interactions with alkali and alkaline earth metals, no studies have probed their interactions with the actinide elements. This work describes a system containing U60Ox30, [((UO2)(O2))60(C2O4)30]60-, and neptunium(V) as a function of neptunium concentration. Ultra-small and small angle X-ray scattering were used to observe these interactions in the aqueous phase, and X-ray diffraction was used to observe solid products. The results show that neptunium induces aggregation of U60Ox30 when the neptunium concentration is ≤ 10 mM, whereas (NpO2)2C2O4·6H2O(cr) and studtite ultimately form at 15–25 mM neptunium. Finally, the latter result suggests that neptunium coordinates with the bridging oxalate ligands in U60Ox30, leaving metastable uranyl peroxide species in solution, and is an important finding given the potential application of uranyl peroxide nanoclusters in the recycling of used nuclear fuel.","ChemPubSoc Europe","","Univ. of Notre Dame, IN (United States); Argonne National Lab.

As part of an effort to understand the conditions during a 50-year period, a three-dimensional computational fluid dynamics (CFD) of the unsealed canisters packed with spent fuel in the storage facility was constructed, this CFD model is coupled with radiolytic chemical reactions associated with water vapor and other species. The coupled model is simulated over a range of sensitivity parameters for the fuel decay heat, relative humidity, and oxyhydroxide film thickness for undried and fully-dried fuel. The most important parameter was the initial fuel decay heat. Over the range of cases, the hydrogen and nitric acid concentrations are low enough no significant impact is expected.","Elsevier","","Idaho National Lab.

"Introduction of the Adding and Doubling Method for Solving Bateman Equations for Nuclear Fuel Depletion","Calvin, Olin W; Ganapol, Barry D.; Borrelli, R. A.","11 NUCLEAR FUEL CYCLE AND FUEL MATERIALS; 12 MANAGEMENT OF RADIOACTIVE AND NON-RADIOACTIVE WASTES FROM NUCLEAR FACILITIES; Adding and Doubling Method (ADM); Chebyshev Rational Approximation Method (CRAM); Bateman equations; depletion","This paper introduces and evaluates the Adding and Doubling Method (ADM) for solving the Bateman equations for depletion systems with varying numbers of nuclides and compares it to the Chebyshev Rational Approximation Method (CRAM), both implemented in the reactor physics analysis application Griffin. ADM, when applied to the Crank-Nicolson Finite Difference method, can produce results comparable in accuracy and precision to CRAM with comparable run times for systems with 35 or 297 nuclides. For systems with more than 300 nuclides, the matrix-matrix operations required by ADM are significantly more costly than the matrix-vector operations required by CRAM, making CRAM the more efficient method for systems with large numbers of nuclides. ADM is an accurate method that maintains other advantages over CRAM in that it does not depend on pre-generated coefficients or require complex number operations. ADM also manages to outperform CRAM by a factor of more than 250 in terms of run time for depletion systems that require multiple Bateman solves while the depletion matrix and time step size remain constant over all depletion intervals.","Taylor & Francis","","Idaho National Lab.

The purpose of this study is to integrate common Machine Learning (ML) algorithms such as Gaussian Process Regression (GPR), support vector regression (SVR), and artificial neural network (ANN) models into Gekko to solve data based optimization problems. Uncertainty quantification (UQ) is used alongside ML for better decision making. These methods include ensemble methods, model-specific methods, conformal predictions, and the delta method. An optimization problem involving nuclear waste vitrification is presented to demonstrate the benefit of ML in this field. ML models are compared against the current partial quadratic mixture (PQM) model in an optimization problem in Gekko. GPR with conformal uncertainty was chosen as the best substitute model as it had a lower mean squared error of 0.0025 compared to 0.018 and more confidently predicted a higher waste loading of 37.5 wt% compared to 34 wt%. The example problem shows that these tools can be used in similar industry settings where easier use and better performance is needed over classical approaches. Future works with these tools include expanding them with other regression models and UQ methods, and exploration into other optimization problems or dynamic control.</p>","MDPI AG","","Pacific Northwest National Lab.

"Effect of charge and anisotropic diffusivity on ion exchange kinetics in nuclear waste form materials","Li, Yulan; Hu, Shenyang; Montgomery, Robert O.; Grandjean, Agens; Besmann, Theodore M.; zur Loye, Hans-Conrad","12 MANAGEMENT OF RADIOACTIVE AND NON-RADIOACTIVE WASTES FROM NUCLEAR FACILITIES; ion exchange kinetics; ion charge; anisotropic diffusivity; nuclear waste form","Motifs of radionuclide absorption particles (absorbers or fillers) for the nuclear waste treatment usually have crystal structures with nano-sized tunnels for fast ion diffusion. On the other hand, the accumulation of ions generates an electric field which affects the ion diffusion. Therefore, the strong anisotropic kinetic properties and the electric field affect ion exchange kinetics, especially in an assembly of these particles which may block the fast diffusion tunnels for each other. In this work, we developed a mesoscale model to describe the effect of anisotropic kinetic properties and electric field on ion exchange kinetics. With the model we simulated the effect of anisotropic diffusivity, electrochemical potential, particle morphology, size and aggregation on ion exchange kinetics during batch experiments. Here, tt is found that 1) ion exchange results in charge accumulation inside the particle because different ions have different diffusivities and different diffusion driving forces. The electric neutrality is not preserved; 2) the electric field speeds up the slower diffusion ions (either uptake or release) and slows down the faster diffusion ions to reduce charge accumulation and maintains charge neutrality; 3) the ion exchange becomes very slow at the later stages because a) diffusion driving force (electrochemical gradient, Cs<sup>+</sup> concentration in the solution and Na<sup>+</sup> inside the particle) continuously decreases, as observed in batch experiments; and b) the diffusivity decreases due to the Cs<sup>+</sup> concentration dependence of ion diffusivity. This can explain the observed experimental phenomena that the radionuclide capacity usually cannot be reached; 4) for needle-like particle and their clusters, both surface area and diffusion distance along the direction with the fastest diffusivities have significant impact on the ion exchange kinetics.","Elsevier","","Pacific Northwest National Lab.

This paper describes the development of a model of the cold cap (the reacting melter feed floating on molten glass in a glass melter) that couples heat transfer with the feed-to-glass conversion kinetics. The model was applied to four melter feeds designed for high-level and low-activity nuclear waste feeds using the material properties, either measured or estimated, to obtain temperature and conversion distribution within the cold cap. The cold cap model, when coupled with a computational fluid dynamics model of a Joule-heated glass melter, allows the prediction of the glass production rate and power consumption. The results show reasonable agreement with the melting rates measured during pilot-scale melter tests.","American Ceramic Society","","Idaho National Lab.

Confusion in the wording “organic” and “inorganic” may have contributed to substitution of an organic kitty litter for an inorganic adsorbent used to prepare nuclear waste for disposal at an underground salt repository. Adsorbents prevent liquids like nitric acid from causing corrosion within the waste drums. However, combination of organic material with nitric acid can cause heat- and gas-generating reactions resulting in thermal runaway, rapid pressurization, and drum rupture. In 2014, waste Drum 68660 containing nitric acid-soaked organic kitty litter exploded and released transuranic waste into the repository. The cause of the accident was never identified. Here we show that the root cause of Drum 68660 igniting was restriction of the drum vent resulting in accelerated nitric acid chemistry, thermal runaway, and radiation dispersal.","Elsevier","","Pacific Northwest National Lab.

Variance-based global sensitivity analysis is applied to assess the effects of spatial heterogeneity using graph-based summary measures for scalar and time-varying quantities of interest. Behavior of the system with respect to spatial heterogeneity is further investigated using ratios of water fluxes. This analysis shows that spatial heterogeneity is a dominant uncertainty in predictions of repository performance which can be identified in global sensitivity analysis using proxy variables derived from graph descriptions of discrete fracture networks.

"Effects of time-dependent deformation of shale on the integrity of a geological nuclear waste repository","Sasaki, Tsubasa; Rutqvist, Jonny","12 MANAGEMENT OF RADIOACTIVE AND NON-RADIOACTIVE WASTES FROM NUCLEAR FACILITIES; nuclear waste disposal; shale; creep; Bentonite; coupled processes; geomechanics","Safety assessment of geological nuclear waste repositories is essential for the permanent disposal of spent nuclear fuels and high-level radioactive waste. The long-term integrity of the host rock as well as the engineered barrier system (e.g., bentonite buffer) surrounding nuclear waste canisters is of particular importance as decay heat from nuclear waste canisters, which will last over thousands of years, significantly disturbs the thermo-hydromechanical (THM) state of the repository. In this study, THM coupled simulations were carried out to investigate the effect of time-dependent deformation (i.e., creep) of shale on the long-term integrity of a generic subsurface nuclear waste repository. The Norton-Bailey creep model, which is also known as the Lemaitre-Menzel-Schreiner model, was employed to simulate the power-law type creep that is observed in shales. The TOUGH-FLAC simulator was employed for the THM coupled modeling of the repository. The objective of this study is to assess the effect of creep in different shales (i.e., high creep shale vs. low creep shale) on long-term stress and permeability changes in the repository. Results show potential advantages of constructing repositories in the high creep shale, as deviatoric stress levels in the formation decreased to zero in 100 years since the emplacement of nuclear waste canisters and the permeability also decreased to the undamaged, intrinsic levels in 10,000 years. Also, mean effective stress levels in the bentonite buffer increased by 100% in the high creep shale case relative to the low creep shale case at 10,000 years due to creep-induced contraction of the nuclear waste disposal tunnel. However, in earlier periods (e.g., 1000 years), the stress levels in the bentonite buffer were twice smaller in the high creep shale case than in the low creep shale case, which shows a tradeoff between the intermediate- (~1000 years) and long-term (>10,000 years) compaction levels in the bentonite buffer depending on the creep characteristics of the host shale.","Elsevier","","Lawrence Berkeley National Lab.

Similarly, there is increased interest in sensitivity analysis studies. These studies commonly use computational tools. However, providing a complementary sensitivity study of relevant analytical models can lead to a deeper analysis of a problem.

In this study, the effect of occluding the salt into a zeolite on water sorption/desorption was tested. Two zeolites were investigated: Na-Y and zeolite 4A. Na-Y was ineffective at occluding a high percentage of the salt at either 10 or 20wt% loading. Zeolite-4A was effective at occluding the salt with high efficiency at both loading levels. Weight gain in salt occluded zeolite-4A (SOZ) from water sorption at 20% relative humidity and 40°C was 17wt% for 10% SOZ and 10wt% for 20% SOZ. In both cases, neither deliquescence nor corrosion occurred over a period of 31 days. After hydration, most of the water could be driven off by heating the hydrated salt occluded zeolite to 530°C. However, some HCl forms during dehydration due to salt hydrolysis. Over a wide range of temperatures (320–700°C) and ramp rates (5, 10, and 20°C min<sup>-1</sup>), HCl formation was no more than 0.6% of the Cl<sup>-</sup> in the original salt.","Korean Radioactive Waste Society","","Idaho National Lab.

The rock specimens consisted of an organic-rich phosphorite, a bituminous marl, a chalk, and a sandstone. The sorption data for each lithology were fitted using a general composite surface complexation model (GC SCM) implemented in PHREEQC. Sorption data were also fitted by a non-mechanistic Langmuir sorption isotherm, which can be used as an alternative to the GC SCM to provide a more computationally efficient method for uranium sorption. This is because all the rocks tested have high pH/alkalinity/calcium buffering capacities that restrict groundwater chemistry variations, so that the use of a GC SCM is not advantageous. The mineralogy of the rocks points to several dominant sorption phases for uranyl (UO<sub>2</sub><sup>2+</sup>), including apatite, organic carbon, clays, and iron-bearing phases. The surface complexation parameters based on literature values for the minerals identified overestimate the uranium sorption capacities, so that for our application, an empirical approach that makes direct use of the experimental data to estimate mineral-specific sorption parameters appears to be more practical for predicting uranium sorption.","MDPI","","Los Alamos National Lab.

The 216-Z-9 (Z-9) unlined trench received over 4 x 10<sup>6</sup> L of mixed Pu processing waste from the Plutonium Finishing Plant (PFP) consisting of high ionic strength (~ 5 M nitrate, ~ 0.6 M aluminum), acidic (pH ~2.5) solutions, which also contained the organic solvents: tributyl phosphate (TBP), dibutyl butylphosphonate (DBBP), carbon tetrachloride (CCl4), and lard oil. A small fraction of Pu migrated deep into the subsurface vadose zone to depths of 37 m, but the mechanisms controlling Pu migration beneath the trench are unknown. In this study, we determined Pu partitioning behavior in a series of binary and ternary batch experiments containing aqueous, organic, and solid phases representative of the waste constituents and natural sediments of the Z-9 trench in order to develop a conceptual model for the transport of Pu in the subsurface. Our results show that Pu at equilibrium with low pH, high nitrate waste and in the presence of a TBP/organic phase can migrate as a Pu-TBP-nitrate complex in the organic phase as long as the low pH and high nitrate concentrations are maintained. Reducing the nitrate concentrations or increasing the pH will lead to Pu partitioning into the aqueous phase from the organic phase with subsequent sorption to native Hanford sediments. The results of this work suggest that Pu migration in the subsurface is likely driven by weak sorption of aqueous Pu under low pH conditions as well as the formation of Pu-TBP-nitrate complexes in the organic phase. Long-term Pu migration will be limited by the transient nature of the low pH conditions and the dispersion of the nitrate plume.","Elsevier","","Pacific Northwest National Lab.

If dual purpose canisters were to be used to dispose of spent nuclear fuel in a geological repository, they would be expected to eventually breach and be flooded with groundwater, and it is shown that some fraction of these canisters will achieve criticality. In order to evaluate the consequences of canisters going critical in a repository, an initial capability has been developed for estimating the quasi-static power level of a critical canister using loosely coupled multiphysics simulations. The low power level in a critical canister enables coupling through precomputed physics proxies. This calculated power level is then used to compute the change in the critical canister’s isotopic inventory as a function of time. Three as-loaded canisters are evaluated and two were found to have power levels below 4 kW, with a modest effect on the radiological inventory over time. This effort also shows that although some DPCs will have extremely peaked power shapes, the relatively low power and long-time scales result in relatively homogenized thermohydraulic properties in the water within the DPC.","Elsevier","","Oak Ridge National Lab.

For instance, license amendment requests (LARs) for SNF dry cask storage systems (DCSSs) are evaluated according to U.S. NRC standard review plans (SRPs). However, risk-informed LAR review strategies could improve the understanding of critical system modifications, and lead to more predictable, efficient, and consistent LAR review processes. A methodology to develop a risk-informed LAR review tool is presented. Although focused on DCSSs, this methodology can be used to develop similar tools for a broad spectrum of safety-relevant systems. The end product (i.e., the tool) includes a tree diagram to help visualize the review risk significances assigned to a predefined set of system modifications and supporting rationale documentation. Instructions support correct tool application and provide the user with a path to incorporate currently unevaluated modifications in the tool structure. The demonstration of the methodology leads to the conclusion that risk-informed reviews of DCSS LARs are possible, although the tool precision could benefit from additional risk information. Further, the results indicate that many typical LARs involve low-risk or medium-risk modifications.","Elsevier","","Idaho National Lab.

This process, inspired by existing chemistry, uses the aminopolycarboxylate N-(2-hydroxyethyl)ethylenediamine- N,N',N'-triacetic acid (HEDTA) to selectively separate the actinides by stripping them from the organic phase while leaving the lanthanides behind. HEDTA is used in this separation as it has been shown to exhibit faster extraction kinetics than other aminopolycarboxylates, but its lower coordination number can allow for the formation of higher order complexes with the typically 8- to 9-coordinate f-elements. ALSEP uses a carboxylic acid buffer in the aqueous phase to control the pH of the system during metal stripping, and this buffer has the ability to complex actinide(III) and lanthanide(III) ions. The presence of a previously uncharacterized ternary lanthanide-HEDTA-citrate complex was detected during single-phase spectroscopy experiments. A combination of partitioning experiments and spectrophotometric titrations led to the identification of a 1:1:1 complex containing a partially protonated citrate ligand and determination of the stability constant of its neodymium complex.","American Chemical Society","","Colorado School of Mines, Golden, CO (United States)","USDOE Office of Nuclear Energy (NE)","","United States","2022-04-19T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: ACS Omega Journal Volume: 7 Journal Issue: 17","","Medium: X; Size: p. 15005-15015","","","NE0008554","Journal ID: ISSN 2470-1343","10.1021/acsomega.2c00759","","2022-05-04T00:00:00Z","1863647","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/1863647","","ACS Omega","17","7"

Tests were seeded with either analcime, clinoptilolite, zeolite P1, or zeolite P2 to induce Stage III glass alteration behavior. The effect of several parameters on glass Stage III behavior was studied with consideration of several variables, including temperature (22 °C – 90 °C) and pH (floating or initially set using KOH at values from 9.5 to 11.5). Temporal solution data and solids characterization at the end of the experiments are reported. Solution data demonstrated the occurrence of a sustained rate acceleration at temperatures down to 40 °C and the activation energy for these Stage III rates was determined for both glasses. Three major secondary phases were identified at the end of the experiments for both glasses: zeolite P1, zeolite P2, and/or analcime (along with minor phases: zeolites, clays, carbonates). The identification of the crystalline phases at the end of the experiment often differed from the zeolite seed phase. In addition, the use of the Avrami equation showed unimpeded zeolite growth (3-dimensional) in certain conditions, suggesting that in certain conditions the glass dissolution rate is controlled by zeolite formation kinetics whereas in other conditions the glass corrosion process impeded zeolite formation kinetics. The morphological evolution of the samples revealed the growth of the zeolites which completely fill the intergranular space in the powder bed. These results are discussed with regards to previous seeded and unseeded Stage III dissolution rate experiments performed on low- and high-activity nuclear waste glasses.","Elsevier","","Pacific Northwest National Lab.

"Hydration-driven stabilization and volume collapse of grain boundaries in Mg2SiO4 forsterite predicted by first-principles simulations","Ghosh, Dipta B.; Karki, Bijaya B.; Wang, Jianwei","12 MANAGEMENT OF RADIOACTIVE AND NON-RADIOACTIVE WASTES FROM NUCLEAR FACILITIES","Grain boundaries in mantle minerals are of critical importance to geophysical and geochemical processes of the Earth’s interior. One of the fundamental issues is to understand how the water (H<sub>2</sub>O) component influences the properties of grain boundaries in silicate materials. Here, we report the results of the structure and stability of several tilt grain boundaries in Mg<sub>2</sub>SiO<sub>4</sub> forsterite over the pressure range 0 to 15 GPa using density functional theory-based first-principles simulations. Here, the results suggest greater energetic stability and hydration-driven volume collapse (negative excess volume) at zero pressure for the majority of hydrous grain boundaries relative to the anhydrous (dry) ones. All the hydrous grain boundaries become increasingly favorable at elevated pressures as the calculated hydration enthalpy systematically decreases with increasing pressure. The hydrous components at the interfacial regions are predominantly in the hydroxyl form and, to a lesser extent, in the molecular H<sub>2</sub>O form. Their calculated ratio ranges from 1.6 to 8.7 among the different grain boundary configurations. Our structural analysis also reveals that the hydroxyls are bound to either both Mg and Si or to Mg only. In comparison, the molecular species are bound only to Mg sites. Besides direct oxygen-hydrogen bonding, intermolecular hydrogen bonding becomes important with compression. On the basis of our results, we suggest that local atomic rearrangements caused by dissociative adsorption of water facilitate efficient compaction of the boundary interfaces, which, in turn, results in greater relative stability of hydrous grain boundaries. This means that water prefers to be incorporated within the grain boundaries over the bulk of silicate materials.","Mineralogical Society of America","","Louisiana State Univ., Baton Rouge, LA (United States)","USDOE Office of Science (SC), Basic Energy Sciences (BES); National Science Foundation (NSF)","","United States","2022-04-01T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: American Mineralogist; Journal Volume: 107; Journal Issue: 4","","Medium: ED; Size: p. 744-753","","","SC0016584; AC02-05CH11231; EAR 1014514; EAR 1764140","Journal ID: ISSN 0003-004X; TRN: US2305884","10.2138/am-2021-7732","","2023-04-10T00:00:00Z","1865518","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/1865518","https://www.osti.gov/servlets/purl/1865518","American Mineralogist","4","107"

This paper describes theoretical calculation of a transient temperature profile inside the IR-absorbing material considering IR refraction at the interface as well as IR adsorption and heat transfer inside the sample. Furthermore, this calculation explains the differences in peak positions and amplitudes of AFM-IR spectra from those of specular reflectance and extinction coefficient spectra. It also addresses the information depth of the AFM-IR characterization of bulk materials.

Optimizing instrument specifications can achieve this, here this is demonstrated by comparing limits of detection for key analytes when using Raman systems with 671 nm, 532 nm, and 405 nm excitation wavelengths. Generally, limits of detection decease (allowing the measurement of lower salt concentrations) with decreasing wavelength. Similarly, data collection times and averaging were optimized.

To further this goal, a three-dimensional (3D) multi-physics computational fluid dynamics (CFD) model is developed of the sealed DOE standard canisters. This 3D CFD model is one-way coupled with bulk gas radiolysis reactions considering sealed canisters with inert gas and possible trace amounts of air and water vapor. This study looks at the evolution of the thermal history of the canisters over a 50 year time period with a coupling to the chemical reactions occurring from radiolytic breakdown of residual water. A sensitivity study is then carried out over the parameters of the model including the fuel decay heat, residual water content, sealed pressure, canister external temperature, and canister emissivity. In pure helium, hydrogen generation rates are low, under 10 ppm, but hydrogen generation rates are affected greatly by the presence of even 1% residual air, increasing by 50-plus-fold, and nitric acid generation with residual air also occurs ranging from 500 to 4000 ppm after 50 years. The fuel decay heat and the residual water content show the most importance in the generation of hydrogen gas in pure air, and for nitric acid with a residual air condition. External temperature, canister emissivity and sealed pressure all show minor sensitivity effects to the generation of potentially harmful species.","Elsevier","","Idaho National Lab.

Our study indicates that the conversion processes, which include gas-evolving reactions, dissolution of crystalline phases, and primary foam expansion and collapse, are interconnected and influenced by the feed’s thermal history. The fraction of dissolved silica was adopted as a measure of the extent of conversion inside the cold cap—the floating layer of feed material on the top surface of the melt in an electric melter. The interface between the cold cap and the free-flowing melt below was associated with a constant fraction of dissolved silica. The estimated viscosity of glass-forming melt at this interface lies within a narrow range for the feeds studied.","Elsevier","","Idaho National Lab.

These additives have been used to lower the glass melting point, suppress the macroscopic phase separation, and increase the chemical durability of glasses. Small-angle neutron scattering was used to elucidate the effect of the additives on the nanoscopic structure along with macro- and atomic-scale observations obtained using neutron imaging and X-ray diffraction, respectively. The borosilicate glass made without Na<sub>2</sub>O formed a microphase-separated structure of SiO<sub>2</sub>- and B<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub>-rich domains approximately 100 nm in size, and the material was homogeneous at length scales up to millimeters. With the addition of increasing amounts of Na<sub>2</sub>O, the domain spacing decreased. Introducing CaO/ZnO additives induced inhomogeneities in the glass, such as void structures several nanometers in size, although the inhomogeneity was suppressed by the coaddition of Li<sub>2</sub>O. These results provide insights into the performance of host glasses for HLLW vitrification. Incorporating HLLW into glasses is likely to cause changes in the nanoscopic structure of host glasses similar to those revealed here.","Elsevier","","Oak Ridge National Lab.

"On the dissolution of a borosilicate glass with the use of isotopic tracing – Insights into the mechanism for the long-term dissolution rate","Strachan, Denis M.; Neeway, James J.; Pederson, Larry R.; Schreiber, Daniel K.; Mitroshkov, Alexandre V.; Zhu, Zihua; Ryan, Joseph V.","12 MANAGEMENT OF RADIOACTIVE AND NON-RADIOACTIVE WASTES FROM NUCLEAR FACILITIES; Glass; Corrosion; Nuclear waste glass; Natural glass; Atom-probe tomography; time-of-flight mass spectroscopy; Isotopic tracing","An understanding of the mechanisms responsible for controlling the long-term corrosion rate of nuclear waste glass is paramount if reliable glass dissolution models are to be used to calculate the controlled release of radionuclides from nuclear waste glass under geologic disposal conditions. Additionally, understanding silicate glass dissolution is also important for natural glasses to understand the role from the dissolution of these glasses has on the composition of natural aquatic systems. Two general mechanisms appear to be responsible for the elemental release from glass to the surrounding biosphere - ion exchange (release principally of alkalis) and matrix dissolution (release of the structural components of the glass). Key unknowns related to these mechanisms are the impact of surface layers on the altered glass and how these layers participate in corrosion. To better understand the impact of these layers on glass corrosion, we made two glasses of the same elemental composition, but with selected elements enriched in specific isotopes, e.g. more <sup>10</sup>B than <sup>11</sup>B. We reacted these glasses for 1 y then the solutions from each were exchanged and the chemistry of the solutions and the solids were followed for another 2 y and in some cases 3 y. This allowed us to follow changes in the glasses with respect to these elements and how these elements were transported through the alteration layers with time and, for at least one element, into the glass. Results from these experiments demonstrate that the release behavior of different elements is strongly dependent on their structural role in the glass (e.g. network formers and modifiers), but, more importantly, the role of water transport and subsequent ion exchange has in the long-term dissolution of the glass studied here. In this article, we highlight the behavior of four elements: lithium, sodium, silicon, and boron. Lithium and sodium, network modifying elements, have similar chemistries. The behavior of Li could be tracked in more detail by following both <sup>6</sup>Li and <sup>7</sup>Li; Li penetrates through the gel layer in both directions without hinderance and into and released from the glass deeper than sodium. Silicon, a network forming element, reacts with the silica-rich alteration layer. Boron, a network forming element, does not accumulate in the gel or the pristine glass and has a very sharp elemental profile between the pristine glass and alteration layer. Boron, lithium, and sodium elemental profiles suggest that there is little if any transport control within the alteration layer. The correlation between the Li and Na profiles and that of a water species suggest that the limiting release is a steady state between the diffusion of a water species and matrix dissolution that results in a low release rate for alkali and this provides a steady driving force for the long-term dissolution of glass.","Elsevier; The Geochemical Society; The Meteoritical Society","","Pacific Northwest National Lab.

A set of 22 waste compositions were selected to represent the range of wastes anticipated across the Hanford mission. Glass composition was formulated for each waste to simultaneously satisfy a full cadre of property and composition constraints while maximizing waste loading. Glass properties were estimated using property models recently developed for Hanford LAW Facility operation. The impacts from the property and composition constraints on the glass mass to be produced were calculated and compared. Electrical conductivity, Vapor Hydration Test and SO<sub>3</sub> melter tolerance, and canister-centerline cooling crystal constraints have a large effect on reducing total glass mass, while the impact from Product Consistency Test, viscosity, and isothermal crystal constraints is relatively small. Additionally, effects of model prediction and process/composition uncertainties were quantified.

"Vibrational spectroscopy analysis of silica and silicate glass networks","Liu, Hongshen; Kaya, Huseyin; Lin, Yen‐Ting; Ogrinc, Andrew; Kim, Seong H.","12 MANAGEMENT OF RADIOACTIVE AND NON-RADIOACTIVE WASTES FROM NUCLEAR FACILITIES","Vibrational spectroscopy has been widely used to investigate various structural aspects of the glass network, and there are a plethora of papers reporting subtle but consistent changes in infrared and Raman spectral features of glass upon alterations of glass compositions, thermal histories, mechanical stresses, or surface treatments. However, interpretations of such spectral features are still obscured due to the lack of well-established physical principles accurately describing vibrational modes of the non-crystalline glass network. Due to the non-equilibrium nature of the glass network, three-dimensionally connected without any long-range orders, vibrational spectral features of glass cannot be interpreted using the analogy with those of isolated molecular moieties or crystalline counterparts. Here, this feature article explains why such comparisons are outdated and describes the recent advances made from theoretical calculations of vibrational spectral features of amorphous networks or comparisons of computational results with experimental data. For the interpretation of vibrational spectral features of silica and silicate glasses, the following empirical relationships are suggested: (i) the intensity-weighted peak position of the Si-O-Si stretch mode negatively correlates with the weighted average of the Si-O bond length distribution, and (ii) the broad band of the Si-O-Si bending mode negatively correlates with the Si-O-Si bond angle distribution. Selected examples of vibrational spectroscopic imaging of surface defects are discussed to deliberate the implication of these findings in the structure-property relationship of silica and silicate glass materials. Unanswered questions and continuing research challenges are identified.","American Ceramic Society","","Pennsylvania State Univ., University Park, PA (United States)","USDOE Office of Science (SC), Basic Energy Sciences (BES); National Science Foundation (NSF)","","United States","2021-11-05T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: Journal of the American Ceramic Society; Journal Volume: 105; Journal Issue: 4","","Medium: ED; Size: p. 2355-2384","","","SC0016584","Journal ID: ISSN 0002-7820; DMR‐1609107; 2011410; TRN: US2305888","10.1111/jace.18206","","2023-04-10T00:00:00Z","1865531","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/1865531","https://www.osti.gov/servlets/purl/1865531","Journal of the American Ceramic Society","4","105"

Previous work attributed this to strengthening of the passive film by carbon. Here, however, we present a paradigm shift by showing that carbon actually weakens the passive film but strengthens the bonding within the alloy by forming localized (covalent) bonds with the metal atoms (Fe, Cr, Ni). Accordingly, the enhancement in pitting resistance is a result of carbon reducing the metal dissolution rate in a local pit environment by many orders of magnitude, which extremely decreases the growth stability of a pit and prevents it from transitioning into stable growth. Electronic structure calculations confirm that carbon bonds to the metal atoms and that the metal–carbon bonds are 1.4 to 2.0 times stronger than the metal–metal bonds. These results suggest a new strategy for the design of corrosion resistant alloys, namely surface engineering by infusion of concentrated interstitials that form strong bonds with the matrix atoms.","Elsevier","","The Ohio State Univ., Columbus, OH (United States); Energy Frontier Research Centers (EFRC) (United States).

Since corrosion occurs far below the glass-transition temperature, the alteration layer cannot fully relax to the new structure with the lowest possible energy. Molecular dynamics simulations suggested that such a network will contain highly strained chemical bonds, which can be manifested as a stress in the alteration layer. Common techniques to measure stress in thin films or surface layers were found inadequate for thick monolithic glass samples corroded in water. Here, we explored the use of spectroscopic ellipsometry to test the presence of internal stress in the alteration layer formed by aqueous corrosion of glass. Furthermore, a procedure for analyses of spectroscopic ellipsometry data to determine birefringence in the alteration layer was developed. Findings with the established fitting procedure suggested that a stress builds up in the corroded surface layer of a boroaluminosilicate glass if there is a change in relative humidity, pH, or electrolyte concentration of the environment to which the glass surface is exposed. A similar process may occur in other types of glass, and it may affect the surface properties of corroded glass objects.","American Chemical Society (ACS)","","Pennsylvania State Univ., University Park, PA (United States)","USDOE Office of Science (SC), Basic Energy Sciences (BES)","","United States","2021-10-13T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: ACS Applied Materials and Interfaces; Journal Volume: 13; Journal Issue: 42","","Medium: ED; Size: p. 50470-50480","","","SC0016584","Journal ID: ISSN 1944-8244; TRN: US2305885","10.1021/acsami.1c10134","","2023-04-10T00:00:00Z","1865520","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/1865520","https://www.osti.gov/servlets/purl/1865520","ACS Applied Materials and Interfaces","42","13"

These issues may be addressed with the utilization of a Cr corrosion barrier coating (CBC) but the interaction of Cr with SiC under loss of coolant accident (LOCA) conditions needs to be investigated. In the present work, Cr coatings were deposited onto chemically vapor deposited (CVD) SiC with either high power impulse magnetron sputtering (HiPIMS), cathodic arc (CA), or a combination of both. Annealing and steam thermogravimetric analysis (TGA) was used to study reaction product formation with and without oxidation. Additionally, after 1200 °C annealing, formation of a Cr<sub>x</sub>C<sub>y</sub> carbide layer at the ambient interface and a Cr<sub>x</sub>Si<sub>y</sub>C<sub>z</sub> silicide layer at the SiC interface was observed. After 1200 °C TGA exposure, similar carbide and silicide layers were observed but with a Cr<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub> outer reaction layer and a Si and O rich interfacial layer forming between the carbide and silicide layers. Initial mass gain of the coatings during the 1200 °C TGA exposure was parabolic and were similar to reported rates of chromia formation. Mass gain behavior and observed transitions in chromia microstructure indicate that metallic Cr may be consumed within the first ~1 h at 1200 °C and that subsequent chromia formation occurs at the expense of the underlying Cr carbide layer. Overall, the results show no detrimental impact of Cr coatings on the steam oxidation resistance of SiC up to 4 h at 1200 °C.","Elsevier","","Oak Ridge National Lab.

"An Alternative Conceptual Model for the Spent Nuclear Fuel–Water Interaction in Deep Geologic Disposal Conditions","Pastina, Barbara; LaVerne, Jay A.","12 MANAGEMENT OF RADIOACTIVE AND NON-RADIOACTIVE WASTES FROM NUCLEAR FACILITIES; spent nuclear fuel; long-term safety assessment; radioactive waste disposal; radiolysis; interfacial processes","For the long-term safety assessment of direct disposal of spent nuclear fuel in deep geologic repositories, knowledge on the radionuclide release rate from the UO<sub>2</sub> matrix is essential. This work provides a conceptual model to explain the results of leaching experiments involving used nuclear fuel or simulant materials in confirmed reducing conditions. Key elements of this model are: direct effect of radiation from radiolytic species (including defects and excited states) in the solid and in the first water layers in contact with its surface; and excess H<sub>2</sub> may be produced due to processes occurring at the surface of the spent fuel and in confined water volumes, which may also play a role in keeping the spent fuel surface in a reduced state. The implication is that the fractional radionuclide release rate used in most long-term safety assessments (10<sup>-7</sup> year<sup>-1</sup>) is over estimated because it assumes that there is net UO<sub>2</sub> oxidation caused by radiolysis, in contrast with the alternative conceptual model presented here.

"Machine learning-enabled prediction of chemical durability of A<sub>2</sub>B<sub>2</sub>O<sub>7</sub> pyrochlore and fluorite","Gong, Bowen; Yang, Kun; Lian, James A.; Wang, Jianwei","12 MANAGEMENT OF RADIOACTIVE AND NON-RADIOACTIVE WASTES FROM NUCLEAR FACILITIES","Pyrochlore-structure type and its derivative in a general formula A<sub>2</sub>B<sub>2</sub>O<sub>7</sub> (A = rare earth elements and actinides; B = Ti, Sn, Zr, Hf, Pb, Si, etc.) display excellent structural flexibility and rich crystal chemistry as promising nuclear waste form materials capable of immobilizing actinides and fission products. It is essential to understand these materials’ chemical durability and element release of radionuclides in order to evaluate their performance in near-field environment. However, it is a formidable grand technological challenge to experimentally perform durability testing across hundreds of thousands of possibilities resulting from their extreme compositional complexities due to cation substitutions at both A and B-sites. In this work, we demonstrate a machine learning approach to determine the key materials parameters and structural characteristics governing the leaching behaviors from a small set of selected compositions as model systems, enabling a science-based prediction of their chemical durability that can be extended to a wide range of chemical compositions. The combination of four key structural characteristics and materials parameters, including ionic radius size difference , ionic potential difference , electronegativity difference , and lattice parameter , creates features an optimized prediction of the chemical durability. Two machine learning models, linear regression and Kernel ridge regression models, are trained on the randomly-split training dataset derived from the experimentally-determined elemental release rates, and subsequently tested on the testing dataset. The predicted leaching rates from both machine learning models show an excellent agreement with the experimental data, demonstrating the feasibility of rapidly evaluating the material properties of new compositions. These results highlight the immense potential of synergizing informatics through machine learning-based models and well-controlled experiments of selected model systems to accelerate materials design and discovery with optimized compositions and performance of promising materials for effective nuclear waste management.","Elsevier","","Rensselaer Polytechnic Inst., Troy, NY (United States); Energy Frontier Research Centers (EFRC) (United States).

"Monitoring of helium gas leakage from canister storing spent nuclear fuel: Radiological consequences and management","Saegusa, Toshiari; Takeda, Hirofumi; Liu, Yung","12 MANAGEMENT OF RADIOACTIVE AND NON-RADIOACTIVE WASTES FROM NUCLEAR FACILITIES; Allowable leakage; Chloride-induced stress corrosion cracking; Helium gas leakage monitoring; Radiological consequence; Spent nuclear fuel storage","Chloride-induced stress corrosion cracking (CISCC) of canisters has been identified as a potential degradation mechanism requiring ageing management — especially in a marine air environment. Methods for monitoring helium gas leakage from canisters have been developed on the basis of a phenomenon that the bottom temperature of the canister increases as the top temperature of the canister decreases when helium gas leaks during storage. In this paper, we consider the radiological consequences of CISCC based on two scenarios of helium gas leakage and propose effective management that includes a timeline for monitoring and mitigation. Monitoring helium gas leakage by measuring the difference in temperature between canister surfaces in the dry cask storage of spent fuel (SF) can detect leakage before SF undergoes oxidation as a result of air ingress and before country-specific regulatory limits of off-site doses are exceeded, thereby enabling mitigatory action.","Elsevier","","Argonne National Lab.

"Reduced-order modeling of near-field THMC coupled processes for nuclear waste repositories in shale","Chang, Kyung Won; Nole, Michael; Stein, Emily R.","12 MANAGEMENT OF RADIOACTIVE AND NON-RADIOACTIVE WASTES FROM NUCLEAR FACILITIES; nuclear waste repository; THMC coupling; buffer swelling; shale; PFLOTRAN","Performance assessment (PA) of geologic radioactive waste repositories requires three-dimensional simulation of highly nonlinear, thermo-hydro-mechanical-chemical (THMC), multiphase flow and transport processes across many kilometers and over tens to hundreds of thousands of years. Integrating the effects of a near-field geomechanical process (i.e. buffer swelling) into coupled THC simulations through reduced-order modeling, rather than through fully coupled geomechanics, can reduce the dimensionality of the problem and improve computational efficiency. In this study, PFLOTRAN simulations model a single waste package in a shale host rock repository, where re-saturation of a bentonite buffer causes the buffer to swell and exert stress on a highly fractured disturbed rock zone (DRZ). Three types of stress-dependent permeability functions (exponential, modified cubic, and Two-part Hooke’s law models) are implemented to describe mechanical characteristics of the system. Overall, our modeling study suggests that compressing fractures reduces DRZ permeability, which could influence the rate of radionuclide transport and exchange with corrosive species in host rock groundwater that could accelerate waste package degradation. Less permeable shale host rock delays buffer swelling, consequently retarding DRZ permeability reduction as well as chemical transport within the barrier system.","Elsevier","","Sandia National Lab.

One advanced reactor fuel is tri-structural isotropic (TRISO) fuel particles which are approximately 0.9 mm in diameter. TRISO particle mobility, assuming the particle is unruptured and the encapsulated radionuclides are contained, was explored through a theoretical examination of mobility through atmospheric, soil and groundwater, surface water, and non-human biota transport pathways. TRISO particles are too large and dense to travel in the atmosphere except under extreme conditions. TRISO particles are too large to penetrate most soil profiles and so cannot be transported with groundwater. TRISO particles will settle out of the water column in surface waters but the transport will depend on the energy of the body of water and likelihood of extreme dispersion events. TRISO particles could be transported by non-human biota. The size of TRISO particles could allow them to be intentionally moved by non-human biota if they are ingested as a gastrolith or if they are mistaken for something in the organism’s diet. Generally, TRISO particles will have reduced environmental mobility compared to releases of radionuclides in the event of an accident in a conventional nuclear reactor. The extent of transport has implications in emergency planning zone designations and other considerations for licensing and deploying TRISO-fueled reactors. Finally, further research and experimental work exploring TRISO particle mobility is required to understand the full environmental mobility of TRISO particles.","Elsevier","","Pacific Northwest National Lab.

Uranium incorporation reduces hardness as compared with single component compositions. High entropy pyrochlore with uranium displays the highest thermal conductivity within multicomponent pyrochlore solid solutions with significantly better mechanical properties than UO<sub>2</sub>.

A benefit of using LANA75 is that the 3He generated from tritium decay is retained in the hydride material, allowing the hydride beds to deliver high-purity product gas. A disadvantage is that the 3He accumulates in the LANA75 material over time, which forms a heel that cannot be removed under normal operating conditions. The heel traps hydrogen in the bed, slowly reducing the operational capacity of the bed as the heel grows. Eventually, the <sup>3</sup>He begins to release from the material, preventing the delivery of high-purity product. The hydride beds are replaced when (1) operational capacity is reduced such that it is impactive to routine operations, and/or (2) product purity is not maintained due to <sup>3</sup>He release.Several beds were operated beyond their design life. One of these beds was selected to undergo heating beyond its normal operating temperature to evaluate the possibility of removing a portion of the hydrogen and helium heel to improve bed function until a replacement could take place. This bake-out removed a portion of the hydrogen and helium heel, and preliminary data indicate that bake-outs may partially regenerate the beds. The bed’s performance will continue to be monitored, and additional bake-outs will likely be performed. Performing bake-outs results in increasing the recovery of <sup>3</sup>He, more efficient end-of-life activities (such as isotopic exchange), and extension of the useful service life of the bed.","American Nuclear Society","available","Savannah River Site (SRS), Aiken, SC (United States)","USDOE","","United States","2021-03-31T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: Fusion Science and Technology; Journal Volume: 77; Journal Issue: 3","","Medium: ED; Size: p. 195-198","","SRNS-STI-2018-00621","AC09-08SR22470","Journal ID: ISSN 1536-1055; TRN: US2209681","10.1080/15361055.2020.1860418","","2022-09-21T00:00:00Z","1779697","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/1779697","https://www.osti.gov/servlets/purl/1779697","Fusion Science and Technology","3","77"

While there are uncertainties with under standing risk to individuals from exposure, the aim of this study was to focus on uncertainties and complexities for ecological systems, complicated by hundreds of species occupying any remediation site which participate in multiple-interacting food webs. The ability to better predict the effectiveness of remediation in fostering future ecosystems might facilitate remedy selection and improve strategic environmental management. This investigation examined (1) uncertainties in ecosystem processes, (2) uncertainties in exposure from contamination before remediation, and (3) uncertainties during remediation. Two Department of Energy sites Hanford Site and Savannah River Site were used as case studies to illustrate how the uncertainties affect eco-receptors. Several types of ecological, physical, and human dimension uncertainties are defined. Ecological uncertainties include temporal, spatial, individual, developmental, and exogenous types. Physical uncertainties are weather-related, watershed variations, slope/aspect, soil/sediment structure and form, unforeseen events, and temporal patterns. Human dimension uncertainties include current land use, future land use, extractive and non-extractive recreation. The effects of remedial strategies varied between the two sites because Hanford is a primarily arid shrub-steppe ecotype, while Savannah River is a wet forest ecotype. Defining the associated ecological sensitivities and uncertainties and providing examples might help policy-makers, managers, planners, and contractors to be aware of issues to consider throughout planning, remediation, and restoration. Adding ecological uncertainty analysis to risk evaluations and remediation planning is analogous to using safety factors in human health risk assessment.","Taylor & Francis","","Pacific Northwest National Lab.

A licensed CISF could be used to store tens of thousands of tonnes of spent nuclear fuel discharged from commercial power reactors using various cask and storage pad designs. A CISF design must comply with the regulatory requirements provided in 10 CFR Part 72, including requirements related to annual dose limits applicable to real individuals located beyond the area controlled by the licensee. Therefore, calculating a dose to the public is a necessary part of the licensing process for the construction of a CISF. These calculations are very challenging because of the complexity of the CISF design and the low magnitude of dose rate at large distances from the facility. This paper describes detailed far-field dose rate calculations performed for a proposed CISF using MAVRIC, the Monte Carlo radiation shielding sequence in SCALE 6.2.3, with automated variance reduction based on discrete ordinates calculations. The method presented in this paper uses a detailed Monte Carlo radiation transport simulation in one step from source to dose rate. A series of independent simulations was made using the complete site geometry (all casks present), but with only one cask containing radiation sources to obtain the dose rate maps produced by each storage cask. The CISF dose rate map was obtained by adding the dose rate maps produced by the independent individual cask simulations. Ample volumes of air and soil extending beyond the location of interest for dose rate calculation were included in the calculation model to properly simulate important radiation attenuation and scattering events that affect far-field dose rates. Furthermore, a comprehensive sensitivity study is included in this paper to illustrate the importance of selecting appropriate air volume, mass density, and composition for CISF skyshine dose rate calculations. Dry soil and soil containing water were analyzed to determine their effects on groundshine radiation.","Taylor & Francis - formerly American Nuclear Society (ANS)","","Oak Ridge National Lab.

Because bentonite is an integral component of many multibarrier repository systems, information on the hydraulic behavior of bentonite is crucial for modeling the long-term viability of such systems. In this paper the hydraulic behavior of bentonite samples was analyzed as a function of aggregate size, and samples were subjected to hydrothermal treatments involving contact with NaCl, KCl, and deionized water. Neutron and X-ray imaging were used to quantify water sorption into packed bentonite samples and bentonite swelling into the water column. The distance between the original clay-water interface and the wetting front was determined as a function of time. Average water uptake exhibited a square-root-of-time dependence in freshly prepared samples, but more variable rates were observed for samples previously in contact with water. The radiography was supported by small-angle neutron scattering analysis and ultra-small-angle neutron scattering analysis of aggregate size distributions and by inelastic neutron scattering to understand the physicochemical environment of the sorbed water. Results showed that hydrothermal treatment with KCl had the greatest effect of increased water transport in the bentonite, possibly as a result of the interaction of K<sup>+</sup> with smectite layers in the clay.","Taylor & Francis - formerly American Nuclear Society (ANS)","","Oak Ridge National Lab.

We utilize a one-way Chemo-Mechanical (C-M) coupling approach, in which chemical changes affect the mechanical behavior of bentonite through the BExM linked with the evolution of mass fraction of smectite, exchangeable cation concentration, and ionic strength via osmotic suction. The parameters of the new coupled model for FEBEX bentonite are calibrated against a series of laboratory experiments with various salinity solutions.

The gas phase fraction, temperature, and velocity distributions below the cold cap are used to calculate local and average heat transfer rates as a function of the bubbling rate. It is shown that the thickness of the cavities is nearly independent of the cold cap shape and the amount of foam evolved during batch conversion. Furthermore, it is ~7 mm and up to ~15 mm for the cases without and with forced bubbling used to promote circulation within the melt, respectively. Using computed velocity and temperature profiles, the melting rate of the simulated high-level nuclear waste glass batch was estimated to increase with the bubbling rate to the power of ~0.3 to 0.9, depending on the flow pattern. The simulation results are in good agreement with experimental data from laboratory- and pilot-scale melter tests.","American Ceramic Society","","Idaho National Lab.

Specifically, the amount of spent nuclear fuel (SNF) available to load into STADs with varying deployment dates is explored, and the scenarios are compared with a scenario in which STADs are never loaded at reactor sites. Two key findings are that about half of the U.S. inventory of commercial SNF could be captured in STADs if they were fully deployed by 2035 and that the percentage of SNF available to load into STADs decreases as STAD deployment is delayed.In additional scenarios, the effects of shipping STADs directly from at-reactor spent fuel pools (SFPs) to a CISF are analyzed for a STAD full deployment year of 2035. A key finding from the analysis is that the dry storage of SNF in STADs at reactor sites can be minimized by direct shipment to a CISF from reactor site SFPs. Furthermore, minimizing dry storage at reactor sites means maximizing the receipt rate for STADs at a CISF, and there is likely a more optimal point between the two scenarios for an overall cost-effective operation of waste management systems.","Taylor & Francis - formerly American Nuclear Society (ANS)","","Oak Ridge National Lab.

Accordingly, a series of 3- to 6-component borosilicate glasses have been designed starting from Na<sub>2</sub>O–B<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub>–SiO<sub>2</sub> ternary, wherein the compositional complexity has been added in a systematic tiered approach, finally resulting in the composition of the well-known international simple glass (ISG). Tetramethylammonium hydroxide (TMAH), one of the most widely used alkaline etchant in the glass and electronics industry, has been used as the corrosion media. A series of state-of-the-art characterization techniques including magic angle spinning nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy, X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy, inductively coupled plasma optical emission spectroscopy, elastic recoil detection analysis, and high-resolution transmission electron microscopy have been employed to unearth the compositional dependence of glass corrosion in hyper-alkaline environments. The glass compositions underwent congruent corrosion in the forward rate regime, whereas the controlling mechanism of corrosion in the residual rate regime depends on the presence/absence of Ca in the surrounding environment and can be explained on the basis of the dissolution–reprecipitation model. The dependence of corrosion kinetics and the chemistry of alteration products (in the residual rate regime) on the glass composition have been discussed. Here, the results presented in this contribution will ultimately supplement the scientific literature attempting to understand the fundamental science governing the aqueous corrosion of silicate-based glass chemistries and add to the growing database required to develop non-empirical predictive models for designing glasses with controlled dissolution rates.","American Chemical Society","","Rutgers Univ., New Brunswick, NJ (United States)","USDOE Office of Environmental Management (EM); USDOE Office of Nuclear Energy (NE), Nuclear Energy University Program (NEUP)","","United States","2020-12-04T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: Journal of Physical Chemistry.

The fault activation experiments were conducted in situ by water injection at variable pressure from boreholes targeting different parts of the Main Fault crossing several tunnels and galleries of the Mont Terri Laboratory. The model simulations focused on (1) an experiment activating a discontinuity (fracture or minor fault) within the damage zone of the main fault, and (2) an experiment activating discontinuities close to the core of the Main Fault. The experimental data consist of coupled hydraulic and mechanical responses monitored at an injection borehole and a monitoring borehole located a few meters away. After overcoming several modeling issues along with necessary model developments, a reasonably good agreement was achieved between the modeling results and the field observations. The fault activation experiments displayed an abrupt flow rate increase associated with a sudden fracture opening and rupture propagation after the injection pressure reached above the estimated normal stress on the fracture. This was followed by an abrupt flow rate decrease, indicating hydraulic closing, once the injection pressure decreases to an estimated 1–2 MPa below the stress normal to the opened fracture. The models were able to capture this abrupt hydromechanical behavior, including an observed dominant opening behavior along with the rupture propagation, while the spatial extent of the shear rupture and the quantity of peak injection flow were the most challenging to predict.","Elsevier","","Lawrence Berkeley National Lab.

"Patchy particle model of hydrated amorphous silica","Kerisit, Sebastien; Mahadevan, Thiruvillamalai; Du, Jincheng","12 MANAGEMENT OF RADIOACTIVE AND NON-RADIOACTIVE WASTES FROM NUCLEAR FACILITIES; Glass corrosion; interfacial structure; atomistic simulations; Monte Carlo simulations","Glasses corroded in static aqueous conditions typically reach a slow, residual rate of dissolution as a result of the complex interplay between multiple processes. While intrinsically suited to address this problem, Monte Carlo (MC) models developed to date have relied on lattices to describe the amorphous structure of glass and are thus unable to reproduce the residual rate of glass corrosion. A recently developed MC approach based on amorphous structures derived from molecular dynamics simulations offers a solution [Kerisit and Du J. Non-Cryst. Solids 522 (2019) 119601], but it requires a simple model that can rapidly relax the glass-water interface upon each dissolution/condensation event to retain the ability of MC simulations to reach large spatial and temporal scales. To this end, a patchy particle model of hydrated amorphous silica was developed and evaluated against atomistic simulations in this work. Models of water and amorphous silica were first developed separately, and cross terms were then defined to enable simulations of hydrated amorphous silica structures with varying water content. While the nature of its interaction potential prevents the patchy particle model from reproducing simultaneously the structure and dynamics of the systems of interest with a single set of parameters, it described well the connectivity of hydrated amorphous silica structures and the local coordination geometry of individual species. Therefore, this model opens the door to MC simulations of the residual rate of glass corrosion and offers an alternative to atomistic models to investigate the evolution of silica gels over large spatial and temporal scales.","Elsevier","","Univ. of North Texas, Denton, TX (United States); Pacific Northwest National Lab.

Radioisotopes of each element, along with the conservative tracer tritium, were injected in the presence and absence of montmorillonite colloids into a naturally fractured chalk core. In parallel, batch experiments were conducted to obtain experimental sorption coefficients (K<sub>d</sub>, mL/g) for both montmorillonite colloids and the chalk fracture material. Breakthrough curves were modelled to determine diffusivity and sorption of each radionuclide to the chalk and the colloids under advective conditions. Uranium sorbed sparingly to chalk (log K<sub>d</sub> = 0.7 ± 0.2) in batch sorption experiments. <sup>233</sup>U(VI) breakthrough was controlled primarily by the matrix diffusion and sorption to chalk (15 and 25% recovery with and without colloids, respectively). Cesium, in contrast, sorbed strongly to both the montmorillonite colloids and chalk (batch log K<sub>d</sub> = 3.2 ± 0.01 and 3.9 ± 0.01, respectively). The high affinity to chalk and low colloid concentrations overwhelmed any colloidal Cs transport, resulting in very low <sup>137</sup>Cs breakthrough (1.1–5.5% mass recovery). Batch and fracture transport results, and the associated modelling revealed that Pu migrates both as Pu (IV) sorbed to montmorillonite colloids and as dissolved Pu(V) (7% recovery). Transport experiments revealed differences in Pu(IV) and Pu(V) transport behavior that could not be quantified in simple batch experiments but are critical to effectively predict transport behavior of redox-sensitive radionuclides. Finally, a brackish groundwater solution was injected after completion of the fracture flow experiments and resulted in remobilization and recovery of 2.2% of the total sorbed radionuclides which remained in the core from previous experiments. In general, our study demonstrates consistency in sorption behavior between batch and advective fracture transport. Finally, the results suggest that colloid-facilitated radionuclide transport will enhance radionuclide migration in fractured chalk for those radionuclides with exceedingly high affinity for colloids.","Elsevier","External Audience (Unlimited)","Lawrence Livermore National Lab.

However, the nature of such water flow remains elusive. In this work, we report our molecular-modeling results on water flow in a sub-nanometer clay interlayer between two montmorillonite layers. We show that a fast advective flow can be induced by evaporation at one end of the interlayer channel, that is, a large suction pressure created by evaporation (~818 MPa) is able to drive the fast water flow through the channel (~0.88 m/s for a 46 Å-long channel). Scaled up for the pressure gradient to a 2 μm particle, the velocity of water is estimated to be about 95 μm/s, indicating that water can quickly flow through a μm-sized clay particle within seconds. The prediction seems to be confirmed by our thermogravimetric analysis of bentonite hydration and dehydration processes, which indicates that water transport at the early stage of the dehydration is a fast advective process, followed by a slow diffusion process. The possible occurrence of a fast advective water flow in clay interlayers prompts us to reassess water transport in a broad set of natural and engineered systems such as clay swelling/shrinking, moisture transport in soils, water uptake by plants, water imbibition/release in unconventional hydrocarbon reservoirs, and cap rock integrity of supercritical CO<sub>2</sub> storage.","American Chemical Society (ACS)","","Sandia National Lab.

The behavior of host rock is highly coupled thermally, hydromechanically, and chemically.

A coupled thermo-hydromechanical (THM) simulation is carried out using TOUGH-FLAC simulator to model THM behaviors of a generic nuclear waste repository, in order to evaluate the performance of the developed methodology, which is implemented in a coupled TH simulation. Results show that stress and permeability change estimated by the developed methodology in the TH-coupled simulation match those calculated in the THM-coupled simulation over the simulated timeframe of over 10,000 years. Details about errors in stress and permeability estimates accrued by the developed methodology are discussed here.

"Improving Long-term Monitoring of Contaminated Groundwater at Sites where Attenuation-based Remedies are Deployed","Denham, Miles E.; Amidon, Mark B.; Wainwright, Haruko M.; Dafflon, Baptiste; Ajo-Franklin, Jonathan; Eddy-Dilek, Carol A.","12 MANAGEMENT OF RADIOACTIVE AND NON-RADIOACTIVE WASTES FROM NUCLEAR FACILITIES; Groundwater; long-term monitoring; radionuclide contamination; remediation","This study presents an effective approach to tackle the challenge of long-term monitoring of contaminated groundwater sites where remediation leaves residual contamination in the subsurface. Traditional long-term monitoring of contaminated groundwater sites focuses on measuring contaminant concentrations and is applicable to sites where contaminant mass is removed or degraded to a level below the regulatory standard. The traditional approach is less effective at sites where risk from metals or radionuclides continues to exist in the subsurface after remedial goals are achieved. We propose a long-term monitoring strategy for this type of waste site that focuses on measuring the hydrological and geochemical parameters that control attenuation or remobilization of contaminants while de-emphasizing contaminant-concentration measurements. Furthermore, we demonstrate how this approach would be more effective than traditional long-term monitoring, using a site in South Carolina, USA, where groundwater is contaminated by several radionuclides. A comprehensive enhanced attenuation remedy has been implemented at the site to minimize discharge of contamination to surface water. The immobilization of contaminants occurs in three locations by manipulation of hydrological and geochemical parameters, as well as by natural attenuation processes. Deployment of our proposed long-term monitoring strategy will combine subsurface and surface measurements using spectroscopic tools, geophysical tools, and sensors to monitor the parameters controlling contaminant attenuation. The advantage of this approach is that it will detect the potential for contaminant remobilization from engineered and natural attenuation zones, allowing potential adverse changes to be mitigated before contaminant attenuation is reversed.","Springer","available","Savannah River Site (SRS), Aiken, SC (United States).

"Network structure in alteration layer of boroaluminosilicate glass formed by aqueous corrosion","Kaya, Huseyin; Ngo, Dien; Smith, Nicholas J.; Gin, Stéphane; Kim, Seong H.","12 MANAGEMENT OF RADIOACTIVE AND NON-RADIOACTIVE WASTES FROM NUCLEAR FACILITIES; Glass; IR spectroscopy; Ellipsometry; Porous; Thin film; Corrosion","Exogenously-added LiCl has been shown to slightly accelerate the corrosion rate of a boroaluminosilicate glass called International Simple Glass (ISG) in aqueous solutions over forward- and residual-rate regimes, while KCl and CsCl impede. To understand the effect of exogenously added electrolytes on resulting hydrous species and the network structure of alteration layers, infrared spectroscopy was implemented. It was found that the fraction of molecular water relative to the surface-bound hydroxyl species is lower in the KCl and CsCl conditions compared to the LiCl and pure water conditions. An approximation for the spectral features of the thin surface films from an experimentally-obtained specular-reflectance infrared (SR-IR) spectrum was proposed; results indicate no significant difference in the Si-O bonding network of the alteration layers formed in the presence of exogenously added LiCl, KCl and CsCl. Furthermore, the observed change in corrosion rates might be linked to the relative abundance of molecular water species in the porous network, rather than the silicate bonding structure.","Elsevier","","Pennsylvania State Univ., University Park, PA (United States)","USDOE Office of Science (SC), Basic Energy Sciences (BES)","","United States","2020-10-21T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: Journal of Non-Crystalline Solids; Journal Volume: 553","","Medium: ED; Size: Article No. 120494","","","SC0016584","Journal ID: ISSN 0022-3093; TRN: US2305886","10.1016/j.jnoncrysol.2020.120494","","2023-04-10T00:00:00Z","1865522","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/1865522","https://www.osti.gov/servlets/purl/1865522","Journal of Non-Crystalline Solids","","553"

A remote (100 ft away from the simulated radiative environment) demonstration of the VRM was successfully performed on a full-scale mock-up welded stainless steel canister. The VRM is designed with features to accommodate remediation techniques beyond those currently selected and described in this paper. Therefore, many of the VRM’s features may benefit other remote nuclear or nonnuclear applications.

In strongly alkaline solutions typifying Hanford tank waste, Tc exists as pertechnetate (TcO<sub>4</sub><sup>-</sup>) (oxidation state VII) as well as in reduced forms (oxidation state < VII), collectively known as non- pertechnetate (non-TcO<sub>4</sub><sup>-</sup>) species. Designing strategies for effective Tc management, including separation and immobilization, necessitates understanding the molecular structure of the non-TcO<sub>4</sub><sup>-</sup> species and their identification in actual tank waste samples. Identification of non-TcO<sub>4</sub><sup>-</sup> species would facilitate the development of new treatment technologies effective for dissimilar Tc species. Toward this objective, a spectroscopic library of the Tc(I) [fac-Tc(CO<sub>3</sub>)]<sup>+</sup> and Tc(II, IV, V, VII) compounds was generated and applied to the characterization of the actual Hanford AN-102 tank waste supernatant, which was processed to adjust Na concentration to similar to 5.6 M and remove <sup>137</sup>Cs by spherical resorcinol-formaldehyde (sRF) ion-exchange resin.

Pressure washing the porous building materials under spray conditions typical with do-it-yourself units improved decontamination factors (DFs) for <sup>152</sup>Eu compared to low-pressure application of tap water (majority of two-tailed t-test p-values &lt; 0.1), but pressure did not improve DFs for <sup>137</sup>Cs or <sup>85</sup>Sr. For both pressurized and low-pressure applications, adding potassium ions (K<span class=""math""><math><msup is=""true""><mrow is=""true""></mrow><mrow is=""true""><mo is=""true"">+</mo></mrow></msup></math></span>) to promote ion exchange reactions produced significantly higher DFs for tested radionuclides on asphalt, brick, and concrete. The resultant contaminated wash water can be processed through self-prepared chemical filtration beds of clay and sand. Modeled in a prior study, the beds yielded linear trends (R<sup>2</sup> &gt; 0.98) in sensitivity analyses between most bed configuration variables and bed performance variables, permitting flexible ad-hoc bed design. The experimental and simulation results led to estimates of the remediation rate and waste generated after cleaning 250 m<sup>2</sup> of cesium-contaminated concrete from the combined deployment of a power washer and two different mobile treatment beds. Furthermore, the first treatment bed was designed to reduce treatment time and processed 1900 L of wash solution in 70 min using 880 kg of clay/sand infill material. Designed to reduce the solid waste generated, the second bed processed the same solution volume in 1040 min (17 h) using 170 kg of clay/sand infill material. The results of this analysis warrant further investigation of power washing with recycled salt solution as an effective rapid decontamination method with manageable waste.","Elsevier","","Argonne National Lab.

Salts (such as nitrates, sulfates, carbonates, halides, etc.) play a key role in these low temperature reactions as they sequentially melt, decompose, and volatilize during batch-to-glass conversion. To further understand these complex processes, simplified LAW melts containing oxyanion salts (sodium salts of carbonate, sulfate, and/or nitrate) and early melting glass formers (boric acid) have been evaluated using thermal analysis, infrared absorption spectroscopy, and X-ray diffraction. Results from this study indicate that the volatilization behavior of particular salts is influenced by the presence or absence of other salts. Here, NaNO<sub>3</sub> volatilization is decreased by the presence of Na<sub>2</sub>SO<sub>4</sub>. The addition of either Na<sub>2</sub>SO<sub>4</sub> or NaNO<sub>3</sub> to the system may enhance the volatilization of Na<sub>2</sub>CO<sub>3</sub>.

"Thermal management associated with geologic disposal of large spent nuclear fuel canisters in tunnels with thermally engineered backfill","Rutqvist, Jonny","12 MANAGEMENT OF RADIOACTIVE AND NON-RADIOACTIVE WASTES FROM NUCLEAR FACILITIES; Nuclear waste disposal; Coupled processes modeling; Thermal management; Rock stress","Coupled thermal-hydro-mechanical (THM) numerical modeling is conducted to study thermal management associated with geologic disposal of spent nuclear fuel (SNF) in large dual-purpose canisters (DPCs). DPCs, are containers designed for SNF storage and transportation and if determined to be feasible for permanent geological disposal could provide a cost effective disposal solution. However, one of the challenges to direct disposal of DPCs is thermal management to avoid overheating of the Engineered Barrier System (EBS), including bentonite-backfill used as a protective buffer. The model simulations show that the use of a backfill that is thermally engineered for high heat conduction can reduce the EBS temperature to acceptable levels for disposal of large waste canisters in backfilled tunnels. On the other hand, the use of high heat conduction backfill will not reduce the far field rock peak temperature that can occur several thousand years after closure of the repository. This longer term host rock peak temperature generates thermal-poro-elastic stress and geomechanical changes that must be considered in the thermal management and design of a repository.","Elsevier","","Lawrence Berkeley National Lab.

Here, we use density functional theory (DFT) calculations to investigate the electronic structures of Zr-, Th-, and U-MOFs, including their electronic band structures and, where appropriate, their magnetic properties. We employ various DFT methods including DFT + U, collinear spin-polarization, spin–orbit coupling, and various flavors of exchange–correlation functionals to assess the robustness to the specific exchange–correlation functional.

Laboratory scale testing of the ion exchange process has been conducted by Pacific Northwest National Laboratory to evaluate Cs removal with CST in supernates collected from Hanford tanks 241-AP-107 and 241-AW-102 under prototypic plant operating conditions. In an effort to understand the selectivity and partitioning of other analytes toward CST, specifically Resource Conservation and Recovery Act (RCRA) hazardous metals, selected +2 cations, and transuranic elements, a method for the complete dissolution of CST and Cs removal from the digestate was applied to the spent CST post-processing Hanford tank waste.

At the Hanford Site in Southeastern Washington State, iodate (IO<sub>3</sub><sup>-</sup>) is the main aqueous species in dilute radioiodine groundwater plumes. Like other oxyanions, IO<sub>3</sub><sup>-</sup> may be incorporated into and/or adsorbed onto calcite, a common mineral at Hanford, decreasing its mobility in the environment. A series of macroscale batch experiments combined with solid phase characterization were conducted to identify variables impacting time-dependent aqueous IO<sub>3</sub><sup>-</sup> removal via calcite precipitation and determine the location of IO<sub>3</sub><sup>-</sup> within the calcite crystal structure. Results demonstrated 11.5-97% aqueous IO<sub>3</sub><sup>-</sup> removal during initial rapid calcite precipitation. Incorporation was apparently the main removal mechanism, although later slower precipitation and/or adsorption may have also contributed to IO<sub>3</sub><sup>-</sup> removal. Using a higher concentration of the calcite forming solutions (i.e., using 1M vs. 0.1M concentrations) resulted in an increase in the amount of precipitated calcite and a greater percentage of IO<sub>3</sub><sup>-</sup> removed; however, calcite formed with lower molarity solutions resulted in higher IO<sub>3</sub><sup>-</sup> mass (µg/g) removal. Solubility testing of laboratory produced calcites showed only small differences in solubility for calcite with and without IO<sub>3</sub><sup>-</sup> incorporated into the structure. Evidence collected from SEM/FIB and TEM/SAED suggested that the IO<sub>3</sub><sup>-</sup> incorporated into calcite was present in regions close to surface (implying potential easy release upon calcite dissolution).","Springer-Verlag","","Pacific Northwest National Lab.

"Monte Carlo characterization of the cosmic ray muon flux in shallow subsurface geological repositories intended for disposal of radioactive materials","Gadey, Harish; Chatzidakis, Stylianos; Farsoni, Abi T.","12 MANAGEMENT OF RADIOACTIVE AND NON-RADIOACTIVE WASTES FROM NUCLEAR FACILITIES; Cosmic ray muons; Geological repository; Monitoring; Safeguards","Recent challenges in monitoring subsurface geological repositories intended for disposal of radioactive materials such as spent nuclear fuel call for new, innovative concepts that are facility independent, cost-effective, passive, and reliable. Once nuclear material is in place at these facilities, reverifying the inventory may no longer be feasible if continuity of knowledge is lost or unavailable to the inspectors. Using cosmic ray muons may present several potential advantages over conventional photon/neutron signatures, and their use in safeguards applications have only received attention in the past decade. However, there have been limited efforts to explore the integration of cosmic ray muons into repository safeguards and study potential gains, risks, and costs. This paper presents a Monte Carlo-based methodology to characterize the cosmic ray muon flux, including muon angular and energy differential distributions at depths representative of subsurface geological repositories. Since there have been limited measurements at these sites and a measurement made in one site is not always transferable to another site, the objective is to develop an efficient simulation method and useful parametrizations to provide a convenient tool for enabling muon simulations at any geological repository site. It is expected these results will provide a better understanding of how muons can be integrated into an existing geological repository safeguards framework.","Elsevier","","Oak Ridge National Lab.

Np(V)-bearing aqueous solutions were contacted with polished and crushed gneiss and dolerite from the Yeniseisky site, Russia, which is under consideration as a location for an underground repository, both in oxic and anoxic conditions at 20 and 90 °C. Neptunium sorption on crushed gneiss and dolerite in oxic conditions at 20 °C was quite low, but increased substantially in anoxic conditions. Autoradiography on samples treated at 20 °C revealed that sorbed Np was associated mostly with dark colored iron-bearing minerals, and solvent extraction indicated partial reduction of Np(V) to Np(IV). Sorption of Np from aqueous solutions contacted with dolerite and gneiss at 90 °C was in all cases higher than at the lower temperature. Autoradiography of polished rock samples treated in anoxic conditions at 90 °C revealed that Fe-bearing minerals had 3–4 orders of magnitude more Np sorbed on them than the quartz and feldspar grains. X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy indicated this sorbed Np was present as NpO<sub>2</sub>.

This paper reviews technologies studied for radiological contaminants. In addition to nuclear facility decommissioning, nuclear power plant accidents at Chernobyl (Former Soviet Union), Fukushima (Japan) and elsewhere have provided real world situations to both develop and test technologies to remediate radiological contamination and to return roadways, along with adjacent vegetation and soil, to prior use. From publications arising from these efforts, technologies were reviewed for radioactive material with two distinct properties (water-soluble and insoluble radioactive contaminants). The reported characteristics and capabilities of technologies are summarized in this review. This review also presents logistical considerations of implementation of the technologies, including waste management which can be an extreme impediment to rapid remediation if generated quantities of hazardous waste exceed local handling capacity. The summarized literature review suggests future avenues of work, chiefly for insoluble particulates, focused on technologies which may be mechanistically applicable to their remediation. While the underlying chemical and physical mechanisms that contribute to transport differ among contaminants, the studies reviewed here might also be applicable to non-radioactive contaminants, because the presence of radioactivity is largely independent of the underlying mechanisms.","Elsevier","","Lawrence Livermore National Lab.

We sought to develop a parsimonious algorithm based on the additivity of partial molar volumes of individual oxide components weighted by their mole fraction in a glass composition. Bound molar volumes were used for oxides in which the density of the oxide bound in a glass matrix was previously determined. The bound molar volumes were known for oxides covering 97.5 mole percent of the database compositional space. The measured glass densities were plotted against the estimated glass densities and a linear regression yielded an R<sup>2</sup><sub>adj.</sub> = 0.95 and a slope and intercept of approximately one and zero, respectively. This regression suggests that glass densities estimated by the algorithm, within analysis uncertainty, are equal to the measured densities of the glasses. In addition to the development of the density estimation, we corroborated many of the referenced bound molar volume data used in the parameterization of the estimation algorithm via linear regression of the individual partial molar volumes versus the inverse measured densities (specific volumes) of the glasses in the database.","American Ceramic Society","available","Savannah River Site (SRS), Aiken, SC (United States).

In this work, pore volumes and solid structures of glass alteration layers formed in solutions of various pH conditions are evaluated with positron annihilation spectroscopy and small angle X-ray scattering. Pore volumes of alteration layers formed at pH 9 were found to be at their lowest near the surfaces of the alteration layers. Solid structures of alteration layers are compared to those of synthetic aerogels of comparable compositions produced under various pH conditions. Alteration layers formed at pH 11 were shown to contain large structures (>10 nm) similar to synthetic aerogels created under neutral and basic conditions whereas alteration layers formed at pH 9 did not. The large structures formed at pH 11 are proposed to be caused by excessive free Si species through Ostwald Ripening.","Springer","","Pacific Northwest National Lab.

We performed pore-scale reactive transport simulations of the UO<sub>2</sub> corrosion process in a defective fuel rod with different orientations of breach or fracture on its clad. It is found that the corrosion rate has strong dependency on the breach orientation. The highest corrosion rate of UO<sub>2</sub> is calculated when the angle between the groundwater flow direction and the clad fracture reaches 180°. UO<sub>2</sub> corrosion simulations with different flow rates are compared. The results show the higher flow rate accelerates the corrosion of UO<sub>2</sub> fuel. The effect of pH on the corrosion process is also determined. It is indicated that higher pH can limit the corrosion of UO<sub>2</sub> by reducing the reaction rate. The dependence of reaction rate and time on reactive surface area is explored. Spent fuel with lower surface area demonstrates longer lifetime under corrosion conditions. A numerical model coupling thermal conduction and chemical reactions is developed to assess the impact of temperature on the process of UO<sub>2</sub> corrosion. The results show that higher temperature leads to larger corrosion rates for UO<sub>2</sub>. Here, the predicted reaction rates are higher in comparison with the isothermal results. Hence, our results can help improve the fundamental understanding of UO<sub>2</sub> corrosion in geological repositories for long-term storage of spent nuclear fuels and provide guidance for the safe operations and selection of appropriate repositories.","Elsevier","","Los Alamos National Lab.

This study presents a validation of the integrated CFD model by using data from two experimental runs in a pilot-scale melter. While the model uses several simplifying assumptions (such as constant heat sinks from a cooling jacket and inleakage of ambient air, steady state feed-to-batch conversion heat, and a cold cap model with a simplified shape), it closely predicts the molten glass (1150°C and 1175°C) and plenum temperatures (550°C) obtained from thermocouples during two pilot-scale tests, with an average cold cap coverage of 80%. Additional simulations were performed to explore the sensitivity of the predicted plenum temperatures to variations in cold cap coverage (fraction of melt surface covered by the glass batch) and batch emissivity. The plenum temperature was found to be in the range of 606°C when cold cap coverage decreased from 95% to 70%. Cold cap emissivity had a smaller effect, increasing the plenum temperature by as much as 179°C when cold cap emissivity increased from 0.2 to 0.8. Maintaining a high cold cap coverage without overfeeding is important for a sustained melter operation with high glass throughput. This work provides a tool for achieving that goal in terms of correlating the plenum temperature with the cold cap coverage.","American Ceramic Society","","Idaho National Lab.

In particular, the ability to predict the permeability and mechanics of these media remains a persistent fundamental challenge in the geosciences. In the present work, we show how large-scale classical molecular dynamics (MD) simulations can help interpret the properties of fine-grained sedimentary material. All-atom simulations containing 30 discrete clay particles are utilized to understand the evolution of a clay nanoparticle suspension during its progressive dehydration. Microstructural (pore size distribution, tortuosity, anisotropy), thermodynamic (enthalpy and free energy of hydration, anion exclusion), mechanical (total suction), and transport properties (diffusion coefficient tensors of water and sodium) are calculated and compared to the experiment. Overall, our results provide new insight into the coupled chemistry, mechanics, and transport properties of disordered nanoparticle assemblages and shed light upon the important role of water films in controlling these properties.","American Chemical Society","","Princeton Univ., NJ (United States)","USDOE Office of Science (SC), Basic Energy Sciences (BES).

Matthew; Yu, Xiao-Ying; Suffield, Sarah R.; Recknagle, Kurtis P.","12 MANAGEMENT OF RADIOACTIVE AND NON-RADIOACTIVE WASTES FROM NUCLEAR FACILITIES; CFD; standards; modeling; radioactive air","Proposed construction of or changes to a radiological effluent stack must meet the mixing criteria at the sampled stack location required by the standard ANSI/HPS N13.1-2011 and ISO 2889. Meeting the mixing criteria may be a requirement for operations under a permit. For a well-mixed sample location, the standard requires less than 20° flow angle variation and less than 20% variation of the air velocity, gas tracers, and particle tracers measured at the center two-thirds of the sampling point cross-section. An additional criteria for gases is that at no point in the sampling plane does the concentration vary from the mean by greater than 30%. For more than a decade, three-dimensional computational fluid dynamics (CFD) models of such stacks have been used to assist in characterizing the sample location suitability. Results of modeling have shown stacks designs where mixing is both adequate and inadequate. For situations in which inadequate mixing in the stack at the sampling location has been identified, additional modeling with design modifications (e.g., adding an air blender) was used to asses if mixing criteria improved. Testing results have confirmed the CFD model blind predictions with similar values (i.e., ± 5% coefficient of variance) for the mixing criteria in both scale model and full-scale stack tests. CFD simulations of flow and mixing within a stack scheduled for modifications can indicate if the retrofitted stack passes mixing criteria for baseline operating conditions, can evaluate stack mixing performance at the limits of operation, and can recommend modifications if needed. This work demonstrates that CFD modeling is an effective tool for designing a new or retrofitting a facility stack and should be considered for use to help qualify a stack sampling location to meet standard requirements.","Elsevier","","Pacific Northwest National Lab.

"Kinetics of Co-Mingled <sup>99</sup>Tc and Cr Removal during Mineral Transformation of Ferrous Hydroxide","Saslow, Sarah A.; Pearce, Carolyn I.; Bowden, Mark E.; Lukens, Wayne W.; Kim, Dong-Sang; Kruger, Albert A.; Um, Wooyong","37 INORGANIC, ORGANIC, PHYSICAL, AND ANALYTICAL CHEMISTRY; 12 MANAGEMENT OF RADIOACTIVE AND NON-RADIOACTIVE WASTES FROM NUCLEAR FACILITIES; nuclear waste; technetium; reduction; mineral incorporation; kinetics; immobilization","In this work, four simulated waste streams relevant to the vitrification of Hanford nuclear waste were studied to evaluate the removal kinetics of technetium-99 (Tc) and co-mingled Cr(VI) during treatment with solid ferrous hydroxide (Fe(OH)<sub>2</sub>(s)). Simulants treated with Fe(OH)<sub>2</sub>(s) were reacted for 24 h and sub-sampled periodically to monitor Tc and Cr removal. Solution sample analysis during the reaction was coupled with solid phase characterization, for example, X-ray absorption spectroscopy (XAS) and X-ray diffraction (XRD), to establish influence of the solid phase product on Tc and Cr removal rates. Based on these results, the majority of Tc and Cr removal occurs within the first 5 min of simulant contact with Fe(OH)<sub>2</sub>(s). However, the order in which Tc and Cr are completely removed from each simulant depends on the simulant chemistry, the preferred reduction pathway, and the solid phase product, for example, magnetite (Fe<sub>3</sub>O<sub>4</sub>) versus goethite (α-FeOOH). Low pH and low Cr concentrations favor rapid Tc removal, with XRD and XAS confirming that Fe<sub>3</sub>O<sub>4</sub> readily incorporates reduced Tc(IV) into its structure. High pH, high Cr concentrations, and the presence of other co-mingled constituents favor heterogeneous removal of Tc early in the reaction (&lt;1 h) with removal rates often faster than those determined for Cr. At reaction times of &gt;1 h, Tc removal slows as homogeneous removal of Cr begins to dominate, concurrent with an increase in the formation of FeOOH as the solid phase reaction product. These results suggest that for complex, high pH waste streams, Tc removal within the first hour after Fe(OH)<sub>2</sub>(s) treatment is necessary for complete Tc reduction and improved mineral immobilization.","American Chemical Society","","Pacific Northwest National Lab.

J.; Anderson, Brian E.; Shayer, Zeev","12 MANAGEMENT OF RADIOACTIVE AND NON-RADIOACTIVE WASTES FROM NUCLEAR FACILITIES","One of the primary concerns with the long-term performance of storage systems for spent nuclear fuel (SNF) is the potential for corrosion due to deliquescence of salts deposited as aerosols on the surface of the canister, which is typically made of austentic stainless steel. In regions of high residual weld stresses, this may lead to localized stress-corrosion cracking (SCC). The ability to detect and image SCC at an early stage (long before the cracks are susceptible to propagate through the thickness of the canister wall and leaks of radioactive material may occur) is essential to the performance evaluation and licensing process of the storage systems. In this paper, we explore a number of nondestructive testing techniques to detect and image SCC in austenitic stainless steel. Our attention is focused on a small rectangular sample of 1× 2 in<sup>2</sup> with two cracks of mm-scale sizes. The techniques explored in this paper include nonlinear resonant ultrasound spectroscopy (NRUS) for detection, Linear Elastodynamic Gradient Imaging Technique (LEGIT), ultrasonic C-scan, vibrothermography, and synchrotron X-ray diffraction for imaging. Results obtained from these techniques are compared. Cracks of mm-scale sizes can be detected and imaged with all the techniques explored in this study.","Elsevier","","Sandia National Lab.

"Dry cask radiation shielding validation and estimation of cask surface dose rate with MAVRIC during long-term storage","Gao, Yuan; McFerran, Noah J.; Enqvist, Andreas; Tulenko, James E.; Baciak, James E.","12 MANAGEMENT OF RADIOACTIVE AND NON-RADIOACTIVE WASTES FROM NUCLEAR FACILITIES; experiment validation; Monte Carlo; SCALE 6.2.3; dose rate; dry cask storage; spent nuclear fuel","The dry storage cask became a semi-permanent solution for spent nuclear fuel since no permanent solution has been finalized over the past three decades. Considering the difficulty of deep geological repository projects in many aspects, prolonging the service life of dry casks longer than a few decades has become an option for spent nuclear fuel storage. It must be ensured that dry cask safety objectives, including radiation shielding, criticality safety, structure health, decay heat removal, and containment be fulfilled during the prolonged service life. This paper presents numerical modeling results of the radiation dose rate distribution on a TN-32 cask surface aged up to 300 years. The numerical modeling method was validated with measurement data, and the difference between the calculated results and measurement data in the total dose rate is 7%. The detailed radiation distribution variations over cask surfaces along the axial and radial directions for 300 years of storage were obtained, and their azimuthal angular dependence was established. The maximum total dose rate over the cask surfaces is less than 10 mrem/hour (9.258 ± 0.212 mrem/hour) after 40 years, and this outcome fulfills all dose rate requirements from 10 CFR 71.47(b). After 300 years of storage, the average total dose rates on the side surface and top surface are 0.150 ± 0.007mremmrem/hour and 0.057 ± 0.003mremmrem/hour, respectively, while the maxima are 0.601 ± 0.014 mrem/hour and 0.112 ± 0.006 mrem/hour, respectively. The variations in the fuel gamma ray, structure gamma ray, neutron and secondary gamma-ray contributions to the total dose rate are presented and analyzed in this work. The neutron and gamma-ray dose rate contributions by energy group are presented and analyzed at the cask top, mid-plane, and bottom at the selected storage times.","Elsevier","","Univ. of Mississippi, Oxford, MS (United States)","USDOE Office of Nuclear Energy (NE)","","United States","2019-10-26T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: Annals of Nuclear Energy (Oxford); Journal Volume: 140","","Medium: ED; Size: Article No. 107145","","","NE0008400; DE–NE0008400","Journal ID: ISSN 0306-4549; PII: S0306454919306553; TRN: US2211332","10.1016/j.anucene.2019.107145","","2022-09-27T00:00:00Z","1801212","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/1801212","https://www.osti.gov/servlets/purl/1801212","Annals of Nuclear Energy (Oxford)","","140"

The creation of the international DECOVALEX Project, now running for over 25 years, was initially motivated by the recognition that prediction of these coupled effects is an essential part of the performance and safety assessment of geologic disposal systems for radioactive waste and spent nuclear fuel. Later it was realized that these processes also play a critical role in other subsurface engineering activities, such as storage of CO<sub>2</sub>, exploration of enhanced geothermal systems, and unconventional oil and gas production through hydraulic fracturing. Research teams from radioactive waste management organizations, national research institutes, regulatory agencies, universities, as well as industry and consulting groups have participated in the DECOVALEX Project, providing a wide range of perspectives and solutions to these complex problems. Analysis and comparative modeling of state-of-the-art field and laboratory experiments has been at the core of the collaborative work, with an increasing focus on characterizing uncertainty and blind prediction of experimental results. Over these 25 years, many of the major advances in this field of research have been made through DECOVALEX, as evidenced by three books, seven journal special issues, and a good number of seminal papers that have emerged from the DECOVALEX modeling work. Examples of specific research advances will be presented in this paper to illustrate the significant impact of DECOVALEX on the current state-of-the-art of understanding and modeling coupled THMC processes. These examples range from the modeling of large-scale in situ heater tests representing mock-ups of nuclear waste disposal tunnels, to studies of fluid flow and chemical-mechanical coupling in heterogeneous fractures, and to the numerical analysis of controlled-injection meso-scale fault slip experiments.","Elsevier","","Lawrence Berkeley National Lab.

Here, the colorless crystalline compound melts at 118 °C and can be melted and recrystallized several times with little decomposition.

The novel reagent is an octadentate complexant that resembles diethylenetriamine-N,N,N',N"",N""-pentaacetic acid (DTPA), but a single N-acetate pendant arm was substituted with a N-2-pyrazinylmethyl functional group. Thermodynamic studies of ligand protonation and trivalent lanthanide, americium and curium, complexation by N-2-pyrazinylmethyldiethylenetriamine-N,N',N"",N""-tetraacetic acid (DTTA-PzM) emphasize the strong electron withdrawing influence of the N-2-pyrazinylmethyl group. Particularly, DTTA-PzM is more acidic compared to a N-2-pyridinylmethyl-substituted structural equivalent, DTTA-PyM, with a substantial lowering of pK7, corresponding to the protonation of a second aliphatic amine site. The participation of the pyrizyl nitrogen in the metal ion coordination sphere is observed from the fluorescence lifetime decay measurements of metal hydration and the interpretation of the stability constants for ML– and MHL(aq) complexes. The overall conditional stability constants for the trivalent f-element complexation by DTTA-PzM complexes decrease, relative to DTTA-PyM, as expected based on the lower basicity of pyrazine in water relative to pyridine. Replacement of the N-2-pyridinylmethyl group with N-2-pyrazinylmethyl, while enhancing the total acidity of DTTA-PzM, also reduces its softness, as manifested by a small lowering of β<sub>101</sub><sup>Am/Nd</sup> and liquid–liquid separation of trivalent lanthanides from trivalent americium.

This is particularly relevant in decommissioning and clean-up of nuclear facilities, such as legacy fuel ponds and silos at the Sellafield site, UK, and in long-term radioactive waste geodisposal. In this study, the product of metallic uranium (U) corrosion under anaerobic, alkaline conditions was characterised, and the interaction of this product with silicate solutions was investigated. The U metal corrosion product consisted of crystalline UO<sub>2</sub> nanoparticles (5-10 nm) that aggregated to form clusters larger than 20 nm. Sequential ultrafiltration indicated that a small fraction of the U metal corrosion product was colloidal. When the uranium corrosion product was reacted with silicate solutions under anaerobic conditions, ultrafiltration indicated a stable colloidal uranium fraction was formed. Extended X-ray absorption fine structure (EXAFS) spectroscopy and high resolution TEM confirmed that the majority of U was still present as UO<sub>2</sub> after several months of exposure to silicate solutions, but an amorphous silica coating was present on the UO<sub>2</sub> surface. This silica coating is believed to be responsible for formation of the UO<sub>2</sub> colloid fraction. Atomic-resolution scanning TEM (STEM) indicated some migration of U into the silica-coating of the UO<sub>2</sub> particles as non-crystalline U(IV)-silicate, suggesting alteration of UO<sub>2</sub> at the UO<sub>2</sub>-silica interface had occurred. This alteration at the UO<sub>2</sub>-silica interface is a potential pathway to the formation of U-silicates (e.g. coffinite, USiO<sub>4</sub>).","Elsevier","","Pacific Northwest National Lab.

Horizontal drillhole disposal has safety, operational and economic benefits: the repository is deep in the brine-saturated zone far below aquifers in a reducing environment of formations that can be shown to have been isolated from the surface for exceedingly long times; its depth provides safety against inadvertent intrusion, earthquakes and near-surface perturbations; it can be placed close to the reactors and interim storage facilities, minimizing transportation; disposal costs per ton of waste can be kept substantially lower than for mined repositories by its smaller size, reduced infrastructure needs and staged implementation; and, if desired, the waste could be retrieved using “fishing” technology. In the proposed disposal concept, corrosion-resistant canisters containing unmodified fuel assemblies from commercial reactors would be placed end-to-end in up to 50 cm diameter horizontal drillholes, a configuration that reduces mechanical stresses and keeps the temperatures below the boiling point of the brine. Other high-level wastes, such as capsules containing <sup>137</sup>Cs and <sup>90</sup>Sr, can be disposed in small-diameter horizontal drillholes. We provide an overview of this novel disposal concept and its technology, discuss some of its safety aspects and compare it to mined repositories and the deep vertical borehole disposal concept.","MDPI AG","","Lawrence Berkeley National Lab.

This work outlines the assessment basis and safety assessment aspects of a deep borehole disposal safety case. The safety case presented here is specific to deep borehole disposal of Cs and Sr capsules, but is generally applicable to other waste forms, such as spent nuclear fuel. The safety assessments for pre-closure and post-closure are briefly summarized from other sources; key issues for confidence enhancement are described in greater detail. These confidence enhancement analyses require building the technical basis for geologically old, reducing, highly saline brines at the depth of waste emplacement, and using reactive-transport codes to predict their movement in post-closure. The development and emplacement of borehole seals above the waste emplacement zone is also important to confidence enhancement.</p>","MDPI AG","","Sandia National Lab.

"Researching the Effects of Long-Term Dry Storage on Commercial Spent Nuclear Fuel","Montgomery, Rose","11 NUCLEAR FUEL CYCLE AND FUEL MATERIALS; 12 MANAGEMENT OF RADIOACTIVE AND NON-RADIOACTIVE WASTES FROM NUCLEAR FACILITIES","When the fuel in a nuclear reactor no longer contributes efficiently to power production, it is discharged and stored onsite in a water-filled spent fuel pool. When nuclear power plants in the United States were originally designed, it was expected that onsite storage would be temporary. The used nuclear fuel, also known as spent nuclear fuel (SNF), was to be removed from the storage pools after only a few years of cooling and sent for reprocessing. However, commercial reprocessing was not implemented in the United States, and utility spent fuel pools began running out of room. In order to continue power production, nuclear utilities began expanding onsite fuel storage capacities, first by increasing the density of fuel in the fuel pool racks, and then by developing and implementing dry storage casks. The dry storage casks are stored onsite by each utility at a licensed and secured independent spent fuel storage installation (ISFSI). Dry storage casks are robust systems typically consisting of a sealed metal cylinder surrounded by a combination of steel and concrete to provide radiation shielding. The first dry storage casks were loaded with SNF in 1986. Currently there are over 3,000 loaded dry storage casks, and approximately 200 new casks are being placed into service annually at operating nuclear power plants nationwide. Multiple nuclear power plant sites in the United States have shut down and completed decommissioning activities except for the removal of fuel in dry storage. Eventually, the 75,000+ tons of discharged SNF at more than 70 secured locations will need to be safely and securely transported to a new location(s) for eventual disposition. The continued safety and security of this material must be assured.","American Society for Quality (ASQ)","","Oak Ridge National Lab.

Literature has shown the placement and number of the -CF3 functionalities on the aryl rings proximate to the ligating sulfurs can significantly impact Ln3+/An3+ extraction and separation factors, but the complexation thermodynamics of -CF3 derivatized aryl dithiophosphinates have not been considered to date. This systematic study considers the complexation of three aryl CF3-substituted dithiophosphinates - bis(phenyl) dithiophosphinate (LI), (o-trifluoromethylphenyl)(phenyl) dithiophosphinate (LII), and bis(o-trifluoromethylphenyl) dithiophosphinate (LIII), with Nd3+ in an ethanol environment. The chelating ability of Nd(III) by these ligands follows the order of LIII > LII > LI, which is in line with the reported extraction efficiency. The positive ΔS, as well as positive ΔH, suggests Nd3+ chelation is entropy driven and effective desolvation is critical to enable Nd3+ interaction with otherwise weakly interacting sulfur containing ligands. EXAFS results confirm thermodynamic investigations and suggest that LI can only form up to 1:2 (M/L) complexes, while LII and LIII form up to 1:3 complexes with Nd3+. All three LIII anions have bidentate interactions with Nd(III), but two LII anions have bidentate interactions with Nd3+ while the third LII anion is monodentate. The significant increase in ΔS with each o-CF3 addition suggests aiding desolvation could be central in enabling f-element interaction with weakly interacting donor groups and this report provides an approach to controlling f-element desolvation as an innovative f-element chelating strategy.","American Chemical Society (ACS)","","Los Alamos National Lab.

Yet, assessing a site’s ability to continuously function is challenging due to parameter uncertainty and compounding nonlinear processes. In lieu of unavailable site data for model calibration, we present a workflow to include multiple sources of surrogate data and reduced-order models to validate parameters for a long-term erosion assessment of a low-level radioactive nuclear waste repository. We apply this new workflow to a low-level waste repository on mesas in Los Alamos National Laboratory in New Mexico. To account for parameter uncertainty, we simulate high-, moderate-, and low-erosion cases. The assessment extends to 10,000 years, which results in large erosion uncertainties, but is necessary given the nature of the interred waste. Our long-term erosion analysis shows that high-erosion scenarios produce rounded mesa tops and partially filled canyons, diverging from the moderate-erosion case that results in gullies and sharp mesa rims. Our novel model parameterization workflow and modeling exercise demonstrates the utility of long-term assessments, identifies sources of erosion forecast uncertainty, and demonstrates the utility of landscape evolution model development. We end with a discussion on methods to reduce assessment uncertainty and increase model confidence.</p>","MDPI","","Los Alamos National Lab.

"Structural Characterization of Ternary Salt Melts for Low Activity Waste Applications","Nienhuis, Emily; Saleh, Muad; McCloy, John","12 MANAGEMENT OF RADIOACTIVE AND NON-RADIOACTIVE WASTES FROM NUCLEAR FACILITIES; Glass; x-ray diffraction (XRD); infrared (IR) spectroscopy","Reactions of alkali salts (nitrates, sulfates, carbonates, halides, borates) play a key role in the low temperature feed conversion occurring at the cold cap during processing of Hanford Low Activity Waste (LAW) glass melters. An alkali salt phase can sometimes form, and preferentially incorporate radionuclides of Cs, Cl, I, and Tc. During melting of the slurry feed, some of the feed components sequentially break down with increasing temperature to form gases (i.e., nitrates → NO<sub>x</sub>, carbonates → CO<sub>2</sub>, and boric acid → H<sub>2</sub>O) or partially volatilize (halides). Sulfate, however, tends not to volatilize but has limited solubility in the final borosilicate glass waste form. To improve understanding of these low temperature processes and their composition dependencies, a scoping study was undertaken to synthesize salt systems that remain amorphous at room temperature, thus facilitating structural study. Melts of equimolar ratios of K2SO4-ZnSO4 (a known ionic glass-forming system) with added nitrates, halides, or carbonates, were melted and quenched. Some of the materials formed single phase glasses and some underwent crystallization upon quenching. Characterization of these quenched materials by thermal analysis, infrared absorption, and diffraction was performed. Addition of other anions to the sulfate base glass resulted in a distortion of the sulfate tetrahedron, as evidenced by infrared absorption. Carbonates strongly promoted crystallization, mostly of carbonate phases. Nitrates promoted crystallization of ZnO, and the nitrate volatilized with some incorporating into the glass. Here, halides tended to incorporate into the glass, but the small (F) and large (I) halogens promoted crystallization of sulfate-containing crystals, while moderate sized (Cl) halogens produced single-phase ionic glasses.","Springer Nature","","Rutgers Univ., New Brunswick, NJ (United States)","USDOE Office of Environmental Management (EM); USDOE Office of Nuclear Energy (NE), Nuclear Energy University Program (NEUP)","","United States","2019-02-21T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: MRS Advances; Journal Volume: 4; Journal Issue: 17-18","","Medium: ED; Size: p. 1045-1056","","","NE0008597","Journal ID: ISSN 2059-8521; TRN: US2205451","10.1557/adv.2019.136","","2022-08-23T00:00:00Z","1749952","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/1749952","https://www.osti.gov/servlets/purl/1749952","MRS Advances","17-18","4"

Residual decay heat emanating from these waste forms leads to temperature increases within the drillhole and the surrounding host rock. The spacing of waste canisters and the configuration of the various barrier components within the horizontal drillhole can be designed such that the maximum temperatures remain below limits that are set for each element of the engineered and natural repository system. We present design calculations that examine the thermal evolution around heat-generating waste for a wide range of material properties and disposal configurations. Moreover, we evaluate alternative layouts of a monitoring system to be part of an in situ heater test that helps determine the thermal properties of the as-built repository system. A data-worth analysis is performed to ensure that sufficient information will be collected during the heater test so that subsequent model predictions of the thermal evolution around horizontal deposition holes will reliably estimate the maximum temperatures in the drillhole. The simulations demonstrate that the proposed drillhole disposal strategy can be flexibly designed to ensure dissipation of the heat generated by decaying nuclear waste. Moreover, an in situ heater test can provide the relevant data needed to develop a reliable prediction model of repository performance under as-built conditions.","MDPI AG","","Lawrence Berkeley National Lab.

An adaptable disposition approach was developed, and disposition of the sources was pursued. The approach involved a combination of source retrievals, disposal actions, and source ownership transfers. A new shielded shipping container was designed and deployed to aid in source retrievals. In a couple cases, incomplete source fabrication and shipping records prevented shipment, and those sources were left indefinitely with the customer in a safe configuration. Lastly, all the sources in the inventory were safely dispositioned in some way, and lessons learned from this effort are provided.","ASCE","","Oak Ridge National Lab.

The sludges mainly comprise Mg hydroxide and carbonate phases, contaminated with fission products and actinides, including Pu. Cementation and deep geological disposal is one option for the long-term management of this material, but there is a need to understand how Pu may be leached from the waste, if it is exposed to groundwater. Here, we show that cemented Mg(OH)<sub>2</sub> powder prepared with Pu(IV)<sub>aq</sub> is altered on contact with water to produce a visibly altered ‘leached zone’, which penetrates several hundred microns into the sample. In turn, this zone shows slow leaching of Pu, with long-term leaching rates between 1.8–4.4 × 10<sup>-5</sup>% of total Pu per day. Synchrotron micro-focus X-ray fluorescence mapping identified decreased Pu concentration within the ‘leached zone’. A comparison of micro-focus X-ray absorption spectroscopy (µ-XAS) spectra collected across both leached and unleached samples showed little variation, and indicated that Pu was present in a similar oxidation state and coordination environment. Fitting of the XANES spectra between single oxidation state standards and EXAFS modeling showed that Pu was present as a mixture of Pu(IV) and Pu(V). The change in Pu oxidation from the stock solution suggests that partial Pu oxidation occurred during sample ageing. Similarity in the XAS spectra from all samples, with different local chemistries, indicated that the Pu oxidation state was not perturbed by macro-scale variations in cement chemistry, surface oxidation, sample aging, or the leaching treatment. These experiments have demonstrated the potential for leaching of Pu from cementitious waste forms, and its underlying significance requires further investigation.","MDPI","","Argonne National Lab.

These interactions have the potential to change the structure of the RoM salt surrounding the canister, possibly altering long-term containment of the source. An experiment is in progress at the Waste Isolation Pilot Plant (WIPP), New Mexico, in which a heated canister was placed on the floor of an open drift, covered in a pile of RoM salt, and energized with 1000 W. Temperature in the RoM salt pile had stabilized after about 15 d, allowing evaluation of the heat-up period of the ongoing experiment. Using a multiphase porous flow simulator that has been modified to handle salt-specific coupled processes, we examined coupled thermal–hydrological–chemical behavior in the RoM salt pile. Our simulations suggest that for the relatively dry cases examined, porosity changes within RoM salt in a generic salt repository are likely to be minor in the period between waste emplacement and plastic closure of the drift. The primary sensitivity for porosity change is to the early moisture content of the RoM salt used to cover the canister. Secondary influences include moisture availability from the disturbed rock zone (DRZ) surrounding the drift and the capillary pressure ratio between the DRZ and the RoM salt. Early changes in porosity and permeability may be affected by moisture content, but this was not observed in the test. Such changes would be most likely to occur when using damp RoM salt or if waste is emplaced in a drift immediately following opening of the drift before evaporative dewatering of the drift walls occurs.","Wiley Blackwell (John Wiley & Sons)","","Los Alamos National Lab.

To analyze the time-temperature history of the feed in a cold-cap during nuclear waste vitrification, this work focuses on understanding how the main cold-cap body forms, how the aqueous feed slurry interacts with the cold-cap, and estimating the cold-cap heat conductivity. To simulate the conditions during cold-cap formation, samples were prepared by rapid water evaporation from slurry feed. After water evaporated from the sample, a fresh slurry with tracer was poured onto the dry sample. X-ray fluorescence was then used to investigate the degree of penetration and/or mixing between the incoming slurry and the original sample. We show that the slurry does not interact or mix with the previously dry cold-cap crust, but that water-soluble components concentrate at the bottom of the boiling pools, where most of the water evaporates. Further, using the rate of water evaporation, the heat conductivity of the cold-cap was calculated from the measured temperature profile.

"Multi-glass investigation of Stage III glass dissolution behavior from 22 to 90 °C triggered by the addition of zeolite phases","Parruzot, Benjamin; Ryan, Joseph V.; George, Jaime L.; Motkuri, Radha Kishan; Bonnett, Jeff F.; Seymour, Lorraine M.; Derewinski, Miroslaw A.","12 MANAGEMENT OF RADIOACTIVE AND NON-RADIOACTIVE WASTES FROM NUCLEAR FACILITIES","Evaluating the corrosion of glass waste forms for nuclear waste immobilization is a prime metric of their performance. Stage III behavior, the delayed acceleration of glass corrosion, remains the most potentially impactful aspect of glass corrosion behavior. Using the addition of various zeolite phases to trigger this effect, the properties of Stage III behavior were evaluated for three high-level waste glass compositions: SRL-202A, SON68, and AFCI. We demonstrate that Stage III behavior can occur at temperatures as low as 22°C, with rate acceleration observed at 90 and 70 °C for all studied glasses, and at 40 °C and 22 °C for two of the compositions (SRL-202A and SON68). Using an Arrhenius fit, the activation energy of the process was found to be highly uncertain, with values between 39 and 68 kJ·mol<sup>-1</sup>. Stage III behavior was triggered for each of the glasses studied by the addition of each of the four zeolites studied (Na-P1, Na-P2, Analcime, and Chabazite). The rates of alteration during Stage III varied very little, from 0.0058 to 0.023 g·m<sup>-2</sup>·d<sup>-1</sup> for the accelerated region immediately following zeolite addition. The acceleration was discovered to be transient, with the alteration rate decreasing and then accelerating again as the experiments proceeded. The solution composition was compared to the strong base/weak acid discriminator developed by Jantzen et al. and it was found that the addition of zeolites can overcome slightly non-optimal solution conditions for zeolite formation to trigger Stage III behavior.","Elsevier","","Pacific Northwest National Lab.

Here in this paper, the efficacy of organoclay OCB and OCM, and granular activated carbon (GAC) as sorbents to bind I<sup>-</sup> and IO<sub>3</sub><sup>-</sup> from artificial groundwater (AGW) was examined. These sorbents were highly effective at removing I<sup>-</sup> and IO<sub>3</sub><sup>-</sup> from AGW under oxic condition, with the adsorption capacity up to 30 mg I/g sorbent.

"Analysis of Krypton-85 Legacy Waste Forms: Part II","Jubin, Robert Thomas; Bruffey, Stephanie","12 MANAGEMENT OF RADIOACTIVE AND NON-RADIOACTIVE WASTES FROM NUCLEAR FACILITIES; Krypton-85; waste form; HIP; zeolite","During a removal of legacy materials from one hot cell at the Idaho National Laboratory in 2010, five metal capsules and some loose zeolite material were identified as krypton (Kr) immobilization test specimens produced in the late 1970s under the Airborne Waste Management Program (AWMP). This AWMP research and development effort examined the encapsulation of 85Kr within a collapsed zeolite structure for use as a potential waste form for long-term storage. The recovered capsules appeared to have been placed to the side and remained untouched after the AWMP was halted in the mid-1980s. These reclaimed capsules and loose material presented a unique opportunity to study a potential <sup>85</sup>Kr waste form after three half-lives had elapsed. The first phase of this study included two parts: The first was to assess the physical condition of the capsule walls, and the second was to examine the Kr-containing material within the capsules. The first part of this study was previously reported and noted that substantial corrosion was observed throughout each capsule wall of the two previously breached capsules that were examined. One of these capsules had been hot isostatic pressed (HIPed) and one was not HIPed. The second part of the study examined the materials contained in the two previously breached capsules. There appears to be a relatively uniform distribution of Kr and rubidium throughout the pellets examined. The chemical composition of the pellets appears to be consistent with 5A molecular sieves. The material contained within the HIPed capsules showed ~1 at. % lead (Pb). The origin of the Pb is currently indeterminate. X-ray diffraction analysis shows a significant shift from the 5A structure, most likely due to the Kr encapsulation/sintering process that occurred when the samples were made. Calculations based on the energy dispersive spectrometry elemental analysis show a residual Kr level within the pellets that is within a factor of 2 of the reported Kr capacities for this type of processed material. This provides a clear indication that a significant fraction of the Kr initially encapsulated in the material remained within the waste form even following a significant breach of the capsule wall. As a result, it would appear that this Kr immobilization method, even in non-HIPed form, is very promising as a waste form for long-term storage. The successful analysis of these two breached capsules forms a solid basis for the future analysis of the remaining unbreached capsules, which offers the opportunity to provide an even more complete understanding of the long-term Kr retention performance of this promising waste form.","Taylor & Francis - formerly American Nuclear Society (ANS)","","Oak Ridge National Lab.

In this study, we use molecular dynamics simulations to investigate the coordination structure and mobility of water and alkali metals (Li, Na, K, Cs) inside a 1 nm diameter cylindrical silica nanopore as a function of surface charge density, a model system particularly relevant to the alteration kinetics of silicate glasses and minerals in geologic formations. We find that the presence of a negative surface charge and adsorbed counterions within the pore strongly impacts water structure and dynamics. In particular, it significantly orients water O-H bonds toward the surface and slows water diffusion by almost 1 order of magnitude. Ion crowding in the charged nanopore enhances the tendency of counterions to coordinate closely with the silica surface, which moderates the impact of ions on water dynamics. Co-ions are strongly excluded from the nanopore at all surface charges, suggesting that the 1 nm diameter cylindrical silica nanopores likely exhibit nearly ideal semipermeable membrane transport properties.","American Chemical Society","","Energy Frontier Research Centers (EFRC) (United States).

"Local ordering and interfacial structure between spinel crystal and aluminosilicate glasses from molecular dynamics simulations","Sun, Wei; Du, Jincheng","12 MANAGEMENT OF RADIOACTIVE AND NON-RADIOACTIVE WASTES FROM NUCLEAR FACILITIES; Aluminosilicate glass; interface structure; local ordering; molecular dynamics simulations; spinel","Molecular dynamics simulations were performed to investigate the interfaces of soda magnesia aluminosilicate glass and MgAl<sub>2</sub>O<sub>4</sub> spinel crystals. The glass structures were first generated and characterized. It was found that the glass–forming network consists of fourfold coordinated [SiO<sub>4</sub>] and [AlO<sub>4</sub>] tetrahedra connected through corner sharing with Na<sup>+</sup> and Ca<sup>2+</sup> acting as modifiers or charge compensators. The glass and crystal interfaces were then constructed on low energy spinel surfaces with special measures to ensure two natural interfaces. The interfacial structures were characterized by z–density profile, pair distribution function and coordination number analysis. The results show that there exist local ordering on the glass side and preferential adsorption of specific cation near the interface. Cation coordination analyses showed that aluminum ions changed from mainly fourfold coordination in the glass to five and sixfold coordination near the interface suggesting a gradual change in structural role of aluminum from the glass to the crystal. Here, the ordering and segregation of cations, as well as change in aluminum coordination, at the glass/crystal interface strongly suggest that the ordered crystal structure influence the atom distribution and local structure of the adjacent glasses and this ordering can be the initial stage of nucleation or crystal growth.","American Ceramic Society","","Rutgers Univ., New Brunswick, NJ (United States)","USDOE Office of Environmental Management (EM); USDOE Office of Nuclear Energy (NE), Nuclear Energy University Program (NEUP)","","United States","2018-08-01T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: International Journal of Applied Glass Science; Journal Volume: 10; Journal Issue: 1","","Medium: ED; Size: p. 41-56","","","NE0008597","Journal ID: ISSN 2041-1286; TRN: US2205439","10.1111/ijag.12554","","2022-08-23T00:00:00Z","1749875","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/1749875","https://www.osti.gov/servlets/purl/1749875","International Journal of Applied Glass Science","1","10"

At a molecular level Al is cycling between tetrahedral (Td) coordination in solution to octahedral (Oh) in the solid. We explored dissolution of Al(OH)3 that was used to produce variably saturated aluminate (Al(OH)4–)-containing solutions under alkaline conditions (pH >13) with in situ 27Al magic angle spinning (MAS)–nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy, and interrogated the results with ab initio molecular dynamics (AIMD) simulations complemented with chemical shift calculations. The collective results highlight the overall stability of the solvation structure for Td Al in the Al(OH)4– oxyanion as a function of both temperature and Al concentration. The observed chemical shift did not change significantly even when the Al concentration in solution became supersaturated upon cooling and limited precipitation of the octahedral Al(OH)3 phase occurred. However, subtle changes in Al(OH)4– speciation correlated with the dissolution/precipitation reaction were found. AIMD-informed chemical shift calculations indicate that measurable perturbations should begin when the Al(OH)4–···Na+ distance is less than 6 Å, increasing dramatically at shorter distances, coinciding with appreciable changes to the electrostatic interaction and reorganization of the Al(OH)4– solvation shell. The integrated findings thus suggest that, under conditions incipient to and concurrent with gibbsite crystallization, nominally expected contact ion pairs are insignificant and instead medium-range (4–6 Å) solvent-separated Al(OH)4–···Na+ pairs predominate. Moreover, the fact that these medium-range interactions bear directly on resulting gibbsite characteristics was demonstrated by detailed microscopic and X-ray diffraction analysis and by progressive changes in the fwhm of the Oh resonance, as measured by in situ NMR. Sluggish gibbsite crystallization may arise from the activation energy associated with disrupting this robust medium-range ion pair interaction.","American Chemical Society (ACS)","","Oak Ridge National Lab.

Glasses in the Na2O–Al2O3–B2O3–Fe2O3–SiO2 system with varying Al2O3/Fe2O3 and Na2O/Fe2O3 ratios have been synthesized by melt-quench technique and studied for their crystallization behavior in different heating atmospheres—air, inert (N2), and reducing (96%N2–4%H2). The compositional dependence of iron redox chemistry in glasses and the impact of heating environment and crystallization on iron coordination in glass-ceramics have been investigated by Mössbauer spectroscopy and vibrating sample magnetometry. While iron coordination in glasses and glass-ceramics changed as a function of glass chemistry, the heating atmosphere during crystallization exhibited minimal effect on iron redox. The change in heating atmosphere did not affect the phase assemblage but did affect the microstructural evolution. While glass-ceramics produced as a result of heat treatment in air and N2 atmospheres developed a golden/brown colored iron-rich layer on their surface, those produced in a reducing atmosphere did not exhibit any such phenomenon. Furthermore, while this iron-rich layer was observed in glass-ceramics with varying Al2O3/Fe2O3 ratio, it was absent from glass-ceramics with varying Na2O/Fe2O3 ratio. An explanation of these results has been provided on the basis of kinetics of diffusion of oxygen and network modifiers in the glasses under different thermodynamic conditions. The plausible implications of the formation of iron-rich layer on the surface of glass-ceramics on the chemical durability of high-level nuclear waste glasses have been discussed.","American Ceramic Society","","Idaho National Lab.

In the case of the low-level radioactive waste (LLRW) repository, the confinement of the species must be guaranteed for more than 300 years. In this context, the evaluation of the proposed materials must be performed under accelerated laboratory tests. One type of LLRW consists of ashes that result from the incineration of solid combustible radioactive waste. In Argentina, one of the proposed projects is to place these ashes inside steel drums and immobilized them by a cementation process. The issue to be resolved is whether the steel drums will undergo internal corrosion depending on the presence of certain deleterious species. The aim of the present work is to evaluate the corrosion susceptibility of steel drums containing simulated cemented incineration ashes. To this purpose, a special type of specimen was designed and the corrosion process was followed up for almost 4 years. It was found that, although the deleterious effect of chloride is undeniable, corrosion rates are not as high as to compromise the integrity of the steel drums for a design period of 300 years.","","","","","","United States","2019-01-15T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: Journal of Materials Engineering and Performance; Journal Volume: 28; Journal Issue: 1; Other Information: Copyright (c) 2019 ASM International; http://www.springer-ny.com; Country of input: International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA)","","Medium: X; Size: page(s) 519-525","","","","Journal ID: ISSN 1059-9495; CODEN: JMEPEG; TRN: US19M5223011007","10.1007/S11665-018-3814-8","","2021-03-26T00:00:00Z","22971008","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/22971008","","Journal of Materials Engineering and Performance","1","28"

This study presents a tiered approach to model validation consisting of a series of progressively more complex test cases designed to model the physics occurring in the full-scale system.

Finally, four hierarchical levels are defined in a validation pyramid and built up in levels of increasing complexity from unit problems to subsystem cases, to pilot-scale systems, and then to the full-scale system.","Taylor & Francis - formerly American Nuclear Society (ANS)","","Idaho National Lab.

"An Alternative to the Continued Accumulation of Separated Plutonium in Japan: Dry Cask Storage of Spent Fuel","Takubo, Masafumi; Von Hippel, Frank N.","11 NUCLEAR FUEL CYCLE AND FUEL MATERIALS; 12 MANAGEMENT OF RADIOACTIVE AND NON-RADIOACTIVE WASTES FROM NUCLEAR FACILITIES; Plutonium stocks; plutonium use; plutonium disposal; spent fuel reprocessing; spent fuel storage; nuclear power in Japan","As of the end of 2017, Japan had a stockpile of 48 tons of separated plutonium. It will take more than a decade for Japan to convert most of that plutonium into “mixed-oxide” (MOX) fuel and load it into power reactors licensed to use such fuel. This is a very costly program. Including the cost of reprocessing, MOX fuel costs about ten times more than the low-enriched-uranium fuel that otherwise would be used by these reactors. Yet Japan has a policy to start separating more plutonium from spent reactor fuel as soon as the Rokkasho Reprocessing Plant can be put into operation – currently projected for 2021 after 24 years of delay due to a variety of technical problems and upgrades in safety requirements. Japan’s government remains committed to this costly and troubled program primarily because, pending the availability of additional spent-fuel storage space on or off site, reprocessing is seen as the only way to get spent fuel out of reactor pools that are getting full. Because of concerns about the safety of dense-packed spent-fuel pools, however, the prefectures and towns hosting Japan’s power reactors are beginning to accept on-site storage of spent fuel in dry casks. This is the option the United States and many other countries chose after they cancelled their reprocessing programs and their powerplant pools filled up. Its increasing availability in Japan, if backed by a determined policy to accelerate its introduction, should make it possible to cancel reprocessing in Japan as well.","","","Univ. of Michigan, Ann Arbor, MI (United States)","USDOE National Nuclear Security Administration (NNSA), Office of Nonproliferation and Verification Research and Development (NA-22)","","United States","2018-07-03T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: Journal for Peace and Nuclear Disarmament; Journal Volume: 1; Journal Issue: 2","","Medium: ED; Size: p. 281-304","","","NA0002534","Journal ID: ISSN 2575-1654","10.1080/25751654.2018.1527886","","2019-06-12T00:00:00Z","1524431","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/1524431","https://www.osti.gov/servlets/purl/1524431","Journal for Peace and Nuclear Disarmament","2","1"

Matthew; Tratnyek, Paul G.; Rosso, Kevin M.; Lukens, Wayne W.; Qafoku, Nikolla P.","12 MANAGEMENT OF RADIOACTIVE AND NON-RADIOACTIVE WASTES FROM NUCLEAR FACILITIES; technetium sulfide; radioactive waste; redox reactivity; X-ray absorption spectroscopy; environmental mobility; cementitious waste forms","Technetium (Tc) contamination remains a major environmental problem at nuclear reprocessing sites, e.g., the Hanford Site, WA, USA. At these site, Tc is present in liquid waste destined for immobilization in a waste form or has been released into the subsurface environment. The high environmental risk associated with Tc is due to its long half-life (213,000 years) and the mobility of the oxidized anionic species Tc(VII)O4-. Under reducing conditions, TcO4- is readily reduced to Tc(IV), which commonly exists as a relatively insoluble and therefore immobile, hydrous Tc oxide (TcO2•nH2O). The stability of Tc(IV) sequestered as solid phases depends on the solubility of the solid and susceptibility to re-oxidation to TcO4-, which in turn depend on the (bio-geo)chemical conditions of the environment and/or nuclear waste streams. Unfortunately, the solubility of crystalline TcO2 or amorphous TcO2•H2O is still above the maximum contaminant level (MCL) established by the US EPA (900 pCi/L), and the kinetics of TcO2 oxidative dissolution can be on the order of days to years. In addition to oxygen, sulfur can form complexes that can significantly affect the adsorption, solubility and re-oxidation potential of Tc, especially Tc(IV). The principal technetium sulfides areTcS2 and Tc2S7 but much less is known about the mechanisms of formation, stabilization and re-oxidation of Tc sulfides. A common assumption is that sulfides are less soluble that their oxyhydrous counterparts. Determination of the molecular structure of Tc2S7 in particular has been hampered by the propensity of this phase to precipitate as an amorphous substance. Recent work indicates that the oxidation state of Tc in Tc2S7 is Tc(IV), in apparent contradiction to its nominal stoichiometry. Technetium is relatively immobile in reduced sediments and soils, but in many cases the exact sink for Tc has not been identified. Experiments and modeling have demonstrated that both abiotic and biologic mechanisms can exert strong controls on Tc mobility and that Tc binding or uptake into sulfide phases can occur. These and similar investigations also show that extended exposure to oxidizing conditions results in transformation of sulfide-stabilized Tc(IV) to a Tc(IV)O2-like phase without formation of measurable dissolved TcO4-, suggesting a solid-state transformation in which Tc(IV)-associated sulfide is preferentially oxidized before the Tc(IV) cation. This transformation of Tc(IV) sulfides to Tc(IV) oxides may be the main process that limits remobilization of Tc as Tc(VII)O4-. The efficacy of the final waste form to retain Tc also strongly depends on the ability of oxidizing species to enter the waste and convert Tc(IV) to Tc(VII). Many waste form designs are reducing (e.g., salt stone), therefore, attempt to restrict access of oxidizing species such that diffusion is the rate-limiting step in remobilization of Tc","American Chemical Society","","Lawrence Berkeley National Lab.

Analysis of leaching simulations and experiments shows that, depending on solution compositions (dissolved CO{sub 2} concentration, pH, Ca ion concentration), calcite precipitation occurring during leaching of cement in contact with carbonated brine can have a significant impact on cement reactivity, in some instances leading to complete arrest of reactivity via calcium carbonate ''pore-clogging''. We present modeling and experimental results that examine the range of solution conditions that can lead to pore-clogging.

In this paper, it is shown that 2D covalent organic frameworks (COFs) with unique structures possess all the traits to be well suited as a platform for the deployment of highly efficient sorbents such that they exhibit remarkable performance, as demonstrated by uranium capture. The chelating groups laced on the open 1D channels exhibit exceptional accessibility, allowing significantly higher utilization efficiency. In addition, the 2D extended polygons packed closely in an eclipsed fashion bring chelating groups in adjacent layers parallel to each other, which may facilitate their cooperation, thereby leading to high affinity toward specific ions. As a result, the amidoxime-functionalized COFs far outperform their corresponding amorphous analogs in terms of adsorption capacities, kinetics, and affinities. Specifically, COF-TpAb-AO is able to reduce various uranium contaminated water samples from 1 ppm to less than 0.1 ppb within several minutes, well below the drinking water limit (30 ppb), as well as mine uranium from spiked seawater with an exceptionally high uptake capacity of 127 mg g<sup>-1</sup>.

Although several showcases of 3D printed concrete structures are available worldwide, many challenges remain at the technical and processing level. Currently available high-performance cement-based materials cannot be directly 3D printed, because of inadequate rheological and stiffening properties. Active rheology control (ARC) and active stiffening control (ASC) will provide new ways of extending the material palette for 3D printing applications. From an economic point of view, digitally manufactured concrete (DFC) will induce changes in the stakeholders as well as in the cost structure. Although it is currently too ambitious to quantitatively present the cost structure, DFC presents many potential opportunities to increase cost-effectiveness of construction processes. The environmental impact of 3D printing with concrete has to be seen in relation to the shape complexity of the structure. Implementing structural optimization as well as functional hybridization as design strategies allows the use of material only where is structurally or functionally needed. This design optimization increases shape complexity, but also reduces material use in DFC. As a result, it is expected that for structures with the same functionality, DFC will environmentally perform better over the entire service life in comparison with conventionally produced concrete structures.","","Available from http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.cemconres.2018.06.001","","","","United States","2018-10-15T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: Cement and Concrete Research; Journal Volume: 112; Other Information: Copyright (c) 2017 Elsevier Science B.V., Amsterdam, The Netherlands, All rights reserved.; Country of input: International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA)","","Medium: X; Size: page(s) 25-36","","","","Journal ID: ISSN 0008-8846; CODEN: CCNRAI; PII: S000888461731219X; TRN: US19W2973050925","10.1016/J.CEMCONRES.2018.06.001","","2020-10-15T00:00:00Z","22806530","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/22806530","","Cement and Concrete Research","","112"

Good volume matches of host cages and guest compounds are nonetheless not the only structural requirement for ensuring viable nuclear waste storage. Host structures also need to be stable enough to withstand the typical environmental conditions of long-term storage of spent nuclear fuel. To this end, the nanoporous cage topologies of neodymium and gadolinium ultraphosphate, NdP{sub 5}O{sub 14} and GdP{sub 5}O{sub 14}, are investigated as a function of temperature. Topological analysis shows that, while both compounds are essentially isostructural, thus displaying the same type of cage structures, the cage volumes of NdP{sub 5}O{sub 14} are significantly larger than those of GdP{sub 5}O{sub 14}, with one stark exception. This exception concerns the cage of NdP{sub 5}O{sub 14} whose 8/4 topology lacks structural cross-linking that would otherwise give it much more strength. This 'squashed' cage appears to owe its origins to the specific nature of crystallographic twinning in NdP{sub 5}O{sub 14}, which causes strain that needs alleviating; squashing the 8/4 cage in NdP{sub 5}O{sub 14} would be the most susceptible option towards this end, since its cage manifests the weakest structural construct. GdP{sub 5}O{sub 14} succumbs to a gradual contraction of its 8/4 cage only with increasing temperature above 300 K; this is well below its second-order monoclinic-to-orthorhombic phase transition at 420–430 K; which is 420 K for NdP{sub 5}O{sub 14}. Fortunately, the volumes of heavy metal ions that arise from spent nuclear fuels do not match the size requirements of cages with 8/4 topology in RP{sub 5}O{sub 14} hosts needed for encapsulation; otherwise, radiation leakage of such containment would present a risk. Both NdP{sub 5}O{sub 14} and GdP{sub 5}O{sub 14} would therefore seem to offer good prospects as host media for nuclear waste storage.","","Available from http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jssc.2018.07.020","","","","Netherlands","2018-10-15T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: Journal of Solid State Chemistry (Print); Journal Volume: 266; Other Information: © 2018 Published by Elsevier Inc.; Country of input: International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA)","","Medium: X; Size: page(s) 250-257","","","","Journal ID: ISSN 0022-4596; CODEN: JSSCBI; PII: S0022459618303049; TRN: US20W8514052759","10.1016/J.JSSC.2018.07.020","","2021-01-07T00:00:00Z","22890241","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/22890241","","Journal of Solid State Chemistry (Print)","","266"

All experiments were performed under Ar atmosphere at T = (22 ± 2)°C. XRD, quantitative chemical analysis, SEM–EDS and TG–DTA confirm that K<sub>2</sub>U<sub>2</sub>O<sub>7</sub>·1.5H<sub>2</sub>O(cr) is the solid phase controlling the solubility in all evaluated systems at pH<sub>m</sub> ≥ 9.5. Below this pH<sub>m</sub> and with decreasing KCl concentration, the formation of sub-stoichiometric phases with K:U < 1 is indicated by XRD and solubility data. The concentration of uranium in equilibrium with K<sub>2</sub>U<sub>2</sub>O<sub>7</sub>·1.5H<sub>2</sub>O(cr) shows a pH-independent behaviour up to pH<sub>m</sub> ≈ 11 regardless of ionic strength, whereas an increase of the solubility with a well–defined slope of +1 (log [U] vs. pH<sub>m</sub>) is observed at pH<sub>m</sub> ≥11. These results are consistent with the predominance of UO<sub>2</sub>(OH)<sub>3</sub><sup>–</sup> and UO<sub>2</sub>(OH)<sub>4</sub><sup>2-</sup> species as previously reported in the literature. The combination of solubility data obtained in the present study with K<sub>2</sub>U<sub>2</sub>O<sub>7</sub>·1.5H<sub>2</sub>O(cr) and the U(VI) hydrolysis scheme reported in Altmaier et al.

This work extends the thermodynamic database available for U(VI) and allows more accurate source term calculations in the context of nuclear waste disposal under boundary conditions where significant K concentrations may be present and redox conditions lie in the stability field of U(VI). Finally, the K<sub>2</sub>U<sub>2</sub>O<sub>7</sub>·1.5H<sub>2</sub>O(cr) solid phase can be considered to control the solubility of U(VI) in the degradation phase I of cement and cementitious materials.","Elsevier","","Los Alamos National Lab.

Detailed characterization of a water filled storage basin for spent nuclear reactor fuel was performed following the formation and proliferation of an amorphous white flocculent. White precipitant was sampled throughout the storage basin for chemical and spectroscopic characterization, and environmental DNA was extracted for 454 pyrosequencing of bacterial 16S rRNA gene diversity. Accordingly, spectroscopic analyses indicated the precipitant to be primarily amorphous to crystalline aluminum (oxy) hydroxides with minor associated elemental components including Fe, Si, Ti, and U. High levels of organic carbon were co-localized with the precipitant relative to bulk dissolved organic concentrations. Bacterial densities were highly variable between sampling locations and with depth within the water filled storage basin; cell numbers ranged from 4 × 10<sup>3</sup>to 4 × 104 cells/mL. Bacterial diversity that was physically associated with the aluminum (oxy) hydroxide complexes exceeded an estimated 4,000 OTUs/amplicon library (3% cutoff) and the majority of sequences were aligned to the families Burkholderiaceae (23%), Nitrospiraceae (23%), Hyphomicrobiaceae (17%), and Comamonadaceae (6%). We surmise that episodic changes in the physical and chemical properties of the basin contribute to the polymerization of aluminum (oxy) hydroxides, which in turn can chemisorb nutrients, carbon ligands and bacterial cells from the surrounding bulk aqueous phase. As such, these precipitants should establish favorable microhabitats for bacterial colonization and growth. Comparative analyses of 16S rRNA gene amplicon libraries across a selection of natural and engineered aquatic ecosystems were performed and microbial community and taxonomic signatures unique to the spent nuclear fuel (SNF) storage basin environment were revealed. These insights could spur the development of tractable bio-indicators that are specific of and diagnostic for water quality at discrete locations and finer scales of resolution, marking an important contribution for improved water quality and management of SNF storage facilities.","Frontiers Research Foundation","","Pacific Northwest National Lab.

Batch studies using simulated low-activity waste indicate that Tc(VII) and Cr(VI) removal is contingent on reduction to Tc(IV) and Cr(III). Furthermore, complete removal of both Cr and Tc depends on the amount of Fe(OH)<sub>2</sub>(s) present, where complete Cr and Tc removal requires more Fe(OH)<sub>2</sub>(s) (&sim;200 g/L of simulant), than removing Cr alone (&sim;50 g/L of simulant). XRD analysis suggests that Fe(OH)<sub>2</sub>(s) reaction and transformation in the simulant produces mostly goethite (α-FeOOH), where Fe(OH)<sub>2</sub>(s) transformation to goethite rather than magnetite is likely due to the simulant chemistry, which includes high levels of nitrite and other constituents. Once reduced, a fraction of Cr(III) and Tc(IV) substitute for octahedral Fe(III) within the goethite crystal lattice as supported by XPS, XANES, and/or EXAFS results. The remaining Cr(III) forms oxide and/or hydroxide phases, whereas Tc(IV) not fully incorporated into goethite persists as either adsorbed or partially incorporated Tc(IV)-oxide species. As such, to fully incorporate Tc(IV) into the goethite crystal structure, additional Fe(OH)<sub>2</sub>(s) (&gt;200 g/L of simulant) may be required.","American Chemical Society (ACS)","","Pacific Northwest National Lab.

As part of an ongoing programme of work to assess NRVB performance, 1-D reactive-transport models have been constructed to simulate reaction with different illustrative groundwater compositions. Variant cases were also produced to explore the effect of model assumptions on the predicted behaviour of the backfill. Depending on groundwater composition, cement alteration pathways included: carbonation; external sulphate attack; chloride attack; the formation of magnesium-rich solids; and the precipitation of secondary aluminosilicate minerals. In general, the models suggest that the pore space in backfill associated with radioactive waste disposal systems is likely to become clogged (to some degree) over time close to backfill-rock interfaces resulting in a reduction in capacity for solute transport. However, the models do not include all relevant process couplings which is potentially, an area for further work.","","Available from http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.cemconres.2018.06.007","","","","United States","2018-09-15T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: Cement and Concrete Research; Journal Volume: 111; Other Information: Copyright (c) 2017 Elsevier Science B.V., Amsterdam, The Netherlands, All rights reserved.; Country of input: International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA)","","Medium: X; Size: page(s) 81-93","","","","Journal ID: ISSN 0008-8846; CODEN: CCNRAI; PII: S0008884617312115; TRN: US19W2958050918","10.1016/J.CEMCONRES.2018.06.007","","2020-10-15T00:00:00Z","22806523","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/22806523","","Cement and Concrete Research","","111"
"Rock-welding materials development for deep borehole nuclear waste disposal","Yang, Pin; Wang, Yifeng; Rodriguez, Mark A.; Brady, Patrick V.","12 MANAGEMENT OF RADIOACTIVE AND NON-RADIOACTIVE WASTES FROM NUCLEAR FACILITIES; Amorphous; Nuclear waste materials; Kinetics","We report that various versions of deep borehole nuclear waste disposal have been proposed in the past in which effective sealing of a borehole after waste emplacement is generally required. In a high temperature disposal mode, the sealing function will be fulfilled by melting the ambient granitic rock with waste decay heat or an external heating source, creating a melt that will encapsulate waste containers or plug a portion of the borehole above a stack of the containers. However, there are certain drawbacks associated with natural materials, such as high melting temperatures, inefficient consolidation, slow crystallization kinetics, the resulting sealing materials generally being porous with low mechanical strength, insufficient adhesion to waste container surface, and lack of flexibility for engineering controls. In this study, we showed that natural granitic materials can be purposefully engineered through chemical modifications to enhance the sealing capability of the materials for deep borehole disposal. The present work systematically explores the effect of chemical modification and crystallinity (amorphous vs. crystalline) on the melting and crystallization processes of a granitic rock system. The approach can be applied to modify granites excavated from different geological sites. Several engineered granitic materials have been explored which possess significantly lower processing and densification temperatures than natural granites. Finally, those new materials consolidate more efficiently by viscous flow and accelerated recrystallization without compromising their mechanical integrity and properties.","Elsevier","","Sandia National Lab.

Nevertheless, the current status of the development of these methods is more limited than it might be expected based on their genuine advantages. The main aim of this paper is to review the automated flow analysis procedures developed with various detection methods for the nuclear energy industry. The flow analysis methods for the determination of radionuclides, that have been reported to date, are primarily focused on their environmental applications. The benefits of the application of flow methods in both monitoring of the nuclear wastes and process analysis of the primary circuit coolants of light water nuclear reactors will also be discussed. The application of either continuous flow methods (CFA) or injection methods (FIA, SIA) of the flow analysis with the β–radiometric detection shortens the analysis time and improves the precision of determination due to mechanization of certain time-consuming operations of the sample processing. Compared to the radiometric detection, the mass spectrometry (MS) detection enables one to perform multicomponent analyses as well as the determination of transuranic isotopes with much better limits of detection.","Elsevier","","Pacific Northwest National Lab.

The environmental risk associated with Tc is due to its long half-life (213,000 years) and high mobility of the oxidized anionic pertechnetate species, Tc(VII)O<sub>4</sub><sup>-</sup>, which warranted the US Department of Energy to identify Tc as a primary contaminant of concern. This risk generates a critical need to resolve scientific and technical issues underpinning the ability to safely, cost-effectively, and efficiently remediate Tc-contaminated vadose zone sediments and groundwater and mitigate risk to human health and the environment. Developing enhanced attenuation and efficient remediation strategies for released Tc requires a complete understanding of retardation processes and Tc mass flux, including the different mechanisms by which Tc is immobilized in the subsurface and the effect of localized subsurface conditions. Selection of over 30 sediments from Hanford waste disposal sites, based on historical information and sediment characterization, for analysis by autoradiography revealed that Tc concentrations were generally below the detection limit of 5 mg Tc/g sediment. When Tc was measurable in vadose zone sediments, it was predominantly present as TcO<sub>4</sub><sup>-</sup> in water films associated with fine-grained sediments, with a maximum of 12 % of the total Tc present in the acid-extractable fraction, defined here as the immobile fraction. However, beneath one waste disposal site, where sediments containing minerals with reducing capacity intercepted miscellaneous fission product recovery waste and waste from the bismuth phosphate process, the amount of Tc present in the immobile fraction was 53 % of the total. Characterization of Tc-containing phases present in these field-contaminated sediments for the first time using Tc K-edge X-ray absorption near edge structure spectroscopy revealed that, as well as Tc present as Tc(VII)O<sub>4</sub><sup>-</sup> in pore water associated with fine-grained sediments, Tc was also: (i) physically encapsulated within solid phases precipitated from other waste components and in multi-component phosphate minerals; and (ii) present as mixed Tc(VII)/Tc(IV) in localized reducing zones. These results will be used to develop improved long-term Tc remediation strategies optimized for field application, through stimulation of conditions that enhance Tc attenuation.","American Chemical Society","","Argonne National Lab.

"The Dissolution Behavior of Borosilicate Glasses in Far-From Equilibrium Conditions","Neeway, James J.; Rieke, Peter C.; Parruzot, Benjamin P.; Ryan, Joseph V.; Asmussen, R. Matthew","12 MANAGEMENT OF RADIOACTIVE AND NON-RADIOACTIVE WASTES FROM NUCLEAR FACILITIES","An area of agreement in the waste glass corrosion community is that, at far-from-equilibrium conditions, the dissolution of borosilicate glasses used to immobilize nuclear waste is known to be a function of both temperature and pH. The aim of this work is to study the effects of temperature and pH on the dissolution rate of three model nuclear waste glasses (SON68, ISG, AFCI). The dissolution rate data are then used to parameterize a kinetic rate model based on Transition State Theory that has been developed to model glass corrosion behavior in dilute conditions. To do this, experiments were conducted at temperatures of 23, 40, 70, and 90 °C and pH(22 °C) values of 9, 10, 11, and 12 with the single-pass flow-through (SPFT) test method. Both the absolute dissolution rates and the rate model parameters are compared with previous results. Rate model parameters for the three glasses studied here are nearly equivalent within error and in relative agreement with previous studies though quantifiable differences exist. The glass dissolution rates were analyzed with a linear multivariate regression (LMR) and a nonlinear multivariate regression performed with the use of the Glass Corrosion Modeling Tool (GCMT), with which a robust uncertainty analysis is performed. This robust analysis highlights the high degree of correlation of various parameters in the kinetic rate model. As more data are obtained on borosilicate glasses with varying compositions, a mathematical description of the effect of glass composition on the rate parameter values should be possible. This would allow for the possibility of calculating the forward dissolution rate of glass based solely on composition. In addition, the method of determination of parameter uncertainty and correlation provides a framework for other rate models that describe the dissolution rates of other amorphous and crystalline materials in a wide range of chemical conditions. As a result, the higher level of uncertainty analysis would provide a basis for comparison of different rate models and allow for a better means of quantifiably comparing the various models.","The Geochemical Society; The Meteoritical Society","","Pacific Northwest National Lab.

Two techniques have been proposed to prevent the migration of buoyant CO<sub>2</sub> from the storage domain by expediting mixing of CO<sub>2</sub> with the brine and mitigate risk of its leakage risk. These two methods are injection of CO<sub>2</sub> pre-mixed with brine, and injection of CO<sub>2</sub> with nanoparticles (NPs). The former has been studied to some extent, however, understanding of the latter is very limited. Unlike the application of NPs in hydrocarbon recovery, its use to enhance safety of CO<sub>2</sub> storage is a fairly unexplored topic that can have important benefits for the safety of the storage process. Also, the use of NPs for subsurface application in general is compromised for its cost.

The waste, stored in underground tanks, was generated via three distinct processes over decades of plutonium extraction operations. Although close records were kept of original waste disposition, tank-to-tank transfers and conditions that impede equilibrium complicate our understanding of the chemistry, phase composition, and rheology of the waste. Tank waste slurries comprise particles and aggregates from nano to micron scales, with varying densities, morphologies, heterogeneous compositions, and complicated responses to flow regimes and process conditions. Further, remnant or changing radiation fields may affect the stability and rheology of the waste. These conditions pose challenges for transport through conduits or pipes to treatment plants for vitrification. Additionally, recalcitrant boehmite degrades glass quality and must be reduced prior to vitrification, but dissolves much more slowly than predicted given surface normalized rates. Existing empirical models based on ex situ experiments and observations lack true predictive capabilities. Recent advances in in situ microscopy, aberration corrected TEM, theoretical modeling across scales, and experimental methods for probing the physics and chemistry at mineral-fluid and mineral-mineral interfaces are being implemented to build robustly predictive physics-based models.","American Chemical Society (ACS)","","Pacific Northwest National Lab.

In this study, uncontaminated Hanford sediments were reacted for 365 days with acidic (pH 3), uranium-bearing waste solutions, with and without phosphate in batch experiments, prior to detailed characterizations using electron microscopy, x-ray diffraction and x-ray absorption spectroscopy. In PO4-reactant free systems, uranium speciation was controlled initially by precipitation of compreignacite [K<sub>2</sub>(UO<sub>2</sub>)<sub>6</sub>O<sub>4</sub>(OH)<sub>6</sub>·8H<sub>2</sub>O]- and becquerelite [Ca(UO<sub>2</sub>)<sub>6</sub>O<sub>4</sub>(OH)<sub>6</sub>·8H<sub>2</sub>O]-like species.

When present, PO<sub>4</sub> exerted a direct and strong control over U speciation. The detection of meta-ankoleite, [K<sub>2</sub>(UO<sub>2</sub>)<sub>2</sub>O<sub>4</sub>(PO<sub>4</sub>)<sub>2</sub>·6H<sub>2</sub>O] at all reaction times when U was present emphasizes the importance of dissolved phosphate as a control on U speciation. Here, meta-ankoleite appears well crystallized and when it occurs as the principal product of sediment weathering, its low solubility is expected to limit dissolved U(VI) concentrations in groundwater. Although boltwoodite solubility is also low, it is formed more slowly (and only when PO<sub>4</sub> is absent), after initial precipitation of more soluble, less crystalline uranyl hydroxides. In the context of Hanford crib waste our results suggest that with PO<sub>4</sub> present, nearly all uranium would have precipitated in the upper soil.","Elsevier","","Pacific Northwest National Lab.

Testing of the pilot-scale, joule-heated DuraMelter 1200 at the Vitreous State Laboratory has shown that bubbling increases the melt rate, and as a result, melter throughput. Computational fluid dynamics (CFD) models of this pilot-scale waste glass melter were developed to improve our understanding of the processes that occur within the melter to aid in process optimization and troubleshooting of the Vit Plant melters. Unfortunately, model validation is complicated by the difficulty of obtaining suitable experimental data for operational melters attributed to the large-scale, radioactivity and high temperatures at which these melters are operated. This study focuses on confirming the fidelity of the CFD models to accurately reproduce the bubbling behavior. Because of the paucity of experimental data at the resolution required for CFD validation, a code-to-code comparison was used to evaluate two common approaches for simulating flows of immiscible fluids on numerical grids and resolving multiphase interfaces. Here, the volume of fluid and level set methods are used to track the dynamically evolving interfaces between the molten glass and the air bubbles. To aid in the verification of the results of these codes, a comparison of the bubble behavior, growth, and frequency of bubble generation are presented and a grid convergence study is performed for the two approaches. In addition to comparing the numerical results to available experimental data and observations from pilot-scale testing, the results are evaluated in relation to laboratory experiments with bubbles injected into viscous fluids, empirical correlations obtained from the published literature, and the basic laws of fluid dynamics. Furthermore, the results of this work can assist in validating waste glass melter models and provide a better understanding of the flow patterns within the WTP melters.","Elsevier","","Idaho National Lab.

"Development of Neutron Energy Spectral Signatures for Passive Monitoring of Spent Nuclear Fuels in Dry Cask Storage","Harkness, Ira; Zhu, Ting; Liang, Yinong; Rauch, Eric; Enqvist, Andreas; Jordan, Kelly A.","12 MANAGEMENT OF RADIOACTIVE AND NON-RADIOACTIVE WASTES FROM NUCLEAR FACILITIES; spent fuel; safeguards; neutron measurement","Demand for spent nuclear fuel dry casks as an interim storage solution has increased globally and the IAEA has expressed a need for robust safeguards and verification technologies for ensuring the continuity of knowledge and the integrity of radioactive materials inside spent fuel casks. Existing research has been focusing on “fingerprinting” casks based on count rate statistics to represent radiation emission signatures. The current research aims to expand to include neutron energy spectral information as part of the fuel characteristics. First, spent fuel composition data are taken from the Next Generation Safeguards Initiative Spent Fuel Libraries, representative for Westinghouse 17<sup>x</sup>17 PWR assemblies. The ORIGEN-S code then calculates the spontaneous fission and (α,n) emissions for individual fuel rods, followed by detailed MCNP simulations of neutrons transported through the fuel assemblies. A comprehensive database of neutron energy spectral profiles is to be constructed, with different enrichment, burn-up, and cooling time conditions. The end goal is to utilize the computational spent fuel library, predictive algorithm, and a pressurized <sup>4</sup>He scintillator to verify the spent fuel assemblies inside a cask. This work identifies neutron spectral signatures that correlate with the cooling time of spent fuel. Both the total and relative contributions from spontaneous fission and (α,n) change noticeably with respect to cooling time, due to the relatively short half-life (18 years) of the major neutron source <sup>244</sup>Cm. Identification of this and other neutron spectral signatures allows the characterization of spent nuclear fuels in dry cask storage.","EDP Sciences","","Los Alamos National Lab.

There are various research efforts being pursued to develop technologies that can be implemented for cost effective management of Tc, including studies to understand the behavior of Tc during vitrification, with the goal of eventually increasing Tc retention in glass. Furthermore, one of these studies has focused on identifying the form or species of Tc and Re (surrogate for Tc) that evolve during the waste-to-glass conversion process. This information is important for understanding the mechanism of Tc volatilization. In this paper, available information collected from the literature is critically evaluated to clarify the volatile species of Tc and Re and, more specifically, whether they volatilize as alkali pertechnetate and perrhenate or as technetium and rhenium oxides after decomposition of alkali pertechnetate and perrhenate. The evaluated data ranged from mass spectrometric identification of species volatilized from pure and binary alkali pertechnetate and perrhenate salts to structural and chemical analyses of volatilized materials during crucible melting and scaled melter processing of simulated wastes.","Elsevier","","Pacific Northwest National Lab.

"Coupled THMC models for bentonite in an argillite repository for nuclear waste: Illitization and its effect on swelling stress under high temperature","Zheng, Liange; Rutqvist, Jonny; Xu, Hao; Birkholzer, Jens T.","12 MANAGEMENT OF RADIOACTIVE AND NON-RADIOACTIVE WASTES FROM NUCLEAR FACILITIES","Subsurface manipulations such as those expected from the disposal of heat-emanating radioactive waste in deep repositories can induce strongly coupled Thermal (T), hydrological (H), mechanical (M) and chemical (C) processes. Adequate coupled THMC models are highly desirable or even indispensable for performance assessment of such repositories, for examples for the analysis of bentonite-based engineered barrier system (EBS) surrounding the emplaced waste. In this study, we present coupled THMC model simulations of a generic nuclear waste repository in an argillite with a bentonite-based buffer. The objective is to evaluate the chemical changes in the EBS bentonite and their effect on mechanical behavior under high temperature, attempting to shed light on whether EBS bentonite can sustain temperatures higher than 100 °C without significant impact on barrier's performance. Two scenarios were simulated for comparison: a case in which the temperature near the waste canister peaks at 200 °C and a case in which the temperature at the same spot culminate with about 100 °C. Simulations for a generic case with Kunigel-VI bentonite as backfill and Opalinus Clay as host rock were conducted for 1000 years and reported in the previous study (Zheng et al., 2015). In this paper, simulations for 100,000 years have been done for two types of bentonite-based buffer materials: Kunigel-VI and FEBEX bentonite. This enables us to evaluate how different types of bentonite behave in terms of the illitization and its impact on swelling stress and whether we can generalize these results to support decision making. The simulations show the occurrence of illitization in the bentonite buffer and the enhancement of illitization under high temperature. However, FEBEX bentonite undergoes less illitization mainly due to the higher ion concentration in pore water and the lower content of K-feldspar in the bentonite mineral composition. Moreover, the reduction of swelling stress by chemical changes is more pronounced for Kunigel-VI bentonite than for FEBEX bentonite. Furthermore, the results of our model simulations suggest that an argillite repository with a bentonite-based EBS that is similar to FEBEX bentonite could sustain temperatures much higher than 100 °C as far as illitization concerns. Model results also reveal that illitization is stabilized after about 2000 years in bentonite near the waste package, but continues in bentonite near the bentonite-argillite interface, which manifests the strong effect of geochemical interaction between EBS bentonite and host rock on long term illitization in bentonite.","Elsevier","","Lawrence Berkeley National Lab.

One such example is the certification of the Hanford Waste Treatment Plant, where radioactive and toxic chemical waste that spontaneously generates flammable gases is stored in large tanks. We introduce the QMU methodology to quantify the system safety of waste storage tanks in the event of a loss of tank ventilation, which poses a safety risk to workers. We also show how QMU can be used as a design tool to find operating regimes that maintain a desired confidence level. A simplified physical model is used to analyze the build-up of hydrogen gas in storage tanks and conduct an uncertainty propagation study to quantify the operating margin with respect to the flammability conditions. A demonstration problem is shown in which the radiation loading in a waste tank is iteratively modified until a desired confidence ratio is achieved. The results show that the resulting designs are sensitive to the use of interval or full QMU to achieve a confidence ratio, and it is not always possible to realize a design at a particular confidence ratio.","Elsevier","","Stanford Univ., CA (United States)","USDOE National Nuclear Security Administration (NNSA)","","United States","2017-09-28T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: Nuclear Engineering and Design; Journal Volume: 324","","Medium: ED; Size: p. 379-389","","","NA0002373","Journal ID: ISSN 0029-5493; PII: S0029549317304570","10.1016/j.nucengdes.2017.09.016","","2022-01-19T00:00:00Z","1538670","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/1538670","https://www.osti.gov/servlets/purl/1538670","Nuclear Engineering and Design","","324"

Additionally, the FBR is heated to 650 °C and the aqueous reactant is spray-atomized into the fluidized bed, converting it into a granular solid through a series of heterogeneous chemical reactions. The objective of this study is to use the MFiX two-fluid model as a screening tool to investigate the effects of off-nominal conditions for the purpose of establishing performance guidelines. This information will be helpful to assess whether the identified boundaries of the system are steep or gradual. Initially, 13 independent operating parameters were sampled in a one-at-a-time manner using high, low, and base values and ranked against a set of performance criteria. Five operating parameters were found to have the largest effect (bed particle size, bed particle density, coal particle size, spray feed flow rate, and fluidizing gas flow rate) on three quantities of interest—bed differential temperature, solids velocity, and bed voidage. Latin hypercube sampling was used to generate a minimal number of random values for various combinations of input parameters. The spray feed flow rate was the most significant parameter for the temperature differences, and the coal particle and bed particle size were significant contributors. The bed particle size had the largest effect on the low velocity of the bed particles, with the coal particle size as a contributing second effect. The high solid packing shows the coal particle size with the largest effect, and significant secondary contributions from the feed flow rate and fluidizing gas flow rate. Finally, the fits to the five-dimensional Gaussian Process models were 0.7797, 0.8664, and 0.9440 for the temperature, velocity, and solids packing respectively.","Elsevier","","Idaho National Lab.

The resource impact of producing wasted food is substantial; however, little is known about the energy and water consumed in managing food waste after it has been disposed. Herein, we characterize food waste within the Food-Energy-Water (FEW) nexus and parse the differential FEW effects of producing uneaten food and managing food loss and waste. We find that various food waste management options, such as waste prevention, landfilling, composting, anaerobic digestion, and incineration, present variable pathways for FEW impacts and opportunities. Furthermore, comprehensive sustainable management of food waste will involve varied mechanisms and actors at multiple levels of governance and at the level of individual consumers. To address the complex food waste problem, we therefore propose a “food-waste-systems” approach to optimize resources within the FEW nexus. Such a framework may be applied to devise strategies that, for instance, minimize the amount of edible food that is wasted, foster efficient use of energy and water in the food production process, and simultaneously reduce pollution externalities and create opportunities from recycled energy and nutrients. Characterization of FEW nexus impacts of wasted food, including descriptions of dynamic feedback behaviors, presents a significant research gap and a priority for future work. Large-scale decision making requires more complete understanding of food waste and its management within the FEW nexus, particularly regarding post-disposal impacts related to water.","","Available from http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.wasman.2018.01.014","","","","United States","2018-04-15T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: Waste Management; Journal Volume: 74; Other Information: Copyright (c) 2017 Elsevier Science B.V., Amsterdam, The Netherlands, All rights reserved.; Country of input: International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA)","","Medium: X; Size: page(s) 52-62","","","","Journal ID: ISSN 0956-053X; CODEN: WAMAE2; PII: S0956053X18300151; TRN: US19V3663002735","10.1016/J.WASMAN.2018.01.014","","2020-11-18T00:00:00Z","22841177","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/22841177","","Waste Management","","74"

During road or rail transportation, SNF will experience unique conditions that could affect the structural integrity of the cladding due to vibrational and impact loading. Lack of SNF inertia-induced dynamic fatigue data, especially for the high burn-up (HBU) SNF systems, has brought significant challenges to quantify the reliability of SNF during transportation with a high degree of confidence. To address this shortcoming, Oak Ridge National Laboratory (ORNL) developed a SNF vibration testing protocol without fuel pellets removal, which has provided significant insight regarding the dynamics of mechanical interactions between pellet and cladding. This research has provided a detailed understanding about the effect of loading rate and loading mode on the fatigue damage evolution of HBU SNF under normal conditions of transport (NCT). Static and dynamic loading experimental data were generated for SNF under simulated transportation environments using a cyclic integrated reversible-bending fatigue tester (CIRFT), an enabling hot-cell testing technology developed at ORNL. SNF flexural tensile strength and fatigue S-N data from pressurized water reactors (PWRs) and boiling water reactor (BWR) HBU SNF are presented in this paper, including the potential effects of pellet-cladding interface bonding, hydride reorientation, and thermal annealing to SNF vibration reliability. The data presented here can be used to meet the nuclear industry and U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission needs in safety of SNF transportation operations.","Elsevier","","Oak Ridge National Lab.

We report here a general approach to overcome this challenge by creating radioactive organic iodide molecular traps through functionalization of metal-organic framework materials with tertiary amine-binding sites. The molecular trap exhibits a high CH<sub>3</sub>I saturation uptake capacity of 71 wt% at 150 °C, which is more than 340% higher than the industrial adsorbent Ag<sup>0</sup>@MOR under identical conditions. These functionalized metal-organic frameworks also serve as good adsorbents at low temperatures. Furthermore, the resulting adsorbent can be recycled multiple times without loss of capacity, making recyclability a reality. In combination with its chemical and thermal stability, high capture efficiency and low cost, the adsorbent demonstrates promise for industrial radioactive organic iodides capture from nuclear waste. The capture mechanism was investigated by experimental and theoretical methods.","Nature Publishing Group","","Univ. of Texas at Dallas, Richardson, TX (United States)","USDOE Office of Science (SC), Basic Energy Sciences (BES)","","United States","2017-09-07T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: Nature Communications; Journal Volume: 8; Journal Issue: 1","","Medium: ED; Size: Article No. 485","","","FG02-08ER46491","Journal ID: ISSN 2041-1723; PII: 526","10.1038/s41467-017-00526-3","","2021-10-27T00:00:00Z","1535103","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/1535103","https://www.osti.gov/servlets/purl/1535103","Nature Communications","1","8"
"Micromechanical processes in consolidated granular salt","Mills, Melissa Marie; Stormont, John C.; Bauer, Stephen J.","12 MANAGEMENT OF RADIOACTIVE AND NON-RADIOACTIVE WASTES FROM NUCLEAR FACILITIES; granular salt consolidation; deformation mechanism; microstructural investigations; geologic nuclear waste repository applications","Here, granular salt is likely to be used as backfill material and a seal system component within geologic salt formations serving as a repository for long-term isolation of nuclear waste. Pressure from closure of the surrounding salt formation will promote consolidation of granular salt, eventually resulting in properties comparable to native salt. Understanding dependence of consolidation processes on stress state, moisture availability, temperature, and time is important for demonstrating sealing functions and long-term repository performance. This study characterizes laboratory-consolidated granular salt by means of microstructural observations. Granular salt material from mining operations was obtained from the bedded Salado Formation hosting the Waste Isolation Pilot Plant and the Avery Island salt dome. Laboratory test conditions included hydrostatic consolidation of jacketed granular salt with varying conditions of confining isochoric stress to 38 MPa, temperature to 250 °C, moisture additions of 1% by weight, time duration, and vented and non-vented states. Resultant porosities ranged between 1% and 22%. Optical and scanning electron microscopic techniques were used to ascertain consolidation mechanisms. From these investigations, samples with 1% added moisture or unvented during consolidation, exhibit clear pressure solution processes with tightly cohered grain boundaries and occluded fluid pores. Samples with only natural moisture content consolidated by a combination of brittle, cataclastic, and crystal plastic deformation. Recrystallization at 250 °C irrespective of moisture conditions was also observed. The range and variability of conditions applied in this study, combined with the techniques used to display microstructural features, are unique, and provide insight into an important area of governing deformation mechanism(s) occurring within salt repository applications.","Elsevier","","Sandia National Lab.

These crystals do not affect glass durability; however, if accumulated in thick layers, they can clog the melter and prevent discharge of molten glass into canisters. To address this problem, an empirical model was developed that can predict thicknesses of accumulated layers as a function of glass composition. This model predicts well the accumulation of single crystals and/or small-scale agglomerates, but excessive agglomeration observed in high-Ni-Fe glass resulted in an underprediction of accumulated layers, which gradually worsened over time as an increased number of agglomerates formed. In conclusion, the accumulation rate of ~53.8 ± 3.7 μm/h determined for this glass will result in a ~26 mm-thick layer after 20 days of melter idling.","Elsevier","","Pacific Northwest National Lab.

Additionally, they overlie crystalline rocks hosting nuclear waste repositories in rift settings. The permeability characteristics of an arenaceous fluvial succession, the Triassic St Bees Sandstone Formation in England (UK), are described, from core-plug to well-test scale up to ~1 km depth. Within such lithified successions, dissolution associated with the circulation of meteoric water results in increased permeability (K~10{sup −1}–10{sup 0} m/day) to depths of at least 150 m below ground level (BGL) in aquifer systems that are subject to rapid groundwater circulation. Thus, contaminant transport is likely to occur at relatively high rates. In a deeper investigation (> 150 m depth), where the aquifer has not been subjected to rapid groundwater circulation, well-test-scale hydraulic conductivity is lower, decreasing from K~10{sup −2} m/day at 150–400 m BGL to 10{sup −3} m/day down-dip at ~1 km BGL, where the pore fluid is hypersaline. Here, pore-scale permeability becomes progressively dominant with increasing lithostatic load. Notably, this work investigates a sandstone aquifer of fluvial origin at investigation depths consistent with highly enthalpy geothermal reservoirs (~0.7–1.1 km). At such depths, intergranular flow dominates in unfaulted areas with only minor contribution by bedding plane fractures. However, extensional faults represent preferential flow pathways, due to presence of high connective open fractures. Therefore, such faults may (1) drive nuclear waste contaminants towards the highly permeable shallow (< 150 m BGL) zone of the aquifer, and (2) influence fluid recovery in geothermal fields.","","","","","","United States","2018-03-15T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: Hydrogeology Journal; Journal Volume: 26; Journal Issue: 2; Other Information: Copyright (c) 2018 Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature; Article Copyright (c) 2017 The Author(s); Country of input: International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA)","","Medium: X; Size: page(s) 565-591","","","","Journal ID: ISSN 1431-2174; TRN: US19K6000024150","10.1007/S10040-017-1676-Z","","2019-04-26T00:00:00Z","22780880","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/22780880","","Hydrogeology Journal","2","26"

Nuclear fuel data, transportation package model templates, and SNF canister loading map information residing within the tool facilitate automated generation of SCALE input files for radiation source term and dose rate calculations. Transportation package specific models developed for UNF-ST&DARDS dose rate analyses are described in detail. UNF-ST&DARDS dose rate analyses were performed in this paper for over 400 SNF canisters from 16 sites in their designated transportation casks. For simplicity, representative dose rate calculation results are presented as a function of time (i.e., selected calendar years between 2020 and 2100) for 73 SNF canisters in dry storage at four sites. For these canisters, the projected maximum dose rate values at 2 m from the lateral surfaces of the vehicle under normal conditions of transport (NCT) would vary between 1.9 and 11.5 mrem/h in 2020. Five SNF canisters will exceed the regulatory dose rate limit of 10 mrem/h at 2 m in 2020, and the analyzed SNF canisters will comply with regulatory dose rate limits by 2030. An analysis of the impact on the dose rate of fuel failure and reconfiguration during transportation indicated that the maximum dose rate for hypothetical accident conditions will be unaffected, and the NCT maximum dose rate at 2 m would have a maximum increase by a factor of 1.7 for a representative pressurized water reactor package and by a factor of 2.6 for a representative boiling water reactor package relative to intact fuel. Finally, analysis of the actual heat loading and the dose rate at 2 m from the lateral surface of the vehicle for the five SNF canisters exceeding the NCT regulatory dose rate limit of 10 mrem/h in 2020 showed that the dose rate could be more limiting with respect to regulatory requirements than the heat loading; i.e., the canister transportability date may be evaluated based on the transportation package’s external dose rate.","Taylor & Francis - formerly American Nuclear Society (ANS)","","Oak Ridge National Lab.

These analyses require the use of assorted tools and numerous types of data. Using the appropriate modeling and simulation (M&S) parameters and selecting from the diversity of analytic tools to conduct SNF analyses can be a tedious, error-prone, and time-consuming undertaking for analysts and reviewers alike. A new, integrated data and analysis system was designed to simplify and automate performance of accurate, efficient evaluations for characterizing the input to the overall U.S. nuclear waste management system—the UNF-Storage, Transportation & Disposal Analysis Resource and Data System (UNF-ST&DARDS). A relational database has been assembled to provide a standard means by which UNF-ST&DARDS can succinctly store and retrieve M&S parameters for specific SNF analysis. A library of various analysis model templates is used to communicate M&S parameters for the most appropriate M&S application. A process manager facilitates performance of actual as-loaded, assembly-specific, and cask-specific evaluations. Interactive visualization capabilities facilitate data analysis and results interpretation. To date, UNF-ST&DARDS has completed (1) explicit depletion and decay analysis of every fuel assembly (~245 000) discharged from commercial U.S. reactors through June 2013, with 13 cooling time steps (results include isotopic compositions for 142 isotopes, and radiation and thermal source terms); (2) SNF radiation dose rate evaluations at 1 m for all the fuel assemblies discharged through June 2013; and (3) criticality, shielding, thermal, and containment analyses of hundreds of loaded casks.

Both projects target the Columbia River Basalt (CRB). The new publicity for the old project comes at a time when the approach to high-level nuclear waste disposal has undergone fundamental changes. The emphasis now is on a technical barrier that is chemically compatible with the host rock. In the ideal case, the waste container is in thermodynamic equilibrium with the host-rock groundwater regime. The CRB groundwater has what it takes to represent the ideal case.","","","","","","United States","2018-02-15T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: Hydrogeology Journal; Journal Volume: 26; Journal Issue: 1; Other Information: Copyright (c) 2018 Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature; Article Copyright (c) 2017 The Author(s); Country of input: International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA)","","Medium: X; Size: page(s) 3-6","","","","Journal ID: ISSN 1431-2174; TRN: US19K6544024165","10.1007/S10040-017-1632-Y","","2019-04-26T00:00:00Z","22780895","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/22780895","","Hydrogeology Journal","1","26"
"Analysis of Krypton-85 Legacy Waste Forms: Part I","Bruffey, Stephanie H.; Jubin, Robert Thomas","12 MANAGEMENT OF RADIOACTIVE AND NON-RADIOACTIVE WASTES FROM NUCLEAR FACILITIES; Krypton-85; waste form; corrosion","In 2010, five samples were reclaimed at the Idaho National Laboratory (INL). These samples were generated by R&D performed in the 1970’s relating to the long-term storage of <sup>85</sup>Kr and presented a unique opportunity to study a potential <sup>85</sup>Kr waste form after over three half-lives have elapsed. The container material of two of the reclaimed <sup>85</sup>Kr legacy waste form samples was examined by optical microscopy and by SEM-EDS. Substantial corrosion was observed throughout each sample container. The bulk of the container material was identified as carbon steel, while stainless steel was identified as the weld material used in container manufacture and/or sealing. The material used for Kr encapsulation was found adhered to the walls of each container and had a chemical composition consistent with zeolite minerals. Kr was found coincident with the adhered material, demonstrating that the encapsulation method used in the original experiments was effective in the long-term retention of Kr. In conclusion, the sectioning, mounting, and initial analysis of these legacy samples is an important step in the study of all five legacy <sup>85</sup>Kr waste forms and the information gained from the analysis of Samples 2 and 5 will be used to guide future efforts on these remaining samples.","Taylor & Francis - formerly American Nuclear Society (ANS)","","Oak Ridge National Lab.

Alteration products are formed at the surface of glasses after reaction with solution. In this study, glass altered in the presence of Fe<sup>0</sup> in aqueous solution formed two alteration layers: one embedded with Fe closer to the surface and one without Fe found deeper in the sample. Both layers were found to be thinner than the alteration layer found in glass altered in aqueous solution only. For the first time, Doppler Broadening Positron Annihilation Spectroscopy (DB-PAS) is used to non-destructively characterize the pore structures of glass altered in the presence of Fe<sup>0</sup>. Advantages and disadvantages of DB-PAS compared to other techniques used to analyze pore structures for altered glass samples are discussed. Ultimately, DB-PAS has shown to be an excellent choice for pore structure characterization for glasses with multiple alteration layers. Monte Carlo modeling predicted positron trajectories through the layers, and helped explain DB-PAS data, which showed that the deeper alteration layer without Fe had a similar composition and pore structure to layers on glass altered in water only.","Elsevier","","Pacific Northwest National Lab.

Their production requires the use of a photoinitiator (PI), such as Darocur 1173 (2-hydroxy-2-methyl-1-phenyl-propan-1-one). Even if PI represents a minor part of the formulation, residual amounts may remain in the polymerized products and possibly migrate into the environment during the use of the end products and/or at their end-of-life stage. To assess its possible fate under different environmental conditions, the release of Darocur 1173 from photocrosslinked silicone acrylates and its biodegradation were investigated. Leaching tests in water were conducted on thick coating and thin coated plastic films. Results showed that approximately 90% of the amount of Darocur 1173 used to synthesize thick coatings was released within 8 days of experiment. Biodegration assays were also done to assess the biodegradation of silicone coatings and PI under experimental conditions simulating the products’ end-of-life in sewage treatment plants (aerobic conditions) or in domestic waste landfills (anaerobic conditions). Results showed no biodegradation of thick coatings and PI under anaerobic conditions. An inhibitory effect was even observed on the biodegradation of glucose used as a reference biodegradable molecule. Under aerobic conditions however, PI was totally biodegraded and used as a carbon source, unlike the silicone coating which was not biodegraded.","","","","","","United States","2018-01-15T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: Journal of Polymers and the Environment; Journal Volume: 26; Journal Issue: 1; Other Information: Copyright (c) 2018 Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature; Article Copyright (c) 2017 The Author(s); http://www.springer-ny.com; Country of input: International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA)","","Medium: X; Size: page(s) 244-253","","","","Journal ID: ISSN 1566-2543; TRN: US19K6363031936","10.1007/S10924-017-0939-Z","","2020-09-25T00:00:00Z","22788305","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/22788305","","Journal of Polymers and the Environment","1","26"

It was observed that water vapor affects the degradation of the glass when vitrified wastes are placed in temporary repositories. It is shown that as a result of the degradation the rate of leaching of the glass in water increases significantly.

However, this technique is characterised by long testing times (from 20 to >100 days), which is not suitable for waste utilities, consulting companies or plants operators whose decision-making processes cannot be held for such a long time. This study develops a statistically robust mathematical strategy using sensitivity functions for early prediction of BMP first-order model parameters, i.e. methane yield (B{sub 0}) and kinetic constant rate (k). The minimum testing time for early parameter estimation showed a potential correlation with the k value, where (i) slowly biodegradable substrates (k ≤ 0.1 d{sup −1}) have a minimum testing times of ≥15 days, (ii) moderately biodegradable substrates (0.1 −1</sup>) have a minimum testing times between 8 and 15 days, and (iii) rapidly biodegradable substrates (k ≥ 0.2 d{sup −1}) have testing times lower than 7 days.","","Available from http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.wasman.2017.10.009","","","","United States","2018-01-15T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: Waste Management; Journal Volume: 71; Other Information: Copyright (c) 2017 Elsevier Science B.V., Amsterdam, The Netherlands, All rights reserved.; Country of input: International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA)","","Medium: X; Size: page(s) 19-24","","","","Journal ID: ISSN 0956-053X; CODEN: WAMAE2; PII: S0956053X17307559; TRN: US19V3501002715","10.1016/J.WASMAN.2017.10.009","","2020-11-18T00:00:00Z","22841157","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/22841157","","Waste Management","","71"

To investigate the mechanical behavior of cladding during an RIA, we developed a mechanical pulse-controlled modified burst test instrument that simulates transient events with a pulse width from 10 to 300 ms. This paper includes validation tests of unirradiated and prehydrided ZIRLO cladding tubes. A ZIRLO cladding sample with a hydrogen content of 168 wt. ppm showed ductile behavior and failed at the maximum limits of the test setup with hoop strain to failure greater than 9.2%. ZIRLO samples showed high resistance to failure even at very high hydrogen contents (1,466 wt. ppm). When the hydrogen content was increased to 1,554 wt. ppm, brittle-like behavior was observed at a hoop strain of 2.5%. Preliminary scoping tests at room temperature with FeCrAl tubes were conducted to imitate the pulse behavior of transient test reactors during integral tests. The preliminary FeCrAl tests are informative from the perspective of characterizing the test rig and supporting the design of integral tests for current and potentially accident tolerant cladding materials.","Elsevier","","Oak Ridge National Lab.

The thermal stability of this mineral is a key knowledge in evaluating the integrity of a salt repository in the long term, as water may release due to thermal decomposition of polyhalite. Previous studies on structural evolution of polyhalite at elevated temperatures laid the basis for detailed calorimetric measurements. Using high-temperature oxide-melt drop-solution calorimetry at 975 K with sodium molybdate as the solvent, we have determined the standard enthalpies of formation from constituent sulfates (ΔH°<sub>f,sul</sub>), oxides (ΔH°<sub>f,ox</sub>) and elements (ΔH°<sub>f,ele</sub>) of a polyhalite sample with the composition of K<sub>2</sub>Ca<sub>2</sub>Mg(SO<sub>4</sub>)<sub>4</sub>·1.95H<sub>2</sub>O from the Salado formation at the WIPP site. The obtained results are: ΔH°<sub>f,sul</sub> = -152.5 ± 5.3 kJ/mol, ΔH°<sub>f,ox</sub> = -1926.1 ± 10.5 kJ/mol, and ΔH°<sub>f,ele</sub> = -6301.2 ± 9.9 kJ/mol. Furthermore, based on the estimated formation entropies of polyhalite, its standard Gibbs free energy of formation has been derived to be in the range of -5715.3 ± 9.9 kJ/mol to -5739.3 ± 9.9 kJ/mol. In conclusion, these determined thermodynamic properties provide fundamental parameters for modeling the stability behavior of polyhalite in salt repositories.","Elsevier","","Los Alamos National Lab.

The allowable leakage rate is calculated with the procedures provided in ANSI N14.5-2014 and NUREG/CR-6487, which were adapted for containment analysis of a transportation package containing fuel assemblies with different nuclear characteristics (e.g., initial enrichment, burnup, and cooling time) and clad integrity (intact or damaged). UNF-ST&DARDS applies different source term calculation methodologies for low-burnup fuel (LBF) (i.e., <45 GWd/tonne U) assemblies and high-burnup fuel (HBF) (i.e., ≥45 GWd/tonne U) assemblies. The LBF radionuclide activities are based on actual fuel assembly burnup, initial enrichment, and cooling time. Bounding radionuclide activities based on a fuel pellet burnup value of 65 GWd/tonne U and actual fuel assembly cooling time are used for HBF assemblies. The fraction of failed fuel rods and the release fractions for the contributors to releasable source terms recommended in NUREG-1617 are used in the containment analysis regardless of fuel assembly burnup. However, UNF-ST&DARDS supports different parameter values for LBF and HBF assemblies. Finally, the containment analysis methodology for as-loaded transportation packages is presented in detail, and the UNF-ST&DARDS containment analysis capability is illustrated with results for simulated transportation packages containing spent nuclear fuel canisters in dry storage at selected sites.","Taylor & Francis - formerly American Nuclear Society (ANS)","","Oak Ridge National Lab.

"As-Loaded Criticality Margin Assessment of Dual-Purpose Canisters Using UNF-ST&DARDS","Clarity, J. B.; Banerjee, K.; Liljenfeldt, H. K.; Marshall, W. J.","12 MANAGEMENT OF RADIOACTIVE AND NON-RADIOACTIVE WASTES FROM NUCLEAR FACILITIES; criticality margin; spent nuclear fuel; UNF-ST&DARDS","A novel assessment has been completed in this paper to determine the previously unquantified and uncredited criticality margin available in as-loaded commercial spent nuclear fuel (SNF) canisters. This assessment was performed as part of a broader effort to assess issues and uncertainties with storage, subsequent transportation, and final disposal of SNF canister systems. Detailed analyses crediting the burnup, initial enrichment, and postirradiation cooling time of actual SNF inventory were performed for 554 SNF canisters stored at 23 commercial reactor sites to determine realistic criticality safety margins. These detailed analyses were automated by the Used Nuclear Fuel-Storage, Transportation & Disposal Analysis Resource and Data System (UNF-ST&DARDS), a comprehensive, integrated data and analysis tool. Calculated, uncredited criticality margins (Δk<sub>eff</sub>) with respect to the safety analysis results range from 0 to almost 0.30 Δk<sub>eff</sub> for normal storage and transportation cases. Calculated eigenvalues (k<sub>eff</sub>) range from 0.72 to 1.11 assuming a degraded neutron absorber disposal condition, and they range from 0.94 to 1.20 assuming a degraded basket disposal condition. Calculations with NaCl present in the moderator (which is possible for certain disposal geologies) were used to demonstrate the possibility for subcriticality for degraded cases with a k<sub>eff</sub> above 0.98 with freshwater. The methods used to calculate k<sub>eff</sub> for the canisters analyzed in this work are discussed in detail. The results demonstrate that, for the majority of canisters analyzed here, significant uncredited safety margin is available that could be used to compensate for uncertainties in the SNF assembly and canister internal components. These uncertainties are associated with long-term storage and subsequent transportation and disposal. Results also suggest that the inherent margins associated with how canisters are loaded could support future changes in licensing SNF storage and transportation systems to directly or indirectly credit the margins associated with actual SNF characteristics. Finally, ongoing research continues to gather additional data to quantify uncredited safety margins for SNF canisters loaded at other nuclear reactor sites and to explore potential methods for applying this uncredited margin.","Taylor & Francis - formerly American Nuclear Society (ANS)","","Oak Ridge National Lab.

In the United States, the Nuclear Regulatory Commission (NRC) ordered a “top-to-bottom” review of its regulations, and ultimately approved a number of safety upgrades. It rejected other risk-reduction measures, however, using a screening process that did not adequately account for impacts of large-scale land contamination events.

To help alleviate the damage done to the natural world, the encapsulation of small molecules or ions (guests) into porous inorganic structural frameworks (hosts) provides a potential remedy for some of the environmental concerns facing us today. These concerns include the removal of harmful pollutants from water or air, the safe entrapment of nuclear waste materials, or the purification and storage of small molecules that act as alternative fuel sources. For this study, we review the trends in using inorganic materials as hostmedia for the removal or storage of various wastes and alternative fuels. In conclusion, we cover the treatment of water contaminated with dyes or heavy metals, air pollution alleviation via CO<sub>2</sub>, SO<sub>x</sub>, NO<sub>x</sub>, and volatile organic compound containment, nuclear waste immobilization, and storage for H<sub>2</sub> and methane as alternative fuels.","Royal Society of Chemistry","","Argonne National Lab.

"Conversion of a wet waste feedstock to biocrude by hydrothermal processing in a continuous-flow reactor: grape pomace","Elliott, Douglas C.; Schmidt, Andrew J.; Hart, Todd R.; Billing, Justin M.","12 MANAGEMENT OF RADIOACTIVE AND NON-RADIOACTIVE WASTES FROM NUCLEAR FACILITIES; hydrothermal liquefaction; catalyst; gasification; aqueous phase; grape pomace","Wet waste feedstocks present an apt opportunity for biomass conversion to fuels by hydrothermal processing. In this study, grape pomace slurries from two varieties, Montepulciano and cabernet sauvignon, have been converted into a biocrude by hydrothermal liquefaction (HTL) in a bench-scale, continuous-flow reactor system. Carbon conversion to gravity-separable biocrude product up to 56 % was accomplished at relatively low temperature (350 C) in a pressurized (sub-critical liquid water) environment (20 MPa) when using grape pomace feedstock slurry with a 16.8 wt% concentration of dry solids processed at a liquid hourly space velocity of 2.1 h-1. Direct oil recovery was achieved without the use of a solvent and biomass trace mineral components were removed by processing steps so that they did not cause processing difficulties. In addition, catalytic hydrothermal gasification (CHG) was effectively applied for HTL byproduct water cleanup using a Ru on C catalyst in a fixed bed producing a gas composed of methane and carbon dioxide from water soluble organics. Conversion of 99.8% of the chemical oxygen demand (COD) left in the aqueous phase was demonstrated. As a result, high conversion of grape pomace to liquid and gas fuel products was found with residual organic contamination in byproduct water reduced to <150 mg/kg COD.","Springer","","Pacific Northwest National Lab.

Data from X ray computed tomography imaging of melting pellets comprised of a simulated high-aluminum HLW feed heated at a rate of 10°C/min reveal the distribution and morphology of bubbles, collectively known as primary foam, within this layer for various SiO<sub>2</sub>/(Li<sub>2</sub>CO<sub>3</sub>+H<sub>3</sub>BO<sub>3</sub>+Na<sub>2</sub>CO<sub>3</sub>) mass fractions at temperatures between 600°C and 1040°C. To track melting dynamics, cross-sections obtained through the central profile of the pellet were digitally segmented into primary foam and a condensed phase. Pellet dimensions were extracted using Photoshop CS6 tools while the DREAM.3D software package was used to calculate pellet profile area, average and maximum bubble areas, and two-dimensional void fraction. The measured linear increase in the pellet area expansion rates – and therefore the increase in batch gas evolution rates – with SiO<sub>2</sub>/(Li<sub>2</sub>CO<sub>3</sub>+H<sub>3</sub>BO<sub>3</sub>+Na<sub>2</sub>CO<sub>3</sub>) mass fraction despite an exponential increase in viscosity of the final waste glass at 1050°C and a lower total amount of gas-evolving species suggest that the retention of primary foam with large average bubble size at higher temperatures results from faster reaction kinetics rather than increased viscosity. However, viscosity does affect the initial foam collapse temperature by supporting the growth of larger bubbles. Because the maximum bubble size is limited by the pellet dimensions, larger scale studies are needed to understand primary foam morphology at high temperatures. This temperature-dependent morphological data can be used in future investigations to synthetically generate cold cap structures for use in models of heat transfer within a HLW glass melter.","American Ceramic Society","","Idaho National Lab.

To assess the potential energy and environmental benefits associated with PTF technology, we calculated the energy, water consumption, and greenhouse gas emissions of NRP-derived ULSD and compared the results to those metrics for conventional ULSD fuel. For these analyses, we used the Greenhouse gases, Regulated Emissions and Energy use in Transportation (GREET®) model. Five companies provided pyrolysis process product yields and material and energy consumption data. Co-products of the process included char and fuel gas. Char can be landfilled, which, per the company responses, is the most common practice for this co-product, or it may be sold as an energy product. Fuel gas can be combusted to internally generate process heat and electricity. Sensitivity analyses investigated the influence of co-product handling methodology, product yield, electric grid composition, and assumed efficiency of char combustion technology on life-cycle greenhouse gas emissions. The sensitivity analysis indicates that the GHG emissions would likely be reduced up to 14% when it is compared to conventional ULSD, depending on the co-product treatment method used. NRP-derived ULSD fuel could therefore be considered at a minimum carbon neutral with the potential to offer a modest GHG reduction. Moreover, this waste-derived fuel had 58% lower water consumption and up to 96% lower fossil fuel consumption than conventional ULSD fuel in the base case. In addition to the comparison of PTF fuels with conventional transportation fuels, we also compare the results with alternative scenarios for managing NRP including power generation and landfilling in the United States.","Elsevier","","Argonne National Lab.

"Anthropogenic influences on groundwater in the vicinity of a long-lived radioactive waste repository: Anthropogenic influences on groundwater","Thomas, Matthew A.; Kuhlman, Kristopher L.; Ward, Anderson L.","54 ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCES; 12 MANAGEMENT OF RADIOACTIVE AND NON-RADIOACTIVE WASTES FROM NUCLEAR FACILITIES","The groundwater flow system in the Culebra Dolomite Member (Culebra) of the Permian Rustler Formation is a potential radionuclide release pathway from the Waste Isolation Pilot Plant (WIPP), the only deep geological repository for transuranic waste in the United States. We did not expect that early conceptual models of the Culebra, groundwater levels would fluctuate markedly, except in response to long-term climatic changes, with response times on the order of hundreds to thousands of years. Recent groundwater pressures measured in monitoring wells record more than 25 m of drawdown. The fluctuations are attributed to pumping activities at a privately-owned well that may be associated with the demand of the Permian Basin hydrocarbon industry for water. Furthermore, the unprecedented magnitude of drawdown provides an opportunity to quantitatively assess the influence of unplanned anthropogenic forcings near the WIPP. Spatially variable realizations of Culebra saturated hydraulic conductivity and storativity were used to develop groundwater flow models to estimate a pumping rate for the private well and investigate its effect on advective transport. Simulated drawdown shows reasonable agreement with observations (average Model Efficiency coefficient = 0.7). Steepened hydraulic gradients associated with the pumping reduce estimates of conservative particle travel times across the domain by one-half and shift the intersection of the average particle track with the compliance boundary by more than two kilometers. Finally, the value of the transient simulations conducted for this study lie in their ability to (i) improve understanding of the Culebra groundwater flow system and (ii) challenge the notion of time-invariant land use in the vicinity of the WIPP.","","","Sandia National Lab.

Flotation behavior of single plastic indicates that PVC can be separated from poly(ethylene terephthalate) (PET), poly(acrylonitrile-co-butadiene-co-styrene) (ABS), polystyrene (PS), polycarbonate (PC) and poly(methyl methacrylate) (PMMA) by froth flotation combined with CHC treatment. Mechanism of CHC treatment was examined by contact angle measurement, scanning electron microscopy, Fourier transform infrared and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy. Under the optimum conditions, separation of PVC from binary plastics with different particle sizes is achieved efficiently. The purity of PC, ABS, PMMA, PS and PET is greater than 96.8%, 98.5%, 98.8%, 97.4% and 96.3%, respectively. Separation of PVC from multi-plastics was further conducted by two-stage flotation. PVC can be separated efficiently from MPWs with residue content of 0.37%. Additionally, reusing CHC solution is practical. This work indicates that separation of hazardous PVC from MPWs is effective by froth flotation.","","Available from http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.wasman.2017.07.049","","","","United States","2017-11-15T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: Waste Management; Journal Volume: 69; Other Information: Copyright (c) 2017 Elsevier Science B.V., Amsterdam, The Netherlands, All rights reserved.; Country of input: International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA)","","Medium: X; Size: page(s) 59-65","","","","Journal ID: ISSN 0956-053X; CODEN: WAMAE2; PII: S0956-053X(17)30577-9; TRN: US17R4428093107","10.1016/J.WASMAN.2017.07.049","","2019-03-08T00:00:00Z","22742163","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/22742163","","Waste Management","","69"

Followed by leaching optimization, silver was selectively recovered through precipitation. The precipitated silver chloride was valorized though silver nanoparticle synthesis by a simple one-pot greener synthesis route. Through leaching-precipitation optimization, quantitative selective recovery of silver chloride was achieved, followed by homogeneous pure silver nanoparticle about 100 nm size were synthesized.

"Methods to estimate the transfer of contaminants into recycling products – A case study from Austria","Knapp, Julika; Allesch, Astrid; Müller, Wolfgang; Bockreis, Anke","54 ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCES; 12 MANAGEMENT OF RADIOACTIVE WASTES, AND NON-RADIOACTIVE WASTES FROM NUCLEAR FACILITIES; AUSTRIA; CONTROL SYSTEMS; HEALTH HAZARDS; LEGAL ASPECTS; QUALITY CONTROL; RECYCLING; RESOURCES","Highlights: • Recycling of waste materials includes the risk of recycling hazardous substances. • Comparison of contaminants in recycling products to primary products and check of compliance with limit values. • Evaluation matrix to quickly scan the environmental and health risks of wastes for recycling. • Optimised sorting and quality control systems prevent transfer of contaminants into product cycles. - Abstract: Recycling of waste materials is desirable to reduce the consumption of limited primary resources, but also includes the risk of recycling unwanted, hazardous substances. In Austria, the legal framework demands secondary products must not present a higher risk than comparable products derived from primary resources. However, the act provides no definition on how to assess this risk potential. This paper describes the development of different quantitative and qualitative methods to estimate the transfer of contaminants in recycling processes. The quantitative methods comprise the comparison of concentrations of harmful substances in recycling products to corresponding primary products and to existing limit values. The developed evaluation matrix, which considers further aspects, allows for the assessment of the qualitative risk potential. The results show that, depending on the assessed waste fraction, particular contaminants can be critical. Their concentrations were higher than in comparable primary materials and did not comply with existing limit values. On the other hand, the results show that a long-term, well-established quality control system can assure compliance with the limit values. The results of the qualitative assessment obtained with the evaluation matrix support the results of the quantitative assessment. Therefore, the evaluation matrix can be suitable to quickly screen waste streams used for recycling to estimate their potential environmental and health risks. To prevent the transfer of contaminants into product cycles, improved data of relevant substances in secondary resources are necessary. In addition, regulations for material recycling are required to assure adequate quality control measures, including limit values.","","Available from http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.wasman.2017.08.035","","","","United States","2017-11-15T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: Waste Management; Journal Volume: 69; Other Information: Copyright (c) 2017 Elsevier Science B.V., Amsterdam, The Netherlands, All rights reserved.; Country of input: International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA)","","Medium: X; Size: page(s) 88-100","","","","Journal ID: ISSN 0956-053X; CODEN: WAMAE2; PII: S0956-053X(17)30613-X; TRN: US17R4431093110","10.1016/J.WASMAN.2017.08.035","","2019-03-08T00:00:00Z","22742166","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/22742166","","Waste Management","","69"

As waste tyres are composed, primarily, of carbon – accounting for some 81.2 wt% – they represent a promising source of carbon for many potential applications. However, cost-effective options for their processing are limited and, consequently, billions of waste tyres have accumulated in landfills and stockpiles, posing a serious global environmental threat. The rapid, high temperature transformation of low value WTR to produce valuable CNPs, reported here, addresses this challenge. In this study, the transformation of WTRs was carried out at 1550 °C over different reaction times (5 s to 20 min). The structure and morphology of the resulting CNPs were investigated using X-ray diffraction (XRD), Raman spectroscopy, X-ray photon spectroscopy (XPS), N{sub 2} isothermal adsorption method and scanning electron microscopy (SEM). The formation of CNPs with diameters of 30 and 40 nm was confirmed by Field Emission Electron Microscopy (FE-SEM). Longer heating times also resulted in CNPs with regular and uniform spherical shapes and a specific surface area of up to 117.7 m{sup 2}/g, after 20 min. A mechanism that describes the formation of CNPs through mesophase nuclei intermediate is suggested.","","Available from http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.wasman.2017.08.020","","","","United States","2017-11-15T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: Waste Management; Journal Volume: 69; Other Information: Copyright (c) 2017 Elsevier Science B.V., Amsterdam, The Netherlands, All rights reserved.; Country of input: International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA)","","Medium: X; Size: page(s) 110-116","","","","Journal ID: ISSN 0956-053X; CODEN: WAMAE2; PII: S0956-053X(17)30592-5; TRN: US17R4432093111","10.1016/J.WASMAN.2017.08.020","","2019-03-08T00:00:00Z","22742167","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/22742167","","Waste Management","","69"

Gasification of dried digestate to produce gasesous product might be a promising route. In this work, air gasification of digestate with high ash content was performed in a downdraft fixed bed gasifier at temperature varying from 600 °C to 800 °C and air equivalence ratio (ER) ranging from 0.25 to 0.30. The ash melting properties were firstly detected by the Intelligent Ash Melting Point Test, and the by-products (biochar and ash) were analyzed. The results showed that no ash slagging was observed and therefore it is feasible to operate digestate gasification under 800 °C and ER ranging from 0.25 to 0.30. High temperature favored gas production, 800 °C is proposed for digestate gasification in the present study. ER with a medium value improved gas quality and cold gas efficiency (CGE), and the optimal LHV of 4.78 MJ/N m{sup 3} and CGE of 67.01% were obtained with ER of 0.28. High ER favored the increase of gas yield and decrease of tar concentration, and the optimal gas yield of 2.15 N m{sup 3}/kg and tar concentration of 1.61 g/N m{sup 3} were achieved with ER of 0.30. Improved molar ratio of H{sub 2}/CO varying from 1.03 to 1.08 was obtained at 800 °C, indicating gaseous product has the potential for chemical synthesis processes (1 < H{sub 2}/CO < 2).

This paper aims to be a sensible response, with the aid of a comparison between China and some representative developed regions including the EU, the U.S., Japan, South Korea, and Taiwan area. A large number of up-to-date data and information are collected to quantitatively and impartially support the comparison, which covers a wider range of key points including spatial distribution, temporal evolution, technologies, emissions, and perspectives. Analysis results show that MSW incineration is not an outdated choice; however, policy making should prevent the potentially insufficient utilization of MSW incinerators. The structure of MSW incineration technologies is changing in China. The ratio of plants using fluidized bed is decreasing due to various realistic reasons. Decision-makers would select suitable combustion technologies by comprehensive assessments, rather than just by costs. Air pollution control systems are improved with the implementation of China’s new emission standard. However, MSW incineration in China is currently blamed for substandard emissions. The reasons include the particular elemental compositions of Chinese MSW, the lack of operating experience, deficient fund for compliance with the emission standard, and the lack of reliable supervisory measures. Some perspectives and suggestions from both technical and managerial aspects are given for the compliance with the emission standard. This paper can provide strategic enlightenments for MSW management in China and other developing countries.","","Available from http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.wasman.2017.04.014","","","","United States","2017-11-15T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: Waste Management; Journal Volume: 69; Other Information: Copyright (c) 2017 Elsevier Science B.V., Amsterdam, The Netherlands, All rights reserved.; Country of input: International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA)","","Medium: X; Size: page(s) 170-186","","","","Journal ID: ISSN 0956-053X; CODEN: WAMAE2; PII: S0956-053X(17)30231-3; TRN: US17R4435093114","10.1016/J.WASMAN.2017.04.014","","2019-03-08T00:00:00Z","22742170","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/22742170","","Waste Management","","69"

Ammonium nitrogen was found to be approximately 1300 mg/L in leachates from younger landfill units (less than 10 years old), and approximately 500 mg/L in leachates from older landfill units (up to 30 years old). The concentration and aerobic biodegradability of organic nitrogen decreased with landfill age. A size distribution study showed that most organic nitrogen in landfill leachates is <1 kDa. The Lowry protein concentration (mg/L-N) was analyzed and showed a strong correlation with the total organic nitrogen (TON, mg/L-N, R{sup 2} = 0.88 and 0.98 for untreated and treated samples, respectively). The slopes of the regression curves of untreated (protein = 0.45TON) and treated (protein = 0.31TON) leachates indicated that the protein is more biodegradable than the other organic nitrogen species in landfill leachates. XAD-8 resin was employed to isolate the hydrophilic fraction of leachate samples, and it was found that the hydrophilic fraction proportion in terms of organic nitrogen decreased with landfill age. Solid-state {sup 15}N nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) was utilized to identify the nitrogen species. Proteinaceous materials were found to be readily biodegradable, while heterocyclic nitrogen species were found to be resistant to biodegradation.","","Available from http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.wasman.2017.07.041","","","","United States","2017-11-15T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: Waste Management; Journal Volume: 69; Other Information: Copyright (c) 2017 Elsevier Science B.V., Amsterdam, The Netherlands, All rights reserved.; Country of input: International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA)","","Medium: X; Size: page(s) 225-231","","","","Journal ID: ISSN 0956-053X; CODEN: WAMAE2; PII: S0956-053X(17)30533-0; TRN: US17R4436093115","10.1016/J.WASMAN.2017.07.041","","2019-03-08T00:00:00Z","22742171","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/22742171","","Waste Management","","69"

In addition, the process is able to enhance the biodegradability index (BOD/COD) of landfill leachate, which make mature or stabilized landfill leachate suitable for biological treatment. The elevated concentration of ammonium nitrogen especially observed in bioreactor landfill leachate can also be reduced by electrochemical oxidation. The pollutant removal efficiency of the system depends upon the mechanism of oxidation (direct or indirect oxidation) which depends upon the property of anode material. Applied current density, pH, type and concentration of electrolyte, inter-electrode gap, mass transfer mode, total anode area to volume of effluent to be treated ratio, temperature, flow rate or flow velocity, reactor geometry, cathode material and lamp power during photoelectrochemical oxidation may also influence the system performance. In this review paper, past and present scenarios of landfill leachate treatment efficiencies and costs of various lab scale, pilot scale electrochemical oxidation studies as a standalone system or integrated with biological and physicochemical processes have been reviewed with the conclusion that electrochemical oxidation can be employed as a complementary treatment system with biological process for conventional landfill leachate treatment as well as a standalone system for ammonium nitrogen removal from bioreactor landfill leachate. Furthermore, present drawbacks of electrochemical oxidation process as a landfill leachate treatment system and relevance of incorporating life cycle assessment into the decision-making process besides process efficiency and cost, have been discussed.","","Available from http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.wasman.2017.08.034","","","","United States","2017-11-15T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: Waste Management; Journal Volume: 69; Other Information: Copyright (c) 2017 Elsevier Science B.V., Amsterdam, The Netherlands, All rights reserved.; Country of input: International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA)","","Medium: X; Size: page(s) 250-273","","","","Journal ID: ISSN 0956-053X; CODEN: WAMAE2; PII: S0956-053X(17)30612-8; TRN: US17R4437093116","10.1016/J.WASMAN.2017.08.034","","2019-03-08T00:00:00Z","22742172","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/22742172","","Waste Management","","69"

Life cycle assessment (LCA) approach was applied to evaluate the performance of CWM systems holistically based on primary data collected from two real building construction sites and secondary data obtained from the literature. Different waste recovery rates were applied based on compositions and material flow to assess the influence on the environmental performance of CWM systems. The system boundary includes all stages of the life cycle of building construction waste (including transportation, sorting, public fill or landfill disposal, recovery and reuse, and transformation and valorization into secondary products). A substitutional LCA approach was applied for capturing the environmental gains due to the utilizations of recovered materials. The results showed that the CWM system by using off-site sorting and direct landfilling resulted in significant environmental impacts. However, a considerable net environmental benefit was observed through an on-site sorting system. For example, about 18–30 kg CO{sub 2} eq. greenhouse gases (GHGs) emission were induced for managing 1 t of construction waste through off-site sorting and direct landfilling, whereas significant GHGs emission could be potentially avoided (considered as a credit −126 to −182 kg CO{sub 2} eq.) for an on-site sorting system due to the higher recycling potential. Although the environmental benefits mainly depend on the waste compositions and their sortability, the analysis conducted in this study can serve as guidelines to design an effective and resource-efficient building CWM system.","","Available from http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.wasman.2017.07.043","","","","United States","2017-11-15T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: Waste Management; Journal Volume: 69; Other Information: Copyright (c) 2017 Elsevier Science B.V., Amsterdam, The Netherlands, All rights reserved.; Country of input: International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA)","","Medium: X; Size: page(s) 325-335","","","","Journal ID: ISSN 0956-053X; CODEN: WAMAE2; PII: S0956-053X(17)30536-6; TRN: US17R4439093118","10.1016/J.WASMAN.2017.07.043","","2019-03-08T00:00:00Z","22742174","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/22742174","","Waste Management","","69"

Carbon emission during the process of municipal sewage treatment and disposal has become one of the important sources of greenhouse gases that cause greenhouse effect. How to reduce carbon dioxide emissions during sewage treatment and disposal process is of great significance for reducing air pollution. Kitchen waste and excess sludge, as two important organic wastes, once uses anaerobic synergetic digestion technology in the treatment process can on the one hand, avoid instability of sludge individual anaerobic digestion, improve sludge degradation rate and marsh gas production rate, and on the other hand, help increase the reduction of carbon dioxide emissions to a great extent.

As the circular economy approach replaces the linear model, resource recycling activities become a priority in waste management policy. As new techniques and possibilities of waste collection systems emerge, opportunities are created for improving efficiency for collection companies and affording benefits for the environment. A model proposed for mobile WEEE collection in this study considers a multi-criteria approach in developing a cost efficient method for pick up on demand from residents or electrical and electronic equipment (EEE) stores. The algorithm used in this model optimises vehicle routes and helps in selecting a number of vehicles from a heterogeneous fleet, incorporating the WEEE loading problem. Using genetic algorithm and fuzzy logic, this model optimises costs and resources required to complete the WEEE collection assuring timely pick up of the waste equipment. The numerical model is verified in a case study in Opole, a city in the south of Poland. The results show that the proposed model can handle the multiple parameter optimisation problem including operational costs, efficient use of vehicles from a fleet, efficient waste loading in vehicles and residents' satisfaction with timely pick up of the waste equipment from a household. Such system can be successfully applied even for large cities. The algorithm provides an opportunity for writing software or mobile apps design to be used by WEEE collection companies.","","Available from http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.wasman.2017.07.045","","","","United States","2017-11-15T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: Waste Management; Journal Volume: 69; Other Information: Copyright (c) 2017 Elsevier Science B.V., Amsterdam, The Netherlands, All rights reserved.; Country of input: International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA)","","Medium: X; Size: page(s) 377-392","","","","Journal ID: ISSN 0956-053X; CODEN: WAMAE2; PII: S0956-053X(17)30537-8; TRN: US17R4444093123","10.1016/J.WASMAN.2017.07.045","","2019-03-08T00:00:00Z","22742179","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/22742179","","Waste Management","","69"

The target plastics included polycarbonate (PC), polystyrene (PS), acrylonitrile butadiene styrene (ABS), and styrene acrylonitrile (SAN). The extraction procedure for multi-polymers at room temperature yielded PC, PS, ABS, and SAN in acceptable recovery rates (64%, 86%, 127%, and 143%, respectively, where recovery rate is defined as the mass ratio of the recovered plastic to the added standard polymer). Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR) was used to verify the recovered plastics’ purity using a similarity analysis. The similarities ranged from 0.98 to 0.99. Another similar process, which was denoted as an alternative method for plastic recovery, was examined as well. Nonetheless, the FTIR results showed degradation may occur over time. Additionally, the recovery cost estimation model of our method was established. The recovery cost estimation indicated that a certain range of proportion of plastics in e-waste, especially with a higher proportion of PC and PS, can achieve a lower cost than virgin polymer product. It also reduced 99.6%, 30.7% and 75.8% of energy consumptions and CO{sub 2} emissions during the recovery of PC, PS and ABS, and reduced the amount of plastic waste disposal via landfill or incineration and associated environmental impacts.","","Available from http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.wasman.2017.08.018","","","","United States","2017-11-15T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: Waste Management; Journal Volume: 69; Other Information: Copyright (c) 2017 Elsevier Science B.V., Amsterdam, The Netherlands, All rights reserved.; Country of input: International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA)","","Medium: X; Size: page(s) 393-399","","","","Journal ID: ISSN 0956-053X; CODEN: WAMAE2; PII: S0956-053X(17)30589-5; TRN: US17R4445093124","10.1016/J.WASMAN.2017.08.018","","2019-03-08T00:00:00Z","22742180","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/22742180","","Waste Management","","69"

Fossil fuel reserves are being exploited at a very fast rate to meet the increasing energy demands, so there is a need to find alternative sources of energy before all the fossil fuel reserves are depleted. Waste to energy (WTE) can be considered as a potential alternative source of energy, which is economically viable and environmentally sustainable. The present study reviewed the current global scenario of WTE technological options (incineration, pyrolysis, gasification, anaerobic digestion, and landfilling with gas recovery) for effective energy recovery and the challenges faced by developed and developing countries. This review will provide a framework for evaluating WTE technological options based on case studies of developed and developing countries. Unsanitary landfilling is the most commonly practiced waste disposal option in the developing countries. However, developed countries have realised the potential of WTE technologies for effective municipal solid waste management (MSWM). This review will help the policy makers and the implementing authorities involved in MSWM to understand the current status, challenges and barriers for effective management of municipal solid waste. This review concluded WTE as a potential renewable source of energy, which will partly meet the energy demand and ensure effective MSWM.","","Available from http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.wasman.2017.08.046","","","","United States","2017-11-15T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: Waste Management; Journal Volume: 69; Other Information: Copyright (c) 2017 Elsevier Science B.V., Amsterdam, The Netherlands, All rights reserved.; Country of input: International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA)","","Medium: X; Size: page(s) 407-422","","","","Journal ID: ISSN 0956-053X; CODEN: WAMAE2; PII: S0956-053X(17)30626-8; TRN: US17R4446093125","10.1016/J.WASMAN.2017.08.046","","2019-03-08T00:00:00Z","22742181","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/22742181","","Waste Management","","69"

For this purpose, a model adopting a life cycle inventory approach was developed to integrate solid waste and wastewater management processes under a single framework and test scenarios for a waste with high organic food content typical of developing economies. For such a waste composition, the results show that a FWD policy can reduce emissions by nearly ∼42% depending on market penetration, fraction of food waste ground, as well as solid waste and wastewater management schemes, including potential energy recovery. In comparison to baseline, equivalent economic gains can reach ∼28% when environmental externalities including sludge management and emissions variations are considered. The sensitivity analyses on processes with a wide range in costs showed an equivalent economic impact thus emphasizing the viability of a FWD policy although the variation in the cost of sludge management exhibited a significant impact on savings.","","Available from http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.wasman.2017.08.008","","","","United States","2017-11-15T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: Waste Management; Journal Volume: 69; Other Information: Copyright (c) 2017 Elsevier Science B.V., Amsterdam, The Netherlands, All rights reserved.; Country of input: International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA)","","Medium: X; Size: page(s) 455-462","","","","Journal ID: ISSN 0956-053X; CODEN: WAMAE2; PII: S0956-053X(17)30578-0; TRN: US17R4447093126","10.1016/J.WASMAN.2017.08.008","","2019-03-08T00:00:00Z","22742182","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/22742182","","Waste Management","","69"

Conventional swine waste treatment options in the U.S., such as uncovered anaerobic lagoons, result in poor effluent quality and greenhouse gas emissions, and implementation of advanced treatment introduces high costs. Therefore, the purpose of this paper is to evaluate the performance and life cycle costs of an alternative system for treating swine CAFO waste, which recovers valuable energy (as biogas) and nutrients (N, P, K{sup +}) as saleable fertilizers. The system uses in-vessel anaerobic digestion (AD) for methane production and solids stabilization, followed by struvite precipitation and ion exchange (IX) onto natural zeolites (chabazite or clinoptilolite) for nutrient recovery. An alternative approach that integrated struvite recovery and IX into a single reactor, termed STRIEX, was also investigated. Pilot- and bench-scale reactor experiments were used to evaluate the performance of each stage in the treatment train. Data from these studies were integrated into a life cycle cost analysis (LCCA) to assess the cost-effectiveness of various process alternatives. Significant improvement in water quality, high methane production, and high nutrient recovery (generally over 90%) were observed with both the AD-struvite-IX process and the AD-STRIEX process. The LCCA showed that the STRIEX system can provide considerable financial savings compared to conventional systems. AD, however, incurs high capital costs compared to conventional anaerobic lagoons and may require larger scales to become financially attractive.","","Available from http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.wasman.2017.08.041","","","","United States","2017-11-15T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: Waste Management; Journal Volume: 69; Other Information: Copyright (c) 2017 Elsevier Science B.V., Amsterdam, The Netherlands, All rights reserved.; Country of input: International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA)","","Medium: X; Size: page(s) 508-517","","","","Journal ID: ISSN 0956-053X; CODEN: WAMAE2; PII: S0956-053X(17)30619-0; TRN: US17R4448093127","10.1016/J.WASMAN.2017.08.041","","2019-03-08T00:00:00Z","22742183","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/22742183","","Waste Management","","69"

The model calculates the optimum locations of the treatment facilities and transfer stations, their design capacities (t/d), the number and capacities of all waste collection, transport and transfer vehicles and their optimum transport path and the minimum IMW management system cost. Waste production nodes (hospitals, healthcare centers, peripheral health offices, private clinics and physicians in private practice) and their IMW production rates were specified and used as model inputs. The candidate locations of the treatment facilities, transfer stations and sanitary landfills were designated, using a GIS-based methodology. Specifically, Mapinfo software with exclusion criteria for non-appropriate areas was used for siting candidate locations for the construction of the treatment plant and calculating the distance and travel time of all possible vehicle routes. The objective function was a non-linear equation, which minimized the total collection, transport, treatment and disposal cost. Total cost comprised capital and operation costs for: (1) treatment plant, (2) waste transfer stations, (3) waste transport and transfer vehicles and (4) waste collection bins and hospital boxes. Binary variables were used to decide whether a treatment plant and/or a transfer station should be constructed and whether a collection route between two or more nodes should be followed. Microsoft excel software was used as installation platform of the optimization model. For the execution of the optimization routine, two completely different software were used and the results were compared, thus, resulting in higher reliability and validity of the results. The first software was Evolver, which is based on the use of genetic algorithms. The second one was Crystal Ball, which is based on Monte Carlo simulation. The model was applied to the Region of East Macedonia – Thrace in Greece. The optimum solution resulted in one treatment plant located in the sanitary landfill area of Chrysoupolis, required no transfer stations and had a total management cost of 38,800 €/month or 809 €/t. If a treatment plant is sited in the most eastern part of the Region, i.e., the industrial area of Alexandroupolis, the optimum solution would result in a transfer station of 23 m{sup 3}, located near Kavala General Hospital, and a total cost of 39,800 €/month or 831 €/t. A sensitivity analysis was conducted and two alternative scenarios were optimized. In the first scenario, a 15% rise in fuel cost and in the second scenario a 25% rise in IMW production were considered. At the end, a cost calculation in €/t/km for every type of vehicle used for haul and transfer was conducted. Also, the cost of the whole system was itemized and calculated in €/t/km and €/t. The results showed that the higher percentage of the total cost was due to the construction of the treatment plant.","","Available from http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.wasman.2017.08.037","","","","United States","2017-11-15T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: Waste Management; Journal Volume: 69; Other Information: Copyright (c) 2017 Elsevier Science B.V., Amsterdam, The Netherlands, All rights reserved.; Country of input: International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA)","","Medium: X; Size: page(s) 518-534","","","","Journal ID: ISSN 0956-053X; CODEN: WAMAE2; PII: S0956-053X(17)30615-3; TRN: US17R4449093128","10.1016/J.WASMAN.2017.08.037","","2019-03-08T00:00:00Z","22742184","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/22742184","","Waste Management","","69"
"Life cycle inventory and mass-balance of municipal food waste management systems: Decision support methods beyond the waste hierarchy","Edwards, Joel; Othman, Maazuza; Crossin, Enda; Burn, Stewart; Manufacturing Flagship, Commonwealth Scientific and Industrial Research Organisation (CSIRO), Clayton 3168 (Australia)]","54 ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCES; 12 MANAGEMENT OF RADIOACTIVE WASTES, AND NON-RADIOACTIVE WASTES FROM NUCLEAR FACILITIES; EFFICIENCY; EMISSION; ENERGY BALANCE; FOOD; LIFE CYCLE; MUNICIPAL WASTES; SANITARY LANDFILLS; SOLID WASTES","Highlights: • Life cycle inventory of 7 food waste management and treatment systems considered. • Energy balance notably different to a systems energy generation. • Food in-sink maceration shown to have volatiles reduced by 31% before digestion. • Mass-balance identifies recycling efficiency and product utility. • Increased landfill diversion confirmed to be critical for a lower emissions profile. - Abstract: When assessing the environmental and human health impact of a municipal food waste (FW) management system waste managers typically rely on the principles of the waste hierarchy; using metrics such as the mass or rate of waste that is ‘prepared for recycling,’ ‘recovered for energy,’ or ‘sent to landfill.’ These metrics measure the collection and sorting efficiency of a waste system but are incapable of determining the efficiency of a system to turn waste into a valuable resource. In this study a life cycle approach was employed using a system boundary that includes the entire waste service provision from collection to safe end-use or disposal. A life cycle inventory of seven waste management systems was calculated, including the first service wide inventory of FW management through kitchen in-sink disposal (food waste disposer). Results describe the mass, energy and water balance of each system along with key emissions profile. It was demonstrated that the energy balance can differ significantly from its’ energy generation, exemplified by mechanical biological treatment, which was the best system for generating energy from waste but only 5{sup th} best for net-energy generation. Furthermore, the energy balance of kitchen in-sink disposal was shown to be reduced because 31% of volatile solids were lost in pre-treatment. The study also confirmed that higher FW landfill diversion rates were critical for reducing many harmful emissions to air and water. Although, mass-balance analysis showed that the alternative end-use of the FW material may still contain high impact pollutants.","","Available from http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.wasman.2017.08.011","","","","United States","2017-11-15T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: Waste Management; Journal Volume: 69; Other Information: Copyright (c) 2017 Elsevier Science B.V., Amsterdam, The Netherlands, All rights reserved.; Country of input: International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA)","","Medium: X; Size: page(s) 577-591","","","","Journal ID: ISSN 0956-053X; CODEN: WAMAE2; PII: S0956-053X(17)30581-0; TRN: US17R4452093131","10.1016/J.WASMAN.2017.08.011","","2019-03-08T00:00:00Z","22742187","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/22742187","","Waste Management","","69"
"Assessing the costs of municipal solid waste treatment technologies in developing Asian countries","Aleluia, João; Ferrão, Paulo","12 MANAGEMENT OF RADIOACTIVE WASTES, AND NON-RADIOACTIVE WASTES FROM NUCLEAR FACILITIES; HEAT TREATMENTS; MUNICIPAL WASTES; REFUSE DERIVED FUELS; SOLID WASTES; WASTE DISPOSAL","Highlights: • Municipal waste treatment costs are assessed for the first time in developing Asia. • A database with primary and secondary data from existing plants was prepared. • Capital and operational expenditures patterns were analyzed and discussed. • Incineration identified by large margin as the costliest approach for treating waste. • Context specific circumstances are key to explain deviations from the norm. - Abstract: The management of municipal solid waste (MSW) is one of the main costs incurred by local authorities in developing countries. According to some estimates, these costs can account for up to 50% of city government budgets. It is therefore of importance that policymakers, urban planners and practitioners have an adequate understanding of what these costs consist of, from collection to final waste disposal. This article focuses on a specific stage of the MSW value chain, the treatment of waste, and it aims to identify cost patterns associated with the implementation and operation of waste treatment approaches in developing Asian countries. An analysis of the capital (CAPEX) and operational expenditures (OPEX) of a number of facilities located in countries of the region was conducted based on a database gathering nearly 100 projects and which served as basis for assessing four technology categories: composting, anaerobic digestion (AD), thermal treatment, and the production of refuse-derived fuel (RDF). Among these, it was found that the least costly to invest, as a function of the capacity to process waste, are composting facilities, with an average CAPEX per ton of 21,493 USD{sub 2015}/ton. Conversely, at the upper end featured incineration plants, with an average CAPEX of 81,880 USD{sub 2015}/ton, with this treatment approach ranking by and large as the most capital intensive of the four categories assessed. OPEX figures of the plants, normalized and analyzed in the form of OPEX/ton, were also found to be higher for incineration than for biological treatment methods, although on this component differences amongst the technology groups were less pronounced than those observed for CAPEX. While the results indicated the existence of distinct cost implications for available treatment approaches in the developing Asian context, the analysis also underscored the importance of understanding the local context as a means to properly identify the cost structure of each specific plant. Moreover, even though CAPEX and OPEX figures are important elements to assess the costs of a waste treatment system, these should not be considered on a standalone basis for decision making purposes. In complement to this internal cost dimension, the broader impacts – to the economy, society and the environment – resulting from the adoption of a certain treatment approach should be properly understood and, ideally, measured and expressed in monetary terms.","","Available from http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.wasman.2017.08.047","","","","United States","2017-11-15T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: Waste Management; Journal Volume: 69; Other Information: Copyright (c) 2017 Elsevier Science B.V., Amsterdam, The Netherlands, All rights reserved.; Country of input: International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA)","","Medium: X; Size: page(s) 592-608","","","","Journal ID: ISSN 0956-053X; CODEN: WAMAE2; PII: S0956-053X(17)30627-X; TRN: US17R4453093132","10.1016/J.WASMAN.2017.08.047","","2019-03-08T00:00:00Z","22742188","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/22742188","","Waste Management","","69"

Three 10-day experiments were conducted using two 50-L reactors. In the first two, nitrogen removal efficiencies were evaluated from identical digestates maintained at different temperatures (30 °C and 40 °C). At the start of the first experiment, the digestates were adjusted to pH 9 using sodium hydroxide, while in the second experiment pH was not adjusted. The highest ammonia removal efficiency (87%) was obtained at 40 °C with pH adjustment. However at 40 °C without pH adjustment, removal efficiencies of 69% for ammonia and 47% for total nitrogen were obtained. In the third experiment two different digestates were tested at 50 °C without pH adjustment. Although the initial chemical characteristics of the digestates were different in this experiment, the ammonia removal efficiencies were very similar (approximately 85%). Despite ammonia removal, the pH increased in all experiments, most likely due to carbon dioxide stripping that was promoted by temperature and mixing. The technique proved to be suitable for removing nitrogen following anaerobic digestion of livestock manure because effective removal was obtained at natural pH (≈8) and 40 °C, common operating conditions at typical biogas plants that process manure. Furthermore, the electrical energy requirement to operate the process is limited (estimated to be 3.8 kW h m{sup −3} digestate). Further improvements may increase the efficiency and reduce the processing time of this treatment technique. Even without these advances slow-rate air stripping of ammonia is a viable option for reducing the environmental impact associated with animal manure management.","","Available from http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.wasman.2017.07.047","","","","United States","2017-11-15T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: Waste Management; Journal Volume: 69; Other Information: Copyright (c) 2017 Elsevier Science B.V., Amsterdam, The Netherlands, All rights reserved.; Country of input: International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA)","","Medium: X; Size: page(s) 154-161","","","","Journal ID: ISSN 0956-053X; CODEN: WAMAE2; PII: S0956-053X(17)30568-8; TRN: US17R4433093112","10.1016/J.WASMAN.2017.07.047","","2019-03-08T00:00:00Z","22742168","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/22742168","","Waste Management","","69"

Yet, there is still much speculation among researchers, policy makers and planners about how to tackle marine litter from land-based sources. This paper provides insights into approaches for managing marine litter by reporting and analyzing survey results of litter dispersal and makeup from three areas along an Arab-Israeli coastal town in view of other recent studies conducted around the Mediterranean Sea. Based on our results and analysis, we posit that bathing beach activities should be a high priority for waste managers as a point of intervention and beach-goers must be encouraged to take a more active role in keeping beaches clean. Further, plastic fragments on the beach should be targeted as a first priority for prevention (and cleanup) of marine litter with plastic bottle caps being a high priority to be targeted among plastics. More survey research is needed on non-plastic litter composition for which amounts and geographic dispersal in the region vary greatly from place to place along Mediterranean shores. In general, findings of this study lead us to recommend exploring persuasive beach trash can design coupled with greater enforcement for short term waste management intervention while considering the local socio-economic and institutional context further for long-term efforts.","","Available from http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.wasman.2017.07.040","","","","United States","2017-11-15T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: Waste Management; Journal Volume: 69; Other Information: Copyright (c) 2017 Elsevier Science B.V., Amsterdam, The Netherlands, All rights reserved.; Country of input: International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA)","","Medium: X; Size: page(s) 535-544","","","","Journal ID: ISSN 0956-053X; CODEN: WAMAE2; PII: S0956-053X(17)30532-9; TRN: US17R4450093129","10.1016/J.WASMAN.2017.07.040","","2019-03-08T00:00:00Z","22742185","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/22742185","","Waste Management","","69"
"Environmental performance of household waste management in Europe - An example of 7 countries","Andreasi Bassi, Susanna, E-mail: suan@env.dtu.dk; Christensen, Thomas H.; Damgaard, Anders","12 MANAGEMENT OF RADIOACTIVE WASTES, AND NON-RADIOACTIVE WASTES FROM NUCLEAR FACILITIES; ENVIRONMENTAL IMPACTS; HOUSEHOLDS; LIFE CYCLE ASSESSMENT; PERFORMANCE; RECYCLING; SANITARY LANDFILLS; SENSITIVITY ANALYSIS; WASTES","Highlights: • Attributional LCA of household waste management in 7 EU countries. • Country-specific technologies and waste composition are crucial for impacts. • Proper waste management is a benefit to society. • Waste hierarchy focus needs to change from quantity to quality. • Need for overall improvement in waste data. - Abstract: An attributional life cycle assessment (LCA) of the management of 1 ton of household waste was conducted in accordance with ISO 14044:2006 and the ILCD Handbook for seven European countries, namely Germany, Denmark, France, UK, Italy, Poland and Greece, representing different household waste compositions, waste management practices, technologies, and energy systems. National data were collected from a range of sources regarding household waste composition, household sorting efficiency, collection, waste treatments, recycling, electricity and heat composition, and technological efficiencies. The objective was to quantify the environmental performance in the different countries, in order to analyze the sources of the main environmental impacts and national differences which affect the results. In most of the seven countries, household waste management provides environmental benefits when considering the benefits of recycling of materials and recovering and utilization of energy. Environmental benefits come from paper recycling and, to a lesser extent, the recycling of metals and glass. Waste-to-energy plants can lead to an environmental load (as in France) or a saving (Germany and Denmark), depending mainly on the composition of the energy being substituted. Sensitivity analysis and a data quality assessment identified a range of critical parameters, suggesting from where better data should be obtained. The study concluded that household waste management is environmentally the best in European countries with a minimum reliance on landfilling, also induced by the implementation of the Waste Hierarchy, though environmental performance does not correlate clearly with the rate of material recycling. From an environmental point of view, this calls for a change in the waste management paradigm, with less focus on where the waste is routed and more of a focus on the quality and utilization of recovered materials and energy.","","Available from http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.wasman.2017.07.042","","","","United States","2017-11-15T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: Waste Management; Journal Volume: 69; Other Information: Copyright (c) 2017 Elsevier Science B.V., Amsterdam, The Netherlands, All rights reserved.; Country of input: International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA)","","Medium: X; Size: page(s) 545-557","","","","Journal ID: ISSN 0956-053X; CODEN: WAMAE2; PII: S0956-053X(17)30534-2; TRN: US17R4451093130","10.1016/J.WASMAN.2017.07.042","","2019-03-08T00:00:00Z","22742186","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/22742186","","Waste Management","","69"

The NRC staff performs its technical review of these designs in accordance with 10 CFR Part 72 and NUREG-1536, 'Standard Review Plan for Spent Fuel Dry Storage Systems at a General License Facility,' Revision 1, issued July 2010. To ensure that the cask and fuel material temperatures of the dry cask storage system remain within the allowable limits or criteria for normal, off-normal, and accident conditions, the NRC staff performs a thermal review as part of the technical review. Recent applications increasingly have used thermalhydraulic analyses using computational fluid dynamics (CFD) codes (e.g., ANSYS FLUENT) to demonstrate the adequacy of the thermal design. The NRC performs validation studies of the FLUENT CFD code to assist it in making regulatory decisions to ensure adequate protection for storage and transportation casks. Recent advances in dry storage cask designs have significantly increased the maximum thermal load allowed in a cask in part by increasing the efficiency of internal conduction pathways and by increasing the internal convection through greater canister helium pressure. In efforts to further validate these designs, the NRC in conjunction with the Department of Energy and Sandia National Laboratories (SNL) are conducting an experiment to capture the effects of elevated helium pressures and accurately portray the external convection of aboveground and belowground canister dry cask systems.","","","","","","United States","2017-07-01T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","Conference","Journal Name: Transactions of the American Nuclear Society; Journal Volume: 116; Conference: 2017 Annual Meeting of the American Nuclear Society, San Francisco, CA (United States), 11-15 Jun 2017; Other Information: Country of input: France; 8 refs.; available from American Nuclear Society - ANS, 555 North Kensington Avenue, La Grange Park, IL 60526 (US)","","Medium: X; Size: page(s) 1428-1431","","","","Journal ID: ISSN 0003-018X; TRN: US21V3204090793","","","2021-11-02T00:00:00Z","23050408","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/23050408","","Transactions of the American Nuclear Society","","116"

Ionic liquid (IL) pretreatment has gained a significant interest as a pretreatment process that can reduce cellulose crystallinity and remove lignin, key factors that govern enzyme accessibility. There are several challenges that need to be addressed for IL pretreatment to become viable for commercialization, including IL cost and recyclability. In addition, it is unclear whether ILs can maintain process performance when utilizing low-cost, low-quality biomass feedstocks such as the paper fraction of municipal solid waste (MSW), which are readily available in high quantities. One approach to potentially reduce IL cost is to use a blend of ILs at different concentrations in aqueous mixtures. Herein, we describe 14 IL-water systems with mixtures of 1-ethyl-3-ethylimidazolium acetate ([C 2 C 1 Im][OAc] ), 1-butyl-3-ethylimidazolium acetate ([C 4 C 1 Im][OAc] ), and water that were used to pretreat MSW blended with agave bagasse (AGB). The detailed analysis of IL recycling in terms of sugar yields of pretreated biomass and IL stability was examined. Results: Both biomass types (AGB and MSW) were efficiently disrupted by IL pretreatment. The pretreatment efficiency of [C 2 C 1 Im][OAc] and [C 4 C 1 Im][OAc] decreased when mixed with water above 40%. The AGB/MSW (1:1) blend demonstrated a glucan conversion of 94.1 and 83.0% using IL systems with ~10 and ~40% water content, respectively. Chemical structures of fresh ILs and recycle ILs presented strong similarities observed by FTIR and 1 H-NMR spectroscopy. The glucan and xylan hydrolysis yields obtained from recycled IL exhibited a slight decrease in pretreatment efficiency (less than 10% in terms of hydrolysis yields compared to that of fresh IL), and a decrease in cellulose crystallinity was observed. Conclusions: Our results demonstrated that mixing ILs such as [C 2 C 1 Im][OAc] and [C 4 C 1 Im][OAc] and blending the paper fraction of MSW with agricultural residues, such as AGB, may contribute to lower the production costs while maintaining high sugar yields. Recycled IL-water mixtures provided comparable results to that of fresh ILs. Both of these results offer the potential of reducing the production costs of sugars and biofuels at biorefineries as compared to more conventional IL conversion technologies.

According to solution chemistry and XRD patterns, di-sodium tetraborate decahydrate (borax) dissolves congruently, and is the sole solubility-controlling phase, in a 0.01 mol/kg MgCl<sub>2</sub> solution: Na<sub>2</sub>B<sub>4</sub>O<sub>7</sub>•10H<sub>2</sub>O(cr) ⇌ 2Na<sup>+</sup> + 4B(OH)<sub>4</sub> + 2H<sup>+</sup> + H<sub>2</sub>O(l). However, in a 0.1 mol/kg MgCl<sub>2</sub> solution borax dissolves incongruently and is in equilibrium with di-sodium hexaborate tetrahydrate: 2Na<sub>2</sub>B<sub>6</sub>O<sub>10</sub>•4H<sub>2</sub>O(cr) + 2Na<sup>+</sup> + 23H<sub>2</sub>O(l) ⇌ 3Na<sub>2</sub>B<sub>4</sub>O<sub>7</sub>•10H<sub>2</sub>O(cr) + 2H<sup>+</sup>. In this study, the equilibrium constant (log K<sup>0</sup>) for Reaction 2 at 25 °C and infinite dilution was determined to be –16.44 ± 0.13 (2σ) based on the experimental data and the Pitzer model for calculations of activity coefficients of aqueous species. In accordance with the log K<sup>0</sup> for Reaction 1 from a previous publication from this research group, and log K<sup>0</sup> for Reaction 2 from this study, the equilibrium constant for dissolution of di-sodium hexaborate tetrahydrate at 25 °C and at infinite dilution, Na<sub>2</sub>B<sub>6</sub>O<sub>10</sub>•4H<sub>2</sub>O(cr) + 10H<sub>2</sub>O(l) ⇌ 2Na<sup>+</sup> + 6B(OH)<sub>4</sub><sup>-</sup> + 4H<sup>+</sup> was derived to be –45.42 ± 0.16 (2σ). The equilibrium constants determined in this study can find applications in many fields. For example, in the field of nuclear waste management, the formation of di-sodium hexaborate tetrahydrate in brines containing magnesium will decrease borate concentrations, making less borate available for interactions with Am(III). In the field of experimental investigations, based on the equilibrium constant for Reaction 2, the experimental systems can be controlled in terms of acidity around neutral pH by using the equilibrium assemblage of borax and di-sodium hexaborate tetrahydrate at 25 °C. As salt lakes and natural brines contain both borate and magnesium as well as sodium, the formation of sodium hexaborate tetrahydrate may influence the chemical evolution of salt lakes and natural brines. Di-sodium hexaborate tetrahydrate is a polymorph of the mineral ameghinite [chemical formula Na<sub>2</sub>B<sub>6</sub>O<sub>10</sub>•4H<sub>2</sub>O; structural formula NaB<sub>3</sub>O<sub>3</sub>(OH)<sub>4</sub> or Na<sub>2</sub>B<sub>6</sub>O<sub>6</sub>(OH)<sub>8</sub>]. Finally, di-sodium hexaborate tetrahydrate could be a precursor of ameghinite and could be transformed when borate deposits are subject to diagenesis.","","","Sandia National Lab.

Savings increase to about $2 trillion if: losses beyond 50 miles are included; the land-contamination threshold for long-term population relocation is changed to that used for the Chernobyl and Fukushima accidents and recommended by the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency; and, based on the experience of Japan, decontamination of land areas to levels acceptable for population return is assumed to take at least four years.

Key thermal properties (heat capacity, thermal diffusivity, and thermal conductivity) of representative high-level and low-activity waste glasses were studied as functions of temperature in the range of 200 to 800°C (relevant to the cooling process), implementing simultaneous differential scanning calorimetry-thermal gravimetry (DSC-TGA), Xe-flash diffusivity, pycnometry, and dilatometry. The study showed that simultaneous DSC-TGA would be a reliable method to obtain heat capacity of various glasses at the temperature of interest. Accurate thermal properties from this study were shown to provide a more realistic guideline for capacity and time constraint of heat removal process, in comparison to the design basis conservative engineering estimates. The estimates, though useful for design in the absence measured physical properties, can now be supplanted and the measured thermal properties can be used in design verification activities.","American Ceramic Society","","Pacific Northwest National Lab.

While uncontrolled crystallization in nuclear-waste glasses is problematic, chemically durable glass-ceramics with significantly high waste loadings can be produced with controlled crystallization of glasses. This article presents an overview of various aspects of nuclear-waste glasses where crystallization is either considered to be advantageous or problematic.

The major conclusion is that Fickian diffusion may be accurate enough for deionized water leaching, but electro-diffusion should be considered in the reactive solute transport modeling of ammonium nitrate decalcification and in the degradation modeling of cementitious materials exposed to nuclear waste form solutions.","","Available from http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.cemconres.2017.06.002","","","","United States","2017-10-15T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: Cement and Concrete Research; Journal Volume: 100; Other Information: Copyright (c) 2017 Elsevier Science B.V., Amsterdam, The Netherlands, All rights reserved.; Country of input: International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA)","","Medium: X; Size: page(s) 227-244","","","","Journal ID: ISSN 0008-8846; CODEN: CCNRAI; PII: S0008-8846(16)30218-6; TRN: US17R3230051313","10.1016/J.CEMCONRES.2017.06.002","","2018-07-20T00:00:00Z","22701576","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/22701576","","Cement and Concrete Research","","100"
"Development of a new approach based on midwave infrared spectroscopy for post-consumer black plastic waste sorting in the recycling industry","Rozenstein, Offer; Puckrin, Eldon; Adamowski, Jan","37 INORGANIC, ORGANIC, PHYSICAL AND ANALYTICAL CHEMISTRY; 12 MANAGEMENT OF RADIOACTIVE WASTES, AND NON-RADIOACTIVE WASTES FROM NUCLEAR FACILITIES; ABSORPTION SPECTROSCOPY; INFRARED SPECTRA; POLYETHYLENE TEREPHTHALATE; RECYCLING; SIGNAL-TO-NOISE RATIO; SORTING; WASTES; WOOD","Highlights: • MWIR reflectance contact measurements were performed on post-consumer waste. • MWIR absorptions are found to be potentially suitable for black plastic resin classification. • MWIR is also potentially suitable for separation of coloured plastic and wood based products. • Atmospheric transmittance simulations suggest feasibility of stand-off measurements. - Abstract: Waste sorting is key to the process of waste recycling. Exact identification of plastic resin and wood products using Near Infrared (NIR, 1–1.7 µm) sensing is currently in use. Yet, dark targets characterized by low reflectance, such as black plastics, are hard to identify by this method. Following the recent success of Midwave Infrared (MWIR, 3–12 µm) measurements to identify coloured plastic polymers, the aim of this study was to assess whether this technique is applicable to sorting black plastic polymers and wood products. We performed infrared reflectance contact measurements of 234 plastic samples and 29 samples of wood and paper products. Plastic samples included black, coloured and transparent Polyethylene Terephthalate (PET), Polyethylene (PE), Polyvinyl Chloride (PVC), Polypropylene (PP), Polylactic acid (PLA) and Polystyrene (PS). The spectral signatures of the black and coloured plastic samples were compared with clear plastic samples and signatures documented in the literature to identify the polymer spectral features in the presence of coloured material. This information was used to determine the spectral bands that best suit the sorting of black plastic polymers. The main NIR-MWIR absorption features of wood, cardboard and paper were identified as well according to the spectral measurements. Good agreement was found between our measurements and the absorption features documented in the literature. The new approach using MWIR spectral features appears to be useful for black plastics as it overcomes some of the limitations in the NIR region to identify them. The main limitation of this technique for industrial applications is the trade-off between the signal-to-noise ratio of the sensor operating in standoff mode and the speed at which waste is moved under the sensor. This limitation can be resolved by reducing the system’s spectral resolution to 16 cm{sup −1}, which allows for faster spectra acquisition while maintaining a reasonable signal-to-noise ratio.","","Available from http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.wasman.2017.07.023","","","","United States","2017-10-15T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: Waste Management; Journal Volume: 68; Other Information: Copyright (c) 2017 Elsevier Science B.V., Amsterdam, The Netherlands, All rights reserved.; Country of input: International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA)","","Medium: X; Size: page(s) 38-44","","","","Journal ID: ISSN 0956-053X; CODEN: WAMAE2; PII: S0956-053X(17)30516-0; TRN: US17R4386093073","10.1016/J.WASMAN.2017.07.023","","2019-03-08T00:00:00Z","22742129","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/22742129","","Waste Management","","68"

One option is to mix digestate with fresh and/or stabilized organic waste and then feed to the composting process. In this study, the effect of co-composting anaerobic digestate (in different quantities) on a composting process was investigated. The digestate was prepared in a pilot-scale 500 L high solids dry anaerobic digester and composting was completed in eight 25 L reactors with different ratios of digestate to fresh feedstock from the organic fraction of municipal solid waste (OFMSW). The digestate constituted 0, 10, 20, 30, 40, 50, 75, or 100% (wet mass) of the feedstock. The co-composting experiment was conducted in two phases: active aeration and curing. Monitored parameters included: process temperature, aeration rate, oxygen concentration of the outlet gas, mass changes, total solids, organic matter, pH, and electrical conductivity. In addition, respirometry, C:N ratio, ammonium to nitrate ratio, and Solvita® tests were used to quantify stability and maturity end points. The results showed that the addition of digestate to the OFMSW increased composting reaction rates in all cases, with peak performance occurring within the ratio of 20–40% of digestate addition on a wet weight basis. Reactor performance may have been influenced by the high total ammonia nitrogen (TAN) levels in the digestate. Composting rates increased as TAN levels increased up to 5000 TAN mg kg{sup −1} DM; however, TAN may have become inhibitory at higher levels.","","Available from http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.wasman.2017.07.018","","","","United States","2017-10-15T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: Waste Management; Journal Volume: 68; Other Information: Copyright (c) 2017 Elsevier Science B.V., Amsterdam, The Netherlands, All rights reserved.; Country of input: International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA)","","Medium: X; Size: page(s) 74-84","","","","Journal ID: ISSN 0956-053X; CODEN: WAMAE2; PII: S0956-053X(17)30510-X; TRN: US17R4388093075","10.1016/J.WASMAN.2017.07.018","","2019-03-08T00:00:00Z","22742131","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/22742131","","Waste Management","","68"

These assays were divided into two groups, in which different conditions were applied. Group I investigated the variation in two operational parameters, i.e. the organic loading rate (OLR) and the hydraulic retention time (HRT), while in Group II, the assays were fed with different substrates in a sequential order. Results showed more elevated specific methane yields for co-digestion assays compared with mono-digestion assays. Maximum yields were achieved at an OLR of 1.0 gVS/(L·d) and a HRT reduced to half of the initial. Further reduction of the HRT coupled to an increase of the OLR generally caused a significant decrease of specific methane yields, as well as one case of severe overloading, i.e. the mono-digestion of juice industry waste, which resulted in instability and ultimately system failure. Sequential feeding with different substrates led to a more equilibrated operation, especially for co-digestion systems, with higher specific methane yields being observed during the phases corresponding to winery waste and juice industry waste substrates. Overall more positive results were obtained in the cases in which the latter substrates were fed to the reactors at process startup.","","Available from http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.wasman.2017.06.026","","","","United States","2017-10-15T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: Waste Management; Journal Volume: 68; Other Information: Copyright (c) 2017 Elsevier Science B.V., Amsterdam, The Netherlands, All rights reserved.; Country of input: International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA)","","Medium: X; Size: page(s) 103-119","","","","Journal ID: ISSN 0956-053X; CODEN: WAMAE2; PII: S0956-053X(17)30468-3; TRN: US17R4391093076","10.1016/J.WASMAN.2017.06.026","","2019-03-08T00:00:00Z","22742132","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/22742132","","Waste Management","","68"

The option of co-digestion with vinasse, main liquid waste generated from ethanol production, was investigated under batch regime at mesophilic conditions (37.5 ± 1 °C) and the best mixture was evaluated under semicontinuous regime in stirred-tank reactors. The maximum values for methane yield in batch tests were for V{sub 75}/P{sub 25} and V{sub 50}/P{sub 50} mixtures (on basis of the chemical oxygen demand (COD) percentage added in the mixture), with an average value of 246 N mL CH{sub 4} g{sup −1} COD{sub fed}, which was 13% higher than that of press mud alone.

However, the heating values change widely and frequently, while there is no reliable real-time instrument to measure heating values in the process of incinerating municipal solid waste. A rapid, cost-effective, and comparative methodology was proposed to evaluate the heating values of burning MSW online based on prior knowledge, expert experience, and data-mining techniques. First, selecting the input variables of the model by analyzing the operational mechanism of circulating fluidized bed incinerators, and the corresponding heating value was classified into one of nine fuzzy expressions according to expert advice. Development of prediction models by employing four different nonlinear models was undertaken, including a multilayer perceptron neural network, a support vector machine, an adaptive neuro-fuzzy inference system, and a random forest; a series of optimization schemes were implemented simultaneously in order to improve the performance of each model. Finally, a comprehensive comparison study was carried out to evaluate the performance of the models. Results indicate that the adaptive neuro-fuzzy inference system model outperforms the other three models, with the random forest model performing second-best, and the multilayer perceptron model performing at the worst level. A model with sufficient accuracy would contribute adequately to the control of circulating fluidized bed incinerator operation and provide reliable heating value signals for an automatic combustion control system.","","Available from http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.wasman.2017.03.044","","","","United States","2017-10-15T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: Waste Management; Journal Volume: 68; Other Information: Copyright (c) 2017 Elsevier Science B.V., Amsterdam, The Netherlands, All rights reserved.; Country of input: International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA)","","Medium: X; Size: page(s) 186-197","","","","Journal ID: ISSN 0956-053X; CODEN: WAMAE2; PII: S0956-053X(17)30190-3; TRN: US17R4396093079","10.1016/J.WASMAN.2017.03.044","","2019-03-08T00:00:00Z","22742135","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/22742135","","Waste Management","","68"

Local authorities commonly dispose of this waste by either landfill or incineration which are both unsustainable practices. Disposing of organic wastes via these routes is also becoming increasingly expensive due to rising landfill taxes and transport costs. The Thermo-Catalytic Reforming (TCR®) process, is a proposed valorisation route to transform organic wastes and residues, such as MSW, into sustainable energy vectors including (H{sub 2} rich synthesis gas, liquid bio-oil and solid char). The aim herein, was to investigate the conversion of the organic fraction of MSW into fuels and chemicals utilising the TCR technology in a 2 kg/h continuous pilot scale reactor. Findings show that MSW was successfully processed with the TCR after carrying out a feedstock pre-treatment step. Approximately, 25 wt.% of the feedstock was converted into phase separated liquids, composed of 19 wt.% aqueous phase and 6 wt.% organic phase bio-oil. The analysis of the bio-oil fraction revealed physical and chemical fuel properties, higher heating value (HHV) of 38 MJ/kg, oxygen content <7 wt.% and water content <4 wt.%. Due to the bio-oil’s chemical and physical properties, the bio-oil was found to be directly miscible with fossil diesel when blended at a volume ratio of 50:50. The mass balance closure was 44 wt.% synthesis gas, with a H{sub 2} content of 36 vol% and HHV of 17.23 MJ/Nm{sup 3}, and 31 wt.% char with a HHV of 17 MJ/kg. The production of high quantities of H{sub 2} gas and highly de-oxygenated organic liquids makes downstream hydrogen separation and subsequent hydro-deoxygenation of the produced bio-oil a promising upgrading step to achieve drop-in transportation fuels from MSW.","","Available from http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.wasman.2017.06.044","","","","United States","2017-10-15T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: Waste Management; Journal Volume: 68; Other Information: Copyright (c) 2017 Elsevier Science B.V., Amsterdam, The Netherlands, All rights reserved.; Country of input: International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA)","","Medium: X; Size: page(s) 198-206","","","","Journal ID: ISSN 0956-053X; CODEN: WAMAE2; PII: S0956-053X(17)30485-3; TRN: US17R4397093080","10.1016/J.WASMAN.2017.06.044","","2019-03-08T00:00:00Z","22742136","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/22742136","","Waste Management","","68"

The test was conducted using the 240 g-ton centrifuge at the University of California at Davis under the U.S. National Science Foundation Network for Earthquake Engineering Simulation Research (NEESR) program. A 0.05 mm thin film membrane was used to model the liner. The waste was modeled using a peat-sand mixture. The side slope membrane was underlain by lubricated low density polyethylene to maximize the difference between the interface shear strength on the top and bottom of the geomembrane and the induced tension in it. Instrumentation included thin film strain gages to monitor geomembrane strains and accelerometers to monitor seismic excitation. The model was subjected to an input design motion intended to simulate strong ground motion from the 1994 Hyogo-ken Nanbu earthquake. Results indicate that downdrag waste settlement and seismic loading together, and possibly each phenomenon individually, can induce potentially damaging tensile strains in geomembrane liners.

In this study, we focused on the formation and emission of MM in four lab-scaled simulated landfill reactors running in different operation modes, namely, R1 and R2, without leachate recirculation, running under anaerobic and semi-aerobic atmosphere, R3 and R4, with leachate recirculation, running under anaerobic and semi-aerobic atmosphere, respectively. From the perspective of odor abatement, the semi-aerobic operation mode can efficiently lower the emitted MM concentration by 87.4–94.9%, relative to the semi-aerobic operation mode. Furthermore, under semi-aerobic conditions, leachate recirculation substantially shortened the period of MM influence by 12.7%, thus reducing the risk of affecting the surrounding atmospheric environment. The formation of MM was dependent on the characteristics such as the volatile fatty acid concentration and chemical oxygen demand in the leachate and sulfide concentration of the refuse. Overall, MM release can be effectively controlled with semi-aerobic operation mode and leachate recirculation.","","Available from http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.wasman.2017.07.013","","","","United States","2017-10-15T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: Waste Management; Journal Volume: 68; Other Information: Copyright (c) 2017 Elsevier Science B.V., Amsterdam, The Netherlands, All rights reserved.; Country of input: International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA)","","Medium: X; Size: page(s) 337-343","","","","Journal ID: ISSN 0956-053X; CODEN: WAMAE2; PII: S0956-053X(17)30505-6; TRN: US17R4400093082","10.1016/J.WASMAN.2017.07.013","","2019-03-08T00:00:00Z","22742138","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/22742138","","Waste Management","","68"

Pyrolysis represents a potential waste management solution, whereby the solid carbonaceous residue is heated in the absence of oxygen to produce liquid and gaseous fuels, and a solid char. The design of an efficient conversion unit requires information on the reaction kinetics of pyrolysis. This work is the first to probe the appropriate reaction model of waste tire pyrolysis. The average activation energy of pyrolysis was determined via iso-conversional methods over a mass fraction conversion range between 0.20 and 0.80 to be 162.8 ± 23.2 kJ mol{sup −1}. Using the Master Plots method, a reaction order of three was found to be the most suitable model to describe the pyrolytic decomposition. This suggests that the chemical reactions themselves (cracking, depolymerization, etc.), not diffusion or boundary layer interactions common with carbonaceous biomasses, are the rate-limiting steps in the pyrolytic decomposition of waste tires.","","Available from http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.wasman.2017.06.006","","","","United States","2017-10-15T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: Waste Management; Journal Volume: 68; Other Information: Copyright (c) 2017 Elsevier Science B.V., Amsterdam, The Netherlands, All rights reserved.; Country of input: International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA)","","Medium: X; Size: page(s) 405-411","","","","Journal ID: ISSN 0956-053X; CODEN: WAMAE2; PII: S0956-053X(17)30445-2; TRN: US17R4403093084","10.1016/J.WASMAN.2017.06.006","","2019-03-08T00:00:00Z","22742140","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/22742140","","Waste Management","","68"

This paper investigates the potential of applying Internet of Things (IoT) and Big Data as the solutions to the WEEE management problems. The massive data generated during the production, consumption and disposal of Electrical and Electronic Equipment (EEE) fits the characteristics of Big Data. Through using the state-of-the-art communication technologies, the IoT derives the WEEE “Big Data” from the life cycle of EEE, and the Big Data technologies process the WEEE “Big Data” for supporting decision making in WEEE management.

Life Cycle Assessment (LCA) was employed to evaluate five advanced management systems represent state-of-the-art treatment technologies, including sanitary landfilling; proper recycling of metals, materials, and precious metals (PMs); and incineration of plastic and the hazardous portion of printed circuit boards (PCBs). Six e-waste products that contribute the most to the e-waste in Jordan were included in the assessment of each scenario, which resulted in 30 total cases of e-waste management. The findings indicated that landfills for the entire components of the e-waste stream are the worst option and should be avoided. The most promising e-waste management scenario features integrated e-waste processes based on the concept of Integrated Waste Management (IWM), including recycling materials such as non-PMs and PMs, incinerating plastic and the hazardous content of PCBs using the energy recovered from incineration, and using sanitary landfills of residues. For this scenario, the best environmental performance was obtained for the treatment of mobile phones. Incineration of the portion of hazardous waste using energy recovery is an option that deserves attention. Because scenario implementation depends on more than just the environmental benefits (e.g., economic cost and technical aspects), the study proposes a systematic approach founded on the IWM concept for e-waste management scenario selection.","","Available from http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.wasman.2017.06.038","","","","United States","2017-10-15T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: Waste Management; Journal Volume: 68; Other Information: Copyright (c) 2017 Elsevier Science B.V., Amsterdam, The Netherlands, All rights reserved.; Country of input: International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA)","","Medium: X; Size: page(s) 458-474","","","","Journal ID: ISSN 0956-053X; CODEN: WAMAE2; PII: S0956-053X(17)30479-8; TRN: US17R4405093086","10.1016/J.WASMAN.2017.06.038","","2019-03-08T00:00:00Z","22742142","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/22742142","","Waste Management","","68"

In this study we demonstrated the use of laser to strip the covering soldering mask on PCB’s, thus exposing the copper underneath so that extraction techniques may take place. Using a Q-Switched Nd:YAG laser operating at 1064 nm and 532 nm we tested the procedure under different energy conditions. The laser stripping of the soldering mask was achieved with satisfactory results by irradiation with 225 mJ at 1064 nm. However, when using similar parameters at 532 nm the process of the coating ejection was not promoted properly, leading to a faulty detachment. Infrared laser PCB stripping presents itself to be technically viable and environmental friendly, since it uses no chemicals inputs, offering one more option to WEEE treatment and recycling.","","Available from http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.wasman.2017.07.019","","","","United States","2017-10-15T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: Waste Management; Journal Volume: 68; Other Information: Copyright (c) 2017 Elsevier Science B.V., Amsterdam, The Netherlands, All rights reserved.; Country of input: International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA)","","Medium: X; Size: page(s) 475-481","","","","Journal ID: ISSN 0956-053X; CODEN: WAMAE2; PII: S0956-053X(17)30511-1; TRN: US17R4406093087","10.1016/J.WASMAN.2017.07.019","","2019-03-08T00:00:00Z","22742143","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/22742143","","Waste Management","","68"

They are a key component in the most energy efficient electric motors and generators, thus, they are vital for energy technologies, industrial applications and automation, and future forms of mobility. Rare earth elements (REEs) such as neodymium, dysprosium and praseodymium are also found in waste electrical and electronic equipment (WEEE) in volumes that grow with the technological evolution, and are marked as critical elements by the European Commission due to their high economic importance combined with significant supply risks. Recycling could be a good approach to compensate for the lack of rare earths (REs) on the market. However, less than 1% of REs are currently being recycled, mainly because of non-existing collection logistics, lack of information about the quantity of RE materials available for recycling and recycling-unfriendly product designs. To improve these lack of information, different waste streams of electrical and electronic equipment from an industrial recycling plant were analyzed in order to localize, identify and collect RE permanent magnets of the Nd-Fe-B type. This particular type of magnets were mainly found in hard disk drives (HDDs) from laptops and desktop computers, as well as in loudspeakers from compact products such as flat screen TVs, PC screens, and laptops. Since HDDs have been investigated thoroughly by many authors, this study focusses on other potential Nd-Fe-B resources in electronic waste. The study includes a systematic survey of the chemical composition of the Nd-Fe-B magnets found in the selected waste streams, which illustrates the evolution of the Nd-Fe-B alloys over the years. The study also provides an overview over the types of magnets integrated in different waste electric and electronic equipment.","","Available from http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.wasman.2017.07.028","","","","United States","2017-10-15T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: Waste Management; Journal Volume: 68; Other Information: Copyright (c) 2017 Elsevier Science B.V., Amsterdam, The Netherlands, All rights reserved.; Country of input: International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA)","","Medium: X; Size: page(s) 482-489","","","","Journal ID: ISSN 0956-053X; CODEN: WAMAE2; PII: S0956-053X(17)30521-4; TRN: US17R4407093088","10.1016/J.WASMAN.2017.07.028","","2019-03-08T00:00:00Z","22742144","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/22742144","","Waste Management","","68"

Both flame-retardant plastic housing materials and printed circuit boards (PCBs) could be the major contributors. However, relatively little work has focused on the use or content of toxic substances and their changing in scrap housing materials and PCBs from home appliances. This study evaluated the existence of brominated flame retardants (BFRs, including polybrominated diphenyl ethers (PBDEs) and Tetrabromobisphenol-A (TBBPA)) in housing plastics and PCBs from home appliances collected from various e-waste recyclers in China. These were then analyzed for the potential migration of BFRs from the e-waste components into their recycled products. The results show that both PBDEs and TBBPA were found with high level in most of e-waste samples, indicating that the widespread use of BFRs in home appliances are entering into the end-of-life stage. For the plastics samples, CRT TVs and LCD monitors should be given priority for the control of BFRs. Regarding PBDEs, the dominant congeners of BDE-209 in the plastics samples contributed 90.72–93.54% to the total concentrations of PBDEs, yet there are large variations for PCBs samples: BDE-28, -47, -99, and -153 were also important congeners compositions, except for BDE-209. Compared with previous studies, the BFRs concentrations in current Chinese e-waste are trending to decline. This study also found that BFRs in housing plastics and PCBs will be transferred into the recycled products with other purpose use, and the new products could have highly enriched capacities for BFRs. The obtained results could be helpful to manage e-waste and their components properly in order to minimize associated environmental and health risks of BFRs, particularly for their further reuse.","","Available from http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.wasman.2017.07.033","","","","United States","2017-10-15T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: Waste Management; Journal Volume: 68; Other Information: Copyright (c) 2017 Elsevier Science B.V., Amsterdam, The Netherlands, All rights reserved.; Country of input: International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA)","","Medium: X; Size: page(s) 498-507","","","","Journal ID: ISSN 0956-053X; CODEN: WAMAE2; PII: S0956-053X(17)30525-1; TRN: US17R4409093090","10.1016/J.WASMAN.2017.07.033","","2019-03-08T00:00:00Z","22742146","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/22742146","","Waste Management","","68"

The effect of different cooling rates on the properties of pyrolysis residue, manganese oxide particles, were also investigated. Morphological and structural characterization of the produced Zn particles were performed. The battery black mass was characterized with respect to the properties and chemical composition of the waste battery particles. The thermodynamics of the pyrolysis process was studied using the HSC Chemistry 5.11 software. A hydrogen reduction reaction of the battery black mass (washed with Milli-Q water) takes place at the chosen temperature and makes it possible to produce fine Zn particles by rapid condensation following the evaporation of Zn from the pyrolysis batch. The amount of Zn that can be separated from the black mass increases by extending the residence time. Recovery of 99.8% of the Zn was achieved at 950 °C for 60 min residence time using 1.0 L/min gas flow rate. The pyrolysis residue contains MnO and Mn{sub 2}O{sub 3} compounds, and the oxidation state of manganese can be controlled by cooling rate and atmosphere. The Zn particles exhibit spherical and hexagonal particle morphology with a particle size varying between 200 nm and 3 µm.

Using H{sub 2}SO{sub 4} as solvent and selecting appropriate conditions of temperature and concentration, all residues were dissolved except carbon. The separation and recovery of the two components were performed by electrodeposition with satisfactory results at pH values above 4 (current efficiency above 70% for Zn and Mn) but rather lower efficiencies as the pH decreased. Most of the Zn was selectively dissolved by alkaline leaching using a 6.5 M NaOH solution, and its recovery was examined by means of both electrochemical and chemical processes. The expected formation of pure Zn by electrowinning failed due to the formation of ZnO, the content of which was highly dependent on the electrodeposition time. For short periods, Zn was the main component. For longer periods the electrodeposit consisted of agglomerated microparticles of ZnO with a minor fraction of Zn metal (barely 3% as measured by X-ray diffraction). A chemical reaction of the element with oxygen released at the anode surface might be responsible for its conversion to ZnO. A simple chemical route is described for the first time for the direct conversion of Zn(OH){sub 4}{sup 2−} solution to nanostructured ZnO by lowering the pH to values around 12 using 2 M HCl solution.","","Available from http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.wasman.2017.06.048","","","","United States","2017-10-15T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: Waste Management; Journal Volume: 68; Other Information: Copyright (c) 2017 Elsevier Science B.V., Amsterdam, The Netherlands, All rights reserved.; Country of input: International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA)","","Medium: X; Size: page(s) 518-526","","","","Journal ID: ISSN 0956-053X; CODEN: WAMAE2; PII: S0956-053X(17)30489-0; TRN: US17R4411093092","10.1016/J.WASMAN.2017.06.048","","2019-03-08T00:00:00Z","22742148","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/22742148","","Waste Management","","68"

While OCPs tend to focus on infrastructure, they often overlook the linchpin role that household behavior change plays in the success of OCPs. The current research used a longitudinal field experiment (n=370) to test both the effectiveness of a new curbside OCP and new social innovations intended to stimulate pro-environmental changes in household behavior. The findings suggest greater participation levels occur by implementing both new supportive infrastructure (i.e., curbside carts and collection services), and innovations that target the social aspects of waste (i.e., communicating social norms of separation). The data also provide an opportunity to test new model for predicting the most efficacious behavior-change interventions based on population profiles. The results provide some support for the model; reducing barriers (i.e., curbside carts and collection) tends to help all population profiles, but norm communication increases participation more for the hypothesized profile than for other sub-groups.","","Available from http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.wasman.2017.07.010","","","","United States","2017-10-15T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: Waste Management; Journal Volume: 68; Other Information: Copyright (c) 2017 Elsevier Science B.V., Amsterdam, The Netherlands, All rights reserved.; Country of input: International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA)","","Medium: X; Size: page(s) 571-580","","","","Journal ID: ISSN 0956-053X; CODEN: WAMAE2; PII: S0956-053X(17)30502-0; TRN: US17R4415093096","10.1016/J.WASMAN.2017.07.010","","2019-03-08T00:00:00Z","22742152","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/22742152","","Waste Management","","68"

Although many grape-based food products can be found in the market, studies have shown that around 75% of the world grape production is destined for the wine industry. Grape pomace is an abundant by-product from the wine industry, which consists of the remaining skin, seeds and stalks and represents around 25% of total grape weight used in the winemaking process. In countries such as Italy, France and Spain, where wine production is more relevant, the annual grape pomace generation can reach nearly 1200 tonnes per year. In order to reach a sustainable winemaking process there is a need of a waste reduction policy. Several studies explore this subject using grape pomace as a source of healthy and technological compounds that could be applied in animal feed, pharmaceutical, cosmetic or food industry to improve stability and nutritional characteristics, and in cosmetic industry, where grape seeds oil is widely used. This review aims to approach the recent winemaking scenario and the benefits achieved when a waste management policy is implemented, as well as to compare available extractive technologies and a wide alternative of uses for grape pomace.","","Available from http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.wasman.2017.07.017","","","","United States","2017-10-15T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: Waste Management; Journal Volume: 68; Other Information: Copyright (c) 2017 Elsevier Science B.V., Amsterdam, The Netherlands, All rights reserved.; Country of input: International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA)","","Medium: X; Size: page(s) 581-594","","","","Journal ID: ISSN 0956-053X; CODEN: WAMAE2; PII: S0956-053X(17)30509-3; TRN: US17R4416093097","10.1016/J.WASMAN.2017.07.017","","2019-03-08T00:00:00Z","22742153","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/22742153","","Waste Management","","68"

Among all the pollutants emitted from manure waste, ammonia is of greatest concern as it could contribute to formation of aerosols in the air and could hardly be controlled by traditional disposal methods like landfill or composting. On the other hand, manure waste is also a renewable source for energy production. In this work, an environmental friendly animal waste disposal process with combined ammonia recovery and energy production was proposed and investigated both experimentally and economically. Lab-scale feasibility study results showed that 70% of ammonia in the manure waste could be converted to struvite as fertilizer, while solid manure waste was successfully gasified in a 10 kW downdraft fixed-bed gasifier producing syngas with the higher heating value of 4.9 MJ/(N m{sup 3}). Based on experimental results, economic study for the system was carried out using a cost-benefit analysis to investigate the financial feasibility based on a Singapore case study. In addition, for comparison, schemes of gasification without ammonia removal and incineration were also studied for manure waste disposal. The results showed that the proposed gasification-based manure waste treatment process integrated with ammonia recovery was most financially viable.","","Available from http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.wasman.2017.07.027","","","","United States","2017-10-15T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: Waste Management; Journal Volume: 68; Other Information: Copyright (c) 2017 Elsevier Science B.V., Amsterdam, The Netherlands, All rights reserved.; Country of input: International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA)","","Medium: X; Size: page(s) 636-645","","","","Journal ID: ISSN 0956-053X; CODEN: WAMAE2; PII: S0956-053X(17)30520-2; TRN: US17R4418093099","10.1016/J.WASMAN.2017.07.027","","2019-03-08T00:00:00Z","22742155","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/22742155","","Waste Management","","68"

The levels of toxic polychlorinated dibenzo-p-dioxins (PCDD) and dibenzofurans (PCDF) contained in emission from the torrefaction process were evaluated. In addition, main ash-forming elements and trace metals in the raw feedstock and char were determined. The use of MSW in fuel blends with DC resulted in lower PCDD and PCDF emissions after torrefaction, compared with the RDF blends. The migration of chlorine from the feedstock to the gas phase reduces the chlorine content of the char which may reduce the risk of alkali chloride-corrosion in char combustion. However, trace metals catalytically active in the formation of PCDD and PCDF remain in the char, thereby may promote PCDD and PCDF formation during subsequent char combustion for energy recovery; this formation is less extensive than when the feedstock is used.","","Available from http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.wasman.2017.06.017","","","","United States","2017-10-15T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: Waste Management; Journal Volume: 68; Journal Issue: Complete; Other Information: Copyright (c) 2017 Elsevier Science B.V., Amsterdam, The Netherlands, All rights reserved.; Country of input: International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA)","","Medium: X; Size: page(s) 646-652","","","","Journal ID: ISSN 0956-053X; CODEN: WAMAE2; PII: S0956-053X(17)30458-0; TRN: US17R4419093100","10.1016/J.WASMAN.2017.06.017","","2019-03-08T00:00:00Z","22742156","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/22742156","","Waste Management","Complete","68"

To identify the GHG emissions from waste management in China, the characteristics of MSW and the current and future treatment management strategies, five typical management scenarios were modeled by EaseTech software following the principles of life cycle inventory and analyzed based on the carbon and energy flows. Due to the high organic fraction (50–70%) and moisture content (>50%) of Chinese municipal solid waste (MSW), the net GHG emissions in waste management had a significant difference from the developed countries. It was found that the poor landfill gas (LFG) collection efficiency and low carbon storage resulted landfilling with flaring and landfilling with biogas recovery scenarios were the largest GHG emissions (192 and 117 kgCO{sub 2}-Eq/t, respectively). In contrast, incineration had the best energy recovery rate (19%), and, by grid emissions substitution, led to a substantial decrease in net GHG emissions (−124 kgCO{sub 2}-Eq/t). Due to the high energy consumption in operation, the unavoidable leakage of CH{sub 4} and N{sub 2}O in treatment, and the further release of CH{sub 4} in disposing of the digested residue or composted product, the scenarios with biological treatment of the organic fractions after sorting, such as composting or anaerobic digestion (AD), did not lead to the outstanding GHG reductions (emissions of 32 and −36 kgCO{sub 2}-Eq/t, respectively) as expected.","","Available from http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.wasman.2017.06.020","","","","United States","2017-10-15T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: Waste Management; Journal Volume: 68; Other Information: Copyright (c) 2017 Elsevier Science B.V., Amsterdam, The Netherlands, All rights reserved.; Country of input: International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA)","","Medium: X; Size: page(s) 653-661","","","","Journal ID: ISSN 0956-053X; CODEN: WAMAE2; PII: S0956-053X(17)30461-0; TRN: US17R4420093101","10.1016/J.WASMAN.2017.06.020","","2019-03-08T00:00:00Z","22742157","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/22742157","","Waste Management","","68"

The facility includes a mechanical sorting platform for the production of a solid recovered fuel (SRF) utilized in an external waste-to-energy plant, bio-cells for tunnel composting of organic fraction, and a sanitary landfill for the safe disposal of ultimate waste. All the MRF sub-units have been analysed in depth in order to acquire reliable data for a life cycle assessment study, focused on the environmental performances of different configurations of the facility. The study investigated a “past” configuration, including just mechanical sorting, landfilling and biogas combustion in a gas engine, and the “present” one, which includes also a composting unit. Two possible “future” configurations, having a gasifier inside the MRF battery limits, have been also analysed, assessing the performances of two fluidized bed reactors of different size, able to gasify only the residues generated by the sorting platform or the whole amount of produced SRF, respectively. The analysis evaluated the contributions of each unit in the different configurations and allowed a reliable assessment of the technological evolution of the facility. The results quantified the positive effect of the inclusion of an aerobic treatment of the waste organic fraction. The SRF gasification in situ appears to improve the MRF environmental performances in all the impact categories, with the exclusion of that of global warming.","","Available from http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.wasman.2017.05.039","","","","United States","2017-10-15T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: Waste Management; Journal Volume: 68; Other Information: Copyright (c) 2017 Elsevier Science B.V., Amsterdam, The Netherlands, All rights reserved.; Country of input: International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA)","","Medium: X; Size: page(s) 662-676","","","","Journal ID: ISSN 0956-053X; CODEN: WAMAE2; PII: S0956-053X(17)30366-5; TRN: US17R4421093102","10.1016/J.WASMAN.2017.05.039","","2019-03-08T00:00:00Z","22742158","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/22742158","","Waste Management","","68"

A case study was conducted on combustibles, which is a type of disaster waste derived from dwellings, in Mie Prefecture, Japan. First, we calculated the quantity and the spatial distribution of disaster waste derived from dwellings and tsunami debris produced as a result of a large-scale earthquake. The quantity of disaster waste was estimated as 7,178,000 t with functioning flood-preventing facilities and 11,956,000 t without functioning flood prevention facilities. Ensuring resilience in the face of earthquakes and tsunamis by renovating flood-preventing facilities is extremely important in decreasing the production of wastes, especially in coastal regions. Next, the transportation network for transporting combustibles in disaster waste to temporary storage sites, incineration plants, and landfill was constructed using an optimization model. The results showed that if flood-preventing facilities do not function properly, the installation of temporary incineration facilities becomes essential. Life-cycle emissions of CO{sub 2}, SO{sub x}, NO{sub x}, and PM and the costs of removal, storage, and treatment of combustibles were calculated as 258,000 t, 618 t, 1705 t, 7.9 t, and 246 million USD, respectively, in the case of functioning flood-preventing facilities. If flood-preventing facilities do not function, the quantity of environmentally unfriendly emissions and the costs increase. This result suggested the significance of renovation in order to maintain the conditions of flood-preventing facilities to decrease the environmental burden and costs as well as keep the production of disaster waste at a minimum.","","Available from http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.wasman.2017.06.014","","","","United States","2017-10-15T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: Waste Management; Journal Volume: 68; Other Information: Copyright (c) 2017 Elsevier Science B.V., Amsterdam, The Netherlands, All rights reserved.; Country of input: International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA)","","Medium: X; Size: page(s) 688-700","","","","Journal ID: ISSN 0956-053X; CODEN: WAMAE2; PII: S0956-053X(17)30455-5; TRN: US17R4422093103","10.1016/J.WASMAN.2017.06.014","","2019-03-08T00:00:00Z","22742159","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/22742159","","Waste Management","","68"

Results indicated that the mixture of K{sub 2}S{sub 2}O{sub 8} and NaCl (abbreviated as K{sub 2}S{sub 2}O{sub 8}/NaCl hereafter) was the most effective co-milling reagents in terms of high recovery rate.

Ag was concentrated in the leaching residue as AgCl and then recovered in 1 mol/L NH{sub 3} solution. XRD and XPS analysis indicated that elemental metals in the raw materials were transformed into their corresponding oxidation state during ball milling process at low temperature, implying that solid–solid phase reactions is the reaction mechanism. Based on the results and thermodynamic parameters of the probable reactions, possible reaction pathways during ball milling were proposed. Suggestion on category of e-waste for ball milling process was put forward according to the experiment results. The designed metal recovery process of this study has the advantages of highly recovery rate and quick leaching speed.

A reversal of this trend is not foreseeable, leading to concerns regarding the security of their supply. However, the evaluation of raw material supply is currently hampered by inconsistent use of fundamental terminologies and incomplete assessment criteria. In this paper, we aim to establish a consistent framework for evaluating raw material supply from both anthropogenic and geological sources. A method for concept extraction was applied to evaluate systematically the use of fundamental terms in the evaluation of raw material supply. The results have shown that ‘availability’ is commonly used in raw material supply evaluations, whilst other researchers suggest that raw material supply should be evaluated based on ‘accessibility’. It was revealed that ‘accessibility’ actually comprises two aspects: ‘availability’ and ‘approachability’. Raw material ‘approachability’ has not previously been explicitly addressed at a system level. A novel, consistent framework for evaluating raw material supply was therefore developed. To demonstrate the application of the established framework, we evaluated the raw material supply of four rare earth element case studies. Three case studies are End-of-Life products (the anthroposphere) from Switzerland: (i) phosphors in fluorescent lamps, (i) permanent magnets in the drive motors of electric cars and (iii) fibre optic cable. The fourth case study source is the Earth’s crust (the geosphere): Mount Weld deposit in Australia. The framework comprises a comprehensive evaluation of six components relating to raw material mining and processing: their geological knowledge, eligibility, technology, economic, societal and environmental impacts. Our results show that metals are not considered to be fully accessible in any of the case studies due to a lack of necessary technologies and potential societal and environmental impacts. The framework presented here can serve as a starting point for the development of an evaluation framework for raw material accessibility at an early project development stage.","","Available from http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.wasman.2017.05.043","","","","United States","2017-10-15T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: Waste Management; Journal Volume: 68; Other Information: Copyright (c) 2017 Elsevier Science B.V., Amsterdam, The Netherlands, All rights reserved.; Country of input: International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA)","","Medium: X; Size: page(s) 534-546","","","","Journal ID: ISSN 0956-053X; CODEN: WAMAE2; PII: S0956-053X(17)30396-3; TRN: US17R4413093094","10.1016/J.WASMAN.2017.05.043","","2019-03-08T00:00:00Z","22742150","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/22742150","","Waste Management","","68"

However, there are already potentially rich reserves of secondary materials via high ownership of Electrical and Electronic Equipment (EEE) in economically-developed nations. Young people are particularly high consumers of EEE, thus university students and campuses may present an opportunity to harness this potential. University Distinct Urban Mines (DUM) may be used to exemplify how potential reserves of secondary metals may be exploited, and could contribute to the transition from a linear to a circular economy. This study aimed to evaluate small household appliances (SHA) DUM from a UK university, with the objectives to identify and quantify student households’ SHA ownership, WEEE recycling, stockpiling and discarding habits amongst student households, assess and evaluate the monetary potential of SHA DUM at UK level, and propose methods to exploit DUM for universities in the UK. To this purpose, a quantitative survey was undertaken to measure students’ ownership and discarding behaviour with respect to SHA. The amounts of ferrous and non-ferrous materials were then estimated and converted to monetary values from secondary materials market data to appraise the SHA DUM overall value. Thirty-five per cent of SHA are discarded in the general refuse. Broken personal care appliances (PCA) tend to be discarded due to hygiene and small size factors. When in working order, SHA tend to be equally reused, recycled or stockpiled. We conclude that a total of 189 tonnes of ferrous and non-ferrous materials were available via discarding or being stockpiled at the University of Southampton.

Results suggest that a two-stage process where the first reactor is properly operated in order to achieve a significant net hydrogen production, may display a 20% comparatively higher energy recovery yield as a result, mainly, of enhanced methane production as well as of the associated hydrogen production. The highest methane production of the two-stage process was due to improved hydrolysis and fermentation of food waste, with increased amounts of volatile fatty acids being readily available to methanogenesis.","","Available from http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.wasman.2017.06.013","","","","United States","2017-10-15T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: Waste Management; Journal Volume: 68; Other Information: Copyright (c) 2017 Elsevier Science B.V., Amsterdam, The Netherlands, All rights reserved.; Country of input: International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA)","","Medium: X; Size: page(s) 595-602","","","","Journal ID: ISSN 0956-053X; CODEN: WAMAE2; PII: S0956-053X(17)30454-3; TRN: US17R4417093098","10.1016/J.WASMAN.2017.06.013","","2019-03-08T00:00:00Z","22742154","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/22742154","","Waste Management","","68"
"Comparative lifecycle assessment of alternatives for waste management in Rio de Janeiro – Investigating the influence of an attributional or consequential approach","Bernstad Saraiva, A., E-mail: anna.bernstad.saraiva@sage.coppe.ufrj.br; Souza, R.

The alternatives (sanitary landfill, selective collection of organic waste for anaerobic digestion and anaerobic digestion after post-separation of organic waste) were modelled applying an attributional as well as consequential approach, in parallel with the aim of identifying if and how these approaches can affect results and conclusions. The marginal processes identified in the consequential modelling were in general associated with higher environmental impacts than average processes modelled with an attributional approach. As all investigated waste management alternatives result in net-substitution of energy and in some cases also materials, the consequential modelling resulted in lower absolute environmental impacts in five of the seven environmental impact categories assessed in the study. In three of these, the chosen modelling approach can alter the hierarchy between compared waste management alternatives. This indicates a risk of underestimating potential benefits from efficient energy recovery from waste when applying attributional modelling in contexts in which electricity provision historically has been dominated by technologies presenting rather low environmental impacts, but where projections point at increasing impacts from electricity provision in coming years. Thus, in the present case study, the chosen approach affects both absolute and relative results from the comparison. However, results were largely related to the processes identified as affected by investigated changes, and not merely the chosen modelling approach. The processes actually affected by future choices between different waste management alternatives are intrinsically uncertain. The study demonstrates the benefits of applying different assumptions regarding the processes affected by investigated choices – both for provision of energy and materials substituted by waste management processes in consequential LCA modelling, in order to present outcomes that are relevant as decision support within the waste management sector.","","Available from http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.wasman.2017.07.002","","","","United States","2017-10-15T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: Waste Management; Journal Volume: 68; Other Information: Copyright (c) 2017 Elsevier Science B.V., Amsterdam, The Netherlands, All rights reserved.; Country of input: International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA)","","Medium: X; Size: page(s) 701-710","","","","Journal ID: ISSN 0956-053X; CODEN: WAMAE2; PII: S0956-053X(17)30494-4; TRN: US17R4423093104","10.1016/J.WASMAN.2017.07.002","","2019-03-08T00:00:00Z","22742160","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/22742160","","Waste Management","","68"

Coal remains the predominant fuel source and limited success has to date been achieved in the renewable energy sector. The electricity generation sector is therefore hindered from moving towards an electricity generation landscape where alternative fuel sources is utilised. This research is aimed at gaining insight into the enablers that led towards an increasing trend (observed globally) in exploiting waste as a fuel for electricity generation, and to outline the presence of obstacles that hinder separation of waste for electricity use in the South African context. Furthermore it is an attempt at informing what appropriate interventions (operational and policy) may be considered suitable for South Africa to overcome these barriers in order to enable a sustainable South African waste to electricity (WTE) Industry. Findings show that numerous barriers to a WTE exists in the South African context, however overcoming these barriers is not as simple as adopting the European model with the aim to modify the electricity generation mix and waste management landscape. Selected enablers deemed appropriate in the South African context are adapted from the European model, and are greatly influenced by the prevailing socio-economic status of South Africa. Primary enablers identified were, (i) government support is needed especially in the form of subsidisation for green energy, (ii) increase landfill costs through the implementation of a landfill tax, (iii) streamline the process for Independent Private Power Producers (IPPPs) to connect to the national grid with off-take guaranteed and the inclusion of WTE into an electricity roadmap (effectively government’s strategy). The proposed enabling interventions would help in overcoming the barriers for a South African WTE industry.","","Available from http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.wasman.2017.06.051","","","","United States","2017-10-15T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: Waste Management; Journal Volume: 68; Other Information: Copyright (c) 2017 Elsevier Science B.V., Amsterdam, The Netherlands, All rights reserved.; Country of input: International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA)","","Medium: X; Size: page(s) 774-785","","","","Journal ID: ISSN 0956-053X; CODEN: WAMAE2; PII: S0956-053X(17)30492-0; TRN: US17R4426093105","10.1016/J.WASMAN.2017.06.051","","2019-03-08T00:00:00Z","22742161","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/22742161","","Waste Management","","68"

The gel compositions were estimated based on the difference between the elemental glass starting compositions and the measured elemental leachate concentrations from the long-term product consistency tests (ASTM C1285) at various stages of dissolution, ie, reaction progress. A well-characterized subset of high level waste glasses from the database was selected: these glasses had been leached for 15-20 years at reaction progresses up to ~80%. The gel composition data, at various reaction progresses, were subjected to a step-wise regression, which demonstrated that hydrogel compositions with Si*/Al* ratios of <1.0 did not generate zeolites and maintained low dissolution rates for the duration of the experiments. Glasses that formed hydrogel compositions with Si^*/Al^* ratios ≥1, generated zeolites accompanied by a resumption in the glass dissolution rate. Finally, the role of the gel Si/Al ratio, and the interactions with the leachate, provides the fundamental understanding needed to predict if and when the glass dissolution rate will increase due to zeolitization.","American Ceramic Society","available","Savannah River Site (SRS), Aiken, SC (United States)","USDOE","","United States","2017-02-18T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: International Journal of Applied Glass Science; Journal Volume: 8; Journal Issue: 1","","Medium: ED; Size: p. 69-83","","SRNL-STI-2014-00274","AC09-08SR22470","Journal ID: ISSN 2041-1286","10.1111/ijag.12262","","2021-07-23T00:00:00Z","1372631","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/1372631","https://www.osti.gov/servlets/purl/1372631","International Journal of Applied Glass Science","1","8"

After treatment, the floatability of ABS has a dramatic decrease, while the floatability of PVC is not affected. Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FT-IR) spectra and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) spectra were recorded to ascertain the mechanism of Fenton treatment. FT-IR and XPS analysis confirms that the introduction of oxygen-containing group occurs on the surface of ABS.

Particle sizes and mixing ratios were also investigated. Plastic mixtures of ABS and PVC with different particle sizes and mixing ratios can be effectively separated. The purity of ABS and PVC are up to 100% and 99.78%, respectively; the recovery of ABS and PVC are up to 99.89% and 100%, respectively.

In the process, the medium density is one of key parameters and the value of the medium’s density is not just the average of the density of two kinds of plastics separated. Based on the force analysis and establishing the equation of motion of particles in the hydrocyclone, a formula to calculate the optimum separation medium density has been deduced. This value of the medium’s density is a function of various parameters including the diameter, density, radial position and tangential velocity of particles, and viscosity of the medium.

A batch reactor was used in this work to produce HAp powder from eggshells and synthetic urine (SU). Fine powder of calcined eggshells was dissolved in water to produce aqueous calcium hydroxide. The solution was then mixed with concentrated SU in stoichiometric amounts corresponding to HAp (Ca/P molar ratio ∼ 1.67). The initial pH of the solution was alkaline (pH ∼ 8.5) and particles formed rapidly with slight mixing. Stirring the turbid solution for a longer period (72 h) did not show any visual change, but the particle size decreased slightly. When the pH of the solution was adjusted to 5, the solution was initially clear, but particle formation was apparent after 48 h stirring. It was noticed that at a slow stirring speed (100 rpm), film formation occurred on the solution, whereas at a higher stirring speed (500 rpm) no such film formation was observed. X-ray diffraction (XRD) analysis confirmed that the particles (formed at 500 rpm) were an amorphous calcium phosphate (CaP). Alkaline treatment at 80 °C for 2 h converted the amorphous CaP into HAp. Inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry (ICP-MS) analysis of the particles (formed at 500 rpm) suggested that they are calcium-deficient HAp (Ca/P molar ratio 1.58).","","Available from http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.wasman.2017.05.045","","","","United States","2017-09-15T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: Waste Management; Journal Volume: 67; Other Information: Copyright (c) 2017 Elsevier Science B.V., Amsterdam, The Netherlands, All rights reserved.; Country of input: International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA)","","Medium: X; Size: page(s) 67-72","","","","Journal ID: ISSN 0956-053X; CODEN: WAMAE2; PII: S0956-053X(17)30428-2; TRN: US17R4369093060","10.1016/J.WASMAN.2017.05.045","","2019-03-08T00:00:00Z","22742116","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/22742116","","Waste Management","","67"
"Municipal solid waste processing and separation employing wet torrefaction for alternative fuel production and aluminum reclamation","Mu'min, Gea Fardias, E-mail: mumin.g.aa@m.titech.ac.jp; Department of Mechanical Engineering, Institut Teknologi Bandung, Bandung (Indonesia)]; Prawisudha, Pandji; Zaini, Ilman Nuran; Aziz, Muhammad; Pasek, Ari Darmawan","12 MANAGEMENT OF RADIOACTIVE WASTES, AND NON-RADIOACTIVE WASTES FROM NUCLEAR FACILITIES; ALTERNATIVE FUELS; ALUMINIUM; CALORIFIC VALUE; MUNICIPAL WASTES; PLASTICS; SOLID WASTES; TEMPERATURE RANGE 0065-0273 K; THERMAL GRAVIMETRIC ANALYSIS; WASTE PROCESSING","Highlights: • The MSW treatment and separation based on wet torrefaction process are proposed. • The organic and plastic fraction of MSW can be separated at a low temperature. • The process can detach the aluminum and plastics layer of laminated aluminum waste. • The addition of acid in the wet torrefaction process enhances aluminum yields. • The calorific values of the both organic and plastics products are increased. - Abstract: This study employs wet torrefaction process (also known as hydrothermal) at low temperature. This process simultaneously acts as waste processing and separation of mixed waste, for subsequent utilization as an alternative fuel. The process is also applied for the delamination and separation of non-recyclable laminated aluminum waste into separable aluminum and plastic. A 2.5-L reactor was used to examine the wet torrefaction process at temperatures below 200 °C. It was observed that the processed mixed waste was converted into two different products: a mushy organic part and a bulky plastic part. Using mechanical separation, the two products can be separated into a granular organic product and a plastic bulk for further treatment. TGA analysis showed that no changes in the plastic composition and no intrusion from plastic fraction to the organic fraction. It can be proclaimed that both fractions have been completely separated by wet torrefaction. The separated plastic fraction product obtained from the wet torrefaction treatment also contained relatively high calorific value (approximately 44 MJ/kg), therefore, justifying its use as an alternative fuel. The non-recyclable plastic fraction of laminated aluminum was observed to be delaminated and separated from its aluminum counterpart at a temperature of 170 °C using an additional acetic acid concentration of 3%, leaving less than 25% of the plastic content in the aluminum part. Plastic products from both samples had high calorific values of more than 30 MJ/kg, which is sufficient to be converted and used as a fuel.","","Available from http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.wasman.2017.05.022","","","","United States","2017-09-15T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: Waste Management; Journal Volume: 67; Other Information: Copyright (c) 2017 Elsevier Science B.V., Amsterdam, The Netherlands, All rights reserved.; Country of input: International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA)","","Medium: X; Size: page(s) 106-120","","","","Journal ID: ISSN 0956-053X; CODEN: WAMAE2; PII: S0956-053X(17)30345-8; TRN: US17R4370093061","10.1016/J.WASMAN.2017.05.022","","2019-03-08T00:00:00Z","22742117","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/22742117","","Waste Management","","67"

Experiments using five zeolitic and clay-based catalysts of different forms (pellet and powders) and different plastic feedstocks – virgin HDPE, HDPE w1aste and mixed plastic waste (MPW) were compared to the control experiments – pyrolysis without catalyst. Results indicated that the two pelletized catalysts were the most promising for the conditions employed. Of these two, one with higher acidity and surface area was highly selective for the gasoline fraction (C{sub 5}–C{sub 11}) giving 80% from the total medium distillate conversion using virgin HDPE as feedstock. It also produced the least amount of olefins (17% for virgin HDPE, 4% for HDPE waste and 2% for MPW) and coke (<1% for virgin HDPE, 3% for HDPE waste and 5% for MPW), and the highest aromatics content (22% for virgin HDPE from un-distilled medium distillate, 5% for HDPE and 13% for MPW both from distilled medium distillate). The second pelletized catalyst exhibited high selectivity for the diesel fraction (C{sub 12}–C{sub 25}) giving 63% from the total medium distillate conversion using virgin HDPE as feedstock. The amount of coke deposited on the catalyst surface depended mainly on the mesopore volume, with less coke deposited as the mesopore volume increased. The variation in catalyst selectivity with acidity strength due to Lewis sites on the catalyst surface controls selectivity towards carbon chain length.","","Available from http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.wasman.2017.05.011","","","","United States","2017-09-15T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: Waste Management; Journal Volume: 67; Other Information: Copyright (c) 2017 Elsevier Science B.V., Amsterdam, The Netherlands, All rights reserved.; Country of input: International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA)","","Medium: X; Size: page(s) 143-154","","","","Journal ID: ISSN 0956-053X; CODEN: WAMAE2; PII: S0956-053X(17)30313-6; TRN: US17R4372093062","10.1016/J.WASMAN.2017.05.011","","2019-03-08T00:00:00Z","22742118","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/22742118","","Waste Management","","67"

S.An.A.®(Semi-aerobic, Anaerobic, Aerated) concept consists in a Hybrid Bioreactor featuring a first semi-aerobic phase to enhance the methane production occurring in the following anaerobic step and a forced aeration for the abatement of the residual emissions. At the end of the last step, semi-aerobic conditions are restored and flushing applied for leaching residual non-biodegradable compounds. Results of the application of S.An.A.® concept to a lab scale bioreactor system showed that pre-aeration was effective in controlling the concentration of VFA, increasing pH and stimulating methane production during anaerobic phase; in particular with intermittent airflow the methane potential was 50% higher respect to control reactors. Forced aeration reduced organic compounds and nitrogen concentration in leachate of an order of magnitude, better performing in low airflow reactors. S.An.A.® Hybrid bioreactors proved to be an efficient system both for increasing methane production and reaching landfill completion in shorter time, suggesting that with proper landfill management, the duration of post-closure care might be reduced by 25–35%.","","Available from http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.wasman.2017.05.006","","","","United States","2017-09-15T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: Waste Management; Journal Volume: 67; Other Information: Copyright (c) 2017 Elsevier Science B.V., Amsterdam, The Netherlands, All rights reserved.; Country of input: International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA)","","Medium: X; Size: page(s) 193-202","","","","Journal ID: ISSN 0956-053X; CODEN: WAMAE2; PII: S0956-053X(17)30308-2; TRN: US17R4374093063","10.1016/J.WASMAN.2017.05.006","","2019-03-08T00:00:00Z","22742119","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/22742119","","Waste Management","","67"

The impact of several explicative variables on the results of e-waste collection is evaluated. The independent variables are socio-economic and demographic ones (age, gender, household size, education level, migration and income) along with technical-organisational variables (population density, presence of metropoles, macro regions, characteristics of the territory, percentage of household waste collected separately and number of e-waste collection points). The results show that the presence of collection points, the percentage of household waste collected separately and the percentage of females are positively correlated with the kg collected per inhabitant per year. For example, a variation of 1% of input (presence of collection points) corresponds to a 0.25% variation in the output (collection results) while 1% difference in the percentage of females in the population corresponds to a 7.549% difference in the collection rate. Population density, instead, is negatively correlated. It is interesting to note that there is a discrepancy between the Southern regions and the Centre regions (the former have an outcome 0.66 times lower than the latter) while the Northern regions perform similarly to the Centre ones. Moreover, the first year (2008) had a very low performance compared to the following years when the scheme constantly improved, mainly due to the additional collection points available. The Stochastic Frontier Model allows for the identification of the optimal production function among the 20 Italian regions. The best performing region is Tuscany (in the Centre), followed by Sardinia and Sicily (in the South).","","Available from http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.wasman.2017.05.026","","","","United States","2017-09-15T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: Waste Management; Journal Volume: 67; Other Information: Copyright (c) 2017 Elsevier Science B.V., Amsterdam, The Netherlands, All rights reserved.; Country of input: International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA)","","Medium: X; Size: page(s) 222-231","","","","Journal ID: ISSN 0956-053X; CODEN: WAMAE2; PII: S0956-053X(17)30349-5; TRN: US17R4376093064","10.1016/J.WASMAN.2017.05.026","","2019-03-08T00:00:00Z","22742120","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/22742120","","Waste Management","","67"

For this purpose Cyphos IL 102 diluted in toluene was employed for the extraction and recovery of Zn and Cd from Zn-C and Ni-Cd batteries leach liquor. The influence of extractant concentration for the leach liquors of Zn-C (0.01–0.05 mol/L) and Ni-Cd (0.04–0.20 mol/L) batteries has been investigated. Composition of the leach liquor obtained from Zn-C/Ni-Cd spent batteries is Zn - 2.18 g/L, Mn - 4.59 g/L, Fe - 4.0 × 10{sup −3} g/L, Ni - 0.2 × 10{sup −3} g/L/Cd - 4.28 g/L, Ni - 0.896 × 10{sup −1} g/L, Fe - 0.148 g/L, Co - 3.77 × 10{sup −3} g/L, respectively. Two stage counter current extraction at A/O 1:1 and 3:2 with 0.04 mol/L and 0.2 mol/L Cyphos IL 102 for Zn and Cd, respectively provide more than 99.0% extraction of both the metal ions with almost negligible extraction of associated metal ions. A stripping efficiency of around 99.0% for Zn and Cd was obtained at O/A 1:1 using 1.0 mol/L HNO{sub 3} in two and three counter current stages, respectively. ZnO and CdO were also synthesized using the loaded organic phase and characterized using XRD, FE-SEM and EDX techniques. XRD peaks of ZnO and CdO correspond to zincite and monteponite, respectively. The average particle size was ∼27.0 nm and ∼37.0 nm for ZnO and CdO, respectively. The EDX analysis of ZnO and CdO shows almost 1:1 atomic percentage.","","Available from http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.wasman.2017.05.027","","","","United States","2017-09-15T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: Waste Management; Journal Volume: 67; Other Information: Copyright (c) 2017 Elsevier Science B.V., Amsterdam, The Netherlands, All rights reserved.; Country of input: International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA)","","Medium: X; Size: page(s) 240-252","","","","Journal ID: ISSN 0956-053X; CODEN: WAMAE2; PII: S0956-053X(17)30351-3; TRN: US17R4378093065","10.1016/J.WASMAN.2017.05.027","","2019-03-08T00:00:00Z","22742121","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/22742121","","Waste Management","","67"

In this paper, a novel and effective process for the detoxification and reutilization of waste CRT funnel glass was developed by generating lead sulfide precipitate via a high-temperature melting process. The central function in this process was the generation of lead sulfide, which gathered at the bottom of the crucible and was then separated from the slag. Sodium carbonate was used as a flux and reaction agent, and sodium sulfide was used as a precipitating agent. The experimental results revealed that the lead sulfide recovery rate initially increased with an increase in the amount of added sodium carbonate, the amount of sodium sulfide, the temperature, and the holding time and then reached an equilibrium value. The maximum lead sulfide recovery rate was approximately 93%, at the optimum sodium carbonate level, sodium sulfide level, temperature, and holding time of 25%, 8%, 1200 °C, and 2 h, respectively. The glass slag can be made into sodium and potassium silicate by hydrolysis in an environmental and economical process.","","Available from http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.wasman.2017.05.048","","","","United States","2017-09-15T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: Waste Management; Journal Volume: 67; Other Information: Copyright (c) 2017 Elsevier Science B.V., Amsterdam, The Netherlands, All rights reserved.; Country of input: International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA)","","Medium: X; Size: page(s) 253-258","","","","Journal ID: ISSN 0956-053X; CODEN: WAMAE2; PII: S0956-053X(17)30431-2; TRN: US17R4379093066","10.1016/J.WASMAN.2017.05.048","","2019-03-08T00:00:00Z","22742122","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/22742122","","Waste Management","","67"

Studies have been undertaken to reduce their environmental impact. In this study, an alternative gas was produced from automobile tyre wastes by the means of a controlled pyrolysis. To do so, a novel catalytic system was designed with the aim of increasing the rate of conversion and improving the quality of the pyrolysis products. This work aimed also to reduce the severity of the overall reactions, by using powder catalysts (MgO, Al{sub 2}O{sub 3}, CaCO{sub 3}, and zeolite ZSM-5) uniformly distributed on two layers of oyster shells (OS) particles. The catalyst/tyres mass ratio was kept for all the tests at 1/30. The pyrolysis reactor was maintained at 500 °C and the influence of each catalyst and of the number of shell beds (0, 1 or 2), on the yield and composition of the derived products, was examined. The gas yields could contribute by 1.2% of total consumption in Tunisia. Furthermore, some combinations could upgrade the derived gas and made it possible to use it as such or with the minimum of post-treatment. It was found that, with the use of supported catalyst, the gas produced is 45% greater compared to classical thermal pyrolysis. The Heating value of the produced gas was also improved by the use of supported catalysts; it was found 16% greater with the use of Al{sub 2}O{sub 3}/OS compared to non-catalytic pyrolysis. When compared to the gas obtained from only one catalytic supported bed, the sulfur content was reduced by 80% with the use of CaCO{sub 3}/OS on two catalytic beds.","","Available from http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.wasman.2017.06.001","","","","United States","2017-09-15T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: Waste Management; Journal Volume: 67; Other Information: Copyright (c) 2017 Elsevier Science B.V., Amsterdam, The Netherlands, All rights reserved.; Country of input: International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA)","","Medium: X; Size: page(s) 288-297","","","","Journal ID: ISSN 0956-053X; CODEN: WAMAE2; PII: S0956-053X(17)30439-7; TRN: US17R4380093067","10.1016/J.WASMAN.2017.06.001","","2019-03-08T00:00:00Z","22742123","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/22742123","","Waste Management","","67"

There is an emerging consensus that a sustainable approach to waste management requires further development of secondary raw material markets. The purpose of this paper is to propose a theoretical economic model that focuses upon this stage of a sustainable waste management program and explores policy options that could motivate efficiency in secondary raw material markets. In particular, we show how firm profit and social welfare optimizing objectives can be reconciled in a two-product market of waste management processes: landfilling and material reclamation. Our results provide theoretical support for building out recent Circular Economy initiatives as well as for the relatively recent emergence of landfill mining as a means for procuring secondary raw materials.","","Available from http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.wasman.2017.05.036","","","","United States","2017-09-15T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: Waste Management; Journal Volume: 67; Other Information: Copyright (c) 2017 Elsevier Science B.V., Amsterdam, The Netherlands, All rights reserved.; Country of input: International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA)","","Medium: X; Size: page(s) 354-359","","","","Journal ID: ISSN 0956-053X; CODEN: WAMAE2; PII: S0956-053X(17)30363-X; TRN: US17R4382093069","10.1016/J.WASMAN.2017.05.036","","2019-03-08T00:00:00Z","22742125","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/22742125","","Waste Management","","67"

Incineration, the most widely used method, is difficult to implement in low populated areas because it requires a large amount of waste to be viable (100,000 tons per year). This paper analyses the economic and environmental costs of different MSW-to-Energy technologies (WtE) in an area comprising of 13 municipalities in southern Spain. We analyse anaerobic digestion (Biomethanization), the production of solid recovered fuel (SRF) and gasification, and compare these approaches to the present Biological Mechanical Treatment (BMT) with elimination of the reject in landfill, and incineration with energy recovery. From an economic standpoint the implementation of WtE systems reduces the cost of running present BMT systems and incineration; gasification presents the lowest value. From the environmental standpoint, Life Cycle Assessment shows that any WtE alternatives, including incineration, present important advantages for the environment when compared to BMT. Finally, in order to select the best alternative, a multi-criteria method is applied, showing that anaerobic digestion is the optimal solution for the area studied.","","Available from http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.wasman.2017.05.003","","","","United States","2017-09-15T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: Waste Management; Journal Volume: 67; Other Information: Copyright (c) 2017 Elsevier Science B.V., Amsterdam, The Netherlands, All rights reserved.; Country of input: International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA)","","Medium: X; Size: page(s) 360-374","","","","Journal ID: ISSN 0956-053X; CODEN: WAMAE2; PII: S0956-053X(17)30305-7; TRN: US17R4383093070","10.1016/J.WASMAN.2017.05.003","","2019-03-08T00:00:00Z","22742126","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/22742126","","Waste Management","","67"

X-ray diffraction, 2-D X-ray absorption near edge structure (XANES), electron microscopy, inductively coupled plasma-atomic emission spectroscopy (and inductively coupled plasma-mass spectroscopy for Cs), and product consistency tests were used to characterize the fabricated CCIM material.

Because reduced Tc, Tc(IV), substitutes for Fe(III) in the crystal structure by a process of Tc reduction from Tc(VII) to Tc(IV) followed by co-precipitation of Fe oxide minerals, two Tc-incorporated Fe minerals (Tc-goethite and Tc-magnetite/maghemite) were prepared and tested for Tc retention in glass melt samples at temperatures between 600 and 1000 °C. After being cooled, the solid glass specimens prepared at different temperatures at 600, 800, and 1000 °C were analyzed for Tc oxidation state using Tc K-edge XANES. In most samples, Tc was partially (<60%) oxidized from Tc(IV) to Tc(VII) as the melt temperature increased up to 600 °C. However, most of Tc(IV) was completely (>95%) oxidized to Tc(VII) at temperature above 800 °C. In conclusion, Tc retention in glass melt samples prepared using Tc-incorporated Fe minerals were slightly higher (~10%) than in glass prepared using KTcO4 because of limited and delayed Tc volatilization.","Elsevier","","Pacific Northwest National Lab.

Currently, the main application of the UDB is to support evaluation of the characteristics of discharged spent nuclear fuel (SNF) from the U.S. commercial reactors. However, because of the extensive amount of data that has been collected and analyzed for UNF-ST&DARDS, there are many more applications that can utilize the UDB including system analysis with the Next-Generation System Analysis Model (NGSAM) and fuel cycle analysis with fuel cycle simulation codes such as ORION. Going forward, NGSAM and fuel cycle transition analysis with ORION integrate UDB data wherever possible in the UDB’s development plan. Finally, these advances in NGSAM and fuel cycle analysis can be used in conjunction with the UDB to help answer more complex questions about the optimization, utilization, storage, and eventual disposal of SNF.","Taylor & Francis - formerly American Nuclear Society (ANS)","","Oak Ridge National Lab.

This database, referred to as the Unified Database (UDB), is part of a larger engineering analysis tool, the Used Nuclear Fuel Storage, Transportation & Disposal Analysis Resource and Data System (UNF-ST&DARDS). The UDB provides a comprehensive, controlled source of SNF information, including dry cask attributes, assembly data, economic attributes, transportation infrastructure attributes, potential future facility attributes, and federal government radioactive waste attributes. There are a number of existing and envisioned data reports that can be expected to use data stored within the UDB; however, previously, there was not a streamlined method to couple the database to such data reports. Therefore, to streamline the creation of these reports, two methods were developed to generate documents from information in the database automatically. The first method used Java and LaTeX for automatically generating the report, and the second method used the Python programming language along with Sphinx, a Python documentation generator. There are some advantages and disadvantages to both approaches, but both methods produced equally high-quality, automatically generated reports that were directly coupled to the database. Finally, this study describes data currently available in the UDB; explains the two different methods for automatically generating reports from these data; and shows examples of inline text, figures, and tables automatically generated using both approaches.","Taylor & Francis - formerly American Nuclear Society (ANS)","","Oak Ridge National Lab.

With the rising demand comes additional pressure to ensure the integrity of dry cask systems. Visual inspection is costly and man-power intensive, so alternative nondestructive testing techniques are desired to insure the continued safe and effective storage of fuel. One such approach being investigated by the University of Florida is neutron based computed tomography. Simulations in MCNP are preformed where D-T energy neutrons are transmitted through the dry cask and measured on the opposite side. If the transmitted signal is clear enough, the interior of the cask can be reconstructed from the measurement of the alterations of neutron signal intensity using standard mathematical techniques developed for medical imaging. Preliminary efforts show a correlation between energy and number of scatters (which is an indication of retention of position information). Work is ongoing to quantify if the correlation is strong enough that an energy discriminator may be used as a filter in future image reconstruction. The calculated transmission probability suggests that an image could be reconstructed with a week of scanning.","Elsevier","","Univ. of Michigan, Ann Arbor, MI (United States)","USDOE NA Office of Nonproliferation and Verification Research and Development (NA-22); USDOE National Nuclear Security Administration (NNSA), Office of Defense Nuclear Nonproliferation","","United States","2017-08-23T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: Nuclear Instruments and Methods in Physics Research.

Biochar due to its recalcitrance and sorption properties can be used in composting as a bulking agent and/or amendment. The addition of a bulking agent to high moisture raw materials can assure optimal moisture content and enough air-filled porosity but not necessarily the C/N ratio. Therefore, amendment of low C/N composting mixtures with biochar at low rates can have a positive effect on composting dynamics. This work aimed at evaluating the effect of selected doses of wood derived biochar amendment (0%, 5% and 10%, wet weight) to poultry manure (P) mixed with wheat straw (S) (in the ratio of 1:0.4 on wet weight) on the total ammonia emissions (including gaseous emissions of ammonia and liquid emissions of ammonium in the collected condensate and leachate) during composting. The process was performed in 165 L laboratory scale composting reactors for 42 days. The addition of 5% and 10% of biochar reduced gaseous ammonia emission by 30% and 44%, respectively. According to the obtained results, the measure of emission through the condensate would be necessary to assess the impact of the total ammonia emission during the composting process.","","Available from http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.wasman.2017.04.033","","","","United States","2017-08-15T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: Waste Management; Journal Volume: 66; Other Information: Copyright (c) 2017 Elsevier Science B.V., Amsterdam, The Netherlands, All rights reserved.; Country of input: International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA)","","Medium: X; Size: page(s) 36-45","","","","Journal ID: ISSN 0956-053X; CODEN: WAMAE2; PII: S0956-053X(17)30289-1; TRN: US17R4356093051","10.1016/J.WASMAN.2017.04.033","","2019-03-08T00:00:00Z","22742107","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/22742107","","Waste Management","","66"

This practice is considered to have favorable impact on the environment, but its benefits have yet to be established. Existing research describes the perspective of “avoided production” only, but has failed to examine the interdependent nature of reuse practices within an entire solid waste management system. This study proposes a new framework that uses optimization to minimize the greenhouse gas emissions of an integrated solid waste management system that includes reuse strategies and practices such as reuse enterprises, online platforms, and materials exchanges along with traditional solid waste management practices such as recycling, landfilling, and incineration. The proposed framework uses material flow analysis in combination with an optimization model to provide the best outcome in terms of GHG emissions by redistributing product flows in the integrated solid waste management system to the least impacting routes and processes. The optimization results provide a basis for understanding the contributions of reuse to the environmental benefits of the integrated solid waste management system and the exploration of the effects of reuse activities on waste prevention. A case study involving second-hand clothing is presented to illustrate the implementation of the proposed framework as applied to the material flow. Results of the case study showed the considerable impact of reuse on GHG emissions even for small replacement rates, and helped illustrate the interdependency of the reuse sector with other waste management practices. One major contribution of this study is the development of a framework centered on product reuse that can be applied to identify the best management strategies to reduce the environmental impact of product disposal and to increase recovery of reusable products.","","Available from http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.wasman.2017.04.032","","","","United States","2017-08-15T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: Waste Management; Journal Volume: 66; Other Information: Copyright (c) 2017 Elsevier Science B.V., Amsterdam, The Netherlands, All rights reserved.; Country of input: International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA)","","Medium: X; Size: page(s) 178-189","","","","Journal ID: ISSN 0956-053X; CODEN: WAMAE2; PII: S0956-053X(17)30287-8; TRN: US17R4362093054","10.1016/J.WASMAN.2017.04.032","","2019-03-08T00:00:00Z","22742110","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/22742110","","Waste Management","","66"

In Portugal, thousands of tons of waste are generated from used cooking oil and production of nut shells’ residues is growing every year. In addition, the high consumption of citrus fruits, oranges in particular, generates large amounts of citrus peel. Therefore, it is necessary to diversify reuse mechanisms of these wastes, in order to make them back into raw materials. Complying with this trend, this work was carried out by processing and grinding almond shells, treating used oil, processing orange peels and extracting limonene, formulating and producing soap, and performing an acceptance study of the final product. Results validated a high potential of the idea in the field of environmental education, so it can be replicated in practical classes.

In this work, solid residuals from thermal gasification and co-gasification of municipal sewage sludge were investigated for their potential use as fertilizer. Ashes from five different low temperature circulating fluidized bed (LT-CFB) gasification campaigns including two mono-sludge campaigns, two sludge/straw mixed fuels campaigns and a straw reference campaign were compared. Experiments were conducted on two different LT-CFBs with thermal capacities of 100 kW and 6 MW, respectively. The assessment included: (i) Elemental composition and recovery of key elements and heavy metals; (ii) content of total carbon (C) and total nitrogen (N); (iii) pH; (iv) water extractability of phosphorus after incubation in soil; and (v) plant phosphorus response measured in a pot experiment with the most promising ash material. Co-gasification of straw and sludge in LT-CFB gasifiers produced ashes with a high content of recalcitrant C, phosphorus (P) and potassium (K), a low content of heavy metals (especially cadmium) and an improved plant P availability compared to the mono-sludge ashes, thereby showing the best fertilizer qualities among all assessed materials. It was also found that bottom ashes from the char reactor contained even less heavy metals than cyclone ashes. It is concluded that LT-CFB gasification and co-gasification is a highly effective way to purify and sanitize sewage sludge for subsequent use in agricultural systems.","","Available from http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.wasman.2017.04.043","","","","United States","2017-08-15T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: Waste Management; Journal Volume: 66; Other Information: Copyright (c) 2017 Elsevier Science B.V., Amsterdam, The Netherlands, All rights reserved.; Country of input: International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA)","","Medium: X; Size: page(s) 145-154","","","","Journal ID: ISSN 0956-053X; CODEN: WAMAE2; PII: S0956-053X(17)30301-X; TRN: US17R4360093053","10.1016/J.WASMAN.2017.04.043","","2019-03-08T00:00:00Z","22742109","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/22742109","","Waste Management","","66"

Local authorities need to find more effective ways to involve stakeholders and communities in decision-making since public acceptance of municipal waste facilities is integral to delivering effective waste strategies. This paper presents findings from a research project that explored attitudes towards greater levels of public involvement in UK waste management decision-making. The study addressed questions of perception, interests, the decision context, the means of engagement and the necessary resources and capacity for adopting a participatory decision process. Adopting a mixed methods approach, the research produced an empirical framework for negotiating the mode and level of public involvement in waste management decision-making. The framework captures and builds on theories of public involvement and the experiences of practitioners, and offers guidance for integrating analysis and deliberation with public groups in different waste management decision contexts. Principles in the framework operate on the premise that the decision about ‘more’ and ‘better’ forms of public involvement can be negotiated, based on the nature of the waste problem and wider social context of decision-making. The collection of opinions from the wide range of stakeholders involved in the study has produced new insights for the design of public engagement processes that are context-dependent and ‘fit-for-purpose’; these suggest a need for greater inclusivity in the case of contentious technologies and high levels of uncertainty regarding decision outcomes.","","Available from http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.wasman.2017.04.022","","","","United States","2017-08-15T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: Waste Management; Journal Volume: 66; Other Information: Copyright (c) 2017 Elsevier Science B.V., Amsterdam, The Netherlands, All rights reserved.; Country of input: International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA)","","Medium: X; Size: page(s) 210-221","","","","Journal ID: ISSN 0956-053X; CODEN: WAMAE2; PII: S0956-053X(17)30251-9; TRN: US17R4365093056","10.1016/J.WASMAN.2017.04.022","","2019-03-08T00:00:00Z","22742112","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/22742112","","Waste Management","","66"

The plutonium tetrafluoride, as received, was an unusual color and considering the age of the plutonium, there were questions about the condition of the material. These questions had to be answered in order to determine the suitability of the material for future use or long-term storage. Therefore, thermogravimetric/differential thermal analysis and X-ray diffraction evaluations were conducted to determine the plutonium's crystal structure, oxide content, and moisture content; these analyses reported that the plutonium was predominately amorphous and tetrafluoride, with an oxide content near ten percent. Freshly fluorinated plutonium tetrafluoride is known to be monoclinic. And during the initial thermogravimetric/differential thermal analyses, it was discovered that an exothermic event occurred within the material near 414 °C. X-ray diffraction analyses were conducted on the annealed tetrafluoride. The X-ray diffraction analyses indicated that some degree of recrystallization occurred in conjunction with the 414 °C event.

This paper focuses on the addition of getter materials to Cast Stone that can sequester Tc from the LAW, and in turn, lower Tc release from the Cast Stone. Two getters which produce different products upon sequestering Tc from LAW were tested: Sn(II) apatite (Sn-A) that removes Tc as a Tc(IV)-oxide and potassium metal sulfide (KMS-2) that removes Tc as a Tc(IV)-sulfide species, allowing for a comparison of stability of the form of Tc upon entering the waste form. The Cast Stone with KMS-2 getter had the best performance with addition equivalent to ~0.08 wt% of the total waste form mass. The observed diffusion (D<sub>obs</sub>) of Tc decreased from 4.6 ± 0.2 × 10<sup>-12</sup> cm<sup>2</sup>/s for Cast Stone that did not contain a getter to 5.4 ± 0.4 × 10<sup>-13</sup> cm<sup>2</sup>/s for KMS-2 containing Cast Stone.

"Supply and demand of some critical metals and present status of their recycling in WEEE","Zhang, Shengen; Ding, Yunji; Liu, Bo; Chang, Chein-chi","12 MANAGEMENT OF RADIOACTIVE WASTES, AND NON-RADIOACTIVE WASTES FROM NUCLEAR FACILITIES; ELECTRONIC EQUIPMENT; INDIUM; RARE EARTHS; RECYCLING; SUPPLY AND DEMAND; WASTE MANAGEMENT","Highlights: • Consumption and future demand of critical metals were reviewed. • The global WEEE generation was summarized. •The global WEEE management and recycling were reviewed. • The inefficient collection of WEEE is the main obstacle to metal recycling. • WEEE recycling can potentially relieve the supply risk of critical metals. - Abstract: New development and technological innovations make electrical and electronic equipment (EEE) more functional by using an increasing number of metals, particularly the critical metals (e.g. rare and precious metals) with specialized properties. As millions of people in emerging economies adopt a modern lifestyle, the demand for critical metals is soaring. However, the increasing demand causes the crisis of their supply because of their simple deficiency in the Earth’s crust or geopolitical constraints which might create political issues for their supply. This paper focuses on the sustainable supply of typical critical metals (indium, rare earth elements (REEs), lithium, cobalt and precious metals) through recycling waste electrical and electronic equipment (WEEE). To illuminate this issue, the production, consumption, expected future demand, current recycling situation of critical metals, WEEE management and their recycling have been reviewed. We find that the demand of indium, REEs, lithium and cobalt in EEE will continuously increasing, while precious metals are decreasing because of new substitutions with less or even without precious metals. Although the generation of WEEE in 2014 was about 41.9 million tons (Mt), just about 15% (6.5 Mt) was treated environmentally. The inefficient collection of WEEE is the main obstacle to relieving the supply risk of critical metals. Furthermore, due to the widespread use in low concentrations, such as indium, their recycling is not just technological problem, but economic feasibility is. Finally, relevant recommendations are point out to address these issues.","","Available from http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.wasman.2017.04.003","","","","United States","2017-07-15T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: Waste Management; Journal Volume: 65; Other Information: Copyright (c) 2017 Elsevier Science B.V., Amsterdam, The Netherlands, All rights reserved.; Country of input: International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA)","","Medium: X; Size: page(s) 113-127","","","","Journal ID: ISSN 0956-053X; CODEN: WAMAE2; PII: S0956-053X(17)30236-2; TRN: US17R4351093046","10.1016/J.WASMAN.2017.04.003","","2019-03-08T00:00:00Z","22742102","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/22742102","","Waste Management","","65"

Since these residues contain substantial amount of heavy metals including Cd, Zn and Cu, therefore, they are considered as hazardous wastes. In order to realize decontamination treatment and efficient extraction of the valuable metals from the CZPR, a comprehensive recovery process using sulfuric acid as the leaching reagent and air as the oxidizing reagent has been proposed. The effect of temperature, sulfuric acid concentration, particle size, solid/liquid ratio and stirring speed on the cadmium extraction efficiency was investigated. The leaching kinetics of cadmium was also studied. It was concluded that the cadmium leaching process was controlled by the solid film diffusion process. Moreover, the order of the reaction rate constant versus H{sub 2}SO{sub 4} concentration, particle size, solid/liquid ratio and stirring speed was calculated. The XRD and SEM-EDS analysis results showed that the main phases of the secondary sulfuric acid leaching residues were lead sulfate and calcium sulfate.","","Available from http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.wasman.2017.03.039","","","","United States","2017-07-15T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: Waste Management; Journal Volume: 65; Other Information: Copyright (c) 2017 Elsevier Science B.V., Amsterdam, The Netherlands, All rights reserved.; Country of input: International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA)","","Medium: X; Size: page(s) 128-138","","","","Journal ID: ISSN 0956-053X; CODEN: WAMAE2; PII: S0956-053X(17)30186-1; TRN: US17R4352093047","10.1016/J.WASMAN.2017.03.039","","2019-03-08T00:00:00Z","22742103","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/22742103","","Waste Management","","65"

The study shows that cracking and separation of layers of PCBs increases as the temperature increases; and decreases as the surface area of PCBs increases. After separation of layers, the used solvent was analyzed by proton and carbon nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy (NMR) to understand the dissolution phenomenon of resin. Further, NMR and Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy analysis of DMA sample after 1 h, 2 h, 3 h, 4 h and 8 h of reaction with PCBs at 433 K and PCB:DMA ratio (wt/vol) of 3:10 has been carried out to investigate the mechanism of dissolution of resin. These studies revealed that hydroxyl group of PCBs polymeric chain participates in hydrogen bonding with parent carbonyl group of DMA molecule that results in the solvation of resin. Possible chemical reaction based on the above finding has been discussed. Using this technique, separation of the metallic fraction without application of any energy intensive mechanical pre-processing is possible.","","Available from http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.wasman.2017.04.013","","","","United States","2017-07-15T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: Waste Management; Journal Volume: 65; Other Information: Copyright (c) 2017 Elsevier Science B.V., Amsterdam, The Netherlands, All rights reserved.; Country of input: International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA)","","Medium: X; Size: page(s) 139-146","","","","Journal ID: ISSN 0956-053X; CODEN: WAMAE2; PII: S0956-053X(17)30240-4; TRN: US17R4353093048","10.1016/J.WASMAN.2017.04.013","","2019-03-08T00:00:00Z","22742104","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/22742104","","Waste Management","","65"
"Optimization and characterization of hydrochar produced from microwave hydrothermal carbonization of fish waste","Kannan, Shrikalaa; Gariepy, Yvan; Raghavan, G.S. Vijaya","12 MANAGEMENT OF RADIOACTIVE WASTES, AND NON-RADIOACTIVE WASTES FROM NUCLEAR FACILITIES; ASH CONTENT; CALORIFIC VALUE; CARBONIZATION; LIQUID WASTES; MUNICIPAL WASTES; WASTE PROCESSING","Highlights: • Microwave hydrothermal carbonization (MHTC) converts fish waste to hydrochar. • MHTC of fish waste at ∼200 °C for ∼119 min produces maximal hydrochar yield (∼34%). • Based on MHTC conditions, hydrochar has ∼25–57% atomic carbon, and ∼20–28% ash. • Microsphere-rich hydrochar has energy value that ranges from 19 to 24.5 MJ/kg. • MHTC can convert pure non-lignocellulosic fish waste to good quality hydrochar. - Abstract: Fish processing results in large amounts of solid and liquid wastes that are unsustainably dumped into oceans and landfills. Alternative sustainable technologies that completely utilize seafood wastes are needed. Hydrothermal carbonization (HTC) that converts moisture-rich biomass into hydrochar is mostly employed for pure lignocellulosic biowaste. However, the suitability of HTC for pure non-lignocellulosic waste is unknown. Here, for the first time, a response surface design guided optimization of microwave hydrothermal carbonization (MHTC) process parameters, holding temperature (150–210 °C) and time (90–120 min), showed that a temperature of approximately 200 °C and a time of approximately 119 min yielded maximal hydrochar (∼34%). The atomic carbon and ash content, and calorific value of hydrochar were approximately 25–57%, 20–28%, and 19–24.5 MJ/kg respectively, depending on the MHTC operating conditions. Taken together, these results confirm that MHTC produces hydrochar from fish waste of quality comparable to one produced from certain lignocellulosic, sewage and municipal wastes. Therefore, this strategy presents an exciting alternative technology that can be used either independently or in combination with other valorization techniques to completely utilize fish wastes irrespective of their quality.","","Available from http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.wasman.2017.04.016","","","","United States","2017-07-15T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: Waste Management; Journal Volume: 65; Other Information: Copyright (c) 2017 Elsevier Science B.V., Amsterdam, The Netherlands, All rights reserved.; Country of input: International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA)","","Medium: X; Size: page(s) 159-168","","","","Journal ID: ISSN 0956-053X; CODEN: WAMAE2; PII: S0956-053X(17)30235-0; TRN: US17R4355093050","10.1016/J.WASMAN.2017.04.016","","2019-03-08T00:00:00Z","22742106","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/22742106","","Waste Management","","65"

One of the functions of the containment is to assist in the decontamination of aerosolized radioactive particles through both 'passive' or natural processes and 'active' or mechanical processes. Current United States Nuclear Regulatory Commission (NRC) guidance (Reg. guide 1.183) allows the use of aerosol natural deposition correlations to quantify postaccident nuclear containment decontamination factors. Large Light Water Reactor (LLWR) correlations have previously been developed to quantify the contribution of natural phenomena to post-accident aerosol decontamination. Specific correlations must similarly be developed to support the safety analyses of Small Modular Reactors (SMRs). For LLWR plants, decontamination is achieved 'actively' by mechanical systems such as containment sprays and 'passively' via natural phenomena such as gravitational settling, condensation, impaction, thermophoresis, diffusiophoresis and hygroscopic effects. Integrated pressurized water reactor (iPWR) SMR designs do not have containment sprays; therefore, they rely primarily on passive natural phenomena for decontamination in the integrated reactor vessel. Analytical studies and inferences from LLWR test data suggest that the smaller containment vessel volume to surface area ratio, coupled with the thermal hydraulic properties of iPWR plants, would significantly enhance decontamination factors for these smaller designs. The research aims to quantify the amount of decontamination from natural phenomena for the range of iPWR physical and thermal hydraulic characteristics. A preliminary assessment has shown that diffusiophoresis, thermophoresis and hygroscopic effects are the major areas with a research gap for iPWR plants; hence these areas are the foci of the research. These first-of-a-kind experiments will be described and preliminary analytical results will be presented that show the expected effects of SMR-specific correlations on passive decontamination of aerosolized radionuclides.","","","","","","United States","2017-07-01T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","Conference","Journal Name: Transactions of the American Nuclear Society; Journal Volume: 116; Conference: 2017 Annual Meeting of the American Nuclear Society, San Francisco, CA (United States), 11-15 Jun 2017; Other Information: Country of input: France; 2 refs.; available from American Nuclear Society - ANS, 555 North Kensington Avenue, La Grange Park, IL 60526 (US)","","Medium: X; Size: page(s) 760-762","","","","Journal ID: ISSN 0003-018X; TRN: US21V3045090634","","","2021-11-02T00:00:00Z","23050249","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/23050249","","Transactions of the American Nuclear Society","","116"

The POC consists of an inner Pipe Container (PC) surrounded by organic fiber dunnage inside of a 7A drum. The PC was design to maintain separation of fissile material and to provide shielding from radiation. The POC has many design features that are similar to Type B packages that do provide protection from engulfing fires. However, it was not specifically designed to prevent release of stored material during a long-duration fire. POCs are now being used to store combustible TRU waste at Department of Energy (DOE) sites (e.g., Waste Isolation Pilot Plant). Radioactive waste storage operators would like to be able to claim some level of protection is provided by the POCs for thermal assaults that could occur within storage facilities when these POCs contain PCs with combustibles. In 1997 Sandia National Laboratories (SNL) conducted a series of tests to determine the degree of protection POCs provide during storage accident events. One of these tests exposed four of the POCs to a 30-minute engulfing pool fire, resulting in one of the 7A drums generating sufficient internal pressure to pop off its lid and expose the top of the PC to the fire environment. However, these tests are not bounding for POC/PC containing combustibles. With the addition of combustible materials in the PC, the possibility exists for generation of higher quantities of gases and much higher pressures inside the PC, which can lead to early rupture of the PC filter and higher radioactive aerosol release fractions. Therefore, a new series of tests was required to determine the temperature response of the exposed PC and determine the amount of material that could be released. DOE contacted SNL in 2015 to discuss the 1997 SNL tests and came to the conclusion that those tests were not bounding for POC/PC containing combustibles Therefore, DOE commission a new set of tests at SNL. Starting in 2015, SNL conducted fire tests to examine whether the contents of the PC would reach a temperature that would result in generation of sufficient gas to cause overpressurization of the PC, and subsequent release of its content. This paper will describe the various test conducted thus far, and present preliminary results from these tests.","","","","","","United States","2017-07-01T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","Conference","Journal Name: Transactions of the American Nuclear Society; Journal Volume: 116; Conference: 2017 Annual Meeting of the American Nuclear Society, San Francisco, CA (United States), 11-15 Jun 2017; Other Information: Country of input: France; 2 refs.; available from American Nuclear Society - ANS, 555 North Kensington Avenue, La Grange Park, IL 60526 (US)","","Medium: X; Size: page(s) 779-782","","","","Journal ID: ISSN 0003-018X; TRN: US21V3051090640","","","2021-11-02T00:00:00Z","23050255","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/23050255","","Transactions of the American Nuclear Society","","116"

The decommissioning of a nuclear power plant (NPP) which is licensed under chap. 7 of the German Atomic Energy Act, following the post-operational phase requires a comprehensive licensing procedure including in particular radiation protection aspects and possible impacts to the environment. Decommissioning requires a decommissioning license. This will include essential changes in requirements for the systems and components and will mainly lead to the immediate dismantling of the nuclear power plant which is now the only permitted decommissioning strategy in Germany. In this context, neutron activation calculations for the structural components of KKP1 and GKN I have to be carried out to predict occurring activities and to estimate future costs for conditioning and packaging. To avoid an overestimation of the radioactive inventory and to calculate the expenses for decommissioning as accurate as possible, modern state-of-the-art Monte-Carlo-Techniques (MCNP6) combined with automated variance reduction tools (ADAVANTG) are used and are coupled with the activation and decay module ORIGEN-S.

Its operation will end in 2019. To support the decommissioning planning, a map with the overall distribution of relevant radionuclides has to be created according to the state of the art. The activation analysis comprises all load periods until the planned shutdown. A procedure for an activation calculation of the pool structure of the BER-II research reactor including the concrete shielding is presented. With the combination of the options offered by MCNP6 and PARTISN, an effective method to compute the neutron flux for a reactor geometry model with 2,790,000 cells could be achieved. The fact that for calculations with PARTISN some extra effort to generate the XS is needed is more than compensated by the fact that for all volumes of the model, neutron fluxes are produced that can be subsequently used for the activation calculation. With the power history provided together with the material compositions, an activation map was created for the whole structure, even for the most remote parts. The activity can be calculated for all nuclides of the FISPACT library. Depending on material and irradiation history, however, only a limited number of nuclides must be regarded to reduce the size of activation data base. The results for the activation at calibration points give an example that the use of detailed calculation methods allows reliable estimation of the activity of relevant nuclides. The mean and the maximum activity can be determined. For a more detailed analysis, it is desirable to provide some more calibration points and realistic material specifications including impurities where the results of the activation can be validated, especially for more remote regions of the concrete structures.","","","","","","United States","2017-07-01T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","Conference","Journal Name: Transactions of the American Nuclear Society; Journal Volume: 116; Conference: 2017 Annual Meeting of the American Nuclear Society, San Francisco, CA (United States), 11-15 Jun 2017; Other Information: Country of input: France; 6 refs.; available from American Nuclear Society - ANS, 555 North Kensington Avenue, La Grange Park, IL 60526 (US)","","Medium: X; Size: page(s) 970-973","","","","Journal ID: ISSN 0003-018X; TRN: US21V3093090682","","","2021-11-02T00:00:00Z","23050297","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/23050297","","Transactions of the American Nuclear Society","","116"
"Evaluation of Rapid for a UNF cask benchmark problem","Mascolino, Valerio; Haghighat, Alireza; Roskof, Nathan J.","12 MANAGEMENT OF RADIOACTIVE WASTES, AND NON-RADIOACTIVE WASTES FROM NUCLEAR FACILITIES; 42 ENGINEERING; ACCURACY; BENCHMARKS; COMPUTERIZED SIMULATION; CRITICALITY; EIGENVALUES; FISSION; MONTE CARLO METHOD; NUCLEAR FUELS; PERFORMANCE; RADIOACTIVE WASTE MANAGEMENT; RADIONUCLIDE MIGRATION; RESPONSE FUNCTIONS; SAMPLING; SENSITIVITY ANALYSIS; SPENT FUEL CASKS","To ensure criticality safety and maintain a high level of security of Used Nuclear Fuel (UNF), it is necessary to perform detailed Particle Transport simulations. The commonly used technique is the 3-D, continuous energy Monte Carlo method that is time-consuming and, for eigenvalue calculations, may have difficulties with the source convergence. Wenner and Haghighat and Dufek demonstrated that in criticality problems with high dominance ratio and/or under-sampling possibilities, the fission matrix (FM) methodology should be used in order to be able to obtain unbiased solution. The RAPID (Real-time Analysis for Particle transport and In-situ Detection) code system is based on the Multi-stage Response-function Transport (MRT) methodology, and uses the FM formulation to determine eigenvalue, subcritical multiplication and fission density distribution of nuclear systems. This paper uses a benchmark problem similar to the GBC-32 Cask to evaluate the accuracy and performance of RAPID against the results of a reference MCNP solution. We performed a detailed sensitivity analysis on a single-assembly model in order to determine the MCNP eigenvalue parameters necessary to obtain a reliable reference solution. These results provided a guide for the selection of an appropriate set of parameters for the eigenvalue calculation for the whole cask. The paper is organized as follows: initially, the RAPID code system is briefly discussed; then, the benchmark problem is introduced. The methodology used to analyze results is proposed and some of the results of different cases are analyzed to identify the best set of eigenvalue parameters for a reference MCNP calculation. The selected case is then compared with the RAPID calculation for both a single assembly and a full cask model. In the end some conclusions and future work perspectives are drawn.","","","","","","United States","2017-07-01T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","Conference","Journal Name: Transactions of the American Nuclear Society; Journal Volume: 116; Conference: 2017 Annual Meeting of the American Nuclear Society, San Francisco, CA (United States), 11-15 Jun 2017; Other Information: Country of input: France; 9 refs.; available from American Nuclear Society - ANS, 555 North Kensington Avenue, La Grange Park, IL 60526 (US)","","Medium: X; Size: page(s) 989-992","","","","Journal ID: ISSN 0003-018X; TRN: US21V3097090686","","","2021-11-02T00:00:00Z","23050301","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/23050301","","Transactions of the American Nuclear Society","","116"

It also enables current commercial PWRs to have high core power density. Despite its outstanding advantages, the soluble boron raises several significant concerns such as soluble boron-induced corrosion of structures, a large amount of liquid waste generation, and a possibility of positive moderator temperature coefficient (MTC) at high boron concentration. These concerns become more serious as the concentration of boron becomes higher. Therefore boron in the primary coolant has been a hindrance to the power uprate and cycle extension operation of PWRs. Currently a government-supported research project is underway to develop technologies for the soluble-boron-free (SBF) operation of a PWR-type small modular reactor (SMR). This paper presents preliminary results of the SBF SMR core reactivity control methods including optimization of burnable absorbers (BA) and control rod design, and development of secondary shutdown system (SSS)","","","","","","United States","2017-07-01T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","Conference","Journal Name: Transactions of the American Nuclear Society; Journal Volume: 116; Conference: 2017 Annual Meeting of the American Nuclear Society, San Francisco, CA (United States), 11-15 Jun 2017; Other Information: Country of input: France; 7 refs.; available from American Nuclear Society - ANS, 555 North Kensington Avenue, La Grange Park, IL 60526 (US)","","Medium: X; Size: page(s) 1027-1029","","","","Journal ID: ISSN 0003-018X; TRN: US21V3107090696","","","2021-11-02T00:00:00Z","23050311","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/23050311","","Transactions of the American Nuclear Society","","116"

These modeling efforts are performed by the vendor to demonstrate the performance as well as regulatory compliance and are independently verified by the Nuclear Regulatory Commission (NRC). The majority of commercial dry storage casks in use today are aboveground. Cooling of the assemblies located inside the sealed canister is achieved by naturally-convective air flowing in the bottom of the cask and exiting out the top. Carefully measured data sets generated from testing of full sized casks or smaller cask analogs are widely recognized as vital for validating design and performance models. Numerous studies have been previously conducted. Recent advances in dry storage cask designs have significantly increased the maximum thermal load allowed in a cask in part by increasing the efficiency of internal conduction pathways and by increasing the internal convection through greater canister helium pressure. These vertical, canistered cask systems rely on ventilation between the canister and the overpack to convect heat away from the canister to the environment for both above and belowground configurations. While several testing programs have been previously conducted, these earlier validation efforts did not capture the effects of elevated helium pressures or accurately portray the external convection of aboveground and belowground canistered dry cask systems. Thus the enhanced performance of modern dry storage casks cannot be fully validated using previous studies.","","","","","","United States","2017-07-01T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","Conference","Journal Name: Transactions of the American Nuclear Society; Journal Volume: 116; Conference: 2017 Annual Meeting of the American Nuclear Society, San Francisco, CA (United States), 11-15 Jun 2017; Other Information: Country of input: France; 10 refs.; available from American Nuclear Society - ANS, 555 North Kensington Avenue, La Grange Park, IL 60526 (US)","","Medium: X; Size: page(s) 1330-1333","","","","Journal ID: ISSN 0003-018X; TRN: US21V3182090771","","","2021-11-02T00:00:00Z","23050386","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/23050386","","Transactions of the American Nuclear Society","","116"

The underwater facility is integrally designed as a wet SNF storage system with a chemically-controlled water pool. The SNF storage racks are seismically qualified. The L-Basin pool holds about 3.4 million gallons of water with concrete wall thickness of about 5 ft and water depths of 17 ft to 30 ft. The facility has mainly two different elevation levels of 30 ft and 17 ft below the ground level. At the level 30 ft below the ground, a maximum of 110 racks of VTS and 5 racks of Dry Cave can be stored. At the level of 17 ft below the ground, 120 HFIR cores can be stored, considering that each rack contains two HFIR cores. In case of a hypothetical accident, all cooling water in the storage pool may be drained away, resulting in dry SNF storage condition. The primary objective of the work is to estimate the maximum fuel temperature in a conservative manner when the L-Basin facility is completely dry due to the hypothetical drain-down of the pool water. A three-dimensional Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) modeling approach was taken for the thermal evaluations of the water-drained SNF storage facility. The modeling calculations were performed, assuming that all of the storage racks in L-Basin are fully loaded with SNF assemblies containing decay heat sources. In the case of full loading, the L-Basin facility stores 14,600 SNF assemblies in VTS racks and 120 cores in HFIR racks. The thermal analysis results of the L-Basin model yielded maximum temperatures of VTS and HFIR fuel assemblies for different fuel loading scenarios and boundary conditions of the SNF storage racks.","","","","","","United States","2017-07-01T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","Conference","Journal Name: Transactions of the American Nuclear Society; Journal Volume: 116; Conference: 2017 Annual Meeting of the American Nuclear Society, San Francisco, CA (United States), 11-15 Jun 2017; Other Information: Country of input: France; 7 refs.; available from American Nuclear Society - ANS, 555 North Kensington Avenue, La Grange Park, IL 60526 (US)","","Medium: X; Size: page(s) 1447-1450","","","","Journal ID: ISSN 0003-018X; TRN: US21V3208090797","","","2021-11-02T00:00:00Z","23050412","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/23050412","","Transactions of the American Nuclear Society","","116"

Also as demand for NPP decommissioning increase, the generation of large amount of radioactive waste and environment contamination are expected. Based on the decommissioning experiences of nuclear facilities, it is recognized that the specific design and operational procedure are essentially required to minimize the radioactive waste generation and radiation exposure during decommissioning. Recently the legal framework of decommissioning in Korea was enhanced through the revision of Nuclear Safety Act (NSA) and its subordinate status in 2015. On the other hand, the Korean first NPP, Kori unit 1, will be scheduled permanently shut-down in mid-2017. The Korean regulatory body have experience for decommissioning of small-sized nuclear facilities like research reactors and nuclear fuel cycle facility. However we have no experience on decommissioning of NPP in Korea. Therefore the comprehensive and systematic technical standards and guidelines on safety review and inspection should be required for the Korean first case on decommissioning of NPP. According to the revised NSA, NPP operators in Korea should submit the decommissioning plan (DP) for the permanent shut-down NPP as well as the existing operating NPPs. The operator shall prepare and submit the design features and measures for decommissioning facilitation as one of DP items and regulatory body shall review the feasibility of decommissioning. Therefore the safety review guideline for those decommissioning facilitation should be required. In this paper, we studied the overseas safety requirements, design features and operational procedures for decommissioning facilitation. Through the overseas survey results, the regulatory position and major management plan were proposed for development of detailed implementation guideline on decommissioning facilitation of NPPs in Korea.","","","","","","United States","2017-07-01T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","Conference","Journal Name: Transactions of the American Nuclear Society; Journal Volume: 116; Conference: 2017 Annual Meeting of the American Nuclear Society, San Francisco, CA (United States), 11-15 Jun 2017; Other Information: Country of input: France; 9 refs.; available from American Nuclear Society - ANS, 555 North Kensington Avenue, La Grange Park, IL 60526 (US)","","Medium: X; Size: page(s) 33-34","","","","Journal ID: ISSN 0003-018X; TRN: US21V2857087726","","","2021-11-01T00:00:00Z","23047341","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/23047341","","Transactions of the American Nuclear Society","","116"

In the planning stage, the dismantling scenario including dismantling equipment and processes has a significant effect on the cost and safety of the whole decommissioning. High level radiation of the dismantling object such as a reactor pressure vessel (RPV) and its internals restricts access by human workers, and makes an accident during the dismantling process more difficult to deal with. Decommissioning of nuclear facilities demand a large scale of budget and high level of safety, and therefore the preliminary verification of dismantling scenarios by graphical simulation has special importance at planning stage. In recent years, the manufacturing industry has aggressively adopted the virtual manufacturing technology to verify the facilities and processes with high efficiency. The virtual manufacturing technology was beginning to be adopted in the area of the nuclear facility decommissioning. The dismantling process of the Rotary Specimen Rack (RSR) in the Korea Research Reactor-1 and 2 was established and it was also applied to replace the steam generators on time and on budget in San Onofre Nuclear Generating Station. Current virtual manufacturing technologies are not sufficient for the area of nuclear facility decommissioning because the object segmenting function absolutely required for graphical simulations over various dismantling scenarios is unavailable. This paper proposes a new technology for graphical decommissioning simulator which is able to simulate various dismantling scenarios over nuclear facilities including repetitive object cuttings of heavy and complex structures by applying flexible cutting algorithm.","","","","","","United States","2017-07-01T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","Conference","Journal Name: Transactions of the American Nuclear Society; Journal Volume: 116; Conference: 2017 Annual Meeting of the American Nuclear Society, San Francisco, CA (United States), 11-15 Jun 2017; Other Information: Country of input: France; 4 refs.; available from American Nuclear Society - ANS, 555 North Kensington Avenue, La Grange Park, IL 60526 (US)","","Medium: X; Size: page(s) 35-37","","","","Journal ID: ISSN 0003-018X; TRN: US21V2858087727","","","2021-11-01T00:00:00Z","23047342","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/23047342","","Transactions of the American Nuclear Society","","116"

Previous simulation studies have shown that in the irradiated cladding, the major activation products found are {sup 125}Sb, {sup 60}Co, and {sup 99m}Nb, and the major fission product found is {sup 137}Cs. These radioisotopes make it impossible to treat the cladding as low level waste. A chlorination process has been proposed for zirconium reprocessing as it has been proven more efficient than previous mechanical processes, redox processes, and other chemical methods (e.g. iodination). In the chlorination process, zirconium alloy cladding reacts with Cl{sub 2} at 350- 380 deg. C to produce mainly ZrCl{sub 4}. The zirconium tetrachloride has a relatively low sublimation point (331 deg. C) that allows its separation from other products, and so it can be treated as low level waste for disposal or recycling. However, previous work has observed element impurities (iron, tin, chromium, cesium, antimony, and niobium) in the recovered ZrCl{sub 4}, meaning that additional steps are necessary in a chlorination process previous to the reduction of ZrCl, to metallic Zr. The emphasis of this research summary is on the progress that has been made to isolate and characterize the impurities produced after chlorination of three previously characterized non-irradiated zirconium alloys (Zircaloy-2, Zircaloy-4, and a commercial Zr-Nb alloy) widely used as cladding materials.","","","","","","United States","2017-07-01T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","Conference","Journal Name: Transactions of the American Nuclear Society; Journal Volume: 116; Conference: 2017 Annual Meeting of the American Nuclear Society, San Francisco, CA (United States), 11-15 Jun 2017; Other Information: Country of input: France; 5 refs.; available from American Nuclear Society - ANS, 555 North Kensington Avenue, La Grange Park, IL 60526 (US)","","Medium: X; Size: page(s) 63-66","","","","Journal ID: ISSN 0003-018X; TRN: US21V2861087730","","","2021-11-01T00:00:00Z","23047345","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/23047345","","Transactions of the American Nuclear Society","","116"

Zirconium alloys, including Zircaloy-4, Zircaloy-2 and Zr-Nb alloys (Zirlo{sup TM} and Zr-2.5Nb) are the most common fuel cladding materials in nuclear light water reactors (LWRs) due to their favorable mechanical properties, corrosion resistance, low thermal-neutron capture cross section and criticality. The United States produces a large amount of cladding material from used nuclear fuel, which could approach 1,000 MT/year in the next 50 years. In nuclear fuel recycling, spent nuclear fuel assemblies are disassembled and the cladding hulls are separated from the U oxide spent fuel. Zr can be recovered from Zr cladding using the chlorination method. However the presence of impurities in the recovered ZrCl{sub 4} was reported, including Sn, Cr and Fe. Thus, further efforts are necessary to improve the purification process significantly. This requires fundamental understanding of chlorination processes in cladding materials. Most of the material properties are expected to be similar between the pure zirconium and its alloys due to the fact that the alloy composition consists of more than 95 weight-percent zirconium and less than 2% of tin, niobium, iron, chromium, nickel and other metals. Therefore, while the overarching goal is to understand the chlorination process occurring in complex fuel cladding materials, chlorination of pure zirconium was used as an initial system for the modeling and simulation efforts in this study.","","","","","","United States","2017-07-01T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","Conference","Journal Name: Transactions of the American Nuclear Society; Journal Volume: 116; Conference: 2017 Annual Meeting of the American Nuclear Society, San Francisco, CA (United States), 11-15 Jun 2017; Other Information: Country of input: France; 14 refs.; available from American Nuclear Society - ANS, 555 North Kensington Avenue, La Grange Park, IL 60526 (US)","","Medium: X; Size: page(s) 69-71","","","","Journal ID: ISSN 0003-018X; TRN: US21V2864087733","","","2021-11-01T00:00:00Z","23047348","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/23047348","","Transactions of the American Nuclear Society","","116"

One process that may generate {sup 3}H-containing gaseous effluents is the recovery of zirconium from used fuel cladding. A chlorination process developed by Collins et al. is designed to convert the zirconium present in Zircaloy{sup R} cladding to recoverable ZrCl{sub 4}. The greatest economic benefit from including zirconium recycle as part of a larger used nuclear fuel (UNF) recycle effort would be a decrease in the disposal cost of used fuel cladding. Used fuel cladding is considered high-level waste (HLW). As zirconium is the second largest element by mass (25%) contained in most UNF assemblies (with uranium being the largest), recovery of the zirconium could result in a substantial decrease in the amount of HLW intended for geologic disposition. The reclaimed ZrCl{sub 4} product, if sufficiently free from radioactive impurities, could then be disposed of as low-level waste or reused in nuclear applications. The chlorination process uses chlorine gas (Cl{sub 2}) and an inert carrier such as argon (Ar) to convert the zirconium present in cladding to ZrCl{sub 4}. ZrCl{sub 4} is more volatile than other components in the cladding, causing evaporation of a relatively pure gaseous ZrCl{sub 4} stream. The product ZrCl{sub 4} is recovered as a solid salt by condensation when cooled to less than about 300 deg. C. A fraction of the {sup 3}H (0-96%) produced in nuclear fuel during irradiation is found in zirconium-based cladding, possibly as zirconium hydride (the wide range is a remnant of various researchers' analyses of cladding of various irradiations and cooling times). Heating the cladding to high temperatures, such as would be done during the chlorination process, will release the {sup 3}H. At the temperatures of the zirconium recycle process, the {sup 3}H is likely to react with excess Cl{sub 2} to produce tritiated HCl ({sup 3}HCl), although this could be avoided if the cladding and fuel were treated to remove {sup 3}H prior to chlorination. A previous analysis showed that the concentration of {sup 3}HCl in the off-gas of the zirconium recycle process will be in the range of parts per billion to a few parts per million. Should {sup 3}H mitigation be required for the zirconium recycle process, it will be completed through the abatement of {sup 3}HCl from this off-gas stream. The intent of the testing described in this summary was to conduct proof-of-principle demonstrations for two {sup 3}HCl removal methods. The zirconium recycle off-gas stream differs from many industrial HCl-containing streams in that the concentration of HCl requiring removal is extremely low. Demonstrations of HCl removal at ppm concentrations were not found in the literature, making the proof-of-principle approach attractive as a way to identify the most promising method for continued development. An important consideration throughout these experiments was that current research efforts on the zirconium recycle process are conducted in a hot cell and any {sup 3}HCl removal methods should be easily deployed in a hot-cell environment.","","","","","","United States","2017-07-01T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","Conference","Journal Name: Transactions of the American Nuclear Society; Journal Volume: 116; Conference: 2017 Annual Meeting of the American Nuclear Society, San Francisco, CA (United States), 11-15 Jun 2017; Other Information: Country of input: France; 4 refs.; available from American Nuclear Society - ANS, 555 North Kensington Avenue, La Grange Park, IL 60526 (US)","","Medium: X; Size: page(s) 72-75","","","","Journal ID: ISSN 0003-018X; TRN: US21V2865087734","","","2021-11-01T00:00:00Z","23047349","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/23047349","","Transactions of the American Nuclear Society","","116"

These radionuclides are {sup 3}H, {sup 14}C, {sup 85}Kr, and {sup 129}I. While iodine has been the focus of a number of studies due to the high decontamination factor (DF) requirements on multiple escape pathways, it is clear from prior studies that the control of tritium will also be a significant issue for future reprocessing plants, especially if processing relatively short-cooled fuels (<10 yr post-reactor discharge). Tritium contained in a used nuclear fuel (UNF) matrix will be released into the liquid and off-gas streams during fuel reprocessing. The amounts released into the process streams are a function of the type and burnup of the fuel processed and the chemical processes employed within the reprocessing plant. Previous studies have examined the tritium capture requirements for the reprocessing facility assuming that all of the tritium contained in the fuel matrix is volatilized in the head-end operations; i.e., tritium pretreatment is employed and tritium is completely released from the cladding. This scenario tends to limit the release pathway to the headend off-gas stream. Previous studies by Jubin and Spencer examined the accumulation and distribution of tritium in an aqueous-based reprocessing plant.","","","","","","United States","2017-07-01T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","Conference","Journal Name: Transactions of the American Nuclear Society; Journal Volume: 116; Conference: 2017 Annual Meeting of the American Nuclear Society, San Francisco, CA (United States), 11-15 Jun 2017; Other Information: Country of input: France; 5 refs.; available from American Nuclear Society - ANS, 555 North Kensington Avenue, La Grange Park, IL 60526 (US)","","Medium: X; Size: page(s) 76-77","","","","Journal ID: ISSN 0003-018X; TRN: US21V2866087735","","","2021-11-01T00:00:00Z","23047350","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/23047350","","Transactions of the American Nuclear Society","","116"

There are currently numerous sites in the world at which surface and groundwater are contaminated by nuclear weapon production and testing, as well as due to nuclear power plant accidents. Many of those sites remain unused or inhabited primarily due to public concern. Improving scientific and technical capabilities to develop environmental resiliency is critical not only to address existing contamination, but also to build public confidence and support for nuclear energy. One of the obstacles in remediation is to tackle a large volume of contaminated soil and groundwater with relatively low concentrations. Although many contaminant removal technologies have developed (e.g., pump-and-treat systems), they are often expensive and not cost-effective for low-concentration radionuclide contamination. Although soil removal is often the most effective, it produces a large amount of waste that has to be stored securely for a long period of time or treated at the special treatment facilities. Transporting a large amount of waste may also produce greenhouse gases and disrupt local communities. Recently, the concept of 'sustainable remediation' has been proposed to improve a remediation system as a whole, including the consideration of cost effectiveness, reduction of greenhouse emission, waste production and energy usage. Rather than just focusing on removing contaminants, the sustainable remediation highlights the use of passive remediation technologies to immobilize radionuclides along with the application of monitored natural attenuation and longer institutional control. However, such passive technologies and monitored natural attenuation require the increased burden of proof to ensure that those immobilized contaminants would not compromise the long-term public health. Although contaminant transport modeling and risk assessments are always performed, they sometimes fail due to the lack of understanding the contaminant transport proposes at the time of the risk assessment or due to some unexpected processes. Monitoring technologies are critical to ensure the long-term stability of such remediated sites, and also to address the public concerns. Recent advances in in situ sensor technologies and spatially-extensive mapping technologies (such as unmanned aerial vehicles, airborne mapping, geophysics) have improved monitoring of contamination over space and time. In addition to new sensing devices, data management and data analytics technologies have been expanded to manage and process large spatial and temporal datasets. Such technologies can be used to reduce monitoring cost significantly, and to facilitate long-term monitoring. In this study, we demonstrate our data analytics technologies for two nuclear-related contaminated sites: (1) air dose rate monitoring in Fukushima prefecture, and (2) groundwater monitoring at the Savannah River Site F-Area. We are developing the spatial and temporal data integration methodologies to integrate various spatially extensive data and time-series data for improving long-term monitoring. Such monitoring technologies and experiences at the existing contaminated sites can be transferred to build a better monitoring system for nuclear facilities, such as nuclear power plants or nuclear waste storages.","","","","","","United States","2017-07-01T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","Conference","Journal Name: Transactions of the American Nuclear Society; Journal Volume: 116; Conference: 2017 Annual Meeting of the American Nuclear Society, San Francisco, CA (United States), 11-15 Jun 2017; Other Information: Country of input: France; 4 refs.; available from American Nuclear Society - ANS, 555 North Kensington Avenue, La Grange Park, IL 60526 (US)","","Medium: X; Size: page(s) 105-106","","","","Journal ID: ISSN 0003-018X; TRN: US21V2872087741","","","2021-11-01T00:00:00Z","23047356","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/23047356","","Transactions of the American Nuclear Society","","116"

Only a few countries reprocess their civilian used fuel, notably France, Russia, and UK. No country has yet operated a geologic repository to dispose of civilian used fuel or high-level radioactive wastes (HLW). As a result, the management and disposal of used fuel and HLW are viewed as the Achilles' heel of nuclear power. Figure 1 shows the used fuel inventory in the United States (US) and East Asian nuclear power programs. The inventory is estimated based on that in 2010 and the projected growth of nuclear power in these programs to 2020 and 2030. Figure 1 indicates that in 2010, the US had about 63,900 tons of used fuel from light-water reactors (LWR), more than the statutory limit of what was supposed to go into the now-abandoned Yucca Mountain Repository, and accounting for more than 33% of global used LWR fuel total. Currently, about 2,000 tons of used fuel are generated in the existing US LWRs annually. Russia had 25,100 tons of used fuel in 2010. Based on a modest growth of nuclear power, its used fuel inventory is expected to increase to about 31,800 and 38,000 tons by 2020 and 2030, respectively. The nuclear energy programs in East Asia (China, Japan, ROK, and Taiwan) account for 19% of global used LWR fuel inventory in 2010. China's used fuel inventory in 2010 was relatively small at 1,900 tons, but is expected to grow rapidly to {approx}12,400 and {approx}31,000 tons in 2020 and 2030, respectively, based on its expanding nuclear power program (from the current installed capacity of 21.8 GW to {approx}60 and {approx}200 GW in 2020 and 2030, respectively). Besides PWRs, China also operates 2 Candu reactors which each produces roughly 8 times more used fuel in tons than a PWR of the same power. The used Candu fuel inventory would increase from 950 tons in 2010 to 2,850 and 4,750 tons in 2020 and 2030, respectively. Used fuel in Japan, ROK, and Taiwan are US-obligated. Japan's future trends of used fuel inventory are uncertain due to the unknown numbers and timing of the currently-shutdown nuclear power plants that would be allowed for restart, and the uncertain future of Japan's reprocessing at Rokkasho. Under two scenario cases (a no-nuke/no-reprocessing and a 80%-nuke with reprocessing), the Japanese used fuel inventory could be capped from 2020 to 2030 to {approx}21,500 tons for the first case, and to {approx}22,500 tons for the second. The ROK's used PWR fuel inventory would increase from 4,900 tons in 2010 to about 8,800 and 14,000 tons in 2020 and 2030, respectively. Its used Candu fuel inventory would also increase from 5,900 tons in 2010 to about 9,700 and 13,500 tons in 2020 and 2030, respectively. The Taiwan used fuel inventory should be kept at current level as nuclear power is being phase out. Its growth should be modest from 3,000 tons in 2010 to about 4,300 and 5,000 tons in 2020 and 2030, respectively even if the 4. nuclear power station would start and the operation of existing LWRs is extended. Used fuel inventory in other East Asian countries (DPRK, Vietnam, etc.) should be small, if any before 2030.","","","","","","United States","2017-07-01T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","Conference","Journal Name: Transactions of the American Nuclear Society; Journal Volume: 116; Conference: 2017 Annual Meeting of the American Nuclear Society, San Francisco, CA (United States), 11-15 Jun 2017; Other Information: Country of input: France; 7 refs.; available from American Nuclear Society - ANS, 555 North Kensington Avenue, La Grange Park, IL 60526 (US)","","Medium: X; Size: page(s) 107-109","","","","Journal ID: ISSN 0003-018X; TRN: US21V2873087742","","","2021-11-01T00:00:00Z","23047357","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/23047357","","Transactions of the American Nuclear Society","","116"

However, to take advantage of the inherent benefits, many hurdles must be overcome in order for nuclear power to achieve these expectations. One of the largest challenges faced, is the management of used nuclear fuel (UNF). Currently, no strategy has been identified to deal with the growing UNF problem, and so the UNF remains stored on site at nuclear power plants either in cooling pools or in dry cask storage. The amount of stored UNF continues to grow, and with it, so does the concern surrounding its long-term radiotoxicity. This material could be reprocessed to recover the actinides, maximizing the energy potential of the UNF and minimizing the waste generation. Not only do U and Pu, the major energy producing actinides, need to be recovered, but recovering Np and Am would make waste generated from reprocessing significantly safer for long-term storage in a geological repository. There are a number of methods currently in use to reprocess UNF; throughout Europe, the Purex process is widely implemented, while the Japanese have developed the Next process. The Next process removes a bulk of the U by crystallization prior to a Purex-like separation scheme. In the Next process, it is undesirable to have any other species removed from solution in the crystallization step, but rather, the goal is to obtain a pure uranyl nitrate hexahydrate (UNH) product. Alternatively, a group separation of U-Am by a crystallization process would provide an elegant solution. Such a process has become attainable with the renewed interest in accessing Am(VI) in nitric acid solutions. In order to synthesize and stabilize Am(VI) which has only been demonstrated on a limited basis, a highly oxidizing system is required. By oxidizing Np, Pu, and Am to their hexavalent state, they can be co-crystallized with UNH, and thereby removed from solution. Recent results have demonstrated that all the hexavalent actinide (An) species are removed from solution in near proportion, by a simple reduction of temperature in 6-8 M HNO{sub 3}.","","","","","","United States","2017-07-01T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","Conference","Journal Name: Transactions of the American Nuclear Society; Journal Volume: 116; Conference: 2017 Annual Meeting of the American Nuclear Society, San Francisco, CA (United States), 11-15 Jun 2017; Other Information: Country of input: France; 6 refs.; available from American Nuclear Society - ANS, 555 North Kensington Avenue, La Grange Park, IL 60526 (US)","","Medium: X; Size: page(s) 121-122","","","","Journal ID: ISSN 0003-018X; TRN: US21V2876087745","","","2021-11-01T00:00:00Z","23047360","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/23047360","","Transactions of the American Nuclear Society","","116"

One of the key processes in pyro-processing is an electro-refiner (ER) where the metallic fission products are loaded into an anode basket and dissolved into lithium-potassium chloride (LiCl-KCl) eutectic salt at 773 K. Many researchers have been exploring the fundamental characterizations of U in LiCl-KCl system by using various electrochemical methods, resulting in several reported values of diffusion coefficient, apparent standard potential, and activity coefficient of U in the salt system. In addition, several researchers measured kinetic parameter of U (exchange current density, i{sub 0}) by using Tafel and linear polarization (LP) methods. Despite available data sets on this ternary salt system, there are discrepancies due to different experimental conditions, design, size of the cell, and measurement techniques. In addition, the i{sub 0} for U/U{sup 3+} reaction has only been measured since 2009; therefore, only few data sets are available to date although the i{sub 0} is critical for the development of dynamic ER model. The value of i{sub 0} is a kinetic characteristic in an ideal equilibrium state; therefore, it is very challenging to be measured by experiments. The authors have estimated the values of i{sub 0} via Tafel and linear polarization methods (LP); however, these methods are lack of maintaining electrode surface area during the measurements. In addition, some data are not following the trends from other literature studies due to its difficulties of the measurement. Therefore, further experimental determinations have to be accomplished to understand the i{sub 0} kinetics and the database for the i{sub 0} of U/U{sup 3+} couple in LiCl-KCl eutectic salt needs to be established systematically. In the present study, an experimental setup was designed and used in a consistent manner to build a meaningful database for U in LiCl-KCl system. LiCl-KCl-UCl{sub 3} salt was prepared at different concentrations and temperatures ranging from 0.5 wt% to 4 wt% and 723 K to 798 K, respectively. Then, CV, open circuit potential (OCP), and electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) were performed to understand the electrochemical, thermodynamic, and kinetic properties of U. Specially, i{sub 0} values have not been measured via EIS method; therefore, this study provides a good chance to confirm the i{sub 0} values with the new technique.","","","","","","United States","2017-07-01T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","Conference","Journal Name: Transactions of the American Nuclear Society; Journal Volume: 116; Conference: 2017 Annual Meeting of the American Nuclear Society, San Francisco, CA (United States), 11-15 Jun 2017; Other Information: Country of input: France; 16 refs.; available from American Nuclear Society - ANS, 555 North Kensington Avenue, La Grange Park, IL 60526 (US)","","Medium: X; Size: page(s) 151-154","","","","Journal ID: ISSN 0003-018X; TRN: US21V2884087753","","","2021-11-01T00:00:00Z","23047368","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/23047368","","Transactions of the American Nuclear Society","","116"

The most researched Generation IV reactor is the sodium cooled fast reactor (SFR). Improved engineering is has allowed for systematic improvements in both the safety and efficiency of power production. However, before a SFR can be brought back online in the Untied States, constructive research must be pursued on numerous scales to ensure the capabilities of aforementioned reactors. While larger research facilities such as the one at Argonne National Laboratory or the University of Wisconsin - Madison address some of the larger scale studies surrounding the SFR, Fort Lewis College (FLC) is aiming to provide small scale studies on liquid sodium as a thermal hydraulic cooling system. The sodium diagnostic loop at FLC is constructed to conduct research that includes: analyzing pumping characteristics, thermal stratification, freeze plug analysis, and corrosion studies. The FLC loop is attached to an inert glovebox so these experiments can be conducted with an additional layer of safety. The objective of this sodium research apparatus is to combine the best features of each instrument commonly associated with sodium research loops in a cost effective manner while still obtaining high fidelity data.

The target waste form will be zeolite loaded with metallic elements from the salt bound together by glass. Since the presence of I-129 and possibly Cl-36 will have a significant effect on long-term dose associated with the waste form, the ability to separate these halides and either recycle or dispose of them in special engineered waste forms is deemed attractive. A new method has been proposed to achieve this dechlorination involving the ion-exchange reaction between molten chloride ER salt and the protonated Y zeolite. Halides such as Cl and I should off-gas as HCl or HI, which can then be separated and decomposed into Cl{sub 2} and I{sub 2}, respectively. The Cl{sub 2} gas can either be captured and disposed of, or recycled to the electrometallurgical process. Initial experiments have been completed to determine the optimal zeolite drying temperature and to demonstrate ion exchange with non-optimized conditions. Further study in the future will strive to improve the kinetics of the ion-exchange reaction and to maximize the removal of the chlorine.","","","","","","United States","2017-07-01T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","Conference","Journal Name: Transactions of the American Nuclear Society; Journal Volume: 116; Conference: 2017 Annual Meeting of the American Nuclear Society, San Francisco, CA (United States), 11-15 Jun 2017; Other Information: Country of input: France; 1 ref.; available from American Nuclear Society - ANS, 555 North Kensington Avenue, La Grange Park, IL 60526 (US)","","Medium: X; Size: page(s) 165-166","","","","Journal ID: ISSN 0003-018X; TRN: US21V2888087757","","","2021-11-01T00:00:00Z","23047372","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/23047372","","Transactions of the American Nuclear Society","","116"

The equipment required to carry out voltammetry analysis include only a potentiostat and three electrodes, which can be placed in-situ.","","","","","","United States","2017-07-01T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","Conference","Journal Name: Transactions of the American Nuclear Society; Journal Volume: 116; Conference: 2017 Annual Meeting of the American Nuclear Society, San Francisco, CA (United States), 11-15 Jun 2017; Other Information: Country of input: France; 3 refs.; available from American Nuclear Society - ANS, 555 North Kensington Avenue, La Grange Park, IL 60526 (US)","","Medium: X; Size: page(s) 167","","","","Journal ID: ISSN 0003-018X; TRN: US21V2889087758","","","2021-11-01T00:00:00Z","23047373","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/23047373","","Transactions of the American Nuclear Society","","116"
"First-Principles-Based Computational Study on Nucleation and Growth Mechanisms of U on Mo(110) Surface Solvated in an Eutectic LiCl-KCl Molten Salt","Kwon, Choah; Kang, Joonhee; Han, Byungchan","12 MANAGEMENT OF RADIOACTIVE WASTES, AND NON-RADIOACTIVE WASTES FROM NUCLEAR FACILITIES; 38 RADIATION CHEMISTRY, RADIOCHEMISTRY AND NUCLEAR CHEMISTRY; ACTINIDES; AQUEOUS SOLUTIONS; CATHODES; COMPUTERIZED SIMULATION; DENSITY FUNCTIONAL METHOD; EFFICIENCY; ELECTROCHEMISTRY; ELECTROREFINING; EUTECTICS; FISSION FRAGMENTS; HIGH-LEVEL RADIOACTIVE WASTES; KINETICS; LITHIUM CHLORIDES; MOLECULAR DYNAMICS METHOD; MOLTEN SALTS; NON-PROLIFERATION TREATY; POTASSIUM CHLORIDES; POTENTIAL ENERGY; SPENT FUELS; THERMAL CONDUCTIVITY","In nuclear engineering and industry electrochemical methods have been intensively employed in pyro-processing technology to recycle used nuclear fuels for substantial alleviation of the concern with the safe treatment of high-level radioactive nuclear wastes. Pyro-processing is based on sequential electrochemical reactions at high temperature (typically above 700 K at ambient pressure) to enhance the efficiency for decoupling nuclear fuels from unfavorable fission fragments. Using a molten salt in electrorefining process, at which actinides can be selectively deposited in solid cathode from ionic states, gives several advantages over an aqueous solution: higher thermal conductivity (it is liquid phase at high temperature, molten salt plays a role as medium at high temperature over 773 K in electrochemical reaction, lower kinetic barrier in ionic diffusion mobility and better stability against undesired side reactions with radioactive materials. Therefore, the volume of high-level nuclear wastes to be, otherwise, disposed into secured sites is dramatically reduced. Most of all it conforms to nuclear non-proliferation treaty. Electrochemical reactions in a molten salt medium are, however, much more complicated than in aqueous solution rendering the accurate understanding of thermodynamic and kinetic properties formidably challenging. It is represented by extensive researches in experiments and computations to identify underlying mechanisms on how U and other fission fragments behave in the electrorefining system. Regardless of the researches there is a general agreement that the initial stage of the nucleation and growth process of the U deposit is critical for determining the properties of final product and the electrorefining efficiency. In spite of the focused studies it still remains unclear. Theoretical and computational researches have been often carried out with various empirical parameter for interatomic potential energy, which are unknown variables until numerical fits to experimental measurements or just assumption is made. Thus, empirical simulations sometimes predicted outcomes are inconsistent depending on materials of interest with experimental measurements. This may be largely because the accuracy of an empirical interatomic potential energy models critically depends on the input parameters and thus, can be limited in transferability of the results. Furthermore, it may be devoid of fundamental physics or chemistry. This situation requires special caution when an electrorefining system is studied to recycle spent nuclear fuels because of the extreme difficulty in reliable acquisition of thermodynamic and kinetic data from direct experimental measurements. In this presentation, we extensively utilized first principles density functional theory (DFT) calculations and ab-initio molecular dynamic (AIMD) simulations to figure out underlying mechanisms of the initial stage of nucleation and growth behaviors of U on Mo(110) surface in a eutectic LiCl-KCl molten salt at T = 773 K. To rigorously investigate the effect of the molten salt electrolyte we compared the results with those calculated under vacuum condition.","","","","","","United States","2017-07-01T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","Conference","Journal Name: Transactions of the American Nuclear Society; Journal Volume: 116; Conference: 2017 Annual Meeting of the American Nuclear Society, San Francisco, CA (United States), 11-15 Jun 2017; Other Information: Country of input: France; 1 refs.; available from American Nuclear Society - ANS, 555 North Kensington Avenue, La Grange Park, IL 60526 (US)","","Medium: X; Size: page(s) 178-181","","","","Journal ID: ISSN 0003-018X; TRN: US21V2893087762","","","2021-11-01T00:00:00Z","23047377","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/23047377","","Transactions of the American Nuclear Society","","116"

During the long storage life of the fuel, intermediate handling and transportation activities may take place that can create concerns regarding fuel integrity (safety) and continuity of knowledge (safeguards and security). Accidents and natural disasters also contribute to this concern. The reliable and safe management of used nuclear fuel is among the critical tasks to be addressed for the advancement of fission-based nuclear energy in the United States and elsewhere. Since the early 1950's, when the first nuclear power plant began to produce electricity, approximately 65,000 metric tons of used nuclear fuel have been generated in the United States. The postponement of the opening of a permanent repository until 2048 will lead to increased used fuel accumulation at reactor sites. A rapid increase in storage installations with more than 9,000 casks storing {approx}420,000 assemblies is anticipated by 2050 even if no new nuclear power plants are built. After used nuclear fuel has been placed inside a cask, the cask is sealed, not allowing for visual inspection. Conventional methods, e.g., x-rays, are limited in that they cannot penetrate dense, well-shielded objects. More sophisticated techniques, such as penetrating neutrons or proton radiography, require the use of an expensive accelerator. Efforts by Ziock et al. using neutron and gamma-ray imagers concluded that '...the signatures are deemed insufficient to uniquely identify individual casks of the same type...'. It was found that the gamma-ray and neutron images were dominated by diffusion and thermalization effects resulting from the large amount of shielding. One promising mode of inspection would use cosmic-ray muons. These muons are naturally generated, are able to penetrate dense materials, and are incident from all directions above the horizon. Tomography performed using these muons could potentially provide efficient, inexpensive, remote assessment of used nuclear fuel. However, current muon applications are limited in that they have not included momentum measurement. If momentum measurement could be incorporated, that would represent a big step forward because it would allow more accurate estimation of the muon observables, e.g., scattering variance. This approach has the potential to reconstruct the contents of a cask with improved resolution and identify partial defects, fuel assemblies, and individual fuel rods.","","","","","","United States","2017-07-01T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","Conference","Journal Name: Transactions of the American Nuclear Society; Journal Volume: 116; Conference: 2017 Annual Meeting of the American Nuclear Society, San Francisco, CA (United States), 11-15 Jun 2017; Other Information: Country of input: France; 12 refs.; available from American Nuclear Society - ANS, 555 North Kensington Avenue, La Grange Park, IL 60526 (US)","","Medium: X; Size: page(s) 190-193","","","","Journal ID: ISSN 0003-018X; TRN: US21V2896087765","","","2021-11-01T00:00:00Z","23047380","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/23047380","","Transactions of the American Nuclear Society","","116"

Today, there is an increased demand for lower environmental affection and higher safety assurances within all industries dealing with radioactivity. The resulting increasing costs for dealing with radioactive waste, altogether with the pressure of public opinion, are strong motivation factors for the development of recycling schemes, softening the effects on the environment, and bringing economic advantages for the nuclear industry. This problem is even multiplied as a significant wave of decommissioning of nuclear facilities can be expected in the next decades and it makes the problem even more urgent. The Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development/Nuclear Energy Agency estimates that 400 nuclear power plants will have to be decommissioned between 2014 and 2050 and it will generate more than 5 million tons of radioactive scrap metal. If the decommissioning of other nuclear installations is taken into account, almost 30 million tons of scrap metal contaminated by radionuclides will need to be handled?1 According to an International Atomic Energy Agency report?2 during the nuclear facility decommissioning process, only 3 % of the material is considered contaminated, but costs for its disposal can make over 60 % of overall costs. In both of mentioned areas - SNF reprocessing and material decontamination - possible benefits of ionic liquids (ILs) are studied worldwide because of their interesting physical-chemical properties and chemical behavior. ILs (described as room-temperature molten salts in older literature) are commonly described as salts with organic cations associated with organic or inorganic anions that are liquid below 373 K and fully consisting of ions and offer advantages of nonaqueous processes like a safer environment because of substituting volatile and flammable organic solvents or less serious criticality issues. At the same time, ILs beat high-temperature molten salt in comparing energy costs. Also some other of ILs' unique properties are definitely attractive for areas of SNF reprocessing and solid waste decontamination. Among other major advantages of ionic liquids, negligible vapor pressure, non-flammability, chemical and mechanical stability, tunability as well as good electric conductivity or wide electrochemical window are usually being mentioned. In this contribution, the experimental verification of some principles needed for the development of the decontamination of material contaminated with uranium and europium are presented as model cases.","","","","","","United States","2017-07-01T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","Conference","Journal Name: Transactions of the American Nuclear Society; Journal Volume: 116; Conference: 2017 Annual Meeting of the American Nuclear Society, San Francisco, CA (United States), 11-15 Jun 2017; Other Information: Country of input: France; 3 refs.; available from American Nuclear Society - ANS, 555 North Kensington Avenue, La Grange Park, IL 60526 (US)","","Medium: X; Size: page(s) 194-196","","","","Journal ID: ISSN 0003-018X; TRN: US21V2897087766","","","2021-11-01T00:00:00Z","23047381","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/23047381","","Transactions of the American Nuclear Society","","116"

As time passes, the radioactivity of radioactive contaminated water has been lowered, but there is still some level of radioactive contamination. At present, decontamination of radioactive contaminated water uses a method of removing radioactive materials in polluted water by using resin or filter. This conventional decontamination method can lower the radioactive concentration of contaminated water to a certain level. However, it is difficult to reduce the amount of contaminated water to a level lower than the very low level due to technical and economic reasons. In this study, we propose a method to decontaminate water contaminated with radioactive materials using microalgae. In addition, a system for the treatment of radioactive contaminated water using microalgae has been conceptually designed.","","","","","","United States","2017-07-01T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","Conference","Journal Name: Transactions of the American Nuclear Society; Journal Volume: 116; Conference: 2017 Annual Meeting of the American Nuclear Society, San Francisco, CA (United States), 11-15 Jun 2017; Other Information: Country of input: France; 5 refs.; available from American Nuclear Society - ANS, 555 North Kensington Avenue, La Grange Park, IL 60526 (US)","","Medium: X; Size: page(s) 207-208","","","","Journal ID: ISSN 0003-018X; TRN: US21V2900087769","","","2021-11-01T00:00:00Z","23047384","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/23047384","","Transactions of the American Nuclear Society","","116"

The data visualization system is part of the Centralized Used Fuel Resource for Information Exchange (CURIE) website, hosted by the Oak Ridge National Laboratory (ORNL) for DOE-NE. The visualization employs a database that is part of an analysis tool known as the Used Nuclear Fuel Storage, Transportation and Disposal Analysis Resource and Data System (UNF-ST[and]DARDS). Because many of the previous document management and sharing tools related to SNF have been terminated (or are inaccessible), a new tool, the CURIE, was developed for DOE-NE and launched on March 1, 2013 at http://curie.ornl.gov. In addition to supporting DOE SNF programs, CURIE is a national resource that is accessible to industry, vendor, federal, and laboratory partners, as well as other stakeholders. CURIE's architecture was initially based on previous work that supported DOE's Bioenergy Technologies Office on the Bioenergy Knowledge Discovery Framework (KDF). The site uses an open-source search engine, Apache Solr, which provides intuitive search results based on a faceted search method similar to that used by Amazon.com{sup R}. This algorithm helps to ensure that finding documents and data is straightforward. SNF data visualization capability was added to the CURIE website which provides a capability to post and access documents and data related to the management of SNF. CURIE currently maintains over 4,100 documents and the Siting Experience Database (SED), which was developed in response to a near-term recommendation by the Blue Ribbon Commission on America's Nuclear Future (BRC). The SED is a database of the experience that has been gained and relevant documentation that has been produced in efforts to site nuclear waste facilities, both in the US and abroad. Most of these documents are publicly accessible. In addition, CURIE maintains a current calendar of related events, an SNF image gallery, featured documents, and external links to related databases and websites. CURIE also maintains private groups (or communities) to facilitate collaborative development through sharing and editing documents that are not publicly available. There are more than 250 registered users in 23 different communities within CURIE.ORNL has also been developing UNF-ST[and]DARDS to provide a controlled source of technical data for various waste management system analysis/evaluation tools, access to key technical data, and analysis capabilities for characterizing the SNF inventory. UNF-ST[and]DARDS also provides enhanced capabilities to assess safety, risk, and uncertainty throughout the integrated waste management system. This paper describes the UNF-ST[and]DARDS data available for visualization and the associated visualization techniques used by CURIE to display this data.","","","","","","United States","2017-07-01T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","Conference","Journal Name: Transactions of the American Nuclear Society; Journal Volume: 116; Conference: 2017 Annual Meeting of the American Nuclear Society, San Francisco, CA (United States), 11-15 Jun 2017; Other Information: Country of input: France; 9 refs.; available from American Nuclear Society - ANS, 555 North Kensington Avenue, La Grange Park, IL 60526 (US)","","Medium: X; Size: page(s) 225-228","","","","Journal ID: ISSN 0003-018X; TRN: US21V2904087773","","","2021-11-01T00:00:00Z","23047388","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/23047388","","Transactions of the American Nuclear Society","","116"
"Estimating Public Dose Along Hypothetical Spent Nuclear Fuel Transportation Routes","Connolly, Kevin J.","61 RADIATION PROTECTION AND DOSIMETRY; 12 MANAGEMENT OF RADIOACTIVE WASTES, AND NON-RADIOACTIVE WASTES FROM NUCLEAR FACILITIES; BACKGROUND RADIATION; EFFECTIVE RADIATION DOSES; GEOGRAPHIC INFORMATION SYSTEMS; NUCLEAR POWER PLANTS; RADIATION PROTECTION; RADIOACTIVE MATERIALS; REACTOR SHUTDOWN; REACTOR SITES; RECOMMENDATIONS; ROUTING; SHIELDS; SPENT FUEL CASKS; SPENT FUELS; STORAGE FACILITIES; WASTE STORAGE; WASTE TRANSPORTATION","In the future, it will be necessary to transport large quantities of spent nuclear fuel (SNF) from nuclear power plant sites to an interim storage facility (ISF) or a repository when such a facility is available. Because it is impossible to shield all of the radiation from this material, the general public will receive a very small, but quantifiable, dose from this transportation campaign. This paper describes the estimated collective effective radiation dose to the public due to SNF shipments under routine conditions and compares the estimated dose figures to the natural background radiation dose. To determine the estimated collective effective dose to the public, this analysis uses the US Department of Energy's (DOE) Stakeholder Tool for Assessing Radioactive Transportation (START), a geographic information system (GIS) routing tool, and a set of unit dose factors (UDFs) which were developed to calculate the estimated dose to the public along transportation routes. The estimated doses of radiation to which the public would be exposed during shipments of SNF is expected to be a consideration, along with many other factors, when making routing decisions. In all cases studied in this paper, estimated doses to the public will be orders of magnitude lower than the natural background radiation dose and will meet all US federal regulatory requirements for radiation dose/exposure to members of the public. The sample routes analyzed in this paper are expected to be representative of future SNF shipment routes in terms of length and mode of transportation, although they do not represent actual routes or destinations. This paper considers four routes from two shutdown reactor sites to two destinations. It must be noted that the specified origin sites are not necessarily the first sites under consideration for a de-inventory process. Further, the destination sites reviewed in this report are only to illustrate estimated dose figures along different routes and should not be taken as potential sites for an ISF or repository. For illustrative purposes only, the shortest distance rail route was found between each origin and destination point, and the collective effective dose to the public from the SNF cask was estimated along each route. This paper is not intended to make recommendations for routing decisions, but rather is intended to inform further discussion about the transportation of SNF and other radioactive materials.","","","","","","United States","2017-07-01T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","Conference","Journal Name: Transactions of the American Nuclear Society; Journal Volume: 116; Conference: 2017 Annual Meeting of the American Nuclear Society, San Francisco, CA (United States), 11-15 Jun 2017; Other Information: Country of input: France; 6 refs.; available from American Nuclear Society - ANS, 555 North Kensington Avenue, La Grange Park, IL 60526 (US)","","Medium: X; Size: page(s) 229-232","","","","Journal ID: ISSN 0003-018X; TRN: US21V2905087774","","","2021-11-01T00:00:00Z","23047389","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/23047389","","Transactions of the American Nuclear Society","","116"

The WIPP uses a ventilation system to ensure that underground air is circulated throughout the repository and to ensure that conditions are safe for the workers. Since the air in the repository exits to the surface through an exhaust shaft, this shaft is the sole potential pathway for airborne radioactivity release from the repository. During normal operations, exhaust air is released to the environment unfiltered. However, since the radiation release event, the WIPP ventilation system has been, and will likely remain in what is called 'filtration mode', (i.e., exhaust air is routed through a HEPA filter system). Redirection of the ventilation system through the HEPA (High Efficiency Particulate Air) filter system was necessary at the peak of the radiation release event to protect aboveground workers at the site and the public in the surrounding areas. However, evaluation of more than two years of underground ventilation sampling data indicates that residual radioactivity levels in the underground no longer warrant HEPA filtration in order to meet either worker or environmental protection criteria. WIPP should consider resumption of the unfiltered discharge of underground ventilation to the environment. Recent sampling data indicate that there have been no detectable releases that would have resulted in a hypothetical dose to a worker or a member of the public in excess of the 0.1 mSv (10 mrem) per year limit for periodic confirmatory sampling as required for operating repositories by the Environmental Protection Agency (40 CFR 191)","","","","","","United States","2017-07-01T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","Conference","Journal Name: Transactions of the American Nuclear Society; Journal Volume: 116; Conference: 2017 Annual Meeting of the American Nuclear Society, San Francisco, CA (United States), 11-15 Jun 2017; Other Information: Country of input: France; 4 refs.; available from American Nuclear Society - ANS, 555 North Kensington Avenue, La Grange Park, IL 60526 (US)","","Medium: X; Size: page(s) 235-238","","","","Journal ID: ISSN 0003-018X; TRN: US21V2907087776","","","2021-11-01T00:00:00Z","23047391","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/23047391","","Transactions of the American Nuclear Society","","116"

Among these discussed materials, Hastelloy N{sup R} and 316L stainless steel have been selected as the most likely candidate alloys for FHRs. To provide direct experience in integrating a real system using molten FLiBe salt for reactor operation, these two candidate alloys were experimentally tested in Li-7 enriched Li{sub 2}BeF{sub 4} (FLiBe) molten salt in the core of MIT Research Reactor (MITR) at 700 deg. C for 1000 hours. After in-core corrosion testing, some basic post-irradiation examinations (PIE) including weight change per unit area and surface profile as well as surface morphology were conducted in the MIT Nuclear Reactor Laboratory (NRL) and compared with out-of-reactor corrosion samples. The deep understanding of these alloys in high-temperature molten salt with strong neutron irradiation requires further microstructural analysis such as electron microscopy and energy dispersive spectroscopy on the surface and cross-section of the in-core corrosion tested samples. The challenge in the microstructural analysis is due to the high radioactivity from the gamma emitting isotopes formed in alloys during neutron irradiation.

Several restrictions prevent from reaching a very high material recycling efficiency: the variability of the composition of new-marketed materials used for packaging production and its shape and complexity are critical issues. The packaging goods are in fact made of different materials (aluminium, polymers, paper, etc.), possibly assembled, having different shape (flat, cylindrical, one-dimensional, etc.), density, colours, optical properties and so on. These aspects limit the effectiveness and efficiency of the sorting and reprocessing plants. The scope of this study was to evaluate the performance of a large scale Material Recovery Facility (MRF) by utilizing data collected during a long period of monitoring. The database resulted from the measured data has been organized in four sections: (1) data related to the amount and type of inlet waste; (2) amount and composition of output products and waste; (3) operating data (such as worked hours for shift, planned and unscheduled maintenance time, setting parameters of the equipment, and energy consumption for shift); (4) economic data (value of each product, disposal price for the produced waste, penalty for non-compliance of products and waste, etc.). A part of this database has been utilized to build an executive dashboard composed by a set of performance indicators suitable to measure the effectiveness and the efficiency of the MRF operations. The dashboard revealed itself as a powerful tool to support managers and engineers in their decisions in respect to the market demand or compliance regulation variation as well as in the designing of the lay-out improvements. The results indicated that the 40% of the input waste was recovered as valuable products and that a large part of these (88%) complied with the standards of the recycling companies. The evaluation of the indicators led to the decision to modify the layout to improve the interception of some polymers for which the performance indicators were poor. In particular, two additional optical sorters have to be inserted to increase the yield indicator and to the overall performance of the facility. Definitely, the results of the work allowed to: increase the yield and purity of products’ flows; ensure the compliance of waste flows; increase the workability.","","Available from http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.wasman.2017.02.030","","","","United States","2017-06-15T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: Waste Management; Journal Volume: 64; Other Information: Copyright (c) 2017 Elsevier Science B.V., Amsterdam, The Netherlands, All rights reserved.; Country of input: International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA)","","Medium: X; Size: page(s) 3-11","","","","Journal ID: ISSN 0956-053X; CODEN: WAMAE2; PII: S0956-053X(17)30108-3; TRN: US17R4328093027","10.1016/J.WASMAN.2017.02.030","","2019-03-08T00:00:00Z","22742083","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/22742083","","Waste Management","","64"

Urban wastes like biosolids are loaded with essential plant nutrients. In this view, agricultural use of biosolids would enable recycling of these nutrients and could be a sustainable approach towards management of this hugely generated waste. Therefore biosolids i.e. sewage sludge can serve as an important resource for agricultural utilization. Biosolids are characterized by the occurrence of beneficial plant nutrients (essential elements and micro and macronutrients) which can make help them to work as an effective soil amendment, thereby minimizing the reliance on chemical fertilizers. However, biosolids might contain toxic heavy metals that may limit its usage in the cropland. Heavy metals at higher concentration than the permissible limits may lead to food chain contamination and have fatal consequences. Biosolids amendment in soil can improve physical and nutrient property of soil depending on the quantity and portion of the mixture. Hence, biosolids can be a promising soil ameliorating supplement to increase plant productivity, reduce bioavailability of heavy metals and also lead to effective waste management.","","Available from http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.wasman.2017.03.002","","","","United States","2017-06-15T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: Waste Management; Journal Volume: 64; Other Information: Copyright (c) 2017 Elsevier Science B.V., Amsterdam, The Netherlands, All rights reserved.; Country of input: International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA)","","Medium: X; Size: page(s) 117-132","","","","Journal ID: ISSN 0956-053X; CODEN: WAMAE2; PII: S0956-053X(17)30112-5; TRN: US17R4331093029","10.1016/J.WASMAN.2017.03.002","","2019-03-08T00:00:00Z","22742085","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/22742085","","Waste Management","","64"

While biosolids containing alum had negligible amounts of plant-available P, after pyrolysis >90% of the P became immediately available for plant growth. When biosolids with no alum were converted into biochar there was a small increase in the availability of P but a larger pool was available after oxidation. Both of the biosolids leached significant amounts of metals after oxidation. In contrast, the biochars had a very low available metal content and this did not increase with oxidation, demonstrating a stable metal content. Pyrolysis is an effective waste management strategy for biosolids that can simultaneously reduce the leaching of metals and increase the efficiency of recycling of P for beneficial re-use.","","Available from http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.wasman.2017.03.012","","","","United States","2017-06-15T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: Waste Management; Journal Volume: 64; Other Information: Copyright (c) 2017 Elsevier Science B.V., Amsterdam, The Netherlands, All rights reserved.; Country of input: International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA)","","Medium: X; Size: page(s) 133-139","","","","Journal ID: ISSN 0956-053X; CODEN: WAMAE2; PII: S0956-053X(17)30122-8; TRN: US17R4332093030","10.1016/J.WASMAN.2017.03.012","","2019-03-08T00:00:00Z","22742086","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/22742086","","Waste Management","","64"

Corona electrostatic separation has been widely used to recycle metals from waste printed circuit boards, but it has poor separation efficiency for finer sized fractions. In this study, a new process of vibrated gas-solid fluidized bed was used to recycle residual metals from nonmetallic fractions, which were treated using the corona electrostatic separation technology. The effects of three main parameters, i.e., vibration frequency, superficial air flow velocity, and fluidizing time on gravity segregation, were investigated using a vibrating gas-solid fluidized bed. Each size fraction had its own optimum parameters. Corresponding to their optimal segregation performance, the products from each experiment were analyzed using an X-ray fluorescence (XRF) and a scanning electron microscope (SEM) equipped with an energy dispersive spectrometer (EDS). From the results, it can be seen that the metal recoveries of −1 + 0.5 mm, −0.5 + 0.25 mm, and −0.25 mm size fractions were 86.39%, 82.22% and 76.63%, respectively. After separation, each metal content in the −1 + 0.5 or −0.5 + 0.25 mm size fraction reduced to 1% or less, while the Fe and Cu contents are up to 2.57% and 1.50%, respectively, in the −0.25 mm size fraction. Images of the nonmetallic fractions with a size of −0.25 mm indicated that a considerable amount of clavate glass fibers existed in these nonmetallic fractions, which may explain why fine particles had the poorest segregation performance.","","Available from http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.wasman.2017.03.030","","","","United States","2017-06-15T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: Waste Management; Journal Volume: 64; Other Information: Copyright (c) 2017 Elsevier Science B.V., Amsterdam, The Netherlands, All rights reserved.; Country of input: International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA)","","Medium: X; Size: page(s) 228-235","","","","Journal ID: ISSN 0956-053X; CODEN: WAMAE2; PII: S0956-053X(17)30178-2; TRN: US17R4338093035","10.1016/J.WASMAN.2017.03.030","","2019-03-08T00:00:00Z","22742091","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/22742091","","Waste Management","","64"

Despite the necessity of safe treatment, recycling indium is also a focus of waste LCD treatment because of the scarcity of indium. Based on the analyses of the structure of Indium Tin Oxide (ITO) glass, crushing is demonstrated to be not required. In the present research, a complete non-crushing leaching method was firstly adopted to recycle indium from waste LCDs, and the ultrasonic waves was applied in the leaching process. The results demonstrated that indium can be leached efficiently with even a low concentration of chloride acid (HCl) without extra heating. About 96.80% can be recovered in 60 mins, when the ITO glass was leached by 0.8 M HCl with an enhancement of 300 W ultrasonic waves. The indium leaching process is abridged free from crushing, and proves to be of higher efficiency.

In this investigation, response surface methodology (RSM) was utilized to optimize leaching parameters including solid to liquid ratio (S/L), temperature, acid concentration, type of organic acid and hydrogen peroxide concentration. Based on the results obtained from optimizing procedure, temperature was recognized as the most influential parameter. In addition, while 81% of cobalt was recovered, the maximum lithium recovery of 92% was achieved at the optimum leaching condition of 60 °C, S/L: 30 g L{sup −1}, citric acid concentration: 2 M, hydrogen peroxide concentration: 1.25 Vol.% and leaching time: 2 h. Furthermore, results displayed that ultrasonic agitation will enhance the recovery of lithium and cobalt. It was found that the kinetics of cobalt leaching is controlled by surface chemical reaction at temperatures lower than 45 °C. However, diffusion through the product layer at temperatures higher than 45 °C controls the rate of cobalt leaching. Rate of lithium reaction is controlled by diffusion through the product layer at all the temperatures studied.","","Available from http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.wasman.2017.03.037","","","","United States","2017-06-15T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: Waste Management; Journal Volume: 64; Other Information: Copyright (c) 2017 Elsevier Science B.V., Amsterdam, The Netherlands, All rights reserved.; Country of input: International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA)","","Medium: X; Size: page(s) 244-254","","","","Journal ID: ISSN 0956-053X; CODEN: WAMAE2; PII: S0956-053X(17)30184-8; TRN: US17R4340093037","10.1016/J.WASMAN.2017.03.037","","2019-03-08T00:00:00Z","22742093","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/22742093","","Waste Management","","64"

Results of elemental and phase analyses show that indium and tin contents were enriched greatly in indium tin oxide concentrate obtained from colour filter and thin-film transistor glass. The results of crushing, ash content and scanning electron microscopic analyses show that when the LCD panel was crushed into particles smaller than 0.25 mm, the polarizer film is nearly completely liberated from the glass. Moreover, the results of vibrated gas–solid fluidized bed separation show that gas velocity and separation time are the main factors influencing the separation. The vibration intensity of 6.8, gas velocity of 13.6 cm/s and fluidizing time of 30 s are the optimum operating parameters, and the degree of separation and recovery of polarizing film reached up to 37.69 and 72.3%, respectively.

The ASR light fraction, or car fluff, that was collected at an Italian shredding plant was pyrolysed at various temperatures (500–800 °C) in a lab-scale reactor. The condensable gases (tar) and solid residue yields increased with decreasing temperature, and these products were characterized to suggest a potential use to reclaim them. The higher heating value (HHV) of tar was 34–37 MJ/kg, which is comparable with those of fossil fuels. Furthermore, the ash content was low (0.06–4.98%). Thus, tar can be used as an alternative fuel. With this prospect, the concentrations of polychlorinated dibenzodioxins (PCDDs) and polychlorinated dibenzofurans (PCDFs) in tar were determined. The toxicity of tar changes with temperature (1–5 ng I-TEQ/g), and the PCDFs significantly contribute to tar toxicity, which was 75–100% with a maximum of 99.6% at 700 °C. Regarding the characterization of the solid residue, the low HHV (2.4–3.3 MJ/kg) does not make it suitable for energy recovery. Regarding material recovery, we considered its use as a filler in construction materials or a secondary source for metals. It shows a high metal concentration (280,000–395,000 mg/kg), which is similar at different pyrolysis temperatures. At 500 °C, polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) were not detected in the solid residue, whereas the maximum total PAH concentration (19.41 ng/g, 700 °C) was lower than that in fly ash from MSWI. In conclusion, 500 °C is a suitable pyrolysis temperature to obtain valuable tar and solid residue.","","Available from http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.wasman.2017.03.013","","","","United States","2017-06-15T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: Waste Management; Journal Volume: 64; Other Information: Copyright (c) 2017 Elsevier Science B.V., Amsterdam, The Netherlands, All rights reserved.; Country of input: International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA)","","Medium: X; Size: page(s) 263-271","","","","Journal ID: ISSN 0956-053X; CODEN: WAMAE2; PII: S0956-053X(17)30123-X; TRN: US17R4342093039","10.1016/J.WASMAN.2017.03.013","","2019-03-08T00:00:00Z","22742095","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/22742095","","Waste Management","","64"
"Optimal management program for asbestos containing building materials to be available in the event of a disaster","Kim, Young-Chan; Hong, Won-Hwa","54 ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCES; 12 MANAGEMENT OF RADIOACTIVE WASTES, AND NON-RADIOACTIVE WASTES FROM NUCLEAR FACILITIES; ASBESTOS; BUILDING MATERIALS; GREENHOUSE GASES; WASTE MANAGEMENT","Highlights: • The safe management of asbestos is a matter of considerable importance. • There is a lack of literature concerning the development of a program for ACBMs. •A management program for the optimal disposal of ACBMs has been developed. • This program is also available in the event of a post-disaster. - Abstract: The safe management and disposal of asbestos is a matter of considerable importance. A large number of studies have been undertaken to quantify the issue of waste management following a disaster. Nevertheless, there have been few (if any) studies concerning asbestos waste, covering the amount generated, the cost of disposal, and the degree of hazard incurred. Thus, the current study focuses on developing a program for the management of Asbestos Containing Building Materials (ACBMs), which form the source of asbestos waste in the event of a disaster. The study will also discuss a case study undertaken in a specific region in Korea in terms of: (1) the location of ACBM-containing buildings; (2) types and quantities of ACBMs; (3) the cost of ACBM disposal; (4) the amount of asbestos fiber present during normal times and during post-disaster periods; (5) the required order in which ACBM-containing buildings should be dismantled; and (6) additional greenhouse gases generated during ACBM removal. The case study will focus on a specific building, with an area of 35.34 m{sup 2}, and will analyze information concerning the abovementioned points. In addition, the case study will focus on a selected area (108 buildings) and the administrative district (21,063 buildings). The significance of the program can be established by the fact that it visibly transmits information concerning ACBM management. It is a highly promising program, with a widespread application for the safe management and optimal disposal of asbestos in terms of technology, policy, and methodology.","","Available from http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.wasman.2017.03.042","","","","United States","2017-06-15T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: Waste Management; Journal Volume: 64; Other Information: Copyright (c) 2017 Elsevier Science B.V., Amsterdam, The Netherlands, All rights reserved.; Country of input: International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA)","","Medium: X; Size: page(s) 272-285","","","","Journal ID: ISSN 0956-053X; CODEN: WAMAE2; PII: S0956-053X(17)30189-7; TRN: US17R4343093040","10.1016/J.WASMAN.2017.03.042","","2019-03-08T00:00:00Z","22742096","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/22742096","","Waste Management","","64"

"Global reverse supply chain design for solid waste recycling under uncertainties and carbon emission constraint","Xu, Zhitao; Elomri, Adel; Pokharel, Shaligram; Zhang, Qin; Ming, X. G.; Liu, Wenjie","12 MANAGEMENT OF RADIOACTIVE WASTES, AND NON-RADIOACTIVE WASTES FROM NUCLEAR FACILITIES; CARBON; ELECTRONIC WASTES; EMISSION; ENVIRONMENTAL PROTECTION; GLOBAL ASPECTS; RECYCLING; RESOURCE CONSERVATION; SOLID WASTES","Highlights: • We propose a robust model for global reverse supply chain design. • The uncertain waste collection rate, currency exchange rate, and the maritime cost are incorporated. • The total emission and cost are affected by both the uncertainties and the global carbon cap. • The waste products flows between countries vary with the levels of uncertainties and the global carbon cap. • There is an opportunity to reduce the maritime emission. - Abstract: The emergence of concerns over environmental protection, resource conservation as well as the development of logistics operations and manufacturing technology has led several countries to implement formal collection and recycling systems of solid waste. Such recycling system has the benefits of reducing environmental pollution, boosting the economy by creating new jobs, and generating income from trading the recyclable materials. This leads to the formation of a global reverse supply chain (GRSC) of solid waste. In this paper, we investigate the design of such a GRSC with a special emphasis on three aspects; (1) uncertainty of waste collection levels, (2) associated carbon emissions, and (3) challenges posed by the supply chain’s global aspect, particularly the maritime transportation costs and currency exchange rates. To the best of our knowledge, this paper is the first attempt to integrate the three above-mentioned important aspects in the design of a GRSC. We have used mixed integer-linear programming method along with robust optimization to develop the model which is validated using a sample case study of e-waste management. Our results show that using a robust model by taking the complex interactions characterizing global reverse supply chain networks into account, we can create a better GRSC. The effect of uncertainties and carbon constraints on decisions to reduce costs and emissions are also shown.","","Available from http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.wasman.2017.02.024","","","","United States","2017-06-15T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: Waste Management; Journal Volume: 64; Other Information: Copyright (c) 2017 Elsevier Science B.V., Amsterdam, The Netherlands, All rights reserved.; Country of input: International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA)","","Medium: X; Size: page(s) 358-370","","","","Journal ID: ISSN 0956-053X; CODEN: WAMAE2; PII: S0956-053X(17)30102-2; TRN: US17R4346093043","10.1016/J.WASMAN.2017.02.024","","2019-03-08T00:00:00Z","22742099","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/22742099","","Waste Management","","64"

Fayol, 158 cours Fauriel, Saint-Etienne F42023 (France)]; Villot, Jonathan; Glaus, Mathias; Laforest, Valérie; Hausler, Robert","12 MANAGEMENT OF RADIOACTIVE WASTES, AND NON-RADIOACTIVE WASTES FROM NUCLEAR FACILITIES; ANAEROBIC DIGESTION; COMPOSTING; PLANNING; SOLID WASTES","Highlights: • A model to evaluate the service area size of a waste recovery chain is proposed. • A recovery performance score is given per waste source. •The areas to be collected in priority are the sources with the highest score. • The score depends on the source's characteristics and the recovery technology. •Replacing anaerobic digestion by composting decreases the facility's spatial scale. - Abstract: Waste recovery is an integrated part of municipal solid waste management systems but its strategic planning is still challenging. In particular, the service area size of facilities is a sensitive issue since its calculation depends on various factors related to treatment technologies (output products) and territorial features (sources waste production and location). This work presents a systemic approach for the estimation of a chain's service area size, based on a balance between costs and recovery profits. The model assigns a recovery performance value to each source, which can be positive, neutral or negative. If it is positive, the source should be included in the facility's service area. Applied to the case of Montreal for food waste recovery by anaerobic digestion, the approach showed that at most 23 out of the 30 districts should be included in the service area, depending on the indicator, which represents around 127,000 t of waste recovered/year. Due to the systemic approach, these districts were not necessarily the closest to the facility. Moreover, for the Montreal case, changing the facility's location did not have a great influence on the optimal service area size, showing that the distance to the facility was not a decisive factor at this scale. However, replacing anaerobic digestion by a composting plant reduced the break-even transport distances and, thus, the number of sources worth collecting (around 68,500 t/year). In this way, the methodology, applied to different management strategies, gave a sense of the spatial dynamics involved in the recovery chain's design. The map of optimal supply obtained could be used to further analyse the feasibility of multi-site and/or multi-technology systems for the territory considered.","","Available from http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.wasman.2017.03.027","","","","United States","2017-06-15T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: Waste Management; Journal Volume: 64; Other Information: Copyright (c) 2017 Elsevier Science B.V., Amsterdam, The Netherlands, All rights reserved.; Country of input: International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA)","","Medium: X; Size: page(s) 386-396","","","","Journal ID: ISSN 0956-053X; CODEN: WAMAE2; PII: S0956-053X(17)30173-3; TRN: US17R4347093044","10.1016/J.WASMAN.2017.03.027","","2019-03-08T00:00:00Z","22742100","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/22742100","","Waste Management","","64"

The lab-scale CSTR was operated at 38 °C and HRT{sub CM} was reduced from 52 days to 5 days. At HRT{sub CM} of 20–45 days, the reactor was relatively stable in terms of the volumetric biogas production rates and specific biogas production (SBP), which were 2.2–2.4 L/L/d and 338.3–418.7 mL/gVS{sub added}, respectively. However, process instability and VFA accumulation occurred when the HRT{sub CM} was reduced to 10 days due to excess microbes washout. The reduction in HRT{sub CM} to 5 days caused SBP to decrease to 198.7 mL/gVS{sub added} and the acetic acid content to exceed 6000 mg/L. The biomass balance model showed that the biomass concentration at HRT{sub CM} of 20–52 days (0.473–0.615 gVSS/L) was notably higher than that at HRT{sub CM} of 5–10 days (0.173 gVSS/L).","","Available from http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.wasman.2017.03.034","","","","United States","2017-06-15T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: Waste Management; Journal Volume: 64; Other Information: Copyright (c) 2017 Elsevier Science B.V., Amsterdam, The Netherlands, All rights reserved.; Country of input: International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA)","","Medium: X; Size: page(s) 340-347","","","","Journal ID: ISSN 0956-053X; CODEN: WAMAE2; PII: S0956-053X(17)30182-4; TRN: US17R4344093041","10.1016/J.WASMAN.2017.03.034","","2019-03-08T00:00:00Z","22742097","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/22742097","","Waste Management","","64"

Depletion was assessed at four temperatures (25, 50, 70, and 90°C). Comparative tests were conducted with nonradioactive synthetic leachate (NSL) having the same chemistry as RSL, except radionuclides were excluded. Control tests were conducted with deionized (DI) water. One-sided exposure tests were also conducted with the HDPE GM in RSL at 70 and 90°C. Specimens were removed periodically and tested to determine antioxidant depletion, melt flow index (MFI), crystallinity, and stress crack resistance. Standard and high-pressure oxidative induction time (OIT) tests were conducted to measure antioxidant depletion. Antioxidant depletion rates in RSL were only slightly greater than those in NSL, indicating that radionuclides in the LLW leachate had only minor effect on antioxidant depletion. Antioxidant depletion in RSL and NSL occurred 1.1–1.9 times faster than in DI water. Antioxidant depletion in HDPE GMs exposed to RSL and NSL at 90°C was complete after 12 months. MFI decreased systematically after 15 months of immersion, which is indicative of crosslinking due to oxidation. Crystallinity also decreased slightly after 12 months, whereas stress crack resistance (SCR) showed no trend over the immersion period. Arrhenius modeling was used to extrapolate the laboratory data at elevated temperatures to a typical LLWliner at 15°C. Predicted time for antioxidant depletion for a 2-mm-thick HDPE GM in a composite liner in contact with LLW leachate is estimated to be 730 years. The total service life of HDPE GMs in contact with LLWleachate is estimated to be at least 1975 years.","American Society of Civil Engineers","","Vanderbilt Univ., Nashville, TN (United States)","USDOE","","United States","2017-06-01T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: Journal of Geotechnical and Geoenvironmental Engineering; Journal Volume: 143; Journal Issue: 6","","Medium: ED; Size: Article No. 04017011","","","FC01-06EW07053","Journal ID: ISSN 1090-0241; TRN: US1802212","10.1061/(ASCE)GT.1943-5606.0001643","","2018-09-13T00:00:00Z","1425968","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/1425968","https://www.osti.gov/servlets/purl/1425968","Journal of Geotechnical and Geoenvironmental Engineering","6","143"

In this study, we synthesized U loaded garnet phases, Ca<sub>3</sub>U<sub>x</sub>Zr<sub>2–x</sub>Fe<sub>3</sub>O<sub>12</sub> (x = 0.5–0.7), along with the endmember phase, Ca<sub>3</sub>(Zr<sub>2</sub>)SiFe<sup>3+</sup><sub>2</sub>O<sub>12</sub>, for comparison. The oxidation states of U were determined by X-ray photoelectron and absorption spectroscopies, revealing the presence of mixed pentavalent and hexavalent uranium in the phases with x = 0.6 and 0.7. The oxidation states and coordination environments of Fe were measured using transmission <sup>57</sup>Fe-Mössbauer spectroscopy, which shows that all iron is tetrahedrally coordinated Fe<sup>3+</sup>. U substitution had a significant effect on local environments, the extent of U substitution within this range had a minimal effect on the structure, and unlike in the x = 0 sample, Fe exists in two different environments in the substituted garnets. The enthalpies of formation of garnet phases from constituent oxides and elements were first time determined by high temperature oxide melt solution calorimetry. The results indicate that these substituted garnets are thermodynamically stable under reducing conditions. Furthermore, our structural and thermodynamic analysis further provides explanation for the formation of natural uranium garnet, elbrusite-(Zr), and supports the potential use of Ca<sub>3</sub>U<sub>x</sub>Zr<sub>2–x</sub>Fe<sub>3</sub>O<sub>12</sub> as viable waste form phases for U and other actinides.","The Geochemical Society; The Meteoritical Society","","Los Alamos National Lab.

A novel approach for integrating social acceptance in a permit decision-making process for subsurface activities","Os, Herman W.A. van, E-mail: h.w.a.van.os@rug.nl; Herber, Rien; Scholtens, Bert","12 MANAGEMENT OF RADIOACTIVE WASTES, AND NON-RADIOACTIVE WASTES FROM NUCLEAR FACILITIES; 54 ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCES; COMPRESSED AIR ENERGY STORAGE; DECISION MAKING; ENERGY POLICY; ENVIRONMENTAL IMPACT STATEMENTS; ENVIRONMENTAL IMPACTS; HYDROGEN STORAGE; LICENSE APPLICATIONS; LICENSES; NATURAL GAS; RADIOACTIVE WASTES; SENSITIVITY ANALYSIS; STORAGE FACILITIES; UNDERGROUND","We investigate how the decision support system ‘Modular Evaluation Method Subsurface Activities’ (MEMSA) can help facilitate an informed decision-making process for permit applications of subsurface activities. To this end, we analyze the extent the MEMSA approach allows for a dialogue between stakeholders in a transparent manner. We use the exploration permit for the underground gas storage facility at the Pieterburen salt dome (Netherlands) as a case study. The results suggest that the MEMSA approach is flexible enough to adjust to changing conditions. Furthermore, MEMSA provides a novel way for identifying structural problems and possible solutions in permit decision-making processes for subsurface activities, on the basis of the sensitivity analysis of intermediate rankings. We suggest that the planned size of an activity should already be specified in the exploration phase, because this would allow for a more efficient use of the subsurface as a whole. We conclude that the host community should be involved to a greater extent and in an early phase of the permit decision-making process, for example, already during the initial analysis of the project area of a subsurface activity. We suggest that strategic national policy goals are to be re-evaluated on a regular basis, in the form of a strategic vision for the subsurface, to account for timing discrepancies between the realization of activities and policy deadlines, because this discrepancy can have a large impact on the necessity and therefore acceptance of a subsurface activity.","","Available from http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.eiar.2017.03.004","","","","United States","2017-05-15T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: Environmental Impact Assessment Review; Journal Volume: 64; Other Information: Copyright (c) 2017 Elsevier Science B.V., Amsterdam, The Netherlands, All rights reserved.; Country of input: International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA)","","Medium: X; Size: page(s) 97-122","","","","Journal ID: ISSN 0195-9255; CODEN: EIARDK; PII: S0195-9255(16)30357-2; TRN: US17R2090037016","10.1016/J.EIAR.2017.03.004","","2018-05-18T00:00:00Z","22688007","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/22688007","","Environmental Impact Assessment Review","","64"
"Implications of Grain-Scale Mineralogical Heterogeneity for Radionuclide Transport in Fractured Media","Trinchero, Paolo; Molinero, Jorge; Deissmann, Guido; Svensson, Urban; Gylling, Björn; Ebrahimi, Hedieh; Hammond, Glenn; Bosbach, Dirk; Puigdomenech, Ignasi","12 MANAGEMENT OF RADIOACTIVE AND NON-RADIOACTIVE WASTES FROM NUCLEAR FACILITIES; 97 MATHEMATICS AND COMPUTING; grain-scale mineralogical heterogeneity; radionuclide transport; microcontinuum model; high-performance computing (HPC)","The geological disposal of nuclear waste is based on the multi-barrier concept, comprising various engineered and natural barriers, to confine the radioactive waste and isolate it from the biosphere. Some of the planned repositories for high-level nuclear waste will be hosted in fractured crystalline rock formations. The potential of these formations to act as natural transport barriers is related to two coupled processes: diffusion into the rock matrix and sorption onto the mineral surfaces available in the rock matrix. Different in situ and laboratory experiments have pointed out the ubiquitous heterogeneous nature of the rock matrix: mineral surfaces and pore space are distributed in complex microstructures and their distribution is far from being homogeneous (as typically assumed by Darcy-scale coarse reactive transport models). We use a synthetically generated fracture–matrix system to assess the implications of grain-scale physical and mineralogical heterogeneity on cesium transport and retention. The resulting grain-scale reactive transport model is solved using high-performance computing technologies, and the results are compared with those derived from two alternative models, denoted as upscaled models, where mineral abundance is averaged over the matrix volume. In the grain-scale model, the penetration of cesium into the matrix is faster and the penetration front is uneven and finger-shaped. The analysis of the cesium breakthrough curves computed at two different points in the fracture shows that the upscaled models provide later first-arrival time estimates compared to the grain-scale model. The breakthrough curves computed with the three models converge at late times. These results suggest that spatially averaged upscaled parameters of sorption site distribution can be used to predict the late-time behavior of breakthrough curves but could be inadequate to simulate the early behavior.","Springer","","Sandia National Lab.

"X-ray absorption and Raman spectroscopy studies of molybdenum environments in borosilicate waste glasses","McKeown, David A.; Gan, Hao; Pegg, Ian L.","12 MANAGEMENT OF RADIOACTIVE AND NON-RADIOACTIVE WASTES FROM NUCLEAR FACILITIES","Mo-containing high-level nuclear waste borosilicate glasses were investigated as part of an effort to improve Mo loading while avoiding yellow phase crystallization. Previous work showed that additions of vanadium decrease yellow phase formation and increases Mo solubility. X-ray absorption spectroscopy (XAS) and Raman spectroscopy were used to characterize Mo environments in HLW borosilicate glasses and to investigate possible structural relationships between Mo and V. Mo XAS spectra for the glasses indicate isolated tetrahedral Mo6+O4 with Mo-O distances near 1.75 Å. V XANES indicate tetrahedral V5+O4 as the dominant species. Raman spectra show composition dependent trends, where Mo-O symmetrical stretch mode frequencies (ν1) are sensitive to the mix of alkali and alkaline earth cations, decreasing by up to 10 cm-1 for glasses that change from Li+ to Na+ as the dominant network-modifying species. This indicates that MoO4 tetrahedra are isolated from the borosilicate network and are surrounded, at least partly, by Na+ and Li+. Secondary ν1 frequency effects, with changes up to 7 cm-1, were also observed with increasing V2O5 and MoO3 content. These secondary trends may indicate MoO4-MoO4 and MoO4-VO4 clustering, suggesting that V additions may stabilize Mo in the matrix with respect to yellow phase formation.","Elsevier","","Brookhaven National Lab.

Using X-ray diffraction measurements, we show that trevorite is no longer detectable after irradiation and thermal quenching. When a crystal-free analog of the same waste glass simulant composition was exposed to the same microwave radiation, it could not be heated above 450°C regardless of the heating time. The reduction in crystalline content achieved by selectively heating spinels in the presence of glass suggests that microwave-specific heating should be further explored as a technique for remediating crystal accumulation in a glass melt.","American Ceramic Society","available","Savannah River Site (SRS), Aiken, SC (United States)","USDOE","","United States","2016-08-03T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: International Journal of Applied Glass Science; Journal Volume: 8; Journal Issue: 2","","Medium: ED; Size: p. 158-164","","SRNL-STI-2016-00364","AC09-08SR22470; DE‐AC09‐08SR22470","Journal ID: ISSN 2041-1286","10.1111/ijag.12222","","2017-08-07T00:00:00Z","1352521","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/1352521","https://www.osti.gov/servlets/purl/1352521","International Journal of Applied Glass Science","2","8"
"Using polymerization, glass structure, and quasicrystalline theory to produce high level radioactive borosilicate glass remotely: a 20+ year legacy","Jantzen, Carol M.","12 MANAGEMENT OF RADIOACTIVE AND NON-RADIOACTIVE WASTES FROM NUCLEAR FACILITIES","Vitrification is currently the most widely used technology for the treatment of high level radioactive wastes (HLW) throughout the world. Most of the nations that have generated HLW are immobilizing in borosilicate glass. One of the primary reasons that glass has become the most widely used immobilization media is the relative simplicity of the vitrification process, e.g. melt a highly variable waste with some glass forming additives such as SiO<sub>2</sub> and B<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub> in the form of a premelted frit and pour the molten mixture into a stainless steel canister. Seal the canister before moisture can enter the canister (10’ tall by 2’ in diameter) so the canister does not corrode from the inside out. Glass has also become widely used for HLW is that due to the fact that the short range order (SRO) and medium range order (MRO) found in the structure of glass atomistically bonds the radionuclides and hazardous species in the waste. The SRO and MRO have also been found to govern the melt properties such as viscosity and resistivity of the melt and the crystallization potential and solubility of certain species. Furthermore, the molecular structure of the glass also controls the glass durability, i.e. the contaminant/radionuclide release, by establishing the distribution of ion exchange sites, hydrolysis sites, and the access of water to those sites. The molecular structure is flexible and hence accounts for the flexibility of glass formulations to HLW waste variability. Nuclear waste glasses melt between 1050-1150°C which minimizes the volatility of radioactive components such as <sup>99</sup>Tc, <sup>137</sup>Cs, and <sup>129</sup>I. Nuclear waste glasses have good long term stability including irradiation resistance. Process control models were developed based on the molecular structure of glass, polymerization theory of glass, and quasicrystalline theory of glass crystallization. These models create a glass which is durable, pourable, and processable with 95% accuracy without knowing from batch to batch what the composition of the waste coming out of the storage tanks will be. These models have operated the Savannah River Site Defense Waste Processing Facility (SRS DWPF), which is the world’s largest HLW Joule heated ceramic melter, since 1996. This unique “feed forward” process control, which qualifies the durability, pourability, and processability of the waste plus glass additive mixture before it enters the melter, has enabled ~8000 tons of HLW glass and 4242 canisters to be produced since 1996 with only one melter replacement.","South Carolina Academy of Science","","Savannah River Site (SRS), Aiken, SC (United States)","USDOE","","United States","2017-03-27T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: Journal of the South Carolina Academy of Science; Journal Volume: 15; Journal Issue: 1","","Medium: ED; Size: Article No. 4","","SRNL-STI-2017-00199","AC09-08SR22470; AC09-96SR18500; AC09-89SR18035","Journal ID: ISSN 1553-5975","","","2017-11-14T00:00:00Z","1407942","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/1407942","https://www.osti.gov/servlets/purl/1407942","Journal of the South Carolina Academy of Science","1","15"

Tc(IV) incorporation in spinels has been proposed as a novel method to increase Tc retention in glass waste forms during vitrification. However, experiments under high-temperature and oxic conditions show reoxidation of Tc(IV) to volatile pertechnetate, Tc(VII).

We report that one of the more common methods for Tc removal from solution and immobilization in solids is based on reducing Tc from highly soluble Tc<sup>(VII)</sup> to sparingly soluble Tc<sup>(IV)</sup>. Here, we report results obtained with two potassium metal sulfides (KMS-2 and KMS-2-SS) that are capable of reducing Tc<sup>(VII)</sup> to Tc<sup>(IV)</sup>. Batch sorption experiments were performed in both oxic and anoxic conditions for 15 d in both deionized water (DIW) and a highly caustic (pH ~ 13.6), high ionic strength (8.0 mol L<sup>-1</sup>), low-activity waste (LAW) stream simulant solution. Tc removal for both materials in DIW is improved in anoxic conditions compared to oxic conditions as a result of a higher solution pH. In DIW and anoxic conditions, KMS-2 is capable of removing ~45% of Tc, and KMS-2-SS is capable of removing ~90% of Tc. Both materials perform even better in the LAW simulant and remove more than 90% of available Tc after 15 d of contact in anoxic conditions. Postreaction solids analyses indicate that Tc<sup>(VII)</sup> is reduced to Tc<sup>(IV)</sup> and that Tc(IV)is bonded to S atoms in a Tc<sub>2</sub>S<sub>7</sub> complex. Examination of the materials after Tc removal by X-ray diffraction shows that the initially crystalline KMS-2 materials lose much of their initial long-range order.

Value elements in electronic waste include gold, palladium, silver, copper, nickel, and rare earth elements (RE). Here, we present the development of a process that enables efficient recycling of metals from scrap mobile electronics. An electro recycling (ER) process, based on the regeneration of Fe<sup>3+</sup> as a weak oxidizer, is studied for the selective recovery of base metals while leaving precious metals for separate extraction at reduced chemical demand. A separate process recovers rare earth oxides from magnets in electronics. Furthermore, recovery and extraction efficiencies ca. 90 % were obtained for the extraction of base metals from the non-ferromagnetic fraction in the two different solution matrices tested (H<sub>2</sub>SO<sub>4</sub>, and HCl). The effect of the pre-extraction of base metals in the increase of precious metals extraction efficiency was verified. On the other hand, the extraction of rare earths from the ferromagnetic fraction, performed by means of anaerobic extraction in acid media, was assessed for the selective recovery of rare earths. We developed a comprehensive flow sheet to process electronic waste to value products.","Elsevier","","Idaho National Lab.

"Submixture model to predict nepheline precipitation in waste glasses","Vienna, John D.; Kroll, Jared O.; Hrma, Pavel R.; Lang, Jesse B.; Crum, Jarrod V.","12 MANAGEMENT OF RADIOACTIVE AND NON-RADIOACTIVE WASTES FROM NUCLEAR FACILITIES; Glass; Nuclear Waste; Nepheline; Crystallization; Canister Centerline Cooling","High-alumina high-level waste (HLW) glasses are prone to nepheline (nominally NaAlSiO4) precipitation during canister-centerline cooling (CCC). If sufficient nepheline forms the chemical durability of the glass will be significantly impacted. Overly conservative constraints have been developed and used to avoid the deleterious effects of nepheline formation in U.S. HLW vitrification plants. The constraint used has been shown to significantly limit the loading of waste in glass at Hanford and therefore the cost and schedule of cleanup. A study was performed to develop an improved understanding of the impacts of glass composition on the formation of nepheline during CCC. Four experimental phases were conducted in which 90 independent glass compositions were fabricated, subjected to simulated CCC heat-treatments, and characterized for crystallinity – 38 of the 90 test glasses formed nepheline. These data were examined separately and combined with 657 glasses previously tested glasses found in literature. The trends showed that in addition to Na2O, Al2O3, and SiO2 components included in previous constraints B2O3, CaO, K2O, and Li2O also significant impacted the propensity for nepheline formation. A pseudo-ternary submixture approach was proposed to identify the glass composition region prone to nepheline precipitation. This pseudo-ternary with axis of SiO2 + 1.70B2O3, Na2O + 0.813Li2O + 0.439K2O + 0.223CaO, and Al2O3 was found to effectively divide typical U.S. HLW glasses that precipitate nepheline during CCC from those that do not. This approach results in a total misclassification rate of 13%, 7% of which are false negatives (those glasses predicted not to form nepheline that actually do for nepheline). When applied to the 90 glasses developed specifically for Hanford high-alumina HLWs, the misclassification rate is 19% (17/90) with 1/38 false negatives. Application of such a constraint is anticipated to increase the loading of Hanford high-alumina HLWs in glass by roughly one third.","American Ceramic Society","","Pacific Northwest National Lab.

Dry storage represented an innovative solution to the problem created by the U.S. government's failure to fulfill its obligation to begin removing SNF from power plant sites. Today, about 70 ISFSIs have been placed into operation on the sites of current, or former nuclear power plants. There are currently over 2,200 SNF dry storage systems (DSSs) in service at these locations. Thirteen of these ISFSIs are located at sites with no operating reactor, and this number is due to increase in the coming years. Operating nuclear power stations use ISFSI storage to maintain wet storage capacity for recently discharged SNF. Permanently shutdown nuclear power plants use ISFSI storage to allow decommissioning and dismantlement of the power plant structures, systems, and components. The U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission (NRC) regulates the licensing, construction, and operation of ISFSIs under Title 10 of the U.S. Code of Federal Regulations, Energy, Part 72, Licensing Requirements for the Independent Storage of Spent Nuclear Fuel, High-Level Radioactive Waste, and Reactor-Related Greater than Class-C Waste (10 CFR 72). When the regulations in 10 CFR 72 were created around 1980, 20 years was chosen by the NRC as the license term for a specific ISFSI license and later, for a DSS Certificate of Compliance (CoC). Twenty years was, at the time, believed to be a sufficient time period for on-site interim dry storage of spent nuclear fuel before the U.S. government began moving the spent fuel away from the plant site for final disposal. Little, if any consideration was given to providing a regulatory framework for extending ISFSI licenses and DSS CoCs beyond 20 years at that time. However, shortly after the turn of the century, with still no federal program for removing SNF from reactor sites on the near-term horizon it became apparent that most DSSs would be required to remain in service at the ISFSIs beyond the initial 20-year license term. Operation beyond the original license term requires the specific license or the DSS CoC (used at a general license ISFSI) to be renewed. The requirements for renewal of a specific ISFSI license or a DSS CoC include addressing age-related degradation of structures, systems, and components that perform or support safety functions.

"Use of a Dual-Structure Constitutive Model for Predicting the Long-Term Behavior of an Expansive Clay Buffer in a Nuclear Waste Repository","Vilarrasa, Víctor; Rutqvist, Jonny; Blanco Martin, Laura; Birkholzer, Jens","12 MANAGEMENT OF RADIOACTIVE AND NON-RADIOACTIVE WASTES FROM NUCLEAR FACILITIES; expansive soil; engineered barrier systems; unsaturated porous media; swelling; thermo-hydro-mechanical coupling","Expansive soils are suitable as backfill and buffer materials in engineered barrier systems to isolate heat-generating nuclear waste in deep geological formations. The canisters containing nuclear waste would be placed in tunnels excavated at a depth of several hundred meters. The expansive soil should provide enough swelling capacity to support the tunnel walls, thereby reducing the impact of the excavation-damaged zone on the long-term mechanical and flow-barrier performance. In addition to their swelling capacity, expansive soils are characterized by accumulating irreversible strain on suction cycles and by effects of microstructural swelling on water permeability that for backfill or buffer materials can significantly delay the time it takes to reach full saturation. In order to simulate these characteristics of expansive soils, a dual-structure constitutive model that includes two porosity levels is necessary. The authors present the formulation of a dual-structure model and describe its implementation into a coupled fluid flow and geomechanical numerical simulator. The authors use the Barcelona Basic Model (BBM), which is an elastoplastic constitutive model for unsaturated soils, to model the macrostructure, and it is assumed that the strains of the microstructure, which are volumetric and elastic, induce plastic strain to the macrostructure. The authors tested and demonstrated the capabilities of the implemented dual-structure model by modeling and reproducing observed behavior in two laboratory tests of expansive clay. As observed in the experiments, the simulations yielded nonreversible strain accumulation with suction cycles and a decreasing swelling capacity with increasing confining stress. Finally, the authors modeled, for the first time using a dual-structure model, the long-term (100,000 years) performance of a generic heat-generating nuclear waste repository with waste emplacement in horizontal tunnels backfilled with expansive clay and hosted in a clay rock formation. The thermo-hydro-mechanical results of the dual-structure model were compared with those of the standard single-structure BBM. The main difference between the simulation results from the two models is that the dual-structure model predicted a time to fully saturate the expansive clay barrier on the order of thousands of years, whereas the standard single-structure BBM yielded a time on the order of tens of years. These examples show that a dual-structure model, such as the one presented here, is necessary to properly model the thermo-hydro-mechanical behavior of expansive soils.","American Society of Civil Engineers","","Lawrence Berkeley National Lab.

Because it is inexpensive and easy to manufacture, cement is the material of choice to store large volumes of radioactive materials, in particular the low-level medium-lived fission products. It is therefore of utmost importance to assess the chemical and structural stability of cement containing radioactive species. Here, we use ab initio calculations based on density functional theory (DFT) to study the effects of <sup>90</sup>Sr insertion and decay in C–S–H (calcium-silicate-hydrate) in order to test the ability of cement to trap and hold this radioactive fission product and to investigate the consequences of its β-decay on the cement paste structure. We show that <sup>90</sup>Sr is stable when it substitutes the Ca<sup>2+</sup> ions in C–S–H, and so is its daughter nucleus <sup>90</sup>Y after β-decay. Interestingly, <sup>90</sup>Zr, daughter of <sup>90</sup>Y and final product in the decay sequence, is found to be unstable compared to the bulk phase of the element at zero K but stable when compared to the solvated ion in water.

Chemical zonation and mineralogical zonation were observed in the surface regions of marine-exposed concrete. Three zones were found irrespective of the age, location or binder composition: a magnesium-rich zone, a sulfur-rich zone, and a chlorine-rich zone. The absence of major damage indicates that the observed phase changes led only to minor scaling. This suggests that, rather than sulfate attack, sea water merely causes sulfur enrichment.","","Available from http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.cemconres.2016.02.006","","","","United States","2016-07-15T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: Cement and Concrete Research; Journal Volume: 85; Other Information: Copyright (c) 2016 Elsevier Science B.V., Amsterdam, The Netherlands, All rights reserved.; Country of input: International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA)","","Medium: X; Size: page(s) 12-27","","","","Journal ID: ISSN 0008-8846; CODEN: CCNRAI; PII: S0008-8846(16)30124-7; TRN: US16R3278046251","10.1016/J.CEMCONRES.2016.02.006","","2018-06-29T00:00:00Z","22696563","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/22696563","","Cement and Concrete Research","","85"

The steam produced in the reactor was used to generate electricity (up to 150 MW) and desalination of seawater (up to 120,000 tons/day). The BN-350 reactor became operational in July 1973; its design operation lifetime was 20 years. After expiration of the reactor design lifetime in July 1993, its subsequent operation was continued according to the annual decisions on extension of the reactor operation, by one year. The reactor has been idle since December 1998. On April 22, 1999 Resolution No. 456 'About decommissioning of the BN-350 reactor in Aktau, Mangistau region' was adopted by the RK Government. Thus, the total operation period of the reactor was more than 25 years. One of the important issues related to the long-term operation of a radiation-hazardous facility, such as the BN-350 reactor, is to assess its impact on the environment. The necessity and urgency of detailed studies of the radiation situation is explained by the location of the Caspian Sea and Aktau city in the area of the BN-350 reactor's potential impact. This paper describes the preliminary results of the evaluation of the BN-350 reactor's effect on the level of radionuclide contamination of surface water, including the Caspian Sea via the mechanism of radionuclide discharge in wastewater.

Spent nuclear fuel presents extra complexity of security and proliferation issues. These fuel assemblies are practically inaccessible for inspection purposes, as reopening a DSC would require special facilities and would be tremendously expensive. Cosmic-ray muon Tomography has been studied in the past for various applications and was demonstrated to be a good non-destructive assay technique for high-Z materials, such as spent nuclear fuel assemblies in dry storage casks (DSC). Compared to conventional imaging techniques, muon imaging has some advantages due to its negligible health risk and high penetrating power. In this paper, we report our simulation study on imaging a DSC using muon Tomography technique. The Point of Closest Approach (POCA) and the Maximum-Likelihood Expectation- Maximization (ML-EM) algorithms are implemented and evaluated. A scaled-down prototype muon tomography system is proposed and studied.

"Computed Tomography of Dry Cask Storage for Used Fuel","Greulich, Christopher; Gao, Yuan; Enqvist, Andreas; Tulenko, James; Baciak, James","46 INSTRUMENTATION RELATED TO NUCLEAR SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY; 12 MANAGEMENT OF RADIOACTIVE WASTES, AND NON-RADIOACTIVE WASTES FROM NUCLEAR FACILITIES; BURNUP; COMPUTERIZED SIMULATION; COMPUTERIZED TOMOGRAPHY; FUEL ASSEMBLIES; FUEL STORAGE POOLS; GAMMA RADIATION; LOADING; NEUTRONS; NUCLEAR FUELS; NUCLEAR POWER PLANTS; RADIATION TRANSPORT; RADON; REACTOR SITES; SPENT FUEL CASKS; SPENT FUEL STORAGE; STEELS; TRANSPORT THEORY; VERIFICATION","The demand for dry cask storage for used nuclear fuel is on the rise due to the continuous operation of currently existing nuclear plants which are reaching or have reached the capacity of their used fuel pools. Dry cask storage allows used fuel that has already been cooled in the used fuel pool for at least five years to be surrounded by an inert gas inside a specially designed and licensed cask. Currently, 75 of the 78 U.S.A reactor sites either have or are pursuing an independent spent fuel storage installation (ISFSI) for dry cask fuel storage with over 2,000 casks already loaded. Cask loading will only continue to increase until a final repository solution is operational or the U.S. begins to recycle fuel. The challenge of monitoring the condition of the used fuel inside the cask without exposing the used fuel has been apparent since the 1980's. The objective of the University of Florida (UF) project is ultimately to investigate the feasibility of imaging the used fuel assemblies' location and evaluating the inner structural condition using emission source computed tomography (CT). A combination of radiation transport models will be used to simulate gamma-rays and neutrons traversing through the used fuel, structure, and cask body materials. In the simulations, multiple linear detector arrays will record the radiation outside the cask wall and will be placed at various angles in order to model rotating a linear detector array around the entire cask. The combination of data from all the detectors will give the planar radiation projection onto the detectors, more commonly called the Radon transform, of the structure of used fuel assemblies. This project can be processed with filtered back projection or other more advanced reconstructive imaging algorithms to recreate the fuel structures. A majority of the historical work done for used fuel has been on verification, diversion detection, and burnup credit validation in order to meet regulatory guidelines. One of the more commonly used systems for single assembly verification is the Fork Detector developed at Los Alamos National Laboratory in 1988. A group at the Idaho National Laboratory developed a Compton Dry-Cask Imaging Scanner that has the ability to detect empty vs full storage positions but it suffered a setback when transported to the Doel Nuclear Power Plant near Antwerp, Belgium; the system was unable to detect full energy peaks because of the additional scattering caused by a thick ballistic steel shield. As detectors, computational power, and modeling improves, a few groups have leveraged these advancements and started to investigate CT hoping, that despite the difficulties, the technique can give information on fuel condition. So far the groups have mostly limited the tomographic work to a per assembly basis , rather than the full dry cask as the University of Florida plans to investigate. The downsides of CT versus simpler verification and validation are the amount of data required and the time it takes to acquire that data. Given that dry casks are intended to sit undistributed for up to 60 years, a scanning time of several weeks to several months is not unreasonable if such systems do not require human operators beyond the initial setup.

The heptoxides of manganese and technetium crystallize as molecular solids while rhenium forms an extended solid with mixed valances, 4 and 6. Unlike manganese and rhenium heptoxides which are used in the chemical industry technetium heptoxide has found very few applications due to its radioactive nature; it has been primarily use as a chemical precursor. While both of the molecular solids, Mn{sub 2}O{sub 7}{sup 3} and Tc{sub 2}O{sub 7}{sup 4} can be described by two corner-sharing MO{sub 4} tetrahedron. The most distinctive difference is that the manganese's compound has a metal-oxygen-metal bond angle of 120.7 deg. while the technetium species is 180 deg.. Additionally, Tc{sub 2}O{sub 7} has the largest molar volume of the heptoxides which suggest that it will be more susceptible to external stimuli of pressure and temperature than the others heptoxides. A pressure induced twisting has been predicted by Fang et al. Anomalous behavior is seen in the c-axis where below 2 GPa the Van der Waals interactions between the Tc{sub 2}O{sub 7} molecules is over come and compression is observed but at higher pressures the twisted distortion forces the lattice to expand. The terminology diagonal-double tetrahedrons (DDTs) is introduced to discuss the molecules of Tc{sub 2}O{sub 7}. The rigid nature of the DDTs has been attributed to the cause of this twisted distortion mechanism. Recently, the solid state and gas phase behavior of technetium heptoxide was revisited by Childs et al. in light of {sup 99}Tc being an important dose contributor in the Hanford waste and vitrification being proposed for immobilization of nuclear waste. Technetium heptoxide is one of the proposed volatilized species of technetium found in the vitrification process. In this study the crystal structure of Tc{sub 2}O{sub 7} was reported at 100 K and compared to the structure first determined by Krebs at room temperature. Inspection of the metal-oxygen distances revealed the 100 K structure had longer bond lengths for the bridging oxygen than at high temperature. It is suggested that transverse thermal vibrational modes can be used to explain this negative thermal expansion behavior. This describes the average bond length of a central atom (i.e. the bridging oxygen atom) being measured as shorter at higher temperatures due to the larger thermal motion. Diffraction methods that measure the long range average structure are susceptible to observing this shorter average length as opposed to the true bond length, atom position at oscillation node that a method like Pair-Distribution Functional PDF Analysis would yield. In the case of Tc{sub 2}O{sub 7}, the magnitude of the transverse thermal vibrational mode is at the limit of being detectable by SCXRD and likely not observable by PDF analysis. Here we report the preliminary results of our study on the nature of the thermal expansion behavior of Tc{sub 2}O{sub 7}. The transverse thermal vibration mode compression mechanism is considered and compared to the pressure induced twisted distortion mechanism predicted at high pressure.

"Evaluation of Bentonite Engineered Barrier Performance under Repository Conditions","Pope, Rachel N.; Powell, Brian A.; Schlautman, Mark A.","12 MANAGEMENT OF RADIOACTIVE WASTES, AND NON-RADIOACTIVE WASTES FROM NUCLEAR FACILITIES; ADSORPTION; BENTONITE; LEACHING; MONTMORILLONITE; NUCLEAR ENERGY; OXIDATION; PERFORMANCE; RADIOACTIVE WASTES; RADIOACTIVITY; SMECTITE; SOLUBILITY; SPENT FUELS; UNDERGROUND STORAGE; WATER INFLUX","Nuclear energy has been an important source of power throughout the world for several decades, but with that power comes substantial amounts of waste. The USA alone is projected to produce 77,100 MTHM (34,700 MCi) of commercial spent fuel by the year 2020. There has been a growing sense of urgency to determine a method of disposal for all types of nuclear waste. Underground storage has been proposed as the safest means of long term storage and disposal by both the Academy of Sciences and the Blue Ribbon Commission with a focus on deep geologic disposal. Because deep geological repositories (DGR) pose as the safest method of disposal due to the isolation of the waste and the low-permeability of the surrounding material, it is crucial to understand the science behind these repositories. Many scientists have concern with DGRs because of all the unanswered scientific questions. With a global inventory of 300,000 MTHM, it is imperative to understand how DGRs will retain the nuclear waste over a time span of up to a projected 1 million years. Because of the amount of nuclear waste increases each year, there is an inherent need to study the viability of a repository in order to begin implementation of that repository. Based on the half-lives of each radionuclide in nuclear waste, after approximately 100 years of storage, the heat production from the decay of radionuclides becomes dominated by the long-lived actinides. Because the decay of the nuclear waste results in an elevated temperature within the canister, That mixed with water intrusion can corrode the canister and allow radionuclides to leach into the surrounding environment. In an effort to retain these radionuclides within the repositories, most all deep geologic repository designs incorporate an engineered multi-barrier approach. Once the radionuclides begin to leach out of the canisters, the next barrier to retain them is a layer of compacted clay such as a smectite. A mechanistic understanding of mobility at elevated temperatures is crucial in order to evaluate the performance of the engineered clay barrier system within a deep geological repository. Because the clay barrier is compacted so tightly, the only method of mobility for radionuclides is through molecular diffusion. Assessing the factors that affect the rates at which various radionuclides will diffuse through these clays is important in the performance assessment of the repository system as a whole. Neptunium-237 has been identified as a major actinide of concern for long term storage, dominating the radioactivity emitted from the waste between 10,000 to 100,000 years of storage. Under oxidizing conditions, this radionuclide exists mainly as Np(V). In this oxidation state, the neptunium exists chemically as the NpO{sub 2}{sup +} ion which exhibits enhanced mobility characteristics such as high solubility and low affinity for sorption to surfaces. Because of this, {sup 237}Np(V) has been identified as the most mobile radionuclide in nuclear waste and thus a major radionuclide of concern, motivating research into the mobility of {sup 237}Np(V) through the compacted clay barrier. Bentonite is one of the most common backfill materials used in repositories. This clayey rock's main constituent is the mineral Na-montmorillonite [(Ca{sub 0.06}Na{sub 0.14}K{sub 0.05})(Al{sub 1.57}Fe{sup 3+} {sub 0.17}Mg{sub 0.25})(Al{sub 0.04}Si{sub 3.96}O{sub 10} - (OH){sub 2})] which gives this material the advantageous properties required for a repository such as a high swelling capacity. Because of this high affinity for absorbing water, montmorillonite is the ideal candidate for backfill material in a deep geological repository. Adsorption of radionuclides onto the surface of the compacted clay is a major mechanism for retardation of mobility. Because diffusion and adsorption are integrated into this process, it is important to characterize Np adsorption onto the surface of compacted montmorillonite. Previous studies have quantified the adsorption of Np onto montmorillonite at variable ionic strengths and temperatures.

Interim storage of spent nuclear fuel in dry storage systems (DSS) has gained additional importance and urgency for resolving waste-management-related technical issues. DOE has established research and development objectives to create technologies and solutions that can improve the reliability, sustain the safety while extending the life of nuclear facilities. To achieve this objective, nondestructive evaluation and monitoring of structural material conditions is highly desired to be integrated into the fuel cycle to quantify the 'state of health' and more importantly, to guarantee the safe operation of existing facilities during their predicted life span. Ultrasonics based NDE approach relies on elastic waves to achieve broad coverage across a range of material types and failure modes. Within the ultrasonic waves family, the guided ultrasonic waves (GUW) that propagate through the solid waveguides while interacting with the waveguide surface(s) are widely used due to their sensitivity to degradation through the thickness as well as their capability to provide area-wise inspection compared to the traditional point-wise inspection by pressure waves. To address the need for NDE of the steel canisters inside the DSS, an acoustic-ultrasonics (AU) NDE methodology has been under development utilizing the guided ultrasonic waves. Fundamental methods of using GUW in various modes to sensing and detection with various sensor technologies are present in this paper.

This is of particular concern as the processing (i.e., cold rolling) and construction (welding) of storage canisters produce an inherent residual stress in metals that can lead to SCC. In this context, our objective is to study the formation of stress corrosion cracks within Type 304L stainless steel, which is frequently used in containers for used nuclear fuel disposal. The conditions present in storage canisters (i.e., elevated temperatures, high residual stresses near welds, and exposure to humidity and chloride) make them susceptible to SCC, potentially leading to critical through-wall failure, and thus loss of containment. The timescales on which through-wall failure is expected in a storage canister under typical conditions is on the order of tens of years. While through-wall flaws are catastrophic (e.g., release of helium and fission gases), the long timescales allow for routine inspection, and potentially mitigation, providing methods exist. This paper is focused on the former problem, i.e. detection of SCC, and the development of a tool for inspection of storage canisters. We will discuss the recent work we did on detecting the presence of SCC as well as imaging on its orientation and penetration depth using an acoustic technique developed at Los Alamos National Laboratory (LANL). This technique has been applied successfully in the laboratory on stainless steel samples with SCC provided by General Electric (GE) and the Electric Power Research Institute (EPRI). Recently, we have also demonstrated that this technique can be deployed for field inspections in tight and confined spaces.

The sensors used for this method are highly sensitive and do not typically need to be in relatively close proximity to the indication when compared to methods such as ultrasonic or eddy current testing. This characteristic makes acoustic emission an attractive method for monitoring locations that are not readily accessible to active inspection methods, such as with in-situ examination of dry cask storage system canisters. Acoustic emission is unique among nondestructive evaluation (NDE) methods as emission is caused by the energy released from the object inspected. Most NDE methods require that energy be introduced to the part from an external source; which is not necessary with acoustic emission. Acoustic emission signals are created during crack growth and plastic deformation. EPRI has been investigating the feasibility of using acoustic emission as a complementary NDE method for monitoring the structural condition of dry fuel storage canisters. To assess this feasibility three first of a kind field trials were conducted over a one year period. The goals of the field trials were to determine the potential path forward for the method and to assess needs for further research and development. Why this matters: The study evaluated the efficacy of structural health monitoring methods to support ISFSI license renewal commitments to support aging management of welded stainless steel canisters.

Some DCSS canisters (especially those located in coastal environments) will be exposed to marine environments, which can cause atmospheric stress corrosion cracking (SCC). Chloride deposits on canister surfaces provide the corrosive environment necessary for atmospheric SCC with the residual stresses and materials properties conditions. The most susceptible regions on the canister surface are the weld areas, or where cold work has been performed, and may provide the necessary driving force for crack growth. The heat-affected zones (HAZs) near welds are also potentially susceptible to atmospheric SCC due to sensitization of the material caused by chromium depletion during the welding process. Information collected from the field and from laboratory studies has not been able to rule out the possibility of atmospheric chloride induced stress corrosion cracking (CISCC), although no occurrences of atmospheric SCC in DCSS canisters have been detected to-date. A number of researchers have demonstrated that localized corrosion can take place under such situations on materials commonly used for interim storage containers, including 304SS (Cook et al. 2010; Shirai et al. 2011) and 316SS (Tani et al. 2009). In this summary, the preliminary results of a neutron activation analysis (NAA) and prompt gamma activation analysis (PGAA) are performed using MCNP6, a highly sophisticated, multi-particle Monte Carlo simulation code (with the employment of the high performance computing system at the Idaho National Laboratory), and confirm the feasibility of using PGAA and NAA as an environmental inspection methodology for detection and monitoring of small quantities of chlorine on canister surfaces. The specific signature of gamma rays due reactions of sea salt constituents are documented and summarized in this paper. The environmental constituent for passive oxide film breaching is chlorine, which can cause pitting initiation and incubation time that may lead to cracking in stainless steel. Therefore, an assessment of chloride presence at a canister surface is essential before moving to other nondestructive analysis (NDA) methods for detection of pitting and cracking. Two nonlinear acoustic techniques will also be used in our integrated research project (IRP) research study that proves to be useful in the detection of SCC: nonlinear resonant ultrasound spectroscopy (NRUS), and time revisited elastic nonlinear diagnostic (TREND). These two techniques are complementary to marine atmospheric detection techniques. In this presentation only PGAA and NAA are described in detail.

These radionuclides are {sup 3}H, {sup 14}C, {sup 85}Kr, and {sup 129}I. Although iodine has been the focus of a number of studies due to the high decontamination factor (DF) requirements on multiple escape pathways, it is clear from prior studies that the control of tritium will also be a significant issue for future reprocessing plants, especially if processing relatively short-cooled fuels (<10 yr post reactor discharge). Tritium contained in a used nuclear fuel (UNF) matrix will be released into the liquid and off-gas streams during fuel reprocessing. The amounts released into the process streams are a function of the type and burnup of the fuel processed, and the chemical processes employed within the reprocessing plant. Previous studies have examined the tritium capture requirements for the reprocessing facility assuming that all of the tritium is volatilized in the head-end operations; i.e., tritium pretreatment is employed and tritium is completely released from the cladding. This scenario tends to limit the release pathway to the head-end off-gas stream.

A final waste form for AgZ loaded with radioactive iodine has not yet been identified. The applicability of hot isostatic pressing (HIPing) to convert iodine-loaded, reduced silver-exchanged mordenite (I-Ag{sup 0}Z) into a suitable waste form is currently being evaluated at Oak Ridge National Laboratory (ORNL). Because production of such a waste form requires little preprocessing of the I-Ag{sup 0}Z, HIPing could prove very attractive from both safety and economic perspectives. It is desirable to produce a waste form with a distinct iodine-containing mineral phase as the major constituent. Such a mineral phase is thought to increase long-term iodine retention and overall stability. Furthermore, the transformation of the material into a known iodine-containing mineral phase would limit the additional experimental testing and modeling required to determine the long-term stability of the pressed pellet, as much of that information has already been learned for several common iodine-containing minerals. For these reasons, the current work has investigated the possibility of converting I-Ag{sup 0}Z into an iodine-containing sodalite, similar to the efforts documented by Sheppard et al. in which they transformed other silver zeolite structures into sodalite through HIPing. Building on our initial work we are now producing hot isostatically pressed waste forms using mixtures of pure sodium mordenite, AgZ, and silver iodide. The composition of these samples is well known, in contrast with the previously used commercially available, binder-containing AgZ, which has a composition that is proprietary and uncharacterized. It is expected that by controlling the initial sample composition, we might be able to control the mineral phases present in the processed waste form. Transformation of the component material into a well-characterized iodine-containing mineral phase would be desirable; however, this is not an absolute requirement for success.

The goals of the project are to provide confirmatory data for analytical model validation and potential improvement; to provide input to future dry storage cask design; to support license renewals and new licenses for Independent Spent Fuel Storage Installation facilities; and to support transportation licensing for high burnup used fuel. In support of these project goals, an instrumented TN-32B bolted-lid cask (the Research Project Cask or RPC) at the North Anna reactor site will be loaded with intact, HBU PWR fuel assemblies (Project Assemblies) having four different kinds of cladding: standard Zircaloy-4, low-tin Zircaloy-4, ZIRLO{sup R}, and M5{sup R}. In approximately ten years, the instrumented cask will be opened for inspection and several fuel rods from the Project Assemblies will be characterized. The project has also removed 25 'sister rods' from assemblies at North Anna: 9 directly from the project assemblies and 16 from similarly constructed and operated HBU assemblies. The 25 sister rods are all high burnup and cover the range of domestically-used cladding alloys. The 25 sister rods were shipped to Oak Ridge National Laboratory (ORNL) in early 2016 for detailed non-destructive examinations (NDE) followed by destructive examination (DE). Examination of the sister rods will provide a baseline for comparison with the cask rods and will allow for separate effects testing. Dry storage canister loading is completed under water in a designated area of the plant's spent fuel pool. In preparation for dry storage, the fuel assemblies and canister cavity must be drained and dried. Typically, the highest temperatures experienced by the fuel during dry storage are encountered either during drying or transfer of the canister to the storage pad; therefore, as a part of the sister rod testing these temperatures will be simulated in the lab to produce samples that are representative of the peak cladding temperature the fuel experiences either during drying, transfer, or storage.

"Spent Nuclear Fuel Package Consolidation using Metallic Void Fillers","Park, Yongsoo; McKrell, Thomas J.; Driscoll, Michael J.","12 MANAGEMENT OF RADIOACTIVE WASTES, AND NON-RADIOACTIVE WASTES FROM NUCLEAR FACILITIES; AFTER-HEAT; CONTAINERS; COOLING; FISSILE MATERIALS; HEAT; METALS; SOLIDIFICATION; SPENT FUELS; THERMODYNAMICS","This study introduces the idea of a consolidated spent nuclear fuel (SNF) package, formed by casting a metal into a SNF canister to fill any accessible void spaces. It is well known that castings experience shrinkage during cooling resulting in air gaps between the filler and its boundaries. For a consolidated SNF package, the air gap formed between the metallic filler and package components would have a negative impact on the thermal effusivity benefit offered by the filler. Here we present one solution to this challenge based on thermodynamic/solidification and metallic bonding principles. The key idea here is to pre-coat the package components with a low melting point metal, and to oxidize the coating instead of the components during the pre-heating step of the casting process. This allows for wetting of the boundary with the filler metal without the use of a flux that wouldn't survive the preheat temperature and could also contaminate the boundary with corrosive compounds. Potential benefits of successfully adopting this idea are twofold. First, improved heat diffusion inside the package due to the absence of the gap, which is significant for conceptual SNF with higher decay heat and high peak to average ratio. Second, improved proliferation resistance by making the fissile material recovery process more complex.

The electrometallurgical reprocessing of used metallic fuels to recover U and Pu generates two waste streams: salt waste comprised of electro-refiner salt contaminated with oxidized fission products and metallic waste comprised of activated cladding and metallic fission products that were not oxidized under the processing conditions. Metallic waste forms can be made by directly melting the cladding and fuel wastes with small amounts of trim metals to form a multiphase alloy material in which radionuclides and other waste constituents are immobilized within chemically durable intermetallic and iron-based solid solution phases. Some components of the waste streams serve as important constituents of phases comprising the waste form, such as Mo and Zr, which form Fe{sub 2}Mo and Fe{sub 2}Zr intermetallic phases. Other waste constituents are accommodated as substitutional contaminants, such as Tc within the Fe{sub 2}Mo intermetallic and U/TRU within the Fe{sub 2}Zr intermetallic. Sufficient amounts of these host phases must be available to accommodate all radionuclides in the waste stream. The compositional flexibility of the host phases to incorporate waste components is being utilized to formulate metal waste forms that will accommodate variations in waste streams compositions that will occur over long-term fuel reprocessing operations. Small amounts of trim metals can be added to tailor the phase assembly to match the waste stream composition and facilitate waste form processing. For example, additional Zr may be added during waste form production to ensure all U/TRU is sequestered in a durable Fe{sub 2}Zr host phase and trim Cr, Mo, and Ni can be added to supplement the amounts provided by the steel cladding to improve the durability of a metallic waste form.

"Accelerated Corrosion Tests to Evaluate Long-Term Performance of BORAL{sup R} in Spent Fuel Pools","Akkurt, Hatice; Quigley, Ashleigh; Harris, Matt","11 NUCLEAR FUEL CYCLE AND FUEL MATERIALS; 12 MANAGEMENT OF RADIOACTIVE WASTES, AND NON-RADIOACTIVE WASTES FROM NUCLEAR FACILITIES; ALUMINIUM; BORON CARBIDES; CLADDING; CORROSION; CRITICALITY; FUEL STORAGE POOLS; MICROSCOPY; NEUTRON ABSORBERS; NUCLEAR POWER PLANTS; SAFETY MARGINS; SPECTROSCOPY; SPENT FUELS","Neutron absorber materials are used to increase storage capacity in spent fuel pools (SFPs) while maintaining criticality safety margins. BORAL{sup R} - a neutron absorber material commonly used in SFPs - is a metal matrix composite containing boron carbide (B{sub 4}C) and Al-1100 mixture. The aluminum (Al) cladding, which is on both sides of the core, serves as a protective barrier. Al cladding is susceptible to corrosion, which can lead to blisters between the core material and the cladding over time. Based on operational experience to date, pits also have been observed via visual examination and microscopy. EPRI has maintained a database containing coupon data spanning more than 25 years, and to date no loss of BORAL{sup R} efficacy has been observed. In the United States, about 50% of the plants use BORAL{sup R} as neutron absorber material in SFPs. BORAL{sup R} is also used in nuclear plants in Mexico, Korea, Taiwan, and other countries. Given that the plant lifetime is increasing-and, hence, the SFP lifetime-EPRI initiated a five-year accelerated corrosion test in 2013 to evaluate and determine the long-term performance of BORAL{sup R} in SFPs. This paper presents an overview of the accelerated corrosion test project. Results from the Year 1 and Year 2 test results are also presented.

It is important to improve this technology with respect to nuclear materials detection and accountability. Artificial Neural Intelligence (ANI) is a novel data analysis and simulation method that can be applied to electrochemical data sets. This computational code, which has been performed using the commercial software MATLAB, can be trained to generalize adequate electrical current and potential simulated data sets for the unseen data with a high accuracy of prediction. For this purpose, a massive collection of cyclic voltammetry (CV) data sets by Hoover (2014), for 0.5, 1, 2.5, and 5 wt% of zirconium chloride in LiCl-KCl molten salt with different scan rates at 773 K has been considered. The computer is trained via ANI to predict the unseen data after providing suitable hidden layers and validation numbers. In addition, this work can trace the CV plot for a blind condition by interpolating between two simulated data set. The different hidden layers with various neurons (from 5 to 30) at several validation numbers (from 5 to 30) has been studied and the average percent error between experimental and theoretical data for 0.5 wt% with 200 and 450 mV/s has been calculated. Preliminary results demonstrate that if the number of hidden layers increases from one to three, the average error falls down from 44% to around 8%. The best condition which gives a minimum average percent error has been discovered and the simulated CV graph has been compared with the experimental data.

Molten-salt pyroprocessing has been developed for treating both oxide and metal spent nuclear fuels. This process separates long-lived actinide isotopes together as a group from fission products for burning the long-lived isotopes in fast reactors. Main processes of pyroprocessing such as oxide reduction, electrorefining, and electrowinning are based on a concept of electrolytic cell consuming energy to proceed electrochemical reactions. To scale-up the electrochemical processes, the design optimization of the key steps is required to reach high throughput that improves economic competitiveness and reduces an environmental impact. For the optimization, it is significant to compare different unit process designs and find optimum designs and operating conditions. However, this optimization process is very costly if we need to conduct experiments on every case with spent nuclear fuel. Instead, a validated simulation model can help to rapidly calculate and evaluate different case at significantly reduced costs. This paper presents recent development of multi-physics simulation of molten salt electrochemistry for partitioning spent nuclear fuel with limiting factors.

In detector systems, a minimum time must separate two different events before they can be measured individually. That minimum time interval is called to be deadtime of detector system. There are two commonly deadtime models: the paralyzing and the non-paralyzing models. Paralyzing model assumes that each event during the deadtime will reset the deadtime and deadtime extension will depend on the count rate. According to the non-paralyzing model, deadtime is fixed after each detected event and all events occurring during deadtime are lost. In this study, deadtime measurements have been obtained for an N-Probe fast neutron (NE-213 Liquid Scintillation) detector manufactured by BTI (Bubble Technology Industries) using a combination of the attenuation law and the assumption of ideal paralyzing and non-paralyzing method. Bubble Technology Industries (BTI) has manufactured a portable neutron scintillation spectrometer (N-Probe) with potential applications at nuclear reactor facilities, waste processing operations, and spent fuel storage areas. The deadtime of the N-Probe detector is not provided by the manufacturer; BTI, and there is no other study published on the N-Probe detector' deadtime. Since the detector will be used in future nuclear fuel investigations, it is important to determine the detector' deadtime for accurate nuclear fuel analysis. The deadtime of the BTI N-Probe was examined using different thicknesses of Plexiglas at the Missouri University of Science and Technology Reactor (MSTR) using attenuation law and average macroscopic cross-section of Plexiglas defined by both paralyzing and non-paralyzing model.

"Probabilistic Risk Assessment of Spent Fuel Pool Cooling System Failure Considering Safety and Security Initiating Events","Hawila, Mohammad A.; Chirayath, Sunil S.","12 MANAGEMENT OF RADIOACTIVE WASTES, AND NON-RADIOACTIVE WASTES FROM NUCLEAR FACILITIES; 97 MATHEMATICAL METHODS AND COMPUTING; COOLING SYSTEMS; FUEL STORAGE POOLS; HAZARDS; INTERVENORS; PHYSICAL PROTECTION; PROBABILISTIC ESTIMATION; RADIATION PROTECTION; RADIATION SOURCES; RISK ASSESSMENT; SOURCE TERMS; SPENT FUEL STORAGE; SPENT FUELS; VULNERABILITY","In order to quantify the probable risk associated with a safety system, nuclear safety risk evaluation process is applied which is generally performed in three steps. The first step is to calculate the damage frequency of a critical system. This step is followed by the radioactive source term estimation due to the potential system damage. The final step is the assessment of off-site consequences. The safety risk formula is shown by Eq. (1). P{sub F} is the probability of safety system failure (the probability used describes a random, independent event), and C is the consequence value. R{sub SAF} = P{sub F} * C (1) The security risk associated with an attack on critical infrastructure and/or special nuclear materials theft is usually evaluated using three- term risk equation (probability of attack, probability of adversary success, and consequence). A security threat and the related initiating events are not considered in a pure safety risk analysis. The vulnerability of the physical protection system is performed independently even though the consequence resulting from a security initiating event can be similar to a safety related initiating event and thus gets double counted. The security risk can be calculated using Eq. (2) R{sub SEC} = P{sub A} * P{sub S} * C (2) PA is the probability of attack, P{sub S} is the probability of adversary success (P{sub S} = 1 - P{sub I} P{sub N}). P{sub I} being the probability of interruption which accounts for the probabilities of detection of all timely detection elements along an adversary path. PN being the probability of neutralization: the result of engagement of the response force with the adversaries after the interruption has occurred. C is the consequence magnitude from a successful attack. The two security probabilities do not describe random, independent events. As a result, because of the differences in the randomness and independence of the respective safety and security probabilities, the safety and the security risks are currently calculated separately. The consequence term in nuclear safety and security risk evaluation have the same definition. An effort is made here to study the effect on the overall risk by considering security initiating events along with the subsequent failure of the intermediate safety element. The target selected is a spent fuel storage pool for analyzing the public risk arising from the interplay between nuclear security and safety initiating events. EASI (Estimate of Adversary Sequence Interruption) model is used to calculate the probability of interruption related to a security system that leads to the calculation of the security initiating event frequency. Further progression of this initiating security event to a top event is analyzed using a Probabilistic Safety Assessment (PSA) tool, SAPHIRE (version 8) to obtain a joint pool damage frequency. For the progression of events leading to a top event, the failure of the intermediate safety elements is assumed to be external random events such as heavy load drop and fire events. The objectives of this study is to (1) determine the double accounting of frequency of failure, risk and allocated resources in the scenario of a non-random security initiating event leading to a safety random event chain (2) compare the damage frequency from pure security with the frequency of combined security-safety failure event and pure safety failure events.

To harness the full nuclear energy potential and flatten the flux around the core, fuel assemblies are shuffled to one or more different locations within the core. Post-irradiation practice typically involves storing the spent fuel assembly in a spent fuel pool. While in the spent fuel pool, aspects of the fuel assembly continue to evolve, particularly the isotopic concentration as nuclides decay. Numerous nondestructive assay (NDA) safeguards techniques exist and have been proposed for performing verification on spent fuel assemblies to ensure they have not been tampered with. Adigun et al. recently proposed measuring both the neutron and gamma signatures from spent fuel from discharge to final disposal, however, the research in only investigated the neutron part of this approach. In the conclusion, the authors caveated the need for the gamma results to make more certain conclusions about a spent fuel assembly, as a combination of the neutron and gamma NDA measurements will limit the range of possible initial enrichment and burnup combinations. This paper focuses on the production of the gamma source. It is important to understand the driving mechanisms behind the emissions signatures at shutdown and after long cooling time periods, to better determine the correlation between the measured passive gamma emission spectra and the gamma emissions per second of the assembly. The objective is to demonstrate how the effect of localized flux within a reactor affects the gamma emissions per second (or gamma intensity) present in an assembly at shutdown. This study examined the photons emitted from the nuclides present within the fuel assembly, and not the photons escaping from the fuel assembly. The latter point of transporting the photons present within the spent fuel assemblies to an appropriate detector will be addressed in a future paper.

Though Cs-137 concentration information is used for burnup estimation in conventional spent nuclear fuels, it could not be applied for damaged nuclear fuel of severe accidents because of both a large release fraction of Cs and significant change of its shape and form by core melting. The ratio of {sup 134}Cs/{sup 137}Cs has often been used as an index of the burnup in the cleanup of TMI-2 and the Chernobyl Drum Assay System in Chernobyl-4 and other cleanup activities, assuming that the Cs isotope ratio inside the fuel matrix would be the same as in the fuel debris, whereas its retention fraction would vary. Cs retention fraction information would be very important for the reliability of the burnup estimation as well as for the severe accident safety analysis. In the present research, a principle of new technique to estimate the Cs retention fraction is proposed and examined by sensitivity analysis of the FP inventory in conventional BWR irradiated fuel numerically, and validated by comparing the past experimental data based on gamma spectrometry.

A concern raised when this zero-discharge policy was first considered was that radioactive tritium produced during plant operation would be concentrated in reactor plant water due to the reduced rate at which tritiated water is replaced with makeup water. Elevated concentration of tritium in plant systems could result in internal exposure, especially during refueling outages when personnel are working in the vicinity of the reactor cavity. Tritium data before and after implementation of the zero-discharge policy demonstrate that there has been no significant effect on tritium concentration in plant systems.

The ELAP (Extended Loss of Alternating Current Power) and LUHS (Loss of Ultimate Heat Sink) events severely damaged the core cooling systems and the safety functions of the containment. As a result, three reactor cores were damaged. Also, the cooling capability of nuclear spent fuel pools was lost due to loss of AC and DC power. Existing Station Blackout (SBO) analyses have demonstrated that even with leakage from Reactor Coolant Pump (RCP) seals, the core could maintain coolable only when heat transfer exists between primary loop and secondary loop. Depend on the availability of DC power in different plant designs, the SBO coping times were shown to be 4 to 16 hours. According to INPO event report, it is necessary to analyze the consequences if current coping times are extended with increased core water inventory loss from pump seals. In an ELAP scenario, all active system including Emergency Core Cooling System (ECCS) and motor driven AFW were out of power supply, results in degradation of core cooling capability. Moreover, the fuel exposed risk would increase due to continuously Reactor Coolant System (RCS) inventory loss through pump seals. Therefore, mitigation strategy must be applied prior to core uncovering to prevent its damage and assure plant safety. This research utilized a fast running NPP safety simulation code, PCTRAN, to assess reactor performances in the situations of ELAP of Maanshan PWR. Also, the sensitivity study of injection flow rates and effectiveness of mitigation strategy were demonstrated.

"Chloride-Induced Stress Corrosion Cracking Characteristics of the Used Nuclear Fuel Canister Material","Xie, Yi; Zhang, Jinsuo","36 MATERIALS SCIENCE; 12 MANAGEMENT OF RADIOACTIVE WASTES, AND NON-RADIOACTIVE WASTES FROM NUCLEAR FACILITIES; AFTER-HEAT; AIR FLOW; AUSTENITIC STEELS; CHEMICAL COMPOSITION; CHLORINE IONS; CORROSION RESISTANCE; CRACKING; DRY STORAGE; ION BEAMS; MICROSTRUCTURE; NUCLEAR FUELS; OXIDES; PITTING CORROSION; RESIDUAL STRESSES; SALT DEPOSITS; SCANNING ELECTRON MICROSCOPY; SPECTROSCOPY; STRESS CORROSION; TRANSMISSION ELECTRON MICROSCOPY; WELDING","The used nuclear fuel (UNF) dry storage systems are located in the coastal and lake/river-side regions, the service time of which is 60 years and more. One type of dry storage systems is composite of a thin-walled austenitic stainless steel (SS) welded canister and a concrete overpack. The air flows through the canister surface and brings away the decay heat. Meanwhile, the air brings the salt species into the canister and make them deposit on the surface. The salt deposit will be deliquescent when absorbing the moisture air, being corrosive to the surface. NRC and other programs claimed that chloride induced stress corrosion cracking (CISCC) would lead to the canister failure, being one of the major technical gaps for extended dry storage systems. CISCC is induced by the combined influence of the aggressive environment (chloride ions in our case) and tensile stresses (residual stresses in our case) on the susceptible materials (the austenitic SS in our case). Chrome (Cr), as one of the chemical compositions of SSs, plays an important role in the corrosion resistance. It can form a chrome-rich inner barrier oxide layer to prevent the SS from corrosion. However, chloride ions can easily break down the barrier and accelerate dissolution of the underlying metal, the phenomena of which is pitting corrosion. Pitting is the precursor to CISCC as which provides the combination of a local aggressive solution chemistry and a stress concentrating feature. Accordingly, CISCC invariably originates from the pits, and cracks that have nucleated on pit walls can grow around the pit and coalesce to form a complete through-crack. Significant tensile residual stresses, caused by the welding process, exist throughout the thickness of the canister wall. Enos and Bryan found that large residual stresses were in the full-scale mockup container simulating a canister, which supports the SCC propagation. It is therefore interesting to achieve a good knowledge about the effect of welding on the durability of SSs, especially in the corrosive environment. In order to understand the fundamental of the cracking behaviors, it's vital to elucidate the microstructure and microchemistry of cracking. This study focused on observing the CISCC characteristics of the UNF canister material exposed to the humid environment with salt deposit. Extensive micro-characteristics have been achieved by the techniques include focused ion beam/ scanning electron microscope (FIB/SEM), transmission electron microscopy (TEM), energy dispersive spectroscopy (EDS), and optical profiler.

"Fundamental Properties for Evaluation of Uranium-free TRU-Zr Metal Fuel Performance","Tsuboi, Yasushi; Arie, Kazuo; Papesch, Cynthia; Miller, Brandon; Mariani, Robert D.; Arita, Yuji; Ohta, Hirokazu","11 NUCLEAR FUEL CYCLE AND FUEL MATERIALS; 12 MANAGEMENT OF RADIOACTIVE WASTES, AND NON-RADIOACTIVE WASTES FROM NUCLEAR FACILITIES; CONVERSION RATIO; FAST REACTORS; FISSION; FUEL CYCLE; MODIFICATIONS; NATURAL URANIUM; NEUTRON REACTIONS; PERFORMANCE; PLUTONIUM; RADIOACTIVE WASTE DISPOSAL; RADIOACTIVE WASTES; SPENT FUELS; WATER COOLED REACTORS; WATER MODERATED REACTORS","FR (Fast Reactor) is widely recognized to effectively burn plutonium and MA (Minor Actinides) (i.e., TRU: Transuranic) due to its higher fission-to-neutron-capture ratio compared to LWR. When TRU in LWR (Light Water Reactor) spent fuel is recycled into FR cycle, the radiotoxicity of the residual nuclear wastes from LWR spent fuel is reduced to natural uranium level after several hundred years instead of more than hundreds of thousand years for no recycling case. It could significantly improve public perception to nuclear waste disposal and might reduce the burden of the disposal. However, U-TRU-fueled fast reactors also produce TRU while burning TRU because they use uranium together with TRU. For example, FR, even with low conversion ratio of 0.75, burns only 0.18 t TRU/GWe/y, while LWRs produces about 0.22 t TRU/GWe/y. It is not a realistic scenario which needs almost the same capacity of fast reactors as that of LWRs to continuously burn TRU at LWR-dominant era in the near term at least. Therefore, a FR system to burn TRU from LWR with the minimum reactor units is desirable. The most effective way is to use uranium-free TRU fuel since it does not produce any new TRU. It can reduce the capacity of the TRU burner units and the associated fuel cycle facilities to about 1/5 and 1/8 respectively. Metal fuel FR cycle is considered to be one of the most promising ways because uranium-free TRU metal fuel could be recycled by pyro-process for U-Pu-Zr metal fuel without large modifications. This paper shows the recent research progress on fundamental properties of uranium-free TRU metal fuel.

The responsibility starts from when the fuel leaves the NPP and ends at the planned final repository. That means that SKB has the responsible for the safety at the intermediate pool storage (Clab), the encapsulation plant (Clink), the Spent Fuel Repository and the transportation between these sites. In March 2011 SKB applied to the Swedish Radiation Safety Authority (SSM) for a permit to build a final repository for spent fuel and an encapsulation plant (Clink). The application contained a criticality safety analysis for the canisters to be used in Clink and the copper canister to be used in the final repository. In 2012 SSM requested several complements to the criticality safety analysis in the application and about the same time they also required Clab to modernise the Safety Analysis Report. Our owners (the NPPs) had also requested SKB to take care of higher enrichments and higher burnup fuel. A prerequisite to meet this was extended Burnable Absorber credit (peak reactivity) and Burn-up credit. Up to this stage SKB had relied heavily on consultants to do criticality safety analysis and had no specific criticality safety program or methodology. However it was now evident to SKB that we needed to take an overall view on the criticality safety area and not only lift the quality of the actual criticality analysis but also to handle organisational and competence issues.

BORAL{sup R} is a commonly used neutron absorber material for both wet (SFPs) and dry storage (casks). The specific questions surrounding fixed neutron absorber materials include the following: 1. What are the conditions of the neutron absorber panels in SFPs? Is there any gross degradation that could cause potential concern for criticality safety of the pools? 2. Is the coupon monitoring approach adequate for monitoring the conditions of the panels as part of an aging management program? 3. For plants that do not have coupons, do current in situ measurement approaches provide accurate results? Could such in situ approaches be used as an alternative monitoring approach? In order to shed light on these technical questions using actual plant data, EPRI initiated the Zion comparative analysis project at the decommissioning Zion Nuclear Power Plant in late 2014. An overview of the Zion plant, SFP, and project was described in a previous publication.

"Impact of Americium-241 (n,γ) Branching Ratio on SFR Core Reactivity and Spent Fuel Characteristics","Hiruta, Hikaru; Youinou, Gilles J.; Dixon, Brent W.","21 SPECIFIC NUCLEAR REACTORS AND ASSOCIATED PLANTS; 12 MANAGEMENT OF RADIOACTIVE WASTES, AND NON-RADIOACTIVE WASTES FROM NUCLEAR FACILITIES; ACTINIDES; AMERICIUM 241; BRANCHING RATIO; CROSS SECTIONS; ENERGY DEPENDENCE; ENERGY RANGE; FAST REACTORS; FUEL CYCLE; NEUTRON SPECTRA; NUCLEAR DATA COLLECTIONS; PERFORMANCE; REACTIVITY; SODIUM COOLED REACTORS; SPENT FUELS; THERMAL REACTORS","An accurate prediction of core physics and fuel cycle parameters largely depends on the order of details and accuracy in nuclear data taken into account for actual calculations. {sup 241}Am is a major gateway nuclide for most of the minor actinides and thus an important nuclide for core physics and fuel-cycle calculations. The {sup 241}Am(n,γ) branching ratio (BR) is in fact energy dependent, therefore, it is necessary to taken into account the spectrum effect on the calculation of the average BR for the full-core depletion calculations. Moreover, the accuracy of the BR used in the depletion calculations could significantly influence the core physics performance and post irradiated fuel compositions. The BR of {sup 241}Am(n,γ) in the ENDF/B-VII.0 library is relatively small and flat in the thermal energy range, gradually increases within the intermediate energy range, and even becomes larger in the fast energy range. This indicates that the properly collapsed BR for fast reactors could be significantly different from that of thermal reactors. The evaluated BRs also differ from one evaluation to another. As seen in Table I, average BRs for several evaluated libraries calculated by means of a fast spectrum are similar but have some differences. While some of widely available and used depletion codes, such as ORIGEN in SCALE, have a capability to calculate a variable BR based on the system neutron spectrum, most of the currently available depletion codes still use a pre-determined single value BR for each library. However, ideally it should be determined on an on-the-fly basis like that of one-group cross sections. These issues provide a strong incentive to investigate the effect of different {sup 241}Am(n,γ) BRs on core and spent fuel parameters. This paper investigates the impact of the {sup 241}Am(n,γ) BR on the results of sodium-cooled fast reactor (SFR) full-core based fuel-cycle calculations. The analysis is performed by gradually increasing the value of BR from 0.15 to 0.25 and studying its impact on the core reactivity and characteristics of SFR spent fuels over extended storage times (∼10,000 years).

But the fast reactor cores of this type usually have high positive coolant void reactivity worth resulted from the high TRU (Transuranics) contents in the high burnup, which can degrade the inherent safety through high positive coolant expansion reactivity coefficient. Recently, the authors have designed new small ultra-long-life cores that can be operated over 50{approx}60 EFPYs (Effective Full Power Years) and satisfy the self-controllability conditions under the unprotected accidents. The cores use axial blanket-driver-blanket configuration to achieve ultra-long operational cycle length where the fuel burnup propagates from the outer core to the inner core and from the axially central driver to the outer blanket regions. The objective of this work is to suggest the different design options with thorium addition and TRU and uranium from PWR spent fuels for effectively utilizing the large PWR spent fuel stocks and to analyze the performances of the cores.

It can also be used to produce fissile from fertile nuclides as fuels for another reactor. The breed-and-burn fast reactor (B and BR) is a unique concept of fast reactor, which can breed the fissile fuels and use the bred fuels in situ. Thanks to this characteristic, the fuel utilization in a B and BR can be extremely high and even the recycled fuel of a B and BR can be used as a fuel to spawn the next generation B and BR. The UNF from the first B and BR should be reprocessed or reconditioned so that it can be reused in the second B and BR. A fuel reprocessing technology named melt refining was used in EBR-II from 1964 to 1969 and it was also applied in our previous study which showed that second B and BR can be started using the recycled UNF of first B and BR. However, about 95% of rare earths are removed during the melt refining and the associated processes are not very simple. Moreover, the actinide loss can also be significant. To enhance the proliferation-resistance and economy of the reprocessing, a super-simplified melt and treatment (SSMT) process without removing rare earth nuclides is suggested and the feasibility study to start the second B and BR using SSMT is carried out in this paper. The neutronics simulations were done using the Monte Carlo code McCARD in conjunction with ENDF/B-VII cross-section library.

The sites of U.S. Department of Energy hold 6.5 trillion liters of contaminated groundwater and 40 million cubic meters of soil and debris contaminated with radionuclides, metals, and organics. The deactivation and decommissioning process (D and D) involves conversion of active, excess, and/or abandoned facilities to a final disposition. Because of residual radioactivity and dangerous chemicals, and the physical condition of these facilities, D and D presents unique hazards that must be addressed from safety, environmental, programmatic, and technological standpoints. This problem calls for development of informed D and D strategies including in-situ decommissioning, efficacy of D and D operations, productivity and personnel safety of D and D operation, facilitation of acceptable facility end-states, and independent verification. To identify and address D and D risks and challenges, innovative applications and timely insertion of existing commercially available technologies, processes and robotics or remote hardware are necessary. Aerial robotic unmanned autonomous systems (UAS) enable remote sensing operations. To address the needs of UAS-based sensing and sampling applications, we are developing plug-and-play interchangeable components for integration into the UAS: a neutron/gamma radiation sensor, a gas sensor for detection of vapors in air, and a miniature manipulator.

The purpose is to better understand the dynamics of heat transfer within the system, in order to provide support for the optimization of the Hanford Waste Treatment Plant (WTP) that will be used for vitrification of legacy tank waste. The simulation presented here is for the DM1200 pilot-scale system, which has been operated by the Vitreous State Laboratory (VSL) over the past several decades. This system is about one-third of the scale of the full size WTP melter. Experimental data from this system is being used to validate computational simulations. The examination of the melter with a fully coupled CFD model should give an accurate assessment of the heat transfer into the reactive cold cap region. Heat is provided to the cold cap region from conduction and convection from the molten glass pool as well as radiation from the hot plenum above the cold cap. The CFD model implements a mathematical model of the cold cap developed for the assessment of the melting rate during the vitrification of tank waste. This sub-model implemented directly into the CFD model combines the mass and enthalpy balance of the cold cap together with the conversion kinetics of the feed.

The package 9975 is a DOE certified package that has been used in the DOE complex for transportation and long term storage of radioactive material. The NCT and HAC thermal analyses for the 9975 package were performed here by taking a computational heat transfer method. The HAC thermal models described here are identical to the models in the current DOE certified 9975 package. Thermal models in this work are for an undamaged package to meet all the regulatory requirements during an HAC thermal event. The model was created using modified shielding where the lead was encapsulated in a 0.036 inches stainless steel casing. The impact of this casing was studied earlier when the modification was proposed and it was found to have minimal impact on the component temperatures. Therefore, the analyses in this paper are good for packages with or without the shielding modifications. Analytical studies show that the realistic value for the solar absorptivity for the stainless steel surface fabricated from the rolling operation is about 0.5. The NCT analyses documented in this report use an absorptivity value of 0.5 to get more realistic component temperature results. Sensitivity studies were also performed to assess the impact of variability in the solar absorptivity for drum surface in the previous work for the NRC certification. The analysis in this paper is based on PuO{sub 2} in a food can. The food can is considered uncredited convenience containers inside the Primary Containment Vessel (PCV) of the 9975 package. PCV is located inside Secondary Containment Vessel (SCV). PuO{sub 2} has a density of 2 g/cc and a heat generation rate of 19 watts. This calculation evaluates the thermal performance for 9975 package with food can configuration during NCT and HAC per NRC regulations in 10 CFR Part 71. The objective of the calculation is to demonstrate that the maximum component temperatures are below their design limits.

These radionuclides are {sup 3}H, {sup 14}C, {sup 85}Kr, and {sup 129}I. Previous studies have discussed the need for treating off-gas streams to control {sup 3}H, {sup 14}C, {sup 85}Kr, and {sup 129}I from the reprocessing of used nuclear fuel (UNF) and the regulations that set the limits for releases from such a facility. These regulations ultimately prescribe the decontamination factor (DF) that must be met in the facility. Jubin et al. examined the role of off-gas pathways since the gaseous radionuclides can partition to different reprocessing off-gas streams. Based on this report and subsequent analysis, the required DF for {sup 129}I could be 1000 to 3000. The required DF for {sup 3}H could be as high as 200, depending on the age of the fuel processed. The DF for {sup 85}Kr could be up to ∼35, also depending on fuel age. The required DF for {sup 14}C is 1 in many cases (no treatment required) but could be higher in specific cases. While iodine has been the focus of a number of studies due to the high DF requirements on multiple escape pathways, it is clear from the studies noted above that the control of tritium will also be a significant issue for future reprocessing plants, especially if processing relatively short-cooled fuels (<10 yr post reactor discharge). Tritium contained in a UNF matrix will be released into the liquid and off-gas streams during fuel reprocessing. The amount released into the process streams is a function of the type and burnup of the fuel processed, and the chemical processes employed within the reprocessing plant. Previous studies have examined the tritium capture requirements for the reprocessing facility assuming that all of the tritium is volatilized in the head-end operations, i.e., tritium pretreatment is employed and tritium is completely released from the cladding. This is clearly a worst case scenario from the standpoint of the amount of tritium that could be released, but the scenario tends to limit the release pathway to the head-end off-gas stream. In this analysis, the volume of HTO and the HTO to H{sub 2}O ratio for each of the three plant-wide tritium DFs were determined. The overall amount of HTO that had to be captured from the off-gas streams was virtually the same for the three DF cases evaluated; 98%, 99% and 99.5% of the tritium in the fuel entering the plant needed to be recovered for overall plant DFs of 50, 100 and 200, respectively. The use of the 'tritium barrier' to limit the spread of HTO from the head-end systems to the balance of the plant results in an increase in tritiated waste concentration in the head-end recycle acid systems which results in a decrease in the total amount of HTO + H{sub 2}O that must recovered from the gaseous effluent from the plant. The use of the 'tritium barrier' decreases the waste volume due to the higher HTO:H{sub 2}O ratio in the treated off-gas stream. The results also show that increasing the acid recycle percentage increases the concentration of HTO within the UNF reprocessing plant. This is then manifested in less HTO + H{sub 2}O that must be recovered from the gaseous effluents. Finally, the application of tritium recovery on the recycle acid reduces the HTO concentration in the recycle acid stream and generates a separate HTO + H{sub 2}O stream that must be managed. However, the resulting volume of tritium-containing waste generated plant-wide is a function of the selectivity of the tritium recovery system and the ability of the tritium recovery system to limit the accumulation of HTO in the recycle acid such that the HTO + H{sub 2}O recovered from gaseous effluents does not contribute significantly to the overall tritium waste volume.

"Adsorption and Transport Properties of Zeolite SAPO-34 for Krypton/Xenon Separations","Kwon, Yeon Hye; Benjamin, Emily; Pisharodi, Vivek; Hwang, Junyoung; Nair, Sankar; Bhave, Ramesh","12 MANAGEMENT OF RADIOACTIVE WASTES, AND NON-RADIOACTIVE WASTES FROM NUCLEAR FACILITIES; ADSORPTION; BOILING POINTS; CARBON 14; DISTILLATION; IODINE 129; KRYPTON; KRYPTON 85; MEMBRANES; MOLECULAR SIEVES; NUCLEAR FUELS; NUCLEAR POWER; NUCLEAR POWER PLANTS; PLUTONIUM; RADIOACTIVE WASTES; TRITIUM OXIDES; URANIUM; VAN DER WAALS FORCES; XENON 136; ZEOLITES","Nuclear power is an economical means of providing carbon-free energy, but requires effective ways to deal with the radioactive waste products. As part of the overall process for recycling used nuclear fuel (UNF), it is necessary to develop technologies to separate the off-gases formed during the fission of uranium and plutonium in nuclear power reactors. The off-gas contains {sup 129}I (radioisotope), NO, NO{sub 2}, CO{sub 2} containing {sup 14}C (radioisotope), {sup 3}H{sub 2}O (radioactive tritium oxide), {sup 85}Kr (radioisotope), and {sup 136}Xe. Separating and capturing each gas is essential to reduce the volume of radioactive waste for storage. Currently there exist economical technologies to separate {sup 129}I and {sup 14}CO{sub 2}. However, Kr and Xe separation is challenging because they are chemically inert and physically very similar. The Kr/Xe mixture is approximately 10/90 by volume and hence the separation of Kr would reduce the volume of radioactive {sup 85}Kr waste by a factor of 10. One way of separating them is by cryogenic distillation wherein they are condensed out as pure streams at very low temperature (Kr boiling point: -153 deg. C, Xe: -108 deg. C). Cryogenic distillation has intensive power requirements and a large system volume, resulting in high capital, operating, and disposal costs. Membrane-based separation using radiation-stable materials such as nanoporous zeolites is an attractive alternative, if membranes with sufficient Kr flux and selectivity can be fabricated. An ideal membrane process would permeate a stream of pure Kr for storage and also produce a retentate of pure Xe which has commercial value (> $8/g at 99+% purity from Airgas{sup R}). Zeolites are nanoporous crystalline aluminosilicate materials with pores that are capable of separating molecules by shape and size. SAPO-34 is a silicoaluminophosphate zeolite with pore size of 0.38 nm. The SAPO-34 is a molecular sieve composed of 3D networks with CHA frame structure containing uniform micropores. Since this pore size is intermediate between the kinetic diameters of krypton (0.36 nm) and xenon (0.396 nm), it was hypothesized that SAPO-34 membranes can separate krypton and xenon by diffusivity differences. Previously we fabricated SAPO-34 membranes and showed that they are capable of separating Kr from Xe. Here we describe a more detailed study of the fundamental adsorption and transport properties of SAPO34. In particular, the permeabilities of Kr and Xe in SAPO-34 are dependent on both their adsorption and diffusion characteristics in the nanoporous zeolite. Typically, nanoporous materials show stronger adsorption of Xe than Kr (due to stronger van der Waals forces) but faster diffusion of Kr (due to smaller kinetic diameter). Therefore the overall membrane selectivity towards Kr will be determined by competition between these two effects. A main objective of this study is to quantify and understand adsorption, diffusion, and permeation in detail and thereby obtain: (1) fundamental parameters useful for design calculations of a Kr/Xe separation membrane process, and (2) an experimental and modeling framework that can provide guidance on the expected limits of performance of SAPO-34 and other zeolite materials.

"Radiological Consequences of Hydrogen Explosions in Vessels and Piping at the WTP","Lanning, Roger D.; Smith, Richard I.","12 MANAGEMENT OF RADIOACTIVE WASTES, AND NON-RADIOACTIVE WASTES FROM NUCLEAR FACILITIES; 54 ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCES; CONTROL; INTERSTITIAL HYDROGEN GENERATION; RADIATION DOSES; RADIOACTIVE AEROSOLS; RADIOACTIVE WASTES; RADIOISOTOPES; RADIOLYSIS; SAFETY; WASTE PROCESSING","Hydrogen (along with other gases) is generated in process vessels and other components at the Hanford Waste Treatment and Immobilization Plant (WTP) due to the radiolysis of water and to the radiolysis and thermolysis of organics in WTP radioactive process wastes. In the absence of controls, the hydrogen may accumulate until a flammable or explosive concentration is reached. Once a buildup has occurred, ignition of the hydrogen causes an explosion that creates radioactive aerosols that could escape the confinement boundary and be released to the environment. Such a release could cause significant radiological exposures to a public receptor at the site boundary and to a co-located worker (CLW/) in the yard areas outside the physical facilities. Hydrogen explosion events therefore require evaluation as to the potential magnitude of their consequences. The WTP methodology for the evaluation of the potential radiological consequences due to hydrogen explosions in vessels and piping is a conservative approach that is defensible from a regulatory standpoint yet only results in the need for Safety controls for the most highly radioactive process vessels (generally those containing waste with significant quantities of solids). For WTP vessels with waste not containing significant quantities of solids, radiological dose consequences are sufficiently low such that neither Safety Class controls for the public receptor nor Safety Significant controls for the CLW are required. Similarly, the dose consequences for hydrogen explosions in piping and ancillary vessels are all very low to both receptors, again indicating that no Safety Class or Safety Significant controls are required. The WTP vessel and piping hydrogen explosion calculations are dependent on vessel and pipe sizes, hydrogen generation rates, operational requirements, and waste stream properties such as solids content, radioisotope concentration, and slurry density. Consequently, the WTP-specific results discussed above cannot be extrapolated directly to other facilities.

There are several disposal methods for radioactive materials such as regulation exemption, decontamination and long-term storage. It is necessary for us to achieve the permanent disposal of radioactive waste. The methods for solidifying radioactive waste include cement solidification, asphalt solidification, and polymer solidification. Cement solidification has several advantages such as well-known materials and technologies, various applications, and reasonable cost. On the contrary, it has certain disadvantages such as a large volume expansion of solidification for radioactive waste. Because cement solidification has excellent structural strength and a shielding effect, it is widely used for the permanent disposal of radioactive waste. Cement solidification operates as a barrier against the leaching of nuclides during radioactive waste disposal. To evaluate the criteria of KORAD (Korea Radioactive Waste Agency), integrity tests on the solidification of radioactive waste need to be performed. In this study, to inspect the criteria of KORAD, we carried out the cement solidification of residual metal oxide from radioactive waste. An integrity inspection such as the pressure strength, inundation, and leaching test on cement solidification was performed. We also analyzed the experimental results according to the criteria of KORAD. The calculation of the leachability index on the primary and secondary cement solidification for leaching detection of nuclides is carried out. The integrity of primary and secondary cement solidification is evaluated.

The current criticality safety evaluation for the facility postulates that a criticality event is possible if the solutions are allowed to concentrate through evaporation, freezing, storing multiple bottles in a geometrically unfavorable array, or any combination of these conditions. Using chemical data on uranyl nitrate freezing from Savannah River National Laboratory, protected limits on concentration and enrichment, and normal operational restrictions, criticality was shown to be incredible under all normal and credible abnormal conditions. A bounding normal solution is analyzed under normal conditions and shown to be substantially subcritical. A bounding credible abnormal solution is defined as 9.2 g U{sup 235}/L and 73 wt. % enriched and 0 M excess nitric acid. The concentration and enrichment are limitations already protected by the facility for other processes. Because acidity is not specifically restricted, the most reactive lower bound is selected. The credible abnormal worst placement is in a concrete basin reflected on three sides. There the bottle(s) would be subject in the worst cases to flooding (full water reflection) and postulated concentration through evaporation or freezing. Computational modeling was performed using KENOVI in the SCALE 6.1 code package.

"Estimation of Inherent Safety Margins in Loaded Commercial Spent Nuclear Fuel Casks","Banerjee, Kaushik; Robb, Kevin R.; Radulescu, Georgeta; Scaglione, John M.","11 NUCLEAR FUEL CYCLE AND FUEL MATERIALS; 12 MANAGEMENT OF RADIOACTIVE AND NON-RADIOACTIVE WASTES FROM NUCLEAR FACILITIES; spent nuclear fuel; uncredited safety margin; as-loaded casks","We completed a novel assessment to determine the unquantified and uncredited safety margins (i.e., the difference between the licensing basis and as-loaded calculations) available in as-loaded spent nuclear fuel (SNF) casks. This assessment was performed as part of a broader effort to assess issues and uncertainties related to the continued safety of casks during extended storage and transportability following extended storage periods. Detailed analyses crediting the actual as-loaded cask inventory were performed for each of the casks at three decommissioned pressurized water reactor (PWR) sites to determine their characteristics relative to regulatory safety criteria for criticality, thermal, and shielding performance. These detailed analyses were performed in an automated fashion by employing a comprehensive and integrated data and analysis tool—Used Nuclear Fuel-Storage, Transportation & Disposal Analysis Resource and Data System (UNF-ST&DARDS). Calculated uncredited criticality margins from 0.07 to almost 0.30 Δk<sub>eff</sub> were observed; calculated decay heat margins ranged from 4 to almost 22 kW (as of 2014); and significant uncredited transportation dose rate margins were also observed. The results demonstrate that, at least for the casks analyzed here, significant uncredited safety margins are available that could potentially be used to compensate for SNF assembly and canister structural performance related uncertainties associated with long-term storage and subsequent transportation. The results also suggest that these inherent margins associated with how casks are loaded could support future changes in cask licensing to directly or indirectly credit the margins. Work continues to quantify the uncredited safety margins in the SNF casks loaded at other nuclear reactor sites.","American Nuclear Society (ANS)","","Oak Ridge National Lab.

One approach is determination of the bacteria which directly respond to uranium addition. In this research, uranium amendments were made to groundwater samples from a site of ongoing biostimulation with acetate. The active microbes in the planktonic phase were deduced by monitoring ribosomes production via RT-PCR. The results indicated several microorganisms were synthesizing ribosomes in proportion with uranium amendment up to 2 μM. Concentrations of U (VI) >2 μM were generally found to inhibit ribosome synthesis. Two active bacteria responding to uranium addition in the field were close relatives of <i>Desulfobacter postgateii</i> and <i>Geobacter bemidjiensis</i>. Since RNA content often increases with growth rate, our findings suggest it is possible to rapidly elucidate active bacteria responding to the addition of uranium in field samples and provides a more targeted approach to stimulate specific populations to enhance radionuclide reduction in contaminated sites.","Public Library of Science","","Argonne National Lab.

The concept of damage-plasticity model was implemented in the SIFEL finite element code and consequently, the code was used for the simulation of the Äspö Pillar Stability Experiment (APSE) which was performed in order to determine yielding strength under various conditions in similar granite rocks as in Czech Republic.

This work provides evidence that Gd<sub>2</sub>Zr<sub>2</sub>O<sub>7</sub>, often considered the most radiation tolerant pyrochlore, could be susceptible to radiation damage in the form of bubble nucleation at the highest He doses expected over geological time. Ion irradiations were utilized to experimentally simulate the radiation damage and He accumulation produced by α-decay.

These samples were then implanted to various He concentrations in order to study the long-term effects of He accumulation. Helium bubbles 1–3 nm in diameter were observed in TEM at a concentration of 4.6 at.% He. Some bubbles remained isolated, while others formed chains 10–30 nm in length parallel to the surface. GIXRD measurements showed lattice swelling after irradiating pristine Gd<sub>2</sub>Zr<sub>2</sub>O<sub>7</sub> with 7 MeV Au<sup>3+</sup> to a fluence of 2.2 × 10<sup>15</sup> Au/cm<sup>2</sup>.

APT can provide three-dimensional Li and B imaging with very high spatial resolution (≤ 2 nm). In addition, absolute quantification of Li and B is possible, though room remains to improve accuracy. However, the major drawbacks of APT include limited field of view (normally ≤ 100 × 100 × 500 nm<sup>3</sup>) and poor sample compatibility. As a comparison, ToF-SIMS and NanoSIMS are sample-friendly with flexible field of view (up to 500 × 500 μm<sup>2</sup> and image stitching is feasible); however, lateral resolution is limited to only about 100 nm.

However, the stable numerical modeling of ground ruptures is still an open issue. The present work introduces a novel formulation based on the use of the Lagrange multipliers to prescribe the constraints on the contact surfaces. The variational formulation is modified in order to take into account the frictional work along the activated fault portion according to the principle of maximum plastic dissipation. The numerical model, developed in the framework of the Finite Element method, provides stable solutions with a fast convergence of the non-linear problem. The stabilizing properties of the proposed model are emphasized with the aid of a realistic numerical example dealing with the generation of ground fractures due to groundwater withdrawal in arid regions. - Highlights: • A numerical model is developed for the simulation of fault and fracture mechanics. • The model is implemented in the framework of the Finite Element method and with the aid of Lagrange multipliers. • The proposed formulation introduces a new contribution due to the frictional work on the portion of activated fault. • The resulting algorithm is highly non-linear as the portion of activated fault is itself unknown. • The numerical solution is validated against analytical results and proves to be stable also in realistic applications.","","Available from http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jcp.2016.03.032","","","","United States","2016-06-01T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: Journal of Computational Physics; Journal Volume: 314; Other Information: Copyright (c) 2016 Elsevier Science B.V., Amsterdam, The Netherlands, All rights reserved.; Country of input: International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA)","","Medium: X; Size: page(s) 503-521","","","","Journal ID: ISSN 0021-9991; CODEN: JCTPAH; PII: S0021-9991(16)00184-4; TRN: US16R3568016559","10.1016/J.JCP.2016.03.032","","2017-03-14T00:00:00Z","22572311","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/22572311","","Journal of Computational Physics","","314"
"On the impact of temperatures up to 200°C in clay repositories with bentonite engineer barrier systems: A study with coupled thermal, hydrological, chemical, and mechanical modeling","Zheng, Liange; Rutqvist, Jonny; Birkholzer, Jens T.; Liu, Hui-Hai","58 GEOSCIENCES; 12 MANAGEMENT OF RADIOACTIVE AND NON-RADIOACTIVE WASTES FROM NUCLEAR FACILITIES; nuclear waste disposal; clay; bentonite; THMC; modeling; high temperature","One of the most important design variables for a geological nuclear waste repository is the temperature limit up to which the engineered barrier system (EBS) and the natural geologic environment can be exposed. Up to now, almost all design concepts that involve bentonite-backfilled emplacement tunnels have chosen a maximum allowable temperature of about 100°C. Such a choice is largely based on the consideration that in clay-based materials illitization and the associated mechanical changes in the bentonite (and perhaps the clay host rock) could affect the barrier attributes of the EBS. However, existing experimental and modeling studies on the occurrence of illitization and related performance impacts are not conclusive, in part because the relevant couplings between the thermal, hydrological, chemical, and mechanical (THMC) processes have not been fully represented in the models. This work presents a fully coupled THMC simulation of a nuclear waste repository in a clay formation with a bentonite-backfilled EBS for 1000 years. Two scenarios were simulated for comparison: a case in which the temperature in the bentonite near the waste canister can reach about 200°C and a case in which the temperature in the bentonite near the waste canister peaks at about 100°C. The model simulations demonstrate some degree of illitization in both the bentonite buffer and the surrounding clay formation. Other chemical alterations include the dissolution of K-feldspar and calcite, and precipitation of quartz, chlorite, and kaolinite. In general, illitization in the bentonite and the clay formation is enhanced at higher temperature. However, the quantity of illitization is affected by many chemical factors and therefore varies a great deal. The most important chemical factors are the concentration of K in the pore water as well as the abundance and dissolution rate of K-feldspar; less important ones are the concentration of sodium and the quartz precipitation rate. In our modeling scenarios, the calculated decrease in smectite volume fraction in bentonite ranges from 1 to 8% of the initial volume fraction of smectite in the 100°C scenario and 1–27% in the 200°C scenario. Chemical changes in the 200°C scenario could also lead to a reduction in swelling stress up to 15–18% whereas those in the 100°C scenario result in about 14–15% reduction in swelling stress for the base case scenario. Model results also show that the 200°C scenario results in a much higher total stress than the 100°C scenario, mostly due to thermal pressurization. While cautions should be taken regarding the model results due to some limitations in the models, the modeling work is illustrative in light of the relative importance of different processes occurring in EBS bentonite and clay formation at higher than 100°C conditions, and could be of greater use when site specific data are available.","Elsevier","","Lawrence Berkeley National Lab.

"An improved thermodynamic model for the complexation of trivalent actinides and lanthanide with oxalic acid valid to high ionic strength.","Xiong, Yongliang; Thakur, Punam; Borkowski, Marian","38 RADIATION CHEMISTRY, RADIOCHEMISTRY, AND NUCLEAR CHEMISTRY; 12 MANAGEMENT OF RADIOACTIVE AND NON-RADIOACTIVE WASTES FROM NUCLEAR FACILITIES; oxalic acid dissociation constants; Am–Cm–Eu–oxalic acid complexation; Pitzer parameters; extraction; high ionic strength","The dissociation constants of oxalic acid (Ox), and the stability constants of Am<sup>3+</sup>, Cm<sup>3+</sup> and Eu<sup>3+</sup> with Ox<sup>2–</sup> have been determined at 25 °C, over a range of concentration varying from 0.1 to 6.60 m NaClO4 using potentiometric titration and extraction techniques, respectively. The experimental data support the formation of complexes, M(Ox)<sub>n</sub><sup>3 – 2n</sup>, where (M = Am<sup>3+</sup>, Cm<sup>3+</sup> and Eu<sup>3+</sup> and n = 1 and 2). The dissociation constant and the stability constant values measured as a function of NaClO<sub>4</sub> concentration were used to estimate the Pitzer parameters for the respective interactions of Am<sup>3+</sup>, Cm<sup>3+</sup> and Eu<sup>3+</sup> with Ox. Furthermore, the stability constants data of Am<sup>3+</sup> –Ox measured in NaClO<sub>4</sub> and in NaCl solutions from the literature were simultaneously fitted in order to refine the existing actinide–oxalate complexation model that can be used universally in the safety assessment of radioactive waste disposal. The thermodynamic stability constant: log β<sup>0</sup><sub>101</sub> = 6.30 ± 0.06 and log β<sup>0</sup><sub>102</sub> = 10.84 ± 0.06 for Am<sup>3+</sup> was obtained by simultaneously fitting data in NaCl and NaClO<sub>4</sub> media. Additionally, log β<sup>0</sup><sub>101</sub> = 6.72 ± 0.08 and log β<sup>0</sup><sub>102</sub> = 11.05 ± 0.09 for the Cm<sup>3+</sup> and log β<sup>0</sup><sub>101</sub> = 6.67 ± 0.08 and log β<sup>0</sup><sub>102</sub> = 11.15 ± 0.09 for the Eu<sup>3+</sup> were calculated by extrapolation of data to zero ionic strength in NaClO<sub>4</sub> medium only. For all stability constants, the Pitzer model gives an excellent representation of the data using interaction parameters β<sup>(0)</sup>, β<sup>(1)</sup>, and CΦ determined in this work. The thermodynamic model developed in this work will be useful in accurately modeling the potential solubility of trivalent actinides and early lanthanides to ionic strength of 6.60 m in low temperature environments in the presence of Ox. Furthermore, the work is also applicable to the accurate modeling transport of rare earth elements in various environments under the surface conditions.","Elsevier","","Sandia National Lab.

Two of the GCLs (CS and GS) contained conventional sodium bentonite (Na-B). The others contained a bentonite–polymer mixture (CPL, CPH, GPL1, GPL2, and GPH) or bentonite–polymer composite (BPC). All GCLs (except GPL2 and GPH) were permeated directly with two synthetic LLW leachates that are essentially identical, except one has no radionuclides (nonradioactive synthetic leachate, or NSL) and the other has radionuclides (radioactive synthetic leachate, or RSL). Hydraulic conductivities to RSL and NSL were identical. For the CS and GS GCLs, the hydraulic conductivity gradually increased by a factor of 5–25 because divalent cations in the leachate replaced native sodium cations bound to the bentonite. The CPL, GPL1, and GPL2 GCLs with low polymer loading (1.2–3.3%) had hydraulic conductivities similar to the conventional GCLs. In contrast, hydraulic conductivity of the CPH, GPH, and BPC GCLs with high polymer loading (≥5%) to RSL or NSL was comparable to, or lower than, the hydraulic conductivity to deionized water. Permeation with leachate reduced the swell index of the bentonite in all of the GCLs. A conceptual model featuring pore blocking by polymer hydrogel is proposed to explain why the hydraulic conductivity of bentonite–polymer GCLs to LLW leachates remains low even though the leachate inhibits bentonite swelling.","American Society of Civil Engineers","","Vanderbilt Univ., Nashville, TN (United States)","USDOE","","United States","2016-04-25T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: Journal of Geotechnical and Geoenvironmental Engineering; Journal Volume: 142; Journal Issue: 8","","Medium: ED; Size: Article No. 04016037","","","FC01-06EW07053","Journal ID: ISSN 1090-0241","10.1061/(ASCE)GT.1943-5606.0001495","","2018-05-30T00:00:00Z","1438179","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/1438179","https://www.osti.gov/servlets/purl/1438179","Journal of Geotechnical and Geoenvironmental Engineering","8","142"

The feed is charged to the melter on the top of the molten glass, where it forms a layer of reacting and melting material, called the cold cap. During the final stages of the batch-to-glass conversion process, gases evolved from reactions produce primary foam, the growth and collapse of which controls the glass production rate. The mathematical model of the cold cap was revised to include functional representation of primary foam behavior and to account for the dry cold cap surface. The melting rate is computed as a response to the dependence of the primary foam collapse temperature on the heating rate and melter operating conditions, including the effect of bubbling on the cold cap bottom and top surface temperatures. The simulation results are in good agreement with experimental data from laboratory-scale and pilot-scale melter studies. Lastly, the cold cap model will become part of the full three-dimensional mathematical model of the waste glass melter.","American Ceramic Society","","Idaho National Lab.

We report an experimental and reactive transport modeling examination of americium transport in a groundwater–bentonite–fracture fill material system. A series of batch sorption and column transport experiments were conducted to determine the role of desorption kinetics from bentonite colloids in the transport of americium through fracture materials. We used fracture fill material from a shear zone in altered granodiorite collected from the Grimsel Test Site (GTS) in Switzerland and colloidal suspensions generated from FEBEX bentonite, a potential repository backfill material. The colloidal suspension (100 mg L<sup>–1</sup>) was prepared in synthetic groundwater that matched the natural water chemistry at GTS and was spiked with 5.5 × 10<sup>–10</sup> M<sup>241</sup>Am. Batch characterizations indicated that 97% of the americium in the stock suspension was adsorbed to the colloids. Breakthrough experiments conducted by injecting the americium colloidal suspension through three identical columns in series, each with mean residence times of 6 h, show that more than 95% of the bentonite colloids were transported through each of the columns, with modeled colloid filtration rates (k<sub>f</sub>) of 0.01–0.02 h<sup>–1</sup>. Am recoveries in each column were 55–60%, and Am desorption rate constants from the colloids, determined from 1-D transport modeling, were 0.96, 0.98, and 0.91 h<sup>–1</sup> in the three columns, respectively. The consistency in Am recoveries and desorption rate constants in each column indicates that the Am was not associated with binding sites of widely-varying strengths on the colloids, as one binding site with fast kinetics represented the system accurately for all three sequential columns. As a result, our data suggest that colloid-mediated transport of Am in a bentonite-fracture fill material system is unlikely to result in transport over long distance scales because of the ability of the fracture materials to rapidly strip Am from the bentonite colloids and the apparent lack of a strong binding site that would keep a fraction of the Am strongly-associated with the colloids.","Elsevier","","Los Alamos National Lab.

In this context, the economic feasibility of plasma mass filtering for nuclear waste pretreatment before ultimate disposal is analyzed. Results indicate similar costs for chemical and plasma solid-waste pretreatment per unit mass of waste, but suggest significant savings potential as a result of a superior waste mass minimization. This performance improvement is observed over a large range of waste chemical compositions, representative of legacy waste's heterogeneity. Although smaller, additional savings arise from the absence of a secondary liquid waste stream, as typically produced by chemical techniques.","Elsevier","","Princeton Plasma Physics Lab.

Several key bacteria believed to be involved in radionuclide containment have been described; however, most of the evidence implicating uranium reduction with specific microbiota has been indirect. Here, we report on the cultivation of a microorganism from the Rifle IFRC that reduces uranium and appears to utilize it as a terminal electron acceptor for respiration with acetate as electron donor. Furthermore, this bacterium constitutes a significant proportion of the subsurface sediment community prior to biostimulation based on TRFLP profiling of 16S rRNA genes. 16S rRNA gene sequence analysis indicates that the microorganism is a betaproteobacterium with a high similarity to <i>Burkholderia fungorum</i>.

Both experimental and model results show that as the duration of the wet curing is increased, the member peak deflection also increases from one sided drying. Experiments suggest that the extended wet curing causes a pore structure refinement resulting in greater saturation and consequently greater shrinkage. A simplified 1-D, drying diffusion and shrinkage model is able to adequately predict experimentally measured peak curling deflections, and confirms the effect of saturation on curling. The results provide important insight into the volume stability of slabs and the potential negative impact of wet curing on slab curling.","","Available from http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.cemconres.2015.09.007","","","","United States","2016-01-15T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: Cement and Concrete Research; Journal Volume: 79; Other Information: Copyright (c) 2015 Elsevier Science B.V., Amsterdam, The Netherlands, All rights reserved.; Country of input: International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA)","","Medium: X; Size: page(s) 151-158","","","","Journal ID: ISSN 0008-8846; CODEN: CCNRAI; PII: S0008-8846(15)00244-6; TRN: US16R3253046226","10.1016/J.CEMCONRES.2015.09.007","","2018-06-29T00:00:00Z","22696538","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/22696538","","Cement and Concrete Research","","79"

At the Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory (LLNL), a Canberra WM2200 Segmented Gamma Scanner (SGS) (identified at LLNL as WS1331) was purchased to measure moderate to high levels of special nuclear materials (SNM) in Transuranic (TRU) waste drums generated at the Superblock (SBK) facility. As a result of changes in mission and in waste processing and packaging procedures, the majority of the waste items generated at SBK now only contain moderate to low levels of SNM. Modifications were needed to WS1331 to meet the measurement needs for the lower activity items. An additional Canberra LYNX Digital Signal Processor (DSP) was added to the nuclear instrumentation of WS1331 so optimized spectra could be acquired for both the quantitative activity and isotopic results. After the system was enhanced, measurements were collected to evaluate and assess the impact of the change on results. As a result, the measurement tests indicate that the additional DSP improved the performance of WS1331 for lower activity TRU waste drums.","See Research Organization","","Lawrence Livermore National Lab.

Currently there are very few options available to treat I-129 in the groundwater, which is partially related to its complex biogeochemical behavior in the subsurface and occurrence in the multiple chemical forms. We hypothesize that layered hydrotalcite materials containing redox active transition metal ions offer a potential solution, benefiting from the simultaneous adsorption of iodate (IO3-) and iodide (I-) anions, which exhibit different electronic and structural properties and therefore may require dissimilar hosts. To test this hypothesis, Cr3+- based materials were selected based on the rationale that Cr3+ readily reduces IO3- in solution. It was combined with either redox-active Co2+ or redox-inactive Ni2+ so that two model materials were prepared by hydrothermal synthesis including Co2+-Cr3+ and Ni2+-Cr3+(M-Cr). Obtained M-Cr materials comprised of Co2+-Cr3+ or Ni2+-Cr3+ layered hydrotalcite and small fractions of Co3O4 spinel or Ni(OH)2 theophrastite phases were structurally characterized before and after uptake of periodate (IO4-), IO3-, and I- anions. It was found that the IO3- uptake is driven by its chemical reduction to I2 and I-. Interestingly, in the Co2+-Cr3+ hydrotalcite, Co2+ and not Cr3+ serves as a reductant while in the Ni2+-Cr3+ hydrotalcite Cr3+ is responsible for the reduction of IO3-. A different uptake mechanism was identified for the IO4- anion. The Co2+-Cr3+ hydrotalcite phase efficiently uptakes IO4- by a diffusion-limited ion exchange mechanism and is not accompanied by the redox process, while Cr3+ in the Ni2+-Cr3+ hydrotalcite reduces IO4- to IO3-, I2 and I-. Iodide exhibited high affinity only to the Co-Cr material. The Co-Cr material performed remarkably well for the removal of IO3-, I- and total iodine from the groundwater collected from the US DOE Hanford site, WA, USA outperforming non-redox active hydrotalcites (e.g., Mg2+-Al3+) reported previously. This work demonstrates that redox-controlled sorption can be a highly effective method for the treatment of anions based on elements with mobile oxidation states. Further, multiple anions of interest could be simultaneously removed through combination of approaches.","Royal Society of Chemistry","","Pacific Northwest National Lab.

Smith and Thorne argue that current biokinetic models of the International Commission on Radiological Protection (ICRP) for carbon and chlorine are overly cautious models from the standpoint of radiation dose estimates for C-14 and Cl-36, and that more realistic models are needed for evaluation of the hazards of these radionuclides in nuclear wastes. We (Harrison and Leggett) point out that new biokinetic models for these and other elements (developed at ORNL) will soon appear in ICRP Publications. These new models generally are considerably more realistic than current ICRP models.

To demonstrate the ability of this framework silicate mineral to encapsulate and immobilize <sup>99</sup>Tc and <sup>129</sup>I, single-pass flow-through (SPFT) tests were conducted on a sodalite-bearing multi-phase ceramic waste form produced through a steam reforming process. We produced two samples made using a steam reformer samples using nonradioactive I and Re (as a surrogate for Tc), while a third sample was produced using actual radioactive tank waste containing Tc and added Re. One of the non-radioactive samples was produced with an engineering-scale steam reformer while the other non-radioactive sample and the radioactive sample were produced using a bench-scale steam reformer. For all three steam reformer products, the similar steady-state dilute-solution release rates for Re, I, and Tc at pH (25 C) 9 and 40 C were measured. However, it was found that the Re, I, and Tc releases were equal or up to 4.5x higher compared to the release rates of the network-forming elements, Na, Al, and Si. Moreover, the similar releases of Re and Tc in the SPFT test, and the similar time-dependent shapes of the release curves for samples containing I, suggest that Re, Tc, and I partition to the sodalite minerals during the steam reforming process.","Elsevier","","Oak Ridge National Lab.

"Effects of aqueous uranyl speciation on the kinetics of microbial uranium reduction","Belli, Keaton M.; DiChristina, Thomas J.; Van Cappellen, Philippe; Taillefert, Martial","54 ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCES; 58 GEOSCIENCES; 12 MANAGEMENT OF RADIOACTIVE AND NON-RADIOACTIVE WASTES FROM NUCLEAR FACILITIES; Uranium bioreduction; uranium bioavailability; uranium speciation; uranium toxicity; uranium bioremediation","The ability to predict the success of the microbial reduction of soluble U(VI) to highly insoluble U(IV) as an in situ bioremediation strategy is complicated by the wide range of geochemical conditions at contaminated sites and the strong influence of aqueous uranyl speciation on the bioavailability and toxicity of U(VI) to metal-reducing bacteria. In order to determine the effects of aqueous uranyl speciation on uranium bioreduction kinetics, incubations and viability assays with Shewanella putrefaciens strain 200 were conducted over a range of pH and dissolved inorganic carbon (DIC), Ca<sup>2+</sup>, and Mg<sup>2+</sup> concentrations. A speciation-dependent kinetic model was developed to reproduce the observed time series of total dissolved uranium concentration over the range of geochemical conditions tested. The kinetic model yielded the highest rate constant for the reduction of uranyl non-carbonate species (i.e., the ‘free’ hydrated uranyl ion, uranyl hydroxides, and other minor uranyl complexes), indicating that they represent the most readily reducible fraction of U(VI) despite being the least abundant uranyl species in solution. In the presence of DIC, Ca<sup>2+</sup>, and Mg<sup>2+</sup> is suppressed during the formation of more bioavailable uranyl non-carbonate species and resulted in slower bioreduction rates. At high concentrations of bioavailable U(VI), however, uranium toxicity to S. putrefaciens inhibited bioreduction, and viability assays confirmed that the concentration of non-carbonate uranyl species best predicts the degree of toxicity. The effect of uranium toxicity was accounted for by incorporating the free ion activity model of metal toxicity into the bioreduction rate law. These results demonstrate that, in the absence of competing terminal electron acceptors, uranium bioreduction kinetics can be predicted over a wide range of geochemical conditions based on the bioavailability and toxicity imparted on U(VI) by solution composition. Finally, these findings also imply that the concentration of uranyl non-carbonate species, despite being extremely low, is a determining factor controlling uranium bioreduction at contaminated sites.","The Geochemical Society; The Meteoritical Society","","Georgia Institute of Technology, Atlanta, GA (United States)","USDOE Office of Science (SC), Biological and Environmental Research (BER)","","United States","2015-02-16T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: Geochimica et Cosmochimica Acta; Journal Volume: 157; Journal Issue: C","","Medium: ED; Size: p. 109-124","","","SC0005520","Journal ID: ISSN 0016-7037; PII: S0016703715000794","10.1016/j.gca.2015.02.006","","2021-07-21T00:00:00Z","1332077","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/1332077","https://www.osti.gov/servlets/purl/1332077","Geochimica et Cosmochimica Acta","C","157"

Inherent forward rates of glass dissolution were determined over a temperature range of 23 to 70°C and an alkaline pH range of 8.0 to 12.0. Linear regression techniques were applied to the TST kinetic rate law to obtain fundamental parameters necessary to model the dissolution kinetics of UK high-level waste glass (the activation energy (Ea), pH power law coefficient (η) and the intrinsic rate constant (k0)), which is of importance to the post-closure safety case for the geological disposal of vitreous products. The activation energies based on B release ranged from 55 ± 3 to 83 ± 9 kJ mol–1, indicating that Magnox–THORP blend glass dissolution has a surface-controlled mechanism, similar to that of other high- level waste simulant glass compositions such as the French SON68 and LAW in the US. Forward dissolution rates, based on Si, B and Na release, suggested that the dissolution mechanism under dilute conditions, and pH and temperature ranges of this study, was not sensitive to composition as defined by HLW-incorporation rate.","Mineralogical Society","","Pacific Northwest National Lab.

The survey included radiation scans to identify contamination and, if identified, define the boundary and magnitude of contamination. Fixed-point 1-minute measurements were also collected at randomly selected locations for comparison against the site's free release limit of 5,000 disintegrations per minute per 100 cm² (dpm/100 cm²) (0.83 Bq/cm²). Scan data were recorded using a data logger as a means to document surveyor observation - logged data captured at 1-second intervals and converted to counts per minute (cpm) by the data logger software were presented in the project report. Both the qualitative scan data (in cpm) and the quantitative direct measurement (in dpm/100 cm²) were reported for completeness, so stakeholders had all available information to support disposition decisions. However, a new stakeholder - introduced to the project at the reporting phase of work - used the instrument efficiency and background data to convert the scan data from cpm to dpm/100 cm², then compared the converted results to the site limit. Many of the converted values exceeded 5,000 dpm/100 cm². This resulted in delays in tank disposition and additional project costs which could have been avoided if the proper use and interpretation of scan data, and implications of radon progeny buildup on oxidized metal surfaces, had been better communicated.","Health Physics Society","","Oak Ridge Associated Universities, Oak Ridge, TN (United States)","USDOE Office of Environmental Management (EM)","","United States","2015-11-01T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: Health Physics; Journal Volume: 109; Journal Issue: 3, Suppl. 3","","Medium: ED; Size: p.

The preferred objects are reusable items and wastes within the categories bulky waste, WEEE and metals, intended to be sold on flea markets. Despite leading to a loss of recyclable resources for Austrian waste management, these informal activities may contribute to the extension of the lifetime of certain goods when they are reused in Hungary; nevertheless they are discussed rather controversially. The aim of this paper is to provide objective data on the quantities informally collected and transhipped. The unique activities of informal collectors required the development and implementation of a new set of methodologies. The concept of triangulation was used to verify results obtained by field visits, interviews and a traffic counting campaign. Both approaches lead to an estimation of approx. 100,000 t per year of reusable items informally collected in Austria. This means that in addition to the approx. 72 kg/cap/yr formally collected bulky waste, bulky waste wood, household scrap (excluding packaging) and WEEE, up to a further 12 kg/cap/yr might, in the case that informal collection is abandoned, end up as waste or in the second-hand sector.","","Available from http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.wasman.2015.07.015","","","","United States","2015-10-15T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: Waste Management; Journal Volume: 44; Other Information: Copyright (c) 2015 Elsevier Science B.V., Amsterdam, The Netherlands, All rights reserved.; Country of input: International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA)","","Medium: X; Size: page(s) 3-14","","","","Journal ID: ISSN 0956-053X; CODEN: WAMAE2; PII: S0956-053X(15)30032-5; TRN: US16R2264042369","10.1016/J.WASMAN.2015.07.015","","2016-05-09T00:00:00Z","22472555","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/22472555","","Waste Management","","44"

Such areas are under-represented in published research. The study examined source segregation, potential participation in a food waste segregation scheme, and food waste prevention activities in five estates (1034 households). The results showed that: contamination of recyclables containers was low; ca. 28% of the mixed residual waste’s weight was recyclable; food waste comprised a small proportion of the waste from these residents, probably because of their relatively disadvantaged economic circumstances; and the recycling profile reflected an intermittent pattern of behaviour. Although the majority of respondents reported that they would participate in a food waste separation scheme, the response rate was low and many responses of “don’t know” were recorded. Municipalities committed to foster improved diversion from landfill need to recognise that there is no “quick and easy fix”, regardless of local or national aspirations. Lasting and sustained behaviour change requires time and the quality of service provision and associated infrastructure play a fundamental role in facilitating residents to participate effectively in waste management activities that maximise capture of source-segregated materials. Populations in deprived areas that reside in high-rise, high-density dwellings are “hard-to-reach” in terms of participation in recycling schemes and exceptional efforts and additional resources are usually required to improve performance.","","Available from http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.wasman.2015.04.010","","","","United States","2015-10-15T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: Waste Management; Journal Volume: 44; Other Information: Copyright (c) 2015 Elsevier Science B.V., Amsterdam, The Netherlands, All rights reserved.; Country of input: International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA)","","Medium: X; Size: page(s) 15-27","","","","Journal ID: ISSN 0956-053X; CODEN: WAMAE2; PII: S0956-053X(15)00282-2; TRN: US16R2265042370","10.1016/J.WASMAN.2015.04.010","","2016-05-09T00:00:00Z","22472556","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/22472556","","Waste Management","","44"

However, detailed measurements of temperature and gas species inside a furnace are difficulty by conventional experimental techniques. Therefore, numerical simulation of MSW incineration in the packed bed and gas flow field was applied. In this work, a three dimensional (3-D) model of incinerator system, including flow, heat transfer, detailed chemical mechanisms, and non-gray gas models, was developed. Radiation from the furnace wall and the flame formed above the bed is of importance for drying and igniting the waste. The preheated air with high temperature is used for the MSW combustion. Under the conditions of high temperature and high pressure, MSW combustion produces a variety of radiating gases. The wavelength-depend radiative properties of flame adopted in non-gray radiation model were obtained from a statistical narrow-band model. The influence of radiative heat transfer on temperature, flow field is researched by adiabatic model (without considering radiation), gray radiation model, and non-gray radiation model. The simulation results show that taking into account the non-gray radiation is essential.","","Available from http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.wasman.2015.07.025","","","","United States","2015-10-15T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: Waste Management; Journal Volume: 44; Other Information: Copyright (c) 2015 Elsevier Science B.V., Amsterdam, The Netherlands, All rights reserved.; Country of input: International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA)","","Medium: X; Size: page(s) 116-124","","","","Journal ID: ISSN 0956-053X; CODEN: WAMAE2; PII: S0956-053X(15)30042-8; TRN: US16R2267042372","10.1016/J.WASMAN.2015.07.025","","2016-05-09T00:00:00Z","22472558","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/22472558","","Waste Management","","44"

The process presents several advantages allowing to perform a significant volume and moisture reduction of the produced waste at domestic scale thus producing a material with an increased storability and improved characteristics (e.g. calorific value) that make it available for further alternative uses. The assessment of the applicability of the proposed waste pretreatment in a new scheme of waste management system requires several research steps involving different competences and application scales. In this context, a preliminary study is needed targeting to the evaluation and minimization of the energy consumption associated to the process. To this aim, in the present paper, two configurations of a domestic appliance prototype have been presented and the effect of some operating variables has been investigated in order to select the proper configuration and the best set of operating conditions capable to minimize the duration and the energy consumption of the process. The performances of the prototype have been also tested on three model mixtures representing a possible daily domestic waste and compared with an existing commercially available appliance. The results obtained show that a daily application of the process is feasible given the short treatment time required and the energy consumption comparable to the one of the common domestic appliances. Finally, the evaluation of the energy recovered in the final product per unit weight of raw material shows that in most cases it is comparable to the energy required from the treatment.","","Available from http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.wasman.2015.07.026","","","","United States","2015-10-15T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: Waste Management; Journal Volume: 44; Other Information: Copyright (c) 2015 Elsevier Science B.V., Amsterdam, The Netherlands, All rights reserved.; Country of input: International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA)","","Medium: X; Size: page(s) 125-134","","","","Journal ID: ISSN 0956-053X; CODEN: WAMAE2; PII: S0956-053X(15)30043-X; TRN: US16R2268042373","10.1016/J.WASMAN.2015.07.026","","2016-05-09T00:00:00Z","22472559","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/22472559","","Waste Management","","44"
"Gas breakthrough and emission through unsaturated compacted clay in landfill final cover","Ng, C. W.W.; Chen, Z. K.; Coo, J.

The gas breakthrough pressure has been widely studied for saturated swelling clay buffer commonly used in high-level radioactive waste disposal facility where the generated gas pressure is very high (in the order of MPa). However, compacted clay in landfill cover is usually unsaturated and the generated landfill gas pressure is normally low (typically less than 10 kPa). Furthermore, effects of clay thickness and degree of saturation on gas breakthrough and emission rate in the context of unsaturated landfill cover has not been quantitatively investigated in previous studies. The feasibility of using unsaturated compacted clay as gas barrier in landfill covers is thus worthwhile to be explored over a wide range of landfill gas pressures under various degrees of saturation and clay thicknesses. In this study, to evaluate the effectiveness of unsaturated compacted clay to minimize gas emission, one-dimensional soil column tests were carried out on unsaturated compacted clay to determine gas breakthrough pressures at ultimate limit state (high pressure range) and gas emission rates at serviceability limit state (low pressure range). Various degrees of saturation and thicknesses of unsaturated clay sample were considered. Moreover, numerical simulations were carried out using a coupled gas–water flow finite element program (CODE-BRIGHT) to better understand the experimental results by extending the clay thickness and varying the degree of saturation to a broader range that is typical at different climate conditions. The results of experimental study and numerical simulation reveal that as the degree of saturation and thickness of clay increase, the gas breakthrough pressure increases but the gas emission rate decreases significantly. Under a gas pressure of 10 kPa (the upper bound limit of typical landfill gas pressure), a 0.6 m or thicker compacted clay is able to prevent gas breakthrough at degree of saturation of 60% or above (in humid regions). Furthermore, to meet the limit of gas emission rate set by the Australian guideline, a 0.6 m-thick clay layer may be sufficient even at low degree of saturation (i.e., 10% like in arid regions)","","Available from http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.wasman.2015.06.042","","","","United States","2015-10-15T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: Waste Management; Journal Volume: 44; Other Information: Copyright (c) 2015 Elsevier Science B.V., Amsterdam, The Netherlands, All rights reserved.; Country of input: International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA)","","Medium: X; Size: page(s) 155-163","","","","Journal ID: ISSN 0956-053X; CODEN: WAMAE2; PII: S0956-053X(15)30014-3; TRN: US16R2269042374","10.1016/J.WASMAN.2015.06.042","","2016-05-09T00:00:00Z","22472560","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/22472560","","Waste Management","","44"
"Recovery of essential nutrients from municipal solid waste – Impact of waste management infrastructure and governance aspects","Zabaleta, Imanol; Rodic, Ljiljana","54 ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCES; 12 MANAGEMENT OF RADIOACTIVE WASTES, AND NON-RADIOACTIVE WASTES FROM NUCLEAR FACILITIES; BENCHMARKS; COVERINGS; EUROPE; FERTILIZERS; LEGISLATION; MATERIALS RECOVERY; NITROGEN; PHOSPHORUS; SANITARY LANDFILLS; SOLID WASTES; URBAN AREAS","Every year 120–140 million tonnes of bio-waste are generated in Europe, most of which is landfilled, incinerated or stabilized and used as covering material in landfill operation. None of these practices enables the recovery of essential nutrients such as phosphorus (P) and nitrogen (N), which are in great demand for agricultural production. Recovery of these nutrients is a matter of international concern considering the non-renewable nature of P sources and the energy intensive production process required for the synthesis of N fertilizers. The objective of this research is to understand the relation between the municipal solid waste management (MSWM) system, both its the physical components and governance aspects, and the recovery of nutrients in Vitoria-Gasteiz (Basque Country) as a benchmark for European medium-size cities. The analysis shows that the existing physical infrastructure and facilities for bio-waste have high potential for nutrient recovery, 49% for N and 83% for P contained in bio-waste. However, governance aspects of the MSWM system such as legislation and user inclusivity play an important role and decrease the actual nutrient recovery to 3.4% and 7.4% for N and P respectively.","","Available from http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.wasman.2015.07.033","","","","United States","2015-10-15T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: Waste Management; Journal Volume: 44; Other Information: Copyright (c) 2015 Elsevier Science B.V., Amsterdam, The Netherlands, All rights reserved.; Country of input: International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA)","","Medium: X; Size: page(s) 178-187","","","","Journal ID: ISSN 0956-053X; CODEN: WAMAE2; PII: S0956-053X(15)30049-0; TRN: US16R2270042375","10.1016/J.WASMAN.2015.07.033","","2016-05-09T00:00:00Z","22472561","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/22472561","","Waste Management","","44"

Adopting PAYT charging models increases the complexity level of the waste management service as new organizational issues have to be evaluated compared to flat charging models. In addition, innovative technological solutions could also be adopted to increase the overall efficiency of the service. Unit pricing, user identification and waste measurement represent the three most important processes to be defined in a PAYT system.

The functional unit was management of 1 Mg mineral, source separated C&DW, which is either utilised in road construction as a substitute for natural aggregates, or landfilled. The assessed environmental impacts included both non-toxic and toxic impact categories. The scenarios comprised all stages of the end-of-life management of C&DW, until final disposal of all residues. Leaching of inorganic contaminants was included, as was the production of natural aggregates, which was avoided because of the use of C&DW. Typical uncertainties related to contaminant leaching were addressed. For most impact categories, utilisation of C&DW in road construction was preferable to landfilling; however, for most categories, utilisation resulted in net environmental burdens. Transportation represented the most important contribution for most nontoxic impacts, accounting for 60–95 per cent of these impacts. Capital goods contributed with negligible impacts. Leaching played a critical role for the toxic categories, where landfilling had lower impacts than utilisation because of the lower levels of leachate per ton of C&DW reaching the groundwater over a 100-year perspective. Leaching of oxyanions (As, V and Sb) was critical with respect to leaching. Typical experimental uncertainties in leaching data did not have a pivotal influence on the results; however, accounting for Cr immobilisation in soils as part of the impact assessment was critical for modelling the leaching impacts. Compared with the overall life cycle of building and construction materials, leaching emissions were shown to be potentially significant for toxicity impacts, compared with contributions from production of the same materials, showing that end-of-life impacts and leaching should not be disregarded when assessing environmental impacts from construction products and materials. CO{sub 2} uptake in the C&DW corresponding to 15 per cent carbonation could out-balance global warming impacts from transportation; however, carbonation would also likely result in increased toxicity impacts due to higher leaching of oxyanions.","","Available from http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.wasman.2015.07.011","","","","United States","2015-10-15T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: Waste Management; Journal Volume: 44; Other Information: Copyright (c) 2015 Elsevier Science B.V., Amsterdam, The Netherlands, All rights reserved.; Country of input: International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA)","","Medium: X; Size: page(s) 196-205","","","","Journal ID: ISSN 0956-053X; CODEN: WAMAE2; PII: S0956-053X(15)30028-3; TRN: US16R2272042377","10.1016/J.WASMAN.2015.07.011","","2016-05-09T00:00:00Z","22472563","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/22472563","","Waste Management","","44"

The role of adsorption and desorption kinetics was evaluated with reactive transport modeling by comparing one-, two-, and three-site models. Emphasis was placed on describing long desorption tails that are important for upscaling in time and distance. The effect of increasing pH in injection solutions was also evaluated. For pH 6.9, a three-site model with forward rate constants between 0.07 and 0.8 ml g<sup>–1</sup> h<sup>–1</sup>, reverse rate constants between 0.001 and 0.06 h<sup>–1</sup>, and site densities of 1.3, 0.104, and 0.026 μmol g<sup>–1</sup> for ‘weak/fast’, ‘strong/slow’, and ‘very strong/very slow’ sites provided the best fits. For pH 7.9, a three-site model with forward rate constants between 0.05 and 0.8 mL g<sup>–1</sup> h<sup>–1</sup>, reverse rate constants between 0.001 and 0.6 h<sup>–1</sup>, and site densities of 1.3, 0.039, and 0.013 μmol g<sup>–1</sup> for a ‘weak/fast’, ‘strong/slow’, and ‘very strong/very slow’ sites provided the best fits. Column retardation coefficients (R<sub>d</sub>) were 80 for pH 6.9 and 10.3 for pH 7.9. Model parameters determined from the batch and column experiments were used in 50 year large-scale simulations for continuous and pulse injections and indicated that a three-site model is necessary at pH 6.9, although a K<sub>d</sub>-type equilibrium partition model with one-site was adequate for large scale predictions at pH 7.9. Batch experiments were useful for predicting early breakthrough times in the columns while column experiments helped differentiate the relative importance of sorption sites and desorption rate constants on transport.","Elsevier","","Los Alamos National Lab.

The properties that must be controlled in glass formulation and waste vitrification plant operation tend to vary smoothly with composition allowing for glass property-composition models to be developed and used. Models have been fit to the key glass properties. The properties are transformed so that simple functions of composition (e.g., linear, polynomial, or component ratios) can be used as model forms. The model forms are fit to experimental data designed statistically to efficiently cover the composition space of interest. Examples of these models are found in literature. The glass property-composition models, their uncertainty definitions, property constraints, and optimality criteria are combined to formulate optimal glass compositions, control composition in vitrification plants, and to qualify waste glasses for disposal. An overview of current glass property-composition modeling techniques is summarized in this paper along with an example of how those models are applied to glass formulation and product qualification at the planned Hanford high-level waste vitrification plant.","Elsevier","","Pacific Northwest National Lab.

Generally, in a city different waste sources scatter throughout the city in heterogeneous way that increase waste collection and transportation cost in the waste management system. Therefore, a shortest waste collection and transportation strategy can effectively reduce waste collection and transportation cost. In this paper, we propose an optimal MSW collection and transportation scheme that focus on the problem of minimizing the length of each waste collection and transportation route. We first formulize the MSW collection and transportation problem into a mixed integer program. Moreover, we propose a heuristic solution for the waste collection and transportation problem that can provide an optimal way for waste collection and transportation. Extensive simulations and real testbed results show that the proposed solution can significantly improve the MSW performance. Results show that the proposed scheme is able to reduce more than 30% of the total waste collection path length.","","Available from http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.wasman.2015.06.033","","","","United States","2015-09-15T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: Waste Management; Journal Volume: 43; Other Information: Copyright (c) 2015 Elsevier Science B.V., Amsterdam, The Netherlands, All rights reserved.; Country of input: International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA)","","Medium: X; Size: page(s) 9-18","","","","Journal ID: ISSN 0956-053X; CODEN: WAMAE2; PII: S0956-053X(15)00443-2; TRN: US16R2247042352","10.1016/J.WASMAN.2015.06.033","","2016-05-09T00:00:00Z","22472538","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/22472538","","Waste Management","","43"

The SS–OFMSW mixture composed by 54% of the volatile solids fed (inlet-VS), at OLR of 3.1 kg{sub COD} m{sup −3} d{sup −1} (1.9 kg{sub VS} m{sup −3} d{sup −1}), showed the highest increment on the volumetric methane production and yield of +200% and +59% respectively, under stable conditions. The effect of particulate size was assessed with the same mixture and same operational conditions but reducing the OFMSW particulate size from 20 mm to 8 mm with the aim to improve the hydrolysis step, but the results showed any influence in the OFMSW particulate size range analysed. In addition, specific biomass activity was assessed at the end of each co-digestion period. Results showed that OFMSW promoted β-oxidation syntrophic acetogens and the acetoclastic methanogens activity; although the last increase of the OFMSW percentage (from 47% to 54% inlet-VS) affected negatively the specific substrate activity, but not inhibitory effect was observed. Therefore, the results obtained in the continuous experiment could be related with some inhibitory or toxic effect and not due to hydrolysis limitation. The specific biomass activity test was demonstrated to be an interesting tool to evaluate and control the co-digestion process, especially when conventional parameters did not explain the behaviour of the biological system.","","Available from http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.wasman.2015.06.029","","","","United States","2015-09-15T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: Waste Management; Journal Volume: 43; Other Information: Copyright (c) 2015 Elsevier Science B.V., Amsterdam, The Netherlands, All rights reserved.; Country of input: International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA)","","Medium: X; Size: page(s) 137-143","","","","Journal ID: ISSN 0956-053X; CODEN: WAMAE2; PII: S0956-053X(15)30001-5; TRN: US16R2251042356","10.1016/J.WASMAN.2015.06.029","","2016-05-09T00:00:00Z","22472542","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/22472542","","Waste Management","","43"

However, there is a great concern with respect to the fate of heavy metals (HM) contained in MSW and their environmental impact. In this study, a coupled two-scale CFD model was developed for MSWI in a bubbling fluidized bed. It presents an original scheme that combines a single particle model and a global fluidized bed model in order to represent the HM vaporization during MSW combustion. Two of the most representative HM (Cd and Pb) with bed temperatures ranging between 923 and 1073 K have been considered. This new approach uses ANSYS FLUENT 14.0 as the modelling platform for the simulations along with a complete set of self-developed user-defined functions (UDFs). The simulation results are compared to the experimental data obtained previously by the research group in a lab-scale fluid bed incinerator. The comparison indicates that the proposed CFD model predicts well the evolution of the HM release for the bed temperatures analyzed. It shows that both bed temperature and bed dynamics have influence on the HM vaporization rate. It can be concluded that CFD is a rigorous tool that provides valuable information about HM vaporization and that the original two-scale simulation scheme adopted allows to better represent the actual particle behavior in a fluid bed incinerator.","","Available from http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.wasman.2015.05.021","","","","United States","2015-09-15T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: Waste Management; Journal Volume: 43; Other Information: Copyright (c) 2015 Elsevier Science B.V., Amsterdam, The Netherlands, All rights reserved.; Country of input: International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA)","","Medium: X; Size: page(s) 176-187","","","","Journal ID: ISSN 0956-053X; CODEN: WAMAE2; PII: S0956-053X(15)00372-4; TRN: US16R2252042357","10.1016/J.WASMAN.2015.05.021","","2016-05-09T00:00:00Z","22472543","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/22472543","","Waste Management","","43"

The inhibitory effect of high NH{sub 4}{sup +}–N concentration on anaerobic biotreatment of fresh leachate from a MSW incineration plant in China has been investigated in this study. The inhibition processes was studied by both static tests and a laboratory-scale expanded granular sludge bed (EGSB) reactor. The specific methanogenic activity (SMA) of the microorganisms in anaerobic granular sludge was inhibited with the NH{sub 4}{sup +}–N concentration increasing to 1000 mg/L in static tests. As well the chemical oxygen demand (COD) removal efficiency and the methane yield decreased in the EGSB reactor, while the volatile fatty acids (VFAs) accumulated and extracellular polymeric substances (EPS) of the anaerobic granular sludge increased with NH{sub 4}{sup +}–N concentration rising to 1000 mg/L, without any rebounding during 30 days of operation. Decreasing NH{sub 4}{sup +}–N concentration to 500 mg/L in influent, the COD removal efficiency recovered to about 85% after 26 days. 1000 mg/L of NH{sub 4}{sup +}–N in leachate was suggested to be the inhibition threshold in EGSB reactor. High-throughput sequencing results showed little changes in microbial communities of the sludge for a high NH{sub 4}{sup +}–N concentration, indicating that the survival of most microorganisms was not affected under such a condition. It inhibited the bioactivity of the microorganisms, resulting in decrease of the COD removal efficiency.","","Available from http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.wasman.2015.06.031","","","","United States","2015-09-15T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: Waste Management; Journal Volume: 43; Other Information: Copyright (c) 2015 Elsevier Science B.V., Amsterdam, The Netherlands, All rights reserved.; Country of input: International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA)","","Medium: X; Size: page(s) 188-195","","","","Journal ID: ISSN 0956-053X; CODEN: WAMAE2; PII: S0956-053X(15)30003-9; TRN: US16R2253042358","10.1016/J.WASMAN.2015.06.031","","2016-05-09T00:00:00Z","22472544","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/22472544","","Waste Management","","43"

Alkaline hydrothermal liquefaction of swine carcasses to bio-oil was performed. Firstly, the effects of temperature, reaction time and pH value on the yield of each liquefaction product were determined. Secondly, liquefaction products, including bio-oil and solid residue, were characterized. Finally, the energy recovery ratio (ERR), which was defined as the energy of the resultant products compared to the energy input of the material, was investigated. Our experiment shows that reaction time had certain influence on the yield of liquefaction products, but temperature and pH value had bigger influence on the yield of liquefaction products. Yields of 62.2 wt% bio-oil, having a high heating value of 32.35 MJ/kg and a viscosity of 305cp, and 22 wt% solid residue were realized at a liquefaction temperature of 250 °C, a reaction time of 60 min and a pH value of 9.0. The bio-oil contained up to hundreds of different chemical components that may be classified according to functional groups. Typical compound classes in the bio-oil were hydrocarbons, organic acids, esters, ketones and heterocyclics. The energy recovery ratio (ERR) reached 93.63%. The bio-oil is expected to contribute to fossil fuel replacement in stationary applications, including boilers and furnaces, and upgrading processes for the bio-oil may be used to obtain liquid transport fuels.","","Available from http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.wasman.2015.05.010","","","","United States","2015-09-15T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: Waste Management; Journal Volume: 43; Other Information: Copyright (c) 2015 Elsevier Science B.V., Amsterdam, The Netherlands, All rights reserved.; Country of input: International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA)","","Medium: X; Size: page(s) 230-238","","","","Journal ID: ISSN 0956-053X; CODEN: WAMAE2; PII: S0956-053X(15)00361-X; TRN: US16R2254042359","10.1016/J.WASMAN.2015.05.010","","2016-05-09T00:00:00Z","22472545","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/22472545","","Waste Management","","43"

Along the life cycle of a nano-enabled product, ENMs can be released and subsequently accumulate in the environment. Material flow models also indicate that a variety of ENMs may accumulate in waste streams. Therefore, a new type of waste, so-called nanowaste, is generated when end-of-life ENMs and nano-enabled products are disposed of. In terms of the precautionary principle, environmental monitoring of end-of-life ENMs is crucial to allow assessment of the potential impact of nanowaste on our ecosystem. Trace analysis and quantification of nanoparticulate species is very challenging because of the variety of ENM types that are used in products and low concentrations of nanowaste expected in complex environmental media. In the framework of this paper, challenges in nanowaste characterisation and appropriate analytical techniques which can be applied to nanowaste analysis are summarised. Recent case studies focussing on the characterisation of ENMs in waste streams are discussed. Most studies aim to investigate the fate of nanowaste during incineration, particularly considering aerosol measurements; whereas, detailed studies focusing on the potential release of nanowaste during waste recycling processes are currently not available. In terms of suitable analytical methods, separation techniques coupled to spectrometry-based methods are promising tools to detect nanowaste and determine particle size distribution in liquid waste samples. Standardised leaching protocols can be applied to generate soluble fractions stemming from solid wastes, while micro- and ultrafiltration can be used to enrich nanoparticulate species. Imaging techniques combined with X-ray-based methods are powerful tools for determining particle size, morphology and screening elemental composition. However, quantification of nanowaste is currently hampered due to the problem to differentiate engineered from naturally-occurring nanoparticles. A promising approach to face these challenges in nanowaste characterisation might be the application of nanotracers with unique optical properties, elemental or isotopic fingerprints. At present, there is also a need to develop and standardise analytical protocols regarding nanowaste sampling, separation and quantification. In general, more experimental studies are needed to examine the fate and transport of ENMs in waste streams and to deduce transfer coefficients, respectively to develop reliable material flow models.","","Available from http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.wasman.2015.05.035","","","","United States","2015-09-15T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: Waste Management; Journal Volume: 43; Other Information: Copyright (c) 2015 Elsevier Science B.V., Amsterdam, The Netherlands, All rights reserved.; Country of input: International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA)","","Medium: X; Size: page(s) 407-420","","","","Journal ID: ISSN 0956-053X; CODEN: WAMAE2; PII: S0956-053X(15)00410-9; TRN: US16R2258042363","10.1016/J.WASMAN.2015.05.035","","2016-05-09T00:00:00Z","22472549","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/22472549","","Waste Management","","43"

Recently questions were posed by the Florida regulatory community on whether lime WTR that contained a small percentage of other treatment additives could appropriately be characterized as lime WTR, in terms of total element content and leachability. A study was done using a broad range of leaching tests, including a framework of tests recently adopted by the United States-Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) and tests that were modified to account for scenario specific conditions, such as the presence of natural organic matter (NOM). The results of these additional leaching tests demonstrated that certain applications, including disposal in a water body with NOM or in placement anaerobic environment, did result in increased leaching of elements such as Fe, and that a site specific assessment should be conducted prior to using WTR in these types of applications. This study illustrates the importance of leaching test selection when attempting to provide an estimation of release in practice. Although leaching tests are just one component in a beneficial use assessment and other factors including aquifer and soil properties play a significant role in the outcome, leaching tests should be tailored to most appropriately represent the scenario or reuse application being evaluated.","","Available from http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.wasman.2015.06.015","","","","United States","2015-09-15T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: Waste Management; Journal Volume: 43; Other Information: Copyright (c) 2015 Elsevier Science B.V., Amsterdam, The Netherlands, All rights reserved.; Country of input: International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA)","","Medium: X; Size: page(s) 524-532","","","","Journal ID: ISSN 0956-053X; CODEN: WAMAE2; PII: S0956-053X(15)00429-8; TRN: US16R2262042367","10.1016/J.WASMAN.2015.06.015","","2016-05-09T00:00:00Z","22472553","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/22472553","","Waste Management","","43"

The waste generation rates of SIDS were compared within the three geographic regions namely Caribbean SIDS, Pacific SIDS and Atlantic, Indian Ocean, Mediterranean and South China (AIMS) SIDS and with countries of the Organisation for Economic Co-Operation and Development (OECD). Only Pacific SIDS had a waste generation rate less than 1 kg/capita/day. The waste generation rates for the three SIDS regions averaged 1.29 kg/capita/day while that for OECD countries was at a mean value of 1.35 kg/capita/day. The waste compositions in the different SIDS regions were almost similar owing to comparable consumption patterns while these differed to a large extent with wastes generated in OECD countries. In SIDS, the major fraction of MSW comprised of organics (44%) followed by recyclables namely paper, plastics, glass and metals (total: 43%). In contrast, MSW in OECD countries consisted mainly of recyclables (43%) followed by organics (37%). This article also reviewed the other functional elements of the waste management systems in SIDS. Several shortcomings were noted in the process of waste collection, transfer and transport namely the fact of having outdated collection vehicles and narrow roads which are inaccessible. Among the waste management practices in SIDS, waste disposal via landfilling, illegal dumping and backyard burning were favoured most of the time at the expense of sustainable waste treatment technologies such as composting, anaerobic digestion and recycling.","","Available from http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.wasman.2015.06.012","","","","United States","2015-09-15T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: Waste Management; Journal Volume: 43; Other Information: Copyright (c) 2015 Elsevier Science B.V., Amsterdam, The Netherlands, All rights reserved.; Country of input: International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA)","","Medium: X; Size: page(s) 539-549","","","","Journal ID: ISSN 0956-053X; CODEN: WAMAE2; PII: S0956-053X(15)00426-2; TRN: US16R2263042368","10.1016/J.WASMAN.2015.06.012","","2016-05-09T00:00:00Z","22472554","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/22472554","","Waste Management","","43"

The tool uses Quick Domenico Multi-scenario (QDM), a spreadsheet implementation of Domenico-based solute transport, to estimate concentrations of contaminants reaching receptors under steady-state conditions from a constant-strength source. Unlike most other available Domenico-based model applications, QDM calculates the time for down-gradient contaminant concentrations to approach steady state and appropriate dispersivity values, and allows for up to fifty simulations on a single spreadsheet. Sensitivity of QDM solutions to critical model parameters was quantified. The screening tool uses QDM results to categorize landfills as having high, moderate and low levels of concern, based on contaminant concentrations reaching receptors relative to regulatory concentrations. The application of this tool was demonstrated by assessing levels of concern (as defined by the New Jersey Pinelands Commission) for thirty closed, uncapped landfills in the New Jersey Pinelands National Reserve, using historic water-quality data from monitoring wells on and near landfills and hydraulic parameters from regional flow models. Twelve of these landfills are categorized as having high levels of concern, indicating a need for further assessment. This tool is not a replacement for conventional numerically-based transport model or other available Domenico-based applications, but is suitable for quickly assessing the level of concern posed by a landfill or other contaminant point source before expensive and lengthy monitoring or remediation measures are taken. In addition to quantifying the level of concern using historic groundwater-monitoring data, the tool allows for archiving model scenarios and adding refinements as new data become available.","","Available from http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.wasman.2015.04.009","","","","United States","2015-09-15T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: Waste Management; Journal Volume: 43; Other Information: Copyright (c) 2015 Elsevier Science B.V., Amsterdam, The Netherlands, All rights reserved.; Country of input: International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA)","","Medium: X; Size: page(s) 363-375","","","","Journal ID: ISSN 0956-053X; CODEN: WAMAE2; PII: S0956-053X(15)00281-0; TRN: US16R2257042362","10.1016/J.WASMAN.2015.04.009","","2016-05-09T00:00:00Z","22472548","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/22472548","","Waste Management","","43"

In this work, its standard enthalpy of formation, $-$1,779.6 ± 1.9 kJ/mol, was obtained by high temperature oxide melt drop solution calorimetry. Decomposition of synthetic metastudtite was characterized by thermogravimetry and differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) with ex situ X-ray diffraction analysis. We observed four decomposition steps in oxygen atmosphere: water loss around 220 °C associated with an endothermic heat effect accompanied by amorphization; another water loss from 400 °C to 530 °C; oxygen loss from amorphous UO<sub>3</sub> to crystallize orthorhombic α-UO<sub>2.9</sub>; and reduction to crystalline U<sub>3</sub>O<sub>8</sub>. This detailed characterization allowed calculation of formation enthalpy from heat effects on decomposition measured by DSC and by transposed temperature drop calorimetry, and both these values agree with that from drop solution calorimetry. The data explain the irreversible transformation from studtite to metastudtite, the conditions under which metastudtite may form, and its significant role in the oxidation, corrosion, and dissolution of nuclear fuel in contact with water.","Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences","","Energy Frontier Research Centers (EFRC) (United States).

The solvent was thermally treated at 35 C over a period of 13 months whilst in dynamic contact with each of the aqueous phases of the current NGS process, namely SRS 15 (a highly caustic waste simulant), sodium hydroxide scrub solution (0.025 M), and boric acid strip solution (0.01 M). The effect of thermal treatment was evaluated by assessing batch extract/scrub/strip performance as a function of time, by monitoring the sodium extraction capacity of the solvent, and by analysis of the solvent using electrospray mass spectrometry. Current studies indicate that the NGS solvent should be thermally robust for a period of XXX months at the Modular Caustic-Side Solvent Extraction Unit (MCU) pilot plant located at Savannah River Site. Furthermore, the guanidine suppressor appears to be the solvent component most significantly impacted by thermal treatment of the solvent, showing significant degradation over time.","Taylor and Francis","","Oak Ridge National Lab.

This has put a burden on landfilling, which is the major waste disposal method. Waste reduction, re-use and recycling opportunities exist but are not fully utilized. The common items that are re-used and re-cycled are plastics, paper, aluminum, glass, steel, cardboard, and yard waste. This paper develops an overview of reverse logistics at Kiteezi landfill, the only officially recognised waste disposal facility for Kampala City. The paper analyses, in details the collection, re-processing, re-distribution and final markets of these products into a reversed supply chain network. Only 14% of the products at Kiteezi landfill are channeled into the reverse chain while 63% could be included in the distribution chain but are left out and disposed of while the remaining 23% is buried. This is because of the low processing power available, lack of market value, lack of knowledge and limited value addition activities to the products. This paper proposes possible strategies of efficient and effective reverse logistics development, applicable to Kampala City and other similar cities.","","Available from http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.wasman.2015.04.012","","","","United States","2015-08-15T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: Waste Management; Journal Volume: 42; Other Information: Copyright (c) 2015 Elsevier Science B.V., Amsterdam, The Netherlands, All rights reserved.; Country of input: International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA)","","Medium: X; Size: page(s) 82-92","","","","Journal ID: ISSN 0956-053X; CODEN: WAMAE2; PII: S0956-053X(15)00284-6; TRN: US16R2241042346","10.1016/J.WASMAN.2015.04.012","","2016-05-09T00:00:00Z","22472532","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/22472532","","Waste Management","","42"

Meanwhile, calcium-based compounds are the main constituents in both municipal solid waste incineration bottom ash (MSWIBA) and stabilized air pollution control residues (SAPCR), which would increase the risk of LCS clogging once these calcium-rich residues were disposed in landfills. The leaching behaviors of calcium from the four compounds and municipal solid waste incineration (MSWI) residues were studied, and the influencing factors on leaching were discussed. The results showed that pH was the crucial factor in the calcium leaching process. CaCO{sub 3} and CaSiO{sub 3} began leaching when the leachate pH decreased to less than 7 and 10, respectively, while Ca{sub 3}(PO{sub 4}){sub 2} leached at pH < 12. CaSO{sub 4} could hardly dissolve in the experimental conditions. Moreover, the sequence of the leaching rate for the different calcium-based compounds is as follows: CaSiO{sub 3} > Ca{sub 3}(PO{sub 4}){sub 2} > CaCO{sub 3}. The calcium leaching from the MSWIBA and SAPCR separately started from pH < 7 and pH < 12, resulting from CaCO{sub 3} and Ca{sub 3}(PO{sub 4}){sub 2} leaching respectively, which was proven by the X-ray diffraction results. Based on the leaching characteristics of the different calcium compounds and the mineral phase of calcium in the incineration residues, simulated computation of their clogging potential was conducted, providing the theoretical basis for the risk assessment pertaining to LCS clogging in landfills.","","Available from http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.wasman.2015.04.017","","","","United States","2015-08-15T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: Waste Management; Journal Volume: 42; Other Information: Copyright (c) 2015 Elsevier Science B.V., Amsterdam, The Netherlands, All rights reserved.; Country of input: International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA)","","Medium: X; Size: page(s) 93-100","","","","Journal ID: ISSN 0956-053X; CODEN: WAMAE2; PII: S0956-053X(15)00312-8; TRN: US16R2242042347","10.1016/J.WASMAN.2015.04.017","","2016-05-09T00:00:00Z","22472533","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/22472533","","Waste Management","","42"

Their uses in many applications have made them present in municipal solid waste (MSW) and in commercial and industrial waste (C&I), since several industrial processes produce by-products with high content of these metals. With over 4000 landfills in the UK alone, the aim of this study was to assess the existence of these critical metals within landfills. Samples collected from four closed landfills in UK were subjected to a two-step acid digestion to extract 27 metals of interest. Concentrations across the four landfill sites were 58 ± 6 mg kg{sup −1} for REEs comprising 44 ± 8 mg kg{sup −1} for light REEs, 11 ± 2 mg kg{sup −1} for heavy REEs and 3 ± 1 mg kg{sup −1} for Scandium (Sc) and 3 ± 1.0 mg kg{sup −1} of PGMs. Compared to the typical concentration in ores, these concentrations are too low to achieve a commercially viable extraction. However, content of other highly valuable metals (Al and Cu) was found in concentrations equating to a combined value across the four landfills of around $400 million, which increases the economic viability of landfill mining. Presence of critical metals will mainly depend on the type of waste that was buried but the recovery of these metals through landfill mining is possible and is economically feasible only if additional materials (plastics, paper, metallic items and other) are also recovered for reprocessing.","","Available from http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.wasman.2015.04.024","","","","United States","2015-08-15T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: Waste Management; Journal Volume: 42; Other Information: Copyright (c) 2015 Elsevier Science B.V., Amsterdam, The Netherlands, All rights reserved.; Country of input: International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA)","","Medium: X; Size: page(s) 128-136","","","","Journal ID: ISSN 0956-053X; CODEN: WAMAE2; PII: S0956-053X(15)00319-0; TRN: US16R2243042348","10.1016/J.WASMAN.2015.04.024","","2016-05-09T00:00:00Z","22472534","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/22472534","","Waste Management","","42"

The analysis is done using a direct costs/revenues approach and the stochastic uncertainties are handled using Monte Carlo simulation. Two remediation scenarios are applied to a hypothetical landfill. One scenario includes only remediation, while the second scenario adds resource recovery to the remediation project. Moreover, the second scenario is divided into two cases, case A and B. In case A, the landfill tax needs to be paid for re-deposited material and the landfill holder does not own a combined heat and power plant (CHP), which leads to disposal costs in the form of gate fees. In case B, the landfill tax is waived on the re-deposited material and the landfill holder owns its own CHP. Results show that the remediation project in the first scenario costs about €23/ton. Adding resource recovery as in case A worsens the result to −€36/ton, while for case B the result improves to −€14/ton. This shows the importance of landfill tax and the access to a CHP. Other important factors for the result are the material composition in the landfill, the efficiency of the separation technology used, and the price of the saleable material.","","Available from http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.wasman.2015.04.008","","","","United States","2015-08-15T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: Waste Management; Journal Volume: 42; Other Information: Copyright (c) 2015 Elsevier Science B.V., Amsterdam, The Netherlands, All rights reserved.; Country of input: International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA)","","Medium: X; Size: page(s) 137-147","","","","Journal ID: ISSN 0956-053X; CODEN: WAMAE2; PII: S0956-053X(15)00280-9; TRN: US16R2244042349","10.1016/J.WASMAN.2015.04.008","","2016-05-09T00:00:00Z","22472535","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/22472535","","Waste Management","","42"

End-of-life LCDs represent a possible source of indium in the field of urban mining. In the present paper, we apply, for the first time, cross-current leaching to mobilize indium from end-of-life LCD panels. We carried out a series of treatments to leach indium. The best leaching conditions for indium were 2 M sulfuric acid at 80 °C for 10 min, which allowed us to completely mobilize indium. Taking into account the low content of indium in end-of-life LCDs, of about 100 ppm, a single step of leaching is not cost-effective. We tested 6 steps of cross-current leaching: in the first step indium leaching was complete, whereas in the second step it was in the range of 85–90%, and with 6 steps it was about 50–55%. Indium concentration in the leachate was about 35 mg/L after the first step of leaching, almost 2-fold at the second step and about 3-fold at the fifth step. Then, we hypothesized to scale up the process of cross-current leaching up to 10 steps, followed by cementation with zinc to recover indium. In this simulation, the process of indium recovery was advantageous from an economic and environmental point of view. Indeed, cross-current leaching allowed to concentrate indium, save reagents, and reduce the emission of CO{sub 2} (with 10 steps we assessed that the emission of about 90 kg CO{sub 2}-Eq. could be avoided) thanks to the recovery of indium. This new strategy represents a useful approach for secondary production of indium from waste LCD panels.","","Available from http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.wasman.2015.04.035","","","","United States","2015-08-15T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: Waste Management; Journal Volume: 42; Other Information: Copyright (c) 2015 Elsevier Science B.V., Amsterdam, The Netherlands, All rights reserved.; Country of input: International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA)","","Medium: X; Size: page(s) 180-187","","","","Journal ID: ISSN 0956-053X; CODEN: WAMAE2; PII: S0956-053X(15)00330-X; TRN: US16R2245042350","10.1016/J.WASMAN.2015.04.035","","2016-05-09T00:00:00Z","22472536","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/22472536","","Waste Management","","42"

Despite the trend, the only deciding factor can still be the total costs. This article answers the question of how greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions should be taken into account in municipal solid waste (MSW) management when selecting an incineration plant for source separated mixed MSW. The aim is to guide the decision making of MSW management towards more environmentally friendly procurements. The study was carried out by calculating the global warming potentials (GWPs) and costs of mixed MSW management by using the waste composition from a case area in Finland. Scenarios of landfilling and combustion in three actual waste incineration plants were used to recognise the main processes that affect the results. GWP results show that the combustion of mixed MSW is a better alternative than landfilling the waste. The GHG results from combustion are greatly affected by emissions from the combustion and substituted energy production. The significance of collection and transportation is higher from the costs’ perspective than from the point of view of GHG emissions. The main costs, in addition to collection and transportation costs, result from the energy utilization or landfilling of mixed MSW. When tenders are invited for the incineration location of mixed MSW, the main focus should be: What are the annual electricity and heat recovery efficiencies and which are the substituted fuels in the area? In addition, in the case of a fluidized bed combustor it is crucial to know the combusted share of mixed MSW after preparing solid recovered fuel (SRF) and the treatment of rejects. The environmental criteria for the waste incineration plant procurements should be made in order to obtain clear instructions for the procurement units. The results can also be utilized more widely. The substituted fuels in the area and the effect of the plant location on the utilization of the produced energy can already be identified when planning an appropriate site for the waste incineration plant.","","Available from http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.wasman.2015.03.040","","","","United States","2015-08-15T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: Waste Management; Journal Volume: 42; Other Information: Copyright (c) 2015 Elsevier Science B.V., Amsterdam, The Netherlands, All rights reserved.; Country of input: International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA)","","Medium: X; Size: page(s) 196-207","","","","Journal ID: ISSN 0956-053X; CODEN: WAMAE2; PII: S0956-053X(15)00234-2; TRN: US16R2246042351","10.1016/J.WASMAN.2015.03.040","","2016-05-09T00:00:00Z","22472537","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/22472537","","Waste Management","","42"

When this waste reacts with subsurface sediments, feldspathoid minerals (sodalite, cancrinite) can form, sequestering pertechnetate (<sup>99</sup>TcO<sub>4</sub><sup>–</sup>) and other ions. This study investigates the potential for incorporation of perrhenate (ReO<sub>4</sub><sup>–</sup>), a chemical surrogate for <sup>99</sup>TcO<sub>4</sub><sup>–</sup>, into mixed perrhenate/nitrate (ReO<sub>4</sub><sup>–</sup>/NO<sub>3</sub><sup>–</sup>) sodalite. Mixed-anion sodalites were hydrothermally synthesized in the laboratory from zeolite A in sodium hydroxide, nitrate, and perrhenate solutions at 90 °C for 24 h. The resulting solids were characterized by bulk chemical analysis, X-ray diffraction, scanning electron microscopy, and X-ray absorption near edge structure spectroscopy (XANES) to determine the products’ chemical composition, structure, morphology, and Re oxidation state. The XANES data indicated that nearly all rhenium (Re) was incorporated as Re(VII)O<sub>4</sub><sup>–</sup>. The nonlinear increase of the unit cell parameter with ReO<sub>4</sub><sup>–</sup>/NO<sub>3</sub><sup>–</sup> ratios suggests formation of two separate sodalite phases in lieu of a mixed-anion sodalite. The results reveal that the sodalite cage is highly selective toward NO<sub>3</sub><sup>–</sup> over ReO<sub>4</sub><sup>–</sup>. Calculated enthalpy and Gibbs free energy of formation at 298 K for NO<sub>3</sub><sup>-</sup> and ReO<sub>4</sub><sup>-</sup>sodalite suggest that NO<sub>3</sub><sup>–</sup> incorporation into the cage is favored over the incorporation of the larger ReO<sub>4</sub><sup>–</sup>, due to the smaller ionic radius of NO<sub>3</sub><sup>–</sup>. In conclusion, based on these results, it is expected that NO<sub>3</sub><sup>–</sup>, which is present at significantly higher concentrations in alkaline waste solutions than <sup>99</sup>TcO<sub>4</sub><sup>–</sup>, will be strongly preferred for incorporation into the sodalite cage.","American Chemical Society","","Lawrence Berkeley National Lab.

For this reason, we conducted a series of macroscopic batch experiments combined with a variety of bulk characterization studies (Mössbauer and laser spectroscopy), micro-scale inspections (µ-XRF), and molecular scale interrogations (XANES) with the objectives to: i) determine the extent of U(VI) partitioning to Hanford sediments previously exposed to acidic waste simulants (pH = 2 and pH = 5) and under neutral conditions (pH = 8) at varying background solution concentrations (i.e., NaNO<sub>3</sub>); ii) determine micron-scale solid phase associated U valence state and phase identity; and iii) provide information for a plausible conceptual model of U(VI) attenuation under waste plume acidic conditions. The results of the batch experiments showed that the acid pre-treated sediment had high affinity for aqueous U(VI), which was removed from solution via two pH dependent and apparently different mechanisms (adsorption at pH = 2 and precipitation at pH = 5). The micro-scale inspections and XANES analyses confirmed that high concentration areas were rich mainly in U(VI), demonstrating that most of the added U(VI) was not reduced to U(IV). The laser spectroscopy data showed that uranyl phosphates {e.g. metaautunite [Ca(UO<sub>2</sub>)<sub>2</sub>(PO<sub>4</sub>)<sub>2</sub>•10-12H<sub>2</sub>O] and phosphuranylite [KCa(H<sub>3</sub>O)<sub>3</sub>(UO<sub>2</sub>)<sub>7</sub>(PO<sub>4</sub>)<sub>4</sub>O<sub>4</sub>•8(H<sub>2</sub>O)]} were present in the sediments. They also showed clear differences between the U bearing phases in the experiments conducted in the presence or absence of air. As a result, the data generated from these experiments will help in a better understanding of the reactions and processes that have a significant effect and/or control U mobility.","Elsevier","","Pacific Northwest National Lab.

The results reported in this work are compared to our recent demonstration of a complete actinide recovery from a simulated dissolved fuel solution using a synergistic combination of bis(o-trifluoromethylphenyl)dithiophosphinic acid (“1”) and TOPO dissolved in either toluene or trifluoromethylphenyl sulfone. While the extraction efficiency of americium was enhanced for the liquid-liquid system containing “0”, enabling to accomplish a trivalent An/Ln separation at 1.0 M HNO3, the extraction of neptunium was drastically diminished, relative to “1”. The partitioning behavior of curium was also negatively impacted, introducing an effective opportunity for americium/curium separation. Radiometric and spectrophotometric studies demonstrate that the complete actinide recovery using the solvent based upon “0” and TOPO is not feasible.

"Analysis of Powder Airborne Release Fractions for Vessel Ruptures","Laurinat, James E.; Hensel, Steve J.","12 MANAGEMENT OF RADIOACTIVE AND NON-RADIOACTIVE WASTES FROM NUCLEAR FACILITIES","The Department of Energy handbook for airborne releases from nonreactor nuclear facilities bases its bounding airborne release fraction (ARF) for pressurized powders on tests conducted at Pacific Northwest Laboratory (PNL). An analysis is presented that correlates the ARF from these tests. The amount of powder that becomes airborne is correlated in terms of an adjusted airborne release fraction (AARF) equal to the product of the powder entrainment from the powder bed and the ratio of the total vessel volume to the volume occupied by the powder bed. Powder entrainments and release fractions at low pressures are correlated using a fluidized bed analogy. The analysis shows that the entrainment is enhanced by a sonic shock if the pressure prior to the rupture exceeds approximately 33 psig. A secondary, three-dimensional shock is predicted to occur at an initial pressure of approximately 332 psig. A correlation based on this analysis is used to predict the ARF for ruptures of vessels containing plutonium oxide. It is assumed that the oxide is pressurized by hydrogen that is radiolytically generated from adsorbed moisture.","ASME","available","Savannah River Site (SRS), Aiken, SC (United States).

Three laboratory-scale reactors, an anaerobic (A1) and two hybrid bioreactors (C1 and C2), were constructed and operated for about 10 months. The hybrid bioreactors were operated in an aerobic–anaerobic mode with different aeration frequencies by providing air into the upper layer of waste. Results showed that the temporary aeration into the upper layer aided methane generation by shortening the initial acidogenic phase because of volatile fatty acids (VFAs) reduction and pH increase. Chemical oxygen demand (COD) decreased faster in the hybrid bioreactors, but the concentrations of ammonia–nitrogen in the hybrid bioreactors were greater than those in the anaerobic control. Methanogenic conditions were established within 75 d and 60 d in C1 and C2, respectively. However, high aeration frequency led to the consumption of organic matters by aerobic degradation and resulted in reducing accumulative methane volume. The temporary aeration enhanced waste settlement and the settlement increased with increasing the frequency of aeration. Methane production was inhibited in the anaerobic control; however, the total methane generations from hybrid bioreactors were 133.4 L/kg{sub vs} and 113.2 L/kg{sub vs}. As for MSW with high content of food waste, leachate recirculation right after aeration stopped was not recommended due to VFA inhibition for methanogens.","","Available from http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.wasman.2015.03.023","","","","United States","2015-07-15T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: Waste Management; Journal Volume: 41; Other Information: Copyright (c) 2015 Elsevier Science B.V., Amsterdam, The Netherlands, All rights reserved.; Country of input: International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA)","","Medium: X; Size: page(s) 94-100","","","","Journal ID: ISSN 0956-053X; CODEN: WAMAE2; PII: S0956-053X(15)00215-9; TRN: US16R2232042337","10.1016/J.WASMAN.2015.03.023","","2016-05-09T00:00:00Z","22472523","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/22472523","","Waste Management","","41"

This is mainly due to lack of data on sewage sludge contamination by organic pollutants, and possible negative effects to the environment. However, waste management has become an acute problem in many countries. Management options require extensive waste characterization, since many of them may contain compounds which could be harmful to the ecosystem, such as heavy metals, organic pollutants. The present study aims to show the true European position, regarding the polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) content of sewage sludge, by comparing the Italian PAHs content with European Union countries, and at assessing the suitability of sewage sludge as soil fertilizer. The FOCUS Pearl model was used to estimate the concentration of benzo [a] pyrene (B(a)Pyr), the most toxic PAH in soil, and its exposure to organisms was then evaluated. The simulated B(a)Pyr and PAHs, expressed as B(a)Pyr, concentrations in soil were much lower than the B(a)Pyr’s most conservative lowest observable effect concentration (LOEC) for soil organisms. Furthermore, the results obtained indicate that it is more appropriate to apply 5 t ha{sup −1} sewage sludge annually than 15 t ha{sup −1} triennially. Results suggest, the EU maximum recommended limit of 6 mg kg{sup −1} PAHs in sewage sludge, should be conservative enough to avoid groundwater contamination and negative effects on soil organisms.","","Available from http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.wasman.2015.03.018","","","","United States","2015-07-15T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: Waste Management; Journal Volume: 41; Other Information: Copyright (c) 2015 Elsevier Science B.V., Amsterdam, The Netherlands, All rights reserved.; Country of input: International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA)","","Medium: X; Size: page(s) 119-127","","","","Journal ID: ISSN 0956-053X; CODEN: WAMAE2; PII: S0956-053X(15)00210-X; TRN: US16R2235042340","10.1016/J.WASMAN.2015.03.018","","2016-05-09T00:00:00Z","22472526","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/22472526","","Waste Management","","41"

The possibility of recovering such products can be seen as an effective way to reduce such a phenomenon, improve supply chain performances and ameliorate the conditions of undernourished people. The topic has been already investigated by a previous paper enforcing the hypothesis of deterministic and constant Shelf Life (SL) of products. However, such a model cannot be properly extended to products affected by uncertainties of the SL as it does not take into account the deterioration costs and loss of profits due to the overcoming of the SL within the cycle time. Thus the present paper presents an extension of the previous one under stochastic conditions of the food quality. Differently from the previous publication, this work represents a general model applicable to all supply chains, especially to those managing fresh products characterized by uncertain SL such as fruits and vegetables. The deterioration costs and loss of profits are included in the model and the optimal time at which to withdraw the products from the shelves as well as the quantities to be shipped at each alternative destination have been determined. A comparison of the proposed model with that reported in the previous publication has been carried out in order to underline the impact of the SL variability on the optimality conditions. The results show that the food recovery strategy in the presence of uncertainty of the food quality is rewarding, even if the optimal profit is lower than that of the deterministic case.","","Available from http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.wasman.2015.03.028","","","","United States","2015-07-15T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: Waste Management; Journal Volume: 41; Other Information: Copyright (c) 2015 Elsevier Science B.V., Amsterdam, The Netherlands, All rights reserved.; Country of input: International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA)","","Medium: X; Size: page(s) 159-168","","","","Journal ID: ISSN 0956-053X; CODEN: WAMAE2; PII: S0956-053X(15)00222-6; TRN: US16R2238042343","10.1016/J.WASMAN.2015.03.028","","2016-05-09T00:00:00Z","22472529","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/22472529","","Waste Management","","41"

In this work, an alternative process for recovering Au, Ag, and Pd from waste PCBs of mobile phones by supercritical water oxidation (SCWO) pre-treatment combined with iodine–iodide leaching process was developed. In the process, the waste PCBs of mobile phones were pre-treated in supercritical water, then a diluted hydrochloric acid leaching (HL) process was used to recovery the Cu, whose leaching efficiency was approximately 100%, finally the resulting residue was subjected to the iodine–iodide leaching process for recovering the Au, Ag, and Pd. Experimental results indicated that SCWO pre-treatment temperature, time, and pressure had significant influence on the Au, Ag, and Pd leaching from (SCWO + HL)-treated waste PCBs. The optimal SCWO pre-treatment conditions were 420 °C and 60 min for Au and Pd, and 410 °C and 30 min for Ag. The optimum dissolution parameters for Au, Pd, and Ag in (SCWO + HL)-treated PCBs with iodine–iodide system were leaching time of 120 min (90 min for Ag), iodine/iodide mole ratio of 1:5 (1:6 for Ag), solid-to-liquid ratio (S/L) of 1:10 g/mL (1:8 g/mL for Ag), and pH of 9, respectively. It is believed that the process developed in this study is environment friendly for the recovery of Au, Ag, and Pd from waste PCBs of mobile phones by SCWO pre-treatment combined with iodine–iodide leaching process.","","Available from http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.wasman.2015.02.020","","","","United States","2015-07-15T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: Waste Management; Journal Volume: 41; Other Information: Copyright (c) 2015 Elsevier Science B.V., Amsterdam, The Netherlands, All rights reserved.; Country of input: International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA)","","Medium: X; Size: page(s) 134-141","","","","Journal ID: ISSN 0956-053X; CODEN: WAMAE2; PII: S0956-053X(15)00103-8; TRN: US16R2236042341","10.1016/J.WASMAN.2015.02.020","","2016-05-09T00:00:00Z","22472527","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/22472527","","Waste Management","","41"

Initially leaching of PCB was carried out in shake flasks to assess the effects of particle size (−208 μm + 147 μm), ferrous iron concentration (1.25–10.0 g/L) and pH (1.5–2.5) on copper leaching using mesophile and moderate thermophile microorganisms. Only at a relatively low solid content (10.0 g/L) complete copper extraction was achieved from the particle size investigated. Conversely, high copper extractions were possible from coarse-ground PCB (20 mm-long) working with increased solids concentration (up to 25.0 g/L). Because there was as the faster leaching kinetics at 50 °C Sulfobacillus thermosulfidooxidans was selected for experiments in a rotating-drum reactor with the coarser-sized PCB sheets. Under optimal conditions, copper extraction reached 85%, in 8 days and microscopic observations by SEM–EDS of the on non-leached and leached material suggested that metal dissolution from the internal layers was restricted by the fact that metal surface was not entirely available and accessible for the solution in the case of the 20 mm-size sheets.","","Available from http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.wasman.2015.04.001","","","","United States","2015-07-15T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: Waste Management; Journal Volume: 41; Other Information: Copyright (c) 2015 Elsevier Science B.V., Amsterdam, The Netherlands, All rights reserved.; Country of input: International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA)","","Medium: X; Size: page(s) 148-158","","","","Journal ID: ISSN 0956-053X; CODEN: WAMAE2; PII: S0956-053X(15)00238-X; TRN: US16R2237042342","10.1016/J.WASMAN.2015.04.001","","2016-05-09T00:00:00Z","22472528","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/22472528","","Waste Management","","41"
"An Approach for Validating Actinide and Fission Product Burnup Credit Criticality Safety Analyses: Criticality (k<sub>eff</sub>) Predictions","Scaglione, John M.; Mueller, Don E.; Wagner, John C.","12 MANAGEMENT OF RADIOACTIVE AND NON-RADIOACTIVE WASTES FROM NUCLEAR FACILITIES; criticality; burnup; validation; spent nuclear fuel","One of the most important remaining challenges associated with expanded implementation of burnup credit in the United States is the validation of depletion and criticality calculations used in the safety evaluation—in particular, the availability and use of applicable measured data to support validation, especially for fission products (FPs). Applicants and regulatory reviewers have been constrained by both a scarcity of data and a lack of clear technical basis or approach for use of the data. In this study, this paper describes a validation approach for commercial spent nuclear fuel (SNF) criticality safety (k<sub>eff</sub>) evaluations based on best-available data and methods and applies the approach for representative SNF storage and transport configurations/conditions to demonstrate its usage and applicability, as well as to provide reference bias results. The criticality validation approach utilizes not only available laboratory critical experiment (LCE) data from the International Handbook of Evaluated Criticality Safety Benchmark Experiments and the French Haut Taux de Combustion program to support validation of the principal actinides but also calculated sensitivities, nuclear data uncertainties, and limited available FP LCE data to predict and verify individual biases for relevant minor actinides and FPs. The results demonstrate that (a) sufficient critical experiment data exist to adequately validate k<sub>eff</sub> calculations via conventional validation approaches for the primary actinides, (b) sensitivity-based critical experiment selection is more appropriate for generating accurate application model bias and uncertainty, and (c) calculated sensitivities and nuclear data uncertainties can be used for generating conservative estimates of bias for minor actinides and FPs. Results based on the SCALE 6.1 and the ENDF/B-VII.0 cross-section libraries indicate that a conservative estimate of the bias for the minor actinides and FPs is 1.5% of their worth within the application model. Finally, this paper provides a detailed description of the approach and its technical bases, describes the application of the approach for representative pressurized water reactor and boiling water reactor safety analysis models, and provides reference bias results based on the prerelease SCALE 6.1 code package and ENDF/B-VII nuclear cross-section data.","Taylor & Francis - formerly American Nuclear Society (ANS)","","Oak Ridge National Lab.

In previous studies have largely focused on mesophilic microorganisms to remediate cobalt, despite the presence of thermophilic microorganisms at such sites.

Bioreduction experiments were conducted in a growth medium with H<sub>2</sub>/CO<sub>2</sub> as a growth substrate at initial Co(III) concentrations of 1, 2, 4, 7, and 10 mM.

But, at higher concentrations (7 and 10 mM) the reduction extents only reached 69.8% and 48.5%, respectively, likely due to the toxic effect of Co(III) to the methanogen cells as evidenced by a decrease in total cellular protein at these Co(III) concentrations. Methanogenesis was inhibited by Co(III) bioreduction, possibly due to impaired cell growth and electron diversion from CO<sub>2</sub> to Co(III).

The results have showed a strong correlation of annual per capita waste generation rate with number of unemployed women (r = 0.70) and female to male ratio (r = 0.81). This indicates that waste generation rate is more depended on ratio of men and women that on quantitative size of each group. Using the regression analysis a model describing the dependence between female to male ratio, number of unemployed woman and waste quantity was determined. The model explains 70% of waste quantity variation. Obtained results can be used both to improve waste management and to a fuller understanding of gender behavior.","","Available from http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.wasman.2015.03.020","","","","United States","2015-06-15T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: Waste Management; Journal Volume: 40; Other Information: Copyright (c) 2015 Elsevier Science B.V., Amsterdam, The Netherlands, All rights reserved.; Country of input: International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA)","","Medium: X; Size: page(s) 3-8","","","","Journal ID: ISSN 0956-053X; CODEN: WAMAE2; PII: S0956-053X(15)00212-3; TRN: US16R2219042324","10.1016/J.WASMAN.2015.03.020","","2016-05-09T00:00:00Z","22472510","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/22472510","","Waste Management","","40"
"Privatization of solid waste collection services: Lessons from Gaborone","Bolaane, Benjamin; Isaac, Emmanuel","12 MANAGEMENT OF RADIOACTIVE WASTES, AND NON-RADIOACTIVE WASTES FROM NUCLEAR FACILITIES; COMPARATIVE EVALUATIONS; CONTRACTS; DEVELOPING COUNTRIES; EFFICIENCY; SOLID WASTES; WASTE MANAGEMENT","Highlights: • We compared efficiency and effectiveness of waste collection by the public and private sector. • Public sector performs better than private sector in some areas and vice versa. • Outsourcing waste collection in developing countries is hindered by limited capacity on contractual issues. • Outsourcing collection in developing countries is hampered by inadequate waste information. • There is need to build capacity in the public sector of developing countries to support outsourcing. - Abstract: Formal privatization of solid waste collection activities has often been flagged as a suitable intervention for some of the challenges of solid waste management experienced by developing countries. Proponents of outsourcing collection to the private sector argue that in contrast to the public sector, it is more effective and efficient in delivering services. This essay is a comparative case study of efficiency and effectiveness attributes between the public and the formal private sector, in relation to the collection of commercial waste in Gaborone. The paper is based on analysis of secondary data and key informant interviews. It was found that while, the private sector performed comparatively well in most of the chosen indicators of efficiency and effectiveness, the public sector also had areas where it had a competitive advantage. For instance, the private sector used the collection crew more efficiently, while the public sector was found to have a more reliable workforce. The study recommends that, while formal private sector participation in waste collection has some positive effects in terms of quality of service rendered, in most developing countries, it has to be enhanced by building sufficient capacity within the public sector on information about services contracted out and evaluation of performance criteria within the contracting process.","","Available from http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.wasman.2015.03.004","","","","United States","2015-06-15T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: Waste Management; Journal Volume: 40; Other Information: Copyright (c) 2015 Elsevier Science B.V., Amsterdam, The Netherlands, All rights reserved.; Country of input: International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA)","","Medium: X; Size: page(s) 14-21","","","","Journal ID: ISSN 0956-053X; CODEN: WAMAE2; PII: S0956-053X(15)00144-0; TRN: US16R2220042325","10.1016/J.WASMAN.2015.03.004","","2016-05-09T00:00:00Z","22472511","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/22472511","","Waste Management","","40"

The present study aims to evaluate pools of organic matter decomposing under aerobic and anaerobic conditions using landfill simulation reactors (LSR) filled with 40 year old waste from a former MSW landfill. The LSR were operated for 27 months, whereby the waste in one pair was kept under anaerobic conditions and the four other LSRs were aerated. Two of the aerated LSR were run with leachate recirculation and water addition and two without. The organic carbon in the solid waste was characterized at the beginning and at the end of the experiments and major carbon flows (e.g. TOC in leachate, gaseous CO{sub 2} and CH{sub 4}) were monitored during operation. After the termination of the experiments, the waste from the anaerobic LSRs exhibited a long-term gas production potential of more than 20 NL kg{sup −1} dry waste, which corresponded to the mineralization of around 12% of the initial TOC (67 g kg{sup −1} dry waste). Compared to that, aeration led to threefold decrease in TOC (32–36% of the initial TOC were mineralized), without apparent differences in carbon discharge between the aerobic set ups with and without water addition. Based on the investigation of the carbon pools it could be demonstrated that a bit more than 10% of the initially present organic carbon was transformed into more recalcitrant forms, presumably due to the formation of humic substances. The source of anaerobic degradation could be identified mainly as cellulose which played a minor role during aerobic degradation in the experiment.","","Available from http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.wasman.2015.03.011","","","","United States","2015-06-15T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: Waste Management; Journal Volume: 40; Other Information: Copyright (c) 2015 Elsevier Science B.V., Amsterdam, The Netherlands, All rights reserved.; Country of input: International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA)","","Medium: X; Size: page(s) 100-111","","","","Journal ID: ISSN 0956-053X; CODEN: WAMAE2; PII: S0956-053X(15)00152-X; TRN: US16R2224042329","10.1016/J.WASMAN.2015.03.011","","2016-05-09T00:00:00Z","22472515","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/22472515","","Waste Management","","40"

The recovery of copper was achieved in an original set-up consisting of a three chamber electrochemical reactor (ER) connected in series with a chemical reactor (CR) equipped with a perforated rotating drum. Several experiments were performed in order to identify the optimal flow rate for the dissolution of copper in the CR and to ensure the lowest energy consumption for copper electrodeposition in the ER. The optimal hydrodynamic conditions were provided at 400 mL/min, leading to the 75% dissolution of metals and to a low specific energy consumption of 1.59 kW h/kg Cu for the electrodeposition process.

The feasibility of the allocation of MSW material recovery facilities (MRF) as intermediate points between the generators of these wastes and the options for reuse and disposal was evaluated, as well as the participation of associations and cooperatives of waste pickers. This network was mathematically modelled and validated through a scenario analysis of the municipality of São Mateus, which makes the location model more complete and applicable in practice. The mathematical model allows the determination of the number of facilities required for the reverse logistics network, their location, capacities, and product flows between these facilities. The fixed costs of installation and operation of the proposed MRF were balanced with the reduction of transport costs, allowing the inclusion of waste pickers to the reverse logistics network. The main contribution of this study lies in the proposition of a reverse logistics network for MSW simultaneously involving legal, environmental, economic and social criteria, which is a very complex goal. This study can guide practices in other countries that have realities similar to those in Brazil of accelerated urbanisation without adequate planning for solid waste management, added to the strong presence of waste pickers that, through the characteristic of social vulnerability, must be included in the system. In addition to the theoretical contribution to the reverse logistics network problem, this study aids in decision-making for public managers who have limited technical and administrative capacities for the management of solid wastes.","","Available from http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.wasman.2015.02.036","","","","United States","2015-06-15T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: Waste Management; Journal Volume: 40; Other Information: Copyright (c) 2015 Elsevier Science B.V., Amsterdam, The Netherlands, All rights reserved.; Country of input: International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA)","","Medium: X; Size: page(s) 173-191","","","","Journal ID: ISSN 0956-053X; CODEN: WAMAE2; PII: S0956-053X(15)00139-7; TRN: US16R2228042333","10.1016/J.WASMAN.2015.02.036","","2016-05-09T00:00:00Z","22472519","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/22472519","","Waste Management","","40"

The aim of the LCA study is to evaluate direct and indirect emissions resulting from various treatment options of municipal solid waste (MSW) annually generated on site together with avoided emissions resulting from energy, materials and nutrients recovery. IWMSs are modelled using GaBi v6.0 Product Sustainability software and results are presented based on the CML (v.Nov-10) characterisation method. The results show that IWMSs with advanced thermal treatment (ATT) and incineration with energy recovery have the lowest Global Warming Potential (GWP) than IWMSs where landfill is the primary waste treatment process. This is due to higher direct emissions and lower avoided emissions from the landfill process compared to the emissions from the thermal treatment processes. LCA results demonstrate that significant environmental savings are achieved through substitution of virgin materials with recycled ones. The results of the sensitivity analysis carried out for IWMS 1 shows that increasing recycling rate by 5%, 10% and 15% compared to the baseline scenario can reduce GWP by 8%, 17% and 25% respectively. Sensitivity analysis also shows how changes in waste composition affect the overall result of the system. The outcomes of such assessments provide decision-makers with fundamental information regarding the environmental impacts of different waste treatment options necessary for sustainable waste management planning.","","Available from http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.wasman.2015.03.017","","","","United States","2015-06-15T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: Waste Management; Journal Volume: 40; Other Information: Copyright (c) 2015 Elsevier Science B.V., Amsterdam, The Netherlands, All rights reserved.; Country of input: International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA)","","Medium: X; Size: page(s) 157-166","","","","Journal ID: ISSN 0956-053X; CODEN: WAMAE2; PII: S0956-053X(15)00202-0; TRN: US16R2227042332","10.1016/J.WASMAN.2015.03.017","","2016-05-09T00:00:00Z","22472518","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/22472518","","Waste Management","","40"

Two econometric approaches are applied. The first approach is a fixed effects model, while the second is a Stochastic Frontier Analysis (SFA) with fixed effects model. The advantage of the first approach is the ability of controlling for stable time invariant characteristics of the municipalities, thereby eliminating potentially large sources of bias. The second approach is applied in order to estimate the technical efficiency and rank of each municipality accordingly. The regressions control for various demographic, economic and recycling services, such as income per capita, population density, unemployment, trash services, Pay-as-you-throw (PAYT) program and meteorological data. The findings support that a negative relationship between particulate particles in the air 2.5 μm or less in size (PM{sub 2.5}) and recycling rate is presented. In addition, the pollution is increased with increases on income per capita up to $23,000–$26,000, while after this point income contributes positively on air quality. Finally, based on the efficiency derived by the Stochastic Frontier Analysis (SFA) model, the municipalities which provide both drop off and curbside services for trash, food and yard waste and the PAYT program present better performance regarding the air quality.","","Available from http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.wasman.2015.03.006","","","","United States","2015-06-15T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: Waste Management; Journal Volume: 40; Other Information: Copyright (c) 2015 Elsevier Science B.V., Amsterdam, The Netherlands, All rights reserved.; Country of input: International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA)","","Medium: X; Size: page(s) 192-203","","","","Journal ID: ISSN 0956-053X; CODEN: WAMAE2; PII: S0956-053X(15)00147-6; TRN: US16R2229042334","10.1016/J.WASMAN.2015.03.006","","2016-05-09T00:00:00Z","22472520","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/22472520","","Waste Management","","40"

The method uses regularly available statistics on import, industrial production and export of batteries and battery-containing electric and electronic equipment (EEE). To promote method use by other scholars with no access to such data, several empirically results and their trends over time, for different types of batteries occurrence among the EEE types are provided. The information provided by the method can be used to: identify drivers of battery consumption; study the dynamic behavior of battery flows – due to technology development, policies, consumers behavior and infrastructures. The method is exemplified by the study of battery flows in Sweden for years 1996–2013. The batteries were accounted, both in units and weight, as primary and secondary batteries; loose and integrated; by electrochemical composition and share of battery use between different types of EEE. Results show that, despite a fivefold increase in the consumption of rechargeable batteries, they account for only about 14% of total use of portable batteries. Recent increase in digital convergence has resulted in a sharp decline in the consumption of primary batteries, which has now stabilized at a fairly low level. Conversely, the consumption of integrated batteries has increased sharply. In 2013, 61% of the total weight of batteries sold in Sweden was collected, and for the particular case of alkaline manganese dioxide batteries, the value achieved 74%.","","Available from http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.wasman.2015.02.008","","","","United States","2015-05-15T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: Waste Management; Journal Volume: 39; Other Information: Copyright (c) 2015 Elsevier Science B.V., Amsterdam, The Netherlands, All rights reserved.; Country of input: International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA)","","Medium: X; Size: page(s) 236-245","","","","Journal ID: ISSN 0956-053X; CODEN: WAMAE2; PII: S0956-053X(15)00091-4; TRN: US16R2213042323","10.1016/J.WASMAN.2015.02.008","","2016-05-09T00:00:00Z","22472509","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/22472509","","Waste Management","","39"

It is difficult to carry out the reliable estimates using the existing models due to the limited data available in the developing countries. This study aims to forecast MSW collected in Thailand with prediction interval in long term period by using the optimized multivariate grey model which is the mathematical approach. For multivariate models, the representative factors of residential and commercial sectors affecting waste collected are identified, classified and quantified based on statistics and mathematics of grey system theory. Results show that GMC (1, 5), the grey model with convolution integral, is the most accurate with the least error of 1.16% MAPE. MSW collected would increase 1.40% per year from 43,435–44,994 tonnes per day in 2013 to 55,177–56,735 tonnes per day in 2030. This model also illustrates that population density is the most important factor affecting MSW collected, followed by urbanization, proportion employment and household size, respectively. These mean that the representative factors of commercial sector may affect more MSW collected than that of residential sector. Results can help decision makers to develop the measures and policies of waste management in long term period.","","Available from http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.wasman.2015.01.026","","","","United States","2015-05-15T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: Waste Management; Journal Volume: 39; Other Information: Copyright (c) 2015 Elsevier Science B.V., Amsterdam, The Netherlands, All rights reserved.; Country of input: International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA)","","Medium: X; Size: page(s) 3-14","","","","Journal ID: ISSN 0956-053X; CODEN: WAMAE2; PII: S0956-053X(15)00065-3; TRN: US16R2204040018","10.1016/J.WASMAN.2015.01.026","","2016-05-02T00:00:00Z","22470233","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/22470233","","Waste Management","","39"

The Toxicity Characteristic Leaching Procedure (TCLP) was performed on 23 disposable e-cigarettes in a preliminary survey of metal leaching. Based on these results, four e-cigarette products were selected for replicate analysis by TCLP and the California Waste Extraction Test (WET). Lead was measured in leachate as high as 50 mg/L by WET and 40 mg/L by TCLP. Regulatory thresholds were exceeded by two of 15 products tested in total. Therefore, some e-cigarettes would be toxicity characteristic (TC) hazardous waste but a majority would not. When disposed in the unused form, e-cigarettes containing nicotine juice would be commercial chemical products (CCP) and would, in the United States (US), be considered a listed hazardous waste (P075). While household waste is exempt from hazardous waste regulation, there are many instances in which such waste would be subject to regulation. Manufactures and retailers with unused or expired e-cigarettes or nicotine juice solution would be required to manage these as hazardous waste upon disposal. Current regulations and policies regarding the availability of nicotine-containing e-cigarettes worldwide were reviewed. Despite their small size, disposable e-cigarettes are consumed and discarded much more quickly than typical electronics, which may become a growing concern for waste managers.","","Available from http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.wasman.2015.02.005","","","","United States","2015-05-15T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: Waste Management; Journal Volume: 39; Other Information: Copyright (c) 2015 Elsevier Science B.V., Amsterdam, The Netherlands, All rights reserved.; Country of input: International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA)","","Medium: X; Size: page(s) 57-62","","","","Journal ID: ISSN 0956-053X; CODEN: WAMAE2; PII: S0956-053X(15)00088-4; TRN: US16R2206040020","10.1016/J.WASMAN.2015.02.005","","2016-05-02T00:00:00Z","22470235","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/22470235","","Waste Management","","39"

This paper presents the results of comprehensive testing of shear strength properties of mechanically biologically treated municipal solid waste (MBT-MSW) in laboratory. Changes in shear strength of MSW as a function of unit weight and particle size were investigated by performing laboratory studies on the MSW collected from Mavallipura landfill site in Bangalore. Direct shear tests, small scale and large scale consolidated undrained and drained triaxial tests were conducted on reconstituted compost reject MSW samples. The triaxial test results showed that the MSW samples exhibited a strain-hardening behaviour and the strength of MSW increased with increase in unit weight. Consolidated drained tests showed that the mobilized shear strength of the MSW increased by 40% for a unit weight increase from 7.3 kN/m{sup 3} to 10.3 kN/m{sup 3} at 20% strain levels. The mobilized cohesion and friction angle ranged from 5 to 9 kPa and 8° to 33° corresponding to a strain level of 20%. The consolidated undrained tests exhibited reduced friction angle values compared to the consolidated drained tests. The friction angle increased with increase in the unit weight from 8° to 55° in the consolidated undrained tests. Minor variations were found in the cohesion values. Relationships for strength and stiffness of MSW in terms of strength and stiffness ratios are developed and discussed. The stiffness ratio and the strength ratio of MSW were found to be 10 and 0.43.","","Available from http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.wasman.2015.02.013","","","","United States","2015-05-15T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: Waste Management; Journal Volume: 39; Other Information: Copyright (c) 2015 Elsevier Science B.V., Amsterdam, The Netherlands, All rights reserved.; Country of input: International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA)","","Medium: X; Size: page(s) 63-70","","","","Journal ID: ISSN 0956-053X; CODEN: WAMAE2; PII: S0956-053X(15)00096-3; TRN: US16R2207040021","10.1016/J.WASMAN.2015.02.013","","2016-05-02T00:00:00Z","22470236","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/22470236","","Waste Management","","39"

Due to differences in the isotopic composition of carbon from different sources, an analysis of stable carbon isotopes in the groundwater, together with the Keeling plot approach and a two-component mixing model allow us to evaluate the relative contributions of carbon from these sources in the groundwater. In the natural (background) groundwater, DIC concentrations and the isotopic composition of DIC (δ{sup 13}C{sub DIC}) comes from two sources: decomposition of organic matter and carbonate dissolution within the aquifer sediments, whereas in the leachate-contaminated groundwater, DIC concentrations and δ{sup 13}C{sub DIC} values depend on the degradation of organic matter within the aquifer sediments and biodegradation of organic matter stored in the landfill. From the mixing model, about 4–54% of the DIC pool is derived from organic matter degradation and 96–46% from carbonate dissolution in natural conditions. In the leachate-contaminated groundwater, about 20–53% of the DIC is derived from organic matter degradation of natural origin and 80–47% from biodegradation of organic matter stored in the landfill. Partial pressure of CO{sub 2} (P CO{sub 2}) was generally above the atmospheric, hence atmospheric CO{sub 2} as a source of carbon in DIC pool was negligible in the aquifer. P CO{sub 2} values in the aquifer in Otwock were always one to two orders of magnitude above the atmospheric P CO{sub 2}, and thus CO{sub 2} escaped directly into the vadose zone.","","Available from http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.wasman.2015.01.044","","","","United States","2015-05-15T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: Waste Management; Journal Volume: 39; Other Information: Copyright (c) 2015 Elsevier Science B.V., Amsterdam, The Netherlands, All rights reserved.; Country of input: International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA)","","Medium: X; Size: page(s) 216-225","","","","Journal ID: ISSN 0956-053X; CODEN: WAMAE2; PII: S0956-053X(15)00084-7; TRN: US16R2211040025","10.1016/J.WASMAN.2015.01.044","","2016-05-02T00:00:00Z","22470240","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/22470240","","Waste Management","","39"

Cathode Ray Tubes (CRTs) from used television and computer screens represent one of the main sources of e-waste. CRTs contain toxic materials such as lead, cadmium, barium, and fluorescent powders which can be released if recycling of CRTs is not appropriate. Exposure to these harmful substances was assessed in nine workshops where CRT screens are treated. Particulate exposure levels were measured using a gravimetric method and metals were analysed by plasma emission spectrometry. The maximum levels of worker exposure were 8.8 mg/m{sup 3}, 1504.3 μg/m{sup 3}, 434.9 μg/m{sup 3}, 576.3 μg/m{sup 3} and 2894.3 μg/m{sup 3} respectively for inhalable dust, barium, cadmium, lead and yttrium. The maximum levels of airborne pollutants in static samples were 39.0 mg/m{sup 3}, 848.2 μg/m{sup 3}, 698.4 μg/m{sup 3}, 549.3 μg/m{sup 3} and 3437.9 μg/m{sup 3} for inhalable dust, barium, cadmium, lead and yttrium. The most harmful operations were identified, and preventive measures for reducing the chemical risk associated with screen recycling were proposed. Workplace measurements were used to define recommendations for reducing the chemical risks in CRT screens recycling facilities and for promoting the design and development of “clean and safe” processes in emerging recycling channels.","","Available from http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.wasman.2015.02.027","","","","United States","2015-05-15T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: Waste Management; Journal Volume: 39; Other Information: Copyright (c) 2015 Elsevier Science B.V., Amsterdam, The Netherlands, All rights reserved.; Country of input: International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA)","","Medium: X; Size: page(s) 226-235","","","","Journal ID: ISSN 0956-053X; CODEN: WAMAE2; PII: S0956-053X(15)00130-0; TRN: US16R2212040026","10.1016/J.WASMAN.2015.02.027","","2016-05-02T00:00:00Z","22470241","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/22470241","","Waste Management","","39"

We also conducted a field survey of waste batteries collected at various battery and small waste electric and electronic equipment (WEEE) collection sites in Tokyo. The different types of batteries are not collected in a uniform way in the Tokyo area, so consumers need to pay attention to the specific collection rules for each type of battery in each municipality. In areas where small WEEE recycling schemes are being operated after the enforcement of the Act on Promotion of Recycling of Small Waste Electrical and Electronic Equipment in Japan in 2013, consumers may be confused about the need for separating batteries from small WEEE (especially mobile phones). Our field survey of collected waste batteries indicated that 6–10% of zinc carbon and alkaline batteries discarded in Japan currently could be regarded as containing mercury. More than 26% of zinc carbon dry batteries currently being discarded may have a lead content above the labelling threshold of the EU Batteries Directive (2006/66/EC). In terms of safety, despite announcements by producers and municipalities about using insulation (tape) on waste batteries to prevent fires, only 2.0% of discarded cylindrical dry batteries were insulated. Our field study of small WEEE showed that batteries made up an average of 4.6% of the total collected small WEEE on a weight basis. Exchangeable batteries were used in almost all of mobile phones, digital cameras, radios, and remote controls, but the removal rate was as low as 22% for mobile phones. Given the safety issues and the rapid changes occurring with mobile phones or other types of small WEEE, discussion is needed among stakeholders to determine how to safely collect and recycle WEEE and waste batteries.","","Available from http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.wasman.2015.01.038","","","","United States","2015-05-15T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: Waste Management; Journal Volume: 39; Other Information: Copyright (c) 2015 Elsevier Science B.V., Amsterdam, The Netherlands, All rights reserved.; Country of input: International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA)","","Medium: X; Size: page(s) 246-257","","","","Journal ID: ISSN 0956-053X; CODEN: WAMAE2; PII: S0956-053X(15)00077-X; TRN: US16R2214040027","10.1016/J.WASMAN.2015.01.038","","2016-05-02T00:00:00Z","22470242","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/22470242","","Waste Management","","39"

The implementation of these waste-to-energy (WTE) projects would lead to the improvement of campus sustainability by minimizing waste management efforts and reducing GHG emissions via the displacement of fossil fuel usage. Technical and economic aspects of their implementation were assessed and the corresponding GHG reduction was estimated. Results showed that on-site implementation of these projects would: (1) divert 3682 L (974 gallons) of waste cooking oil to 3712 L (982 gallons) of biodiesel; (2) produce 138 tonnes of fuel pellets from 133 tonnes of waste paper (with the addition of 20.75 tonnes of plastics) to replace121 tonnes of coal; and (3) produce biogas that would be enough to replace 12,767 m{sup 3} natural gas every year from 146 tonnes of food waste. The economic analysis determined that the payback periods for the three projects would be 16 months for the biodiesel, 155 months for the fuel pellet, and 74 months for the biogas projects. The reduction of GHG emission from the implementation of the three WTE projects was determined to be 9.37 (biodiesel), 260.49 (fuel pellets), and 11.36 (biogas) tonnes of CO{sub 2}-eq per year, respectively.","","Available from http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.wasman.2015.01.016","","","","United States","2015-05-15T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: Waste Management; Journal Volume: 39; Other Information: Copyright (c) 2015 Elsevier Science B.V., Amsterdam, The Netherlands, All rights reserved.; Country of input: International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA)","","Medium: X; Size: page(s) 258-265","","","","Journal ID: ISSN 0956-053X; CODEN: WAMAE2; PII: S0956-053X(15)00053-7; TRN: US16R2215040028","10.1016/J.WASMAN.2015.01.016","","2016-05-02T00:00:00Z","22470243","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/22470243","","Waste Management","","39"

Past research has predominantly focused on recycling, whilst interactions between changing waste destinies, causes and drivers of household waste management change, and potential consequences for the goal of the waste hierarchy are less well understood. This study analysed Local Authority Collected Waste (LACW) for England, at national, regional and sub-regional level, in terms of the destination of household waste to landfill, incineration and recycling. Information about waste partnerships, waste management infrastructure and collection systems was collected to help identify and explain changes in waste destinies. Since 1996, the proportion of waste landfilled in England has decreased, in tandem with increases in recycling and incineration. At the regional and sub-regional (Local Authority; LA) level, there have been large variations in the relative proportions of waste landfilled, incinerated and recycled or composted. Annual increases in the proportion of household waste incinerated were typically larger than increases in the proportion recycled. The observed changes took place in the context of legal and financial drivers, and the circumstances of individual LAs (e.g. landfill capacity) also explained the changes seen. Where observed, shifts from landfill towards incineration constitute an approach whereby waste management moves up the waste hierarchy as opposed to an attempt to reach the most preferred option(s); in terms of resource efficiency, this practice is sub-optimal. The requirement to supply incinerators with a feedstock over their lifespan reduces the benefits of developing of recycling and waste reduction, although access to incineration infrastructure permits short-term and marked decreases in the proportion of LACW landfilled. We conclude that there is a need for clearer national strategy and co-ordination to inform and guide policy, practice, planning and investment in infrastructure such that waste management can be better aligned with the principles of the circular economy and resource efficiency. If the ongoing stand-off between national political figures and the waste sector continues, England’s waste policy remains destined for indecision.","","Available from http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.wasman.2015.02.023","","","","United States","2015-05-15T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: Waste Management; Journal Volume: 39; Other Information: Copyright (c) 2015 Elsevier Science B.V., Amsterdam, The Netherlands, All rights reserved.; Country of input: International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA)","","Medium: X; Size: page(s) 266-276","","","","Journal ID: ISSN 0956-053X; CODEN: WAMAE2; PII: S0956-053X(15)00125-7; TRN: US16R2216040029","10.1016/J.WASMAN.2015.02.023","","2016-05-02T00:00:00Z","22470244","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/22470244","","Waste Management","","39"

Moreover, municipal waste services have typically been provided through natural or legal monopolies, where few incentives exist to reduce costs. It is thus vital to examine empirically the cost structure of these services in order to develop effective public policies which can make these services more cost efficient. Accordingly, this paper considers economies of size and economies of output density in the municipal waste collection sector in the New South Wales (NSW) local government system in an effort to identify the optimal size of utilities from the perspective of cost efficiency. Our results show that – as presently constituted – NSW municipal waste services are not efficient in terms of costs, thereby demonstrating that ‘bigger is not better.’ The optimal size of waste utilities is estimated to fall in the range 12,000–20,000 inhabitants. However, significant economies of output density for unsorted (residual) municipal waste collection and recycling waste collection were found, which means it is advantageous to increase the amount of waste collected, but maintaining constant the number of customers and the intervention area.","","Available from http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.wasman.2015.01.024","","","","United States","2015-05-15T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: Waste Management; Journal Volume: 39; Other Information: Copyright (c) 2015 Elsevier Science B.V., Amsterdam, The Netherlands, All rights reserved.; Country of input: International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA)","","Medium: X; Size: page(s) 277-286","","","","Journal ID: ISSN 0956-053X; CODEN: WAMAE2; PII: S0956-053X(15)00063-X; TRN: US16R2217040030","10.1016/J.WASMAN.2015.01.024","","2016-05-02T00:00:00Z","22470245","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/22470245","","Waste Management","","39"

Accurate quantification of the waste to be generated is essential for both the daily management (short-term) and proper design of facilities (long-term). Designing without rigorous knowledge may have serious economic and environmental consequences. The present works aims at identifying relevant socio-economic features of municipalities regarding Household Waste (HW) generation by means of factor models. Factor models face two main drawbacks, data collection and identifying relevant explanatory variables within a heterogeneous group. Grouping similar characteristics observations within a group may favour the deduction of more robust models. The methodology followed has been tested with Biscay Province because it stands out for having very different municipalities ranging from very rural to urban ones. Two main models are developed, one for the overall province and a second one after clustering the municipalities. The results prove that relating municipalities with specific characteristics, improves the results in a very heterogeneous situation. The methodology has identified urban morphology, tourism activity, level of education and economic situation as the most influencing characteristics in HW generation.","","Available from http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.wasman.2015.02.017","","","","United States","2015-05-15T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: Waste Management; Journal Volume: 39; Other Information: Copyright (c) 2015 Elsevier Science B.V., Amsterdam, The Netherlands, All rights reserved.; Country of input: International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA)","","Medium: X; Size: page(s) 26-34","","","","Journal ID: ISSN 0956-053X; CODEN: WAMAE2; PII: S0956-053X(15)00100-2; TRN: US16R2205040019","10.1016/J.WASMAN.2015.02.017","","2016-05-02T00:00:00Z","22470234","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/22470234","","Waste Management","","39"

Laboratory studies showed that when simulated caustic tank wastes contact subsurface sediments, mineral dissolution and precipitation result in feldspathoid formation. Feldspathoids are environmentally important for waste management and disposal purposes because of their purported potential to sequester contaminants of interest (e.g., <sup>99</sup>TcO<sub>4</sub><sup>-</sup>, <sup>137</sup>Cs<sup>+</sup>, <sup>90</sup>Sr<sup>2+</sup>) into their structure. In this paper, we investigated the incorporation of perrhenate (ReO<sub>4</sub><sup>-</sup>), a surrogate for TcO<sub>4</sub><sup>-</sup>, in the presence of competing anions (X) including OH<sup>-</sup>, NO<sub>2</sub><sup>-</sup>, NO<sub>3</sub><sup>-</sup> and Cl<sup>-</sup> on feldspathoid formation and under conditions mimicking tank waste solution compositions. The resulting solids were characterized by their chemical composition, structure and morphology. Regardless of solution pH, sodalite formed in the presence of Cl<sup>-</sup> and NO<sub>2</sub><sup>-</sup> whereas NO<sub>3</sub><sup>-</sup> promoted either cancrinite formation in 16-mol OH<sup>-</sup>/kg (16 m) or mixed sodalite/cancrinite phases in 1-mol OH<sup>-</sup>/kg (1 m) solutions. In the presence of Cl<sup>-</sup>, NO<sub>2</sub><sup>-</sup>, and NO<sub>3</sub><sup>-</sup> less than 0.02 mol fraction of ReO<sub>4</sub><sup>-</sup> was incorporated into the feldspathoid phase(s).

"Toward understanding the effect of low-activity waste glass composition on sulfur solubility","Vienna, John D.; Kim, Dong -Sang; Muller, Isabelle S.; Piepel, Greg F.; Kruger, Albert A.; Jantzen, C.","12 MANAGEMENT OF RADIOACTIVE AND NON-RADIOACTIVE WASTES FROM NUCLEAR FACILITIES","The concentration of sulfur in nuclear waste glass melter feed must be maintained below the point where salt accumulates on the melt surface. The allowable concentrations may range from 0.37 to over 2.05 weight percent (of SO<sub>3</sub> on a calcined oxide basis) depending on the composition of the melter feed and processing conditions. If the amount of sulfur exceeds the melt tolerance level, a molten salt will accumulate, which may upset melter operations and potentially shorten the useful life of the melter. At the Hanford site, relatively conservative limits have been placed on sulfur loading in melter feed, which in turn significantly increases the amount of glass that will be produced. Crucible-scale sulfur solubility data and scaled melter sulfur tolerance data have been collected on simulated Hanford waste glasses over the last 15 years. These data were compiled and analyzed. A model was developed to predict the solubility of SO<sub>3</sub> in glass based on 252 simulated Hanford low-activity waste (LAW) glass compositions. This model represents the data well, accounting for over 85% of the variation in data, and was well validated. The model was also found to accurately predict the tolerance for sulfur in melter feed for 13 scaled melter tests of simulated LAW glasses. The model can be used to help estimate glass volumes and make informed decisions on process options. The model also gives quantitative estimates of component concentration effects on sulfur solubility. The components that most increase sulfur solubility are Li<sub>2</sub>O > V<sub>2</sub>O<sub>5</sub>> CaO ≈ P<sub>2</sub>O<sub>5</sub> > Na<sub>2</sub>O ≈ B<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub> > K<sub>2</sub>O. The components that most decrease sulfur solubility are Cl > Cr<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub> > Al<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub> > ZrO<sub>2</sub> ≈ SnO<sub>2</sub> > Others ≈ SiO<sub>2</sub>. As a result, the order of component effects is similar to previous literature data, in most cases.","American Ceramic Society","","Hanford Site (HNF), Richland, WA (United States)","USDOE Office of Environmental Management (EM)","Pacific Northwest National Laboratory; The Catholic University of America; Department of Energy - Office of River Protection","United States","2014-07-24T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: Journal of the American Ceramic Society; Journal Volume: 97; Journal Issue: 10","","Medium: ED; Size: p. 3135-3142","","ORP-56664 Rev.0","AC05-76RL01830","Journal ID: ISSN 0002-7820; TRN: US1600480","10.1111/jace.13125","","2021-07-19T00:00:00Z","1123706","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/1123706","https://www.osti.gov/servlets/purl/1123706","Journal of the American Ceramic Society","10","97"

One of the most important recommendations made by IAEA is to perform multistage processes aiming at declassification of the waste. At this moment, approximately 3000 bottles of mixed liquid waste, with estimated volume of 6000 litres are currently stored at the National Radioactive Waste Management Centre, Malaysia and some have been stored for more than 25 years. The aim of this study is to develop a characterization protocol towards reclassification of these wastes. The characterization protocol entails waste identification, waste screening and segregation, and analytical radionuclides profiling using various analytical procedures including gross alpha/ gross beta, gamma spectrometry, and LSC method.

Manufacturers must take responsibility for their products over the entire life cycle. In this context, there is a need for network design methods for effectively managing recovery operations and waste. The purpose of this study is to develop a mathematical programming model for managing reverse flows in end-of-life vehicles’ recovery network. A reverse flow is the collection of used products from consumers and the transportation of these products for the purpose of recycling, reuse or disposal. The proposed model includes all operations in a product recovery and waste management network for used vehicles and reuse for vehicle parts such as collection, disassembly, refurbishing, processing (shredding), recycling, disposal and reuse of vehicle parts. The scope of the network model is to determine the numbers and locations of facilities in the network and the material flows between these facilities. The results show the performance of the model and its applicability for use in the planning of recovery operations in the automotive industry. The main objective of recovery and waste management is to maximize revenue and minimize pollution in end-of-life product operations. This study shows that with an accurate model, these activities may provide economic benefits and incentives in addition to protecting the environment.","","Available from http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.wasman.2015.01.007","","","","United States","2015-04-15T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: Waste Management; Journal Volume: 38; Other Information: Copyright (c) 2015 Elsevier Science B.V., Amsterdam, The Netherlands, All rights reserved.; Country of input: International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA)","","Medium: X; Size: page(s) 284-296","","","","Journal ID: ISSN 0956-053X; CODEN: WAMAE2; PII: S0956-053X(15)00044-6; TRN: US16R2194042321","10.1016/J.WASMAN.2015.01.007","","2016-05-09T00:00:00Z","22472507","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/22472507","","Waste Management","","38"

In the present study, supercritical carbon dioxide (SC-CO{sub 2}) was applied to inactivate gram-positive Staphylococcus aureus, Enterococcus faecalis, Bacillus subtilis, and gram-negative Escherichia coli in CSW. The effects of SC-CO{sub 2} sterilization parameters such as pressure, temperature, and time were investigated and optimized by response surface methodology (RSM). Results showed that the data were adequately fitted into the second-order polynomial model. The linear quadratic terms and interaction between pressure and temperature had significant effects on the inactivation of S. aureus, E. coli, E. faecalis, and B. subtilis in CSW. Optimum conditions for the complete inactivation of bacteria within the experimental range of the studied variables were 20 MPa, 60 °C, and 60 min. The SC-CO{sub 2}-treated bacterial cells, observed under a scanning electron microscope, showed morphological changes, including cell breakage and dislodged cell walls, which could have caused the inactivation. This espouses the inference that SC-CO{sub 2} exerts strong inactivating effects on the bacteria present in CSW, and has the potential to be used in CSW management for the safe handling and recycling-reuse of CSW materials.","","Available from http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.wasman.2015.01.003","","","","United States","2015-04-15T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: Waste Management; Journal Volume: 38; Other Information: Copyright (c) 2015 Elsevier Science B.V., Amsterdam, The Netherlands, All rights reserved.; Country of input: International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA)","","Medium: X; Size: page(s) 462-473","","","","Journal ID: ISSN 0956-053X; CODEN: WAMAE2; PII: S0956-053X(15)00037-9; TRN: US16R2201042322","10.1016/J.WASMAN.2015.01.003","","2016-05-09T00:00:00Z","22472508","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/22472508","","Waste Management","","38"

On the other hand, the sustainable recycling of spent lithium-ion batteries may bring about environmental and economic benefits. In this study, a hydrometallurgical process was adopted for the comprehensive recovery of nickel, manganese, cobalt and lithium from sulfuric acid leaching liquor from waste cathode materials of spent lithium-ion batteries. First, nickel ions were selectively precipitated and recovered using dimethylglyoxime reagent. Recycled dimethylglyoxime could be re-used as precipitant for nickel and revealed similar precipitation performance compared with fresh dimethylglyoxime. Then the separation of manganese and cobalt was conducted by solvent extraction method using cobalt loaded D2EHPA. And McCabe–Thiele isotherm was employed for the prediction of the degree of separation and the number of extraction stages needed at specific experimental conditions. Finally, cobalt and lithium were sequentially precipitated and recovered as CoC{sub 2}O{sub 4}⋅2H{sub 2}O and Li{sub 2}CO{sub 3} using ammonium oxalate solution and saturated sodium carbonate solution, respectively. Recovery efficiencies could be attained as follows: 98.7% for Ni; 97.1% for Mn, 98.2% for Co and 81.0% for Li under optimized experimental conditions.

The seven waste management scenarios included traditional waste handling methods (e.g. recycle and landfill) and management of the waste stream via composting, including purchasing where only compostable food service items were used during the events. Waste audits were conducted at four Arizona State University (ASU) baseball games, including a three game series. The findings demonstrate a tradeoff among CO{sub 2} equivalent emissions, energy use, and landfill diversion rates. Of the seven waste management scenarios assessed, the recycling scenarios provide the greatest reductions in CO{sub 2} eq. emissions and energy use because of the retention of high value materials but are compounded by the difficulty in managing a two or three bin collection system. The compost only scenario achieves complete landfill diversion but does not perform as well with respect to CO{sub 2} eq. emissions or energy. The three game series was used to test the impact of staffed bins on contamination rates; the first game served as a baseline, the second game employed staffed bins, and the third game had non staffed bins to determine the effect of staffing on contamination rates. Contamination rates in both the recycling and compost bins were tracked throughout the series. Contamination rates were reduced from 34% in the first game to 11% on the second night (with the staffed bins) and 23% contamination rates at the third game.","","Available from http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.wasman.2015.01.019","","","","United States","2015-04-15T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: Waste Management; Journal Volume: 38; Other Information: Copyright (c) 2015 Elsevier Science B.V., Amsterdam, The Netherlands, All rights reserved.; Country of input: International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA)","","Medium: X; Size: page(s) 86-94","","","","Journal ID: ISSN 0956-053X; CODEN: WAMAE2; PII: S0956-053X(15)00056-2; TRN: US16R2187042320","10.1016/J.WASMAN.2015.01.019","","2016-05-09T00:00:00Z","22472506","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/22472506","","Waste Management","","38"

The analysis is based on a case study focussed on envelopes for postal and courier services provided with these intelligent systems. The smart printed envelope of the study includes a combination of both conventional (thin flexible batteries and resistors) and printed electronic components (conductive track layout based on nanosilver ink). For this purpose, a comparison between envelopes with and without these components (batteries, resistors and conductive track layouts) was carried out through pilot scale paper recycling tests. The generation of rejects during the recycling process as well as the final quality of the recycled paper (mechanical and optical properties) were tested and quantitatively evaluated. The results show that resistors are retained during the screening process in the sieves and consequently they cannot end up in the final screened pulp. Therefore, mechanical and optical properties of the recycled paper are not affected. Nevertheless, inks from the conductive track layouts and batteries were partially dissolved in the process water. These substances were not totally retained in the sieving systems resulting in slight changes in the optical properties of the final recycled paper (variations are 7.2–7.5% in brightness, 8.5–10.7% in whiteness, 1.2–2.2% in L{sup ∗} values, 3.3–3.5% in opacity and 16.1–27% in yellowness). These variations are not in ranges able to cause problems in current paper recycling processes and restrict the use of recycled paper in current applications. Moreover, real impacts on industrial recycling are expected to be even significantly lower since the proportion of paper product with printed circuits in the current paper waste streams are much lower than the ones tested in this work. However, it should be underlined the fact that this situation may change over the next years due to the future developments in printed electronics and the gradual penetration of these types of devices in the market.","","Available from http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.wasman.2015.01.005","","","","United States","2015-04-15T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: Waste Management; Journal Volume: 38; Other Information: Copyright (c) 2015 Elsevier Science B.V., Amsterdam, The Netherlands, All rights reserved.; Country of input: International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA)","","Medium: X; Size: page(s) 41-48","","","","Journal ID: ISSN 0956-053X; CODEN: WAMAE2; PII: S0956-053X(15)00039-2; TRN: US16R2186040004","10.1016/J.WASMAN.2015.01.005","","2016-05-02T00:00:00Z","22470219","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/22470219","","Waste Management","","38"

Seven different types of soils and coal fly ashes were tested. Results of this study indicated that Ca, Cd, Mg, and Sr showed cationic leaching pattern while As and Se generally follows an oxyanionic leaching pattern. On the other hand, leaching of Ba presented amphoteric-like leaching pattern but less pH-dependent. In spite of different types and composition of soil and coal fly ash investigated, the study reveals the similarity in leaching behavior as a function of pH for a given element from soil, coal fly ash, and soil-coal fly ash mixtures. The similarity is most likely due to similar controlling mechanisms (e.g., solubility, sorption, and solid-solution formation) and similar controlling factors (e.g., leachate pH and redox conditions). This offers the opportunity to transfer knowledge of coal fly ash that has been extensively characterized and studied to soil stabilized with coal fly ash. It is speculated that unburned carbon in off-specification coal fly ashes may provide sorption sites for Cd resulting in a reduction in concentration of these elements in leachate from soil-coal fly ash mixture. Class C fly ash provides sufficient CaO to initiate the pozzolanic reaction yielding hydrated cement products that oxyanions, including As and Se, can be incorporated into.","","Available from http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.wasman.2014.11.018","","","","United States","2015-04-15T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: Waste Management; Journal Volume: 38; Other Information: Copyright (c) 2014 Elsevier Science B.V., Amsterdam, The Netherlands, All rights reserved.; Country of input: International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA)","","Medium: X; Size: page(s) 174-184","","","","Journal ID: ISSN 0956-053X; CODEN: WAMAE2; PII: S0956-053X(14)00568-6; TRN: US16R2191040008","10.1016/J.WASMAN.2014.11.018","","2016-05-02T00:00:00Z","22470223","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/22470223","","Waste Management","","38"

In the study, they were mixed and vitrified into the slag by the melt-quench process. The obtained vitrified slag was then mixed with various percentages of oil shale fly ash and converted into glass ceramic composites by the subsequent sintering process. Differential thermal analysis was used to study the thermal characteristics and determine the sintering temperatures. X-ray diffraction analysis was used to analyze the crystalline phase compositions. Sintering shrinkage, weight loss on ignition, density and compressive strength were tested to determine the optimum preparation condition and study the co-sintering mechanism of vitrified amorphous slag and oil shale fly ash. The results showed the product performances increased with the increase of sintering temperatures and the proportion of vitrified slag to oil shale fly ash. Glass ceramic composite (vitrified slag content of 80%, oil shale fly ash content of 20%, sintering temperature of 1000 °C and sintering time of 2 h) showed the properties of density of 1.92 ± 0.05 g/cm{sup 3}, weight loss on ignition of 6.14 ± 0.18%, sintering shrinkage of 22.06 ± 0.6% and compressive strength of 67 ± 14 MPa. The results indicated that it was a comparable waste-based material compared to previous researches. In particular, the energy consumption in the production process was reduced compared to conventional vitrification and sintering method. Chemical resistance and heavy metals leaching results of glass ceramic composites further confirmed the possibility of its engineering applications.","","Available from http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.wasman.2014.12.028","","","","United States","2015-04-15T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: Waste Management; Journal Volume: 38; Other Information: Copyright (c) 2015 Elsevier Science B.V., Amsterdam, The Netherlands, All rights reserved.; Country of input: International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA)","","Medium: X; Size: page(s) 185-193","","","","Journal ID: ISSN 0956-053X; CODEN: WAMAE2; PII: S0956-053X(15)00010-0; TRN: US16R2192040009","10.1016/J.WASMAN.2014.12.028","","2016-05-02T00:00:00Z","22470224","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/22470224","","Waste Management","","38"

E-waste recycling with an end-life disposal scenario is environmentally beneficial because of the low environmental burden generated from human toxicity, terrestrial ecotoxicity, freshwater ecotoxicity, and marine ecotoxicity categories. Landfill and incineration technologies have a lower and higher environmental burden than the e-waste recycling with an end-life disposal scenario, respectively. The key factors in reducing the overall environmental impact of e-waste recycling are optimizing energy consumption efficiency, reducing wastewater and solid waste effluent, increasing proper e-waste treatment amount, avoiding e-waste disposal to landfill and incineration sites, and clearly defining the duties of all stakeholders (e.g., manufacturers, retailers, recycling companies, and consumers)","","Available from http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.wasman.2014.12.022","","","","United States","2015-04-15T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: Waste Management; Journal Volume: 38; Other Information: Copyright (c) 2015 Elsevier Science B.V., Amsterdam, The Netherlands, All rights reserved.; Country of input: International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA)","","Medium: X; Size: page(s) 357-365","","","","Journal ID: ISSN 0956-053X; CODEN: WAMAE2; PII: S0956-053X(15)00003-3; TRN: US16R2197040012","10.1016/J.WASMAN.2014.12.022","","2016-05-02T00:00:00Z","22470227","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/22470227","","Waste Management","","38"

Despite the fact that several examples (e.g., Agostini et al., 2007; Hamer and Karius, 2002; Xu et al., 2014) show that this application is feasible, some economic, technical and social limitations interfere with the development of a market of dredged materials in brick production in Flanders. While we describe the main characteristics of the supply side, we focus on the limitations and barriers from the demand side in the present study. Based on a consumers survey we analyze consumers’ risk perceptions and attitudes towards bricks produced from dredged sediments. Consumers in Flanders are rather suspicious with respect to bricks produced from dredged sediments and their risk perception is mainly determined by the possibility of a bad bargain (brick of inferior quality) and the connotation with chemical contamination. The willingness to pay for bricks made from dredged sediments is mainly influenced by the age of the respondents, as well environmental awareness, and the respondents’ belief in their ability to influence environmental problems. Sensitization and information of customers seems to be of primary importance to make dredged-sediment-derived bricks a successful product.","","Available from http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.wasman.2014.12.025","","","","United States","2015-04-15T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: Waste Management; Journal Volume: 38; Other Information: Copyright (c) 2015 Elsevier Science B.V., Amsterdam, The Netherlands, All rights reserved.; Country of input: International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA)","","Medium: X; Size: page(s) 372-380","","","","Journal ID: ISSN 0956-053X; CODEN: WAMAE2; PII: S0956-053X(15)00006-9; TRN: US16R2198040013","10.1016/J.WASMAN.2014.12.025","","2016-05-02T00:00:00Z","22470228","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/22470228","","Waste Management","","38"

The main purpose was to investigate the effects of ammoniacal nitrogen on the anaerobic digestion process. The two-stage system gave more reliable operation compared to one-stage due to: (i) a better pH self-adjusting capacity; (ii) a higher resistance to organic loading shocks; and (iii) a higher conversion rate of organic substrate to biomethane. Also a small amount of biohydrogen was detected from the first stage of the two-stage reactor making this system attractive for biohythane production. As the digestate contains ammoniacal nitrogen, re-circulating it provided the necessary alkalinity in the systems, thus preventing an eventual failure by volatile fatty acids (VFA) accumulation. However, re-circulation also resulted in an ammonium accumulation, yielding a lower biomethane production. Based on the batch experimental results the 50% inhibitory concentration of total ammoniacal nitrogen on the methanogenic activities was calculated as 3.8 g/L, corresponding to 146 mg/L free ammonia for the inoculum used for this research. The two-stage system was affected by the inhibition more than the one-stage system, as it requires less alkalinity and the physically separated methanogens are more sensitive to inhibitory factors, such as ammonium and propionic acid.","","Available from http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.wasman.2014.12.001","","","","United States","2015-04-15T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: Waste Management; Journal Volume: 38; Other Information: Copyright (c) 2014 Elsevier Science B.V., Amsterdam, The Netherlands, All rights reserved.; Country of input: International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA)","","Medium: X; Size: page(s) 388-398","","","","Journal ID: ISSN 0956-053X; CODEN: WAMAE2; PII: S0956-053X(14)00578-9; TRN: US16R2199040014","10.1016/J.WASMAN.2014.12.001","","2016-05-02T00:00:00Z","22470229","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/22470229","","Waste Management","","38"

Life cycle assessment (LCA) is a holistic methodology allowing for the analysis of systems and products and can be applied to waste management systems to identify environmental benefits and critical aspects thereof. From an LCA perspective, residue utilisation provides benefits such as avoiding the production and depletion of primary materials, but it can lead to environmental burdens, due to the potential leaching of toxic substances. In waste LCA studies where residue utilisation is included, leaching has generally been neglected. In this study, municipal solid waste incineration bottom ash (MSWI BA) was used as a case study into three LCA scenarios having different system boundaries. The importance of data quality and parameter selection in the overall LCA results was evaluated, and an innovative method to assess metal transport into the environment was applied, in order to determine emissions to the soil and water compartments for use in an LCA. It was found that toxic impacts as a result of leaching were dominant in systems including only MSWI BA utilisation, while leaching appeared negligible in larger scenarios including the entire waste system. However, leaching could not be disregarded a priori, due to large uncertainties characterising other activities in the scenario (e.g. electricity production). Based on the analysis of relevant parameters relative to leaching, and on general results of the study, recommendations are provided regarding the use of leaching data in LCA studies.","","Available from http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.wasman.2014.12.018","","","","United States","2015-04-15T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: Waste Management; Journal Volume: 38; Other Information: Copyright (c) 2014 Elsevier Science B.V., Amsterdam, The Netherlands, All rights reserved.; Country of input: International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA)","","Medium: X; Size: page(s) 474-485","","","","Journal ID: ISSN 0956-053X; CODEN: WAMAE2; PII: S0956-053X(14)00595-9; TRN: US16R2202040016","10.1016/J.WASMAN.2014.12.018","","2016-05-02T00:00:00Z","22470231","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/22470231","","Waste Management","","38"

An improved understanding of contaminant transport process in wastes is required for developing better predictions about potential length of the long term aftercare of landfills, currently measured in timescales of centuries. Three tracers (lithium, bromide and deuterium) were used. Lithium did not behave conservatively. Given that lithium has been used extensively for tracing in landfill wastes, the tracer itself and the findings of previous tests which assume that it has behaved conservatively may need revisiting. The smaller column test could not be fitted with continuum models, probably because the volume of waste was below a representative elemental volume. Modelling compared advection-dispersion (AD), dual porosity (DP) and hybrid AD–DP models. Of these models, the DP model was found to be the most suitable. Although there is good evidence to suggest that diffusion is an important transport mechanism, the breakthrough curves of the different tracers did not differ from each other as would be predicted based on the free-water diffusion coefficients. This suggested that solute diffusion in wastes requires further study.","","Available from http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.wasman.2014.12.012","","","","United States","2015-04-15T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: Waste Management; Journal Volume: 38; Other Information: Copyright (c) 2014 Elsevier Science B.V., Amsterdam, The Netherlands, All rights reserved.; Country of input: International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA)","","Medium: X; Size: page(s) 250-262","","","","Journal ID: ISSN 0956-053X; CODEN: WAMAE2; PII: S0956-053X(14)00589-3; TRN: US16R2193040010","10.1016/J.WASMAN.2014.12.012","","2016-05-02T00:00:00Z","22470225","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/22470225","","Waste Management","","38"

The model renders it possible to apply different optimization objectives such as minimizing costs or greenhouse gas emissions or to prioritize several objectives given different weights. A simple illustrative case is analysed, covering alternative treatments of one tonne of residual household waste: incineration of the full amount or sorting out organic waste for biogas production for either combined heat and power generation or as fuel in vehicles. The case study illustrates that the optimal solution depends on the objective and assumptions regarding the background system – illustrated with different assumptions regarding displaced electricity production.

But in most of the cases the amount of available real defects is not sufficient to evaluate the system. Model-assisted and transfer functions are one way to handle that challenge. This study is focused on a combination of different data pools to create a sufficient amount of data for the reliability estimation. A widespread approach for calculating the Probability of Detection (POD) was used on a radiographic testing (RT) method. The highest contrast to noise ratio (CNR) of each indication is usually selected as the signal in the 'â vs. a' (signal-response) approach for RT. By combining real and artificial defects (flat bottom holes, side drill holes, flat bottom squares, notches, etc) in RT the highest signals are close to each other, but the process of creating and evaluating real defects is much more complex. The solution is seen in the combination of real and artificial data using a weighted least square approach. The weights for real or artificial data were based on the importance, the value and the different detection behavior of the different data. For comparison, the alternative combination through the Bayesian Updating was also applied. As verification, a data pool with a large amount of real data was available. In an advanced approach for evaluating the digital RT data, the size of the indication (perpendicular to the X-ray beam) was introduced as additional information. The signal now consists of the CNR and the area of the indication. The detectability is changing depending on the area of the indication, a fact that was ignored in the previous POD calculations for RT. This points out that a weighted least square approach to pool the data might no longer be adequate. The Bayesian Updating of the estimated parameters of the relationship between the signal field (the area of the indication) and the geometry of the defects is seen as the appropriate model to combine the different defect types in a useful and meaningful way. This work was carried out together with the Finnish company for spent nuclear fuel and waste management - Posiva Oy. The digital RT is one of the NDT methods that might be used for the inspection of the weld of the copper canister to be used for the spent nuclear fuel in the Scandinavian concept of final disposal.","","","","","","United States","2015-03-31T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","Conference","Journal Name: AIP Conference Proceedings; Journal Volume: 1650; Journal Issue: 1; Conference: 41.

In this work, the interactions between cationic resins in the Na{sup +} form and tricalcium silicate are investigated during the early stages of hydration in order to gain a better understanding of the expansion process. It is shown that the IERs exhibit a transient swelling of small magnitude due to the decrease in the osmotic pressure of the external solution. This expansion, which occurs just after setting, is sufficient to damage the material which is poorly consolidated for several reasons: low degree of hydration, precipitation of poorly cohesive sodium-bearing C–S–H, and very heterogeneous microstructure with zones of high porosity.","","Available from http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.cemconres.2014.12.009","","","","United States","2015-03-15T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: Cement and Concrete Research; Journal Volume: 69; Other Information: Copyright (c) 2015 Elsevier Science B.V., Amsterdam, The Netherlands, All rights reserved.; Country of input: International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA)","","Medium: X; Size: page(s) 61-71","","","","Journal ID: ISSN 0008-8846; CODEN: CCNRAI; PII: S0008-8846(14)00251-8; TRN: US16R0688045310","10.1016/J.CEMCONRES.2014.12.009","","2016-05-11T00:00:00Z","22475495","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/22475495","","Cement and Concrete Research","","69"

The amounts of tritium penetrated into or released from cement paste with epoxy and urethane paint coatings were measured. The tritium penetration amounts were increased with the HTO (tritiated water) exposure time. Time to achieve a saturated value of tritium sorption was more than 60 days for cement paste coated with epoxy paint and with urethane paint, while that for cement paste without any paint coating took 2 days to achieve it. The effect of tritium permeation reduction by the epoxy paint was higher than that of the urethane. Although their paint coatings were effective for reduction of tritium penetration through the cement paste which was exposed to HTO for a short period, it was found that the amount of tritium trapped in the paints became large for a long period. Tritium penetration rates were estimated by an analysis of one-dimensional diffusion in the axial direction of a thickness of a sample. Obtained data were helpful for evaluation of tritium contamination and decontamination.

A new calorimeter has been developed by SETARAM Instrumentation and the CEA Valduc in France. This new calorimeter is designed for drums having a volume bigger than 100 liters. It guarantees high operator safety by optimizing drum handling and air circulation for cooling, and optimized software for direct measurement of the quantity of nuclear material. The LVC1380 calorimeter makes it possible to work over the range 10 to 3000 mW, which corresponds to approximately 0.03 to 10 g of tritium or 3 to 955 g of {sup 241}Pu in a volume up to 385 liters. This calorimeter is based on the heat flow measurement using Peltier elements which surround the drum in the 3 dimensions and therefore measure all the heat coming from the radioactive stuff whatever its position inside the drum. Calorimeter's insulating layers constitute a thermal barrier designed to filter disturbances until they represent less than 0.001 Celsius degrees and to eliminate long term disturbances associated, for example, with laboratory temperature variations between day and night. A calibration device based on Joule effect has also been designed. Measurement time has been optimized but remains long compared with other methods of measurement such as gamma spectrometry but its main asset is to have a good accuracy for low level activities.","","Available from doi: http://dx.doi.org/10.13182/FST14-T36","","","","United States","2015-03-15T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","Conference","Journal Name: Fusion Science and Technology; Journal Volume: 67; Journal Issue: 2; Conference: TRITIUM 2013: 10.

The management of tritiated waste implies limitations in terms of activity and tritium degassing. The degassing tritium can be under the form of tritiated hydrogen, tritiated water and, in some specific cases, negligible amount of tritiated volatile organic compound. Hence, considering the major forms of degassing tritium, CEA has developed a mixed-compound dedicated to tritium trapping in drums. Based on several experiments, the foreseen mixed compound is composed of MnO{sub 2}, Ag{sub 2}O, Pt and molecular sieve, the three first species having the ability to convert tritiated hydrogen into tritiated water and the last one acting as a trap for tritiated water. To assess the performance of the trapping mixture, experimental tests were performed at room temperature on tritiated dust composed of beryllium and carbon. It was shown that the metallic oxides mixture used for tritiated hydrogen conversion is efficient and that tritiated water adsorption was limited due to an inefficient regeneration of the molecular sieve prior to its use. Apart from this point, the tritium release from waste was reduced by a factor of 5.5, which can be improved up to 87 if the adsorption step is efficient.","","Available from doi: http://dx.doi.org/10.13182/FST14-T53","","","","United States","2015-03-15T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","Conference","Journal Name: Fusion Science and Technology; Journal Volume: 67; Journal Issue: 2; Conference: TRITIUM 2013: 10.

Many of the waste products contain organic materials which may undergo degradation leading to the release of tritium and carbon-14 species into waste containers and potentially into the environment. Monitoring for radioactive gas releases are required for environmental regulatory compliance and for radiation protection of facility workers. Research is currently being undertaken at the National Physical Laboratory (NPL) as part of a European Metrology Research Programme (EMRP) project MetroRWM to adapt and automate existing environmental sampling techniques for tritium and carbon-14 species. An innovative modular system is being developed which will lead to the introduction of an on-site small scale system capable of gas collection, liquid scintillation sample preparation and measurement. This paper outlines the evaluation of a liquid scintillation system that has been performed to date using active solutions of spiked trapping medium of similar activity concentrations to those anticipated in a waste repository. This system will operate using pre-set conditions for quench and luminescence derived from these and subsequent trials, unlike most other counters for which corrections for these phenomena are applied post measurement.

On recovery of tritiated water vapor in gas streams, it is well-known that the isotope exchange reaction between the gas phase and the liquid phase occurs effectively at room temperature. We have carried out experiments using bubbles to examine the tritium contamination and decontamination of a volume of rotary-vacuum-pump oil. The contamination of the pump oil was made by bubbling tritiated water vapor and tritiated hydrogen gas into the oil. Subsequently the decontamination was processed by bubbling pure water vapor and dry argon gas into the tritiated oil. Results show that the water vapor bubbling was more effective than dry argon gas. The experiment also shows that the water vapor bubbling in an oil bottle can remove and transfer tritium efficiently from the tritiated oil into another water-bubbling bottle.","","Available from doi: http://dx.doi.org/10.13182/FST14-T88","","","","United States","2015-03-15T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","Conference","Journal Name: Fusion Science and Technology; Journal Volume: 67; Journal Issue: 3; Conference: TRITIUM 2013: 10.

The ESIX method involves sequential application of reduction and oxidation potentials to an ion exchange film to induce the respective loading and unloading of cesium. This technology is superior to conventional methods (e.g electrodialysis reversal or reverse osmosis) as it requires very little energy for ionic separation. In previous studies, ESIX films have demonstrated relatively low ion exchange capacities and limited film stabilities over repeated potential applications. In this study, the methodology for the deposition of electro-active films (nickel hexacyanoferrate) on nickel electrodes was modified to improve the ion exchange capacity for cesium removal using ESIX. Cyclic voltammetry was used to investigate the ion exchange capacity and stability. Scanning electron microscopy (SEM) was used to characterize the modified film surfaces. Additionally, the films were examined for the separation of cesium ions. This modified film preparation technique enhanced the ion exchange capacity and improves the film stability compared to previous methods for the deposition of ESIX films.

The higher the material turnover, and the more complex and divers the materials produced, the more challenging it is for waste management to reach the goals of “protection of men and environment” and “resource conservation”. Waste incineration, introduced originally for volume reduction and hygienic reasons, went through a long and intense development. Together with prevention and recycling measures, waste to energy (WTE) facilities contribute significantly to reaching the goals of waste management. Sophisticated air pollution control (APC) devices ensure that emissions are environmentally safe. Incinerators are crucial and unique for the complete destruction of hazardous organic materials, to reduce risks due to pathogenic microorganisms and viruses, and for concentrating valuable as well as toxic metals in certain fractions. Bottom ash and APC residues have become new sources of secondary metals, hence incineration has become a materials recycling facility, too. WTE plants are supporting decisions about waste and environmental management: They can routinely and cost effectively supply information about chemical waste composition as well as about the ratio of biogenic to fossil carbon in MSW and off-gas.","","Available from http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.wasman.2014.02.003","","","","United States","2015-03-15T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: Waste Management; Journal Volume: 37; Other Information: Copyright (c) 2014 Elsevier Science B.V., Amsterdam, The Netherlands, All rights reserved.; Country of input: International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA)","","Medium: X; Size: page(s) 3-12","","","","Journal ID: ISSN 0956-053X; CODEN: WAMAE2; PII: S0956-053X(14)00054-3; TRN: US16R2177039995","10.1016/J.WASMAN.2014.02.003","","2016-05-02T00:00:00Z","22470210","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/22470210","","Waste Management","","37"

This review addresses the state-of-the-art of MSW pyrolysis in regards to its technologies and reactors, products and environmental impacts. In this review, first, the influence of important operating parameters such as final temperature, heating rate (HR) and residence time in the reaction zone on the pyrolysis behaviours and products is reviewed; then the pyrolysis technologies and reactors adopted in literatures and scale-up plants are evaluated. Third, the yields and main properties of the pyrolytic products from individual MSW components, refuse-derived fuel (RDF) made from MSW, and MSW are summarised. In the fourth section, in addition to emissions from pyrolysis processes, such as HCl, SO{sub 2} and NH{sub 3}, contaminants in the products, including PCDD/F and heavy metals, are also reviewed, and available measures for improving the environmental impacts of pyrolysis are surveyed. It can be concluded that the single pyrolysis process is an effective waste-to-energy convertor but is not a guaranteed clean solution for MSW disposal. Based on this information, the prospects of applying pyrolysis technologies to dealing with MSW are evaluated and suggested.","","Available from http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.wasman.2015.01.022","","","","United States","2015-03-15T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: Waste Management; Journal Volume: 37; Other Information: Copyright (c) 2015 Elsevier Science B.V., Amsterdam, The Netherlands, All rights reserved.; Country of input: International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA)","","Medium: X; Size: page(s) 116-136","","","","Journal ID: ISSN 0956-053X; CODEN: WAMAE2; PII: S0956-053X(15)00061-6; TRN: US16R2182040000","10.1016/J.WASMAN.2015.01.022","","2016-05-02T00:00:00Z","22470215","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/22470215","","Waste Management","","37"

This new scheme is considered for a region where bottom ash and incombustibles are landfilled or not allowed to be recycled due to their toxic heavy metal concentration. Waste is processed with incombustible residues and an incineration bottom ash discharged from existent conventional incinerators, using a gasification and melting technology (the Direct Melting System). The inert materials, contained in municipal solid waste, incombustibles and bottom ash, are recycled as slag and metal in this process as well as energy recovery. Based on this new waste management scheme with a co-gasification system, a case study of municipal solid waste co-gasification was evaluated and compared with other technical solutions, such as conventional incineration, incineration with an ash melting facility under certain boundary conditions. From a technical point of view, co-gasification produced high quality slag with few harmful heavy metals, which was recycled completely without requiring any further post-treatment such as aging. As a consequence, the co-gasification system had an economical advantage over other systems because of its material recovery and minimization of the final landfill amount. Sensitivity analyses of landfill cost, power price and inert materials in waste were also conducted. The higher the landfill costs, the greater the advantage of the co-gasification system has. The co-gasification was beneficial for landfill cost in the range of 80 Euro per ton or more. Higher power prices led to lower operation cost in each case. The inert contents in processed waste had a significant influence on the operating cost. These results indicate that co-gasification of bottom ash and incombustibles with municipal solid waste contributes to minimizing the final landfill amount and has great possibilities maximizing material recovery and energy recovery from waste.","","Available from http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.wasman.2014.07.024","","","","United States","2015-03-15T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: Waste Management; Journal Volume: 37; Other Information: Copyright (c) 2014 Elsevier Science B.V., Amsterdam, The Netherlands, All rights reserved.; Country of input: International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA)","","Medium: X; Size: page(s) 137-146","","","","Journal ID: ISSN 0956-053X; CODEN: WAMAE2; PII: S0956-053X(14)00329-8; TRN: US16R2183040001","10.1016/J.WASMAN.2014.07.024","","2016-05-02T00:00:00Z","22470216","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/22470216","","Waste Management","","37"

Waste incineration has attracted the interest of economists in the first place concerning the comparative assessment of waste management options, with particular reference to external costs and benefits. A second important field of applied economic research concerns the market failures associated with the provision of thermal treatment of waste, that justify some deviation from the standard competitive market model. Our analysis discusses the most robust achievements and the more controversial areas. All in all, the economic perspective seems to confirm the desirability of assigning a prominent role to thermal treatments in an integrated waste management strategy. Probably the most interesting original contribution it has to offer concerns the refusal of categorical assumptions and too rigid priority ladders, emphasizing instead the need to consider site-specific circumstances that may favor one or another solution.","","Available from http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.wasman.2014.08.024","","","","United States","2015-03-15T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: Waste Management; Journal Volume: 37; Other Information: Copyright (c) 2014 Elsevier Science B.V., Amsterdam, The Netherlands, All rights reserved.; Country of input: International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA)","","Medium: X; Size: page(s) 45-57","","","","Journal ID: ISSN 0956-053X; CODEN: WAMAE2; PII: S0956-053X(14)00379-1; TRN: US16R2179039997","10.1016/J.WASMAN.2014.08.024","","2016-05-02T00:00:00Z","22470212","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/22470212","","Waste Management","","37"

"Flows of engineered nanomaterials through the recycling process in Switzerland","Caballero-Guzman, Alejandro; Sun, Tianyin; Nowack, Bernd","12 MANAGEMENT OF RADIOACTIVE WASTES, AND NON-RADIOACTIVE WASTES FROM NUCLEAR FACILITIES; 77 NANOSCIENCE AND NANOTECHNOLOGY; MATERIALS RECOVERY; NANOMATERIALS; PLASTICS; PROBABILISTIC ESTIMATION; RECYCLING; RISK ASSESSMENT; SANITARY LANDFILLS; SILVER; SWITZERLAND; TITANIUM OXIDES; TOXICITY; ZINC OXIDES","Highlights: • Recycling is one of the likely end-of-life fates of nanoproducts. • We assessed the material flows of four nanomaterials in the Swiss recycling system. • After recycling, most nanomaterials will flow to landfills or incineration plants. • Recycled construction waste, plastics and textiles may contain nanomaterials. - Abstract: The use of engineered nanomaterials (ENMs) in diverse applications has increased during the last years and this will likely continue in the near future. As the number of applications increase, more and more waste with nanomaterials will be generated. A portion of this waste will enter the recycling system, for example, in electronic products, textiles and construction materials. The fate of these materials during and after the waste management and recycling operations is poorly understood. The aim of this work is to model the flows of nano-TiO{sub 2}, nano-ZnO, nano-Ag and CNT in the recycling system in Switzerland. The basis for this study is published information on the ENMs flows on the Swiss system. We developed a method to assess their flow after recycling. To incorporate the uncertainties inherent to the limited information available, we applied a probabilistic material flow analysis approach. The results show that the recycling processes does not result in significant further propagation of nanomaterials into new products. Instead, the largest proportion will flow as waste that can subsequently be properly handled in incineration plants or landfills. Smaller fractions of ENMs will be eliminated or end up in materials that are sent abroad to undergo further recovery processes. Only a reduced amount of ENMs will flow back to the productive process of the economy in a limited number of sectors. Overall, the results suggest that risk assessment during recycling should focus on occupational exposure, release of ENMs in landfills and incineration plants, and toxicity assessment in a small number of recycled inputs.","","Available from http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.wasman.2014.11.006","","","","United States","2015-02-15T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: Waste Management; Journal Volume: 36; Other Information: Copyright (c) 2014 Elsevier Science B.V., Amsterdam, The Netherlands, All rights reserved.; Country of input: International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA)","","Medium: X; Size: page(s) 33-43","","","","Journal ID: ISSN 0956-053X; CODEN: WAMAE2; PII: S0956-053X(14)00523-6; TRN: US16R2160042317","10.1016/J.WASMAN.2014.11.006","","2016-05-09T00:00:00Z","22472503","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/22472503","","Waste Management","","36"

The described approach allows the examination of samples in regards to the compliance with legal specifications for polybrominated biphenyls (PBBs) and polybrominated diphenyl ethers (PBDEs) directly after disassembling and facilitates the sorting out of plastics with high contents of brominated flame retardants (BFRs). In all, over 3000 pieces of black (TV) and 1600 pieces of grey (PC) plastic waste were analysed with handheld XRF technique for this study. Especially noticeable was the high percentage of pieces with a bromine content of over 50,000 ppm for TV (7%) and PC (39%) waste plastics. The applied method was validated by comparing the data of handheld XRF with results obtained by GC–MS. The results showed the expected and sufficiently accurate correlation between these two methods. It is shown that handheld XRF technique is an effective tool for fast monitoring of large volumes of WEEE plastics in regards to BFRs for on-site measurements.","","Available from http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.wasman.2014.10.025","","","","United States","2015-02-15T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: Waste Management; Journal Volume: 36; Other Information: Copyright (c) 2014 Elsevier Science B.V., Amsterdam, The Netherlands, All rights reserved.; Country of input: International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA)","","Medium: X; Size: page(s) 297-304","","","","Journal ID: ISSN 0956-053X; CODEN: WAMAE2; PII: S0956-053X(14)00509-1; TRN: US16R2172042318","10.1016/J.WASMAN.2014.10.025","","2016-05-09T00:00:00Z","22472504","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/22472504","","Waste Management","","36"

This behavior increases the obsolescence rate of used still-functional products leading to lower profitability that could be resulted out of End-of-Use (EOU) treatments such as reuse, upgrade, and refurbishment. These types of behaviors are influenced by several product and consumer-related factors such as consumers’ traits and lifestyles, technology evolution, product design features, product market value, and pro-environmental stimuli. Better understanding of different groups of consumers, their utilization and storage behavior and the connection of these behaviors with product design features helps Original Equipment Manufacturers (OEMs) and recycling and recovery industry to better overcome the challenges resulting from the undesirable storage of used products. This paper aims at providing insightful statistical analysis of Electronic Waste (e-waste) dynamic nature by studying the effects of design characteristics, brand and consumer type on the electronics usage time and end of use time-in-storage. A database consisting of 10,063 Hard Disk Drives (HDD) of used personal computers returned back to a remanufacturing facility located in Chicago, IL, USA during 2011–2013 has been selected as the base for this study. The results show that commercial consumers have stored computers more than household consumers regardless of brand and capacity factors. Moreover, a heterogeneous storage behavior is observed for different brands of HDDs regardless of capacity and consumer type factors. Finally, the storage behavior trends are projected for short-time forecasting and the storage times are precisely predicted by applying machine learning methods.","","Available from http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.wasman.2014.11.024","","","","United States","2015-02-15T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: Waste Management; Journal Volume: 36; Other Information: Copyright (c) 2014 Elsevier Science B.V., Amsterdam, The Netherlands, All rights reserved.; Country of input: International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA)","","Medium: X; Size: page(s) 305-315","","","","Journal ID: ISSN 0956-053X; CODEN: WAMAE2; PII: S0956-053X(14)00574-1; TRN: US16R2173042319","10.1016/J.WASMAN.2014.11.024","","2016-05-09T00:00:00Z","22472505","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/22472505","","Waste Management","","36"

To design an adequate MSW management plan the first step consists in defining the waste generation and composition patterns of the town. As these patterns depend on several socio-economic factors it is advisable to organize them previously. Moreover, the waste generation and composition patterns may vary around the town and over the time. Generally, the data are not homogeneous around the city as the number of inhabitants is not constant nor it is the economic activity. Therefore, if all the information is showed in thematic maps, the final waste management decisions can be made more efficiently. The main aim of this paper is to present a structured methodology that allows local authorities or private companies who deal with MSW to design its own MSW management plan depending on the available data. According to these data, this paper proposes two ways of action: a direct way when detailed data are available and an indirect way when there is a lack of data and it is necessary to take into account bibliographic data. In any case, the amount of information needed is considerable. This paper combines the planning methodology with the Geographic Information Systems to present the final results in thematic maps that make easier to interpret them. The proposed methodology is a previous useful tool to organize the MSW collection routes including the selective collection. To verify the methodology it has been successfully applied to a Spanish town.","","Available from http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.wasman.2014.11.008","","","","United States","2015-02-15T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: Waste Management; Journal Volume: 36; Other Information: Copyright (c) 2014 Elsevier Science B.V., Amsterdam, The Netherlands, All rights reserved.; Country of input: International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA)","","Medium: X; Size: page(s) 1-11","","","","Journal ID: ISSN 0956-053X; CODEN: WAMAE2; PII: S0956-053X(14)00525-X; TRN: US16R2158039981","10.1016/J.WASMAN.2014.11.008","","2016-05-02T00:00:00Z","22470196","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/22470196","","Waste Management","","36"

In addition, it is also focused on identifying the most effective way of transmitting environmental information to parents and children to promote the collection of electrical and electronic toys at their end-of-life. The study was implemented in a Spanish municipality. With regard to the consumption habits, aspects related to the amount of toys that children receive annually and percentage of those which are electrical and electronic toys have been obtained and classified according to the family size. Results from Chi-squared analysis and Ordinal Logistic Regression show that there is a statistically significance relationship among these variables. Regarding disposal habits, aspects related to the reasons and way for discarding electrical and electronic toys, time that toys are kept at home or the willingness to rent or buy second hand e-toys have been obtained. What really attracts attention is that, apart from consumers who donate the toy to family or social associations, 67.1% of consumers discard them along with other waste fractions in domestic bins, whereas only 32.9% do so at recycling points, as Directive 2012/19/EU requires. To increase this percentage, three environmental education actions (distinguishing from each other by the way used to transmit the environmental information: paper, audiovisual or personal communication) have been designed, applied and evaluated their efficiency according to the amount of waste toys collected.","","Available from http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.wasman.2014.10.022","","","","United States","2015-02-15T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: Waste Management; Journal Volume: 36; Other Information: Copyright (c) 2014 Elsevier Science B.V., Amsterdam, The Netherlands, All rights reserved.; Country of input: International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA)","","Medium: X; Size: page(s) 277-288","","","","Journal ID: ISSN 0956-053X; CODEN: WAMAE2; PII: S0956-053X(14)00506-6; TRN: US16R2170039990","10.1016/J.WASMAN.2014.10.022","","2016-05-02T00:00:00Z","22470205","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/22470205","","Waste Management","","36"

Due to their mercury content end-of-life fluorescent lamps are classified as hazardous waste, requiring special treatment for disposal. A simple wet-based decontamination process is required, especially for streams where thermal desorption, a commonly used but energy demanding method, cannot be applied. In this study the potential of a wet-based process using iodine in potassium iodide solution was studied for the recovery of mercury from fluorescent lamp waste. The influence of the leaching agent’s concentration and solid/liquid ratio on the decontamination efficiency was investigated. The leaching behaviour of mercury was studied over time, as well as its recovery from the obtained leachates by means of anion exchange, reduction, and solvent extraction. Dissolution of more than 90% of the contained mercury was achieved using 0.025/0.05 M I{sub 2}/KI solution at 21 °C for two hours. The efficiency of the process increased with an increase in leachant concentration. 97.3 ± 0.6% of the mercury contained was dissolved at 21 °C, in two hours, using a 0.25/0.5 M I{sub 2}/KI solution and a solid to liquid ratio of 10% w/v. Iodine and mercury can be efficiently removed from the leachates using Dowex 1X8 anion exchange resin or reducing agents such as sodium hydrosulphite, allowing the disposal of the obtained solution as non-hazardous industrial wastewater. The extractant CyMe{sub 4}BTBP showed good removal of mercury, with an extraction efficiency of 97.5 ± 0.7% being achieved in a single stage. Better removal of mercury was achieved in a single stage using the extractants Cyanex 302 and Cyanex 923 in kerosene, respectively.","","Available from http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.wasman.2014.10.023","","","","United States","2015-02-15T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: Waste Management; Journal Volume: 36; Other Information: Copyright (c) 2014 Elsevier Science B.V., Amsterdam, The Netherlands, All rights reserved.; Country of input: International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA)","","Medium: X; Size: page(s) 289-296","","","","Journal ID: ISSN 0956-053X; CODEN: WAMAE2; PII: S0956-053X(14)00507-8; TRN: US16R2171039991","10.1016/J.WASMAN.2014.10.023","","2016-05-02T00:00:00Z","22470206","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/22470206","","Waste Management","","36"

Citizens’ collaboration is partly based on understanding their views and their active involvement in MSW planning; on the other hand the assessment of the perception of hazardousness related with MSW is considered rather important as well since the identification of the weak points of the applied MWM strategy is eased and the level of required training is determined. Researchers implemented a case study in the West Bank (WB) and Gaza Strip (GS) regions of Palestine, taking into consideration previous researches in other developing countries. They reached to safe and useful conclusions regarding the parameters which mean the greatest in the waste management field as far as DC are concerned. Lack of skilled manpower, irregular collection services, inadequate equipment used for waste collection, inadequate legal provisions, and resource constraints are additional factors that are confirmed to be challenging the waste management scenarios in all DCs today. The research takes those factors under consideration but focuses on the educational gap and the results revealed interesting trends a significant relationship between respondent’s educational attainment and their awareness of hazardous waste (hazard perception); the results will indicate the measure taking required to avoid accidents occurred in those regions (burns from toxics, cuts from sharps, etc). National policy and legislation development based on the research outcomes will ensure equitable and accessible services are in place in order to move towards a healthier environment.

SEA in waste management planning has become a tool for considering the benefits and consequences of the proposed changes in space, also taking into account the capacity of space to sustain the implementation of the planned activities. In order to envisage both the positive and negative implications of a waste management plan for the elements of sustainable development, an adequate methodological approach to evaluating the potential impacts must be adopted and the evaluation results presented in a simple and clear way, so as to allow planners to make relevant decisions as a precondition for the sustainability of the activities planned in the waste management sector. This paper examines the multi-criteria evaluation method for carrying out an SEA for the Waste Management Plan for the city of Belgrade (BWMP). The method was applied to the evaluation of the impacts of the activities planned in the waste management sector on the basis of the environmental and socioeconomic indicators of sustainability, taking into consideration the intensity, spatial extent, probability and frequency of impact, by means of a specific planning approach and simple and clear presentation of the obtained results.","","Available from http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.wasman.2014.11.003","","","","United States","2015-02-15T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: Waste Management; Journal Volume: 36; Other Information: Copyright (c) 2014 Elsevier Science B.V., Amsterdam, The Netherlands, All rights reserved.; Country of input: International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA)","","Medium: X; Size: page(s) 331-342","","","","Journal ID: ISSN 0956-053X; CODEN: WAMAE2; PII: S0956-053X(14)00519-4; TRN: US16R2175039993","10.1016/J.WASMAN.2014.11.003","","2016-05-02T00:00:00Z","22470208","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/22470208","","Waste Management","","36"
"Life cycle costing of waste management systems: Overview, calculation principles and case studies","Martinez-Sanchez, Veronica; Kromann, Mikkel A.; Astrup, Thomas Fruergaard","09 BIOMASS FUELS; 12 MANAGEMENT OF RADIOACTIVE WASTES, AND NON-RADIOACTIVE WASTES FROM NUCLEAR FACILITIES; COMBUSTION; DIGESTION; ENVIRONMENTAL IMPACTS; EXTERNAL COST; FINANCIAL INCENTIVES; HOUSEHOLDS; LIFE CYCLE ASSESSMENT; LIFE-CYCLE COST; ORGANIC WASTES; PRICES; SOLID WASTES; WASTE MANAGEMENT","Highlights: • We propose a comprehensive model for cost assessment of waste management systems. • The model includes three types of LCC: Conventional, Environmental and Societal LCCs. • The applicability of the proposed model is tested with two case studies. - Abstract: This paper provides a detailed and comprehensive cost model for the economic assessment of solid waste management systems. The model was based on the principles of Life Cycle Costing (LCC) and followed a bottom-up calculation approach providing detailed cost items for all key technologies within modern waste systems. All technologies were defined per tonne of waste input, and each cost item within a technology was characterised by both a technical and an economic parameter (for example amount and cost of fuel related to waste collection), to ensure transparency, applicability and reproducibility. Cost items were classified as: (1) budget costs, (2) transfers (for example taxes, subsidies and fees) and (3) externality costs (for example damage or abatement costs related to emissions and disamenities). Technology costs were obtained as the sum of all cost items (of the same type) within a specific technology, while scenario costs were the sum of all technologies involved in a scenario. The cost model allows for the completion of three types of LCC: a Conventional LCC, for the assessment of financial costs, an Environmental LCC, for the assessment of financial costs whose results are complemented by a Life Cycle Assessment (LCA) for the same system, and a Societal LCC, for socio-economic assessments. Conventional and Environmental LCCs includes budget costs and transfers, while Societal LCCs includes budget and externality costs. Critical aspects were found in the existing literature regarding the cost assessment of waste management, namely system boundary equivalency, accounting for temporally distributed emissions and impacts, inclusions of transfers, the internalisation of environmental impacts and the coverage of shadow prices, and there was also significant confusion regarding terminology. The presented cost model was implemented in two case study scenarios assessing the costs involved in the source segregation of organic waste from 100,000 Danish households and the subsequent co-digestion of organic waste with animal manure. Overall, source segregation resulted in higher financial costs than the alternative of incinerating the organic waste with the residual waste: 1.6 M€/year, of which 0.9 M€/year was costs for extra bins and bags used by the households, 1.0 M€/year for extra collections and −0.3 M€/year saved on incineration.","","Available from http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.wasman.2014.10.033","","","","United States","2015-02-15T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: Waste Management; Journal Volume: 36; Other Information: Copyright (c) 2014 Elsevier Science B.V., Amsterdam, The Netherlands, All rights reserved.; Country of input: International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA)","","Medium: X; Size: page(s) 343-355","","","","Journal ID: ISSN 0956-053X; CODEN: WAMAE2; PII: S0956-053X(14)00522-4; TRN: US16R2176039994","10.1016/J.WASMAN.2014.10.033","","2016-05-02T00:00:00Z","22470209","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/22470209","","Waste Management","","36"

The mass distribution of pyrolysis was also reported. The results showed that PS generated the most total PAH, followed by PVC, PET, and lignin. More PAH were detected from the pyrolysis of plastics than the pyrolysis of biomass. In the biomass group, lignin generated more PAH than others. Naphthalene was the most abundant PAH, and the amount of 1-methynaphthalene and 2-methynaphthalene was also notable. Phenanthrene and fluorene were the most abundant 3-ring PAH, while benzo[a]anthracene and chrysene were notable in the tar of PS, PVC, and PET. 2-ring PAH dominated all tar samples, and varied from 40 wt.% to 70 wt.%. For PS, PET and lignin, PAH may be generated directly from the aromatic structure of the feedstock.","","Available from http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.wasman.2014.09.014","","","","United States","2015-02-15T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: Waste Management; Journal Volume: 36; Other Information: Copyright (c) 2014 Elsevier Science B.V., Amsterdam, The Netherlands, All rights reserved.; Country of input: International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA)","","Medium: X; Size: page(s) 136-146","","","","Journal ID: ISSN 0956-053X; CODEN: WAMAE2; PII: S0956-053X(14)00436-X; TRN: US16R2165045815","10.1016/J.WASMAN.2014.09.014","","2016-05-11T00:00:00Z","22476000","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/22476000","","Waste Management","","36"

In the absence of standardised and commonly accepted waste characterisation methodologies, various approaches have been reported in literature. This limits both comparability and applicability of the results. In this study, a waste sampling and sorting methodology for efficient and statistically robust characterisation of solid waste was introduced. The methodology was applied to residual waste collected from 1442 households distributed among 10 individual sub-areas in three Danish municipalities (both single and multi-family house areas). In total 17 tonnes of waste were sorted into 10–50 waste fractions, organised according to a three-level (tiered approach) facilitating comparison of the waste data between individual sub-areas with different fractionation (waste from one municipality was sorted at “Level III”, e.g. detailed, while the two others were sorted only at “Level I”). The results showed that residual household waste mainly contained food waste (42 ± 5%, mass per wet basis) and miscellaneous combustibles (18 ± 3%, mass per wet basis). The residual household waste generation rate in the study areas was 3–4 kg per person per week. Statistical analyses revealed that the waste composition was independent of variations in the waste generation rate. Both, waste composition and waste generation rates were statistically similar for each of the three municipalities. While the waste generation rates were similar for each of the two housing types (single-family and multi-family house areas), the individual percentage composition of food waste, paper, and glass was significantly different between the housing types. This indicates that housing type is a critical stratification parameter. Separating food leftovers from food packaging during manual sorting of the sampled waste did not have significant influence on the proportions of food waste and packaging materials, indicating that this step may not be required.","","Available from http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.wasman.2014.11.009","","","","United States","2015-02-15T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: Waste Management; Journal Volume: 36; Other Information: Copyright (c) 2014 Elsevier Science B.V., Amsterdam, The Netherlands, All rights reserved.; Country of input: International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA)","","Medium: X; Size: page(s) 12-23","","","","Journal ID: ISSN 0956-053X; CODEN: WAMAE2; PII: S0956-053X(14)00526-1; TRN: US16R2159039982","10.1016/J.WASMAN.2014.11.009","","2016-05-02T00:00:00Z","22470197","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/22470197","","Waste Management","","36"

An automated system that can quickly categorize these materials is certainly needed for obtaining maximum classification while maintaining high throughput. In this paper, first of all, the photographs of the plastic bottles have been taken and several preprocessing steps were carried out. The first preprocessing step is to extract the plastic area of a bottle from the background. Then, the morphological image operations are implemented. These operations are edge detection, noise removal, hole removing, image enhancement, and image segmentation. These morphological operations can be generally defined in terms of the combinations of erosion and dilation. The effect of bottle color as well as label are eliminated using these operations. Secondly, the pixel-wise intensity values of the plastic bottle images have been used together with the most popular subspace and statistical feature extraction methods to construct the feature vectors in this study. Only three types of plastics are considered due to higher existence ratio of them than the other plastic types in the world. The decision mechanism consists of five different feature extraction methods including as Principal Component Analysis (PCA), Kernel PCA (KPCA), Fisher’s Linear Discriminant Analysis (FLDA), Singular Value Decomposition (SVD) and Laplacian Eigenmaps (LEMAP) and uses a simple experimental setup with a camera and homogenous backlighting. Due to the giving global solution for a classification problem, Support Vector Machine (SVM) is selected to achieve the classification task and majority voting technique is used as the decision mechanism. This technique equally weights each classification result and assigns the given plastic object to the class that the most classification results agree on. The proposed classification scheme provides high accuracy rate, and also it is able to run in real-time applications. It can automatically classify the plastic bottle types with approximately 90% recognition accuracy. Besides this, the proposed methodology yields approximately 96% classification rate for the separation of PET or non-PET plastic types. It also gives 92% accuracy for the categorization of non-PET plastic types into HPDE or PP.","","Available from http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.wasman.2014.09.030","","","","United States","2015-01-15T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: Waste Management; Journal Volume: 35; Other Information: Copyright (c) 2014 Elsevier Science B.V., Amsterdam, The Netherlands, All rights reserved.; Country of input: International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA)","","Medium: X; Size: page(s) 29-35","","","","Journal ID: ISSN 0956-053X; CODEN: WAMAE2; PII: S0956-053X(14)00452-8; TRN: US15R3216013138","10.1016/J.WASMAN.2014.09.030","","2016-03-10T00:00:00Z","22443597","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/22443597","","Waste Management","","35"

With the consistent growth of plastic consumption, more and more plastic waste is generated. Considering the stable chemical and physics characteristics of plastic, regular waste management methods are not suitable for recycling economic strategy of each government, which has become a serious environmental problem. Recycling plastic waste is considered to be the best way to treat it, because it cannot only deduce the waste but also save the energy to produce new virgin plastic. Tribo-electrostatic separation is strongly recommended for plastic separation as it can preserve the original properties of plastic and has little additional pollution. In this study, plastic granules are generated by crushing plastic waste in waste electric and electronic equipment. The tribo-charging properties of plastic waste were studied by vibrating tribo-charging and cyclone tribo-charging. The triboelectric series obtained by vibrating was: (−)-PE–PS–PC–PVC–ABS–PP-(+), while the triboelectric series obtained by cyclone was (−)-PE–PS–PC–PVC–ABS–PP-(+). Further, the cyclone charging was more effective and stable than vibrating charging. The impact factors experiments showed that small particle size was better changed than large ones and were more suitable recycled by tribo-electrostatic separation. High relative humidity was identified as impede charging effect. The results of this study will help defining the operating parameters of subsequent separator.","","Available from http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.wasman.2014.10.001","","","","United States","2015-01-15T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: Waste Management; Journal Volume: 35; Other Information: Copyright (c) 2014 Elsevier Science B.V., Amsterdam, The Netherlands, All rights reserved.; Country of input: International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA)","","Medium: X; Size: page(s) 36-41","","","","Journal ID: ISSN 0956-053X; CODEN: WAMAE2; PII: S0956-053X(14)00453-X; TRN: US15R3217013139","10.1016/J.WASMAN.2014.10.001","","2016-03-10T00:00:00Z","22443598","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/22443598","","Waste Management","","35"

Modeling is an important tool to assess and to predict process performance. The present study focuses on the application of the Anaerobic Digestion Model No. 1 (ADM1) to simulate the dynamic behavior of a reactor fed with sewage sludge under mesophilic conditions. Parametric sensitivity analysis is used to select the most sensitive ADM1 parameters for estimation using a numerical procedure while other parameters are applied without any modification to the original values presented in the ADM1 report. The results indicate that the ADM1 model after parameter estimation was able to predict the experimental results of effluent acetate, propionate, composites and biogas flows and pH with reasonable accuracy. The simulation of the effect of organic shock loading clearly showed that an organic shock loading rate above of 35 kg/m{sup 3} day affects the performance of the reactor.

Doing so the dry AD was performed irrigating the solid waste with liquid digestate (flow rate of 1:1.18–1:0.9 w/w waste/digestate; 21 d of hydraulic retention time – HRT) in order to remove fermentation products inhibiting AD process. Results indicated that a high hydrolysis rate of organic matter (OM) and partial biogas production were obtained directly during the dry AD. Hydrolysate OM was removed from digester by the percolate flow and it was subsequently used to feed a liquid anaerobic digester. During dry AD a total loss of 36.9% of total solids was recorded. Methane balance indicated that 18.4% of potential methane can be produced during dry AD and 49.7% by the percolate. Nevertheless results obtained for liquid AD digestion indicated that only 20.4% and 25.7% of potential producible methane was generated by adopting 15 and 20 days of HRT, probably due to the AD inhibition due to high presence of toxic ammonia forms in the liquid medium.","","Available from http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.wasman.2014.09.009","","","","United States","2015-01-15T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: Waste Management; Journal Volume: 35; Other Information: Copyright (c) 2014 Elsevier Science B.V., Amsterdam, The Netherlands, All rights reserved.; Country of input: International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA)","","Medium: X; Size: page(s) 111-118","","","","Journal ID: ISSN 0956-053X; CODEN: WAMAE2; PII: S0956-053X(14)00431-0; TRN: US15R3223013144","10.1016/J.WASMAN.2014.09.009","","2016-03-10T00:00:00Z","22443603","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/22443603","","Waste Management","","35"

The management of odour from decomposing wastes is needed to sustain the interest of residents and local councils in the source separation of kitchen wastes. This study investigated the potential of baking soda (at 50 g, 75 g and 100 g per kg food waste) to control odour from seven days stored food waste. It was found that 50 g of baking soda, spread at the bottom of 8 l food wastes bin, can reduce the odour by about 70%. A higher amount (above 100 g) is not advised as a pH higher than 9.0 may be induced leading to the volatilization of odorous ammonia. This research finding is expected to benefit the waste management sector, food processing industries as well as the local authorities where malodour from waste storage is a pressing issue.","","Available from http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.wasman.2014.09.017","","","","United States","2015-01-15T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: Waste Management; Journal Volume: 35; Other Information: Copyright (c) 2014 Elsevier Science B.V., Amsterdam, The Netherlands, All rights reserved.; Country of input: International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA)","","Medium: X; Size: page(s) 187-190","","","","Journal ID: ISSN 0956-053X; CODEN: WAMAE2; PII: S0956-053X(14)00439-5; TRN: US15R3229013150","10.1016/J.WASMAN.2014.09.017","","2016-03-10T00:00:00Z","22443609","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/22443609","","Waste Management","","35"
"Household-level dynamics of food waste production and related beliefs, attitudes, and behaviours in Guelph, Ontario","Parizeau, Kate; Massow, Mike von; Martin, Ralph","54 ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCES; 12 MANAGEMENT OF RADIOACTIVE WASTES, AND NON-RADIOACTIVE WASTES FROM NUCLEAR FACILITIES; ADMINISTRATIVE PROCEDURES; ATTITUDES; ENVIRONMENTAL POLICY; FOOD; HOUSEHOLDS; ONTARIO; ORGANIC WASTES; WASTE MANAGEMENT","Highlights: • We combined household waste stream weights with survey data. • We examine relationships between waste and food-related practices and beliefs. • Families and large households produced more total waste, but less waste per capita. • Food awareness and waste awareness were related to reduced food waste. • Convenience lifestyles were differentially associated with food waste. - Abstract: It has been estimated that Canadians waste $27 billion of food annually, and that half of that waste occurs at the household level (Gooch et al., 2010). There are social, environmental, and economic implications for this scale of food waste, and source separation of organic waste is an increasingly common municipal intervention. There is relatively little research that assesses the dynamics of household food waste (particularly in Canada). The purpose of this study is to combine observations of organic, recyclable, and garbage waste production rates to survey results of food waste-related beliefs, attitudes, and behaviours at the household level in the mid-sized municipality of Guelph, Ontario. Waste weights and surveys were obtained from 68 households in the summer of 2013. The results of this study indicate multiple relationships between food waste production and household shopping practices, food preparation behaviours, household waste management practices, and food-related attitudes, beliefs, and lifestyles. Notably, we observed that food awareness, waste awareness, family lifestyles, and convenience lifestyles were related to food waste production. We conclude that it is important to understand the diversity of factors that can influence food wasting behaviours at the household level in order to design waste management systems and policies to reduce food waste.","","Available from http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.wasman.2014.09.019","","","","United States","2015-01-15T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: Waste Management; Journal Volume: 35; Other Information: Copyright (c) 2014 Elsevier Science B.V., Amsterdam, The Netherlands, All rights reserved.; Country of input: International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA)","","Medium: X; Size: page(s) 207-217","","","","Journal ID: ISSN 0956-053X; CODEN: WAMAE2; PII: S0956-053X(14)00441-3; TRN: US15R3231013152","10.1016/J.WASMAN.2014.09.019","","2016-03-10T00:00:00Z","22443611","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/22443611","","Waste Management","","35"

One of the important reasons is the lack of comprehensive characterisation on such materials, i.e. accurate compositions, physical/chemical properties. In the present research, we focus on developing methodologies for the characterisation of metals in an industrially processed ICT waste. The morphology, particle size distribution, compositional distribution, occurrence, liberation as well as the thermo-chemical properties of the ICT waste were investigated with various characterisation techniques, including X-ray Fluorescence Spectrometry (XRF), differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) and scanning electron microscopy (SEM) with energy dispersed spectroscopy (EDS). Due to the high heterogeneity of the material, special sample preparation procedures were introduced to minimise the discrepancies during compositional analyses. As a result, a clearer overview of the ICT waste has been reached. This research provides better understanding of the extractability of each metal and improves the awareness of potential obstacles for extraction. It will lead to smarter decisions during further development of a clean and effective recovery process.","","Available from http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.wasman.2014.09.021","","","","United States","2015-01-15T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: Waste Management; Journal Volume: 35; Other Information: Copyright (c) 2014 Elsevier Science B.V., Amsterdam, The Netherlands, All rights reserved.; Country of input: International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA)","","Medium: X; Size: page(s) 227-235","","","","Journal ID: ISSN 0956-053X; CODEN: WAMAE2; PII: S0956-053X(14)00443-7; TRN: US15R3232013153","10.1016/J.WASMAN.2014.09.021","","2016-03-10T00:00:00Z","22443612","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/22443612","","Waste Management","","35"

In the past decades, due to the lack of proper economic and environmentally-benign recycling technologies, a major fraction of e-waste generated was either destined to landfills or incinerated with the sole intention of its disposal disregarding the toxic nature of this waste. Recently, with the increasing public awareness over their environment and health issues and with the enaction of more stringent regulations, environmentally-benign recycling has been driven to be an alternative option partially replacing the traditional eco-unfriendly disposal methods. One of the most favorable green technologies has been the mechanical separation of the metallic and nonmetallic fraction of the waste printed circuit boards. Although metallic fraction, as the most profitable component, is used to generate the revenue of the separation process, the nonmetallic fraction (NMF) has been left isolated. Herein, the recent developments in the application of NMF have been comprehensively reviewed and an eco-friendly emerging usage of NMF as a value-added material for sustainable remediation has been introduced.","","Available from http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.wasman.2014.09.020","","","","United States","2015-01-15T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: Waste Management; Journal Volume: 35; Other Information: Copyright (c) 2014 Elsevier Science B.V., Amsterdam, The Netherlands, All rights reserved.; Country of input: International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA)","","Medium: X; Size: page(s) 236-246","","","","Journal ID: ISSN 0956-053X; CODEN: WAMAE2; PII: S0956-053X(14)00442-5; TRN: US15R3233013154","10.1016/J.WASMAN.2014.09.020","","2016-03-10T00:00:00Z","22443613","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/22443613","","Waste Management","","35"

Decision-makers look for decision support frameworks that can guide in defining alternatives, relevant criteria and their weights, and finding a suitable solution. In addition, decision-making in MSWM problems such as finding proper waste treatment locations or strategies often requires multiple stakeholders such as government, municipalities, industries, experts, and/or general public to get involved. Multi-criteria Decision Analysis (MCDA) is the most popular framework employed in previous studies on MSWM; MCDA methods help multiple stakeholders evaluate the often conflicting criteria, communicate their different preferences, and rank or prioritize MSWM strategies to finally agree on some elements of these strategies and make an applicable decision. This paper reviews and brings together research on the application of MCDA for solving MSWM problems with more focus on the studies that have considered multiple stakeholders and offers solutions for such problems. Results of this study show that AHP is the most common approach in consideration of multiple stakeholders and experts and governments/municipalities are the most common participants in these studies.","","Available from http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.wasman.2014.09.010","","","","United States","2015-01-15T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: Waste Management; Journal Volume: 35; Other Information: Copyright (c) 2014 Elsevier Science B.V., Amsterdam, The Netherlands, All rights reserved.; Country of input: International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA)","","Medium: X; Size: page(s) 318-328","","","","Journal ID: ISSN 0956-053X; CODEN: WAMAE2; PII: S0956-053X(14)00432-2; TRN: US15R3239013159","10.1016/J.WASMAN.2014.09.010","","2016-03-10T00:00:00Z","22443618","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/22443618","","Waste Management","","35"

To do so, the SF of digestates obtained from anaerobic digestion of pig slurry, energy crops and agro-industrial residues were sampled in five plants located in Northern Italy. Results obtained indicated that anaerobic digestion by itself promoted the high biological stability of biomasses with a Potential Dynamic Respiration Index (PDRI) close to 1000 mgO{sub 2} kg V S{sup −1} h{sup −1}. Subsequent composting of digestates, with an added bulking agent, did not give remarkably different results, and led only to a slight modification of the characteristics of the initial non-composted mixtures; the composts obtained fully respected the legal limits for high quality compost. Chemical studies of organic matter composition of the biomasses by using CP MAS {sup 13}C NMR, indicated that the compost was composed of a high relative content of O-alkyl-C (71.47% of total C) (cellulose and hemicelluloses) and a low alkyl-C (12.42%) (i.e. volatile fatty acids, steroid-like molecules, aliphatic biopolymers and proteins)","","Available from http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.wasman.2014.10.014","","","","United States","2015-01-15T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: Waste Management; Journal Volume: 35; Other Information: Copyright (c) 2014 Elsevier Science B.V., Amsterdam, The Netherlands, All rights reserved.; Country of input: International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA)","","Medium: X; Size: page(s) 55-61","","","","Journal ID: ISSN 0956-053X; CODEN: WAMAE2; PII: S0956-053X(14)00498-X; TRN: US15R3219017115","10.1016/J.WASMAN.2014.10.014","","2016-03-14T00:00:00Z","22447573","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/22447573","","Waste Management","","35"

One promising technology for recycling municipal solid waste (MSW) is to burn the high-energy-content components in standard coal power plant. This research aims to reform wastes into briquettes that are compatible with typical coal combustion processes. In order to comply with the standards of coal-fired power plants, the feedstock must be mechanically robust, free of hazardous contaminants, and moisture resistant, while retaining high fuel value. This study aims to investigate the effects of processing conditions and added recyclable plastics on the properties of MSW solid fuels. A well-sorted waste stream high in paper and fiber content was combined with controlled levels of recyclable plastics PE, PP, PET and PS and formed into briquettes using a compression molding technique. The effect of added plastics and moisture content on binding attraction and energy efficiency were investigated. The stability of the briquettes to moisture exposure, the fuel composition by proximate analysis, briquette mechanical strength, and burning efficiency were evaluated. It was found that high processing temperature ensures better properties of the product addition of milled mixed plastic waste leads to better encapsulation as well as to greater calorific value. Also some moisture removal (but not complete) improves the compacting process and results in higher heating value. Analysis of the post-processing water uptake and compressive strength showed a correlation between density and stability to both mechanical stress and humid environment. Proximate analysis indicated heating values comparable to coal. The results showed that mechanical and moisture uptake stability were improved when the moisture and air contents were optimized. Moreover, the briquette sample composition was similar to biomass fuels but had significant advantages due to addition of waste plastics that have high energy content compared to other waste types. Addition of PP and HDPE presented better benefits than addition of PET due to lower softening temperature and lower oxygen content. It should be noted that while harmful emissions such as dioxins, furans and mercury can result from burning plastics, WTE facilities have been able to control these emissions to meet US EPA standards. This research provides a drop-in coal replacement that reduces demand on landfill space and replaces a significant fraction of fossil-derived fuel with a renewable alternative.","","Available from http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.wasman.2014.09.031","","","","United States","2015-01-15T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: Waste Management; Journal Volume: 35; Other Information: Copyright (c) 2014 Elsevier Science B.V., Amsterdam, The Netherlands, All rights reserved.; Country of input: International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA)","","Medium: X; Size: page(s) 283-292","","","","Journal ID: ISSN 0956-053X; CODEN: WAMAE2; PII: S0956-053X(14)00456-5; TRN: US15R3236017116","10.1016/J.WASMAN.2014.09.031","","2016-03-14T00:00:00Z","22447574","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/22447574","","Waste Management","","35"

Results of the experimentations were promising, and have been extensively described in Biganzoli et al. (2014). This paper reports the Life Cycle Assessment (LCA) study performed to compare the traditional operation of the plants, based on the sole sodium bicarbonate feeding at low temperature, with the new one, where the dolomitic sorbent is injected at high temperature. In the latter the sodium bicarbonate is still used, but at lower rate because of the decreased load of acid gases entering the flue gas treatment line. The major goal of the LCA was to make sure that a burden shifting was not taking place somewhere in the life cycle stages, as it might be the case when a new material is used in substitution of another one. According to the comparative approach, only the processes which differ between the two operational modes were included in the system boundaries. They are the production of the two reactants and the treatment of the corresponding solid residues arising from the neutralisation of acid gases. The additional CO{sub 2} emission at the stack of the WTE plant due to the activation of the sodium bicarbonate was also included in the calculation. Data used in the modelling of the foreground system are primary, derived from the experimental tests described in Biganzoli et al. (2014) and from the dolomitic sorbent production plant. The results of the LCA show minor changes in the potential impacts between the two operational modes of the plants. These differences are for 8 impact categories in favour of the new operational mode based on the addition of the dolomitic sorbent, and for 7 impact categories in favour of the traditional operation. A final evaluation was conducted on the potential role of the dolomitic sorbent in enhancing the electric energy production efficiency of the plant, thanks to the better cleaning of the heat exchange surface that can be achieved. If such improvement is accounted for, all the potential impacts are considerably decreased (e.g. the Climate change by 28%), and in the comparison with the traditional operation 17 impact categories out of 19 are reduced.","","Available from http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.wasman.2014.10.021","","","","United States","2015-01-15T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: Waste Management; Journal Volume: 35; Other Information: Copyright (c) 2014 Elsevier Science B.V., Amsterdam, The Netherlands, All rights reserved.; Country of input: International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA)","","Medium: X; Size: page(s) 127-134","","","","Journal ID: ISSN 0956-053X; CODEN: WAMAE2; PII: S0956-053X(14)00505-4; TRN: US15R3224013145","10.1016/J.WASMAN.2014.10.021","","2016-03-10T00:00:00Z","22443604","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/22443604","","Waste Management","","35"

At five Swiss waste incineration facilities with grate firing, emission factors for N{sub 2}O and CH{sub 4} were determined based on measurements of representative flue gas samples, which were collected in Tedlar bags over a one year period (September 2010–August 2011) and analysed with FTIR spectroscopy. All five plants burn a mixture of household and industrial waste, and two of the plants employ NO{sub x} removal through selective non-catalytic reduction (SNCR) while three plants use selective catalytic reduction (SCR) for NO{sub x} removal. N{sub 2}O emissions from incineration plants with NO{sub x} removal through selective catalytic reduction were 4.3 ± 4.0 g N{sub 2}O tonne{sup −1} waste (wet) (hereafter abbreviated as t{sup −1}) (0.4 ± 0.4 g N{sub 2}O GJ{sup −1}), ten times lower than from plants with selective non-catalytic reduction (51.5 ± 10.6 g N{sub 2}O t{sup −1}; 4.5 ± 0.9 g N{sub 2}O GJ{sup −1}). These emission factors, which are much lower than the value of 120 g N{sub 2}O t{sup −1} (10.4 g N{sub 2}O GJ{sup −1}) used in the 2013 Swiss national greenhouse gas emission inventory, have been implemented in the most recent Swiss emission inventory. In addition, the isotopic composition of N{sub 2}O emitted from the two plants with SNCR, which had considerable N{sub 2}O emissions, was measured using quantum cascade laser spectroscopy. The isotopic site preference of N{sub 2}O – the enrichment of {sup 14}N{sup 15}NO relative to {sup 15}N{sup 14}NO – was found to be 17.6 ± 0.8‰, with no significant difference between the two plants. Comparison to previous studies suggests SP of 17–19‰ may be characteristic for N{sub 2}O produced from SNCR. Methane emissions were found to be insignificant, with a maximum emission factor of 2.5 ± 5.6 g CH{sub 4} t{sup −1} (0.2 ± 0.5 g CH{sub 4} GJ{sup −1}), which is expected due to high incinerator temperatures and efficient combustion.","","Available from http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.wasman.2014.10.016","","","","United States","2015-01-15T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: Waste Management; Journal Volume: 35; Other Information: Copyright (c) 2014 Elsevier Science B.V., Amsterdam, The Netherlands, All rights reserved.; Country of input: International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA)","","Medium: X; Size: page(s) 135-140","","","","Journal ID: ISSN 0956-053X; CODEN: WAMAE2; PII: S0956-053X(14)00500-5; TRN: US15R3225013146","10.1016/J.WASMAN.2014.10.016","","2016-03-10T00:00:00Z","22443605","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/22443605","","Waste Management","","35"

This work applied a cost-benefit analysis model for assessing the economic feasibility, which is important for promoting landfill mining. The model includes eight indicators of costs and nine indicators of benefits. Four landfill mining scenarios were designed and analyzed based on field data. The economic feasibility of landfill mining was then evaluated by the indicator of net present value (NPV). According to our case study of a typical old landfill mining project in China (Yingchun landfill), rental of excavation and hauling equipment, waste processing and material transportation were the top three costs of landfill mining, accounting for 88.2% of the total cost, and the average cost per unit of stored waste was 12.7 USD ton{sup −1}. The top three benefits of landfill mining were electricity generation by incineration, land reclamation and recycling soil-like materials. The NPV analysis of the four different scenarios indicated that the Yingchun landfill mining project could obtain a net positive benefit varying from 1.92 million USD to 16.63 million USD. However, the NPV was sensitive to the mode of land reuse, the availability of energy recovery facilities and the possibility of obtaining financial support by avoiding post-closure care.","","Available from http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.wasman.2014.09.029","","","","United States","2015-01-15T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: Waste Management; Journal Volume: 35; Other Information: Copyright (c) 2014 Elsevier Science B.V., Amsterdam, The Netherlands, All rights reserved.; Country of input: International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA)","","Medium: X; Size: page(s) 191-198","","","","Journal ID: ISSN 0956-053X; CODEN: WAMAE2; PII: S0956-053X(14)00451-6; TRN: US15R3230013151","10.1016/J.WASMAN.2014.09.029","","2016-03-10T00:00:00Z","22443610","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/22443610","","Waste Management","","35"
"Estimation of retired mobile phones generation in China: A comparative study on methodology","Li, Bo; Yang, Jianxin; Lu, Bin; Song, Xiaolong","12 MANAGEMENT OF RADIOACTIVE WASTES, AND NON-RADIOACTIVE WASTES FROM NUCLEAR FACILITIES; CHINA; ELECTRICAL EQUIPMENT; ELECTRONIC EQUIPMENT; ENVIRONMENTAL POLICY; MATERIALS RECOVERY; MOBILE PHONES; WASTES","Highlights: • The sales data of mobile phones in China was revised by considering the amount of smuggled and counterfeit mobile phones. • The estimation of retired mobile phones in China was made by comparing some relevant methods. • The advanced result of estimation can help improve the policy-making. • The method suggested in this paper can be also used in other countries. • Some discussions on methodology are also conducted in order for the improvement. - Abstract: Due to the rapid development of economy and technology, China has the biggest production and possession of mobile phones around the world. In general, mobile phones have relatively short life time because the majority of users replace their mobile phones frequently. Retired mobile phones represent the most valuable electrical and electronic equipment (EEE) in the main waste stream because of such characteristics as large quantity, high reuse/recovery value and fast replacement frequency. Consequently, the huge amount of retired mobile phones in China calls for a sustainable management system. The generation estimation can provide fundamental information to construct the sustainable management system of retired mobile phones and other waste electrical and electronic equipment (WEEE). However, the reliable estimation result is difficult to get and verify. The priority aim of this paper is to provide proper estimation approach for the generation of retired mobile phones in China, by comparing some relevant methods. The results show that the sales and new method is in the highest priority in estimation of the retired mobile phones. The result of sales and new method shows that there are 47.92 million mobile phones retired in 2002, and it reached to 739.98 million in China in 2012. It presents an increasing tendency with some fluctuations clearly. Furthermore, some discussions on methodology, such as the selection of improper approach and error in the input data, are also conducted in order to improve generation estimation of retired mobile phones and other WEEE.","","Available from http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.wasman.2014.09.008","","","","United States","2015-01-15T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: Waste Management; Journal Volume: 35; Other Information: Copyright (c) 2014 Elsevier Science B.V., Amsterdam, The Netherlands, All rights reserved.; Country of input: International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA)","","Medium: X; Size: page(s) 247-254","","","","Journal ID: ISSN 0956-053X; CODEN: WAMAE2; PII: S0956-053X(14)00430-9; TRN: US15R3234013155","10.1016/J.WASMAN.2014.09.008","","2016-03-10T00:00:00Z","22443614","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/22443614","","Waste Management","","35"
"Understanding the perceptions, roles and interactions of stakeholder networks managing health-care waste: A case study of the Gaza Strip","Caniato, M., E-mail: marcocaniato@gmail.com; Tudor, T.; Vaccari, M.","12 MANAGEMENT OF RADIOACTIVE WASTES, AND NON-RADIOACTIVE WASTES FROM NUCLEAR FACILITIES; ENVIRONMENTAL POLICY; ENVIRONMENTAL QUALITY; NETWORK ANALYSIS; REGULATIONS; REVIEWS; SEGREGATION; SOLID WASTES; WASTE MANAGEMENT","Highlights: • We systematically review scientific literature about health-care waste management. • We identify and discuss gaps, trends, efforts, and key-factors. • We suggest areas for improvement and best practices reported in literature. • We include recommendations for policy makers, practitioners and researchers. • We promote a holistic and harmonized approach to health-care waste management. - Abstract: The sustainable management of waste requires a holistic approach involving a range of stakeholders. What can often be difficult is to understand the manner in which different types of stakeholder networks are composed and work, and how best to enhance their effectiveness. Using social network analysis and stakeholder analysis of healthcare waste management stakeholders in the case study region of the Gaza Strip, this study aimed to understand and examine the manner in which the networks functioned. The Ministry of Health was found to be the most important stakeholder, followed by municipalities and solid waste management councils. Some international agencies were also mentioned, with specific roles, while other local institutions had a limited influence. Finally while health-care facilities had a strong interest in waste management, they were generally poorly informed and had limited links to each other. The manner in which the networks operated was complicated and influenced by differences in perception, sharing of information, access to finance and levels of awareness. The lack of a clear legal framework generated various mistakes about roles and responsibilities in the system, and evidently regulation was not an effective driver for improvement. Finally stakeholders had different priorities according to the waste management issues they were involved with, however segregation at the source was identified as a key requirement by most. Areas for improving the effectiveness of the networks are suggested. The analysis utilized an innovative methodology, which involved a large number of stakeholders. Such an approach served to raise interest and awareness at different levels (public authorities, health providers, supporting actors, others), stimulate the discussion about the adoption of specific policies, and identify the effective way forward.","","Available from http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.wasman.2014.09.018","","","","United States","2015-01-15T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: Waste Management; Journal Volume: 35; Other Information: Copyright (c) 2014 Elsevier Science B.V., Amsterdam, The Netherlands, All rights reserved.; Country of input: International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA)","","Medium: X; Size: page(s) 255-264","","","","Journal ID: ISSN 0956-053X; CODEN: WAMAE2; PII: S0956-053X(14)00440-1; TRN: US15R3235013156","10.1016/J.WASMAN.2014.09.018","","2016-03-10T00:00:00Z","22443615","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/22443615","","Waste Management","","35"

Based on new primary data, a process model was developed to estimate the cost and energy use associated with material recovery facilities (MRFs), which are responsible for sorting recyclables into saleable streams and as such represent a key piece of recycling infrastructure. The model includes four modules, each with a different process flow, for separation of single-stream, dual-stream, pre-sorted recyclables, and mixed-waste. Each MRF type has a distinct combination of equipment and default input waste composition. Model results for total amortized costs from each MRF type ranged from $19.8 to $24.9 per Mg (1 Mg = 1 metric ton) of waste input. Electricity use ranged from 4.7 to 7.8 kW h per Mg of waste input. In a single-stream MRF, equipment required for glass separation consumes 28% of total facility electricity consumption, while all other pieces of material recovery equipment consume less than 10% of total electricity. The dual-stream and mixed-waste MRFs have similar electricity consumption to a single-stream MRF. Glass separation contributes a much larger fraction of electricity consumption in a pre-sorted MRF, due to lower overall facility electricity consumption. Parametric analysis revealed that reducing separation efficiency for each piece of equipment by 25% altered total facility electricity consumption by less than 4% in each case. When model results were compared with actual data for an existing single-stream MRF, the model estimated the facility’s electricity consumption within 2%. The results from this study can be integrated into LCAs of solid waste management with system boundaries that extend from the curb through final disposal.","","Available from http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.wasman.2014.09.012","","","","United States","2015-01-15T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: Waste Management; Journal Volume: 35; Other Information: Copyright (c) 2014 Elsevier Science B.V., Amsterdam, The Netherlands, All rights reserved.; Country of input: International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA)","","Medium: X; Size: page(s) 307-317","","","","Journal ID: ISSN 0956-053X; CODEN: WAMAE2; PII: S0956-053X(14)00434-6; TRN: US15R3238013158","10.1016/J.WASMAN.2014.09.012","","2016-03-10T00:00:00Z","22443617","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/22443617","","Waste Management","","35"

The paper presents an indicator set for integrated sustainable waste management (ISWM) in cities both North and South, to allow benchmarking of a city’s performance, comparing cities and monitoring developments over time. It builds on pioneering work for UN-Habitat’s solid waste management in the World’s cities. The comprehensive analytical framework of a city’s solid waste management system is divided into two overlapping ‘triangles’ – one comprising the three physical components, i.e. collection, recycling, and disposal, and the other comprising three governance aspects, i.e. inclusivity; financial sustainability; and sound institutions and proactive policies. The indicator set includes essential quantitative indicators as well as qualitative composite indicators. This updated and revised ‘Wasteaware’ set of ISWM benchmark indicators is the cumulative result of testing various prototypes in more than 50 cities around the world. This experience confirms the utility of indicators in allowing comprehensive performance measurement and comparison of both ‘hard’ physical components and ‘soft’ governance aspects; and in prioritising ‘next steps’ in developing a city’s solid waste management system, by identifying both local strengths that can be built on and weak points to be addressed. The Wasteaware ISWM indicators are applicable to a broad range of cities with very different levels of income and solid waste management practices. Their wide application as a standard methodology will help to fill the historical data gap.","","Available from http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.wasman.2014.10.006","","","","United States","2015-01-15T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: Waste Management; Journal Volume: 35; Other Information: Copyright (c) 2014 Elsevier Science B.V., Amsterdam, The Netherlands, All rights reserved.; Country of input: International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA)","","Medium: X; Size: page(s) 329-342","","","","Journal ID: ISSN 0956-053X; CODEN: WAMAE2; PII: S0956-053X(14)00490-5; TRN: US15R3240013160","10.1016/J.WASMAN.2014.10.006","","2016-03-10T00:00:00Z","22443619","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/22443619","","Waste Management","","35"

"Towards increased waste loading in high level waste glasses: Developing a better understanding of crystallization behavior","Marra, James C.; Kim, Dong -Sang","12 MANAGEMENT OF RADIOACTIVE AND NON-RADIOACTIVE WASTES FROM NUCLEAR FACILITIES; vitrification; glass melter; nepheline; spinel; waste loading; radioactive waste; cold crucible induction melter; waste glass; crystallization","A number of waste components in US defense high level radioactive wastes (HLW) have proven challenging for current Joule heated ceramic melter (JCHM) operations and have limited the ability to increase waste loadings beyond already realized levels. Many of these ''troublesome'' waste species cause crystallization in the glass melt that can negatively impact product quality or have a deleterious effect on melter processing. Thus, recent efforts at US Department of Energy laboratories have focused on understanding crystallization behavior within HLW glass melts and investigating approaches to mitigate the impacts of crystallization so that increases in waste loading can be realized. Advanced glass formulations have been developed to highlight the unique benefits of next-generation melter technologies such as the Cold Crucible Induction Melter (CCIM). Crystal-tolerant HLW glasses have been investigated to allow sparingly soluble components such as chromium to crystallize in the melter but pass out of the melter before accumulating. The Hanford site AZ-101 tank waste composition represents a waste group that is waste loading limited primarily due to high concentrations of Fe<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub> (with higher Al<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub>). Systematic glass formulation development utilizing slightly higher process temperatures and higher tolerance to spinel crystals demonstrated that an increase in waste loading of more than 20% could be achieved for this waste composition, and by extension higher loadings for wastes in the same group.","Elsevier","","Savannah River Site (SRS), Aiken, SC (United States); Pacific Northwest National Lab.

"Conversion of Nuclear Waste into Nuclear Waste Glass: Experimental Investigation and Mathematical Modeling","Hrma, Pavel","12 MANAGEMENT OF RADIOACTIVE AND NON-RADIOACTIVE WASTES FROM NUCLEAR FACILITIES","The melter feed, slurry, or calcine charged on the top of a pool of molten glass forms a floating layer of reacting material called the cold cap. Between the cold-cap top, which is covered with boiling slurry, and its bottom, where bubbles separate it from molten glass, the temperature changes by up to 1000 K. The processes that occur over this temperature interval within the cold cap include liberation of gases, conduction and consumption of heat, dissolution of quartz particles, formation and dissolution of intermediate crystalline phases, and generation of foam and gas cavities. These processes have been investigated using thermal analyses, optical and electronic microscopies, x-ray diffraction, as well as other techniques. Properties of the reacting feed, such as heat conductivity and density, were measured as functions of temperature. Investigating the structure of quenched cold caps produced in a laboratory-scale melter complemented the crucible studies. The cold cap consists of two main layers. The top layer contains solid particles dissolving in the glass-forming melt and open pores through which gases are escaping. The bottom layer contains bubbly melt or foam where bubbles coalesce into larger cavities that move sideways and release the gas to the atmosphere. The feed-to-glass conversion became sufficiently understood for representing the cold-cap processes via mathematical models. These models, which comprise heat transfer, mass transfer, and reaction kinetics models, have been developed with the final goal to relate feed parameters to the rate of glass melting.","Elsevier","","Pacific Northwest National Lab.

European countries are therefore incorporating it into their current municipal solid waste management (MSWM) systems. However, this incorporation involves changes in the current waste management habits of households. In this paper, the attitude of the public towards the incorporation of selective collection of biowaste into an existing MSWM system in a Spanish municipality is analysed. A semi-structured telephone interview was used to obtain information regarding aspects such as: level of participation in current waste collection systems, willingness to participate in selective collection of biowaste, reasons and barriers that affect participation, willingness to pay for the incorporation of the selective collection of biowaste and the socioeconomic characteristics of citizens who are willing to participate and pay for selective collection of biowaste. The results showed that approximately 81% of the respondents were willing to participate in selective collection of biowaste. This percentage would increase until 89% if the Town Council provided specific waste bins and bags, since the main barrier to participate in the new selective collection system is the need to use specific waste bin and bags for the separation of biowaste. A logit response model was applied to estimate the average willingness to pay, obtaining an estimated mean of 7.5% on top of the current waste management annual tax. The relationship of willingness to participate and willingness to pay for the implementation of this new selective collection with the socioeconomic variables (age, gender, size of the household, work, education and income) was analysed. Chi-square independence tests and binary logistic regression was used for willingness to participate, not being obtained any significant relationship. Chi-square independence tests, ordinal logistic regression and ordinary linear regression was applied for willingness to pay, obtaining statistically significant relationship for most of the socioeconomic variables.","","Available from http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.wasman.2014.08.023","","","","United States","2014-12-15T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: Waste Management; Journal Volume: 34; Journal Issue: 12; Other Information: Copyright (c) 2014 Elsevier Science B.V., Amsterdam, The Netherlands, All rights reserved.; Country of input: International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA)","","Medium: X; Size: page(s) 2434-2444","","","","Journal ID: ISSN 0956-053X; CODEN: WAMAE2; PII: S0956-053X(14)00378-X; TRN: US15R3174013097","10.1016/J.WASMAN.2014.08.023","","2016-03-10T00:00:00Z","22443556","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/22443556","","Waste Management","12","34"

This review addresses the state-of-the-art of MSW pyrolysis in regards to its technologies and reactors, products and environmental impacts. In this review, first, the influence of important operating parameters such as final temperature, heating rate (HR) and residence time in the reaction zone on the pyrolysis behaviours and products is reviewed; then the pyrolysis technologies and reactors adopted in literatures and scale-up plants are evaluated. Third, the yields and main properties of the pyrolytic products from individual MSW components, refuse-derived fuel (RDF) made from MSW, and MSW are summarised. In the fourth section, in addition to emissions from pyrolysis processes, such as HCl, SO{sub 2} and NH{sub 3}, contaminants in the products, including PCDD/F and heavy metals, are also reviewed, and available measures for improving the environmental impacts of pyrolysis are surveyed. It can be concluded that the single pyrolysis process is an effective waste-to-energy convertor but is not a guaranteed clean solution for MSW disposal. Based on this information, the prospects of applying pyrolysis technologies to dealing with MSW are evaluated and suggested.","","Available from http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.wasman.2014.08.004","","","","United States","2014-12-15T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: Waste Management; Journal Volume: 34; Journal Issue: 12; Other Information: Copyright (c) 2014 Elsevier Science B.V., Amsterdam, The Netherlands, All rights reserved.; Country of input: International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA)","","Medium: X; Size: page(s) 2466-2486","","","","Journal ID: ISSN 0956-053X; CODEN: WAMAE2; PII: S0956-053X(14)00359-6; TRN: US15R3176013099","10.1016/J.WASMAN.2014.08.004","","2016-03-10T00:00:00Z","22443558","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/22443558","","Waste Management","12","34"

In addition to compressive strength measurements, hydrated pastes were characterized by X-ray diffraction (XRD), thermal-analyses (DTA/TG), and MAS NMR ({sup 27}Al and {sup 29}Si) techniques. It was found that silica fume additions could effectively reduce the leaching of toxic heavy metals. At the addition of 20% silica fume, leaching concentrations for Cu, Pb and Zn of the hydrated paste cured for 7 days decreased from 0.32 mg/L to 0.05 mg/L, 40.99 mg/L to 4.40 mg/L, and 6.96 mg/L to 0.21 mg/L compared with the MSWI fly ash. After curing for 135 days, Cd and Pb in the leachates were not detected, while Cu and Zn concentrations decreased to 0.02 mg/L and 0.03 mg/L. The speciation of Pb and Cd by the modified version of the European Community Bureau of Reference (BCR) extractions showed that these metals converted into more stable state in hydrated pastes of MSWI fly ash in the presence of silica fume. Although exchangeable and weak-acid soluble fractions of Cu and Zn increased with hydration time, silica fume addition of 10% can satisfy the requirement of detoxification for heavy metals investigated in terms of the identification standard of hazardous waste of China.","","Available from http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.wasman.2014.08.027","","","","United States","2014-12-15T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: Waste Management; Journal Volume: 34; Journal Issue: 12; Other Information: Copyright (c) 2014 Elsevier Science B.V., Amsterdam, The Netherlands, All rights reserved.; Country of input: International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA)","","Medium: X; Size: page(s) 2494-2504","","","","Journal ID: ISSN 0956-053X; CODEN: WAMAE2; PII: S0956-053X(14)00382-1; TRN: US15R3178013101","10.1016/J.WASMAN.2014.08.027","","2016-03-10T00:00:00Z","22443560","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/22443560","","Waste Management","12","34"
"Trace element partitioning in ashes from boilers firing pure wood or mixtures of solid waste with respect to fuel composition, chlorine content and temperature","Saqib, Naeem; Bäckström, Mattias","37 INORGANIC, ORGANIC, PHYSICAL AND ANALYTICAL CHEMISTRY; 12 MANAGEMENT OF RADIOACTIVE WASTES, AND NON-RADIOACTIVE WASTES FROM NUCLEAR FACILITIES; ANTIMONY; BIOFUELS; CADMIUM; CHLORIDES; CHLORINE; CHROMIUM; COPPER; FLY ASH; INDUSTRIAL WASTES; LEAD; MERCURY; MUNICIPAL WASTES; OXIDES; PETROLEUM RESIDUES; TRACE AMOUNTS; VOLATILITY; WASTE MANAGEMENT; WOOD; WOOD WASTES; ZINC","Highlights: • Different solids waste incineration is discussed in grate fired and fluidized bed boilers. • We explained waste composition, temperature and chlorine effects on metal partitioning. • Excessive chlorine content can change oxide to chloride equilibrium partitioning the trace elements in fly ash. • Volatility increases with temperature due to increase in vapor pressure of metals and compounds. • In Fluidized bed boiler, most metals find themselves in fly ash, especially for wood incineration. - Abstract: Trace element partitioning in solid waste (household waste, industrial waste, waste wood chips and waste mixtures) incineration residues was investigated. Samples of fly ash and bottom ash were collected from six incineration facilities across Sweden including two grate fired and four fluidized bed incinerators, to have a variation in the input fuel composition (from pure biofuel to mixture of waste) and different temperature boiler conditions. As trace element concentrations in the input waste at the same facilities have already been analyzed, the present study focuses on the concentration of trace elements in the waste fuel, their distribution in the incineration residues with respect to chlorine content of waste and combustion temperature. Results indicate that Zn, Cu and Pb are dominating trace elements in the waste fuel. Highly volatile elements mercury and cadmium are mainly found in fly ash in all cases; 2/3 of lead also end up in fly ash while Zn, As and Sb show a large variation in distribution with most of them residing in the fly ash. Lithophilic elements such as copper and chromium are mainly found in bottom ash from grate fired facilities while partition mostly into fly ash from fluidized bed incinerators, especially for plants fuelled by waste wood or ordinary wood chips. There is no specific correlation between input concentration of an element in the waste fuel and fraction partitioned to fly ash. Temperature and chlorine content have significant effects on partitioning characteristics by increasing the formation and vaporization of highly volatile metal chlorides. Zinc and cadmium concentrations in fly ash increase with the incineration temperature.","","Available from http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.wasman.2014.08.025","","","","United States","2014-12-15T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: Waste Management; Journal Volume: 34; Journal Issue: 12; Other Information: Copyright (c) 2014 Elsevier Science B.V., Amsterdam, The Netherlands, All rights reserved.; Country of input: International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA)","","Medium: X; Size: page(s) 2505-2519","","","","Journal ID: ISSN 0956-053X; CODEN: WAMAE2; PII: S0956-053X(14)00380-8; TRN: US15R3179013102","10.1016/J.WASMAN.2014.08.025","","2016-03-10T00:00:00Z","22443561","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/22443561","","Waste Management","12","34"

Consequently, a common practice in managing tannery sewage sludge is landfilling. This poses a potential threat to both soil and water environments and it additionally generates costs of construction of landfills that meet specific environment protection requirements. Vitrification of this kind of sewage sludge with the addition of mineral wastes can represent an alternative to landfilling. The aim of this study was to investigate the possibility of obtaining an environmentally safe product by means of vitrification of tannery sewage sludge from a flotation wastewater treatment process and chemical precipitation in order to address the upcoming issue of dealing with sewage sludge from the tannery industry which will be prohibited to be landfilled in Poland after 2016. The focus was set on determining mixtures of tannery sewage sludge with additives which would result in the lowest possible heavy metal leaching levels and highest hardness rating of the products obtained from their vitrification. The plasma vitrification process was carried out for mixtures with various amounts of additives depending on the type of sewage sludge used. Only the materials of waste character were used as additives. One finding of the study was an optimum content of mineral additives in vitrified mixture of 30% v/v waste molding sands with 20% v/v carbonate flotation waste from the zinc and lead industry for the formulations with flotation sewage sludge, and 45% v/v and 5% v/v, respectively, for precipitation sewage sludge. These combinations allowed for obtaining products with negligible heavy metal leaching levels and hardness similar to commercial glass, which suggests they could be potentially used as construction aggregate substitutes. Incineration of sewage sludge before the vitrification process lead to increased hardness of the vitrificates and reduced leaching of some heavy metals.","","Available from http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.wasman.2014.08.022","","","","United States","2014-12-15T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: Waste Management; Journal Volume: 34; Journal Issue: 12; Other Information: Copyright (c) 2014 Elsevier Science B.V., Amsterdam, The Netherlands, All rights reserved.; Country of input: International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA)","","Medium: X; Size: page(s) 2520-2527","","","","Journal ID: ISSN 0956-053X; CODEN: WAMAE2; PII: S0956-053X(14)00377-8; TRN: US15R3180013103","10.1016/J.WASMAN.2014.08.022","","2016-03-10T00:00:00Z","22443562","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/22443562","","Waste Management","12","34"

The PC and ABS plastics show similar hydrophobicity, and ammonia treatment changes selectively floatability of PC plastic while ABS is insensitive to ammonia treatment. The contact angle measurement indicates the dropping of flotation recovery of PC is ascribed to a decline of contact angle. X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy demonstrates reactions occur on PC surface, which makes PC surface more hydrophilic. Separation of PC and ABS waste plastics was conducted based on the flotation behavior of single plastic. At different temperatures, PC and ABS mixtures were separated efficiently through froth flotation with ammonia pretreatment for different time (13 min at 23 °C, 18 min at 18 °C and 30 min at 23 °C). For both PC and ABS, the purity and recovery is more than 95.31% and 95.35%, respectively; the purity of PC and ABS is up to 99.72% and 99.23%, respectively. PC and ABS mixtures with different particle sizes were separated effectively, implying that ammonia treatment possesses superior applicability.","","Available from http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.wasman.2014.09.002","","","","United States","2014-12-15T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: Waste Management; Journal Volume: 34; Journal Issue: 12; Other Information: Copyright (c) 2014 Elsevier Science B.V., Amsterdam, The Netherlands, All rights reserved.; Country of input: International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA)","","Medium: X; Size: page(s) 2656-2661","","","","Journal ID: ISSN 0956-053X; CODEN: WAMAE2; PII: S0956-053X(14)00423-1; TRN: US15R3185013108","10.1016/J.WASMAN.2014.09.002","","2016-03-10T00:00:00Z","22443567","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/22443567","","Waste Management","12","34"

Unless managed properly, red mud poses significant risks to the local environment due to its extreme alkalinity and its potential impacts on surface and ground water quality. The ever-increasing generation of red mud poses significant challenges to the aluminium industries from management perspectives given the low proportion that are currently being utilized beneficially. Red mud, in most cases, contains elevated concentrations of iron in addition to aluminium, titanium, sodium and valuable rare earth elements. Given the scarcity of iron supply globally, the iron content of red mud has attracted increasing research interest. This paper presents a critical overview of the current techniques employed for iron recovery from red mud. Information on the recovery of other valuable metals is also reviewed to provide an insight into the full potential usage of red mud as an economic resource rather than a waste. Traditional hydrometallurgy and pyrometallurgy are being investigated continuously. However, in this review several new techniques are introduced that consider the process of iron recovery from red mud. An integrated process which can achieve multiple additional values from red mud is much preferred over the single process methods. The information provided here should help to improve the future management and utilization of red mud.","","Available from http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.wasman.2014.09.003","","","","United States","2014-12-15T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: Waste Management; Journal Volume: 34; Journal Issue: 12; Other Information: Copyright (c) 2014 Elsevier Science B.V., Amsterdam, The Netherlands, All rights reserved.; Country of input: International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA)","","Medium: X; Size: page(s) 2662-2673","","","","Journal ID: ISSN 0956-053X; CODEN: WAMAE2; PII: S0956-053X(14)00424-3; TRN: US15R3186013109","10.1016/J.WASMAN.2014.09.003","","2016-03-10T00:00:00Z","22443568","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/22443568","","Waste Management","12","34"

Leaching parameters were investigated and optimized in order to maximize the recovery of both vanadium and nickel. The independent leaching parameters investigated were liquid to solid ratio (S/L) (5–12.5 wt.%), temperature (45–80 °C), sulfuric acid concentration (5–25 v/v%) and leaching time (1–5 h). Response surface methodology (RSM) was used to optimize the process parameters. The most effective parameter on the recovery of both elements was found to be temperature and the least effective was time for V and acid concentration for Ni. Based on the results, optimum condition for metals recovery (actual recovery of ca.94% for V and 81% for Ni) was determined to be solid to liquid ratio of 9.15 wt.%, temperature of 80 °C, sulfuric acid concentration of 19.47 v/v% and leaching time of 2 h.

As an alternative, Ba(OH){sub 2}–Na{sub 2}SO{sub 4}–blast furnace slag composites are studied for immobilisation of sulfate-bearing nuclear wastes. Calcium aluminosilicate hydrate (C–A–S–H) with some barium substitution is the main binder phase, with barium also present in the low solubility salts BaSO{sub 4} and BaCO{sub 3}, along with Ba-substituted calcium sulfoaluminate hydrates, and a hydrotalcite-type layered double hydroxide. This reaction product assemblage indicates that Ba(OH){sub 2} and Na{sub 2}SO{sub 4} act as alkaline activators and control the reaction of the slag in addition to forming insoluble BaSO{sub 4}, and this restricts sulfate availability for further reaction as long as sufficient Ba(OH){sub 2} is added. An increased content of Ba(OH){sub 2} promotes a higher degree of reaction, and the formation of a highly cross-linked C–A–S–H gel. These Ba(OH){sub 2}–Na{sub 2}SO{sub 4}–blast furnace slag composite binders could be effective in the immobilisation of sulfate-bearing nuclear wastes.","","Available from http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.cemconres.2014.07.006","","","","United States","2014-12-15T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: Cement and Concrete Research; Journal Volume: 66; Other Information: Copyright (c) 2014 Elsevier Science B.V., Amsterdam, The Netherlands, All rights reserved.; Country of input: International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA)","","Medium: X; Size: page(s) 64-74","","","","Journal ID: ISSN 0008-8846; CODEN: CCNRAI; PII: S0008-8846(14)00140-9; TRN: US15R1542101630","10.1016/J.CEMCONRES.2014.07.006","","2015-11-05T00:00:00Z","22395933","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/22395933","","Cement and Concrete Research","","66"

This complexity reflects a socio-technical framing of the risks and social impacts associated with selecting technologies and sites for waste treatment and disposal facilities. Consequently there is growing pressure on local authorities for stakeholders (including communities) to be given an early opportunity to shape local waste policy in order to encourage swift planning, development and acceptance of the technologies needed to meet statutory targets to divert waste from landfill. This paper presents findings from a research project that explored the use of analytical–deliberative processes as a legitimising tool for waste management decision-making. Adopting a mixed methods approach, the study revealed that communicating the practical benefits of more inclusive forms of engagement is proving difficult even though planning and policy delays are hindering development and implementation of waste management infrastructure. Adopting analytical–deliberative processes at a more strategic level will require local authorities and practitioners to demonstrate how expert-citizen deliberations may foster progress in resolving controversial issues, through change in individuals, communities and institutions. The findings suggest that a significant shift in culture will be necessary for local authorities to realise the potential of more inclusive decision processes. This calls for political actors and civic society to collaborate in institutionalising public involvement in both strategic and local planning structures.","","Available from http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.wasman.2014.08.011","","","","United States","2014-12-15T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: Waste Management; Journal Volume: 34; Journal Issue: 12; Other Information: Copyright (c) 2014 Elsevier Science B.V., Amsterdam, The Netherlands, All rights reserved.; Country of input: International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA)","","Medium: X; Size: page(s) 2709-2726","","","","Journal ID: ISSN 0956-053X; CODEN: WAMAE2; PII: S0956-053X(14)00366-3; TRN: US15R3188013111","10.1016/J.WASMAN.2014.08.011","","2016-03-10T00:00:00Z","22443570","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/22443570","","Waste Management","12","34"

However, due to the formation of various alteration layers in the presence of water, it is difficult to conclusively deconvolute the mechanisms of ion exchange from other processes occurring simultaneously during corrosion. In this work, an operationally inert non-aqueous solution was used as an alkali source material to isolate ion exchange and study the solid-state diffusion of lithium. Specifically, the experiments involved contacting glass coupons relevant to the immobilization of high-level nuclear waste, SON68 and CJ-6, which contained Li in natural isotope abundance, with a non-aqueous solution of <sup>6</sup>LiCl dissolved in dimethyl sulfoxide at 90 °C for various time periods. The depth profiles of major elements in the glass coupons were measured using time-of-flight secondary ion mass spectrometry (ToF-SIMS). Lithium interdiffusion coefficients, D<sub>Li</sub>, were then calculated based on the measured depth profiles. The results indicate that the penetration of <sup>6</sup>Li is rapid in both glasses with the simplified CJ-6 glass (D<sub>6Li</sub> ≈ 4.0-8.0 × 10<sup>-21</sup> m<sup>2</sup>/s) exhibiting faster exchange than the more complex SON68 glass (D<sub>Li</sub> ≈ 2.0-4.0 × 10<sup>-21</sup> m<sup>2</sup>/s). Additionally, sodium ions present in the glass were observed to participate in ion exchange reactions; however, different diffusion coefficients were necessary to fit the diffusion profiles of the two alkali ions.

This has led to an increase of different research studies focusing on construction waste quantification. However, within the research studies made, packaging waste has been analyzed to a limited extent. This article focuses on the packaging waste stream generated in the construction sector. To this purpose current on-site waste packaging management has been assessed by monitoring ten Mediterranean residential building works. The findings of the experimental data collection revealed that the incentive measures implemented by the construction company to improve on-site waste sorting failed to achieve the intended purpose, showing low segregation ratios. Subsequently, through an analytical study the generation patterns for packaging waste are established, leading to the identification of the prevailing kinds of packaging and the products responsible for their generation. Results indicate that plastic waste generation maintains a constant trend throughout the whole construction process, while cardboard becomes predominant towards the end of the construction works with switches and sockets from the electricity stage. Understanding the production patterns of packaging waste will be beneficial for adapting waste management strategies to the identified patterns for the specific nature of packaging waste within the context of construction worksites.","","Available from http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.wasman.2014.06.020","","","","United States","2014-11-15T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: Waste Management; Journal Volume: 34; Journal Issue: 11; Other Information: Copyright (c) 2014 Elsevier Science B.V., Amsterdam, The Netherlands, All rights reserved.; Country of input: International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA)","","Medium: X; Size: page(s) 1932-1938","","","","Journal ID: ISSN 0956-053X; CODEN: WAMAE2; PII: S0956-053X(14)00276-1; TRN: US15R3150006252","10.1016/J.WASMAN.2014.06.020","","2016-03-04T00:00:00Z","22436809","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/22436809","","Waste Management","11","34"
"The impact of an efficient collection sites location on the zoning phase in municipal solid waste management","Ghiani, Gianpaolo; Manni, Andrea; Manni, Emanuele; Toraldo, Massimiliano","12 MANAGEMENT OF RADIOACTIVE WASTES, AND NON-RADIOACTIVE WASTES FROM NUCLEAR FACILITIES; 54 ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCES; ENVIRONMENTAL IMPACTS; GLOBAL ASPECTS; LAND USE; MUNICIPAL WASTES; PLANNING; SOLID WASTES; WASTE MANAGEMENT","Highlights: • We study the problems of locating collection areas and zoning the service territory in a municipal waste management system. • We investigate the impact that an efficient collection sites location has on the subsequent zoning phase. • On a real-world test case, we show that the proposed approach could allow achieving significant monetary savings. - Abstract: In this paper, we study two decisional problems arising when planning the collection of solid waste, namely the location of collection sites (together with bin allocation) and the zoning of the service territory, and we assess the potential impact that an efficient location has on the subsequent zoning phase. We first propose both an exact and a heuristic approach to locate the unsorted waste collection bins in a residential town, and to decide the capacities and characteristics of the bins to be located at each collection site. A peculiar aspect we consider is that of taking into account the compatibility between the different types of bins when allocating them to collection areas. Moreover, we propose a fast and effective heuristic approach to identify homogeneous zones that can be served by a single collection vehicle. Computational results on data related to a real-life instance show that an efficient location is fundamental in achieving consistent monetary savings, as well as a reduced environmental impact. These reductions are the result of one vehicle less needed to perform the waste collection operations, and an overall traveled distance reduced by about 25% on the average.","","Available from http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.wasman.2014.05.026","","","","United States","2014-11-15T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: Waste Management; Journal Volume: 34; Journal Issue: 11; Other Information: Copyright (c) 2014 Elsevier Science B.V., Amsterdam, The Netherlands, All rights reserved.; Country of input: International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA)","","Medium: X; Size: page(s) 1949-1956","","","","Journal ID: ISSN 0956-053X; CODEN: WAMAE2; PII: S0956-053X(14)00252-9; TRN: US15R3152006254","10.1016/J.WASMAN.2014.05.026","","2016-03-04T00:00:00Z","22436811","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/22436811","","Waste Management","11","34"

This paper presents empirical evidence spanning a broad time horizon (2002–2010) showing that economic and political factors impact in different ways on the provision of waste management services. We examine five alternatives in this area, including public and private service delivery formulas and, within each field, individual and joint options.

The present research was aimed to develop a novel, alternative separation opportunity, where the polymer fractions were separated by centrifugal force in melted state. The efficiency of the constructed separation equipment was verified by two immiscible plastics (polyethylene terephthalate, PET; low density polyethylene, LDPE), which have a high difference of density, and of which large quantities can also be found in the municipal solid waste. The results show that the developed equipment is suitable not only for separating dry blended mixtures of PET/LDPE into pure components again, but also for separating prefabricated polymer blends. By this process it becomes possible to recover pure polymer substances from multi-component products during the recycling process.

This knowledge may help define an optimal processing strategy for using these items as potential raw materials. Correct handling of such a waste is essential for its further “sustainable” recovery, especially to maximize the extraction of base, rare and precious metals, minimizing the environmental impact of the entire process chain. A combination of electronic and chemical imaging techniques was thus examined, applied and critically evaluated in order to optimize the processing, through the identification and the topological assessment of the materials of interest and their quantitative distribution. To reach this goal, end-of-life mobile phone derived wastes have been systematically characterized adopting both “traditional” (e.g. scanning electronic microscopy combined with microanalysis and Raman spectroscopy) and innovative (e.g. hyperspectral imaging in short wave infrared field) techniques, with reference to frames and printed circuit boards. Results showed as the combination of both the approaches (i.e. traditional and classical) could dramatically improve recycling strategies set up, as well as final products recovery.","","Available from http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.wasman.2014.06.003","","","","United States","2014-11-15T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: Waste Management; Journal Volume: 34; Journal Issue: 11; Other Information: Copyright (c) 2014 Elsevier Science B.V., Amsterdam, The Netherlands, All rights reserved.; Country of input: International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA)","","Medium: X; Size: page(s) 2120-2130","","","","Journal ID: ISSN 0956-053X; CODEN: WAMAE2; PII: S0956-053X(14)00258-X; TRN: US15R3159006260","10.1016/J.WASMAN.2014.06.003","","2016-03-04T00:00:00Z","22436817","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/22436817","","Waste Management","11","34"

Dealing with this kind of problems is generally done by landfilling and energy recovery. However, these two methods are becoming more and more expensive, hazardous to the public health and the environment. Therefore, recycling is gaining worldwide consideration as a solution to decrease the growing volume of plastic packaging wastes and simultaneously reduce the consumption of oil required to produce virgin resin. Nevertheless, a major shortage is encountered in recycling which is related to the sorting of plastic wastes. In this paper, a feasibility study was performed in order to test the potential of an innovative approach combining mid infrared (MIR) spectroscopy with independent components analysis (ICA), as a simple and fast approach which could achieve high separation rates. This approach (MIR-ICA) gave 100% discrimination rates in the separation of all studied plastics: polyethylene terephthalate (PET), polyethylene (PE), polypropylene (PP), polystyrene (PS) and polylactide (PLA). In addition, some more specific discriminations were obtained separating plastic materials belonging to the same polymer family e.g. high density polyethylene (HDPE) from low density polyethylene (LDPE). High discrimination rates were obtained despite the heterogeneity among samples especially differences in colors, thicknesses and surface textures. The reproducibility of the proposed approach was also tested using two spectrometers with considerable differences in their sensitivities. Discrimination rates were not affected proving that the developed approach could be extrapolated to different spectrometers. MIR combined with ICA is a promising tool for plastic waste separation that can help improve performance in this field; however further technological improvements and developments are required before it can be applied at an industrial level given that all tests presented here were performed under laboratory conditions.","","Available from http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.wasman.2014.06.015","","","","United States","2014-11-15T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: Waste Management; Journal Volume: 34; Journal Issue: 11; Other Information: Copyright (c) 2014 Elsevier Science B.V., Amsterdam, The Netherlands, All rights reserved.; Country of input: International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA)","","Medium: X; Size: page(s) 2131-2138","","","","Journal ID: ISSN 0956-053X; CODEN: WAMAE2; PII: S0956-053X(14)00271-2; TRN: US15R3160006261","10.1016/J.WASMAN.2014.06.015","","2016-03-04T00:00:00Z","22436818","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/22436818","","Waste Management","11","34"

This fairly new approach is a combination of combustion elemental analysis (CHNS) and a data reconciliation algorithm based on successive linearisation for evaluation of the analysis results. This method shows a great potential as an alternative way to determine the biomass content in SRF. However, the employed analytical technique (CHNS elemental analysis) restricts the probed sample mass to low amounts in the range of a few hundred milligrams. This requires sample comminution to small grain sizes (<200 μm) to generate representative SRF specimen. This is not easily accomplished for certain material mixtures (e.g. SRF with rubber content) by conventional means of sample size reduction. This paper presents a proof of principle investigation of the sample preparation and analysis of an SRF model mixture with the use of cryogenic impact milling (final sample comminution) and the adapted balance method (determination of biomass content). The so derived sample preparation methodology (cutting mills and cryogenic impact milling) shows a better performance in accuracy and precision for the determination of the biomass content than one solely based on cutting mills. The results for the determination of the biogenic fraction are within 1–5% of the data obtained by the reference methods, selective dissolution method (SDM) and {sup 14}C-method ({sup 14}C-M)","","Available from http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.wasman.2014.07.002","","","","United States","2014-11-15T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: Waste Management; Journal Volume: 34; Journal Issue: 11; Other Information: Copyright (c) 2014 Elsevier Science B.V., Amsterdam, The Netherlands, All rights reserved.; Country of input: International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA)","","Medium: X; Size: page(s) 2171-2175","","","","Journal ID: ISSN 0956-053X; CODEN: WAMAE2; PII: S0956-053X(14)00287-6; TRN: US15R3162006263","10.1016/J.WASMAN.2014.07.002","","2016-03-04T00:00:00Z","22436820","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/22436820","","Waste Management","11","34"

This paper analyses more than 20 years of landfill reduction in the Netherlands. The combination of landfill regulations, landfill tax and landfill bans resulted in the desired landfill reduction, but also had negative effects. A fierce competition developed over the remaining waste to be landfilled. In 2013 the Dutch landfill industry generated €40 million of annual revenue, had €58 million annual costs and therefore incurred an annual loss of €18 million. It is not an attractive option to prematurely end business. There is a risk that Dutch landfill operators will not be able to fulfil the financial obligations for closure and aftercare. Contrary to the polluter pays principle the burden may end up with society. EU regulations prohibiting export of waste for disposal are in place. Strong differentials in landfill tax rate between nations have nevertheless resulted in transboundary shipment of waste and in non-compliance with the self-sufficiency and proximity principles. During the transformation from a disposal society to a recycling society, it is important to carefully plan required capacity and to guide the reorganisation of the landfill sector. At some point, it is no longer profitable to provide landfill services. It may be necessary for public organisations or the state to take responsibility for the continued operation of a ‘safety net’ in waste management. Regulations have created a financial incentive to pass on the burden of monitoring and controlling the impact of waste to future generations. To prevent this, it is necessary to revise regulations on aftercare and create incentives to actively stabilise landfills.","","Available from http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.wasman.2014.05.019","","","","United States","2014-11-15T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: Waste Management; Journal Volume: 34; Journal Issue: 11; Other Information: Copyright (c) 2014 Elsevier Science B.V., Amsterdam, The Netherlands, All rights reserved.; Country of input: International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA)","","Medium: X; Size: page(s) 2218-2224","","","","Journal ID: ISSN 0956-053X; CODEN: WAMAE2; PII: S0956-053X(14)00245-1; TRN: US15R3165006266","10.1016/J.WASMAN.2014.05.019","","2016-03-04T00:00:00Z","22436823","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/22436823","","Waste Management","11","34"

We wanted to tackle the shortage of land for waste disposal that is a serious and growing problem in most large urban regions. The procedure combines a multi-criteria decision analysis (MCDA) approach with a geographical information system (GIS). The GIS was utilised to obtain an initial screening in order to eliminate unsuitable areas, whereas the MCDA was developed to select the most suitable sites. The novelty of the proposed siting procedure is the introduction of a new screening phase before the macro-siting step aimed at producing a “land use map of potentially suitable areas” for the siting of solid waste facilities which simultaneously takes into consideration all plant types. The issue of obtaining sites evaluations of a specific facility was coupled with the issue of not wasting land appropriate to facilitate other types of waste management options. In the developed case study, the use of an innovative criteria weighting tool (the “Priority Scale”) in combination with the Analytic Hierarchy Process was useful to easier define the priorities of the evaluation criteria in comparison with other classic methods such as the Paired Comparison Technique in combination with the Simple Additive Weighting method.","","Available from http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.wasman.2014.05.028","","","","United States","2014-11-15T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: Waste Management; Journal Volume: 34; Journal Issue: 11; Other Information: Copyright (c) 2014 Elsevier Science B.V., Amsterdam, The Netherlands, All rights reserved.; Country of input: International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA)","","Medium: X; Size: page(s) 2225-2238","","","","Journal ID: ISSN 0956-053X; CODEN: WAMAE2; PII: S0956-053X(14)00259-1; TRN: US15R3166006267","10.1016/J.WASMAN.2014.05.028","","2016-03-04T00:00:00Z","22436824","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/22436824","","Waste Management","11","34"

A series of single-phase batch mesophilic (35 ± 1 °C) anaerobic digestions were performed at a food waste concentration of 41.8 g VS/L. The results showed that inhibition of biogas production by volatile fatty acids (VFA) occurred without raw leachate addition. A certain amount of raw leachate in the reactors effectively relieved acidic inhibition caused by VFA accumulation, and the system maintained stable with methane yield of 369–466 mL/g VS. Total ammonia nitrogen introduced into the digestion systems with initial 2000–3000 mgNH{sub 4}–N/L not only replenished nitrogen for bacterial growth, but also formed a buffer system with VFA to maintain a delicate biochemical balance between the acidogenic and methanogenic microorganisms. UV spectroscopy and fluorescence excitation–emission matrix spectroscopy data showed that food waste was completely degraded. We concluded that using raw leachate for supplement water addition and pH modifier on anaerobic digestion of food waste was effective. An appropriate fraction of leachate could stimulate methanogenic activity and enhance biogas production.","","Available from http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.wasman.2014.06.014","","","","United States","2014-11-15T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: Waste Management; Journal Volume: 34; Journal Issue: 11; Other Information: Copyright (c) 2014 Elsevier Science B.V., Amsterdam, The Netherlands, All rights reserved.; Country of input: International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA)","","Medium: X; Size: page(s) 2278-2284","","","","Journal ID: ISSN 0956-053X; CODEN: WAMAE2; PII: S0956-053X(14)00270-0; TRN: US15R3168006269","10.1016/J.WASMAN.2014.06.014","","2016-03-04T00:00:00Z","22436826","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/22436826","","Waste Management","11","34"

A survey of four selected landfills in an arid region of South Australia was conducted to determine the proportion of e-waste in municipal waste and the properties of each landfill site. Leachate and groundwater samples were collected upgradient and downgradient of the landfills for analysis of polybrominated diphenyl ethers (PBDEs) and 14 metals and metalloids, including Al, As, Ba, Be, Cd, Co, Cr, Cu, Fe, Ni, Pb, Sb, V and Zn. Our data demonstrate that the selected landfills in South Australia continue to receive municipal waste containing in excess of 6%, or 25,000 tonnes per year, of e-waste. The leachates and groundwater collected from the landfills contained significantly elevated concentrations of Pb with the highest concentration in groundwater of 38 μg/l, almost four times higher than the Australian drinking water guideline of 10 μg/l. The presence of PBDEs was detected in both leachate and groundwater samples. Total PBDEs values of 2.13–59.75 ng/l in leachate samples were 10 times higher than in groundwater samples, which recorded a range of 0.41–6.53 ng/l at all sites. Moreover, the concentrations of metals and metalloids in sampled groundwater contained elevated levels of Al, As, Fe, Ni and Pb that exceeded Australian drinking water guideline values. For these reasons potential leaching of these contaminants is of concern and while difficult to attribute elevated contaminant levels to e-waste, we do not recommend continued disposal of e-waste in old landfills that were not originally designed to contain leachates. The survey also revealed temporal variation in the electrical conductivity and concentrations of As, Cd and Pb present in leachates of landfills in arid Mediterranean climates. These results are consistent with the marked variations in rainfall patterns observed for such climates. The solute concentration (EC and other ions including As, Cd and Pb) declines in the leachates during wet winter months (June to September), in contrast to tropical countries where such changes are observed during wet summer months.","","Available from http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.wasman.2014.06.018","","","","United States","2014-11-15T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: Waste Management; Journal Volume: 34; Journal Issue: 11; Other Information: Copyright (c) 2014 Elsevier Science B.V., Amsterdam, The Netherlands, All rights reserved.; Country of input: International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA)","","Medium: X; Size: page(s) 2292-2304","","","","Journal ID: ISSN 0956-053X; CODEN: WAMAE2; PII: S0956-053X(14)00274-8; TRN: US15R3169006270","10.1016/J.WASMAN.2014.06.018","","2016-03-04T00:00:00Z","22436827","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/22436827","","Waste Management","11","34"

However, due to the nature of the technology and presence of hazardous components such as lead, CRTs are the most challenging of electronic components to recycle. In the State of Delaware it is due to this challenge and the resulting expense combined with the large quantities of CRTs in the recycle stream that electronic recyclers now charge to accept Delaware’s e-waste. Therefore it is imperative that the Delaware Solid Waste Authority (DSWA) understand future quantities of CRTs entering the waste stream. This study presents the results of an assessment of CRT obsolescence in the State of Delaware. A prediction model was created utilizing publicized sales data, a variety of lifespan data as well as historic Delaware CRT collection rates. Both a deterministic and a probabilistic approach using Monte Carlo Simulation (MCS) were performed to forecast rates of CRT obsolescence to be anticipated in the State of Delaware. Results indicate that the peak of CRT obsolescence in Delaware has already passed, although CRTs are anticipated to enter the waste stream likely until 2033.","","Available from http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.wasman.2014.07.011","","","","United States","2014-11-15T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: Waste Management; Journal Volume: 34; Journal Issue: 11; Other Information: Copyright (c) 2014 Elsevier Science B.V., Amsterdam, The Netherlands, All rights reserved.; Country of input: International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA)","","Medium: X; Size: page(s) 2321-2326","","","","Journal ID: ISSN 0956-053X; CODEN: WAMAE2; PII: S0956-053X(14)00315-8; TRN: US15R3170006271","10.1016/J.WASMAN.2014.07.011","","2016-03-04T00:00:00Z","22436828","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/22436828","","Waste Management","11","34"

The waste by-products caused significant environmental impact. To lessen this hazardous effect from poisonous mine tailings, a feasible and cost-effective solution was conceived and implemented. Our approach focused on reutilization of the bauxite tailings by converting it to 4A zeolite for reuse in diverse applications. Three steps were involved in the bauxite conversion: wet-chemistry, alkali fusion, and crystallization to remove impurities and to prepare porous 4A zeolite. It was found that the cubic 4A zeolite was single phase, in high purity, with high crystallinity and well-defined structure. Importantly, the 4A zeolite displayed maximum calcium ion exchange capacity averaged at 296 mg CaCO{sub 3}/g, comparable to commercially-available zeolite (310 mg CaCO{sub 3}/g) exchange capacity. Base on the optimal synthesis condition, the reaction yield of zeolite 4A from bauxite tailings achieved to about 38.43%, hence, this study will provide a new paradigm for remediation of bauxite tailings, further mitigating the environmental and health care concerns, particularly in the mainland of PR China.","","Available from http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.wasman.2014.07.012","","","","United States","2014-11-15T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: Waste Management; Journal Volume: 34; Journal Issue: 11; Other Information: Copyright (c) 2014 Elsevier Science B.V., Amsterdam, The Netherlands, All rights reserved.; Country of input: International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA)","","Medium: X; Size: page(s) 2365-2372","","","","Journal ID: ISSN 0956-053X; CODEN: WAMAE2; PII: S0956-053X(14)00316-X; TRN: US15R3171006272","10.1016/J.WASMAN.2014.07.012","","2016-03-04T00:00:00Z","22436829","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/22436829","","Waste Management","11","34"

Source segregated waste was recycled and or/recovered by composting. Residual waste management options were by landfilling, incineration with energy recovery or solid recovered fuel (SRF) production to substitute for coal. The increase in fuel and materials consumption due to increase in SS had negligible influence on the environmental impact of the system. Recycling operations such as incineration and SRF were always advantageous for impact reduction. There was lower impact for an SS of 52% even though the difference with the SS intensity of 35% was quite limited, about 15%. In all the configurations analyzed, the best environmental performance was achieved for the management system producing SRF by the biodrying process.","","Available from http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.wasman.2014.06.007","","","","United States","2014-11-15T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: Waste Management; Journal Volume: 34; Journal Issue: 11; Other Information: Copyright (c) 2014 Elsevier Science B.V., Amsterdam, The Netherlands, All rights reserved.; Country of input: International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA)","","Medium: X; Size: page(s) 2382-2392","","","","Journal ID: ISSN 0956-053X; CODEN: WAMAE2; PII: S0956-053X(14)00263-3; TRN: US15R3172006273","10.1016/J.WASMAN.2014.06.007","","2016-03-04T00:00:00Z","22436830","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/22436830","","Waste Management","11","34"

Its successful implementation requires that the key operational parameters like earthworm stocking density be established for each target waste/waste mixture. One target waste mixture in South Africa is waste paper mixed with cow dung and rock phosphate (RP) for P enrichment. This study sought to establish optimal Eisenia fetida stocking density for maximum P release and rapid bioconversion of RP enriched cow dung–paper waste mixtures. E. fetida stocking densities of 0, 7.5, 12.5, 17.5 and 22.5 g-worms kg{sup −1} dry weight of cow dung–waste paper mixtures were evaluated. The stocking density of 12.5 g-worms kg{sup −1} resulted in the highest earthworm growth rate and humification of the RP enriched waste mixture as reflected by a C:N ratio of <12 and a humic acid/fulvic acid ratio of >1.9 in final vermicomposts. A germination test revealed that the resultant vermicompost had no inhibitory effect on the germination of tomato, carrot, and radish. Extractable P increased with stocking density up to 22.5 g-worm kg{sup −1} feedstock suggesting that for maximum P release from RP enriched wastes a high stocking density should be considered.","","Available from http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.wasman.2014.05.018","","","","United States","2014-11-15T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: Waste Management; Journal Volume: 34; Journal Issue: 11; Other Information: Copyright (c) 2014 Elsevier Science B.V., Amsterdam, The Netherlands, All rights reserved.; Country of input: International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA)","","Medium: X; Size: page(s) 2000-2006","","","","Journal ID: ISSN 0956-053X; CODEN: WAMAE2; PII: S0956-053X(14)00219-0; TRN: US15R3155009485","10.1016/J.WASMAN.2014.05.018","","2016-03-07T00:00:00Z","22439951","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/22439951","","Waste Management","11","34"

To design an adequate MSW management plan the first step consist in defining the waste generation and composition patterns of the town. As these patterns depend on several socio-economic factors it is advisable to organize them previously. Moreover, the waste generation and composition patterns may vary around the town and over the time. Generally, the data are not homogeneous around the city as the number of inhabitants is not constant nor it is the economic activity. Therefore, if all the information is showed in thematic maps, the final waste management decisions can be made more efficiently. The main aim of this paper is to present a structured methodology that allows local authorities or private companies who deal with MSW to design its own MSW management plan depending on the available data. According to these data, this paper proposes two ways of action: a direct way when detailed data are available and an indirect way when there is a lack of data and it is necessary to take into account bibliographic data. In any case, the amount of information needed is considerable. This paper combines the planning methodology with the Geographic Information Systems to present the final results in thematic maps that make easier to interpret them. The proposed methodology is a previous useful tool to organize the MSW collection routes including the selective collection.

The conservative nature of bromide, lithium and deuterium tracers was evaluated and linked to the presence of degradation in the sample. Lithium and deuterium tracers were non-conservative in the presence of degradation, whereas the bromide remained effectively conservative under all conditions. Solute diffusion times into and out of less mobile blocks of waste were compared for each test under the assumption of dominantly dual-porosity flow. Despite the fact that hydraulic conductivity changed strongly with applied stress, the block diffusion times were found to be much less sensitive to compression. A simple conceptual model, whereby flow is dominated by sub-parallel low permeability obstructions which define predominantly horizontally aligned less mobile zones, is able to explain this result. Compression tends to narrow the gap between the obstructions, but not significantly alter the horizontal length scale. Irrespective of knowledge of the true flow pattern, these results show that simple models of solute flushing from landfill which do not include depth dependent changes in solute transport parameters are justified.","","Available from http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.wasman.2014.06.022","","","","United States","2014-11-15T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: Waste Management; Journal Volume: 34; Journal Issue: 11; Other Information: Copyright (c) 2014 Elsevier Science B.V., Amsterdam, The Netherlands, All rights reserved.; Country of input: International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA)","","Medium: X; Size: page(s) 2196-2208","","","","Journal ID: ISSN 0956-053X; CODEN: WAMAE2; PII: S0956-053X(14)00278-5; TRN: US15R3164006265","10.1016/J.WASMAN.2014.06.022","","2016-03-04T00:00:00Z","22436822","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/22436822","","Waste Management","11","34"

By performing extensive molecular dynamics simulations, we disentangle the effects of amorphization and density, and show that a profound increase of solid-state diffusion takes place as a result of amorphization. Importantly, this can take place at the same density as in the crystal, representing an interesting general insight regarding solid-state diffusion. We find that decreasing the density in the amorphous system increases pre-factors of diffusion constants, but does not change the activation energy in the density range considered. We also find that atomic species in zirconolite are affected differently by amorphization and density change. Our microscopic insights are relevant for understanding how solid-state diffusion changes due to disorder and for building predictive models of operation of materials to be used to encapsulate nuclear waste.","","","","","","United States","2014-11-14T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: Journal of Applied Physics; Journal Volume: 116; Journal Issue: 18; Other Information: (c) 2014 AIP Publishing LLC; Country of input: International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA)","","Medium: X; Size: page(s) 184901-184901.6","","","","Journal ID: ISSN 0021-8979; CODEN: JAPIAU; TRN: US15A8076108399","10.1063/1.4901326","","2015-11-11T00:00:00Z","22402642","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/22402642","","Journal of Applied Physics","18","116"

Sorption kinetics were measured at two initial concentrations (C0; 1, 10 mM) and three soil:solution ratios (Rs/w; 0.005, 0.25, 2 kg/L) at pH 4.5 (pH of the saprolite). The rate of U loss from solution (mmole/L/h) increased with increasing Rs/w. Uranium sorption exhibited a fast phase with 80% sorption in the first eight hours for all C0 and Rs/w values and a slow phase during which the reaction slowly approached (pseudo) equilibrium over the next seven days. The pH-dependency of U sorption was apparent in pH sorption edges. U(VI) sorption increased over the pH range 4e6, then decreased sharply at pH > 7.5. U(VI) sorption edges were well described by a surface complexation model using calibrated parameters and the reaction network proposed by Waite et al. (1994). Sorption isotherms measured using the same Rs/w and pH values showed a solids concentration effect where U(VI) sorption capacity and affinity decreased with increasing solids concentration. Moreover, this effect may have been due to either particle aggregation or competition between U(VI) and exchangeable cations for sorption sites. The surface complexation model with calibrated parameters was able to predict the general sorption behavior relatively well, but failed to reproduce solid concentration effects, implying the importance of appropriate design if batch experiments are to be utilized for dynamic systems. Transport of U(VI) through the packed column was significantly retarded. We also conducted transport simulations using the reactive transport model HydroGeoChem (HGC) v5.0 that incorporated the surface complexation reaction network used to model the batch data. Model parameters reported by Waite et al. (1994) provided a better prediction of U transport than optimized parameters derived from our sorption edges. The results presented in this study highlight the challenges in defining appropriate conditions for batch-type experiments used to extrapolate parameters for transport models, and also underline a gap in our ability to transfer batch results to transport simulations.","Elsevier","","Oak Ridge National Lab.

"Recycling of high purity selenium from CIGS solar cell waste materials","Gustafsson, Anna M.K., E-mail: anna.gustafsson@chalmers.se; Foreman, Mark R.StJ.; Ekberg, Christian","37 INORGANIC, ORGANIC, PHYSICAL AND ANALYTICAL CHEMISTRY; 12 MANAGEMENT OF RADIOACTIVE WASTES, AND NON-RADIOACTIVE WASTES FROM NUCLEAR FACILITIES; COPPER; CRYSTALS; GALLIUM SELENIDES; INDIUM SELENIDES; MATERIALS RECOVERY; OXIDATION; OXYGEN; PRICES; RECYCLING; REDUCING AGENTS; SELENIUM; SOLAR CELLS; SULFUR DIOXIDE; THIN FILMS; WASTES","Highlights: • A new method for recycling of selenium from CIGS solar cell materials is presented. • Separation of selenium as selenium dioxide after heating in oxygen atmosphere. • Complete selenium separation after oxidation of <63 μm particles at 800 °C for 1 h. • After reduction of selenium dioxide the selenium purity was higher than 99.999 wt%. - Abstract: Copper indium gallium diselenide (CIGS) is a promising material in thin film solar cell production. To make CIGS solar cells more competitive, both economically and environmentally, in comparison to other energy sources, methods for recycling are needed. In addition to the generally high price of the material, significant amounts of the metals are lost in the manufacturing process. The feasibility of recycling selenium from CIGS through oxidation at elevated temperatures was therefore examined. During oxidation gaseous selenium dioxide was formed and could be separated from the other elements, which remained in solid state. Upon cooling, the selenium dioxide sublimes and can be collected as crystals. After oxidation for 1 h at 800 °C all of the selenium was separated from the CIGS material. Two different reduction methods for reduction of the selenium dioxide to selenium were tested. In the first reduction method an organic molecule was used as the reducing agent in a Riley reaction. In the second reduction method sulphur dioxide gas was used. Both methods resulted in high purity selenium. This proves that the studied selenium separation method could be the first step in a recycling process aimed at the complete separation and recovery of high purity elements from CIGS.","","Available from http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.wasman.2013.12.021","","","","United States","2014-10-15T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","Conference","Journal Name: Waste Management; Journal Volume: 34; Journal Issue: 10; Conference: CRETE 2012: 3. international conference on industrial and hazardous waste management, Chania (Greece), 12-14 Sep 2012; Other Information: Copyright (c) 2014 Elsevier Science B.V., Amsterdam, The Netherlands, All rights reserved.; Country of input: International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA)","","Medium: X; Size: page(s) 1775-1782","","","","Journal ID: ISSN 0956-053X; CODEN: WAMAE2; PII: S0956-053X(14)00006-3; TRN: US15R3142006244","10.1016/J.WASMAN.2013.12.021","","2016-03-04T00:00:00Z","22436801","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/22436801","","Waste Management","10","34"

Printed circuit boards (PCBs) are among the most complex e-waste, containing significant quantities of hazardous and toxic materials leading to high levels of pollution if landfilled or processed inappropriately. However, PCBs are also an important resource of metals including copper, tin, lead and precious metals; their recycling is appealing especially as the concentration of these metals in PCBs is considerably higher than in their ores. This article is focused on a novel approach to recover copper rich phases from waste PCBs. Crushed PCBs were heat treated at 1150 °C under argon gas flowing at 1 L/min into a horizontal tube furnace. Samples were placed into an alumina crucible and positioned in the cold zone of the furnace for 5 min to avoid thermal shock, and then pushed into the hot zone, with specimens exposed to high temperatures for 10 and 20 min. After treatment, residues were pulled back to the cold zone and kept there for 5 min to avoid thermal cracking and re-oxidation. This process resulted in the generation of a metallic phase in the form of droplets and a carbonaceous residue. The metallic phase was formed of copper-rich red droplets and tin-rich white droplets along with the presence of several precious metals. The carbonaceous residue was found to consist of slag and ∼30% carbon. The process conditions led to the segregation of hazardous lead and tin clusters in the metallic phase. The heat treatment temperature was chosen to be above the melting point of copper; molten copper helped to concentrate metallic constituents and their separation from the carbonaceous residue and the slag. Inert atmosphere prevented the re-oxidation of metals and the loss of carbon in the gaseous fraction. Recycling e-waste is expected to lead to enhanced metal recovery, conserving natural resources and providing an environmentally sustainable solution to the management of waste products.","","Available from http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.wasman.2014.05.004","","","","United States","2014-10-15T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","Conference","Journal Name: Waste Management; Journal Volume: 34; Journal Issue: 10; Conference: CRETE 2012: 3. international conference on industrial and hazardous waste management, Chania (Greece), 12-14 Sep 2012; Other Information: Copyright (c) 2014 Elsevier Science B.V., Amsterdam, The Netherlands, All rights reserved.; Country of input: International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA)","","Medium: X; Size: page(s) 1783-1792","","","","Journal ID: ISSN 0956-053X; CODEN: WAMAE2; PII: S0956-053X(14)00204-9; TRN: US15R3143006245","10.1016/J.WASMAN.2014.05.004","","2016-03-04T00:00:00Z","22436802","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/22436802","","Waste Management","10","34"

They are re-used in various ways, particularly in road and earth constructions, substituting primary resources such as gravel. However, they may also contain pollutants, such as heavy metals, which may be leached to the groundwater. The toxic impacts of these emissions are so far often neglected within Life Cycle Assessments (LCA) of products or waste treatment services and thus, potentially large environmental impacts are currently missed. This study aims at closing this gap by assessing the ecotoxic impacts of heavy metal leaching from industrial mineral wastes in road and earth constructions. The flows of metals such as Sb, As, Pb, Cd, Cr, Cu, Mo, Ni, V and Zn originating from three typical constructions to the environment are quantified, their fate in the environment is assessed and potential ecotoxic effects evaluated. For our reference country, Germany, the industrial wastes that are applied as Granular Secondary Construction Material (GSCM) carry more than 45,000 t of diverse heavy metals per year. Depending on the material quality and construction type applied, up to 150 t of heavy metals may leach to the environment within the first 100 years after construction. Heavy metal retardation in subsoil can potentially reduce the fate to groundwater by up to 100%. One major challenge of integrating leaching from constructions into macro-scale LCA frameworks is the high variability in micro-scale technical and geographical factors, such as material qualities, construction types and soil types. In our work, we consider a broad range of parameter values in the modeling of leaching and fate. This allows distinguishing between the impacts of various road constructions, as well as sites with different soil properties. The findings of this study promote the quantitative consideration of environmental impacts of long-term leaching in Life Cycle Assessment, complementing site-specific risk assessment, for the design of waste management strategies, particularly in the construction sector.","","Available from http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.wasman.2014.04.022","","","","United States","2014-10-15T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","Conference","Journal Name: Waste Management; Journal Volume: 34; Journal Issue: 10; Conference: CRETE 2012: 3. international conference on industrial and hazardous waste management, Chania (Greece), 12-14 Sep 2012; Other Information: Copyright (c) 2014 Elsevier Science B.V., Amsterdam, The Netherlands, All rights reserved.; Country of input: International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA)","","Medium: X; Size: page(s) 1884-1896","","","","Journal ID: ISSN 0956-053X; CODEN: WAMAE2; PII: S0956-053X(14)00180-9; TRN: US15R3148006250","10.1016/J.WASMAN.2014.04.022","","2016-03-04T00:00:00Z","22436807","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/22436807","","Waste Management","10","34"

This paper deals with analysis of adsorption storage systems adopting the flow through cooling concept. By this approach the feeding hydrogen provides the needed cold to maintain the tank at low temperatures. Two adsorption systems have been examined and modeled adopting the Dubinin-Astakhov model, to see their performance under selected operating conditions. A first case has been analyzed, modeling a storage tank filled with carbon based material (namely MaxSorb®) and comparing the numerical outcomes with the available experimental results for a 2.5 L tank. Under selected operating conditions (minimum inlet hydrogen temperature of approximately 100 K and maximum pressure on the order of 8.5 MPa) and adopting the flow through cooling concept the material shows a gravimetric capacity of about 5.7 %. A second case has been modeled, examining the same tank filled with metal organic framework material (MOF5®) under approximately the same conditions. The model shows that the latter material can achieve a (material) gravimetric capacity on the order of 11%, making the system potentially able to achieve the DOE 2017 target.","Elsevier","","Savannah River Site (SRS), Aiken, SC (United States)","USDOE Office of Environmental Management (EM)","","United States","2014-10-13T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: International Journal of Hydrogen Energy; Journal Volume: 39; Journal Issue: 30","","Medium: ED; Size: p. 17083-17091","","SRNL-STI-2014-00382","AC09-08SR22470","Journal ID: ISSN 0360-3199","10.1016/j.ijhydene.2014.08.029","","2016-06-20T00:00:00Z","1171507","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/1171507","https://www.osti.gov/servlets/purl/1171507","International Journal of Hydrogen Energy","30","39"

Due to their typical driving cycle, these vehicles are characterized by large fuel consumption, which strongly affects the overall waste disposal costs. Hybrid hydraulic refuse vehicles offer an interesting alternative to conventional diesel trucks, because they are able to recuperate, store and reuse braking energy. However, the expected fuel savings can vary strongly depending on the driving cycle and the operational mode. Therefore, in order to assess the possible fuel savings, a typical driving cycle was measured in a conventional vehicle run by the waste authority of the City of Stuttgart, and a dynamical model of the considered vehicle was built up. Based on the measured driving cycle and the vehicle model including the hybrid powertrain components, simulations for both the conventional and the hybrid vehicle were performed. Fuel consumption results that indicate savings of about 20% are presented and analyzed in order to evaluate the benefit of hybrid hydraulic vehicles used for refuse collection.","","Available from http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.wasman.2014.05.022","","","","United States","2014-09-15T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: Waste Management; Journal Volume: 34; Journal Issue: 9; Other Information: Copyright (c) 2014 Elsevier Science B.V., Amsterdam, The Netherlands, All rights reserved.; Country of input: International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA)","","Medium: X; Size: page(s) 1577-1583","","","","Journal ID: ISSN 0956-053X; CODEN: WAMAE2; PII: S0956-053X(14)00248-7; TRN: US15R3208013130","10.1016/J.WASMAN.2014.05.022","","2016-03-10T00:00:00Z","22443589","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/22443589","","Waste Management","9","34"

The in-bed calculations provided 2-D profiles of the gas–solid temperatures and the gas species concentrations along the bed length, which were then used as inlet conditions for the out-of-bed computations. The over-bed simulations provided the profiles of incident radiation heat flux on the top of bed. A 3-dimensional benchmark simulation was conducted with a 750 t/day commercial incinerator using the present coupling scheme incorporating with a reduced SNCR reduction mechanism. Numerical tests were performed to investigate the effects of operating parameters such as injection position, injection speed and the normalized stoichiometric ratio (NSR) on the SNCR performance. The simulation results showed that the distributions of gas velocity, temperature and NO{sub x} concentration were highly non-uniform, which made the injection position one of the most sensitive operating parameters influencing the SNCR performance of moving grate incinerators. The simulation results also showed that multi-layer injections were needed to meet the EU2000 standard, and a NSR 1.5 was suggested as a compromise of a satisfactory NO{sub x} reduction and reasonable NH{sub 3} slip rates. This work provided useful guides to the design and operation of SNCR process in moving-grate incinerators.","","Available from http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.wasman.2014.04.015","","","","United States","2014-09-15T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: Waste Management; Journal Volume: 34; Journal Issue: 9; Other Information: Copyright (c) 2014 Elsevier Science B.V., Amsterdam, The Netherlands, All rights reserved.; Country of input: International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA)","","Medium: X; Size: page(s) 1609-1618","","","","Journal ID: ISSN 0956-053X; CODEN: WAMAE2; PII: S0956-053X(14)00155-X; TRN: US15R3209013131","10.1016/J.WASMAN.2014.04.015","","2016-03-10T00:00:00Z","22443590","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/22443590","","Waste Management","9","34"

With respect to leachate management, this study investigates “gateway” indicators for functional stability in terms of the predictability of leachate characteristics, and thus potential threat to water quality posed by leachate emissions. Historical studies conducted on changes in municipal solid waste (MSW) leachate concentrations over time (longitudinal analysis) have concentrated on indicator compounds, primarily chemical oxygen demand (COD) and biochemical oxygen demand (BOD). However, validation of these studies using an expanded database and larger constituent sets has not been performed. This study evaluated leachate data using a mixed-effects regression model to determine the extent to which leachate constituent degradation can be predicted based on waste age or operational practices. The final dataset analyzed consisted of a total of 1402 samples from 101 MSW landfills. Results from the study indicated that all leachate constituents exhibit a decreasing trend with time in the post-closure period, with 16 of the 25 target analytes and aggregate classes exhibiting a statistically significant trend consistent with well-studied indicators such as BOD. Decreasing trends in BOD concentration after landfill closure can thus be considered representative of trends for many leachate constituents of concern.","","Available from http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.wasman.2014.05.016","","","","United States","2014-09-15T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: Waste Management; Journal Volume: 34; Journal Issue: 9; Other Information: Copyright (c) 2014 Elsevier Science B.V., Amsterdam, The Netherlands, All rights reserved.; Country of input: International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA)","","Medium: X; Size: page(s) 1674-1682","","","","Journal ID: ISSN 0956-053X; CODEN: WAMAE2; PII: S0956-053X(14)00217-7; TRN: US15R3211013133","10.1016/J.WASMAN.2014.05.016","","2016-03-10T00:00:00Z","22443592","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/22443592","","Waste Management","9","34"

In literature, various methods have been employed to quantify the C and D waste generation at both regional and project levels. However, an integrated review that systemically describes and analyses all the existing methods has yet to be conducted. To bridge this research gap, an analytical review is conducted. Fifty-seven papers are retrieved based on a set of rigorous procedures. The characteristics of the selected papers are classified according to the following criteria - waste generation activity, estimation level and quantification methodology. Six categories of existing C and D waste quantification methodologies are identified, including site visit method, waste generation rate method, lifetime analysis method, classification system accumulation method, variables modelling method and other particular methods. A critical comparison of the identified methods is given according to their characteristics and implementation constraints. Moreover, a decision tree is proposed for aiding the selection of the most appropriate quantification method in different scenarios.

It has also been applied to assess the environmental performance related to waste management activities. This study analyses the packaging waste management system of a local public authority in Portugal. The operations of selective and refuse collection, sorting, recycling, landfilling and incineration of packaging waste were considered. The packaging waste management system in operation in 2010, which we called “Baseline” scenario, was compared with two hypothetical scenarios where all the packaging waste that was selectively collected in 2010 would undergo the refuse collection system and would be sent directly to incineration (called “Incineration” scenario) or to landfill (“Landfill” scenario). Overall, the results show that the “Baseline” scenario is more environmentally sound than the hypothetical scenarios.","","Available from http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.wasman.2014.05.007","","","","United States","2014-09-15T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: Waste Management; Journal Volume: 34; Journal Issue: 9; Other Information: Copyright (c) 2014 Elsevier Science B.V., Amsterdam, The Netherlands, All rights reserved.; Country of input: International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA)","","Medium: X; Size: page(s) 1725-1735","","","","Journal ID: ISSN 0956-053X; CODEN: WAMAE2; PII: S0956-053X(14)00207-4; TRN: US15R3215013137","10.1016/J.WASMAN.2014.05.007","","2016-03-10T00:00:00Z","22443596","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/22443596","","Waste Management","9","34"

A safety issue after the closure of a geological repository is that biodegradation of organic materials due to microbial activities generates gases that lead to overpressure of the waste containers in the repository and its disintegration with the release of radionuclides. As part of an ongoing large-scale in situ experiment using organic wastes and groundwater to simulate geological radioactive waste repository conditions, we investigated the geochemical alteration and microbial activities at an early stage (~63 days) intended to be representative of the initial period after repository closure. The increased numbers of both aerobes and facultative anaerobes in waste effluents indicate that oxygen content could be the most significant parameter to control biogeochemical conditions at very early periods of reaction (<35 days). Accordingly, the values of dissolved oxygen and redox potential were decreased. The activation of anaerobes after 35 days was supported by the increased concentration to ~50 mg L-1 of ethanol. These results suggest that the biogeochemical conditions were rapidly altered to more reducing and anaerobic conditions within the initial 2 months after repository closure. Although no gases were detected during the study, activated anaerobic microbes will play more important role in gas generation over the long term.","Elsevier","","Pacific Northwest National Lab.

However, the major economic driving force for recycling of WEEE is the value of the metallic fractions (MFs). The non-metallic fractions (NMFs), which take up a large proportion of E-wastes, were treated by incineration or landfill in the past. NMFs from WEEE contain heavy metals, brominated flame retardant (BFRs) and other toxic and hazardous substances. Combustion as well as landfill may cause serious environmental problems. Therefore, research on resource reutilization and safe disposal of the NMFs from WEEE has a great significance from the viewpoint of environmental protection. Among the enormous variety of NMFs from WEEE, some of them are quite easy to recycle while others are difficult, such as plastics, glass and NMFs from waste printed circuit boards (WPCBs). In this paper, we mainly focus on the intractable NMFs from WEEE. Methods and technologies of recycling the two types of NMFs from WEEE, plastics, glass are reviewed in this paper. For WEEE plastics, the pyrolysis technology has the lowest energy consumption and the pyrolysis oil could be obtained, but the containing of BFRs makes the pyrolysis recycling process problematic. Supercritical fluids (SCF) and gasification technology have a potentially smaller environmental impact than pyrolysis process, but the energy consumption is higher. With regard to WEEE glass, lead removing is requisite before the reutilization of the cathode ray tube (CRT) funnel glass, and the recycling of liquid crystal display (LCD) glass is economically viable for the containing of precious metals (indium and tin). However, the environmental assessment of the recycling process is essential and important before the industrialized production stage. For example, noise and dust should be evaluated during the glass cutting process. This study could contribute significantly to understanding the recycling methods of NMFs from WEEE and serve as guidance for the future technology research and development.","","Available from http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.wasman.2014.03.004","","","","United States","2014-08-15T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: Waste Management; Journal Volume: 34; Journal Issue: 8; Other Information: Copyright (c) 2014 Elsevier Science B.V., Amsterdam, The Netherlands, All rights reserved.; Country of input: International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA)","","Medium: X; Size: page(s) 1455-1469","","","","Journal ID: ISSN 0956-053X; CODEN: WAMAE2; PII: S0956-053X(14)00094-4; TRN: US15R3203013125","10.1016/J.WASMAN.2014.03.004","","2016-03-10T00:00:00Z","22443584","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/22443584","","Waste Management","8","34"

This study aimed at determining the toxic metals content of motherboards (printed circuit boards), monitor glass and monitor plastic housing of two Cathode Ray Tube (CRT) monitors, three Liquid Crystal Display (LCD) monitors, one LCD touch screen monitor and six motherboards, all of which were discarded. In addition, concentrations of chromium (Cr), cadmium (Cd), lead (Pb) and mercury (Hg) were compared with the respective limits set by the RoHS 2002/95/EC Directive, that was recently renewed by the 2012/19/EU recast, in order to verify manufacturers’ compliance with the regulation. The research included disassembly, pulverization, digestion and chemical analyses of all the aforementioned devices. The toxic metals content of all samples was determined using Inductively Coupled Plasma-Mass Spectrometry (ICP-MS). The results demonstrated that concentrations of Pb in motherboards and funnel glass of devices with release dates before 2006, that is when the RoHS Directive came into force, exceeded the permissible limit. In general, except from Pb, higher metal concentrations were detected in motherboards in comparison with plastic housing and glass samples. Finally, the results of this work were encouraging, since concentrations of metals referred in the RoHS Directive were found in lower levels than the legislative limits.","","Available from http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.wasman.2014.04.020","","","","United States","2014-08-15T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: Waste Management; Journal Volume: 34; Journal Issue: 8; Other Information: Copyright (c) 2014 Elsevier Science B.V., Amsterdam, The Netherlands, All rights reserved.; Country of input: International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA)","","Medium: X; Size: page(s) 1480-1487","","","","Journal ID: ISSN 0956-053X; CODEN: WAMAE2; PII: S0956-053X(14)00160-3; TRN: US15R3204013126","10.1016/J.WASMAN.2014.04.020","","2016-03-10T00:00:00Z","22443585","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/22443585","","Waste Management","8","34"

Co-digestion of fish waste silage (FWS) and cow manure (CM) was studied in two parallel laboratory-scale (8 L effective volume) semi-continuous stirred tank reactors (designated R1 and R2). A reactor fed with CM only (R0) was used as control. The reactors were operated in the mesophilic range (37 °C) with a hydraulic retention time of 30 days, and the entire experiment lasted for 450 days. The rate of organic loading was raised by increasing the content of FWS in the feed stock. During the experiment, the amount (volume%) of FWS was increased stepwise in the following order: 3% – 6% – 13% – 16%, and 19%. Measurements of methane production, and analysis of volatile fatty acids, ammonium and pH in the effluents were carried out. The highest methane production from co-digestion of FWS and CM was 0.400 L CH4 gVS{sup −1}, obtained during the period with loading of 16% FWS in R2. Compared to anaerobic digestion of CM only, the methane production was increased by 100% at most, when FWS was added to the feed stock. The biogas processes failed in R1 and R2 during the periods, with loadings of 16% and 19% FWS, respectively. In both reactors, the biogas processes failed due to overloading and accumulation of ammonia and volatile fatty acids.","","Available from http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.wasman.2014.04.011","","","","United States","2014-08-15T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: Waste Management; Journal Volume: 34; Journal Issue: 8; Other Information: Copyright (c) 2014 Elsevier Science B.V., Amsterdam, The Netherlands, All rights reserved.; Country of input: International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA)","","Medium: X; Size: page(s) 1553-1559","","","","Journal ID: ISSN 0956-053X; CODEN: WAMAE2; PII: S0956-053X(14)00151-2; TRN: US15R3207013129","10.1016/J.WASMAN.2014.04.011","","2016-03-10T00:00:00Z","22443588","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/22443588","","Waste Management","8","34"

In our study, the cumulative GHG emitted from the storage ponds and process configurations that manage fresh or aged landfill leachate were investigated. Our results showed that strong CH{sub 4} emissions were observed from the fresh leachate storage pond, with the fluxes values (2219–26,489 mg C m{sup −2} h{sup −1}) extremely higher than those of N{sub 2}O (0.028–0.41 mg N m{sup −2} h{sup −1}).

The uses of these elements, especially for high-tech products are increased in recent years and combined with the scarcity of the resources and the environmental impact of the technologies to extract them from ores make the recycling waste, that contain Y and other RE, a priority. The present review summarized the main hydrometallurgical technologies to extract Y from ores, contaminated solutions, WEEE and generic wastes. Before to discuss the works about the treatment of wastes, the processes to retrieval Y from ores are discussed, since the processes are similar and derived from those already developed for the extraction from primary sources. Particular attention was given to the recovery of Y from WEEE because the recycle of them is important not only for economical point of view, considering its value, but also for environmental impact that this could be generated if not properly disposal.","","Available from http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.wasman.2014.02.010","","","","United States","2014-07-15T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: Waste Management; Journal Volume: 34; Journal Issue: 7; Other Information: Copyright (c) 2014 Elsevier Science B.V., Amsterdam, The Netherlands, All rights reserved.; Country of input: International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA)","","Medium: X; Size: page(s) 1237-1250","","","","Journal ID: ISSN 0956-053X; CODEN: WAMAE2; PII: S0956-053X(14)00062-2; TRN: US15R3194013117","10.1016/J.WASMAN.2014.02.010","","2016-03-10T00:00:00Z","22443576","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/22443576","","Waste Management","7","34"

But their significant disadvantage is disposal of spent lamps because of containing a few milligrams of toxic metals, especially mercury and lead. For a successful implementation of any waste management plan, availability of sufficient and accurate information on quantities and compositions of the generated waste and current management conditions is a fundamental prerequisite. In this study, CFLs were selected among 20 different brands in Iran. Content of heavy metals including mercury, lead, nickel, arsenic and chromium was determined by inductive coupled plasma (ICP). Two cities, Tehran and Tabriz, were selected for assessing the current waste management condition of CFLs. The study found that waste generation amount of CFLs in the country was about 159.80, 183.82 and 153.75 million per year in 2010, 2011 and 2012, respectively. Waste generation rate of CFLs in Iran was determined to be 2.05 per person in 2012. The average amount of mercury, lead, nickel, arsenic and chromium was 0.417, 2.33, 0.064, 0.056 and 0.012 mg per lamp, respectively. Currently, waste of CFLs is disposed by municipal waste stream in waste landfills. For improving the current conditions, we propose by considering the successful experience of extended producer responsibility (EPR) in other electronic waste management. The EPR program with advanced recycling fee (ARF) is implemented for collecting and then recycling CFLs. For encouraging consumers to take the spent CFLs back at the end of the products’ useful life, a proportion of ARF (for example, 50%) can be refunded. On the other hand, the government and Environmental Protection Agency should support and encourage recycling companies of CFLs both technically and financially in the first place.","","Available from http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.wasman.2014.03.010","","","","United States","2014-07-15T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: Waste Management; Journal Volume: 34; Journal Issue: 7; Other Information: Copyright (c) 2014 Elsevier Science B.V., Amsterdam, The Netherlands, All rights reserved.; Country of input: International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA)","","Medium: X; Size: page(s) 1251-1256","","","","Journal ID: ISSN 0956-053X; CODEN: WAMAE2; PII: S0956-053X(14)00101-9; TRN: US15R3195013118","10.1016/J.WASMAN.2014.03.010","","2016-03-10T00:00:00Z","22443577","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/22443577","","Waste Management","7","34"

Chemical risks were assessed in fluorescent lamp recycling facilities by field measurement surveys in France, highlighting that occupational exposure and pollutant levels in the working environment were correlated with the main recycling steps and processes. The mean levels of worker exposure are 4.4 mg/m{sup 3}, 15.4 μg/m{sup 3}, 14.0 μg/m{sup 3}, 247.6 μg/m{sup 3}, respectively, for total inhalable dust, mercury, lead and yttrium. The mean levels of airborne pollutants are 3.1 mg/m{sup 3}, 9.0 μg/m{sup 3}, 9.0 μg/m{sup 3}, 219.2 μg/m{sup 3}, respectively, for total inhalable dust, mercury, lead and yttrium. The ranges are very wide. Surface samples from employees’ skin and granulometric analysis were also carried out. The overview shows that all the stages and processes involved in lamp recycling are concerned by the risk of hazardous substances penetrating into the bodies of employees, although exposure of the latter varies depending on the processes and tasks they perform. The conclusion of this study strongly recommends the development of a new generation of processes in parallel with more information sharing and regulatory measures.","","Available from http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.wasman.2014.03.023","","","","United States","2014-07-15T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: Waste Management; Journal Volume: 34; Journal Issue: 7; Other Information: Copyright (c) 2014 Elsevier Science B.V., Amsterdam, The Netherlands, All rights reserved.; Country of input: International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA)","","Medium: X; Size: page(s) 1257-1263","","","","Journal ID: ISSN 0956-053X; CODEN: WAMAE2; PII: S0956-053X(14)00132-9; TRN: US15R3196013119","10.1016/J.WASMAN.2014.03.023","","2016-03-10T00:00:00Z","22443578","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/22443578","","Waste Management","7","34"

More parts were stripped from PCB of PC, composed of epoxy resin; than from PCB of household appliance, composed of phenol resin. In an attempt to raise the copper grade of PCB by removing other components, a carbonization treatment was investigated. The crushed PCB without surface-mounted parts was carbonized under a nitrogen atmosphere at 873–1073 K. After screening, the char was classified by size into oversized pieces, undersized pieces and powder. The copper foil and glass fiber pieces were liberated and collected in undersized fraction. The copper foil was liberated easily from glass fiber by stamping treatment. As one of the mounted parts, the multi-layered ceramic capacitors (MLCCs), which contain nickel, were carbonized at 873 K. The magnetic separation is carried out at a lower magnetic field strength of 0.1 T and then at 0.8 T. In the +0.5 mm size fraction the nickel grade in magnetic product was increased from 0.16% to 6.7% and the nickel recovery is 74%. The other useful mounted parts are tantalum capacitors. The tantalum capacitors were collected from mounted parts. The tantalum-sintered bodies were separated from molded resins by heat treatment at 723–773 K in air atmosphere and screening of 0.5 mm. Silica was removed and 70% of tantalum grade was obtained after more than 823 K heating and separation. Next, the evaluation of Cu recycling in PCB is estimated. Energy consumption of new process increased and the treatment cost becomes 3 times higher comparing the conventional process, while the environmental burden of new process decreased comparing conventional process. The nickel recovery process in fine ground particles increased energy and energy cost comparing those of the conventional process. However, the environmental burden decreased than the conventional one. The process for recovering tantalum used more heat for the treatment and therefore the energy consumption increased by 50%, when comparing with conventional process. However, the market price for tantalum is very large; the profit for tantalum recovery is added. Also the environmental burden decreased by the recycling of tantalum recovery. Therefore, the tantalum recovery is very important step in the PCB recycling. If there is no tantalum, the consumed energy and treatment cost increase in the new process, though the environmental burden decreases.","","Available from http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.wasman.2014.03.002","","","","United States","2014-07-15T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: Waste Management; Journal Volume: 34; Journal Issue: 7; Other Information: Copyright (c) 2014 Elsevier Science B.V., Amsterdam, The Netherlands, All rights reserved.; Country of input: International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA)","","Medium: X; Size: page(s) 1264-1273","","","","Journal ID: ISSN 0956-053X; CODEN: WAMAE2; PII: S0956-053X(14)00092-0; TRN: US15R3197017114","10.1016/J.WASMAN.2014.03.002","","2016-03-14T00:00:00Z","22447572","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/22447572","","Waste Management","7","34"

The effect of increasing the volatile solid (VS) concentration of lipid from 0% to 75% was investigated. BMP tests showed that lipids in municipal biomass waste could enhance the methane production. The results of bench-scale tests showed that a lipids concentration of 65% of total VS was the inhibition concentration. Methane yields increased with increasing lipid concentration when lipid concentrations were below 60%, but when lipid concentration was set as 65% or higher, methane yields decreased sharply. When lipid concentrations were below 60%, the pH values were in the optimum range for the growth of methanogenic bacteria and the ratios of volatile fatty acid (VFA)/alkalinity were in the range of 0.2–0.6. When lipid concentrations exceeded 65%, the pH values were below 5.2, the reactor was acidized and the values of VFA/alkalinity rose to 2.0. The amount of Brevibacterium decreased with increasing lipid content. Long chain fatty acids stacked on the methanogenic bacteria and blocked the mass transfer process, thereby inhibiting anaerobic digestion.","","Available from http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.wasman.2013.07.018","","","","United States","2014-06-01T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: Waste Management; Journal Volume: 34; Journal Issue: 6; Other Information: Copyright (c) 2013 Elsevier Science B.V., Amsterdam, The Netherlands, All rights reserved.; Country of input: International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA)","","Medium: X; Size: page(s) 1025-1034","","","","Journal ID: ISSN 0956-053X; CODEN: WAMAE2; PII: S0956-053X(13)00346-2; TRN: US15R1049026584","10.1016/J.WASMAN.2013.07.018","","2015-03-31T00:00:00Z","22320382","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/22320382","","Waste Management","6","34"

The single-phase reactor (SPR) was a conventional reactor operated at a low loading rate (maximum of 3.5 kg VS/m{sup 3} d), while the two-phase system consisted of an acidification reactor (TPAR) and a methanogenic reactor (TPMR). The TPAR was inoculated with methanogenic sludge similar to the SPR, but was operated with step-wise increase in the loading rate and with total recirculation of reactor solids to convert it into acidification sludge. Before each feeding, part of the sludge from TPAR was centrifuged, the centrifuge liquid (solubilized products) was fed to the TPMR and centrifuged solids were recycled back to the reactor. Single-phase digestion produced a methane yield of 0.45 m{sup 3} CH{sub 4}/kg VS fed and VS removal of 83%. The TPAR shifted to acidification mode at an OLR of 10.0 kg VS/m{sup 3} d and then achieved stable performance at 7.0 kg VS/m{sup 3} d and pH 5.5–6.2, with very high substrate solubilization rate and a methane yield of 0.30 m{sup 3} CH{sub 4}/kg COD fed. The two-phase process was capable of high VS reduction, but material and energy balance showed that the single-phase process was superior in terms of volumetric methane production and energy yield by 33%. The lower energy yield of the two-phase system was due to the loss of energy during hydrolysis in the TPAR and the deficit in methane production in the TPMR attributed to COD loss due to biomass synthesis and adsorption of hard COD onto the flocs. These results including the complicated operational procedure of the two-phase process and the economic factors suggested that the single-phase process could be the preferred system for FVW.","","Available from http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.wasman.2014.02.023","","","","United States","2014-05-01T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: Waste Management; Journal Volume: 34; Journal Issue: 5; Other Information: Copyright (c) 2014 Elsevier Science B.V., Amsterdam, The Netherlands, All rights reserved.; Country of input: International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA)","","Medium: X; Size: page(s) 875-885","","","","Journal ID: ISSN 0956-053X; CODEN: WAMAE2; PII: S0956-053X(14)00075-0; TRN: US15R1041026580","10.1016/J.WASMAN.2014.02.023","","2015-03-31T00:00:00Z","22320378","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/22320378","","Waste Management","5","34"
"Using social network and stakeholder analysis to help evaluate infectious waste management: A step towards a holistic assessment","Caniato, Marco; Vaccari, Mentore; Visvanathan, Chettiyappan; Zurbrügg, Christian; Eawag: Swiss Federal Institute of Aquatic Science and Technology, Department of Water and Sanitation in Developing Countries (Sandec), Ueberlandstrasse 133, 8600 Duebendorf (Switzerland)]","12 MANAGEMENT OF RADIOACTIVE WASTES, AND NON-RADIOACTIVE WASTES FROM NUCLEAR FACILITIES; COMBUSTION; ENVIRONMENT; POLLUTION CONTROL; SOLID WASTES; WASTE INCINERATORS; WASTE MANAGEMENT","Highlights: • Assessment of infectious waste management in Bangkok, in particular incineration. • Integration of social network and stakeholder analysis assessment methods. • Assessment of stakeholder characteristics, role, interaction and communication. • Interviewees self-evaluate their own characteristics and the system. • Non-technical aspects are important for system acceptability, and sustainability. - Abstract: Assessing the strengths and weaknesses of a solid waste management scheme requires an accurate analysis and integration of several determining features. In addition to the technical aspects, any such system shows a complex interaction of actors with varying stakes, decision-making power and influence, as well as a favourable or disabling environment. When capitalizing on the knowledge and experience from a specific case, it is also crucial that experts do not “forget” or underestimate the importance of such social determinants and that they are familiar with the methods and tools to assess them. Social network analysis (SNA) and stakeholder analysis (SA) methods can be successfully applied to better understand actors’ role and actions, analyse driving forces and existing coordination among stakeholders, as well as identify bottlenecks in communication which affect daily operations or strategic planning for the future way forward. SNA and SA, appropriately adjusted for a certain system, can provide a useful integration to methods by assessing other aspects to ensure a comprehensive picture of the situation. This paper describes how to integrate SNA and SA in order to survey a solid waste management system. This paper presents the results of an analysis of On-Nuch infectious waste incinerator in Bangkok, Thailand. Stakeholders were interviewed and asked to prioritize characteristics and relationships which they consider particularly important for system development and success of the scheme. In such a way, a large quantity of information about organization, communication between stakeholders and their perception about operation, environmental and health impact, and potential alternatives for the system was collected in a systematic way. The survey results suggest that stakeholders are generally satisfied with the system operation, though communication should be improved. Moreover, stakeholders should be strategically more involved in system development planning, according to their characteristics, to prevent negative reactions.","","Available from http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.wasman.2014.02.011","","","","United States","2014-05-01T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: Waste Management; Journal Volume: 34; Journal Issue: 5; Other Information: Copyright (c) 2014 Elsevier Science B.V., Amsterdam, The Netherlands, All rights reserved.; Country of input: International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA)","","Medium: X; Size: page(s) 938-951","","","","Journal ID: ISSN 0956-053X; CODEN: WAMAE2; PII: S0956-053X(14)00063-4; TRN: US15R1044026583","10.1016/J.WASMAN.2014.02.011","","2015-03-31T00:00:00Z","22320381","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/22320381","","Waste Management","5","34"

The facility also for anticipation of future needs to provide national facility for the servicing of radwaste management of non-nuclear power plant activity in Serpong Nuclear Area. It is needs to study the material of buffer and backfill for the safety of demonstration plant facility. A local bentonite rock from Cidadap-Tasikmalaya was used as the buffer materials. Objective of experiment is to find out the specific data of sorption characteristic of Cidadap bentonite as buffer material in a radwaste disposal system. Experiments were performed in batch method, where bentonite samples were contacted with CsCl solution labeled with Cs-137 in 100 ml/g liquid:solid ratio. Initial Cs concentration was 10{sup −8} M and to study the effects of ionic strength and Cs concentration in solution, 0.1 and 1.0 M NaCl also CsCl concentration ranging 10{sup −8} - 10{sup −4} M were added in solution. As the indicator of Cs saturated in bentonite samples, Kd value was applied. Affected parameters in the experiment were contact time, effects of ionic strength and concentration of CsCl. Results showed that sorption of Cs by bentonite reached constantly after 16 days contacted, and Kd value was 10.600 ml/g. Effect of CsCl concentration on Kd value may decreased in increased in CsCl concentration. Effect of ionic strength increased according to increased in concentration of background and would effect to Kd value due to competition of Na ions and Cs in solution interacts with bentonite. By obtaining the bentonite character data as buffer material, the results could be used as the basis for making of design and the basic of performance assessment the near surface disposal facility in terms of isolation capacity of radwaste later.","","","","","","United States","2014-03-24T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","Conference","Journal Name: AIP Conference Proceedings; Journal Volume: 1589; Journal Issue: 1; Conference: ICMNS 2012: 4. international conference on mathematics and natural sciences: Science for health, food and sustainable energy, Bandung (Indonesia), 8-9 Nov 2012; Other Information: (c) 2014 AIP Publishing LLC; Country of input: International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA)","","Medium: X; Size: page(s) 346-349","","","","Journal ID: ISSN 0094-243X; CODEN: APCPCS; TRN: US14A4626087211","10.1063/1.4868816","","2014-09-26T00:00:00Z","22265981","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/22265981","","AIP Conference Proceedings","1","1589"

By quantifying environmental impacts of systems, life cycle assessment (LCA) is a tool, which can contribute to answer that call. But how, where and to which extent has it been applied to solid waste management systems (SWMSs) until now, and which lessons can be learnt from the findings of these LCA applications? To address these questions, we performed a critical review of 222 published LCA studies of SWMS. We first analysed the geographic distribution and found that the published studies have primarily been concentrated in Europe with little application in developing countries. In terms of technological coverage, they have largely overlooked application of LCA to waste prevention activities and to relevant waste types apart from household waste, e.g. construction and demolition waste. Waste management practitioners are thus encouraged to abridge these gaps in future applications of LCA. In addition to this contextual analysis, we also evaluated the findings of selected studies of good quality and found that there is little agreement in the conclusions among them. The strong dependence of each SWMS on local conditions, such as waste composition or energy system, prevents a meaningful generalisation of the LCA results as we find it in the waste hierarchy. We therefore recommend stakeholders in solid waste management to regard LCA as a tool, which, by its ability of capturing the local specific conditions in the modelling of environmental impacts and benefits of a SWMS, allows identifying critical problems and proposing improvement options adapted to the local specificities.","","Available from http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.wasman.2013.10.045","","","","United States","2014-03-01T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: Waste Management; Journal Volume: 34; Journal Issue: 3; Other Information: Copyright (c) 2013 Elsevier Science B.V., Amsterdam, The Netherlands, All rights reserved.; Country of input: International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA)","","Medium: X; Size: page(s) 573-588","","","","Journal ID: ISSN 0956-053X; CODEN: WAMAE2; PII: S0956-053X(13)00559-X; TRN: US15R1033026577","10.1016/J.WASMAN.2013.10.045","","2015-03-31T00:00:00Z","22320375","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/22320375","","Waste Management","3","34"

However, the quality of the provided support to decision- and policy-makers is strongly dependent on a proper conduct of the LCA. How has LCA been applied until now? Are there any inconsistencies in the past practice? To answer these questions, we draw on a critical review of 222 published LCA studies of solid waste management systems. We analyse the past practice against the ISO standard requirements and the ILCD Handbook guidelines for each major step within the goal definition, scope definition, inventory analysis, impact assessment, and interpretation phases of the methodology. Results show that malpractices exist in several aspects of the LCA with large differences across studies. Examples are a frequent neglect of the goal definition, a frequent lack of transparency and precision in the definition of the scope of the study, e.g. an unclear delimitation of the system boundaries, a truncated impact coverage, difficulties in capturing influential local specificities such as representative waste compositions into the inventory, and a frequent lack of essential sensitivity and uncertainty analyses. Many of these aspects are important for the reliability of the results. For each of them, we therefore provide detailed recommendations to practitioners of waste management LCAs.","","Available from http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.wasman.2013.12.004","","","","United States","2014-03-01T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: Waste Management; Journal Volume: 34; Journal Issue: 3; Other Information: Copyright (c) 2013 Elsevier Science B.V., Amsterdam, The Netherlands, All rights reserved.; Country of input: International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA)","","Medium: X; Size: page(s) 589-606","","","","Journal ID: ISSN 0956-053X; CODEN: WAMAE2; PII: S0956-053X(13)00571-0; TRN: US15R1034026578","10.1016/J.WASMAN.2013.12.004","","2015-03-31T00:00:00Z","22320376","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/22320376","","Waste Management","3","34"

Mechanical properties were determined both by in situ and laboratory large-scale one dimensional compression tests. While among in situ tests, Dilatomer Marchetti Tests (DMT) is used widely in measuring soil properties, the adoption of the DMT for the measurements of MSW properties has not often been documented in literature. To validate its applicability for the estimation of MSW properties, a comparison between the seismic dilatometer (SDMT) results and the waste properties evaluated by laboratory tests was carried out. Parameters for “fresh” and “degraded waste” have been evaluated. These preliminary results seems to be promising as concerns the assessment of the friction angle of waste and the evaluation of the S-wave in terms of shear wave velocity. Further studies are certainly required to obtain more representative values of the elastic parameters according to the SDMT measurements.","","Available from http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.wasman.2013.10.026","","","","United States","2014-02-15T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: Waste Management; Journal Volume: 34; Journal Issue: 2; Other Information: Copyright (c) 2013 Elsevier Science B.V., Amsterdam, The Netherlands, All rights reserved.; Country of input: International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA)","","Medium: X; Size: page(s) 256-265","","","","Journal ID: ISSN 0956-053X; CODEN: WAMAE2; PII: S0956-053X(13)00512-6; TRN: US14R3417010780","10.1016/J.WASMAN.2013.10.026","","2015-01-30T00:00:00Z","22304608","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/22304608","","Waste Management","2","34"

A number of integrated systems and methods have introduced to overcome this challenge. Many researchers have aimed to develop an ideal SWM system, including approaches involving software-based routing, Geographic Information Systems (GIS), Radio-frequency Identification (RFID), or sensor intelligent bins. Image processing solutions for the Solid Waste (SW) collection have also been developed; however, during capturing the bin image, it is challenging to position the camera for getting a bin area centralized image. As yet, there is no ideal system which can correctly estimate the amount of SW. This paper briefly discusses an efficient image processing solution to overcome these problems. Dynamic Time Warping (DTW) was used for detecting and cropping the bin area and Gabor wavelet (GW) was introduced for feature extraction of the waste bin image. Image features were used to train the classifier. A Multi-Layer Perceptron (MLP) classifier was used to classify the waste bin level and estimate the amount of waste inside the bin. The area under the Receiver Operating Characteristic (ROC) curves was used to statistically evaluate classifier performance. The results of this developed system are comparable to previous image processing based system. The system demonstration using DTW with GW for feature extraction and an MLP classifier led to promising results with respect to the accuracy of waste level estimation (98.50%). The application can be used to optimize the routing of waste collection based on the estimated bin level.","","Available from http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.wasman.2013.10.030","","","","United States","2014-02-15T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: Waste Management; Journal Volume: 34; Journal Issue: 2; Other Information: Copyright (c) 2013 Elsevier Science B.V., Amsterdam, The Netherlands, All rights reserved.; Country of input: International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA)","","Medium: X; Size: page(s) 281-290","","","","Journal ID: ISSN 0956-053X; CODEN: WAMAE2; PII: S0956-053X(13)00516-3; TRN: US14R3418010781","10.1016/J.WASMAN.2013.10.030","","2015-01-30T00:00:00Z","22304609","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/22304609","","Waste Management","2","34"

Combining different types of biodegradable solid waste it is possible to obtain a substrate eligible to microorganisms in the composting process. In this work the composting of apple and tobacco solid waste mixture (1:7, dry weight) was explored. The aim of the work was to investigate an efficiency of biodegradation of the given mixture and to characterize incurred raw compost. Composting was conducted in 24 L thermally insulated column reactor at airflow rate of 1.1 L min{sup −1}. During 22 days several parameters were closely monitored: temperature and mass of the substrate, volatile solids content, C/N ratio and pH-value of the mixture and oxygen consumption. The composting of the apple and tobacco waste resulted with high degradation of the volatile solids (53.1%). During the experiment 1.76 kg of oxygen was consumed and the C/N ratio of the product was 11.6. The obtained temperature curve was almost a “mirror image” of the oxygen concentration curve while the peak values of the temperature were occurred 9.5 h after the peak oxygen consumption.","","Available from http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.wasman.2013.11.001","","","","United States","2014-02-15T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: Waste Management; Journal Volume: 34; Journal Issue: 2; Other Information: Copyright (c) 2013 Elsevier Science B.V., Amsterdam, The Netherlands, All rights reserved.; Country of input: International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA)","","Medium: X; Size: page(s) 323-328","","","","Journal ID: ISSN 0956-053X; CODEN: WAMAE2; PII: S0956-053X(13)00531-X; TRN: US14R3421010784","10.1016/J.WASMAN.2013.11.001","","2015-01-30T00:00:00Z","22304612","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/22304612","","Waste Management","2","34"

This approach is not a sustainable use of our water and energy resources. In addition, in the U.S., there is a shortfall in funding for maintenance and upgrade of the water and wastewater infrastructures. The goal of this paper was to review the current knowledge on composting toilets since this technology is decentralized, requires no water, creates a value product (fertilizer) and can possibly reduce the burden on the current infrastructure as a sustainable sanitation approach. We found a large variety of composting toilet designs and categorized the different types of toilets as being self contained or central; single or multi chamber; waterless or with water/foam flush, electric or non-electric, and no-mix or combined collection. Factors reported as affecting the composting process and their optimum values were identified as; aeration, moisture content (50–60%), temperature (40–65 °C), carbon to nitrogen ratio (25–35), pH (5.5–8.0), and porosity (35–50%). Mass and energy balance models have been created for the composting process. However there is a literature gap in the use of this knowledge in design and operation of composting toilets. To evaluate the stability and safety of compost for use as fertilizer, various methods are available and the temperature–time criterion approach is the most common one used. There are many barriers to the use of composting toilets in urban settings including public acceptance, regulations, and lack of knowledge and experience in composting toilet design and operation and program operation.","","Available from http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.wasman.2013.10.006","","","","United States","2014-02-15T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: Waste Management; Journal Volume: 34; Journal Issue: 2; Other Information: Copyright (c) 2013 Elsevier Science B.V., Amsterdam, The Netherlands, All rights reserved.; Country of input: International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA)","","Medium: X; Size: page(s) 329-343","","","","Journal ID: ISSN 0956-053X; CODEN: WAMAE2; PII: S0956-053X(13)00492-3; TRN: US14R3422010785","10.1016/J.WASMAN.2013.10.006","","2015-01-30T00:00:00Z","22304613","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/22304613","","Waste Management","2","34"
"An LCA model for waste incineration enhanced with new technologies for metal recovery and application to the case of Switzerland","Boesch, Michael E.; Vadenbo, Carl; Saner, Dominik; Huter, Christoph; Hellweg, Stefanie","54 ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCES; 12 MANAGEMENT OF RADIOACTIVE WASTES, AND NON-RADIOACTIVE WASTES FROM NUCLEAR FACILITIES; 42 ENGINEERING; CARBON DIOXIDE; CLIMATIC CHANGE; COMBUSTION; COMPUTER CODES; ELECTRICITY; ENERGY BALANCE; ENERGY RECOVERY; ENVIRONMENTAL IMPACTS; EXERGY; FLUE GAS; FLY ASH; INCINERATORS; MATERIALS RECOVERY; METALS; SANITARY LANDFILLS; SOLID WASTES; STEAM; SWITZERLAND; WASTE HEAT; WASTE TRANSPORTATION","Highlights: • An enhanced process-based LCA model for MSWI is featured and applied in case study. • LCA modeling of recent technological developments for metal recovery from fly ash. • Net release from Swiss MSWI 133 kg CO{sub 2}-eq/tonne waste from attributional LCA perspective. • Net savings from a consequential LCA perspective reach up to 303 kg CO{sub 2}-eq/tonne waste. • Impacts according to ReCiPe and CExD show similar pattern to climate change. - Abstract: A process model of municipal solid waste incinerators (MSWIs) and new technologies for metal recovery from combustion residues was developed. The environmental impact is modeled as a function of waste composition as well as waste treatment and material recovery technologies. The model includes combustion with a grate incinerator, several flue gas treatment technologies, electricity and steam production from waste heat recovery, metal recovery from slag and fly ash, and landfilling of residues and can be tailored to specific plants and sites (software tools can be downloaded free of charge). Application of the model to Switzerland shows that the treatment of one tonne of municipal solid waste results on average in 425 kg CO{sub 2}-eq. generated in the incineration process, and 54 kg CO{sub 2}-eq. accrue in upstream processes such as waste transport and the production of operating materials. Downstream processes, i.e. residue disposal, generates 5 kg CO{sub 2}-eq. Savings from energy recovery are in the range of 67 to 752 kg CO{sub 2}-eq. depending on the assumptions regarding the substituted energy production, while the recovery of metals from slag and fly ash currently results in a net saving of approximately 35 kg CO{sub 2}-eq. A similar impact pattern is observed when assessing the MSWI model for aggregated environmental impacts (ReCiPe) and for non-renewable resource consumption (cumulative exergy demand), except that direct emissions have less and no relevance, respectively, on the total score. The study illustrates that MSWI plants can be an important element of industrial ecology as they provide waste disposal services and can help to close material and energetic cycles.","","Available from http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.wasman.2013.10.019","","","","United States","2014-02-15T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: Waste Management; Journal Volume: 34; Journal Issue: 2; Other Information: Copyright (c) 2013 Elsevier Science B.V., Amsterdam, The Netherlands, All rights reserved.; Country of input: International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA)","","Medium: X; Size: page(s) 378-389","","","","Journal ID: ISSN 0956-053X; CODEN: WAMAE2; PII: S0956-053X(13)00505-9; TRN: US14R3425010788","10.1016/J.WASMAN.2013.10.019","","2015-01-30T00:00:00Z","22304616","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/22304616","","Waste Management","2","34"

In the first case, CRT recycling is addressed to the recovery of the panel and funnel glass for the manufacturing of new CRT screens. In the second case, where flat screen technology has replaced that of CRT, the recycling is addressed to the recovery of the glass cullet and lead for other applications. The impacts were evaluated according to the problem-oriented methodology of the Institute of Environmental Sciences, Leiden University, Leiden, The Netherlands. Our data confirm that in both cases, the recycling treatment allows benefits to be gained for the environment through the recovery of the secondary raw materials. These benefits are higher for the “CRT technology” framework (1 kg CO{sub 2} saved per CRT) than for the “flat screen technology” (0.9 kg CO{sub 2} saved, per CRT, as the highest possible), mainly due to the high energy consumption for lead separation from the funnel glass. Furthermore, the recovery of yttrium from the fluorescent powders that are a residue of the recycling treatment would further improve the CO{sub 2} credit for both the frameworks considered, which would provide a further saving of about 0.75 kg CO{sub 2} per CRT, net of the energy and raw materials needed for the recovery. Overall, this study confirms that, even with a change in the destination of the recovered materials, the recycling processes provide a benefit for the environment: indeed the higher loads for the environment are balanced by avoiding the primary production of the recovered materials.","","Available from http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.wasman.2013.10.031","","","","United States","2014-02-15T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: Waste Management; Journal Volume: 34; Journal Issue: 2; Other Information: Copyright (c) 2013 Elsevier Science B.V., Amsterdam, The Netherlands, All rights reserved.; Country of input: International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA)","","Medium: X; Size: page(s) 468-474","","","","Journal ID: ISSN 0956-053X; CODEN: WAMAE2; PII: S0956-053X(13)00517-5; TRN: US14R3428010791","10.1016/J.WASMAN.2013.10.031","","2015-01-30T00:00:00Z","22304619","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/22304619","","Waste Management","2","34"

So, nowadays, it is necessary to consider the useful life, recycling, and final disposal of these equipment. Metals, such as Au, Ag, Cu, Sn and Ni can be found in the printed circuit boards (PCB). According to this, the aims of this work is to characterize the PCBs of mobile phones with aqua regia; obtaining “reference” values of leaching, to gold and silver, with cyanide and nitric acid, respectively; and study the process of leaching of these metals in alternative leaching with sodium thiosulfate and ammonium thiosulfate. The metals were characterized by digesting the sample with aqua regia for 1 and 2 h at 60 °C and 80 °C. The leaching of Au with a commercial reagent (cyanide) and the Ag with HNO{sub 3}were made. The leaching of Au and Ag with alternative reagents: Na{sub 2}S{sub 2}O{sub 3,} and (NH{sub 4}){sub 2}S{sub 2}O{sub 3} in 0.1 M concentration with the addition of CuSO{sub 4}, NH{sub 4}OH, and H{sub 2}O{sub 2}, was also studied. The results show that the digestion with aqua regia was efficient to characterize the metals present in the PCBs of mobile phones. However, the best method to solubilize silver was by digesting the sample with nitric acid. The leaching process using sodium thiosulfate was more efficient when an additional concentration of 0.015 and 0.030 M of the CuSO{sub 4} was added.","","Available from http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.wasman.2013.10.032","","","","United States","2014-02-15T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: Waste Management; Journal Volume: 34; Journal Issue: 2; Other Information: Copyright (c) 2013 Elsevier Science B.V., Amsterdam, The Netherlands, All rights reserved.; Country of input: International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA)","","Medium: X; Size: page(s) 475-482","","","","Journal ID: ISSN 0956-053X; CODEN: WAMAE2; PII: S0956-053X(13)00518-7; TRN: US14R3429010792","10.1016/J.WASMAN.2013.10.032","","2015-01-30T00:00:00Z","22304620","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/22304620","","Waste Management","2","34"

The pyrolytic oil yield was in the range of 41.3–79.5 wt% depending on the temperature, the type and the amount of catalyst. The non-catalytic fast pyrolysis at 500 °C gives the highest yield of bio-oil (79.5 wt%). The higher temperature of catalytic pyrolysis of cellulose/polyethylene mixture the higher yield of bio-oil is. Contrarily, increasing amount of montmorillonite results in significant, almost linear decrease in bio-oil yield followed by a significant increase of gas yield. The addition of clay catalysts to CPE mixture has a various influence on the distribution of bio-oil components. The addition of montmorillonite K10 to cellulose/polyethylene mixture promotes the deepest conversion of polyethylene and cellulose. Additionally, more saturated than unsaturated hydrocarbons are present in resultant bio-oils. The proportion of liquid hydrocarbons is the highest when a montmorillonite K10 is acting as a catalyst.","","Available from http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.wasman.2013.10.036","","","","United States","2014-02-15T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: Waste Management; Journal Volume: 34; Journal Issue: 2; Other Information: Copyright (c) 2013 Elsevier Science B.V., Amsterdam, The Netherlands, All rights reserved.; Country of input: International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA)","","Medium: X; Size: page(s) 504-512","","","","Journal ID: ISSN 0956-053X; CODEN: WAMAE2; PII: S0956-053X(13)00522-9; TRN: US14R3432010795","10.1016/J.WASMAN.2013.10.036","","2015-01-30T00:00:00Z","22304623","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/22304623","","Waste Management","2","34"

Asbestos fiber concentration were below the quantitation limit in all samples, and total fiber concentrations were determined as 47–170 × 10{sup 6} g{sup −1}. - Abstract: Appropriate treatment of asbestos-containing wastes is a significant problem. In Japan, the inertization of asbestos-containing wastes based on new treatment processes approved by the Minister of the Environment is promoted. A highly sensitive method for testing asbestos fibers in inertized materials is required so that these processes can be approved. We developed a method in which fibers from milled treated materials are extracted in water by shaking, and are counted and identified by transmission electron microscopy. Evaluation of this method by using asbestos standards and simulated slag samples confirmed that the quantitation limits are a few million fibers per gram and a few μg/g in a sample of 50 mg per filter. We used this method to assay asbestos fibers in slag samples produced by high-temperature melting of asbestos-containing wastes. Fiber concentrations were below the quantitation limit in all samples, and total fiber concentrations were determined as 47–170 × 10{sup −6} f/g. Because the evaluation of treated materials by TEM is difficult owing to the limited amount of sample observable, this testing method should be used in conjunction with bulk analytical methods for sure evaluation of treated materials.","","Available from http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.wasman.2013.11.008","","","","United States","2014-02-15T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: Waste Management; Journal Volume: 34; Journal Issue: 2; Other Information: Copyright (c) 2013 Elsevier Science B.V., Amsterdam, The Netherlands, All rights reserved.; Country of input: International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA)","","Medium: X; Size: page(s) 536-541","","","","Journal ID: ISSN 0956-053X; CODEN: WAMAE2; PII: S0956-053X(13)00561-8; TRN: US14R3433010796","10.1016/J.WASMAN.2013.11.008","","2015-01-30T00:00:00Z","22304624","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/22304624","","Waste Management","2","34"

The changes in packaging waste management were mainly implemented since the Directive 94/62/EC on packaging and packaging waste entered into force. The analysis of the five systems allowed the authors to identify very different approaches to cope with the same problem: meet the recovery and recycling targets imposed by EU law. Packaging waste is a responsibility of the industry. However, local governments are generally in charge of waste management, particularly in countries with Green Dot schemes or similar extended producer responsibility systems. This leads to the need of establishing a system of financial transfers between the industry and the local governments (particularly regarding the extra costs involved with selective collection and sorting). Using the same methodological approach, the authors also compare the costs and benefits of recycling from the perspective of local public authorities for France, Portugal and Romania. Since the purpose of the current paper is to take note of who is paying for the incremental costs of recycling and whether the industry (i.e. the consumer) is paying for the net financial costs of packaging waste management, environmental impacts are not included in the analysis. The work carried out in this paper highlights some aspects that are prone to be improved and raises several questions that will require further research. In the three countries analyzed more closely in this paper the industry is not paying the net financial cost of packaging waste management. In fact, if the savings attained by diverting packaging waste from other treatment (e.g. landfilling) and the public subsidies to the investment on the “recycling system” are not considered, it seems that the industry should increase the financial support to local authorities (by 125% in France, 50% in Portugal and 170% in Romania). However, in France and Portugal the industry is paying local authorities more than just the incremental costs of recycling (full costs of selective collection and sorting minus the avoided costs). To provide a more definitive judgment on the fairness of the systems it will be necessary to assess the cost efficiency of waste management operators (and judge whether operators are claiming costs or eliciting “prices”)","","Available from http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.wasman.2013.10.035","","","","United States","2014-02-15T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: Waste Management; Journal Volume: 34; Journal Issue: 2; Other Information: Copyright (c) 2013 Elsevier Science B.V., Amsterdam, The Netherlands, All rights reserved.; Country of input: International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA)","","Medium: X; Size: page(s) 298-308","","","","Journal ID: ISSN 0956-053X; CODEN: WAMAE2; PII: S0956-053X(13)00521-7; TRN: US14R3419010782","10.1016/J.WASMAN.2013.10.035","","2015-01-30T00:00:00Z","22304610","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/22304610","","Waste Management","2","34"

Bahir Dar in northwestern Ethiopia outsourced municipal waste services to a private waste company in 2008. While this institutional change has led to substantial improvement in the cleanliness of the city, its financial sustainability remains unclear. Is the private company able to generate sufficient revenues from their activities to offset the costs and generate some profit? This paper presents a cost-revenue analysis, based on data from July 2009 to June 2011. The analysis reveals that overall costs in Bahir Dar’s SWM system increased significantly during this period, mainly due to rising costs related to waste transportation. On the other hand, there is only one major revenue stream in place: the waste collection fee from households, commercial enterprises and institutions. As the efficiency of fee collection from households is only around 50%, the total amount of revenues are not sufficient to cover the running costs. This results in a substantial yearly deficit. The results of the research therefore show that a more detailed cost structure and cost-revenue analysis of this waste management service is important with appropriate measures, either by the privates sector itself or with the support of the local authorities, in order to enhance cost efficiency and balance the cost-revenues towards cost recovery. Delays in mitigating the evident financial deficit could else endanger the public-private partnership (PPP) and lead to failure of this setup in the medium to long term, thus also endangering the now existing improved and currently reliable service. We present four options on how financial sustainability of the SWM system in Bahir Dar might be enhanced: (i) improved fee collection efficiency by linking the fees of solid waste collection to water supply; (ii) increasing the value chain by sales of organic waste recycling products; (iii) diversifying revenue streams and financing mechanisms (polluter-pays-, cross-subsidy- and business-principles); and (iv) cost reduction and improved cost-effectiveness. We argue that in a PPP setup such as in Bahir Dar, a strong alliance between the municipality and private enterprise is important so that appropriate solutions for improved financial sustainability of a SWM system can be sought and implemented.","","Available from http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.wasman.2013.10.014","","","","United States","2014-02-15T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: Waste Management; Journal Volume: 34; Journal Issue: 2; Other Information: Copyright (c) 2013 Elsevier Science B.V., Amsterdam, The Netherlands, All rights reserved.; Country of input: International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA)","","Medium: X; Size: page(s) 542-552","","","","Journal ID: ISSN 0956-053X; CODEN: WAMAE2; PII: S0956-053X(13)00500-X; TRN: US14R3434010797","10.1016/J.WASMAN.2013.10.014","","2015-01-30T00:00:00Z","22304625","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/22304625","","Waste Management","2","34"

"The Performance of Underground Radioactive Waste Storage Tanks at the Savannah River Site: A 60-Year Historical Perspective","Wiersma, Bruce J.","36 MATERIALS SCIENCE; 12 MANAGEMENT OF RADIOACTIVE AND NON-RADIOACTIVE WASTES FROM NUCLEAR FACILITIES; Savannah River Site (SRS); radioactive waste; Actinide Removal Process (ARP); Modular Caustic Side Solvent Extraction Unit (MCU)","The Savannah River Site produced weapons-grade materials for nearly 35 years between 1953 and 1988. The legacy of this production is nearly 37 million gallons of radioactive waste. Since the 1950s, the liquid waste has been stored in large, underground carbon steel waste tanks. During the past 20 years, the site has begun to process the waste so that it may be stored in vitrified and grout forms, which are more suitable for long-term storage. Over the history of the site, some tanks have experienced leakage of the waste to the secondary containment. This article is a review of the instances of leakage and corrosion degradation that the tanks and associated equipment have experienced since the first tanks were built. Furthermore, the activities that the site has taken to mitigate the degradation and manage the service life of the tank for its anticipated lifetime are reviewed.","Springer","","Savannah River Site (SRS), Aiken, SC (United States)","USDOE Office of Environmental Management (EM)","","United States","2014-02-08T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: Journal of The Minerals, Metals & Materials Society; Journal Volume: 66; Journal Issue: 3","","Medium: ED; Size: p. 471-490","","SRNL/STI-2013-00721","AC09-08SR22470","Journal ID: ISSN 1047-4838","10.1007/s11837-014-0870-x","","2015-10-29T00:00:00Z","1169579","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/1169579","https://www.osti.gov/servlets/purl/1169579","Journal of The Minerals, Metals & Materials Society","3","66"
"Model for the conversion of nuclear waste melter feed to glass","Pokorny, Richard; Hrma, Pavel R.; Pohang Univ. of Science and Technology, Pohang (Korea, Republic of). Division of Advanced Nuclear Engineering]","12 MANAGEMENT OF RADIOACTIVE AND NON-RADIOACTIVE WASTES FROM NUCLEAR FACILITIES","The rate of batch-to-glass conversion is a primary concern for the vitrification of nuclear waste, as it directly influences the life cycle of the cleanup process. This study describes the development of an advanced model of the cold cap, which augments the previous model by further developments on the structure and the dynamics of the foam layer. The foam layer on the bottom of the cold cap consists of the primary foam, cavities, and the secondary foam, and forms an interface through which the heat is transferred to the cold cap. Other model enhancements include the behavior of intermediate crystalline phases and the dissolution of quartz particles. The model relates the melting rate to feed properties and melter conditions, such as the molten glass temperature, foaminess of the feed, or the heat fraction supplied to the cold cap from the plenum space. The model correctly predicts a 25% increase in melting rate when changing the alumina source in the melter feed from Al(OH)3 to AlO(OH). It is expected that this model will be incorporated in the full glass melter model as its integral component.","Elsevier","","Pacific Northwest National Lab.

"Scientific Solutions to Nuclear Waste Environmental Challenges","Johnson, Bradley R.","12 MANAGEMENT OF RADIOACTIVE AND NON-RADIOACTIVE WASTES FROM NUCLEAR FACILITIES","The Hidden Cost of Nuclear Weapons The Cold War arms race drove an intense plutonium production program in the U.S. This campaign produced approximately 100 tons of plutonium over 40 years. The epicenter of plutonium production in the United States was the Hanford site, a 586 square mile reservation owned by the Department of Energy and located on the Colombia River in Southeastern Washington. Plutonium synthesis relied on nuclear reactors to convert uranium to plutonium within the reactor fuel rods. After a sufficient amount of conversion occurred, the rods were removed from the reactor and allowed to cool. They were then dissolved in an acid bath and chemically processed to separate and purify plutonium from the rest of the constituents in the used reactor fuel. The acidic waste was then neutralized using sodium hydroxide and the resulting mixture of liquids and precipitates (small insoluble particles) was stored in huge underground waste tanks. The byproducts of the U.S. plutonium production campaign include over 53 million gallons of high-level radioactive waste stored in 177 large underground tanks at Hanford and another 34 million gallons stored at the Savannah River Site in South Carolina. This legacy nuclear waste represents one of the largest environmental clean-up challenges facing the world today. The nuclear waste in the Hanford tanks is a mixture of liquids and precipitates that have settled into sludge. Some of these tanks are now over 60 years old and a small number of them are leaking radioactive waste into the ground and contaminating the environment. The solution to this nuclear waste challenge is to convert the mixture of solids and liquids into a durable material that won't disperse into the environment and create hazards to the biosphere. What makes this difficult is the fact that the radioactive half-lives of some of the radionuclides in the waste are thousands to millions of years long. (The half-life of a radioactive substance is the amount of time it takes for one-half of the material to undergo radioactive decay.) In general, the ideal material would need to be durable for approximately 10 half-lives to allow the activity to decay to negligible levels. However, the potential health effects of each radionuclide vary depending on what type of radiation is emitted, the energy of that emission, and the susceptibility for the human body to accumulate and concentrate that particular element. Consequently, actual standards tend to be based on limiting the dose (energy deposited per unit mass) that is introduced into the environment. The Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) has the responsibility to establish standards for nuclear waste disposal to protect the health and safety of the public. For example, the Energy Policy Act of 1992 directed the EPA to establish radiation protection standards for the Yucca Mountain geologic repository for nuclear wastes. The standards for Yucca Mountain were promulgated in 2008, and limit the dose to 15 millirem per year for the first 10,000 years, and 100 milirem per year between 10,000 years and 1 million years (40 CFR Part 197; http://www.epa.gov/radiation/yucca/2008factsheet.html). So, the challenge is two-fold: (1) develop a material (a waste form) that is capable of immobilizing the waste over geologic time scales, and (2) develop a process to convert the radioactive sludge in the tanks into this durable waste form material. Glass: Hard, durable, inert, and with infinite chemical versatility Molten glass is a powerful solvent liquid, which can be designed to dissolve almost anything. When solidified, it can be one of the most chemically inert substances known to man. Nature's most famous analogue to glass is obsidian, a vitreous product of volcanic activity; formations over 17 million years old have been found. Archaeologists have found man-made glass specimens that are five thousand years old.","Seattle, WA","See the magazine website at http://www.agcmagazine.com/volumes.html","Pacific Northwest National Lab.

One of the ways of treating/disposing MSW is energy recovery, as waste is considered to contain a considerable amount of bio-waste and therefore can lead to renewable energy production. The overall efficiency can be very high in the cases of co-generation or tri-generation. In this paper a model is presented, aiming to support decision makers in issues relating to Municipal Solid Waste energy recovery. The idea of using more fuel sources, including MSW and agricultural residue biomass that may exist in a rural area, is explored. The model aims at optimizing the system specifications, such as the capacity of the base-load Waste-to-Energy facility, the capacity of the peak-load biomass boiler and the location of the facility. Furthermore, it defines the quantity of each potential fuel source that should be used annually, in order to maximize the financial yield of the investment. The results of an energy tri-generation case study application at a rural area of Greece, using mixed MSW and biomass, indicate positive financial yield of investment. In addition, a sensitivity analysis is performed on the effect of the most important parameters of the model on the optimum solution, pinpointing the parameters of interest rate, investment cost and heating oil price, as those requiring the attention of the decision makers. Finally, the sensitivity analysis is enhanced by a stochastic analysis to determine the effect of the volatility of parameters on the robustness of the model and the solution obtained.","","Available from http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.wasman.2013.09.026","","","","United States","2014-01-15T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: Waste Management; Journal Volume: 34; Journal Issue: 1; Other Information: Copyright (c) 2013 Elsevier Science B.V., Amsterdam, The Netherlands, All rights reserved.; Country of input: International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA)","","Medium: X; Size: page(s) 36-48","","","","Journal ID: ISSN 0956-053X; CODEN: WAMAE2; PII: S0956-053X(13)00463-7; TRN: US14R3410010773","10.1016/J.WASMAN.2013.09.026","","2015-01-30T00:00:00Z","22304601","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/22304601","","Waste Management","1","34"

Arguments such as health, depletion of resources, cost, noise, odours, traffic movement and house prices are often cited as reasons against the development of such facilities. This study aims to review the arguments and identify any effect on property prices due to the public perception of the plant. A selection of existing energy from waste (EfW) facilities in the UK, operational for at least 7 years, was selected and property sales data, within 5 km of the sites, was acquired and analysed in detail. The locations of the properties were calculated in relation to the plant using GIS software (ArcGIS) and the distances split into 5 zones ranging from 0 to 5 km from the site. The local property sale prices, normalised against the local house price index, were compared in two time periods, before and after the facility became operational, across each of the 5 zones. In all cases analysed no significant negative effect was observed on property prices at any distance within 5 km from a modern operational incinerator. This indicated that the perceived negative effect of the thermal processing of waste on local property values is negligible.","","Available from http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.wasman.2013.08.018","","","","United States","2014-01-15T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: Waste Management; Journal Volume: 34; Journal Issue: 1; Other Information: Copyright (c) 2013 Elsevier Science B.V., Amsterdam, The Netherlands, All rights reserved.; Country of input: International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA)","","Medium: X; Size: page(s) 219-225","","","","Journal ID: ISSN 0956-053X; CODEN: WAMAE2; PII: S0956-053X(13)00391-7; TRN: US14R3416010779","10.1016/J.WASMAN.2013.08.018","","2015-01-30T00:00:00Z","22304607","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/22304607","","Waste Management","1","34"
"Relationship between Anisotropy in Soil Hydraulic Conductivity and Saturation","Zhang, Z. Fred","12 MANAGEMENT OF RADIOACTIVE AND NON-RADIOACTIVE WASTES FROM NUCLEAR FACILITIES; Vadose Zone; Soil Physics; Flow","Anisotropy in unsaturated hydraulic conductivity is saturation-dependent. Accurate characterization of soil anisotropy is very important in simulating flow and contaminant (e.g., radioactive nuclides in Hanford) transport. A recently developed tensorial connectivity-tortuosity (TCT) concept describes the hydraulic conductivity tensor of the unsaturated anisotropic soils as the product of a scalar variable, the symmetric connectivity tortuosity tensor, and the hydraulic conductivity tensor at saturation. In this study, the TCT model is used to quantify soil anisotropy in unsaturated hydraulic conductivity. The TCT model can describe different types of soil anisotropy; e.g., the anisotropy coefficient, C, can be monotonically increase or decrease with saturation and can vary from greater than unity to less than unity and vice versa. Soil anisotropy is independent of soil water retention properties and can be characterized by the ratio of the saturated hydraulic conductivities and the difference of the tortuosity-connectivity coefficients in two directions. ln(C) is linearly proportional to ln(Se) with Se being the effective saturation. The log-linear relationship between C and Se allows the saturation-dependent anisotropy to be determined using linear regression with the measurements of the directional hydraulic conductivities at a minimum of two water content levels, of which one may be at full saturation. The model was tested using measurements of directional hydraulic conductivities.","Soil Science Society of America","","Pacific Northwest National Lab.

Processing a large sample of MSDF in an existing full-scale mechanical sorting facility equipped with near infrared and 2-3 dimensional selectors led to the extraction of about 6% w/w of recyclables with respect to the RMSW weight. Maximum selection efficiency was achieved for metals, about 98% w/w, whereas it was lower for Waste Electrical and Electronic Equipment (WEEE), about 2% w/w. After a simulated lab scale soil washing treatment it was possible to extract about 2% w/w of inert exploitable substances recoverable as construction materials, with respect to the amount of RMSW. The passing curve showed that inert materials were mainly sand with a particle size ranging from 0.063 to 2 mm. Leaching tests showed quite low heavy metal concentrations with the exception of the particles retained by the 0.5 mm sieve.

This paper characterises and analyses the operations of socio-economic enterprises that are involved in the reuse of Information and Communication Technology (ICT) equipment. Using findings from a survey, the paper specifically analyses the reuse activities of socio-economic enterprises in the UK from which Europe-wide conclusions are drawn. The amount of ICT products handled by the reuse organisations is quantified and potential barriers and opportunities to their operations are analysed. By-products from reuse activities are discussed and recommendations to improve reuse activities are provided. The most common ICT products dealt with by socio-economic enterprises are computers and related equipment. In the UK in 2010, an estimated 143,750 appliances were reused. However, due to limitations in data, it is difficult to compare this number to the amount of new appliances that entered the UK market or the amount of waste electrical and electronic equipment generated in the same period. Difficulties in marketing products and numerous legislative requirements are the most common barriers to reuse operations. Despite various constraints, it is clear that organisations involved in reuse of ICT could contribute significantly to resource efficiency and a circular economy. It is suggested that clustering of their operations into “reuse parks” would enhance both their profile and their products. Reuse parks would also improve consumer confidence in and subsequently sales of the products. Further, it is advocated that industrial networking opportunities for the exchange of by-products resulting from the organisations’ activities should be investigated. The findings make two significant contributions to the current literature. One, they provide a detailed insight into the reuse operations of socio-economic enterprises. Previously unavailable data has been presented and analysed. Secondly, new evidence about the by-products/materials resulting from socio-economic enterprises’ reuse activities has been obtained. These contributions add substantially to our understanding of the important role of reuse organisations.","","Available from http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.wasman.2013.08.020","","","","United States","2013-12-15T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: Waste Management; Journal Volume: 33; Journal Issue: 12; Other Information: Copyright (c) 2013 Elsevier Science B.V., Amsterdam, The Netherlands, All rights reserved.; Country of input: International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA)","","Medium: X; Size: page(s) 2600-2606","","","","Journal ID: ISSN 0956-053X; CODEN: WAMAE2; PII: S0956-053X(13)00393-0; TRN: US14R3337006508","10.1016/J.WASMAN.2013.08.020","","2015-01-27T00:00:00Z","22300335","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/22300335","","Waste Management","12","33"

Several options associated to the supply chain for implementing a MSW management system are available, however to determine the optimal solution several technical, economic, environmental and social aspects must be considered. Therefore, this paper proposes a mathematical programming model for the optimal planning of the supply chain associated to the MSW management system to maximize the economic benefit while accounting for technical and environmental issues. The optimization model simultaneously selects the processing technologies and their location, the distribution of wastes from cities as well as the distribution of products to markets. The problem was formulated as a multi-objective mixed-integer linear programing problem to maximize the profit of the supply chain and the amount of recycled wastes, where the results are showed through Pareto curves that tradeoff economic and environmental aspects. The proposed approach is applied to a case study for the west-central part of Mexico to consider the integration of MSW from several cities to yield useful products. The results show that an integrated utilization of MSW can provide economic, environmental and social benefits.","","Available from http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.wasman.2013.08.010","","","","United States","2013-12-15T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: Waste Management; Journal Volume: 33; Journal Issue: 12; Other Information: Copyright (c) 2013 Elsevier Science B.V., Amsterdam, The Netherlands, All rights reserved.; Country of input: International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA)","","Medium: X; Size: page(s) 2607-2622","","","","Journal ID: ISSN 0956-053X; CODEN: WAMAE2; PII: S0956-053X(13)00383-8; TRN: US14R3338006509","10.1016/J.WASMAN.2013.08.010","","2015-01-27T00:00:00Z","22300336","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/22300336","","Waste Management","12","33"
"Nitrogen availability and indirect measurements of greenhouse gas emissions from aerobic and anaerobic biowaste digestates applied to agricultural soils","Rigby, H.; Smith, S.R., E-mail: s.r.smith@imperial.ac.uk","54 ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCES; 12 MANAGEMENT OF RADIOACTIVE WASTES, AND NON-RADIOACTIVE WASTES FROM NUCLEAR FACILITIES; AMMONIUM CHLORIDES; BIOMASS; CAPACITY; CLAYS; DENITRIFICATION; GREENHOUSE GASES; LOAM; MATERIALS RECOVERY; NITRATES; NITROGEN; NUTRIENTS; ORGANIC MATTER; ORGANIC WASTES; PHYSICAL PROPERTIES; RECYCLING; SANITARY LANDFILLS; SEWAGE SLUDGE; SOLID WASTES","Highlights: • Nitrogen release in digestate-amended soil depends on the digestate type. • Overall N release is modulated by digestate mineral and mineralisable N contents. • Microbial immobilisation does not influence overall release of digestate N in soil. • Digestate physical properties and soil type interact to affect overall N recovery. • High labile C inputs in digestate may promote denitrification in fine-textured soil. - Abstract: Recycling biowaste digestates on agricultural land diverts biodegradable waste from landfill disposal and represents a sustainable source of nutrients and organic matter (OM) to improve soil for crop production. However, the dynamics of nitrogen (N) release from these organic N sources must be determined to optimise their fertiliser value and management. This laboratory incubation experiment examined the effects of digestate type (aerobic and anaerobic), waste type (industrial, agricultural and municipal solid waste or sewage sludge) and soil type (sandy loam, sandy silt loam and silty clay) on N availability in digestate-amended soils and also quantified the extent and significance of the immobilisation of N within the soil microbial biomass, as a possible regulatory mechanism of N release. The digestate types examined included: dewatered, anaerobically digested biosolids (DMAD); dewatered, anaerobic mesophilic digestate from the organic fraction of municipal solid waste (DMADMSW); liquid, anaerobic co-digestate of food and animal slurry (LcoMAD) and liquid, thermophilic aerobic digestate of food waste (LTAD). Ammonium chloride (NH{sub 4}Cl) was included as a reference treatment for mineral N. After 48 days, the final, maximum net recoveries of mineral N relative to the total N (TN) addition in the different digestates and unamended control treatments were in the decreasing order: LcoMAD, 68%; LTAD, 37%, DMAD, 20%; and DMADMSW, 11%. A transient increase in microbial biomass N (MBN) was observed with LTAD application, indicating greater microbial activity in amended soil and reflecting the lower stability of this OM source, compared to the other, anaerobic digestate types, which showed no consistent effects on MBN compared to the control. Thus, the overall net release of digestate N in different soil types was not regulated by N transfer into the soil microbial biomass, but was determined primarily by digestate properties and the capacity of the soil type to process and turnover digestate N. In contrast to the sandy soil types, where nitrate (NO{sub 3}{sup -}) concentrations increased during incubation, there was an absence of NO{sub 3}{sup -} accumulation in the silty clay soil amended with LTAD and DMADMSW. This provided indirect evidence for denitrification activity and the gaseous loss of N, and the associated increased risk of greenhouse gas emissions under certain conditions of labile C supply and/or digestate physical structure in fine-textured soil types. The significance and influence of the interaction between soil type and digestate stability and physical properties on denitrification processes in digestate-amended soils require urgent investigation to ensure management practices are appropriate to minimise greenhouse gas emissions from land applied biowastes.","","Available from http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.wasman.2013.08.005","","","","United States","2013-12-15T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: Waste Management; Journal Volume: 33; Journal Issue: 12; Other Information: Copyright (c) 2013 Elsevier Science B.V., Amsterdam, The Netherlands, All rights reserved.; Country of input: International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA)","","Medium: X; Size: page(s) 2641-2652","","","","Journal ID: ISSN 0956-053X; CODEN: WAMAE2; PII: S0956-053X(13)00378-4; TRN: US14R3339006510","10.1016/J.WASMAN.2013.08.005","","2015-01-27T00:00:00Z","22300337","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/22300337","","Waste Management","12","33"

The composition and heating value information is generally available, but the renewable energy share or heating values of different fractions of waste have rarely been determined. In this study, data from Finnish studies concerning the composition and energy content of mixed MSW were collected, new experimental data on the compositions, heating values and renewable share of energy were presented and the results were compared to the estimations concluded from earlier international studies. In the town of Lappeenranta in south-eastern Finland, the share of renewable energy ranged between 25% and 34% in the energy content tests implemented for two sample trucks. The heating values of the waste and fractions of plastic waste were high in the samples compared to the earlier studies in Finland. These high values were caused by good source separation and led to a low share of renewable energy content in the waste. The results showed that in mixed municipal solid waste the renewable share of the energy content can be significantly lower than the general assumptions (50–60%) when the source separation of organic waste, paper and cardboard is carried out successfully. The number of samples was however small for making extensive conclusions on the results concerning the heating values and renewable share of energy and additional research is needed for this purpose.","","Available from http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.wasman.2013.08.017","","","","United States","2013-12-15T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: Waste Management; Journal Volume: 33; Journal Issue: 12; Other Information: Copyright (c) 2013 Elsevier Science B.V., Amsterdam, The Netherlands, All rights reserved.; Country of input: International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA)","","Medium: X; Size: page(s) 2680-2686","","","","Journal ID: ISSN 0956-053X; CODEN: WAMAE2; PII: S0956-053X(13)00390-5; TRN: US14R3341006512","10.1016/J.WASMAN.2013.08.017","","2015-01-27T00:00:00Z","22300339","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/22300339","","Waste Management","12","33"

According to European and Swiss legislation, toxic components like batteries, capacitors and printed wiring boards have to be removed from WEEE. The control bodies of the Swiss take back schemes have been monitoring the activities of WEEE recyclers in Switzerland for about 15 years. All recyclers have to provide annual mass balance data for every year of operation. From this data, percentage shares of removed batteries and capacitors are calculated in relation to the amount of each respective WEEE category treated. A rationale is developed, why such an indicator should not be calculated for printed wiring boards. The distributions of these de-pollution indicators are analysed and their suitability for defining lower threshold values and benchmarks for the depollution of WEEE is discussed. Recommendations for benchmarks and threshold values for the removal of capacitors and batteries are given.","","Available from http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.wasman.2013.08.014","","","","United States","2013-12-15T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: Waste Management; Journal Volume: 33; Journal Issue: 12; Other Information: Copyright (c) 2013 Elsevier Science B.V., Amsterdam, The Netherlands, All rights reserved.; Country of input: International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA)","","Medium: X; Size: page(s) 2737-2743","","","","Journal ID: ISSN 0956-053X; CODEN: WAMAE2; PII: S0956-053X(13)00387-5; TRN: US14R3343006514","10.1016/J.WASMAN.2013.08.014","","2015-01-27T00:00:00Z","22300341","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/22300341","","Waste Management","12","33"

Assessment of HCW disposal alternatives can be regarded as a complicated multi-criteria decision making (MCDM) problem which requires consideration of multiple alternative solutions and conflicting tangible and intangible criteria. The objective of this paper is to present a new MCDM technique based on fuzzy set theory and VIKOR method for evaluating HCW disposal methods. Linguistic variables are used by decision makers to assess the ratings and weights for the established criteria. The ordered weighted averaging (OWA) operator is utilized to aggregate individual opinions of decision makers into a group assessment. The computational procedure of the proposed framework is illustrated through a case study in Shanghai, one of the largest cities of China. The HCW treatment alternatives considered in this study include “incineration”, “steam sterilization”, “microwave” and “landfill”.

Greenhouse gas emissions can be reduced through recovery and recycling of resources from the municipal solid waste stream. In São Paulo, Brazil, recycling cooperatives play a crucial role in providing recycling services including collection, separation, cleaning, stocking, and sale of recyclable resources. The present research attempts to measure the greenhouse gas emission reductions achieved by the recycling cooperative Cooperpires, as well as highlight its socioeconomic benefits. Methods include participant observation, structured interviews, questionnaire application, and greenhouse gas accounting of recycling using a Clean Development Mechanism methodology. The results show that recycling cooperatives can achieve important energy savings and reductions in greenhouse gas emissions, and suggest there is an opportunity for Cooperpires and other similar recycling groups to participate in the carbon credit market. Based on these findings, the authors created a simple greenhouse gas accounting calculator for recyclers to estimate their emissions reductions.","","Available from http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.wasman.2013.07.031","","","","United States","2013-12-15T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: Waste Management; Journal Volume: 33; Journal Issue: 12; Other Information: Copyright (c) 2013 Elsevier Science B.V., Amsterdam, The Netherlands, All rights reserved.; Country of input: International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA)","","Medium: X; Size: page(s) 2771-2780","","","","Journal ID: ISSN 0956-053X; CODEN: WAMAE2; PII: S0956-053X(13)00375-9; TRN: US14R3345006516","10.1016/J.WASMAN.2013.07.031","","2015-01-27T00:00:00Z","22300343","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/22300343","","Waste Management","12","33"

This study compares the environmental performances of 110 French incinerators (i.e. 85% of the total number of plants currently in activity in France) in a Life Cycle Assessment perspective, considering 5 non-toxic impact categories: climate change, photochemical oxidant formation, particulate matter formation, terrestrial acidification and marine eutrophication. Mean, median and lower/upper impact potentials are determined considering the incineration of 1 tonne of French residual Municipal Solid Waste. The results highlight the relatively large variability of the impact potentials as a function of the plant technical performances. In particular, the climate change impact potential of the incineration of 1 tonne of waste ranges from a benefit of −58 kg CO{sub 2}-eq to a relatively large burden of 408 kg CO{sub 2}-eq, with 294 kg CO{sub 2}-eq as the average impact. Two main plant-specific parameters drive the impact potentials regarding the 5 non-toxic impact categories under study: the energy recovery and delivery rate and the NO{sub x} process-specific emissions. The variability of the impact potentials as a function of incinerator characteristics therefore calls for the use of site-specific data when required by the LCA goal and scope definition phase, in particular when the study focuses on a specific incinerator or on a local waste management plan, and when these data are available.","","Available from http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.wasman.2013.07.003","","","","United States","2013-12-15T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: Waste Management; Journal Volume: 33; Journal Issue: 12; Other Information: Copyright (c) 2013 Elsevier Science B.V., Amsterdam, The Netherlands, All rights reserved.; Country of input: International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA)","","Medium: X; Size: page(s) 2781-2788","","","","Journal ID: ISSN 0956-053X; CODEN: WAMAE2; PII: S0956-053X(13)00305-X; TRN: US14R3346006517","10.1016/J.WASMAN.2013.07.003","","2015-01-27T00:00:00Z","22300344","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/22300344","","Waste Management","12","33"

The purpose of this paper is to show how LCA methodology can be simplified to be more useful for certain applications. In order to improve waste management in Catalonia (Spain), a Cumulative Energy Demand indicator (LCA-based) has been used to obtain four mathematical models to help the government in the decision of preventing or allowing a specific waste from going out of the borders. The conceptual equations and all the subsequent developments and assumptions made to obtain the simplified models are presented. One of the four models is discussed in detail, presenting the final simplified equation to be subsequently used by the government in decision making. The resulting model has been found to be scientifically robust, simple to implement and, above all, fulfilling its purpose: the limitation of waste transport out of Catalonia unless the waste recovery operations are significantly better and justify this transport.","","Available from http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.wasman.2013.08.004","","","","United States","2013-12-15T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: Waste Management; Journal Volume: 33; Journal Issue: 12; Other Information: Copyright (c) 2013 Elsevier Science B.V., Amsterdam, The Netherlands, All rights reserved.; Country of input: International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA)","","Medium: X; Size: page(s) 2789-2797","","","","Journal ID: ISSN 0956-053X; CODEN: WAMAE2; PII: S0956-053X(13)00376-0; TRN: US14R3347006518","10.1016/J.WASMAN.2013.08.004","","2015-01-27T00:00:00Z","22300345","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/22300345","","Waste Management","12","33"

This paper reports on the current views and knowledge of young people (university students) in this region about waste management operations and facilities, specifically the siting of landfills and incinerators. By means of a structured questionnaire, opinion and knowledge were systematically examined by degree type and course year. The study took place in 2011 at the University of Salerno campus. A sample of 900 students, comprising 100 students for each of the nine considered faculties, and 20 students for every academic course year, was randomly selected. Only about a quarter of respondents were not opposed to the siting of a landfill or an incinerator in their city. This clearly highlights that historic opposition to the construction of waste facilities is difficult to overcome and that distrust for previous poor management or indiscretions is long-lived and transcends generations. Students from technical faculties expressed the most reasonable opinion; opinion and knowledge were statistically related (Chi-square test, p < 0.05) to the attended faculty, and the knowledge grew linearly with progression through the university. This suggests that awareness of waste management practices develops with experience and understanding of environmental issues. There is general acceptance that many stakeholders – technicians, politicians and citizens – all have to be part of the decision process when siting a new waste management facility. The opinions of the young respondents were significantly influenced by their level of environmental knowledge.","","Available from http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.wasman.2013.08.019","","","","United States","2013-12-15T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: Waste Management; Journal Volume: 33; Journal Issue: 12; Other Information: Copyright (c) 2013 Elsevier Science B.V., Amsterdam, The Netherlands, All rights reserved.; Country of input: International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA)","","Medium: X; Size: page(s) 2798-2810","","","","Journal ID: ISSN 0956-053X; CODEN: WAMAE2; PII: S0956-053X(13)00392-9; TRN: US14R3348006519","10.1016/J.WASMAN.2013.08.019","","2015-01-27T00:00:00Z","22300346","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/22300346","","Waste Management","12","33"

While the facility is designed to handle radioactive materials, the location of the <sup>65</sup>Zn was in an area that is not designed for gamma emitting contaminants. A series of experiments were conducted to entrain the contaminant in an easily replaceable trap within the process piping. The experiments were conducted with increasing levels of complexity. Initially a simple apparatus was developed to determine the effect of substrate temperature on the vapor capture, this was followed by experiments to determine the effect of filter pore size on pumping and trapping, finally the interactive effects of both pore size and temperature were evaluated. The testing was conducted on a system that used a roughing vacuum pump using model and prototypic materials. It was determined that heating the substrate to nominally 200°C resulted in effective trapping on the model as well as prototypic material.","","available","Savannah River Site (SRS), Aiken, SC (United States)","USDOE","","United States","2013-12-10T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: Journal of Failure Analysis and Prevention; Journal Volume: 14; Journal Issue: 1","","Medium: ED; Size: p. 113-121","","SRNL-STI-2013-00667","AC09-08SR22470","Journal ID: ISSN 1547-7029","10.1007/s11668-013-9774-2","","2016-11-07T00:00:00Z","1116989","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/1116989","https://www.osti.gov/servlets/purl/1116989","Journal of Failure Analysis and Prevention","1","14"

Instead it is the response to a host of coupled material and environmental processes whose rates are estimated by a combination of theory, experiment, and modeling. High-level nuclear waste (HLW) glass is perhaps the most studied of any material yet there remain significant technical gaps regarding their chemical durability. The phenomena affecting the long-term performance of HLW glasses in their disposal environment include surface reactions, transport properties to and from the reacting glass surface, and ion exchange between the solid glass and the surrounding solution and alteration products. The rates of these processes are strongly influenced and are coupled through the solution chemistry, which is in turn influenced by the reacting glass and also by reaction with the near-field materials and precipitation of alteration products. Therefore, those processes must be understood sufficiently well to estimate or bound the performance of HLW glass in its disposal environment over geologic time-scales. This article summarizes the current state of understanding of surface reactions, transport properties, and ion exchange along with the near-field materials and alteration products influences on solution chemistry and glass reaction rates.

This study evaluated the performance of a completely stirred anaerobic reactor treating pig manure at different temperatures (20, 28 and 38 °C). The start-up phase of the reactor at 20 °C was very long and extremely poor performance was observed with increasing organic loading rate (OLR). At an OLR of 4.3 g ODM L{sup −1} d{sup −1}, methane production at 28 °C was comparable (3% less) with that at 38 °C, but the risk of acidification was high at 28 °C. At low OLR (1.3 g ODM L{sup −1} d{sup −1}), the biogas process appeared stable at 28 °C and gave same methane yields as compared to the reactor operating at 38 °C.

"Recovery of yttrium from cathode ray tubes and lamps’ fluorescent powders: experimental results and economic simulation","Innocenzi, V., E-mail: valentina.innocenzi1@univaq.it; De Michelis, I.; Ferella, F.; Vegliò, F.","12 MANAGEMENT OF RADIOACTIVE WASTES, AND NON-RADIOACTIVE WASTES FROM NUCLEAR FACILITIES; 36 MATERIALS SCIENCE; CALCINATION; COPRECIPITATION; FLUORESCENT LAMPS; LEACHING; MATERIALS RECOVERY; OXALIC ACID; SIMULATION; SODIUM HYDROXIDES; SODIUM SULFIDES; SOLUTIONS; YTTRIUM OXIDES","Highlights: • Fluorescent powder of lamps. • Fluorescent powder of cathode ray rubes. • Recovery of yttrium from fluorescent powders. • Economic simulation for the processes to recover yttrium from WEEE. - Abstract: In this paper, yttrium recovery from fluorescent powder of lamps and cathode ray tubes (CRTs) is described. The process for treating these materials includes the following: (a) acid leaching, (b) purification of the leach liquors using sodium hydroxide and sodium sulfide, (c) precipitation of yttrium using oxalic acid, and (d) calcinations of oxalates for production of yttrium oxides. Experimental results have shown that process conditions necessary to purify the solutions and recover yttrium strongly depend on composition of the leach liquor, in other words, whether the powder comes from treatment of CRTs or lamp. In the optimal experimental conditions, the recoveries of yttrium oxide are about 95%, 55%, and 65% for CRT, lamps, and CRT/lamp mixture (called MIX) powders, respectively. The lower yields obtained during treatments of MIX and lamp powders are probably due to the co-precipitation of yttrium together with other metals contained in the lamps powder only. Yttrium loss can be reduced to minimum changing the experimental conditions with respect to the case of the CRT process. In any case, the purity of final products from CRT, lamps, and MIX is greater than 95%. Moreover, the possibility to treat simultaneously both CRT and lamp powders is very important and interesting from an industrial point of view since it could be possible to run a single plant treating fluorescent powder coming from two different electronic wastes.","","Available from http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.wasman.2013.06.002","","","","United States","2013-11-15T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: Waste Management; Journal Volume: 33; Journal Issue: 11; Other Information: Copyright (c) 2013 Elsevier Science B.V., Amsterdam, The Netherlands, All rights reserved.; Country of input: International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA)","","Medium: X; Size: page(s) 2390-2396","","","","Journal ID: ISSN 0956-053X; CODEN: WAMAE2; PII: S0956-053X(13)00259-6; TRN: US14R3323010750","10.1016/J.WASMAN.2013.06.002","","2015-01-30T00:00:00Z","22304578","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/22304578","","Waste Management","11","33"

Close correspondence was found between the measured NMR signal intensities and those predicted by the model for all RO wastes except for poultry manure char. Molecular nature of the organic matter differed widely between the RO wastes. As a proportion of organic C, carbohydrate C ranged from 0.07 to 0.63, protein C from <0.01 to 0.66, lignin C from <0.01 to 0.31, aliphatic C from 0.09 to 0.73, carbonyl C from 0.02 to 0.23, and char C from 0 to 0.45.

However, there is considerable uncertainty concerning the residual pollution potential of such wastes. This paper presents the results of laboratory experiments on two different MBT waste residues, carried out to investigate the remaining potential for the generation of greenhouse gases and the flushing of contaminants from these materials when landfilled. The potential for gas generation was found to be between 8% and 20% of that for raw MSW. Pretreatment of the waste reduced the potential for the release of organic carbon, ammoniacal nitrogen, and heavy metal contents into the leachate; and reduced the residual carbon remaining in the waste after final degradation from ∼320 g/kg dry matter for raw MSW to between 183 and 195 g/kg dry matter for the MBT wastes.","","Available from http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.wasman.2013.07.024","","","","United States","2013-11-15T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: Waste Management; Journal Volume: 33; Journal Issue: 11; Other Information: Copyright (c) 2013 Elsevier Science B.V., Amsterdam, The Netherlands, All rights reserved.; Country of input: International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA)","","Medium: X; Size: page(s) 2257-2266","","","","Journal ID: ISSN 0956-053X; CODEN: WAMAE2; PII: S0956-053X(13)00352-8; TRN: US14R3316006488","10.1016/J.WASMAN.2013.07.024","","2015-01-27T00:00:00Z","22300315","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/22300315","","Waste Management","11","33"

The decomposition of these products under anaerobic landfill conditions results in the generation of biogenic carbon dioxide and methane, while the un-decomposed portion represents a biogenic carbon sink. Information on the decomposition of these municipal waste components is used to estimate national methane emissions inventories, for attribution of carbon storage credits, and to assess the life-cycle greenhouse gas impacts of wood and paper products. Hardwood (HW), softwood (SW), plywood (PW), oriented strand board (OSB), particleboard (PB), medium-density fiberboard (MDF), newsprint (NP), corrugated container (CC) and copy paper (CP) were buried in landfills operated with leachate recirculation, and were excavated after approximately 1.5 and 2.5 yr. Samples were analyzed for cellulose (C), hemicellulose (H), lignin (L), volatile solids (VS), and organic carbon (OC). A holocellulose decomposition index (HOD) and carbon storage factor (CSF) were calculated to evaluate the extent of solids decomposition and carbon storage. Samples of OSB made from HW exhibited cellulose plus hemicellulose (C + H) loss of up to 38%, while loss for the other wood types was 0–10% in most samples. The C + H loss was up to 81%, 95% and 96% for NP, CP and CC, respectively. The CSFs for wood and paper samples ranged from 0.34 to 0.47 and 0.02 to 0.27 g OC g{sup −1} dry material, respectively. These results, in general, correlated well with an earlier laboratory-scale study, though NP and CC decomposition measured in this study were higher than previously reported.","","Available from http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.wasman.2013.07.009","","","","United States","2013-11-15T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: Waste Management; Journal Volume: 33; Journal Issue: 11; Other Information: Copyright (c) 2013 Elsevier Science B.V., Amsterdam, The Netherlands, All rights reserved.; Country of input: International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA)","","Medium: X; Size: page(s) 2267-2276","","","","Journal ID: ISSN 0956-053X; CODEN: WAMAE2; PII: S0956-053X(13)00337-1; TRN: US14R3317006489","10.1016/J.WASMAN.2013.07.009","","2015-01-27T00:00:00Z","22300316","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/22300316","","Waste Management","11","33"

Therefore fly ash must be treated as a hazardous material. On the other hand, it may be a potential source of heavy metals. Zinc, lead, cadmium, and copper can be relatively easily removed during the thermal treatment of fly ash, e.g. in the form of chlorides. In return, wet extraction methods could provide promising results for these elements including chromium and nickel. The aim of this study was to investigate and compare thermal and hydrometallurgical treatment of municipal solid waste fly ash. Thermal treatment of fly ash was performed in a rotary reactor at temperatures between 950 and 1050 °C and in a muffle oven at temperatures from 500 to 1200 °C. The removal more than 90% was reached by easy volatile heavy metals such as cadmium and lead and also by copper, however at higher temperature in the muffle oven. The alkaline (sodium hydroxide) and acid (sulphuric acid) leaching of the fly ash was carried out while the influence of temperature, time, concentration, and liquid/solid ratio were investigated. The combination of alkaline-acidic leaching enhanced the removal of, namely, zinc, chromium and nickel.","","Available from http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.wasman.2013.05.022","","","","United States","2013-11-15T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: Waste Management; Journal Volume: 33; Journal Issue: 11; Other Information: Copyright (c) 2013 Elsevier Science B.V., Amsterdam, The Netherlands, All rights reserved.; Country of input: International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA)","","Medium: X; Size: page(s) 2322-2327","","","","Journal ID: ISSN 0956-053X; CODEN: WAMAE2; PII: S0956-053X(13)00252-3; TRN: US14R3319006491","10.1016/J.WASMAN.2013.05.022","","2015-01-27T00:00:00Z","22300318","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/22300318","","Waste Management","11","33"

This corresponds to a Danish household discarding 29 g of WEEE (7 items per year), 4 g of batteries (9 batteries per year), 1 g of toners and 7 g of unidentifiable cables on average per week, constituting 0.34% (w/w), 0.04% (w/w), 0.01% (w/w) and 0.09% (w/w), respectively, of residual waste. The study also found that misplaced WEEE and batteries in the residual waste constituted 16% and 39%, respectively, of what is being collected properly through the dedicated special waste collection schemes. This shows that a large amount of batteries are being discarded with the residual waste, whereas WEEE seems to be collected relatively successfully through the dedicated special waste collection schemes. Characterisation of the misplaced batteries showed that 20% (w/w) of the discarded batteries were discarded as part of WEEE (built-in). Primarily alkaline batteries, carbon zinc batteries and alkaline button cell batteries were found to be discarded with the residual household waste. Characterisation of WEEE showed that primarily small WEEE (WEEE directive categories 2, 5a, 6, 7 and 9) and light sources (WEEE directive category 5b) were misplaced. Electric tooth brushes, watches, clocks, headphones, flashlights, bicycle lights, and cables were items most frequently found. It is recommended that these findings are taken into account when designing new or improving existing special waste collection schemes. Improving the collection of WEEE is also recommended as one way to also improve the collection of batteries due to the large fraction of batteries found as built-in. The findings in this study were comparable to other western European studies, suggesting that the recommendations made in this study could apply to other western European countries as well.","","Available from http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.wasman.2013.05.019","","","","United States","2013-11-15T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: Waste Management; Journal Volume: 33; Journal Issue: 11; Other Information: Copyright (c) 2013 Elsevier Science B.V., Amsterdam, The Netherlands, All rights reserved.; Country of input: International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA)","","Medium: X; Size: page(s) 2372-2380","","","","Journal ID: ISSN 0956-053X; CODEN: WAMAE2; PII: S0956-053X(13)00249-3; TRN: US14R3321006493","10.1016/J.WASMAN.2013.05.019","","2015-01-27T00:00:00Z","22300320","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/22300320","","Waste Management","11","33"

Accurate estimation of e-waste generation is difficult, mainly due to lack of high quality data referred to market and socio-economic dynamics. This paper addresses how to enhance e-waste estimates by providing techniques to increase data quality. An advanced, flexible and multivariate Input–Output Analysis (IOA) method is proposed. It links all three pillars in IOA (product sales, stock and lifespan profiles) to construct mathematical relationships between various data points. By applying this method, the data consolidation steps can generate more accurate time-series datasets from available data pool. This can consequently increase the reliability of e-waste estimates compared to the approach without data processing. A case study in the Netherlands is used to apply the advanced IOA model. As a result, for the first time ever, complete datasets of all three variables for estimating all types of e-waste have been obtained. The result of this study also demonstrates significant disparity between various estimation models, arising from the use of data under different conditions. It shows the importance of applying multivariate approach and multiple sources to improve data quality for modelling, specifically using appropriate time-varying lifespan parameters. Following the case study, a roadmap with a procedural guideline is provided to enhance e-waste estimation studies.","","Available from http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.wasman.2013.07.005","","","","United States","2013-11-15T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: Waste Management; Journal Volume: 33; Journal Issue: 11; Other Information: Copyright (c) 2013 Elsevier Science B.V., Amsterdam, The Netherlands, All rights reserved.; Country of input: International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA)","","Medium: X; Size: page(s) 2397-2407","","","","Journal ID: ISSN 0956-053X; CODEN: WAMAE2; PII: S0956-053X(13)00307-3; TRN: US14R3324006495","10.1016/J.WASMAN.2013.07.005","","2015-01-27T00:00:00Z","22300322","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/22300322","","Waste Management","11","33"

The effects of leachate recirculation at a low and high flow rate are examined with and without connection to an upflow anaerobic sludge blanket (UASB). Two dilution rates of the effective volume of the leach bed reactors were investigated: 1 and 6 dilutions per LBR per day. The increase in dilution rate from 1 to 6 improved the destruction of volatile solids without connection to the UASB. However connection to the UASB greatly improved the destruction of volatile solids (by almost 60%) at the low recirculation rate of 1 dilution per day. The increase in volatile solids destruction with connection to the UASB was attributed to an increase in leachate pH and buffering capacity provided by recirculated effluent from the UASB to the leach beds. The destruction of volatile solids for both the low and high dilution rates was similar with connection to the UASB, giving 82% and 88% volatile solids destruction respectively. This suggests that the most efficient leaching condition is 1 dilution per day with connection to the UASB.","","Available from http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.wasman.2013.06.025","","","","United States","2013-11-15T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: Waste Management; Journal Volume: 33; Journal Issue: 11; Other Information: Copyright (c) 2013 Elsevier Science B.V., Amsterdam, The Netherlands, All rights reserved.; Country of input: International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA)","","Medium: X; Size: page(s) 2470-2477","","","","Journal ID: ISSN 0956-053X; CODEN: WAMAE2; PII: S0956-053X(13)00302-4; TRN: US14R3327006498","10.1016/J.WASMAN.2013.06.025","","2015-01-27T00:00:00Z","22300325","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/22300325","","Waste Management","11","33"
"Emerging trends in informal sector recycling in developing and transition countries","Ezeah, Chukwunonye; Fazakerley, Jak A.; Roberts, Clive L.","12 MANAGEMENT OF RADIOACTIVE WASTES, AND NON-RADIOACTIVE WASTES FROM NUCLEAR FACILITIES; DEVELOPING COUNTRIES; ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT; ENVIRONMENTAL DEGRADATION; HEALTH HAZARDS; LEGAL ASPECTS; PUBLIC HEALTH; PUBLIC OPINION; RECYCLING; SOLID WASTES; URBAN AREAS; WASTE MANAGEMENT","Highlights: • Reviewed emerging trends in Informal Sector Recycling (ISR) in developing countries. • In some countries we found that ISR is the key factor in the recycling of waste materials. • Overall impact of ISR upon the urban economy and environment is positive. • In some instances ISR subsidises large areas of the formal sector. • Ignoring the informal sector could result in unsustainable interventions. - Abstract: Optimistic estimates suggest that only 30–70% of waste generated in cities of developing countries is collected for disposal. As a result, uncollected waste is often disposed of into open dumps, along the streets or into water bodies. Quite often, this practice induces environmental degradation and public health risks. Notwithstanding, such practices also make waste materials readily available for itinerant waste pickers. These ‘scavengers’ as they are called, therefore perceive waste as a resource, for income generation. Literature suggests that Informal Sector Recycling (ISR) activity can bring other benefits such as, economic growth, litter control and resources conservation. This paper critically reviews trends in ISR activities in selected developing and transition countries. ISR often survives in very hostile social and physical environments largely because of negative Government and public attitude. Rather than being stigmatised, the sector should be recognised as an important element for achievement of sustainable waste management in developing countries. One solution to this problem could be the integration of ISR into the formal waste management system. To achieve ISR integration, this paper highlights six crucial aspects from literature: social acceptance, political will, mobilisation of cooperatives, partnerships with private enterprises, management and technical skills, as well as legal protection measures. It is important to note that not every country will have the wherewithal to achieve social inclusion and so the level of integration must be ‘flexible’. In addition, the structure of the ISR should not be based on a ‘universal’ model but should instead take into account local contexts and conditions.","","Available from http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.wasman.2013.06.020","","","","United States","2013-11-15T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: Waste Management; Journal Volume: 33; Journal Issue: 11; Other Information: Copyright (c) 2013 Elsevier Science B.V., Amsterdam, The Netherlands, All rights reserved.; Country of input: International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA)","","Medium: X; Size: page(s) 2509-2519","","","","Journal ID: ISSN 0956-053X; CODEN: WAMAE2; PII: S0956-053X(13)00297-3; TRN: US14R3329006500","10.1016/J.WASMAN.2013.06.020","","2015-01-27T00:00:00Z","22300327","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/22300327","","Waste Management","11","33"

This paper shows how such factors have been developed for the recycling of glass, metals (Al and Fe), plastics and paper from municipal solid waste, as well as for the composting of garden refuse in South Africa. The emission factors developed for the different recyclables in the country show savings varying from −290 kg CO{sub 2} e (glass) to −19 111 kg CO{sub 2} e (metals – Al) per tonne of recyclable. They also show that there is variability, with energy intensive materials like metals having higher GHG savings in South Africa as compared to other countries. This underlines the interrelation of the waste management system of a country/region with other systems, in particular with energy generation, which in South Africa, is heavily reliant on coal. This study also shows that composting of garden waste is a net GHG emitter, releasing 172 and 186 kg CO{sub 2} e per tonne of wet garden waste for aerated dome composting and turned windrow composting, respectively. The paper concludes that these emission factors are facilitating GHG emissions modelling for waste management in South Africa and enabling local municipalities to identify best practice in this regard.","","Available from http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.wasman.2013.05.010","","","","United States","2013-11-15T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: Waste Management; Journal Volume: 33; Journal Issue: 11; Other Information: Copyright (c) 2013 Elsevier Science B.V., Amsterdam, The Netherlands, All rights reserved.; Country of input: International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA)","","Medium: X; Size: page(s) 2520-2531","","","","Journal ID: ISSN 0956-053X; CODEN: WAMAE2; PII: S0956-053X(13)00219-5; TRN: US14R3330006501","10.1016/J.WASMAN.2013.05.010","","2015-01-27T00:00:00Z","22300328","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/22300328","","Waste Management","11","33"

Specifically, the availability of consolidated engineering indexes is useful when new waste collection services are designed, along with when their performance is evaluated after a warm-up period. However, most published works in the field of MSWM complete their study with an analysis of isolated case studies. Conversely, decision makers require tools for information collection and exchange in order to trace the trends of these engineering indexes in large experiments. In this paper, common engineering indexes are presented and their values analysed in virtuous Italian communities, with the aim of contributing to the creation of a useful database whose data could be used during experiments, by indicating examples of MSWM demand profiles and the costs required to manage them.","","Available from http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.wasman.2013.06.003","","","","United States","2013-11-15T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: Waste Management; Journal Volume: 33; Journal Issue: 11; Other Information: Copyright (c) 2013 Elsevier Science B.V., Amsterdam, The Netherlands, All rights reserved.; Country of input: International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA)","","Medium: X; Size: page(s) 2532-2540","","","","Journal ID: ISSN 0956-053X; CODEN: WAMAE2; PII: S0956-053X(13)00260-2; TRN: US14R3331006502","10.1016/J.WASMAN.2013.06.003","","2015-01-27T00:00:00Z","22300329","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/22300329","","Waste Management","11","33"

Currently incentives and penalties have been internalized by the system no differently from other cost items and revenues. This has greatly influenced the system directing it towards solutions that are often distant from the real environmental objectives. Based on an analysis of disaggregated costs of collection treatment and recovery, we provide the basic elements to compose a picture of economic management in various technical–organizational scenarios. In the light of the considerations contained in the paper it is proposed, e.g. for controlled landfills, that the ecotax, currently based on weight, could be replaced by one based on the volume consumption. Likewise, for tax reduction on disposal system, instead a pre-treatment might ask an environmental balance of the overall system. The article presents a reflection on the last hidden costs associated with the consumption of goods and packaging, and how to reduce waste production is the necessary path to be followed in ecological and economic perspectives.","","Available from http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.wasman.2013.04.011","","","","United States","2013-11-15T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: Waste Management; Journal Volume: 33; Journal Issue: 11; Other Information: Copyright (c) 2013 Elsevier Science B.V., Amsterdam, The Netherlands, All rights reserved.; Country of input: International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA)","","Medium: X; Size: page(s) 2541-2547","","","","Journal ID: ISSN 0956-053X; CODEN: WAMAE2; PII: S0956-053X(13)00203-1; TRN: US14R3332006503","10.1016/J.WASMAN.2013.04.011","","2015-01-27T00:00:00Z","22300330","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/22300330","","Waste Management","11","33"

One MBT facility and a landfill with internal combustion engines fuelled by the landfill gas for electrical energy production operate in the waste management system considered. An experimental apparatus was used to simulate 0, 4, 8 and 16 weeks of aerobic stabilization and the consequent biogas potential (Nl/kg) of a large sample of MSOF withdrawn from the full-scale MBT. Stabilization achieved by the waste was evaluated by dynamic oxygen uptake and fermentation tests. Good correlation coefficients (R{sup 2}), ranging from 0.7668 to 0.9772, were found between oxygen uptake, fermentation and anaerobic test values. On the basis of the results of several anaerobic tests, the methane production rate k (year{sup −1}) was evaluated. k ranged from 0.436 to 0.308 year{sup −1} and the bio-methane potential from 37 to 12 N m{sup 3}/tonne, respectively, for the MSOF with 0 and 16 weeks of treatment. Energy recovery from landfill gas ranged from about 11 to 90 kW h per tonne of disposed MSOF depending on the different scenario investigated. Life cycle analysis showed that the scenario with 0 weeks of pre-treatment has the highest weighted global impact even if opposite results were obtained with respect to the single impact criteria. MSOF pre-treatment periods longer than 4 weeks showed rather negligible variation in the global impact of system emissions.","","Available from http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.wasman.2013.07.011","","","","United States","2013-11-15T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: Waste Management; Journal Volume: 33; Journal Issue: 11; Other Information: Copyright (c) 2013 Elsevier Science B.V., Amsterdam, The Netherlands, All rights reserved.; Country of input: International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA)","","Medium: X; Size: page(s) 2557-2567","","","","Journal ID: ISSN 0956-053X; CODEN: WAMAE2; PII: S0956-053X(13)00339-5; TRN: US14R3334006505","10.1016/J.WASMAN.2013.07.011","","2015-01-27T00:00:00Z","22300332","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/22300332","","Waste Management","11","33"

The project was devoted to support Lombardia Region in the drafting of the new waste management plan by applying a life cycle thinking perspective. The present paper mainly focuses on four Provinces in the Region, which were selected based on their peculiarities. Life cycle assessment (LCA) was adopted as the methodology to assess the current performance of the integrated waste management systems, to discuss strengths and weaknesses of each of them and to design their perspective evolution as of year 2020. Results show that despite a usual business approach that is beneficial to all the provinces, the introduction of technological and management improvements to the system provides in general additional energy and environmental benefits for all four provinces. The same improvements can be easily extended to the whole Region, leading to increased environmental benefits from the waste management sector, in line with the targets set by the European Union for 2020.","","Available from http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.wasman.2013.07.016","","","","United States","2013-11-15T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: Waste Management; Journal Volume: 33; Journal Issue: 11; Other Information: Copyright (c) 2013 Elsevier Science B.V., Amsterdam, The Netherlands, All rights reserved.; Country of input: International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA)","","Medium: X; Size: page(s) 2568-2578","","","","Journal ID: ISSN 0956-053X; CODEN: WAMAE2; PII: S0956-053X(13)00344-9; TRN: US14R3335006506","10.1016/J.WASMAN.2013.07.016","","2015-01-27T00:00:00Z","22300333","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/22300333","","Waste Management","11","33"

In the UK, 25 municipal waste incinerators with energy recovery are now in operation; however, their waste supply chains and business practices vary significantly. With over a hundred more plant developments being considered it is important to establish best business practices for ensuring efficient environmental and operational performance. By reviewing the 25 plants we identify four suitable case study plants to compare technologies (moving grate, fluidised bed and rotary kiln), plant economics and operations. Using data collected from annual reports and through interviews and site visits we provide recommendations for improving the supply chain for waste incinerators and highlight the current issues and challenges faced by the industry. We find that plants using moving grate have a high availability of 87–92%. However, compared to the fluidised bed and rotary kiln, quantities of bottom ash and emissions of hydrogen chloride and carbon monoxide are high. The uptake of integrated recycling practices, combined heat and power, and post incineration non-ferrous metal collections needs to be increased among EfW incinerators in the UK. We conclude that one of the major difficulties encountered by waste facilities is the appropriate selection of technology, capacity, site, waste suppliers and heat consumers. This study will be of particular value to EfW plant developers, government authorities and researchers working within the sector of waste management.","","Available from http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.wasman.2013.08.001","","","","United States","2013-11-15T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: Waste Management; Journal Volume: 33; Journal Issue: 11; Other Information: Copyright (c) 2013 Elsevier Science B.V., Amsterdam, The Netherlands, All rights reserved.; Country of input: International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA)","","Medium: X; Size: page(s) 2234-2244","","","","Journal ID: ISSN 0956-053X; CODEN: WAMAE2; PII: S0956-053X(13)00372-3; TRN: US14R3315006487","10.1016/J.WASMAN.2013.08.001","","2015-01-27T00:00:00Z","22300314","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/22300314","","Waste Management","11","33"

This article provides practical examples of how it has been carried out in two projects addressing waste management and energy issues respectively. Based on experiences from the two projects, recommendations are made for an approach concerning development of scenarios in projects dealing with both waste management and energy issues. Recommendations are given to develop and use overall scenarios for the project and leave room for sub-scenarios in parts of the project. Combining different types of scenarios is recommended, too, in order to adapt to the methods and tools of different disciplines, such as developing predictive scenarios with general equilibrium tools and analysing explorative scenarios with energy system analysis tools. Furthermore, as marginals identified in differing future background systems determine the outcomes of consequential life cycle assessments (LCAs), it is considered advisable to develop and use explorative external scenarios based on possible marginals as a framework for consequential LCAs. This approach is illustrated using an on-going Danish research project.","","Available from http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.wasman.2013.07.013","","","","United States","2013-11-15T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: Waste Management; Journal Volume: 33; Journal Issue: 11; Other Information: Copyright (c) 2013 Elsevier Science B.V., Amsterdam, The Netherlands, All rights reserved.; Country of input: International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA)","","Medium: X; Size: page(s) 2457-2464","","","","Journal ID: ISSN 0956-053X; CODEN: WAMAE2; PII: S0956-053X(13)00341-3; TRN: US14R3326006497","10.1016/J.WASMAN.2013.07.013","","2015-01-27T00:00:00Z","22300324","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/22300324","","Waste Management","11","33"

Certain more empirically based studies have also found that recycling is more expensive than disposal. Other work, both through models and surveys, have found differently. Here we present an empirical systems model, largely drawn from a suburban Long Island municipality. The model accounts for changes in distribution of effort as recycling tonnages displace disposal tonnages, and the seven different cases examined all show that curbside collection programs that manage up to between 31% and 37% of the waste stream should result in overall system savings. These savings accrue partially because of assumed cost differences in tip fees for recyclables and disposed wastes, and also because recycling can result in a more efficient, cost-effective collection program. These results imply that increases in recycling are justifiable due to cost-savings alone, not on more difficult to measure factors that may not impact program budgets.","","Available from http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.wasman.2013.06.012","","","","United States","2013-11-15T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: Waste Management; Journal Volume: 33; Journal Issue: 11; Other Information: Copyright (c) 2013 Elsevier Science B.V., Amsterdam, The Netherlands, All rights reserved.; Country of input: International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA)","","Medium: X; Size: page(s) 2548-2556","","","","Journal ID: ISSN 0956-053X; CODEN: WAMAE2; PII: S0956-053X(13)00289-4; TRN: US14R3333006504","10.1016/J.WASMAN.2013.06.012","","2015-01-27T00:00:00Z","22300331","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/22300331","","Waste Management","11","33"

Three types of landfill units were studied including a conventional landfill (Control cell), a new landfill area that had an air addition and recirculation piping network installed as waste was being placed (As-Built cell), and a conventional landfill that was modified to allow for liquids recirculation (Retrofit cell). During the monitoring period, the Retrofit, Control, and As-Built cells received 48, 14, and 213 L Mg{sup −1} (liters of liquids per metric ton of waste), respectively. The leachate collection system yielded 60, 57 and 198 L Mg{sup −1} from the Retrofit, Control, and As-Built cells, respectively. The head on liner in all cells was below regulatory limits. In the Control and As-Built cells, leachate head on liner decreased once waste placement stopped. The measured moisture content of the waste samples was consistent with that calculated from the estimate of accumulated liquid by the liquid balance. Additionally, measurements on excavated solid waste samples revealed large spatial variability in waste moisture content. The degree of saturation in the Control cells decreased from 85% to 75%. The degree of saturation increased from 82% to 83% due to liquids addition in the Retrofit cells and decreased back to 80% once liquid addition stopped. In the As-Built cells, the degree of saturation increased from 87% to 97% during filling activities and then started to decrease soon after filling activities stopped to reach 92% at the end of the monitoring period. The measured leachate generation rates were used to estimate an in-place saturated hydraulic conductivity of the MSW in the range of 10{sup −8} to 10{sup −7} m s{sup −1} which is lower than previous reports. In the Control and Retrofit cells, the net loss in liquids, 43 and 12 L Mg{sup −1}, respectively, was similar to the measured settlement of 15% and 5–8% strain, respectively (Abichou et al., 2013). The increase in net liquid volume in the As-Built cells indicates that the 37% (average) measured settlement strain in these cells cannot be due to consolidation as the waste mass did not lose any moisture but rather suggests that settlement was attributable to lubrication of waste particle contacts, softening of flexible porous materials, and additional biological degradation.","","Available from http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.wasman.2013.05.023","","","","United States","2013-10-15T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: Waste Management; Journal Volume: 33; Journal Issue: 10; Other Information: Copyright (c) 2013 Elsevier Science B.V., Amsterdam, The Netherlands, All rights reserved.; Country of input: International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA)","","Medium: X; Size: page(s) 2006-2014","","","","Journal ID: ISSN 0956-053X; CODEN: WAMAE2; PII: S0956-053X(13)00254-7; TRN: US14R3305006478","10.1016/J.WASMAN.2013.05.023","","2015-01-27T00:00:00Z","22300305","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/22300305","","Waste Management","10","33"

In this context, the in situ aeration of landfills has been recognised for its potential to convert conventional anaerobic landfills into biological stabilised state, whereby both current and potential (long-term) emissions of the landfilled waste are mitigated. In recent years, different in situ aeration concepts have been successfully applied in Europe, North America and Asia, all pursuing different objectives and strategies. In Austria, the first full-scale application of in situ landfill aeration by means of low pressure air injection and simultaneous off-gas collection and treatment was implemented on an old, small municipal solid waste (MSW) landfill (2.6 ha) in autumn 2007. Complementary laboratory investigations were conducted with waste samples taken from the landfill site in order to provide more information on the transferability of the results from lab- to full-scale aeration measures. In addition, long-term emission development of the stabilised waste after aeration completion was assessed in an ongoing laboratory experiment. Although the initial waste material was described as mostly stable in terms of the biological parameters gas generation potential over 21 days (GP{sub 21}) and respiration activity over 4 days (RA{sub 4}), the lab-scale experiments indicated that aeration, which led to a significant improvement of leachate quality, was accompanied by further measurable changes in the solid waste material under optimised conditions. Even 75 weeks after aeration completion the leachate, as well as gaseous emissions from the stabilised waste material, remained low and stayed below the authorised Austrian discharge limits. However, the application of in situ aeration at the investigated landfill is a factor 10 behind the lab-based predictions after 3 years of operation, mainly due to technical limitations in the full-scale operation (e.g. high air flow resistivity due to high water content of waste and temporarily high water levels within the landfill; limited efficiency of the aeration wells). In addition, material preparation (e.g. sieving, sorting and homogenisation) prior to the emplacement in Landfill Simulation Reactors (LSRs) must be considered when transferring results from lab- to full-scale application.","","Available from http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.wasman.2013.01.027","","","","United States","2013-10-15T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: Waste Management; Journal Volume: 33; Journal Issue: 10; Other Information: Copyright (c) 2013 Elsevier Science B.V., Amsterdam, The Netherlands, All rights reserved.; Country of input: International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA)","","Medium: X; Size: page(s) 2061-2073","","","","Journal ID: ISSN 0956-053X; CODEN: WAMAE2; PII: S0956-053X(13)00057-3; TRN: US14R3307006480","10.1016/J.WASMAN.2013.01.027","","2015-01-27T00:00:00Z","22300307","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/22300307","","Waste Management","10","33"

We investigated the isotopic signatures of δ{sup 13}C, δ{sup 2}H and δ{sup 18}O of different leachates from lab-scale experiments, lysimeter experiments and a landfill under in situ aeration. In the laboratory, columns filled with MSW of different age and reactivity were percolated under aerobic and anaerobic conditions. In landfill simulation reactors, waste of a 25 year old landfill was kept under aerobic and anaerobic conditions. The lysimeter facility was filled with mechanically shredded fresh waste. After starting of the methane production the waste in the lysimeter containments was aerated in situ. Leachate and gas composition were monitored continuously. In addition the seepage water of an old landfill was collected and analysed periodically before and during an in situ aeration. We found significant differences in the δ{sup 13}C-value of the dissolved inorganic carbon (δ{sup 13}C-DIC) of the leachate between aerobic and anaerobic waste material. During aerobic degradation, the signature of δ{sup 13}C-DIC was mainly dependent on the isotopic composition of the organic matter in the waste, resulting in a δ{sup 13}C-DIC of −20‰ to −25‰. The production of methane under anaerobic conditions caused an increase in δ{sup 13}C-DIC up to values of +10‰ and higher depending on the actual reactivity of the MSW. During aeration of a landfill the aerobic degradation of the remaining organic matter caused a decrease to a δ{sup 13}C-DIC of about −20‰. Therefore carbon isotope analysis in leachates and groundwater can be used for tracing the oxidation–reduction status of MSW landfills. Our results indicate that monitoring of stable isotopic signatures of landfill leachates over a longer time period (e.g. during in situ aeration) is a powerful and cost-effective tool for characterising the biodegradability and stability of the organic matter in landfilled municipal solid waste and can be used for monitoring the progress of in situ aeration.","","Available from http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.wasman.2013.02.017","","","","United States","2013-10-15T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: Waste Management; Journal Volume: 33; Journal Issue: 10; Other Information: Copyright (c) 2013 Elsevier Science B.V., Amsterdam, The Netherlands, All rights reserved.; Country of input: International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA)","","Medium: X; Size: page(s) 2083-2090","","","","Journal ID: ISSN 0956-053X; CODEN: WAMAE2; PII: S0956-053X(13)00105-0; TRN: US14R3308006481","10.1016/J.WASMAN.2013.02.017","","2015-01-27T00:00:00Z","22300308","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/22300308","","Waste Management","10","33"

However, they cause waste and soil pollution and they do not easily decompose. Many promising technologies are being investigated for separating mixed thermoplastics, but they are still uneconomical and unreliable. Depending on their surface characteristics, these plastics can be separated from each other by flotation method which is useful mineral processing technique with its low cost and simplicity. The main objective of this study is to investigate the flotation characteristics of PET and PVC and determine the effect of plasticizer reagents on efficient plastic separation. For that purpose, various parameters such as pH, plasticizer concentration, plasticizer type, conditioning temperature and thermal conditioning were investigated. As a result, PET particles were floated with 95.1% purity and 65.3% efficiency while PVC particles were obtained with 98.1% purity and 65.3% efficiency.","","Available from http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.wasman.2013.05.006","","","","United States","2013-09-15T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: Waste Management; Journal Volume: 33; Journal Issue: 9; Other Information: Copyright (c) 2013 Elsevier Science B.V., Amsterdam, The Netherlands, All rights reserved.; Country of input: International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA)","","Medium: X; Size: page(s) 1795-1799","","","","Journal ID: ISSN 0956-053X; CODEN: WAMAE2; PII: S0956-053X(13)00215-8; TRN: US14R3400006550","10.1016/J.WASMAN.2013.05.006","","2015-01-27T00:00:00Z","22300377","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/22300377","","Waste Management","9","33"

The most economically and environmentally advantageous methods for the treatment and recycling of waste electric and electronic equipment (WEEE) are the thermal techniques such as direct combustion, co-combustion with plastic wastes, pyrolysis and gasification. Nowadays, this kind of waste is mainly thermally treated in incinerators (e.g. rotary kilns) to decompose the plastics present, and to concentrate metals in bottom ash. The concentrated metals (e.g. copper, precious metals) can be supplied as a secondary raw material to metal smelters, while the pyrolysis of plastics allows the recovery of fuel gases, volatilising agents and, eventually, energy. Indeed, WEEE, such as a printed circuit boards (PCBs) usually contains brominated flame retardants (BFRs). From these materials, hydrobromic acid (HBr) is formed as a product of their thermal decomposition. In the present work, the bromination was studied of copper, silver and gold by HBr, originating from BFRs, such as Tetrabromobisphenol A (TBBPA) and Tetrabromobisphenol A-Tetrabromobisophenol A diglycidyl ether (TTDE) polymer; possible volatilization of the bromides formed was monitored using a thermo-gravimetric analyzer (TGA) and a laboratory-scale furnace for treating samples of metals and BFRs under an inert atmosphere and at a wide range of temperatures. The results obtained indicate that up to about 50% of copper and silver can evolve from sample residues in the form of volatile CuBr and AgBr above 600 and 1000 °C, respectively. The reactions occur in the molten resin phase simultaneously with the decomposition of the brominated resin. Gold is resistant to HBr and remains unchanged in the residue.","","Available from http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.wasman.2013.05.009","","","","United States","2013-09-15T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: Waste Management; Journal Volume: 33; Journal Issue: 9; Other Information: Copyright (c) 2013 Elsevier Science B.V., Amsterdam, The Netherlands, All rights reserved.; Country of input: International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA)","","Medium: X; Size: page(s) 1835-1842","","","","Journal ID: ISSN 0956-053X; CODEN: WAMAE2; PII: S0956-053X(13)00218-3; TRN: US14R3401006551","10.1016/J.WASMAN.2013.05.009","","2015-01-27T00:00:00Z","22300378","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/22300378","","Waste Management","9","33"

For this purpose, topical research including monitoring results regarding the gas balance at MBT landfills was evaluated. For waste treated to the required German standards, a methane formation potential of approximately 18–24 m{sup 3} CH{sub 4}/t of total dry solids may be expected. Monitoring results from MBT landfills show that a three-phase model with differentiated half-lives describes the degradation kinetics in the best way. This is due to the fact that during the first years of disposal, the anaerobic degradation processes still proceed relatively intensively. In addition in the long term (decades), a residual gas production at a low level is still to be expected. Most of the soils used in recultivation layer systems at German landfills show a relatively high methane oxidation capacity up to 5 l CH{sub 4}/(m{sup 2} h). However, measurements at MBT disposal sites indicate that the majority of the landfill gas (in particular at non-covered areas), leaves the landfill body via preferred gas emission zones (hot spots) without significant methane oxidation. Therefore, rather low methane oxidation factors are recommended for open and temporarily covered MBT landfills. Higher methane oxidation rates can be achieved when the soil/recultivation layer is adequately designed and operated. Based on the elaborated default values, the First Order Decay (FOD) model of the IPCC Guidelines for National Greenhouse Gas Inventories, 2006, was used to estimate the methane emissions from MBT landfills. Due to the calculation made by the authors emissions in the range of 60,000–135,000 t CO{sub 2-eq.}/a for all German MBT landfills can be expected. This wide range shows the uncertainties when the here used procedure and the limited available data are applied. It is therefore necessary to generate more data in the future in order to calculate more precise methane emission rates from MBT landfills. This is important for the overall calculation of the climate gas production in Germany which is required once a year by the German Government.","","Available from http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.wasman.2013.05.012","","","","United States","2013-09-15T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: Waste Management; Journal Volume: 33; Journal Issue: 9; Other Information: Copyright (c) 2013 Elsevier Science B.V., Amsterdam, The Netherlands, All rights reserved.; Country of input: International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA)","","Medium: X; Size: page(s) 1853-1860","","","","Journal ID: ISSN 0956-053X; CODEN: WAMAE2; PII: S0956-053X(13)00221-3; TRN: US14R3402006552","10.1016/J.WASMAN.2013.05.012","","2015-01-27T00:00:00Z","22300379","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/22300379","","Waste Management","9","33"

Optimization models can assist in ensuring that these investment strategies are economically feasible. Various economic optimization models for waste treatment have been developed which focus on different parameters. Models focusing on transport are one example, but models focusing on energy production have also been developed, as well as models which take into account a plant’s economies of scale, environmental impact, material recovery and social costs. Finally, models combining different criteria for the selection of waste treatment methods in multi-criteria analysis have been developed. A thorough updated review of the existing models is presented, and the main challenges and crucial parameters that need to be taken into account when assessing the economic performance of waste treatment alternatives are identified.

The current study is assessing the historical development of MSWM in the municipality of Aalborg, Denmark throughout the period of 1970 to 2010, and its implications regarding Global Warming Potential (GWP{sub 100}), using the Life Cycle Assessment (LCA) approach. Historical data regarding MSW composition, and different treatment technologies such as incineration, recycling and composting has been used in order to perform the analysis. The LCA results show a continuous improvement in environmental performance of MSWM from 1970 to 2010 mainly due to the changes in treatment options, improved efficiency of various treatment technologies and increasing focus on recycling, resulting in a shift from net emission of 618 kg CO{sub 2}-eq. tonne{sup −1} to net saving of 670 kg CO{sub 2}-eq. tonne{sup −1} of MSWM.","","Available from http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.wasman.2013.04.016","","","","United States","2013-09-15T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: Waste Management; Journal Volume: 33; Journal Issue: 9; Other Information: Copyright (c) 2013 Elsevier Science B.V., Amsterdam, The Netherlands, All rights reserved.; Country of input: International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA)","","Medium: X; Size: page(s) 1926-1933","","","","Journal ID: ISSN 0956-053X; CODEN: WAMAE2; PII: S0956-053X(13)00208-0; TRN: US14R3406006556","10.1016/J.WASMAN.2013.04.016","","2015-01-27T00:00:00Z","22300383","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/22300383","","Waste Management","9","33"

The last twenty years they are used all the more often in Municipal Solid Waste (MSW) management in order to provide optimal solutions with the cost objective being the usual driver of the optimization. In our work we consider the GHG emissions as an additional criterion, aiming at a multi-objective approach. The Pareto front (Cost vs. GHG emissions) of the system is generated using an appropriate multi-objective method. This information is essential to the decision maker because he can explore the trade-offs in the Pareto curve and select his most preferred among the Pareto optimal solutions. In the present work a detailed multi-objective, multi-period mathematical programming model is developed in order to describe the waste management problem. Apart from the bi-objective approach, the major innovations of the model are (1) the detailed modeling considering 34 materials and 42 technologies, (2) the detailed calculation of the energy content of the various streams based on the detailed material balances, and (3) the incorporation of the IPCC guidelines for the CH{sub 4} generated in the landfills (first order decay model). The equations of the model are described in full detail. Finally, the whole approach is illustrated with a case study referring to the application of the model in a Greek region.","","Available from http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.wasman.2013.04.012","","","","United States","2013-09-15T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: Waste Management; Journal Volume: 33; Journal Issue: 9; Other Information: Copyright (c) 2013 Elsevier Science B.V., Amsterdam, The Netherlands, All rights reserved.; Country of input: International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA)","","Medium: X; Size: page(s) 1934-1949","","","","Journal ID: ISSN 0956-053X; CODEN: WAMAE2; PII: S0956-053X(13)00204-3; TRN: US14R3407006557","10.1016/J.WASMAN.2013.04.012","","2015-01-27T00:00:00Z","22300384","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/22300384","","Waste Management","9","33"
"The changing character of household waste in the Czech Republic between 1999 and 2009 as a function of home heating methods","Doležalová, Markéta; Benešová, Libuše; Závodská, Anita","54 ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCES; 12 MANAGEMENT OF RADIOACTIVE WASTES, AND NON-RADIOACTIVE WASTES FROM NUCLEAR FACILITIES; ASHES; COAL; CZECH REPUBLIC; ENERGY RECOVERY; ENVIRONMENT; EUROPEAN UNION; HEATING; HOUSEHOLDS; LEGISLATION; MOISTURE; MUNICIPAL WASTES; SOLID FUELS; SOLID WASTES; STATE GOVERNMENT; WASTE MANAGEMENT","Highlights: • The character of household waste in the three different types of households were assesed. • The quantity, density and composition of household waste were determined. • The physicochemical characteristics were determined. • The changing character of household waste during past 10 years was described. • The potential of energy recovery of household waste in Czech republic was assesed. - Abstract: The authors of this paper report on the changing character of household waste, in the Czech Republic between 1999 and 2009 in households differentiated by their heating methods. The data presented are the result of two projects, financed by the Czech Ministry of Environment, which were undertaken during this time period with the aim of focusing on the waste characterisation and complete analysis of the physicochemical properties of the household waste. In the Czech Republic, the composition of household waste varies significantly between different types of households based on the methods of home heating employed. For the purposes of these studies, the types of homes were divided into three categories – urban, mixed and rural. Some of the biggest differences were found in the quantities of certain subsample categories, especially fine residue (matter smaller than 20 mm), between urban households with central heating and rural households that primarily employ solid fuel such coal or wood. The use of these solid fuels increases the fraction of the finer categories because of the higher presence of ash. Heating values of the residual household waste from the three categories varied very significantly, ranging from 6.8 MJ/kg to 14.2 MJ/kg in 1999 and from 6.8 MJ/kg to 10.5 MJ/kg in 2009 depending on the type of household and season. The same factors affect moisture of residual household waste which varied from 23.2% to 33.3%. The chemical parameters also varied significantly, especially in the quantities of Tl, As, Cr, Zn, Fe and Mn, which were higher in rural households. Because knowledge about the properties of household waste, as well as its physicochemical characteristics, is very important not only for future waste management, but also for the prediction of the behaviour and influence of the waste on the environment as the country continues to streamline its legislation to the European Union’s solid waste mandates, the results of these studies were employed by the Czech Ministry of Environment to optimise the national waste management strategy.","","Available from http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.wasman.2013.04.017","","","","United States","2013-09-15T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: Waste Management; Journal Volume: 33; Journal Issue: 9; Other Information: Copyright (c) 2013 Elsevier Science B.V., Amsterdam, The Netherlands, All rights reserved.; Country of input: International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA)","","Medium: X; Size: page(s) 1950-1957","","","","Journal ID: ISSN 0956-053X; CODEN: WAMAE2; PII: S0956-053X(13)00209-2; TRN: US14R3408006558","10.1016/J.WASMAN.2013.04.017","","2015-01-27T00:00:00Z","22300385","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/22300385","","Waste Management","9","33"
"Experimental evidence of colloids and nanoparticles presence from 25 waste leachates","Hennebert, Pierre; Avellan, Astrid; Yan, Junfang; Aguerre-Chariol, Olivier","54 ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCES; 12 MANAGEMENT OF RADIOACTIVE WASTES, AND NON-RADIOACTIVE WASTES FROM NUCLEAR FACILITIES; CARBON DIOXIDE; COLLOIDS; COMPOST; CONCENTRATION RATIO; ENVIRONMENT; FILTRATION; LEACHATES; MUNICIPAL WASTES; ORGANIC MATTER; ORGANIC POLYMERS; POLLUTANTS; SAMPLE PREPARATION; SANITARY LANDFILLS; SOLID WASTES; SPECTROSCOPY; TRANSMISSION ELECTRON MICROSCOPY; NANOPARTICLES","Highlights: • This work is the first assessment of colloids in waste leachates. • Analytical methods are proposed and discussed. • All the waste have at least one element in colloidal form, and some elements are always colloidal. • Man-made nanoparticles are observed. • It can change the interpretation of leachate elemental concentration. - Abstract: The potential colloids release from a large panel of 25 solid industrial and municipal waste leachates, contaminated soil, contaminated sediments and landfill leachates was studied. Standardized leaching, cascade filtrations and measurement of element concentrations in the microfiltrate (MF) and ultrafiltrate (UF) fraction were used to easily detect colloids potentially released by waste. Precautions against CO{sub 2} capture by alkaline leachates, or bacterial re-growth in leachates from wastes containing organic matter should be taken. Most of the colloidal particles were visible by transmission electron microscopy with energy dispersion spectrometry (TEM–EDS) if their elemental MF concentration is greater than 200 μg l{sup −1}. If the samples are dried during the preparation for microscopy, neoformation of particles can occur from the soluble part of the element. Size distribution analysis measured by photon correlation spectroscopy (PCS) were frequently unvalid, particularly due to polydispersity and/or too low concentrations in the leachates. A low sensitivity device is required, and further improvement is desirable in that field. For some waste leachates, particles had a zeta potential strong enough to remain in suspension. Mn, As, Co, Pb, Sn, Zn had always a colloidal form (MF concentration/UF concentration > 1.5) and total organic carbon (TOC), Fe, P, Ba, Cr, Cu, Ni are partly colloidal for more than half of the samples). Nearly all the micro-pollutants (As, Ba, Co, Cr, Cu, Mo, Ni, Pb, Sb, Sn, V and Zn) were found at least once in colloidal form greater than 100 μg l{sup −1}. In particular, the colloidal forms of Zn were always by far more concentrated than its dissolved form. The TEM–EDS method showed various particles, including manufactured nanoparticles (organic polymer, TiO{sub 2}, particles with Sr, La, Ce, Nd). All the waste had at least one element detected as colloidal. The solid waste leachates contained significant amount of colloids different in elemental composition from natural ones. The majority of the elements were in colloidal form for wastes of packaging (3), a steel slag, a sludge from hydrometallurgy, composts (2), a dredged sediment (#18), an As contaminated soil and two active landfill leachates. These results showed that cascade filtration and ICP elemental analysis seems valid methods in this field, and that electronic microscopy with elemental detection allows to identify particles. Particles can be formed from dissolved elements during TEM sample preparation and cross-checking with MF and UF composition by ICP is useful. The colloidal fraction of leachate of waste seems to be a significant source term, and should be taken into account in studies of emission and transfer of contaminants in the environment. Standardized cross-filtration method could be amended for the presence of colloids in waste leachates.","","Available from http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.wasman.2013.04.014","","","","United States","2013-09-15T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: Waste Management; Journal Volume: 33; Journal Issue: 9; Other Information: Copyright (c) 2013 Elsevier Science B.V., Amsterdam, The Netherlands, All rights reserved.; Country of input: International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA)","","Medium: X; Size: page(s) 1870-1881","","","","Journal ID: ISSN 0956-053X; CODEN: WAMAE2; PII: S0956-053X(13)00206-7; TRN: US14R3403006553","10.1016/J.WASMAN.2013.04.014","","2015-01-27T00:00:00Z","22300380","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/22300380","","Waste Management","9","33"

The geochemical transport and fate of radioiodine depends largely on its chemical speciation that is greatly affected by environmental factors. This study reports, for the first time, the speciation of stable and radioactive iodine in the groundwater from the Hanford Site. Iodate was the dominant species and accounts for up to 84%, followed by organo-iodine and minimal levels of iodide. The relatively high pH and oxidizing environment may have prevented iodate reduction. Our results identified that calcite precipitation caused by degassing of CO2 during deep groundwater sampling incorporated between 7 to 40% of dissolved iodine (including 127I and 129I) that was originally in the groundwater, transforming dissolved to particulate iodate during sampling. In order to understand the mechanisms underlying iodine incorporation by calcite, laboratory experiments were carried out to replicate this iodine sequestering processes. Two methods were utilized in this study, 1) addition of sodium carbonate; 2) addition of calcium chloride followed by sodium carbonate where the pH was well controlled at ~8.2, which is close to the average pH of Hanford Site groundwater. It was demonstrated that iodate was the main species incorporated into calcite and this incorporation process could be impeded by elevated pH and decreasing ionic strength in groundwater. This study provides critical information for predicting the long-term fate and transport of 129I at the Hanford Site and reveals a potential means for improved remediation strategies of 129I.","American Chemical Society (ACS)","","Pacific Northwest National Lab.

While low-temperature melting is necessary for reduced energy consumption, previously proposed methods required high melting temperatures (1400 °C) for the reduction melting. In this study, the reduction melting of the funnel glass was performed at 900–1000 °C using a lab-scale reactor with varying concentrations of Na{sub 2}CO{sub 3} at different melting temperatures and melting times. The optimum Na{sub 2}CO{sub 3} dosage and melting temperature for efficient lead recovery was 0.5 g per 1 g of the funnel glass and 1000 °C respectively. By the reduction melting with the mentioned conditions, 92% of the lead in the funnel glass was recovered in 60 min. However, further lead recovery was difficult because the rate of the lead recovery decreased as with the recovery of increasing quantity of the lead from the glass. Thus, the lead remaining in the glass after the reduction melting was extracted with 1 M HCl, and the lead recovery improved to 98%.","","Available from http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.wasman.2013.04.009","","","","United States","2013-08-15T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: Waste Management; Journal Volume: 33; Journal Issue: 8; Other Information: Copyright (c) 2013 Elsevier Science B.V., Amsterdam, The Netherlands, All rights reserved.; Country of input: International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA)","","Medium: X; Size: page(s) 1758-1763","","","","Journal ID: ISSN 0956-053X; CODEN: WAMAE2; PII: S0956-053X(13)00201-8; TRN: US14R3398006548","10.1016/J.WASMAN.2013.04.009","","2015-01-27T00:00:00Z","22300375","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/22300375","","Waste Management","8","33"

The paper proposes a more coherent taxation approach for Europe that is based on the principle of Pigovian taxation, i.e. the internalization of environmental damage costs. The approach aims to create a level playing field between European regions while reinforcing incentives for sustainable management of combustible waste. Three important policy recommendations emerge. First, integrating waste incineration into the European Emissions Trading System for greenhouse gases (EU ETS) reduces the risk of tax competition between regions. Second, because taxation of every single air pollutant from waste incineration is cumbersome, a differentiated waste incineration tax based on NO{sub x} emissions can serve as a second-best instrument. Finally, in order to strengthen incentives for ash treatment, a landfill tax should apply for landfilled incineration residues. An example illustrates the coherence of the policy recommendations for incineration technologies with diverse environmental effects.","","Available from http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.wasman.2013.03.015","","","","United States","2013-08-15T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: Waste Management; Journal Volume: 33; Journal Issue: 8; Other Information: Copyright (c) 2013 Elsevier Science B.V., Amsterdam, The Netherlands, All rights reserved.; Country of input: International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA)","","Medium: X; Size: page(s) 1776-1783","","","","Journal ID: ISSN 0956-053X; CODEN: WAMAE2; PII: S0956-053X(13)00157-8; TRN: US14R3399006549","10.1016/J.WASMAN.2013.03.015","","2015-01-27T00:00:00Z","22300376","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/22300376","","Waste Management","8","33"

Diffusion and sorption are fundamental mechanisms controlling RN migration in rocks and many experimental approaches are applied to determine transport parameters for low sorbing RN in homogeneous rocks. However, it is difficult to obtain relevant data for high sorbing RN or colloids, for which diffusion lengths are extremely short, or within heterogeneous rocks, where transport might be different in different minerals. The ion beam techniques Rutherford Backscattering Spectrometry (RBS) and micro-Particle Induced X-Ray Emission ({mu}PIXE), rarely applied in the field, were selected for their micro-analytical potential to study RN diffusion and surface retention within heterogeneous rocks.

The energy footprint of transportation needs, pre-treatment and reprocessing of recyclable materials was 3–9.5%, 1–18% and 1–8% respectively, relative to total energy savings. Mass combustion WtE achieved the highest savings in scenarios with CHP production, nonetheless, MBT-based systems had similarly high performance if SRF streams were co-combusted with coal. When RDF and SRF was only used in dedicated WtE plants, MBT-based systems totalled lower savings due to inherent system losses and additional energy costs. In scenarios without heat recovery, the biodrying MBS-based system achieved the highest savings, on the condition of SRF co-combustion. As a sensitivity scenario, alternative utilisation of SRF in cement kilns was modelled. It supported similar or higher net savings for all pre-treatment systems compared to mass combustion WtE, except when WtE CHP was possible in the first two background energy scenarios. Recovery of plastics for recycling before energy recovery increased net energy savings in most scenario variations, over those of full stream combustion. Sensitivity to assumptions regarding virgin plastic substitution was tested and was found to mostly favour plastic recovery.","","Available from http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.wasman.2013.03.026","","","","United States","2013-07-15T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: Waste Management; Journal Volume: 33; Journal Issue: 7; Other Information: Copyright (c) 2013 Elsevier Science B.V., Amsterdam, The Netherlands, All rights reserved.; Country of input: International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA)","","Medium: X; Size: page(s) 1648-1658","","","","Journal ID: ISSN 0956-053X; CODEN: WAMAE2; PII: S0956-053X(13)00168-2; TRN: US14R3394006544","10.1016/J.WASMAN.2013.03.026","","2015-01-27T00:00:00Z","22300371","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/22300371","","Waste Management","7","33"
"Development Of Chemical Reduction And Air Stripping Processes To Remove Mercury From Wastewater","Jackson, Dennis G.; Looney, Brian B.; Craig, Robert R.; Thompson, Martha C.; Kmetz, Thomas F.","12 MANAGEMENT OF RADIOACTIVE AND NON-RADIOACTIVE WASTES FROM NUCLEAR FACILITIES; Mercury; Pollutants; Permits; Waste Treatment Plants; Chemical treatment; Volatilization; Oxidation.","This study evaluates the removal of mercury from wastewater using chemical reduction and air stripping using a full-scale treatment system at the Savannah River Site. The existing water treatment system utilizes air stripping as the unit operation to remove organic compounds from groundwater that also contains mercury (C ~ 250 ng/L). The baseline air stripping process was ineffective in removing mercury and the water exceeded a proposed limit of 51 ng/L. To test an enhancement to the existing treatment modality a continuous dose of reducing agent was injected for 6-hours at the inlet of the air stripper. This action resulted in the chemical reduction of mercury to Hg(0), a species that is removable with the existing unit operation. During the injection period a 94% decrease in concentration was observed and the effluent satisfied proposed limits. The process was optimized over a 2-day period by sequentially evaluating dose rates ranging from 0.64X to 297X stoichiometry. A minimum dose of 16X stoichiometry was necessary to initiate the reduction reaction that facilitated the mercury removal. Competing electron acceptors likely inhibited the reaction at the lower 1 doses, which prevented removal by air stripping. These results indicate that chemical reduction coupled with air stripping can effectively treat large-volumes of water to emerging part per trillion regulatory standards for mercury.","","","Savannah River Site (SRS), Aiken, SC (United States)","USDOE (United States)","","United States","2013-07-10T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: ASCE Journal of Environmental Engineering; Journal Volume: 139; Journal Issue: 11","","Medium: ED; Size: 26 p.","","SRNL-STI-2013-00409","DE-AC09-08SR22470","Journal ID: ISSN 0733--9372; TRN: US1400099","10.1061/(ASCE)EE.1943-7870.0000761","","2014-04-03T00:00:00Z","1097601","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/1097601","https://www.osti.gov/servlets/purl/1097601","ASCE Journal of Environmental Engineering","11","139"

It is important in many applications such as flame retardants and in the production of polyester, which can trigger an investigation of the leachability of antimony from plastics using different acids. In this paper, different types of acids are tested for their ability to leach antimony from a discarded computer housing, made of poly(acrylonitrile butadiene styrene), which is a common plastic type used in electrical and electronic equipment. The acid solutions included sodium hydrogen tartrate (0.5 M) dissolved in either dimethyl sulfoxide or water (at ca. 23 °C and heated to ca. 105 °C). The metal content after leaching was determined by inductively coupled plasma optical emission spectroscopy. The most efficient leaching medium was the heated solution of sodium hydrogen tartrate in dimethyl sulfoxide, which leached almost half of the antimony from the poly(acrylonitrile butadiene styrene). Gamma irradiation, which is proposed to improve the mechanical properties in plastics, was used here to investigate the influence of antimony leaching ability. No significant change in the amount of leached antimony could be observed.","","Available from http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.wasman.2013.03.002","","","","United States","2013-06-15T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: Waste Management; Journal Volume: 33; Journal Issue: 6; Other Information: Copyright (c) 2013 Elsevier Science B.V., Amsterdam, The Netherlands, All rights reserved.; Country of input: International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA)","","Medium: X; Size: page(s) 1478-1482","","","","Journal ID: ISSN 0956-053X; CODEN: WAMAE2; PII: S0956-053X(13)00118-9; TRN: US14R3385010770","10.1016/J.WASMAN.2013.03.002","","2015-01-30T00:00:00Z","22304598","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/22304598","","Waste Management","6","33"

The analysis was focused particularly on the data about the treatment of end-of-life cooling and freezing equipments. In fact, the wastes of cooling and freezing equipments have a high environmental impact. Indeed, in their compressor oil and insulation polyurethane (PU) foams chlorofluorocarbon (CFC) ozone-depleting gases are still present. In the period 2001–2004 Northern Italy resulted the main source in Europe of CFCs. The European Directive on WEEE management was enacted in 2002, but in Italy it was implemented by the legislative Decree in 2005 and it became operational in 2008. Actually, in 2008 the national WEEE Coordination Centre was founded in order to organize the WEEE pick-up process and to control collection, recovery and recycling targets. As a result, in 2010 the average WEEE collection per capita exceeded the threshold of more than 4 kg per inhabitant, as well as cooling and freezing appliances represented more than one fourth of the Italian WEEE collection stream. During the treatment of end-of-life cooling and freezing equipments, CFCs were recovered and disposed principally by burner methods. The analyses of defined specimens collected in the treatment facilities were standardized to reliably determine the amount of recovered CFCs. Samples of alkaline solid salt, alkaline saline solution, polyurethane matrix and compressor oil collected during the audit assessment procedure were analyzed and the results were discussed. In particular, the analysis of PU samples after the shredding and the warm pressing procedures measured a residual CFCs content around 500–1300 mg/kg of CFCs within the foam matrix.","","Available from http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.wasman.2013.03.012","","","","United States","2013-06-15T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: Waste Management; Journal Volume: 33; Journal Issue: 6; Other Information: Copyright (c) 2013 Elsevier Science B.V., Amsterdam, The Netherlands, All rights reserved.; Country of input: International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA)","","Medium: X; Size: page(s) 1491-1498","","","","Journal ID: ISSN 0956-053X; CODEN: WAMAE2; PII: S0956-053X(13)00154-2; TRN: US14R3387010771","10.1016/J.WASMAN.2013.03.012","","2015-01-30T00:00:00Z","22304599","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/22304599","","Waste Management","6","33"

Comprehensive information on waste generation for month-scale, medium-term and long-term time scales is especially needed, considering the necessity of MSW management upgrade facing many developing countries. Several existing models are available but of little use in forecasting MSW generation at multiple time scales. The goal of this study is to propose a hybrid model that combines the seasonal autoregressive integrated moving average (SARIMA) model and grey system theory to forecast MSW generation at multiple time scales without needing to consider other variables such as demographics and socioeconomic factors. To demonstrate its applicability, a case study of Xiamen City, China was performed. Results show that the model is robust enough to fit and forecast seasonal and annual dynamics of MSW generation at month-scale, medium- and long-term time scales with the desired accuracy. In the month-scale, MSW generation in Xiamen City will peak at 132.2 thousand tonnes in July 2015 – 1.5 times the volume in July 2010. In the medium term, annual MSW generation will increase to 1518.1 thousand tonnes by 2015 at an average growth rate of 10%. In the long term, a large volume of MSW will be output annually and will increase to 2486.3 thousand tonnes by 2020 – 2.5 times the value for 2010. The hybrid model proposed in this paper can enable decision makers to develop integrated policies and measures for waste management over the long term.","","Available from http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.wasman.2013.02.012","","","","United States","2013-06-15T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: Waste Management; Journal Volume: 33; Journal Issue: 6; Other Information: Copyright (c) 2013 Elsevier Science B.V., Amsterdam, The Netherlands, All rights reserved.; Country of input: International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA)","","Medium: X; Size: page(s) 1324-1331","","","","Journal ID: ISSN 0956-053X; CODEN: WAMAE2; PII: S0956-053X(13)00082-2; TRN: US14R3378006531","10.1016/J.WASMAN.2013.02.012","","2015-01-27T00:00:00Z","22300358","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/22300358","","Waste Management","6","33"

Performance enhancement was evaluated in three LBRs M, D and U at 22 ± 3 °C using three water addition and leachate recycle strategies; water addition was downflow in D throughout, intermittently upflow and downflow in M and U with 77% volume downflow in M, 54% volume downflow in U while the rest were upflow. Leachate recycle was downflow in D, alternately downflow and upflow in M and upflow in U. The strategy adopted in U led to more water addition (30.3%), leachate production (33%) and chemical oxygen demand (COD) solubilisation (33%; 1609 g against 1210 g) compared to D (control). The total and volatile solids (TS and VS) reductions were similar but the highest COD yield (g-COD/g-TS and g-COD/g-VS removed) was in U (1.6 and 1.9); the values were 1.33 and 1.57 for M, and 1.18 and 1.41 for D respectively.

A central composite design (CCD) with response surface methodology (RSM) was applied to evaluate the relationships between operating variables, such as ozone and persulfate dosages, pH, and reaction time, to identify the optimum operating conditions. Quadratic models for the following four responses proved to be significant with very low probabilities (<0.0001): COD, color, NH{sub 3}–N, and ozone consumption (OC). The obtained optimum conditions included a reaction time of 210 min, 30 g/m{sup 3} ozone, 1 g/1 g COD{sub 0}/S{sub 2}O{sub 8}{sup 2-} ratio, and pH 10.

The combined method (i.e., O{sub 3}/S{sub 2}O{sub 8}{sup 2-}) achieved higher removal efficiencies for COD, color, and NH{sub 3}–N compared with other studied applications. Furthermore, the new method is more efficient than ozone/Fenton in advanced oxidation process in the treatment of the same studied leachate.","","Available from http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.wasman.2013.01.039","","","","United States","2013-06-15T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: Waste Management; Journal Volume: 33; Journal Issue: 6; Other Information: Copyright (c) 2013 Elsevier Science B.V., Amsterdam, The Netherlands, All rights reserved.; Country of input: International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA)","","Medium: X; Size: page(s) 1434-1441","","","","Journal ID: ISSN 0956-053X; CODEN: WAMAE2; PII: S0956-053X(13)00073-1; TRN: US14R3384006536","10.1016/J.WASMAN.2013.01.039","","2015-01-27T00:00:00Z","22300363","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/22300363","","Waste Management","6","33"

The specifications establish quality standards to be met by the agricultural plastics producers, users and the agricultural plastic waste management chain. They constitute the base for the best economical and environmental valorisation of the APW. The analysis of the APW streams conducted across Europe in the framework of the European project “LabelAgriWaste” revealed the inherent characteristics of the APW streams and the inherent constraints (technical or economical) of the APW. The APW stream properties related to its recycling potential and measured during pilot trials are presented and a subsequent universally accepted simplified and expanded list of APW recycling technical specifications is proposed and justified. The list includes two sets of specifications, applied to two different quality categories of recyclable APW: one for pellet production process (“Quality I”) and another one for plastic profile production process (“Quality II”). Parameters that are taken into consideration in the specifications include the APW physical characteristics, contamination, composition and degradation. The proposed specifications are focused on polyethylene based APW that represents the vast majority of the APW stream. However, the specifications can be adjusted to cover also APW of different materials (e.g. PP or PVC) that are found in very small quantities in protected cultivations in Europe. The adoption of the proposed specifications could transform this waste stream into a labelled commodity traded freely in the market and will constitute the base for the best economical and environmental valorisation of the APW.","","Available from http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.wasman.2013.03.004","","","","United States","2013-06-15T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: Waste Management; Journal Volume: 33; Journal Issue: 6; Other Information: Copyright (c) 2013 Elsevier Science B.V., Amsterdam, The Netherlands, All rights reserved.; Country of input: International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA)","","Medium: X; Size: page(s) 1516-1530","","","","Journal ID: ISSN 0956-053X; CODEN: WAMAE2; PII: S0956-053X(13)00120-7; TRN: US14R3388006538","10.1016/J.WASMAN.2013.03.004","","2015-01-27T00:00:00Z","22300365","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/22300365","","Waste Management","6","33"

The last two decades have witnessed the growing importance of demolition and renovation (D and R) works and the growing amount of D and R waste disposed to landfills every day, especially in developed cities like Hong Kong. Quantitative waste prediction is crucial for waste management. It can enable contractors to pinpoint critical waste generation processes and to plan waste control strategies. In addition, waste estimation could also facilitate some government waste management policies, such as the waste disposal charging scheme in Hong Kong. Currently, tools that can accurately and conveniently estimate the amount of waste from construction, renovation, and demolition projects are lacking. In the light of this research gap, this paper presents a building information modeling (BIM) based system that we have developed for estimation and planning of D and R waste. BIM allows multi-disciplinary information to be superimposed within one digital building model. Our system can extract material and volume information through the BIM model and integrate the information for detailed waste estimation and planning. Waste recycling and reuse are also considered in our system. Extracted material information can be provided to recyclers before demolition or renovation to make recycling stage more cooperative and more efficient. Pick-up truck requirements and waste disposal charging fee for different waste facilities will also be predicted through our system. The results could provide alerts to contractors ahead of time at project planning stage.

In the present paper an attempt was made at critically reviewing more than 80 recent publications, in order to harmonize and compare the available results from different studies on hydrogen production from FW and OFMSW through dark fermentation, and derive reliable information about process yield and stability in view of building related predictive models. The review was focused on the effect of factors, recognized as potentially affecting process evolution (including type of substrate and co-substrate and relative ratio, type of inoculum, food/microorganisms [F/M] ratio, applied pre-treatment, reactor configuration, temperature and pH), on the fermentation yield and kinetics. Statistical analysis of literature data from batch experiments was also conducted, showing that the variables affecting the H{sub 2} production yield were ranked in the order: type of co-substrate, type of pre-treatment, operating pH, control of initial pH and fermentation temperature. However, due to the dispersion of data observed in some instances, the ambiguity about the presence of additional hidden variables cannot be resolved. The results from the analysis thus suggest that, for reliable predictive models of fermentative hydrogen production to be derived, a high level of consistency between data is strictly required, claiming for more systematic and comprehensive studies on the subject.","","Available from http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.wasman.2013.02.019","","","","United States","2013-06-15T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: Waste Management; Journal Volume: 33; Journal Issue: 6; Other Information: Copyright (c) 2013 Elsevier Science B.V., Amsterdam, The Netherlands, All rights reserved.; Country of input: International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA)","","Medium: X; Size: page(s) 1345-1361","","","","Journal ID: ISSN 0956-053X; CODEN: WAMAE2; PII: S0956-053X(13)00107-4; TRN: US14R3379006532","10.1016/J.WASMAN.2013.02.019","","2015-01-27T00:00:00Z","22300359","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/22300359","","Waste Management","6","33"
"Solid-State NMR Examination of Alteration Layers on a Nuclear Waste Glasses","Murphy, Kelly A.; Washton, Nancy M.; Ryan, Joseph V.; Pantano, Carlo G.; Mueller, Karl T.; Pacific Northwest National Laboratory (PNNL), Richland, WA (United States). Environmental Molecular Science Lab.]","12 MANAGEMENT OF RADIOACTIVE AND NON-RADIOACTIVE WASTES FROM NUCLEAR FACILITIES; GLASS; CORROSION; GELS; NMR,; hydrated layer; alteration; Environmental Molecular Sciences Laboratory","Solid-state NMR is a powerful tool for probing the role and significance of alteration layers in determining the kinetics for the corrosion of nuclear waste glass. NMR methods are used to probe the chemical structure of the alteration layers to elucidate information about their chemical complexity, leading to increased insight into the mechanism of altered layer formation. Two glass compositions were examined in this study: a glass preliminarily designed for nuclear waste immobilization (called AFCI) and a simplified version of this AFCI glass (which we call SA1R). Powdered glasses with controlled and known particles sizes were corroded at 90 °C for periods of one and five months with a surface-area to solution-volume ratio of 100,000 m-1. 1H-29Si CP-CPMG MAS NMR, 1H-27Al CP-MAS NMR, 1H-11B CP-MAS NMR, and 1H-23Na CP-MAS NMR experiments provide isolated structural information about the alteration layers, which differ in structure from that of the pristine glass. Both glasses studied here develop alteration layers composed primarily of [IV]Si species. Aluminum is also retained in the alteration layers, perhaps facilitated by the observed increase in coordination from [IV]Al to [VI]Al, which correlates with a loss of charge balancing cations. 1H-11B CP-MAS NMR observations indicated a retention of boron in hydrated glass layers, which has not been characterized by previous work. For the AFCI glass, secondary phase formation begins during the corrosion times considered here, and these neophases are detected within the alteration layers. We identify precursor phases as crystalline sodium metasilicates. An important finding is that layer thickness depends on the length of the initial alteration stages and varies only with respect to silicon species during the residual rate regime.","Elsevier","","Pacific Northwest National Lab.

This paper investigates the generation properties of polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) during the incineration. Samples were collected from the bottom ash in an open burning slash site, surface soil at the open burning site, bottom ash from a simple incinerator, bottom ash generated from the municipal solid waste (MSW) incinerator used for medical waste disposal, and bottom ash and fly ash from an incinerator exclusively used for medical waste. The species of PAHs were analyzed, and the toxicity equivalency quantities (TEQs) of samples calculated. Analysis results indicate that the content of total PAHs in fly ash was 1.8 × 10{sup 3} times higher than that in bottom ash, and that the strongly carcinogenic PAHs with four or more rings accumulated sensitively in fly ash. The test results of samples gathered from open burning site demonstrate that Acenaphthylene (ACY), Acenaphthene (ACE), Fluorene (FLU), Phenanthrene (PHE), Anthracene (ANT) and other PAHs were inclined to migrate into surrounding environment along air and surface watershed corridors, while 4- to 6-ring PAHs accumulated more likely in soil. Being consistent with other studies, it has also been confirmed that increases in both free oxygen molecules and combustion temperatures could promote the decomposition of polycyclic PAHs. In addition, without the influence of combustion conditions, there is a positive correlation between total PCDD/Fs and total PAHs, although no such relationship has been found for TEQ.","","Available from http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.wasman.2013.01.011","","","","United States","2013-05-15T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: Waste Management; Journal Volume: 33; Journal Issue: 5; Other Information: Copyright (c) 2013 Elsevier Science B.V., Amsterdam, The Netherlands, All rights reserved.; Country of input: International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA)","","Medium: X; Size: page(s) 1165-1173","","","","Journal ID: ISSN 0956-053X; CODEN: WAMAE2; PII: S0956-053X(13)00041-X; TRN: US14R3371010767","10.1016/J.WASMAN.2013.01.011","","2015-01-30T00:00:00Z","22304595","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/22304595","","Waste Management","5","33"

Life-cycle emissions, cost, fuel and energy consumption were evaluated for a wide range of fossil and bio-fuel technologies. Emission factors were calculated for a typical waste collection driving cycle as well as constant speed. In brief, natural gas waste collection vehicles (compressed and liquid) fueled with North-American natural gas had 6–10% higher well-to-wheel (WTW) greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions relative to diesel-fueled vehicles; however the pump-to-wheel (PTW) GHG emissions of natural gas waste collection vehicles averaged 6% less than diesel-fueled vehicles. Landfill gas had about 80% lower WTW GHG emissions relative to diesel. Biodiesel waste collection vehicles had between 12% and 75% lower WTW GHG emissions relative to diesel depending on the fuel source and the blend. In 2011, natural gas waste collection vehicles had the lowest fuel cost per collection vehicle kilometer travel. Finally, the actual driving cycle of waste collection vehicles consists of repetitive stops and starts during waste collection; this generates more emissions than constant speed driving.","","Available from http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.wasman.2012.12.021","","","","United States","2013-05-15T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: Waste Management; Journal Volume: 33; Journal Issue: 5; Other Information: Copyright (c) 2013 Elsevier Science B.V., Amsterdam, The Netherlands, All rights reserved.; Country of input: International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA)","","Medium: X; Size: page(s) 1079-1089","","","","Journal ID: ISSN 0956-053X; CODEN: WAMAE2; PII: S0956-053X(12)00587-9; TRN: US14R3366006521","10.1016/J.WASMAN.2012.12.021","","2015-01-27T00:00:00Z","22300348","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/22300348","","Waste Management","5","33"

Following its use in different fields, this MW irradiation method has proved to be more appropriate in the field of environmental research. In this paper, we focused on the effects of MW irradiation at different intensities on solubilization, biodegradation and anaerobic digestion of sludge from the dairy sludge. The changes in the soluble fractions of the organic matter, the biogas yield, the methane content in the biogas were used as control parameters for evaluating the efficiency of the MW pretreatment. Additionally, the energetic efficiency was also examined. In terms of an energetic aspect, the most economical pretreatment of sludge was at 70% intensity for 12 min irradiation time. At this, COD solubilization, SS reduction and biogas production were found to be 18.6%, 14% and 35% higher than the control, respectively. Not only the increase in biogas production was investigated, excluding protein and carbohydrate hydrolysis was also performed successfully by this microwave pretreatment even at low irradiation energy input. Also, experiments were carried out in semi continuous anaerobic digesters, with 3.5 L working volume.

The study collected and processed data from several moving grate conventional incinerators and high-temperature shaft gasifiers with direct melting, which are in operation worldwide.

The patterns of key elements, such as carbon, chloride and heavy metals, in the different solid and gaseous output streams of the two compared processes have been then defined. The combination of partitioning coefficients with the mass balances on atomic species and results of mineralogical characterization from recent literatures was used to estimate a composition of bottom ashes and slags from the two types of waste-to-energy technologies.

For example, major elements present in SSA are the same of major elements of cement. Hydraulic properties of SSA are quite the same of cement ones. They may therefore be used to substitute part of cement in concrete or other cementitious materials, provided that technical prescriptions are satisfied and that environmental risks are not significantly increased. The objective of the present study was to determine the appropriate substitution ratios to satisfy both technical and environmental criteria. In a first step, the elemental composition and particle size distribution of the ashes were measured. Then the ashes were used along with Portland cement and sand at different ratios of substitution to produce mortar and concrete which were cured for up to 90 days into parallelepipedic or cylindrical monoliths. The mechanical properties of the monoliths were measured using standard procedures for flexural and compressive strengths, and compared to blanks containing no ashes. The environmental criteria were assessed using leaching tests conducted according to standard protocols both on the ashes and the monoliths, and compared to the blanks. Results showed that the characteristics of the ashes ranged between those of cement and sand because of their larger particle size and higher content in SiO{sub 2} as compared to cement. The monoliths made with the highest substitution ratios exhibited a significant decrease in flexural and compressive strengths. However, when the ashes were used in partial substitution of cement at appropriate ratios, the concrete monoliths exhibited similar compressive strengths as the blank samples. The most appropriate ratios were found to be 10% substitution of cement and 2% substitution of sand. The leaching tests conducted on the ashes in their powdery form revealed that amongst the potential contaminants analyzed only Mo and Se were leached at concentrations above the threshold limits considered. The leaching tests conducted on concrete monoliths showed however that none of the contaminants monitored, including Mo and Se, were leached above the limits. In addition, whether concrete recipe incorporated ashes or not, similar concentrations were measured for each potential contaminant in the leachates. This result indicated that mixing ash with cement and sand to produce mortar or concrete induced a stabilization of Mo and Se and thereby constituted in itself a good treatment of the ashes.","","Available from http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.wasman.2013.01.004","","","","United States","2013-05-15T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: Waste Management; Journal Volume: 33; Journal Issue: 5; Other Information: Copyright (c) 2013 Elsevier Science B.V., Amsterdam, The Netherlands, All rights reserved.; Country of input: International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA)","","Medium: X; Size: page(s) 1268-1275","","","","Journal ID: ISSN 0956-053X; CODEN: WAMAE2; PII: S0956-053X(13)00012-3; TRN: US14R3373006527","10.1016/J.WASMAN.2013.01.004","","2015-01-27T00:00:00Z","22300354","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/22300354","","Waste Management","5","33"

This pretreatment and separation is performed to remove impurities, however also some of the organic material is removed. The possibility of realising the methane potential of the dry fraction through batch-wise dry anaerobic digestion was investigated. The anaerobic digestion technique used was a two-stage process consisting of a static leach bed reactor and a methane reactor. Treatment of the dry fraction alone and in a mixture with structural material was tested to investigate the effect on the porosity of the leach bed. A tracer experiment was carried out to investigate the liquid flow through the leach beds, and this method proved useful in demonstrating a more homogenous flow through the leach bed when structural material was added. Addition of structural material to the dry fraction was needed to achieve a functional digestion process. A methane yield of 98 m{sup 3}/ton was obtained from the dry fraction mixed with structural material after 76 days of digestion. This was in the same range as obtained in the laboratory scale biochemical methane potential test, showing that it was possible to extract the organic content in the dry fraction in this type of dry digestion system for the production of methane.","","Available from http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.wasman.2013.01.034","","","","United States","2013-05-15T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: Waste Management; Journal Volume: 33; Journal Issue: 5; Other Information: Copyright (c) 2013 Elsevier Science B.V., Amsterdam, The Netherlands, All rights reserved.; Country of input: International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA)","","Medium: X; Size: page(s) 1282-1289","","","","Journal ID: ISSN 0956-053X; CODEN: WAMAE2; PII: S0956-053X(13)00064-0; TRN: US14R3375006528","10.1016/J.WASMAN.2013.01.034","","2015-01-27T00:00:00Z","22300355","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/22300355","","Waste Management","5","33"

Most models are mainly developed within three decision support frameworks, which are the life-cycle assessment, the cost–benefit analysis and the multi-criteria decision-making. These frameworks are reviewed and their strengths and weaknesses as well as their critical issues are analyzed, while their possible combinations and extensions are also discussed. Furthermore, the paper presents how cooperative and non-cooperative game-theoretic approaches can be used for the purpose of modeling and analyzing decision-making in situations with multiple stakeholders. Specifically, since a waste management model is sustainable when considering not only environmental and economic but also social aspects, the waste management bargaining game is introduced as a specific decision support framework in which future models can be developed.","","Available from http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.wasman.2013.01.017","","","","United States","2013-05-15T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: Waste Management; Journal Volume: 33; Journal Issue: 5; Other Information: Copyright (c) 2013 Elsevier Science B.V., Amsterdam, The Netherlands, All rights reserved.; Country of input: International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA)","","Medium: X; Size: page(s) 1290-1301","","","","Journal ID: ISSN 0956-053X; CODEN: WAMAE2; PII: S0956-053X(13)00047-0; TRN: US14R3376006529","10.1016/J.WASMAN.2013.01.017","","2015-01-27T00:00:00Z","22300356","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/22300356","","Waste Management","5","33"

To examine these policy options, trends in solid waste quantities and associated GHG emissions are derived. Three alternative policy scenarios are evaluated in terms of effectiveness, technology, and economics and conclusions posited regarding optimal strategies for Brazil to implement. These scenarios are been building on the guidelines for national inventories of GHG emissions (IPCC, 2006) and adapted to Brazilian states and municipalities’ boundaries. Based on the results, it is possible to say that the potential revenue from products of solid waste management is more than sufficient to transform the current scenario in this country into one of financial and environmental gains, where the negative impacts of climate change have created a huge opportunity to expand infrastructure for waste management.","","Available from http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.wasman.2013.01.024","","","","United States","2013-05-15T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: Waste Management; Journal Volume: 33; Journal Issue: 5; Other Information: Copyright (c) 2013 Elsevier Science B.V., Amsterdam, The Netherlands, All rights reserved.; Country of input: International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA)","","Medium: X; Size: page(s) 1302-1312","","","","Journal ID: ISSN 0956-053X; CODEN: WAMAE2; PII: S0956-053X(13)00054-8; TRN: US14R3377006530","10.1016/J.WASMAN.2013.01.024","","2015-01-27T00:00:00Z","22300357","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/22300357","","Waste Management","5","33"

The process of separation of food waste at its generation source is identified as effective means in reducing the amount food waste sent to landfill and can be reused as feedstock to downstream treatment processes namely composting or anaerobic digestion. However, these efforts will only succeed with positive attitudes and highly participations rate by the public towards the scheme. Thus, the social survey (using questionnaires) to analyse public’s view and influencing factors towards participation in source separation of food waste in households based on the theory of planned behaviour technique (TPB) was performed in June and July 2011 among selected staff in Universiti Putra Malaysia, Serdang, Selangor. The survey demonstrates that the public has positive intention in participating provided the opportunities, facilities and knowledge on waste separation at source are adequately prepared by the respective local authorities. Furthermore, good moral values and situational factors such as storage convenience and collection times are also encouraged public’s involvement and consequently, the participations rate. The findings from this study may provide useful indicator to the waste management authorities in Malaysia in identifying mechanisms for future development and implementation of food waste source separation activities in household programmes and communication campaign which advocate the use of these programmes.","","Available from http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.wasman.2012.09.019","","","","United States","2013-05-15T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: Waste Management; Journal Volume: 33; Journal Issue: 5; Other Information: Copyright (c) 2012 Elsevier Science B.V., Amsterdam, The Netherlands, All rights reserved.; Country of input: International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA)","","Medium: X; Size: page(s) 1276-1281","","","","Journal ID: ISSN 0956-053X; CODEN: WAMAE2; PII: S0956-053X(12)00458-8; TRN: US14R3374010768","10.1016/J.WASMAN.2012.09.019","","2015-01-30T00:00:00Z","22304596","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/22304596","","Waste Management","5","33"

Since then, this usage has grown considerably, also as a result of changes in habits. The environmental impact as a result of the water production chain is very significant; it would be considered, for example, the use of plastic bottles, the consumption of oil in the production of the bottles, the emission of air from the vehicles that transport the bottles, non-recycled plastic packaging, etc. In this study, considering the comparison between two situations, use of bottled water and use of water kiosk (WK), an environmental and economic impact evaluation has been done. The study considered the production of a WK in a town with 9000 inhabitants, which supplies controlled, still and sparkling water, with an organoleptic quality higher than tap water coming from the aqueduct. In particular, taking into consideration the environmental aspects, specific attention was paid both to CO{sub 2} emissions and PET bottle waste reduction. The economic impact evaluation was carried out from the consumer’s point of view. In order to provide a supply service that was economically sustainable, a calculation was done with the aim of determining a specific fee for the supplied water. Moreover, a comparison has been made between quality parameters achieved with the analysis of water from aqueducts with the limits established in the Italian legislation and the parameters of several Italian water brands. The study has the aim at considering the opportunity to follow a different people’s habits, closer to the concept of sustainability, reducing the environmental charge related to the realization, transport and consumption of plastic water bottles without significant reduction of the quality of the service and with convenient and interesting economic implications. In fact the results of the study show that the alternative of WKs is more efficient in economic and environmental terms respect to the use of bottled water.","","Available from http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.wasman.2013.01.014","","","","United States","2013-05-15T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: Waste Management; Journal Volume: 33; Journal Issue: 5; Other Information: Copyright (c) 2013 Elsevier Science B.V., Amsterdam, The Netherlands, All rights reserved.; Country of input: International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA)","","Medium: X; Size: page(s) 1057-1063","","","","Journal ID: ISSN 0956-053X; CODEN: WAMAE2; PII: S0956-053X(13)00044-5; TRN: US14R3365006520","10.1016/J.WASMAN.2013.01.014","","2015-01-27T00:00:00Z","22300347","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/22300347","","Waste Management","5","33"

In this study, we used differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) to investigate cold-cap reactions in a high-alumina high-level waste melter feed. To separate the reaction heat from both sensible heat and experimental instability, we employed the run/rerun method, which enabled us to define the degree of conversion based on the reaction heat and to estimate the heat capacity of the reacting feed. Assuming that the reactions are nearly independent and can be approximated by the nth order kinetics, we obtained the kinetic parameters using the Kissinger method combined with least squares analysis. The resulting mathematical simulation of the cold-cap reactions provides a key element for the development of an advanced cold-cap model.","Elsevier","","Pacific Northwest National Lab.

The former, such as the Kd simplification of adsorption, has been widely employed by practitioners, while the latter has been mainly used in scientific communities for elucidating mechanisms of biogeochemical transport processes. It is believed that innovative mechanistic-based models could serve as protocols for environmental remediation as well. This paper reviews the development of a mechanistically coupled fluid flow, thermal transport, hydrologic transport, and reactive biogeochemical model and example-applications to environmental remediation problems. Theoretical bases are sufficiently described. Four example problems previously carried out are used to demonstrate how numerical experimentation can be used to evaluate the feasibility of different remediation approaches. The first one involved the application of a 56-species uranium tailing problem to the Melton Branch Subwatershed at Oak Ridge National Laboratory (ORNL) using the parallel version of the model. Simulations were made to demonstrate the potential mobilization of uranium and other chelating agents in the proposed waste disposal site. The second problem simulated laboratory-scale system to investigate the role of natural attenuation in potential off-site migration of uranium from uranium mill tailings after restoration. It showed inadequacy of using a single Kd even for a homogeneous medium. The third example simulated laboratory experiments involving extremely high concentrations of uranium, technetium, aluminum, nitrate, and toxic metals (e.g.,Ni, Cr, Co).The fourth example modeled microbially-mediated immobilization of uranium in an unconfined aquifer using acetate amendment in a field-scale experiment. The purposes of these modeling studies were to simulate various mechanisms of mobilization and immobilization of radioactive wastes and to illustrate how to apply reactive transport models for environmental remediation.The second problem simulated laboratory-scale system to investigate the role of natural attenuation in potential off-site migration of uranium from uranium mill tailings after restoration.

The French and German waste management agencies have indeed defined acceptability limits concerning these elements in view of their projected geological repositories. A first measurement campaign was performed in the new Prompt Gamma Neutron Activation Analysis (PGNAA) facility called MEDINA, at FZJ, to assess the capture gamma-ray signatures of some elements of interest in large samples up to waste drums with a volume of 200 liter. MEDINA is the acronym for Multi Element Detection based on Instrumental Neutron Activation. This paper presents MCNP calculations of the MEDINA facility and quantitative comparison between measurement and simulation. Passive gamma-ray spectra acquired with a high purity germanium detector and calibration sources are used to qualify the numerical model of the crystal. Active PGNAA spectra of a sodium chloride sample measured with MEDINA then allow for qualifying the global numerical model of the measurement cell. Chlorine indeed constitutes a usual reference with reliable capture gamma-ray production data. The goal is to characterize the entire simulation protocol (geometrical model, nuclear data, and postprocessing tools) which will be used for current measurement interpretation, extrapolation of the performances to other types of waste packages or other applications, as well as for the study of future PGNAA facilities.","","","","","","United States","2013-04-19T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","Conference","Journal Name: AIP Conference Proceedings; Journal Volume: 1525; Journal Issue: 1; Conference: 22. international conference on application of accelerators in research and industry, Ft.

The optimization of waste collection, through source separation, is compulsory where a landfill based management must be overcome. In this paper, a few aspects related to the implementation of a Web-GIS based system are analyzed. This approach is critically analyzed referring to the experience of two Italian case studies and two additional extra-European case studies. The first case is one of the best examples of selective collection optimization in Italy. The obtained efficiency is very high: 80% of waste is source separated for recycling purposes. In the second reference case, the local administration is going to be faced with the optimization of waste collection through Web-GIS oriented technologies for the first time. The starting scenario is far from an optimized management of municipal solid waste. The last two case studies concern pilot experiences in China and Malaysia. Each step of the Web-GIS oriented strategy is comparatively discussed referring to typical scenarios of developed and transient economies.

BA samples were taken at different steps of treatment (fresh, 4 weeks and 12 weeks aged) and then characterised for their chemical and mineralogical composition and for volume stability by means of the mineralogical test method (M HMVA-StB), which is part of the German quality control system for using aggregates in road construction (TL Gestein-StB 04). Changes of mineralogical composition with the proceeding of the weathering treatment were also monitored by leaching tests. At the end of the 12 weeks of treatment, almost all the considered samples resulted to be usable without restrictions in road construction with reference to the test parameter volume stability.","","Available from http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.wasman.2012.12.005","","","","United States","2013-04-15T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: Waste Management; Journal Volume: 33; Journal Issue: 4; Other Information: Copyright (c) 2012 Elsevier Science B.V., Amsterdam, The Netherlands, All rights reserved.; Country of input: International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA)","","Medium: X; Size: page(s) 850-857","","","","Journal ID: ISSN 0956-053X; CODEN: WAMAE2; PII: S0956-053X(12)00550-8; TRN: US14R3351010753","10.1016/J.WASMAN.2012.12.005","","2015-01-30T00:00:00Z","22304581","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/22304581","","Waste Management","4","33"

The tests were run to monitor the effects produced by aerobic conditions at different temperatures on waste sampled at different depths in the landfill, with focus on the carbon and nitrogen conversion during aeration. Temperatures ranging from 35 to 45 °C were chosen, in order to evaluate possible inhibition of biodegradation processes (namely nitrification) at 45 °C in the landfill. The results obtained showed positive effects of the aeration on leachate quality and a significant reduction of waste biodegradability. Although a delay of biodegradation processes was observed in the reactor run at 45 °C, biodegradation rates increased after 2 months of aeration, providing very low values of the relevant parameters (as in the other aerated reactors) by the end of the study. Mass balances were carried out for TOC and N-NH{sub 4}{sup +}; the findings obtained were encouraging and provided evidence of the effectiveness of carbon and nitrogen conversion processes in the aerated landfill simulation reactors.","","Available from http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.wasman.2012.11.014","","","","United States","2013-04-15T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: Waste Management; Journal Volume: 33; Journal Issue: 4; Other Information: Copyright (c) 2012 Elsevier Science B.V., Amsterdam, The Netherlands, All rights reserved.; Country of input: International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA)","","Medium: X; Size: page(s) 871-880","","","","Journal ID: ISSN 0956-053X; CODEN: WAMAE2; PII: S0956-053X(12)00537-5; TRN: US14R3353010755","10.1016/J.WASMAN.2012.11.014","","2015-01-30T00:00:00Z","22304583","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/22304583","","Waste Management","4","33"
"Behavior of an MBT waste in monotonic triaxial shear tests","Bhandari, Athma Ram, E-mail: athma.bhandari@beg.utexas.edu; Powrie, William","54 ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCES; 12 MANAGEMENT OF RADIOACTIVE WASTES, AND NON-RADIOACTIVE WASTES FROM NUCLEAR FACILITIES; BIODEGRADATION; COMPRESSIBILITY; DENSITY; GREENHOUSE GASES; IMAGE PROCESSING; LEGISLATION; MUNICIPAL WASTES; SANITARY LANDFILLS; SOLID WASTES; STRESSES; WASTE PROCESSING","Highlights: ► We studied the stress–strain–strength characteristics of an MBT waste. ► Rate of mobilization of strength with strain depends on initial density. ► Image analysis technique was used to determine whole-specimen displacement fields. ► Initial mode of deformation of a loose specimen is one-dimensional compression. ► Reinforcing elements enhance the resistance to lateral and volumetric deformation. - Abstract: Legislation in some parts of the world now requires municipal solid waste (MSW) to be processed prior to landfilling to reduce its biodegradability and hence its polluting potential through leachate and fugitive emission of greenhouse gases. This pre-processing may be achieved through what is generically termed mechanical–biological-treatment (MBT). One of the major concerns relating to MBT wastes is that the strength of the material may be less than for raw MSW, owing to the removal of sheet, stick and string-like reinforcing elements during processing. Also, the gradual increase in mobilized strength over strains of 30% or so commonly associated with unprocessed municipal solid waste may not occur with treated wastes. This paper describes a series of triaxial tests carried out to investigate the stress–strain–strength characteristics of an MBT waste, using a novel digital image analysis technique for the determination of detailed displacement fields over the whole specimen. New insights gained into the mechanical behavior of MBT waste include the effect of density on the stress–strain response, the initial 1-D compression of lightly consolidated specimens, and the likely reinforcing effect of small sheet like particles remaining in the waste.","","Available from http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.wasman.2012.11.009","","","","United States","2013-04-15T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: Waste Management; Journal Volume: 33; Journal Issue: 4; Other Information: Copyright (c) 2012 Elsevier Science B.V., Amsterdam, The Netherlands, All rights reserved.; Country of input: International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA)","","Medium: X; Size: page(s) 881-891","","","","Journal ID: ISSN 0956-053X; CODEN: WAMAE2; PII: S0956-053X(12)00532-6; TRN: US14R3354010756","10.1016/J.WASMAN.2012.11.009","","2015-01-30T00:00:00Z","22304584","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/22304584","","Waste Management","4","33"

A mathematical formulation based on the cost benefit analysis concept is herein analytically described in order to determine the parts and/or components of an obsolete product that should be either non-destructively recovered for reuse or be recycled. The framework optimally determines the depth of disassembly for a given product, taking into account economic considerations. On this basis, it embeds all relevant cost elements to be included in the decision-making process, such as recovered materials and (depreciated) parts/components, labor costs, energy consumption, equipment depreciation, quality control and warehousing. This tool can be part of the strategic decision-making process in order to maximize profitability or minimize end-of-life management costs. A case study to demonstrate the models’ applicability is presented for a typical electronic product in terms of structure and material composition. Taking into account the market values of the pilot product’s components, the manual disassembly is proven profitable with the marginal revenues from recovered reusable materials to be estimated at 2.93–23.06 €, depending on the level of disassembly.","","Available from http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.wasman.2012.12.024","","","","United States","2013-04-15T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: Waste Management; Journal Volume: 33; Journal Issue: 4; Other Information: Copyright (c) 2013 Elsevier Science B.V., Amsterdam, The Netherlands, All rights reserved.; Country of input: International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA)","","Medium: X; Size: page(s) 948-956","","","","Journal ID: ISSN 0956-053X; CODEN: WAMAE2; PII: S0956-053X(13)00004-4; TRN: US14R3358010760","10.1016/J.WASMAN.2012.12.024","","2015-01-30T00:00:00Z","22304588","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/22304588","","Waste Management","4","33"

In this study, the VSCs generated from composting of 15–80 mm municipal solid waste (T0), kitchen waste (T1) and kitchen waste mixed dry cornstalks (T2) were measured in 60 L reactors with forced aeration for a period of 30 days. The VSCs detected in all treatments were hydrogen sulfide (H{sub 2}S), methyl mercaptan (MM), dimethyl sulfide (DMS), carbon bisulfide (CS{sub 2}) and dimethyl disulfide (DMDS). Over 90% of the VSCs emissions occurred during the first 15 days, and reached their peak values at days 4–7. The emission profiles of five VSCs species were significantly correlated with internal materials temperature and outlet O{sub 2} concentration (p < 0.05). Total emissions of the VSCs were 216.1, 379.3 and 126.0 mg kg{sup −1} (dry matter) for T0, T1 and T2, respectively. Among the five VSCs, H{sub 2}S was the most abundant compound with 39.0–43.0% of total VSCs released. Composting of kitchen waste from separate collection posed a negative influence on the VSC and leachate production because of its high moisture content. An addition of dry cornstalks at a mixing ratio of 4:1 (wet weight) could significantly reduce the VSCs emissions and avoid leachate. Compared to pure kitchen waste, VSCs were reduced 66.8%.","","Available from http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.wasman.2012.11.008","","","","United States","2013-04-15T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: Waste Management; Journal Volume: 33; Journal Issue: 4; Other Information: Copyright (c) 2012 Elsevier Science B.V., Amsterdam, The Netherlands, All rights reserved.; Country of input: International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA)","","Medium: X; Size: page(s) 957-963","","","","Journal ID: ISSN 0956-053X; CODEN: WAMAE2; PII: S0956-053X(12)00531-4; TRN: US14R3359010761","10.1016/J.WASMAN.2012.11.008","","2015-01-30T00:00:00Z","22304589","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/22304589","","Waste Management","4","33"

Measurements consisted of volatile organic compounds (VOCs) and bioaerosols including microbes, dust and endotoxins. The most abundant compounds in both of the plants were aliphatic and aromatic hydrocarbons, esters of carboxylic acids, ketones and terpenes. In terms of odour generation, the most important emissions were acetic acid, 2,3-butanedione, ethyl acetate, alpha-pinene and limonene due to their low threshold odour concentrations. At the optic waste separation plant, limonene occurred at the highest concentration of all single compounds of identified VOCs. The concentration of any single volatile organic compound did not exceed the occupational exposure limit (OEL) concentration. However, 2,3-butanedione as a health risk compound is discussed based on recent scientific findings linking it to lung disease. Microbe and dust concentrations were low at the waste transferring plant. Only endotoxin concentrations may cause health problems; the average concentration inside the plant was 425 EU/m{sup 3} which clearly exceeded the threshold value of 90 EU/m{sup 3}. In the wheel loader cabin the endotoxin concentrations were below 1 EU/m{sup 3}. High microbial and endotoxin concentrations were measured in the processing hall at the optic waste separation plant. The average concentration of endotoxins was found to be 10,980 EU/m{sup 3}, a concentration which may cause health risks. Concentrations of viable fungi were quite high in few measurements in the control room. The most problematic factor was endotoxins whose average measured concentrations was 4853 EU/m{sup 3}.","","Available from http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.wasman.2012.11.010","","","","United States","2013-04-15T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: Waste Management; Journal Volume: 33; Journal Issue: 4; Other Information: Copyright (c) 2012 Elsevier Science B.V., Amsterdam, The Netherlands, All rights reserved.; Country of input: International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA)","","Medium: X; Size: page(s) 964-973","","","","Journal ID: ISSN 0956-053X; CODEN: WAMAE2; PII: S0956-053X(12)00533-8; TRN: US14R3360010762","10.1016/J.WASMAN.2012.11.010","","2015-01-30T00:00:00Z","22304590","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/22304590","","Waste Management","4","33"

The aim of this study was to verify the effects of the closure of solid waste treatment and disposal facilities (two landfills and one RDF production plant) on public perception of odour and environmental pollution. The study took place in four villages in Southern Italy. Identical questionnaires were administered to residents during 2003 and after the closure of the facilities occurred in 2008. The residents’ perception of odour nuisance considerably diminished between 2003 and 2009 for the nearest villages, with odour perception showing an association with distance from the facilities. Post closure, residents had difficulty in identifying the type of smell due to the decrease in odour level. During both surveys, older residents reported most concern about the potentially adverse health impacts of long-term exposure to odours from MSW facilities. However, although awareness of MSW facilities and concern about potentially adverse health impacts varied according to the characteristics of residents in 2003, substantial media coverage produced an equalisation effect and increased knowledge about the type of facilities and how they operated. It is possible that residents of the village nearest to the facilities reported lower awareness of and concern about odour and environmental pollution because the municipality received economic compensation for their presence.","","Available from http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.wasman.2012.12.016","","","","United States","2013-04-15T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: Waste Management; Journal Volume: 33; Journal Issue: 4; Other Information: Copyright (c) 2012 Elsevier Science B.V., Amsterdam, The Netherlands, All rights reserved.; Country of input: International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA)","","Medium: X; Size: page(s) 974-987","","","","Journal ID: ISSN 0956-053X; CODEN: WAMAE2; PII: S0956-053X(12)00581-8; TRN: US14R3361010763","10.1016/J.WASMAN.2012.12.016","","2015-01-30T00:00:00Z","22304591","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/22304591","","Waste Management","4","33"

The health and environmental implications associated with SWM are mounting in urgency, particularly in the context of developing countries. While systems analyses largely targeting well-defined, engineered systems have been used to help SWM agencies in industrialized countries since the 1960s, collection and removal dominate the SWM sector in developing countries. This review contrasts the history and current paradigms of SWM practices and policies in industrialized countries with the current challenges and complexities faced in developing country SWM. In industrialized countries, public health, environment, resource scarcity, climate change, and public awareness and participation have acted as SWM drivers towards the current paradigm of integrated SWM. However, urbanization, inequality, and economic growth; cultural and socio-economic aspects; policy, governance, and institutional issues; and international influences have complicated SWM in developing countries. This has limited the applicability of approaches that were successful along the SWM development trajectories of industrialized countries. This review demonstrates the importance of founding new SWM approaches for developing country contexts in post-normal science and complex, adaptive systems thinking.","","Available from http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.wasman.2012.12.023","","","","United States","2013-04-15T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: Waste Management; Journal Volume: 33; Journal Issue: 4; Other Information: Copyright (c) 2013 Elsevier Science B.V., Amsterdam, The Netherlands, All rights reserved.; Country of input: International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA)","","Medium: X; Size: page(s) 988-1003","","","","Journal ID: ISSN 0956-053X; CODEN: WAMAE2; PII: S0956-053X(13)00003-2; TRN: US14R3362010764","10.1016/J.WASMAN.2012.12.023","","2015-01-30T00:00:00Z","22304592","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/22304592","","Waste Management","4","33"

However, it is estimated that in the city of Rio de Janeiro there are around five thousand waste-pickers working in poor conditions, with lack of physical infrastructure and training, but contributing significantly by diverting solid waste from landfills. According to the Sustainable Development Indicators (IBGE, 2010a,b) in Brazil, recycling rates hover between 45% and 55%. In the municipality of Rio de Janeiro, only 1% of the waste produced is collected selectively by the government (COMLURB, 2010), demonstrating that recycling is mainly performed by waste-pickers. Furthermore, since the recycling market is an oligopsony that requires economies of scale to negotiate directly with industries, the idea of working in networks of cooperatives meets the demands for joint marketing of recyclable materials. Thus, this work presents a method for creating and structuring a network of recycling cooperatives, with prior training for working in networks, so that the expected synergies and joint efforts can lead to concrete results. We intend to demonstrate that it is first essential to strengthen the waste-pickers’ cooperatives in terms of infrastructure, governance and training so that solid waste management can be environmentally, socially and economically sustainable in the city of Rio de Janeiro.","","Available from http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.wasman.2012.09.025","","","","United States","2013-04-15T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: Waste Management; Journal Volume: 33; Journal Issue: 4; Other Information: Copyright (c) 2012 Elsevier Science B.V., Amsterdam, The Netherlands, All rights reserved.; Country of input: International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA)","","Medium: X; Size: page(s) 1004-1012","","","","Journal ID: ISSN 0956-053X; CODEN: WAMAE2; PII: S0956-053X(12)00549-1; TRN: US14R3363010765","10.1016/J.WASMAN.2012.09.025","","2015-01-30T00:00:00Z","22304593","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/22304593","","Waste Management","4","33"

However, these factors have been calculated for developed countries of the Northern Hemisphere and are lacking for developing countries. This paper shows how such factors have been developed for the collection, transport and landfilling of municipal waste in South Africa. As such it presents a model on how international results and methodology can be adapted and used to calculate country-specific GHG emission factors from waste. For the collection and transport of municipal waste in South Africa, the average diesel consumption is around 5 dm{sup 3} (litres) per tonne of wet waste and the associated GHG emissions are about 15 kg CO{sub 2} equivalents (CO{sub 2} e). Depending on the type of landfill, the GHG emissions from the landfilling of waste have been calculated to range from −145 to 1016 kg CO{sub 2} e per tonne of wet waste, when taking into account carbon storage, and from 441 to 2532 kg CO{sub 2} e per tonne of wet waste, when carbon storage is left out. The highest emission factor per unit of wet waste is for landfill sites without landfill gas collection and these are the dominant waste disposal facilities in South Africa. However, cash strapped municipalities in Africa and the developing world will not be able to significantly upgrade these sites and reduce their GHG burdens if there is no equivalent replacement of the Clean Development Mechanism (CDM) resulting from the Kyoto agreement. Other low cost avenues need to be investigated to suit local conditions, in particular landfill covers which enhance methane oxidation.","","Available from http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.wasman.2012.12.011","","","","United States","2013-04-15T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: Waste Management; Journal Volume: 33; Journal Issue: 4; Other Information: Copyright (c) 2012 Elsevier Science B.V., Amsterdam, The Netherlands, All rights reserved.; Country of input: International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA)","","Medium: X; Size: page(s) 1013-1026","","","","Journal ID: ISSN 0956-053X; CODEN: WAMAE2; PII: S0956-053X(12)00556-9; TRN: US14R3364010766","10.1016/J.WASMAN.2012.12.011","","2015-01-30T00:00:00Z","22304594","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/22304594","","Waste Management","4","33"

Many facilities have been constructed at the SRS over the years to process, stabilize and/or store radioactive waste and related materials. The primary materials of construction used in such facilities are inorganic (metals, concrete), but polymeric materials are inevitably used in various applications. The effects of aging, radiation, chemicals, heat and other environmental variables must therefore be understood to maximize service life of polymeric components. In particular, the potential for dose rate effects and synergistic effects on polymeric materials in multivariable environments can complicate compatibility reviews and life predictions. The selection and performance of polymeric materials in radioactive waste processing systems at the SRS are discussed.","Institute of Nuclear Materials Management","","Savannah River Site (SRS), Aiken, SC (United States)","USDOE","","United States","2013-04-15T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: Journal of Nuclear Materials Management; Journal Volume: 2013","","Medium: ED","","SRNL-STI-2013-00224","DE-AC09-08SR22470","Journal ID: ISSN 0893-6188","","","2017-04-18T00:00:00Z","1096418","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/1096418","https://www.osti.gov/servlets/purl/1096418","Journal of Nuclear Materials Management","","2013"
"Setting and stiffening of cementitious components in Cast Stone waste form for disposal of secondary wastes from the Hanford waste treatment and immobilization plant","Chung, Chul-Woo; Chun, Jaehun; Um, Wooyong; Sundaram, S.

However, no study has been performed to understand the flow and stiffening behavior, which is essential to ensure proper workability and is important to safety in a nuclear waste field-scale application. X-ray diffraction, rheology, and ultrasonic wave reflection methods were used to understand the specific phase formation and stiffening of Cast Stone. Our results showed a good correlation between rheological properties of the fresh mixture and phase formation in Cast Stone. Secondary gypsum formation was observed with low concentration simulants, and the formation of gypsum was suppressed in high concentration simulants. A threshold concentration for the drastic change in stiffening was found at 1.56 M Na concentration. It was found that the stiffening of Cast Stone was strongly dependent on the concentration of simulant. Highlights: • A combination of XRD, UWR, and rheology gives a better understanding of Cast Stone. • Stiffening of Cast Stone was strongly dependent on the concentration of simulant. • A drastic change in stiffening of Cast Stone was found at 1.56 M Na concentration.","","Available from http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.cemconres.2013.01.003","","","","United States","2013-04-01T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: Cement and Concrete Research; Journal Volume: 46; Other Information: Copyright (c) 2013 Elsevier Science B.V., Amsterdam, The Netherlands, All rights reserved.; Country of input: International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA)","","Medium: X; Size: page(s) 14-22","","","","Journal ID: ISSN 0008-8846; CODEN: CCNRAI; PII: S0008-8846(13)00010-0; TRN: US15R0287029337","10.1016/J.CEMCONRES.2013.01.003","","2015-05-05T00:00:00Z","22323128","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/22323128","","Cement and Concrete Research","","46"

Seven recycling, recovery and disposal options were considered by the panel who evaluated each option against seven environmental, financial and social criteria. The panel preferred options where the waste was managed on the island with gasification and recycling achieving the highest scores. Exporting the waste to the English mainland for incineration or landfill proved to be the least preferred options. This research has demonstrated that MCDA is an effective way of involving community groups in waste management decision making.","","Available from http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.wasman.2012.06.007","","","","United States","2013-03-15T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","Conference","Journal Name: Waste Management; Journal Volume: 33; Journal Issue: 3; Conference: 1. international symposium on urban mining (SUM), Bergamo (Italy), 21-23 May 2012; Other Information: Copyright (c) 2012 Elsevier Science B.V., Amsterdam, The Netherlands, All rights reserved.; Country of input: International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA)","","Medium: X; Size: page(s) 566-573","","","","Journal ID: ISSN 0956-053X; CODEN: WAMAE2; PII: S0956-053X(12)00277-2; TRN: US15R3130006233","10.1016/J.WASMAN.2012.06.007","","2016-03-04T00:00:00Z","22436790","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/22436790","","Waste Management","3","33"

This study investigated the effects of the chemical composition of incineration fly ash on the metal-separation efficiency of the ash-melting process. Incineration fly ash with different chemical compositions was melted with bottom ash in a lab-scale reactor, and the efficiency with which Pb and Zn were volatilized preventing the volatilization of Fe and Cu was evaluated. In addition, the behavior of these metals was simulated by thermodynamic equilibrium calculations. Depending on the exhaust gas treatment system used in the incinerator, the relationships among Na, K, and Cl concentrations in the incineration fly ash differed, which affected the efficiency of the metal separation. The amounts of Fe and Cu volatilized decreased by the decrease in the molar ratio of Cl to Na and K in the ash, promoting metal separation. The thermodynamic simulation predicted that the chlorination volatilization of Fe and Cu was prevented by the decrease in the molar ratio, as mentioned before. By melting incineration fly ash with the low molar ratio in a non-oxidative atmosphere, most of the Pb and Zn in the ash were volatilized leaving behind Fe and Cu.","","Available from http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.wasman.2012.08.013","","","","United States","2013-03-15T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","Conference","Journal Name: Waste Management; Journal Volume: 33; Journal Issue: 3; Conference: 1. international symposium on urban mining (SUM), Bergamo (Italy), 21-23 May 2012; Other Information: Copyright (c) 2012 Elsevier Science B.V., Amsterdam, The Netherlands, All rights reserved.; Country of input: International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA)","","Medium: X; Size: page(s) 605-614","","","","Journal ID: ISSN 0956-053X; CODEN: WAMAE2; PII: S0956-053X(12)00379-0; TRN: US15R3132006235","10.1016/J.WASMAN.2012.08.013","","2016-03-04T00:00:00Z","22436792","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/22436792","","Waste Management","3","33"

The residual amount of municipal solid waste (MSW) has to be thermally treated before final disposal. Efforts to recover valuable metals from incineration residues have recently increased. However, the resource potential of critical elements in the waste input (sources) and their partitioning into recyclable fractions and residues (fate) is unknown. Therefore, a substance flow analysis (SFA) for 31 elements including precious metals (Au, Ag), platinum metal group elements (Pt, Rh) and rare earth elements (La, Ce, etc.) has been conducted in a solid waste incinerator (SWI) with a state-of-the-art bottom ash treatment according to the Thermo-Re® concept. The SFA allowed the determination of the element partitioning in the SWI, as well as the elemental composition of the MSW by indirect analysis. The results show that the waste-input contains substantial quantities of precious metals, such as 0.4 ± 0.2 mg/kg Au and 5.3 ± 0.7 mg/kg Ag. Many of the valuable substances, such as Au and Ag are enriched in specific outputs (e.g. non-ferrous metal fractions) and are therefore recoverable. As the precious metal content in MSW is expected to rise due to its increasing application in complex consumer products, the results of this study are essential for the improvement of resource recovery in the Thermo-Re® process.","","Available from http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.wasman.2012.09.010","","","","United States","2013-03-15T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","Conference","Journal Name: Waste Management; Journal Volume: 33; Journal Issue: 3; Conference: 1. international symposium on urban mining (SUM), Bergamo (Italy), 21-23 May 2012; Other Information: Copyright (c) 2012 Elsevier Science B.V., Amsterdam, The Netherlands, All rights reserved.; Country of input: International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA)","","Medium: X; Size: page(s) 634-644","","","","Journal ID: ISSN 0956-053X; CODEN: WAMAE2; PII: S0956-053X(12)00422-9; TRN: US15R3134006237","10.1016/J.WASMAN.2012.09.010","","2016-03-04T00:00:00Z","22436794","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/22436794","","Waste Management","3","33"

This study is the first systematic attempt on identifying key TWARC waste disposal outlets and trade practices of key parties involved in Hong Kong. Results from two questionnaire surveys, on local households and private e-waste traders, were used to establish the material flow of household TWARC waste. The study revealed that the majority of obsolete TWARC were sold by households to private e-waste collectors and that the current e-waste collection network is efficient and popular with local households. However, about 65,000 tonnes/yr or 80% of household generated TWARC waste are being exported overseas by private e-waste traders, with some believed to be imported into developing countries where crude recycling methods are practiced. Should Hong Kong establish a formal recycling network with tight regulatory control on imports and exports, the potential risks of current e-waste recycling practices on e-waste recycling workers, local residents and the environment can be greatly reduced.","","Available from http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.wasman.2012.09.007","","","","United States","2013-03-15T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","Conference","Journal Name: Waste Management; Journal Volume: 33; Journal Issue: 3; Conference: 1. international symposium on urban mining (SUM), Bergamo (Italy), 21-23 May 2012; Other Information: Copyright (c) 2012 Elsevier Science B.V., Amsterdam, The Netherlands, All rights reserved.; Country of input: International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA)","","Medium: X; Size: page(s) 714-721","","","","Journal ID: ISSN 0956-053X; CODEN: WAMAE2; PII: S0956-053X(12)00419-9; TRN: US15R3139006241","10.1016/J.WASMAN.2012.09.007","","2016-03-04T00:00:00Z","22436798","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/22436798","","Waste Management","3","33"

The European Commission (EC) directive, 2002/96/EC, on WEEE became law in UK in January 2007 setting targets to recover up to 80% of all WEEE generated. Printed Wire Board (PWB) and/or Printed Circuit Board (PCB) is an important component of WEEE with an ever increasing tonnage being generated. However, the lack of an accurate estimate for PCB production, future supply and uncertain demands of its recycled materials in international markets has provided the motivation to explore different approaches to recycle PCBs. The work contained in this paper focuses on a novel, dry separation methodology in which vertical vibration is used to separate the metallic and non-metallic fractions of PCBs. When PCBs were comminuted to less than 1 mm in size, metallic grades as high as 95% (measured by heavy liquid analysis) could be achieved in the recovered products.","","Available from http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.wasman.2012.11.017","","","","United States","2013-03-15T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","Conference","Journal Name: Waste Management; Journal Volume: 33; Journal Issue: 3; Conference: 1. international symposium on urban mining (SUM), Bergamo (Italy), 21-23 May 2012; Other Information: Copyright (c) 2012 Elsevier Science B.V., Amsterdam, The Netherlands, All rights reserved.; Country of input: International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA)","","Medium: X; Size: page(s) 722-729","","","","Journal ID: ISSN 0956-053X; CODEN: WAMAE2; PII: S0956-053X(12)00540-5; TRN: US15R3140006242","10.1016/J.WASMAN.2012.11.017","","2016-03-04T00:00:00Z","22436799","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/22436799","","Waste Management","3","33"

Based on a unique dataset from a 2010 survey, our count models show that pro-environmental behavior, age, education, household size, marital status, gender of the head of household, dwelling type, and geographic location are statistically significant variables for explaining the number of broken or obsolete (junk) TVs stored by US households. We also estimate that they are storing approximately 84.1 million junk TVs, which represents 40 pounds of scrap per household. Materials in each of these junk TVs are worth $21 on average at January 2012 materials prices, which sets an upper bound on collecting and recycling costs. This information should be helpful for developing more effective recycling strategies for TVs in the e-waste stream.","","Available from http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.wasman.2012.07.020","","","","United States","2013-03-15T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","Conference","Journal Name: Waste Management; Journal Volume: 33; Journal Issue: 3; Conference: 1. international symposium on urban mining (SUM), Bergamo (Italy), 21-23 May 2012; Other Information: Copyright (c) 2012 Elsevier Science B.V., Amsterdam, The Netherlands, All rights reserved.; Country of input: International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA)","","Medium: X; Size: page(s) 519-529","","","","Journal ID: ISSN 0956-053X; CODEN: WAMAE2; PII: S0956-053X(12)00320-0; TRN: US15R3128009482","10.1016/J.WASMAN.2012.07.020","","2016-03-07T00:00:00Z","22439948","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/22439948","","Waste Management","3","33"

Chicken processing plants all over the world generate large amount of solid by-products in form of heads, legs, bones, viscera and feather. These wastes are often processed into livestock feed, fertilizers and pet foods or totally discarded. Inappropriate disposal of these wastes causes environmental pollution, diseases and loss of useful biological resources like protein, enzymes and lipids. Utilisation methods that make use of these biological components for producing value added products rather than the direct use of the actual waste material might be another viable option for dealing with these wastes. This line of thought has consequently led to researches on these wastes as sources of protein hydrolysates, enzymes and polyunsaturated fatty acids. Due to the multi-applications of protein hydrolysates in various branches of science and industry, and the large body of literature reporting the conversion of animal wastes to hydrolysates, a large section of this review was devoted to this subject. Thus, this review reports the known functional and bioactive properties of hydrolysates derived from chicken by-products as well their utilisation as source of peptone in microbiological media. Methods of producing these hydrolysates including their microbiological safety are discussed.

Highlights: ► More than 140 volatile compounds were identified in raw materials and WPC products. ► Markers were related to the thermal degradation, sawdust or coupling agents. ► WPC prototype showed a characteristic odor profile of burnt, sweet and wax-like. ► Aldehydes, carboxylic acids, ketones and phenols were odor descriptors of WPC. - Abstract: Application of wood plastic composites (WPCs) obtained from recycled materials initially intended for landfill is usually limited by their composition, mainly focused on release of volatile organic compounds (VOCs) which could affect quality or human safety. The study of the VOCs released by a material is a requirement for new composite materials. Characterization and quantification of VOCs of several WPC produced with low density polyethylene (LDPE) and polyethylene/ethylene vinyl acetate (PE/EVA) films and sawdust were carried out, in each stage of production, by solid phase microextraction in headspace mode (HS-SPME) and gas chromatography–mass spectrometry (GC–MS). An odor profile was also obtained by HS-SPME and GC–MS coupled with olfactometry analysis. More than 140 compounds were observed in the raw materials and WPC samples. Some quantified compounds were considered WPC markers such as furfural, 2-methoxyphenol, N-methylphthalimide and 2,4-di-tert-butylphenol. Hexanoic acid, acetic acid, 2-methoxyphenol, acetylfuran, diacetyl, and aldehydes were the most important odorants. None of the VOCs were found to affect human safety for use of the WPC.","","Available from http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.wasman.2012.11.005","","","","United States","2013-03-15T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","Conference","Journal Name: Waste Management; Journal Volume: 33; Journal Issue: 3; Conference: 1. international symposium on urban mining (SUM), Bergamo (Italy), 21-23 May 2012; Other Information: Copyright (c) 2012 Elsevier Science B.V., Amsterdam, The Netherlands, All rights reserved.; Country of input: International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA)","","Medium: X; Size: page(s) 645-655","","","","Journal ID: ISSN 0956-053X; CODEN: WAMAE2; PII: S0956-053X(12)00528-4; TRN: US15R3135009484","10.1016/J.WASMAN.2012.11.005","","2016-03-07T00:00:00Z","22439950","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/22439950","","Waste Management","3","33"

Previously, an optimum concrete mixture using both MSWI residues as aggregates was formulated. A compromise between the environmental behavior whilst maximizing the reuse of APC fly ash was considered and assessed. Unconfined compressive strength and abrasion resistance values were measured in order to evaluate the mechanical properties. From these results, the granular mixture was not suited for certain applications owing to the high BA/APC fly ash content and low cement percentages used to reduce the costs of the final product. Nevertheless, the leaching test performed showed that the concentrations of all heavy metals were below the limits established by the current Catalan legislation for their reutilization. Therefore, the material studied might be mainly used in embankments, where high mechanical properties are not needed and environmental safety is assured.","","Available from http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.wasman.2012.09.015","","","","United States","2013-03-15T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","Conference","Journal Name: Waste Management; Journal Volume: 33; Journal Issue: 3; Conference: 1. international symposium on urban mining (SUM), Bergamo (Italy), 21-23 May 2012; Other Information: Copyright (c) 2012 Elsevier Science B.V., Amsterdam, The Netherlands, All rights reserved.; Country of input: International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA)","","Medium: X; Size: page(s) 621-627","","","","Journal ID: ISSN 0956-053X; CODEN: WAMAE2; PII: S0956-053X(12)00431-X; TRN: US15R3133006236","10.1016/J.WASMAN.2012.09.015","","2016-03-04T00:00:00Z","22436793","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/22436793","","Waste Management","3","33"

Mechanical separation-oriented characterisation of WEEE was conducted in an attempt to evaluate the amenability of mechanical separation processes. Properties such as liberation degree of fractions (plastics, metals ferrous and non-ferrous), which are essential for mechanical separation, are analysed by means of a grain counting approach. Two different samples from different recycling industries were characterised in this work. The first sample is a heterogeneous material containing different types of plastics, metals (ferrous and non-ferrous), printed circuit board (PCB), rubber and wood. The second sample contains a mixture of mainly plastics. It is found for the first sample that all aluminium particles are free (100%) in all investigated size fractions. Between 92% and 95% of plastics are present as free particles; however, 67% in average of ferromagnetic particles are liberated. It can be observed that only 42% of ferromagnetic particles are free in the size fraction larger than 20 mm. Particle shapes were also quantified manually particle by particle. The results show that the particle shapes as a result of shredding, turn out to be heterogeneous, thereby complicating mechanical separation processes. In addition, the separability of various materials was ascertained by a sink–float analysis and eddy current separation. The second sample was separated by automatic sensor sorting in four different products: ABS, PC–ABS, PS and rest product. The fractions were characterised by using the methodology described in this paper. The results show that the grade and liberation degree of the plastic products ABS, PC–ABS and PS are close to 100%. Sink–float separation and infrared plastic identification equipment confirms the high plastic quality. On the basis of these findings, a global separation flow sheet is proposed to improve the plastic separation of WEEE.","","Available from http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.wasman.2012.04.007","","","","United States","2013-03-15T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","Conference","Journal Name: Waste Management; Journal Volume: 33; Journal Issue: 3; Conference: 1. international symposium on urban mining (SUM), Bergamo (Italy), 21-23 May 2012; Other Information: Copyright (c) 2012 Elsevier Science B.V., Amsterdam, The Netherlands, All rights reserved.; Country of input: International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA)","","Medium: X; Size: page(s) 706-713","","","","Journal ID: ISSN 0956-053X; CODEN: WAMAE2; PII: S0956-053X(12)00150-X; TRN: US15R3138006240","10.1016/J.WASMAN.2012.04.007","","2016-03-04T00:00:00Z","22436797","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/22436797","","Waste Management","3","33"

It is well known that the static structure factor of meta-toluidine shows a prepeak originating from clustering of the molecules through hydrogen bonding between the amine groups. The dynamics of meta-toluidine was measured for several values of the wavevector transfer Q, which is equivalent to an inverse length scale, in a range encompassing the prepeak and the structure factor peak. Data were collected in the temperature range corresponding to the liquid and supercooled states, down to the glass transition. At least two dynamical processes were identified. This paper focuses on the slowest relaxation process in the system, the {alpha}-relaxation, which was found to scale with the macroscopic shear viscosity at all the investigated Q values. No evidence of 'de Gennes' narrowing associated with the prepeak was observed, in contrast with what happens at the Q value corresponding to the interparticle distance. Moreover, using partially deuterated samples, the dynamics of the clusters was found to be correlated to the single-particle dynamics of the meta-toluidine molecules.","","","Oak Ridge National Lab.

However, the byproduct of this process is a fly ash (IFA), which contains large quantities of toxic contaminants. The purpose of this research study was to analyze the chemical, physical and mechanical behaviors resulting from the gradual introduction of IFA to an alkaline activated coal fly ash (CFA) matrix, as a mean of stabilizing the incinerator ash for use in industrial construction applications, where human exposure potential is limited. IFA and CFA were analyzed via X-ray fluorescence (XRF), X-ray diffraction (XRD) and Inductive coupled plasma (ICP) to obtain a full chemical analysis of the samples, its crystallographic characteristics and a detailed count of the eight heavy metals contemplated in US Title 40 of the Code of Federal Regulations (40 CFR). The particle size distribution of IFA and CFA was also recorded. EPA's Toxicity Characteristic Leaching Procedure (TCLP) was followed to monitor the leachability of the contaminants before and after the activation. Also images obtained via Scanning Electron Microscopy (SEM), before and after the activation, are presented. Concrete made from IFA, CFA and IFA-CFA mixes was subjected to a full mechanical characterization; tests include compressive strength, flexural strength, elastic modulus, Poisson's ratio and setting time.

Consequently, more stringent guidelines have been issued for the aging management of dry storage facilities that necessitate monitoring of the conditions of DCSSs. Continuous health monitoring of DCSSs based on temperature variations is one viable method for assessing the integrity of the system. In the present work, a novel ultrasonic temperature probe (UTP) is being tested for long-term online temperature monitoring of DCSSs. Its performance was evaluated and compared with type N thermocouple (NTC) and resistance temperature detector (RTD) using a small-scale dry storage canister mockup. Our preliminary results demonstrate that the UTP system developed at Argonne is able to achieve better than 0.8 Degree-Sign C accuracy, tested at temperatures of up to 400 Degree-Sign C. The temperature resolution is limited only by the sampling rate of the current system. The flexibility of the probe allows conforming to complex geometries thus making the sensor particularly suited to measurement scenarios where access is limited.","","","","","","United States","2013-01-25T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","Conference","Journal Name: AIP Conference Proceedings; Journal Volume: 1511; Journal Issue: 1; Conference: 39. annual review of progress in quantitative nondestructive evaluation, Denver, CO (United States), 15-20 Jul 2012; Other Information: (c) 2013 American Institute of Physics; Country of input: International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA)","","Medium: X; Size: page(s) 1526-1533","","","","Journal ID: ISSN 0094-243X; CODEN: APCPCS; TRN: US13A3365070476","10.1063/1.4789223","","2013-08-01T00:00:00Z","22113494","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/22113494","","AIP Conference Proceedings","1","1511"

Black-Right-Pointing-Pointer Adjustments to comply with regulation were adopted and reduction of waste was observed. Black-Right-Pointing-Pointer The method applied could be useful for similar establishments. - Abstract: According to the Brazilian law, implementation of a Medical Waste Management Plan (MWMP) in health-care units is mandatory, but as far as we know evaluation of such implementation has not taken place yet. The purpose of the present study is to evaluate the improvements deriving from the implementation of a MWMP in a Primary Health-care Center (PHC) located in the city of Sao Paulo, Brazil. The method proposed for evaluation compares the first situation prevailing at this PHC with the situation 1 year after implementation of the MWMP, thus allowing verification of the evolution of the PHC performance. For prior and post-diagnosis, the method was based on: (1) application of a tool (check list) which considered all legal requirements in force; (2) quantification of solid waste subdivided into three categories: infectious waste and sharp devices, recyclable materials and non-recyclable waste; and (3) identification of non-conformity practices. Lack of knowledge on the pertinent legislation by health workers has contributed to non-conformity instances. The legal requirements in force in Brazil today gave origin to a tool (check list) which was utilized in the management of medical waste at the health-care unit studied. This tool resulted into an adequate and simple instrument, required a low investment, allowed collecting data to feed indicators and also conquered the participation of the unit whole staff. Several non-conformities identified in the first diagnosis could be corrected by the instrument utilized. Total waste generation increased 9.8%, but it was possible to reduce the volume of non-recyclable materials (11%) and increase the volume of recyclable materials (4%). It was also possible to segregate organic waste (7%), which was forwarded for production of compost. The rate of infectious waste generation in critical areas decreased from 0.021 to 0.018 kg/procedure. Many improvements have been observed, and now the PHC complies with most of legal requirements, offers periodic training and better biosafety conditions to workers, has reduced the volume of waste sent to sanitary landfills, and has introduced indicators for monitoring its own performance. This evaluation method might subsidize the creation and evaluation of medical waste management plans in similar heath institutions.","","Available from http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.wasman.2012.09.018","","","","United States","2013-01-15T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: Waste Management; Journal Volume: 33; Journal Issue: 1; Other Information: Copyright (c) 2012 Elsevier Science B.V., Amsterdam, The Netherlands, All rights reserved.; Country of input: International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA)","","Medium: X; Size: page(s) 162-167","","","","Journal ID: ISSN 0956-053X; CODEN: WAMAE2; PII: S0956-053X(12)00457-6; TRN: US13R2127048639","10.1016/J.WASMAN.2012.09.018","","2013-05-17T00:00:00Z","22089915","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/22089915","","Waste Management","1","33"

Wastes of four major categories, namely, earthen, porcelain, plastic and coconut shells were monitored for positive with immature of either Aedes aegypti or Aedes albopictus. Twenty six types of wastes with varying size and shape, resembling containers, were identified that hosted mosquito immature. The number of waste containers positive for Aedes immature varied significantly (P < 0.05) with respect to location, type and month. The relative density of Aedes immature in the waste containers varied significantly (P < 0.05) with the types and months. The significant interaction between the month, waste container types and density of Aedes immature suggest that the household wastes are important contributors to the maintenance of the population of Aedes mosquito in the city. Based on the relative density of mosquito immature in the wastes, cluster analysis allowed segregation and classification of the wastes and their importance as mosquito larval habitats. Apparently, the containers that are most frequently disposed off contributed largely to the sustenance of Aedes mosquito population in the city. This calls for a strict legislation towards disposal as well as enhanced management of the household wastes. A link between the wastes disposed and subsequent conversion to the mosquito larval habitats cautions for continuance of Aedes population and possibility of dengue epidemics if the existing management practices are not improved.","","Available from http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.wasman.2012.09.013","","","","United States","2013-01-15T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: Waste Management; Journal Volume: 33; Journal Issue: 1; Other Information: Copyright (c) 2012 Elsevier Science B.V., Amsterdam, The Netherlands, All rights reserved.; Country of input: International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA)","","Medium: X; Size: page(s) 233-239","","","","Journal ID: ISSN 0956-053X; CODEN: WAMAE2; PII: S0956-053X(12)00425-4; TRN: US13R2131048640","10.1016/J.WASMAN.2012.09.013","","2013-05-17T00:00:00Z","22089916","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/22089916","","Waste Management","1","33"

Black-Right-Pointing-Pointer We have clustered all municipalities in order to find mutual comparable pairs. Black-Right-Pointing-Pointer Each pair consists of one private and one public operating waste collection program. Black-Right-Pointing-Pointer All cases show that private service has lower costs than public service. Black-Right-Pointing-Pointer Municipalities were contacted to identify the deeper causes for the waste management program. - Abstract: The rising pressure in terms of cost efficiency on public services pushes governments to transfer part of those services to the private sector. A trend towards more privatizing can be noticed in the collection of municipal household waste. This paper reports the findings of a research project aiming to compare the cost between the service of private and public collection of residual household waste. Multiple case studies of municipalities about the Flemish region of Belgium were conducted. Data concerning the year 2009 were gathered through in-depth interviews in 2010. In total 12 municipalities were investigated, divided into three mutual comparable pairs with a weekly and three mutual comparable pairs with a fortnightly residual waste collection. The results give a rough indication that in all cases the cost of private service is lower than public service in the collection of household waste. Albeit that there is an interest in establishing whether there are differences in the costs and service levels between public and private waste collection services, there are clear difficulties in establishing comparisons that can be made without having to rely on a large number of assumptions and corrections. However, given the cost difference, it remains the responsibility of the municipalities to decide upon the service they offer their citizens, regardless the cost efficiency: public or private.","","Available from http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.wasman.2012.08.015","","","","United States","2013-01-15T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: Waste Management; Journal Volume: 33; Journal Issue: 1; Other Information: Copyright (c) 2012 Elsevier Science B.V., Amsterdam, The Netherlands, All rights reserved.; Country of input: International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA)","","Medium: X; Size: page(s) 3-11","","","","Journal ID: ISSN 0956-053X; CODEN: WAMAE2; PII: S0956-053X(12)00381-9; TRN: US13R2119045012","10.1016/J.WASMAN.2012.08.015","","2013-05-17T00:00:00Z","22086574","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/22086574","","Waste Management","1","33"

Black-Right-Pointing-Pointer Determined how compaction affects the hydraulic conductivity of clay soils. Black-Right-Pointing-Pointer Analyzed the concentration of F and P and examined the retention of each soil. - Abstract: Three natural clayey soils from Tunisia were studied to assess their suitability for use as a liner for an acid waste disposal site. An investigation of the effect of the mineral composition and mechanical compaction on the hydraulic conductivity and fluoride and phosphate removal of three different soils is presented. The hydraulic conductivity of these three natural soils are 8.5 Multiplication-Sign 10{sup -10}, 2.08 Multiplication-Sign 10{sup -9} and 6.8 Multiplication-Sign 10{sup -10} m/s for soil-1, soil-2 and soil-3, respectively. Soil specimens were compacted under various compaction strains in order to obtain three wet densities (1850, 1950 and 2050 kg/m{sup 3}). In this condition, the hydraulic conductivity (k) was reduced with increasing density of sample for all soils. The test results of hydraulic conductivity at long-term (>200 days) using acidic waste solution (pH = 2.7, charged with fluoride and phosphate ions) shows a decrease in k with time only for natural soil-1 and soil-2. However, the specimens of soil-2 compressed to the two highest densities (1950 and 2050 kg/m{sup 3}) are cracked after 60 and 20 days, respectively, of hydraulic conductivity testing. This damage is the result of a continued increase in the internal stress due to the swelling and to the effect of aggressive wastewater. The analysis of anions shows that the retention of fluoride is higher compared to phosphate and soil-1 has the highest sorption capacity.","","Available from http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.wasman.2012.08.012","","","","United States","2013-01-15T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: Waste Management; Journal Volume: 33; Journal Issue: 1; Other Information: Copyright (c) 2012 Elsevier Science B.V., Amsterdam, The Netherlands, All rights reserved.; Country of input: International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA)","","Medium: X; Size: page(s) 60-66","","","","Journal ID: ISSN 0956-053X; CODEN: WAMAE2; PII: S0956-053X(12)00378-9; TRN: US13R2123045014","10.1016/J.WASMAN.2012.08.012","","2013-05-17T00:00:00Z","22086576","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/22086576","","Waste Management","1","33"

Black-Right-Pointing-Pointer The AD unit contributes more than 97% of total biogenic GHGs emissions. Black-Right-Pointing-Pointer AD with methane recovery is attractive for sludge GHGs emissions reduction. - Abstract: About 20 million tonnes of sludge (with 80% moisture content) is discharged by the sewage treatment plants per year in China, which, if not treated properly, can be a significant source of greenhouse gases (GHGs) emissions. Anaerobic digestion is a conventional sewage sludge treatment method and will continue to be one of the main technologies in the following years. This research has taken into consideration GHGs emissions from typical processes of sludge thickening + anaerobic digestion + dewatering + residue land application in China. Fossil CO{sub 2}, biogenic CO{sub 2}, CH{sub 4,} and avoided CO{sub 2} as the main objects is discussed respectively. The results show that the total CO{sub 2}-eq is about 1133 kg/t DM (including the biogenic CO{sub 2}), while the net CO{sub 2}-eq is about 372 kg/t DM (excluding the biogenic CO{sub 2}). An anaerobic digestion unit as the main GHGs emission source occupies more than 91% CO{sub 2}-eq of the whole process. The use of biogas is important for achieving carbon dioxide emission reductions, which could reach about 24% of the total CO{sub 2}-eq reduction.","","Available from http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.wasman.2012.06.024","","","","United States","2013-01-15T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: Waste Management; Journal Volume: 33; Journal Issue: 1; Other Information: Copyright (c) 2012 Elsevier Science B.V., Amsterdam, The Netherlands, All rights reserved.; Country of input: International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA)","","Medium: X; Size: page(s) 123-128","","","","Journal ID: ISSN 0956-053X; CODEN: WAMAE2; PII: S0956-053X(12)00296-6; TRN: US13R2125045016","10.1016/J.WASMAN.2012.06.024","","2013-05-17T00:00:00Z","22086578","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/22086578","","Waste Management","1","33"

Black-Right-Pointing-Pointer HCW treatment using microwave oven had the lowest environmental impacts and costs in comparison with autoclave and lime. Black-Right-Pointing-Pointer Lime had the worst environmental and economic results for HCW treatment, in comparison with autoclave and microwave. - Abstract: The establishment of rules to manage Health Care Waste (HCW) is a challenge for the public sector. Regulatory agencies must ensure the safety of waste management alternatives for two very different profiles of generators: (1) hospitals, which concentrate the production of HCW and (2) small establishments, such as clinics, pharmacies and other sources, that generate dispersed quantities of HCW and are scattered throughout the city. To assist in developing sector regulations for the small generators, we evaluated three management scenarios using decision-making tools. They consisted of a disinfection technique (microwave, autoclave and lime) followed by landfilling, where transportation was also included. The microwave, autoclave and lime techniques were tested at the laboratory to establish the operating parameters to ensure their efficiency in disinfection. Using a life cycle assessment (LCA) and cost analysis, the decision-making tools aimed to determine the technique with the best environmental performance. This consisted of evaluating the eco-efficiency of each scenario. Based on the life cycle assessment, microwaving had the lowest environmental impact (12.64 Pt) followed by autoclaving (48.46 Pt). The cost analyses indicated values of US$ 0.12 kg{sup -1} for the waste treated with microwaves, US$ 1.10 kg{sup -1} for the waste treated by the autoclave and US$ 1.53 kg{sup -1} for the waste treated with lime. The microwave disinfection presented the best eco-efficiency performance among those studied and provided a feasible alternative to subsidize the formulation of the policy for small generators of HCW.","","Available from http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.wasman.2012.09.021","","","","United States","2013-01-15T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: Waste Management; Journal Volume: 33; Journal Issue: 1; Other Information: Copyright (c) 2012 Elsevier Science B.V., Amsterdam, The Netherlands, All rights reserved.; Country of input: International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA)","","Medium: X; Size: page(s) 175-183","","","","Journal ID: ISSN 0956-053X; CODEN: WAMAE2; PII: S0956-053X(12)00460-6; TRN: US13R2128045017","10.1016/J.WASMAN.2012.09.021","","2013-05-17T00:00:00Z","22086579","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/22086579","","Waste Management","1","33"

Waste composition is influenced by many factors; it can vary from year to year, seasonally, and with location, for example. The data publicly available at a municipal level can be highly aggregated and sometimes incomplete, and performing composition analysis is technically challenging. Uncertainty is therefore always present in waste composition. This article performs uncertainty analysis on a systematically modified waste composition using a constructed waste management system. In addition the environmental impacts of several waste management strategies are compared when applied to five different cities. We thus discuss the effect of uncertainty in both accounting LCA and comparative LCA. We found the waste composition to be important for the total environmental impact of the system, especially for the global warming, nutrient enrichment and human toxicity via water impact categories.","","Available from http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.wasman.2012.09.020","","","","United States","2013-01-15T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: Waste Management; Journal Volume: 33; Journal Issue: 1; Other Information: Copyright (c) 2012 Elsevier Science B.V., Amsterdam, The Netherlands, All rights reserved.; Country of input: International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA)","","Medium: X; Size: page(s) 212-219","","","","Journal ID: ISSN 0956-053X; CODEN: WAMAE2; PII: S0956-053X(12)00459-X; TRN: US13R2129045018","10.1016/J.WASMAN.2012.09.020","","2013-05-17T00:00:00Z","22086580","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/22086580","","Waste Management","1","33"

In Italy the increase of WEEE collection was achieved in parallel with the increase of the efficiency of selective Municipal Solid Waste collection. In Romania, pilot experiences were useful to increase the awareness of the population. The different interests of the two populations towards recyclable waste led to a different scenario: in Romania all types of WEEE have been collected since its entrance into the EU; in Italy the 'interest' in recycling is typically related to large household appliances, with a secondary role of lighting equipment.","","Available from http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.wasman.2012.07.029","","","","United States","2013-01-15T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: Waste Management; Journal Volume: 33; Journal Issue: 1; Other Information: Copyright (c) 2012 Elsevier Science B.V., Amsterdam, The Netherlands, All rights reserved.; Country of input: International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA)","","Medium: X; Size: page(s) 117-122","","","","Journal ID: ISSN 0956-053X; CODEN: WAMAE2; PII: S0956-053X(12)00355-8; TRN: US13R2124045015","10.1016/J.WASMAN.2012.07.029","","2013-05-17T00:00:00Z","22086577","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/22086577","","Waste Management","1","33"

An analysis of literature on the work done and reported mainly in publications from 2005 to 2011, related to waste management in developing countries, showed that few articles give quantitative information. The analysis was conducted in two of the major scientific journals, Waste Management Journal and Waste Management and Research. The objective of this research was to determine the stakeholders' action/behavior that have a role in the waste management process and to analyze influential factors on the system, in more than thirty urban areas in 22 developing countries in 4 continents. A combination of methods was used in this study in order to assess the stakeholders and the factors influencing the performance of waste management in the cities. Data was collected from scientific literature, existing data bases, observations made during visits to urban areas, structured interviews with relevant professionals, exercises provided to participants in workshops and a questionnaire applied to stakeholders. Descriptive and inferential statistic methods were used to draw conclusions. The outcomes of the research are a comprehensive list of stakeholders that are relevant in the waste management systems and a set of factors that reveal the most important causes for the systems' failure.

Particularly, an increasing amount of construction and demolition (C and D) waste is being disposed at landfill sites. In order to reduce waste generation and encourage reuse and recycling, the Hong Kong Government has implemented the Construction Waste Disposal Charging Scheme (CWDCS) to levy charges on C and D waste disposal to landfills. In order to provide information on the changes in reducing waste generation practice among construction participants in various work trades, a study was conducted after 3 years of implementation of the CWDCS via a structured questionnaire survey in the building industry in Hong Kong. The study result has revealed changes with work flows of the major trades as well as differentiating the levels of waste reduced. Three building projects in the public and private sectors were selected as case studies to demonstrate the changes in work flows and the reduction of waste achieved. The research findings reveal that a significant reduction of construction waste was achieved at the first 3 years (2006-2008) of CWDCS implementation. However, the reduction cannot be sustained. The major trades have been influenced to a certain extent by the implementation of the CWDCS. Slight improvement in waste management practices was observed, but reduction of construction waste in the wet-finishing and dry-finishing trades has undergone little improvement. Implementation of the CWDCS has not yet motivated subcontractors to change their methods of construction so as to reduce C and D waste.","","Available from http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.wasman.2012.09.023","","","","United States","2013-01-15T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: Waste Management; Journal Volume: 33; Journal Issue: 1; Other Information: Copyright (c) 2012 Elsevier Science B.V., Amsterdam, The Netherlands, All rights reserved.; Country of input: International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA)","","Medium: X; Size: page(s) 138-146","","","","Journal ID: ISSN 0956-053X; CODEN: WAMAE2; PII: S0956-053X(12)00462-X; TRN: US13R2126048638","10.1016/J.WASMAN.2012.09.023","","2013-05-17T00:00:00Z","22089914","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/22089914","","Waste Management","1","33"
"Thermal Analysis for Ion-Exchange Column System","Lee, Si Y.; King, William D.","12 MANAGEMENT OF RADIOACTIVE AND NON-RADIOACTIVE WASTES FROM NUCLEAR FACILITIES; Thermal Modeling, Cesium Removal, Packed Column, Radioactive Waste Storage Tank, High Level Waste, Crystalline Silicotitanate","Models have been developed to simulate the thermal characteristics of crystalline silicotitanate ion exchange media fully loaded with radioactive cesium either in a column configuration or distributed within a waste storage tank. This work was conducted to support the design and operation of a waste treatment process focused on treating dissolved, high-sodium salt waste solutions for the removal of specific radionuclides. The ion exchange column will be installed inside a high level waste storage tank at the Savannah River Site. After cesium loading, the ion exchange media may be transferred to the waste tank floor for interim storage. Models were used to predict temperature profiles in these areas of the system where the cesium-loaded media is expected to lead to localized regions of elevated temperature due to radiolytic decay. Normal operating conditions and accident scenarios (including loss of solution flow, inadvertent drainage, and loss of active cooling) were evaluated for the ion exchange column using bounding conditions to establish the design safety basis. The modeling results demonstrate that the baseline design using one central and four outer cooling tubes provides a highly efficient cooling mechanism for reducing the maximum column temperature. In-tank modeling results revealed that an idealized hemispherical mound shape leads to the highest tank floor temperatures. In contrast, even large volumes of CST distributed in a flat layer with a cylindrical shape do not result in significant floor heating.","","","Savannah River Site (SRS), Aiken, SC (United States)","USDOE (United States)","","United States","2012-12-20T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: Nuclear Engineering and Design; Journal Volume: 259","","Medium: ED; Size: 102-112","","SRNL-STI-2012-00788","DE-AC09-08SR22470","TRN: US1400095","","","2014-04-03T00:00:00Z","1096424","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/1096424","https://www.osti.gov/servlets/purl/1096424","Nuclear Engineering and Design","","259"

Total nitrogen losses, which resulted mainly from ammonia emissions and nitrification-denitrification, accounted for 1-76% of the initial nitrogen. Ammonification was the main process responsible for nitrogen losses. An equation which allows estimating the ammonification flow of each type of waste according to its biodegradable carbon and carbon/nitrogen ratio was proposed. As a consequence of the lower contribution of storage and leachate rates, stripping and nitrification rates of ammonia nitrogen were negatively correlated. This observation suggests the possibility of promotingnitrification in order to reduce ammonia emissions.","","Available from http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.wasman.2012.07.006","","","","United States","2012-12-15T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: Waste Management; Journal Volume: 32; Journal Issue: 12; Other Information: Copyright (c) 2012 Elsevier Science B.V., Amsterdam, The Netherlands, All rights reserved.; Country of input: International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA)","","Medium: X; Size: page(s) 2239-2247","","","","Journal ID: ISSN 0956-053X; CODEN: WAMAE2; PII: S0956-053X(12)00306-6; TRN: US13R2100048622","10.1016/J.WASMAN.2012.07.006","","2013-05-17T00:00:00Z","22089898","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/22089898","","Waste Management","12","32"

Black-Right-Pointing-Pointer The amount of aluminium packaging recoverable from the bottom ashes is evaluated. Black-Right-Pointing-Pointer Aluminium packaging oxidation rate in the residues of MSW incineration is evaluated. Black-Right-Pointing-Pointer 80% of aluminium cans, 51% of trays and 27% of foils can be recovered from bottom ashes. - Abstract: Ferrous and non-ferrous metal scraps are increasingly recovered from municipal solid waste incineration bottom ash and used in the production of secondary steel and aluminium. However, during the incineration process, metal scraps contained in the waste undergo volatilisation and oxidation processes, which determine a loss of their recoverable mass. The present paper evaluates the behaviour of different types of aluminium packaging materials in a full-scale waste to energy plant during standard operation. Their partitioning and oxidation level in the residues of the incineration process are evaluated, together with the amount of potentially recoverable aluminium. About 80% of post-consumer cans, 51% of trays and 27% of foils can be recovered through an advanced treatment of bottom ash combined with a melting process in the saline furnace for the production of secondary aluminium. The residual amount of aluminium concentrates in the fly ash or in the fine fraction of the bottom ash and its recovery is virtually impossible using the current eddy current separation technology. The average oxidation levels of the aluminium in the residues of the incineration process is equal to 9.2% for cans, 17.4% for trays and 58.8% for foils. The differences between the tested packaging materials are related to their thickness, mechanical strength and to the alloy.","","Available from http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.wasman.2012.06.003","","","","United States","2012-12-15T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: Waste Management; Journal Volume: 32; Journal Issue: 12; Other Information: Copyright (c) 2012 Elsevier Science B.V., Amsterdam, The Netherlands, All rights reserved.; Country of input: International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA)","","Medium: X; Size: page(s) 2266-2272","","","","Journal ID: ISSN 0956-053X; CODEN: WAMAE2; PII: S0956-053X(12)00256-5; TRN: US13R2101048623","10.1016/J.WASMAN.2012.06.003","","2013-05-17T00:00:00Z","22089899","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/22089899","","Waste Management","12","32"

These kinds of problems are pathological symptoms of existing problematical human-nature relationship which is related to the syndrome called ecological crisis. In this regard, solving the site selection problem, which is just a small part of a larger entity, for the good of ecological rationality and social justice is only possible by founding a new and extensive type of human-nature relationship. In this study, as a problematic point regarding the discussions on ecological problems, the existing structure of the applications using multi-criteria decision analysis in the process of site selection with three main criteria is criticized. Based on this critique, fundamental problematic points (to which applications are insufficient to find solutions) will be defined. Later, some modifications will be suggested in order to provide solutions to these problematical points. Finally, the criticism addressed to the structure of the method with three main criteria and the feasibility of the new method with four main criteria is subjected to an evaluation process. As a result, it is emphasized that the new structure with four main criteria may be effective in solution of the fundamental problematic points.","","Available from http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.wasman.2012.07.003","","","","United States","2012-12-15T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: Waste Management; Journal Volume: 32; Journal Issue: 12; Other Information: Copyright (c) 2012 Elsevier Science B.V., Amsterdam, The Netherlands, All rights reserved.; Country of input: International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA)","","Medium: X; Size: page(s) 2315-2323","","","","Journal ID: ISSN 0956-053X; CODEN: WAMAE2; PII: S0956-053X(12)00302-9; TRN: US13R2103048625","10.1016/J.WASMAN.2012.07.003","","2013-05-17T00:00:00Z","22089901","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/22089901","","Waste Management","12","32"

Black-Right-Pointing-Pointer Examined how covers influence gas emissions, water balance and leachate generation. Black-Right-Pointing-Pointer Investigated effect of top covers on air-distribution in waste mass during aeration. Black-Right-Pointing-Pointer We suggest criteria and cover design to meet the demands during and after aeration. Black-Right-Pointing-Pointer Such cover systems may offer greenhouse gas emission reduction also after active aeration. - Abstract: Landfill aeration by means of low pressure air injection is a promising tool to reduce long term emissions from organic waste fractions through accelerated biological stabilization. Top covers that enhance methane oxidation could provide a simple and economic way to mitigate residual greenhouse gas emissions from in situ aerated landfills, and may replace off-gas extraction and treatment, particularly at smaller and older sites. In this respect the installation of a landfill cover system adjusted to the forced-aerated landfill body is of great significance. Investigations into large scale lysimeters (2 Multiplication-Sign 2 Multiplication-Sign 3 m) under field conditions have been carried out using different top covers including compost materials and natural soils as a surrogate to gas extraction during active low pressure aeration. In the present study, the emission behaviour as well as the water balance performance of the lysimeters has been investigated, both prior to and during the first months of in situ aeration. Results reveal that mature sewage sludge compost (SSC) placed in one lysimeter exhibits in principle optimal ambient conditions for methanotrophic bacteria to enhance methane oxidation. Under laboratory conditions the mature compost mitigated CH{sub 4} loadings up to 300 l CH{sub 4}/m{sup 2} d. In addition, the compost material provided high air permeability even at 100% water holding capacity (WHC). In contrast, the more cohesive, mineral soil cover was expected to cause a notably uniform distribution of the injected air within the waste layer. Laboratory results also revealed sufficient air permeability of the soil materials (TS-F and SS-Z) placed in lysimeter C. However, at higher compaction density SS-Z became impermeable at 100% WHC. Methane emissions from the reference lysimeter with the smaller substrate cover (12-52 g CH{sub 4}/m{sup 2} d) were significantly higher than fluxes from the other lysimeters (0-19 g CH{sub 4}/m{sup 2} d) during in situ aeration. Regarding water balance, lysimeters covered with compost and compost-sand mixture, showed the lowest leachate rate (18-26% of the precipitation) due to the high water holding capacity and more favourable plant growth conditions compared to the lysimeters with mineral, more cohesive, soil covers (27-45% of the precipitation). On the basis of these results, the authors suggest a layered top cover system using both compost material as well as mineral soil in order to support active low-pressure aeration. Conventional soil materials with lower permeability may be used on top of the landfill body for a more uniform aeration of the waste due to an increased resistance to vertical gas flow. A compost cover may be built on top of the soil cover underlain by a gas distribution layer to improve methane oxidation rates and minimise water infiltration. By planting vegetation with a high transpiration rate, the leachate amount emanating from the landfill could be further minimised. The suggested design may be particularly suitable in combination with intermittent in situ aeration, in the later stage of an aeration measure, or at very small sites and shallow deposits. The top cover system could further regulate water infiltration into the landfill and mitigate residual CH{sub 4} emissions, even beyond the time of active aeration.","","Available from http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.wasman.2012.06.004","","","","United States","2012-12-15T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: Waste Management; Journal Volume: 32; Journal Issue: 12; Other Information: Copyright (c) 2012 Elsevier Science B.V., Amsterdam, The Netherlands, All rights reserved.; Country of input: International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA)","","Medium: X; Size: page(s) 2324-2335","","","","Journal ID: ISSN 0956-053X; CODEN: WAMAE2; PII: S0956-053X(12)00257-7; TRN: US13R2104048626","10.1016/J.WASMAN.2012.06.004","","2013-05-17T00:00:00Z","22089902","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/22089902","","Waste Management","12","32"

While some countries have greatly reduced their reliance on landfills, there remain thousands of landfills that require aftercare. The development of cost-effective strategies for landfill aftercare is in society's interest to protect human health and the environment and to prevent the emergence of landfills with exhausted aftercare funding. The Evaluation of Post-Closure Care (EPCC) methodology is a performance-based approach in which landfill performance is assessed in four modules including leachate, gas, groundwater, and final cover. In the methodology, the objective is to evaluate landfill performance to determine when aftercare monitoring and maintenance can be reduced or possibly eliminated. This study presents an improved gas module for the methodology. While the original version of the module focused narrowly on regulatory requirements for control of methane migration, the improved gas module also considers best available control technology for landfill gas in terms of greenhouse gas emissions, air quality, and emissions of odoriferous compounds. The improved module emphasizes the reduction or elimination of fugitive methane by considering the methane oxidation capacity of the cover system. The module also allows for the installation of biologically active covers or other features designed to enhance methane oxidation. A methane emissions model, CALMIM, was used to assist with an assessment of the methane oxidation capacity of landfill covers.","","Available from http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.wasman.2012.07.017","","","","United States","2012-12-15T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: Waste Management; Journal Volume: 32; Journal Issue: 12; Other Information: Copyright (c) 2012 Elsevier Science B.V., Amsterdam, The Netherlands, All rights reserved.; Country of input: International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA)","","Medium: X; Size: page(s) 2364-2373","","","","Journal ID: ISSN 0956-053X; CODEN: WAMAE2; PII: S0956-053X(12)00317-0; TRN: US13R2106048627","10.1016/J.WASMAN.2012.07.017","","2013-05-17T00:00:00Z","22089903","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/22089903","","Waste Management","12","32"

Leachate generated from municipal landfills has become a great threat to the surroundings as it contains high concentration of organics, ammonia and other toxic pollutants. Emphasis has to be placed on the removal of ammonia nitrogen in particular, derived from the nitrogen content of the MSW and it is a long term pollution problem in landfills which determines when the landfill can be considered stable. Several biological processes are available for the removal of ammonia but novel processes such as the Single Reactor System for High Activity Ammonia Removal over Nitrite (SHARON) and Anaerobic Ammonium Oxidation (ANAMMOX) process have great potential and several advantages over conventional processes. The combined SHARON-ANAMMOX process for municipal landfill leachate treatment is a new, innovative and significant approach that requires more research to identify and solve critical issues. This review addresses the operational parameters, microbiology, biochemistry and application of both the processes to remove ammonia from leachate.","","Available from http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.wasman.2012.06.006","","","","United States","2012-12-15T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: Waste Management; Journal Volume: 32; Journal Issue: 12; Other Information: Copyright (c) 2012 Elsevier Science B.V., Amsterdam, The Netherlands, All rights reserved.; Country of input: International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA)","","Medium: X; Size: page(s) 2385-2400","","","","Journal ID: ISSN 0956-053X; CODEN: WAMAE2; PII: S0956-053X(12)00259-0; TRN: US13R2107048628","10.1016/J.WASMAN.2012.06.006","","2013-05-17T00:00:00Z","22089904","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/22089904","","Waste Management","12","32"

Black-Right-Pointing-Pointer System-boundary settings often vary largely in reviewed studies. Black-Right-Pointing-Pointer Existing LCA guidelines give varying recommendations in relation to several key issues. - Abstract: Twenty-five comparative cycle assessments (LCAs) addressing food waste treatment were reviewed, including the treatment alternatives landfill, thermal treatment, compost (small and large scale) and anaerobic digestion. The global warming potential related to these treatment alternatives varies largely amongst the studies. Large differences in relation to setting of system boundaries, methodological choices and variations in used input data were seen between the studies. Also, a number of internal contradictions were identified, many times resulting in biased comparisons between alternatives. Thus, noticed differences in global warming potential are not found to be a result of actual differences in the environmental impacts from studied systems, but rather to differences in the performance of the study. A number of key issues with high impact on the overall global warming potential from different treatment alternatives for food waste were identified through the use of one-way sensitivity analyses in relation to a previously performed LCA of food waste management. Assumptions related to characteristics in treated waste, losses and emissions of carbon, nutrients and other compounds during the collection, storage and pretreatment, potential energy recovery through combustion, emissions from composting, emissions from storage and land use of bio-fertilizers and chemical fertilizers and eco-profiles of substituted goods were all identified as highly relevant for the outcomes of this type of comparisons. As the use of LCA in this area is likely to increase in coming years, it is highly relevant to establish more detailed guidelines within this field in order to increase both the general quality in assessments as well as the potentials for cross-study comparisons.","","Available from http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.wasman.2012.07.023","","","","United States","2012-12-15T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: Waste Management; Journal Volume: 32; Journal Issue: 12; Other Information: Copyright (c) 2012 Elsevier Science B.V., Amsterdam, The Netherlands, All rights reserved.; Country of input: International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA)","","Medium: X; Size: page(s) 2439-2455","","","","Journal ID: ISSN 0956-053X; CODEN: WAMAE2; PII: S0956-053X(12)00345-5; TRN: US13R2108048629","10.1016/J.WASMAN.2012.07.023","","2013-05-17T00:00:00Z","22089905","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/22089905","","Waste Management","12","32"

In this context, a vast number of options ranging from small scale decentralized to larger scale centralized plants have been adopted. This study aimed at investigating the waste reuse schemes in Khulna city located in the southern part of Bangladesh and ranked third largest city in the country. The shops for reusable material (SRM) were mostly situated around railway, waterway, and truck station markets which provided easy transportation to further locations. For the reuses of waste materials and products, a chain system was found to collect reusable wastes under a total number of 310 identified SRM with 859 persons directly or indirectly involved in the scheme. This was a decentralized waste management system with self sufficient (autonomous) management. According to mass balance, about 38.52 tons d{sup -1} solid wastes were reused in Khulna city area, accounting for 7.65% of the total generated wastes. This study revealed that apparently a silent, systematic, smooth, and clean reuse chain has been established in Khulna city area under private initiatives, whose sustainability was confirmed over the years in the country without any official or formal funds. However, proper adjustment between the higher and lower chain in the materials flow path, as well as personal hygiene training for the workers, would further improve the achievements of the established reuse scheme.","","Available from http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.wasman.2012.07.001","","","","United States","2012-12-15T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: Waste Management; Journal Volume: 32; Journal Issue: 12; Other Information: Copyright (c) 2012 Elsevier Science B.V., Amsterdam, The Netherlands, All rights reserved.; Country of input: International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA)","","Medium: X; Size: page(s) 2526-2534","","","","Journal ID: ISSN 0956-053X; CODEN: WAMAE2; PII: S0956-053X(12)00297-8; TRN: US13R2112048630","10.1016/J.WASMAN.2012.07.001","","2013-05-17T00:00:00Z","22089906","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/22089906","","Waste Management","12","32"

Black-Right-Pointing-Pointer Semi-mechanized landfills can be a sustainable option for small cities. Black-Right-Pointing-Pointer We present the theory of design and operation of semi-mechanized landfills. Black-Right-Pointing-Pointer Villanueva, Honduras has operated its semi-mechanized landfill for 15 years. Black-Right-Pointing-Pointer The cost of operation is US$4.60/ton with a land requirement of 0.2m{sup 2}/person-year. - Abstract: Open dumping is the most common practice for the disposal of urban solid wastes in the least developed regions of Africa, Asia and Latin America. Sanitary landfill design and operation has traditionally focused on large cities, but cities with fewer than 50,000 in population can comprise from 6% to 45% of a given country's total population. These thousands of small cities cannot afford to operate a sanitary landfill in the way it is proposed for large cities, where heavy equipment is used to spread and compact the waste in daily cells, and then to excavate, transport and apply daily cover, and leachate is managed with collection and treatment systems. This paper presents an alternative approach for small cities, known as the semi-mechanized trench method, which was developed in Villanueva, Honduras. In the semi-mechanized trench method a hydraulic excavator is used for 1-3 days to dig a trench that will last at least a month before it is filled with waste. Trucks can easily unload their wastes into the trench, and the wastes compact naturally due to semi-aerobic biodegradation, after which the trenches are refilled and covered. The exposed surface area is minimal since only the top surface of the wastes is exposed, the remainder being covered by the sides and bottom of the trench. The surplus material from trench excavation can be valorized for use as engineering fill onsite or off. The landfill in Villanueva has operated for 15 years, using a total land area of approximately 11 ha for a population that grew from 23,000 to 48,000, with a land requirement of 0.2 m{sup 2}/person year, a cover to waste ratio of 0.2, and an estimated soil surplus of 298,000 m{sup 3} that is valorized and used onsite. The landfill has been operated solely by the municipality with an operational cost in 2010 estimated at US$4.60 per ton. A modified water balance analysis at Villanueva shows negligible leachate generation from covered trenches and 700 m{sup 3}/yr (60 m{sup 3}/ha yr) from the two open trenches required for daily operation. If the site were an open dump, however, leachate generation is estimated to be 3900 m{sup 3}/ha yr and contaminated runoff 5000 m{sup 3}/ha yr. A simple model used to estimate dilution of generated leachate based on groundwater flow data and aquifer stratigraphy suggests that the leachate will be diluted by a factor of 0.01 in the aquifer. Leachate contaminants will not accumulate because the aquifer discharges to the Ulua River 2 km south of the landfill. While not suitable for all sites, the Villanueva method nevertheless serves as an excellent example of how a small city landfill with natural compaction of waste and attenuation of leachate can be sustainably operated.","","Available from http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.wasman.2012.07.030","","","","United States","2012-12-15T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: Waste Management; Journal Volume: 32; Journal Issue: 12; Other Information: Copyright (c) 2012 Elsevier Science B.V., Amsterdam, The Netherlands, All rights reserved.; Country of input: International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA)","","Medium: X; Size: page(s) 2535-2551","","","","Journal ID: ISSN 0956-053X; CODEN: WAMAE2; PII: S0956-053X(12)00365-0; TRN: US13R2113048631","10.1016/J.WASMAN.2012.07.030","","2013-05-17T00:00:00Z","22089907","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/22089907","","Waste Management","12","32"

By merging well-known attitude-behaviour theories with elements from wider models from environmental psychology, an extensive cognitive framework that provides new and valuable insights is developed for understanding the involvement of individuals in waste prevention. The results confirm the usefulness of the theory of planned behaviour and of Schwartz's altruistic behaviour model as bases for modelling participation in waste prevention. A more elaborate integrated model of prevention was shown to be necessary for the complete analysis of attitudinal aspects associated with waste prevention. A postal survey of 158 respondents provided empirical support for eight of 12 hypotheses. The proposed structural equation indicates that personal norms and perceived behaviour control are the main predictors and that, unlike the case of recycling, subjective norms have a weak influence on WPB. It also suggests that, since social norms have not presented a direct influence, WPB is likely to be influenced by a concern for the environment and the community as well by perceptions of moral obligation and inconvenience. Results also proved that recycling and waste prevention represent different dimensions of waste management behaviour requiring particular approaches to increase individuals' engagement in future policies.","","Available from http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.wasman.2012.05.037","","","","United States","2012-12-15T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: Waste Management; Journal Volume: 32; Journal Issue: 12; Other Information: Copyright (c) 2012 Elsevier Science B.V., Amsterdam, The Netherlands, All rights reserved.; Country of input: International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA)","","Medium: X; Size: page(s) 2195-2207","","","","Journal ID: ISSN 0956-053X; CODEN: WAMAE2; PII: S0956-053X(12)00248-6; TRN: US13R2098045005","10.1016/J.WASMAN.2012.05.037","","2013-05-17T00:00:00Z","22086567","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/22086567","","Waste Management","12","32"
"Screening tests for hazard classification of complex waste materials - Selection of methods","Weltens, R; Vanermen, G; Tirez, K; Robbens, J; Deprez, K; Michiels, L","12 MANAGEMENT OF RADIOACTIVE WASTES, AND NON-RADIOACTIVE WASTES FROM NUCLEAR FACILITIES; CLASSIFICATION; CONSUMER PRODUCTS; ENVIRONMENTAL EFFECTS; HEALTH HAZARDS; RISK ASSESSMENT; TOXICITY; WASTE MANAGEMENT; WASTES","In this study we describe the development of an alternative methodology for hazard characterization of waste materials. Such an alternative methodology for hazard assessment of complex waste materials is urgently needed, because the lack of a validated instrument leads to arbitrary hazard classification of such complex waste materials. False classification can lead to human and environmental health risks and also has important financial consequences for the waste owner. The Hazardous Waste Directive (HWD) describes the methodology for hazard classification of waste materials. For mirror entries the HWD classification is based upon the hazardous properties (H1-15) of the waste which can be assessed from the hazardous properties of individual identified waste compounds or - if not all compounds are identified - from test results of hazard assessment tests performed on the waste material itself. For the latter the HWD recommends toxicity tests that were initially designed for risk assessment of chemicals in consumer products (pharmaceuticals, cosmetics, biocides, food, etc.). These tests (often using mammals) are not designed nor suitable for the hazard characterization of waste materials. With the present study we want to contribute to the development of an alternative and transparent test strategy for hazard assessment of complex wastes that is in line with the HWD principles for waste classification. It is necessary to cope with this important shortcoming in hazardous waste classification and to demonstrate that alternative methods are available that can be used for hazard assessment of waste materials. Next, by describing the pros and cons of the available methods, and by identifying the needs for additional or further development of test methods, we hope to stimulate research efforts and development in this direction. In this paper we describe promising techniques and argument on the test selection for the pilot study that we have performed on different types of waste materials. Test results are presented in a second paper. As the application of many of the proposed test methods is new in the field of waste management, the principles of the tests are described. The selected tests tackle important hazardous properties but refinement of the test battery is needed to fulfil the a priori conditions.","","Available from http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.wasman.2012.05.013","","","","United States","2012-12-15T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: Waste Management; Journal Volume: 32; Journal Issue: 12; Other Information: Copyright (c) 2012 Elsevier Science B.V., Amsterdam, The Netherlands, All rights reserved.; Country of input: International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA)","","Medium: X; Size: page(s) 2208-2217","","","","Journal ID: ISSN 0956-053X; CODEN: WAMAE2; PII: S0956-053X(12)00222-X; TRN: US13R2099045006","10.1016/J.WASMAN.2012.05.013","","2013-05-17T00:00:00Z","22086568","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/22086568","","Waste Management","12","32"

Black-Right-Pointing-Pointer Dredged sediment provided sufficient water storage and promoted growth by native plant species. Black-Right-Pointing-Pointer Native plant mixtures attained acceptable rates of evapotranspiration throughout the growing season. - Abstract: Evapotranspiration (ET) covers have gained interest as an alternative to conventional covers for the closure of municipal solid waste (MSW) landfills because they are less costly to construct and are expected to have a longer service life. Whereas ET covers have gained acceptance in arid and semi-arid regions (defined by a precipitation (P) to potential evapotranspiration (PET) ratio less than 0.75) by meeting performance standards (e.g. rate of percolation), it remains unclear whether they are suitable for humid regions (P:PET greater than 0.75). The goal of this project is to extend their application to northwest Ohio (P:PET equals 1.29) by designing covers that produce a rate of percolation less than 32 cm yr{sup -1}, the maximum acceptable rate by the Ohio Environmental Protection Agency (OEPA). Test ET covers were constructed in drainage lysimeters (1.52 m diameter, 1.52 m depth) using dredged sediment amended with organic material and consisted of immature (I, plants seeded onto soil) or mature (M, plants transferred from a restored tall-grass prairie) plant mixtures. The water balance for the ET covers was monitored from June 2009 to June 2011, which included measured precipitation and percolation, and estimated soil water storage and evapotranspiration. Precipitation was applied at a rate of 94 cm yr{sup -1} in the first year and at rate of 69 cm yr{sup -1} in the second year. During the first year, covers with the M plant mixture produced noticeably less percolation (4 cm) than covers with the I plant mixture (17 cm). However, during the second year, covers with the M plant mixture produced considerably more percolation (10 cm) than covers with the I plant mixture (3 cm). This is likely due to a decrease in the aboveground biomass for the M plant mixture from year 1 (1008 g m{sup -2}) to year 2 (794 g m{sup -2}) and an increase for the I plant mixture from year 1 (644 g m{sup -2}) to year 2 (1314 g m{sup -2}). Over the 2-year period, the mean annual rates of percolation for the covers with the M and I plant mixtures were 7 and 8 cm yr{sup -1}, which are below the OEPA standard. The results suggest the application of ET covers be extended to northwest Ohio and other humid regions.","","Available from http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.wasman.2012.07.014","","","","United States","2012-12-15T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: Waste Management; Journal Volume: 32; Journal Issue: 12; Other Information: Copyright (c) 2012 Elsevier Science B.V., Amsterdam, The Netherlands, All rights reserved.; Country of input: International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA)","","Medium: X; Size: page(s) 2336-2341","","","","Journal ID: ISSN 0956-053X; CODEN: WAMAE2; PII: S0956-053X(12)00314-5; TRN: US13R2105045007","10.1016/J.WASMAN.2012.07.014","","2013-05-17T00:00:00Z","22086569","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/22086569","","Waste Management","12","32"

Black-Right-Pointing-Pointer Core indicators are needed in order to quantify and evaluate them. Black-Right-Pointing-Pointer A systematic, step-by-step approach is developed in this study for their development. Black-Right-Pointing-Pointer Transport may play a significant role in terms of environmental and economic costs. Black-Right-Pointing-Pointer Policy action is required in order to advance in the consecution of these principles. - Abstract: In this paper, the material and spatial characterization of the flows within a municipal solid waste (MSW) management system are combined through a Network-Based Spatial Material Flow Analysis. Using this information, two core indicators are developed for the bio-waste fraction, the Net Recovery Index (NRI) and the Transport Intensity Index (TII), which are aimed at assessing progress towards policy-related sustainable MSW management strategies and objectives. The NRI approaches the capacity of a MSW management system for converting waste into resources through a systematic metabolic approach, whereas the TII addresses efficiency in terms of the transport requirements to manage a specific waste flow throughout the entire MSW management life cycle. Therefore, both indicators could be useful in assessing key MSW management policy strategies, such as the consecution of higher recycling levels (sustainability principle) or the minimization of transport by locating treatment facilities closer to generation sources (proximity principle). To apply this methodological approach, the bio-waste management system of the region of Catalonia (Spain) has been chosen as a case study. Results show the adequacy of both indicators for identifying those points within the system with higher capacity to compromise its environmental, economic and social performance and therefore establishing clear targets for policy prioritization. Moreover, this methodological approach permits scenario building, which could be useful in assessing the outcomes of hypothetical scenarios, thus proving its adequacy for strategic planning.","","Available from http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.wasman.2012.06.010","","","","United States","2012-12-15T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: Waste Management; Journal Volume: 32; Journal Issue: 12; Other Information: Copyright (c) 2012 Elsevier Science B.V., Amsterdam, The Netherlands, All rights reserved.; Country of input: International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA)","","Medium: X; Size: page(s) 2496-2510","","","","Journal ID: ISSN 0956-053X; CODEN: WAMAE2; PII: S0956-053X(12)00280-2; TRN: US13R2110045009","10.1016/J.WASMAN.2012.06.010","","2013-05-17T00:00:00Z","22086571","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/22086571","","Waste Management","12","32"

Black-Right-Pointing-Pointer This note is a compendium of a study on the potential for GHG control via improved zero waste in Africa. Black-Right-Pointing-Pointer This study provides the framework for Local Authorities for realizing sustained GHG reductions. - Abstract: Greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions per person from urban waste management activities are greater in sub-Saharan African countries than in other developing countries, and are increasing as the population becomes more urbanised. Waste from urban areas across Africa is essentially dumped on the ground and there is little control over the resulting gas emissions. The clean development mechanism (CDM), from the 1997 Kyoto Protocol has been the vehicle to initiate projects to control GHG emissions in Africa. However, very few of these projects have been implemented and properly registered. A much more efficient and cost effective way to control GHG emissions from waste is to stabilise the waste via composting and to use the composted material as a soil improver/organic fertiliser or as a component of growing media. Compost can be produced by open windrow or in-vessel composting plants. This paper shows that passively aerated open windrows constitute an appropriate low-cost option for African countries. However, to provide an usable compost material it is recommended that waste is processed through a materials recovery facility (MRF) before being composted. The paper demonstrates that material and biological treatment (MBT) are viable in Africa where they are funded, e.g. CDM. However, they are unlikely to be instigated unless there is a replacement to the Kyoto Protocol, which ceases for Registration in December 2012.","","Available from http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.wasman.2012.05.042","","","","United States","2012-12-15T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: Waste Management; Journal Volume: 32; Journal Issue: 12; Other Information: Copyright (c) 2012 Elsevier Science B.V., Amsterdam, The Netherlands, All rights reserved.; Country of input: International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA)","","Medium: X; Size: page(s) 2518-2525","","","","Journal ID: ISSN 0956-053X; CODEN: WAMAE2; PII: S0956-053X(12)00276-0; TRN: US13R2111045010","10.1016/J.WASMAN.2012.05.042","","2013-05-17T00:00:00Z","22086572","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/22086572","","Waste Management","12","32"

Two experimental approaches on nonradioactive glass specimens are implemented: pressurized helium infusion experiments and {sup 3}He ion implantation experiments. The temperature variation of helium solubility in SON68 glass was determined and analyzed with the harmonic oscillator model to determine values of the energy of interaction E(0) at the host sites (about -4000 J/mol), the vibration frequency (about 1.7 x 10{sup 11} s{sup -1}), and the density of solubility sites (2.2 x 10{sup 21} sites cm{sup -3}). The implantation experiments show that a non diffusive transport phenomenon (i.e., athermal diffusion) is involved in the material when the helium concentration exceeds 2.3 x 10{sup 21} He cm{sup -3}, and thus probably as soon as it exceeds the density of solubility sites accessible to helium in the glass. We propose that this transport mechanism could be associated with the relaxation of the stress gradient induced by the implanted helium profile, which is favored by the glass damage. Microstructural characterization by TEM and ESEM of glass specimens implanted with high helium concentrations showed a homogeneous microstructure free of bubbles, pores, or cracking at a scale of 10 nm.

For many years, Hanford staff has anecdotally noted that aluminum appears to be considerably more soluble in Hanford waste than the simpler electrolyte solutions used as analogues. There has been minimal scientific study to confirm these anecdotal observations, however. The present study determines the apparent solubility product for gibbsite in 50 tank samples. The ratio of hydroxide to aluminum in the liquid phase for the samples is calculated and plotted as a function of total sodium molarity. Total sodium molarity is used as a surrogate for ionic strength, because the relative ratios of mono, di and trivalent anions are not available for all of the samples. These results were compared to the simple NaOH-NaAl(OH{sub 4})H{sub 2}O system, and the NaOH-NaAl(OH{sub 4})NaCl-H{sub 2}O system data retrieved from the literature. The results show that gibbsite is apparently more soluble in the samples than in the simple systems whenever the sodium molarity is greater than two. This apparent enhanced solubility cannot be explained solely by differences in ionic strength. The change in solubility with ionic strength in simple systems is small compared to the difference between aluminum solubility in Hanford waste and the simple systems. The reason for the apparent enhanced solubility is unknown, but could include. kinetic or thermodynamic factors that are not present in the simple electrolyte systems. Any kinetic explanation would have to explain why the samples are always supersaturated whenever the sodium molarity is above two. Real waste characterization data should not be used to validate thermodynamic solubility models until it can be confirmed that the apparent enhanced gibbsite solubility is a thermodynamic effect and not a kinetic effect.","Taylor & Francis","","Hanford Site (HNF), Richland, WA (United States)","USDOE Office of Environmental Management (EM)","","United States","2012-12-01T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: Journal of environmental science and health.

The results showed that stable operation was achieved with organic loading rates (OLR) of 1.2-8.0 kg volatile solid (VS) (m{sup 3} d){sup -1}, with VS reduction rates of 61.7-69.9%, and volumetric biogas production of 0.89-5.28 m{sup 3} (m{sup 3} d){sup -1}. A maximum methane production rate of 2.94 m{sup 3} (m{sup 3} d){sup -1} was achieved at OLR of 8.0 kg VS (m{sup 3} d){sup -1} and hydraulic retention time of 15 days. With increasing OLRs, the anaerobic reactor showed a decrease in VS removal rate, average pH value and methane concentration, and a increase of volatile fatty acid concentration. By monitoring the biogas production rate (BPR), the anaerobic digestion system has a higher acidification risk under an OLR of 8.0 kg VS (m{sup 3} d){sup -1}. This result remarks the possibility of relating bioreactor performance with BPR in order to better understand and monitor anaerobic digestion process.","","Available from http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.wasman.2012.03.003","","","","United States","2012-11-15T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: Waste Management; Journal Volume: 32; Journal Issue: 11; Other Information: Copyright (c) 2012 Elsevier Science B.V., Amsterdam, The Netherlands, All rights reserved.; Country of input: International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA)","","Medium: X; Size: page(s) 2056-2060","","","","Journal ID: ISSN 0956-053X; CODEN: WAMAE2; PII: S0956-053X(12)00086-4; TRN: US13R2092048619","10.1016/J.WASMAN.2012.03.003","","2013-05-17T00:00:00Z","22089895","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/22089895","","Waste Management","11","32"

Fitting the data to the theoretical framework shows that there are only three constructs which have a significant effect on behaviour, viz experience, knowledge, and perceived behavioural control (PBC). Knowledge has a significant influence on all three of the antecedents to behavioural intention (attitude, subjective norm and PBC). However, it is PBC, and not intention, that has the greatest influence on waste behaviour. While respondents may have an intention to act, this intention does not always manifest as actual waste behaviour, suggesting limited volitional control. The theoretical framework accounts for 53.7% of the variance in behaviour, suggesting significant external influences on behaviour not accounted for in the framework. While the theoretical model remains the same, respondents in public and private organisations represent two statistically significant sub-groups in the data set. The theoretical framework accounts for 47.8% of the variance in behaviour of respondents in public waste organisations and 57.6% of the variance in behaviour of respondents in private organisations. The results suggest that respondents in public and private waste organisations are subject to different structural forces that shape knowledge, intention, and resultant waste behaviour.","","Available from http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.wasman.2012.05.018","","","","United States","2012-11-15T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: Waste Management; Journal Volume: 32; Journal Issue: 11; Other Information: Copyright (c) 2012 Elsevier Science B.V., Amsterdam, The Netherlands, All rights reserved.; Country of input: International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA)","","Medium: X; Size: page(s) 2163-2176","","","","Journal ID: ISSN 0956-053X; CODEN: WAMAE2; PII: S0956-053X(12)00227-9; TRN: US13R2096048621","10.1016/J.WASMAN.2012.05.018","","2013-05-17T00:00:00Z","22089897","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/22089897","","Waste Management","11","32"

Gastro-intestinal infections, respiratory and skin diseases as well as muscular-skeletal problems and cutting injuries are commonly found among waste workers around the globe. In order to find efficient, sustainable solutions to reduce occupational risks of waste workers, a methodological risk assessment has to be performed and counteractive measures have to be developed according to an internationally acknowledged hierarchy. From a case study in Addis Ababa, Ethiopia suggestions for the transferral of collected household waste into roadside containers are given. With construction of ramps to dump collected household waste straight into roadside containers and an adaptation of pushcarts and collection procedures, the risk is tackled at the source.","","Available from http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.wasman.2012.03.025","","","","United States","2012-11-15T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: Waste Management; Journal Volume: 32; Journal Issue: 11; Other Information: Copyright (c) 2012 Elsevier Science B.V., Amsterdam, The Netherlands, All rights reserved.; Country of input: International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA)","","Medium: X; Size: page(s) 2009-2017","","","","Journal ID: ISSN 0956-053X; CODEN: WAMAE2; PII: S0956-053X(12)00136-5; TRN: US13R2090045001","10.1016/J.WASMAN.2012.03.025","","2013-05-17T00:00:00Z","22086563","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/22086563","","Waste Management","11","32"

The waste hierarchy adopted by many African countries clearly shows that waste recycling and composting projects are generally the most sustainable. This paper undertakes a sustainability assessment for practical waste treatment and disposal scenarios for Africa and makes recommendations for consideration. The appraisal in this paper demonstrates that mechanical biological treatment of waste becomes more financially attractive if established through the CDM process. Waste will continue to be dumped in Africa with increasing greenhouse gas emissions produced, unless industrialised countries (Annex 1) fund carbon emission reduction schemes through a replacement to the Kyoto Protocol. Such a replacement should calculate all of the direct and indirect carbon emission savings and seek to promote public-private partnerships through a concerted support of the informal sector.","","Available from http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.wasman.2012.02.022","","","","United States","2012-11-15T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: Waste Management; Journal Volume: 32; Journal Issue: 11; Other Information: Copyright (c) 2012 Elsevier Science B.V., Amsterdam, The Netherlands, All rights reserved.; Country of input: International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA)","","Medium: X; Size: page(s) 2115-2125","","","","Journal ID: ISSN 0956-053X; CODEN: WAMAE2; PII: S0956-053X(12)00082-7; TRN: US13R2094045002","10.1016/J.WASMAN.2012.02.022","","2013-05-17T00:00:00Z","22086564","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/22086564","","Waste Management","11","32"

Black-Right-Pointing-Pointer Structured assessment of 'best practices' can enhance replication in other cities. - Abstract: According to most experts, integrated and sustainable solid waste management should not only be given top priority, but must go beyond technical aspects to include various key elements of sustainability to ensure success of any solid waste project. Aside from project sustainable impacts, the overall enabling environment is the key feature determining performance and success of an integrated and affordable solid waste system. This paper describes a project-specific approach to assess typical success or failure factors. A questionnaire-based assessment method covers issues of: (i) social mobilisation and acceptance (social element), (ii) stakeholder, legal and institutional arrangements comprising roles, responsibilities and management functions (institutional element); (iii) financial and operational requirements, as well as cost recovery mechanisms (economic element). The Gianyar Waste Recovery Project in Bali, Indonesia was analysed using this integrated assessment method. The results clearly identified chief characteristics, key factors to consider when planning country wide replication but also major barriers and obstacles which must be overcome to ensure project sustainability. The Gianyar project consists of a composting unit processing 60 tons of municipal waste per day from 500,000 inhabitants, including manual waste segregation and subsequent composting of the biodegradable organic fraction.","","Available from http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.wasman.2012.01.011","","","","United States","2012-11-15T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: Waste Management; Journal Volume: 32; Journal Issue: 11; Other Information: Copyright (c) 2012 Elsevier Science B.V., Amsterdam, The Netherlands, All rights reserved.; Country of input: International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA)","","Medium: X; Size: page(s) 2126-2133","","","","Journal ID: ISSN 0956-053X; CODEN: WAMAE2; PII: S0956-053X(12)00025-6; TRN: US13R2095045003","10.1016/J.WASMAN.2012.01.011","","2013-05-17T00:00:00Z","22086565","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/22086565","","Waste Management","11","32"

Black-Right-Pointing-Pointer We model the requirements of four clusters of plant owner/operators in China. Black-Right-Pointing-Pointer We examine the best technology fit for these requirements via a matrix. Black-Right-Pointing-Pointer Variance in waste input affects result more than training and costs. Black-Right-Pointing-Pointer For China technology adaptation and localisation could become push, not pull factors. - Abstract: Even though technology transfer has been part of development aid programmes for many decades, it has more often than not failed to come to fruition. One reason is the absence of simple guidelines or decision making tools that help operators or plant owners to decide on the most suitable technology to adopt. Practical suggestions for choosing the most suitable technology to combat a specific problem are hard to get and technology drawbacks are not sufficiently highlighted. Western counterparts in technology transfer or development projects often underestimate or don't sufficiently account for the high investment costs for the imported incineration plant; the differing nature of Chinese MSW; the need for trained manpower; and the need to treat flue gas, bunker leakage water, and ash, all of which contain highly toxic elements. This article sets out requirements for municipal solid waste disposal plant owner/operators in China as well as giving an attribute assessment for the prevalent waste disposal plant types in order to assist individual decision makers in their evaluation process for what plant type might be most suitable in a given situation. There is no 'best' plant for all needs and purposes, and requirement constellations rely on generalisations meaning they cannot be blindly applied, but an alignment of a type of plant to a type of owner or operator can realistically be achieved. To this end, a four-step approach is suggested and a technology matrix is set out to ease the choice of technology to transfer and avoid past errors. The four steps are (1) Identification of plant owner/operator requirement clusters; (2) Determination of different municipal solid waste (MSW) treatment plant attributes; (3) Development of a matrix matching requirement clusters to plant attributes; (4) Application of Quality Function Deployment Method to aid in technology localisation. The technology transfer matrices thus derived show significant performance differences between the various technologies available. It is hoped that the resulting research can build a bridge between technology transfer research and waste disposal research in order to enhance the exchange of more sustainable solutions in future.","","Available from http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.wasman.2012.05.038","","","","United States","2012-11-15T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: Waste Management; Journal Volume: 32; Journal Issue: 11; Other Information: Copyright (c) 2012 Elsevier Science B.V., Amsterdam, The Netherlands, All rights reserved.; Country of input: International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA)","","Medium: X; Size: page(s) 2177-2184","","","","Journal ID: ISSN 0956-053X; CODEN: WAMAE2; PII: S0956-053X(12)00249-8; TRN: US13R2097045004","10.1016/J.WASMAN.2012.05.038","","2013-05-17T00:00:00Z","22086566","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/22086566","","Waste Management","11","32"

Black-Right-Pointing-Pointer Local conditions characteristics and constraints are often neglected. Black-Right-Pointing-Pointer We developed an economic model able to compare multi-level waste management options. Black-Right-Pointing-Pointer A detailed test case with real economic data and a best-fit scenario is described. Black-Right-Pointing-Pointer Most efficient schemes combine clear National directives with local level flexibility. - Abstract: As environmental awareness rises, integrated solid waste management (WM) schemes are increasingly being implemented all over the world. The different WM schemes usually address issues such as landfilling restrictions (mainly due to methane emissions and competing land use), packaging directives and compulsory recycling goals. These schemes are, in general, designed at a national or regional level, whereas local conditions and constraints are sometimes neglected. When national WM top-down policies, in addition to setting goals, also dictate the methods by which they are to be achieved, local authorities lose their freedom to optimize their operational WM schemes according to their specific characteristics. There are a myriad of implementation options at the local level, and by carrying out a bottom-up approach the overall national WM system will be optimal on economic and environmental scales. This paper presents a model for optimizing waste strategies at a local level and evaluates this effect at a national level. This is achieved by using a waste assessment model which enables us to compare both the economic viability of several WM options at the local (single municipal authority) level, and aggregated results for regional or national levels. A test case based on various WM approaches in Israel (several implementations of mixed and separated waste) shows that local characteristics significantly influence WM costs, and therefore the optimal scheme is one under which each local authority is able to implement its best-fitting mechanism, given that national guidelines are kept. The main result is that strict national/regional WM policies may be less efficient, unless some type of local flexibility is implemented. Our model is designed both for top-down and bottom-up assessment, and can be easily adapted for a wide range of WM option comparisons at different levels.","","Available from http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.wasman.2012.05.023","","","","United States","2012-10-15T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: Waste Management; Journal Volume: 32; Journal Issue: 10; Other Information: Copyright (c) 2012 Elsevier Science B.V., Amsterdam, The Netherlands, All rights reserved.; Country of input: International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA)","","Medium: X; Size: page(s) 1979-1988","","","","Journal ID: ISSN 0956-053X; CODEN: WAMAE2; PII: S0956-053X(12)00232-2; TRN: US13R2089048617","10.1016/J.WASMAN.2012.05.023","","2013-05-17T00:00:00Z","22089893","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/22089893","","Waste Management","10","32"
"Environmental sustainability comparison of a hypothetical pneumatic waste collection system and a door-to-door system","Punkkinen, Henna; Merta, Elina; Teerioja, Nea; Moliis, Katja; Kuvaja, Eveliina","54 ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCES; 12 MANAGEMENT OF RADIOACTIVE WASTES, AND NON-RADIOACTIVE WASTES FROM NUCLEAR FACILITIES; AIR POLLUTION; CONTAINERS; ENVIRONMENTAL IMPACTS; FINLAND; GREENHOUSE GASES; INVENTORIES; LIFE CYCLE; MUNICIPAL WASTES; NITROGEN OXIDES; PNEUMATIC TRANSPORT; SULFUR DIOXIDE; URBAN AREAS; WASTE MANAGEMENT","Highlights: Black-Right-Pointing-Pointer We compare the environmental sustainability of two MSW collection systems. Black-Right-Pointing-Pointer We evaluate pneumatic and door-to-door collection systems. Black-Right-Pointing-Pointer The greenhouse gas emissions of pneumatic collection are around three times higher. Black-Right-Pointing-Pointer System components are decisive but assumptions on electricity use are also important. Black-Right-Pointing-Pointer Pneumatic collection could provide other benefits over door-to-door system. - Abstract: Waste collection is one of the life cycle phases that influence the environmental sustainability of waste management. Pneumatic waste collection systems represent a new way of arranging waste collection in densely populated urban areas. However, limited information is available on the environmental impacts of this system. In this study, we compare the environmental sustainability of conventional door-to-door waste collection with its hypothetical pneumatic alternative. Furthermore, we analyse whether the size of the hypothetical pneumatic system, or the number of waste fractions included, have an impact on the results. Environmental loads are calculated for a hypothetical pneumatic waste collection system modelled on an existing dense urban area in Helsinki, Finland, and the results are compared to those of the prevailing, container-based, door-to-door waste collection system. The evaluation method used is the life-cycle inventory (LCI). In this study, we report the atmospheric emissions of greenhouse gases (GHG), SO{sub 2} and NO{sub x}. The results indicate that replacing the prevailing system with stationary pneumatic waste collection in an existing urban infrastructure would increase total air emissions. Locally, in the waste collection area, emissions would nonetheless diminish, as collection traffic decreases. While the electricity consumption of the hypothetical pneumatic system and the origin of electricity have a significant bearing on the results, emissions due to manufacturing the system's components prove decisive.","","Available from http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.wasman.2012.05.003","","","","United States","2012-10-15T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: Waste Management; Journal Volume: 32; Journal Issue: 10; Other Information: Copyright (c) 2012 Elsevier Science B.V., Amsterdam, The Netherlands, All rights reserved.; Country of input: International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA)","","Medium: X; Size: page(s) 1775-1781","","","","Journal ID: ISSN 0956-053X; CODEN: WAMAE2; PII: S0956-053X(12)00193-6; TRN: US13R2077044994","10.1016/J.WASMAN.2012.05.003","","2013-05-17T00:00:00Z","22086556","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/22086556","","Waste Management","10","32"

Black-Right-Pointing-Pointer Economic potential for new recycling technologies quantified for several metrics. Black-Right-Pointing-Pointer Indicators developed for materials incurring high eco-toxicity costs. Black-Right-Pointing-Pointer Methodology useful for a variety of stakeholders, particularly policy-makers. - Abstract: The increasing growth in generation of electronic waste (e-waste) motivates a variety of waste reduction research. Printed circuit boards (PCBs) are an important sub-set of the overall e-waste stream due to the high value of the materials contained within them and potential toxicity. This work explores several environmental and economic metrics for prioritizing the recovery of materials from end-of-life PCBs. A weighted sum model is used to investigate the trade-offs among economic value, energy saving potentials, and eco-toxicity. Results show that given equal weights for these three sustainability criteria gold has the highest recovery priority, followed by copper, palladium, aluminum, tin, lead, platinum, nickel, zinc, and silver. However, recovery priority will change significantly due to variation in the composition of PCBs, choice of ranking metrics, and weighting factors when scoring multiple metrics. These results can be used by waste management decision-makers to quantify the value and environmental savings potential for recycling technology development and infrastructure. They can also be extended by policy-makers to inform possible penalties for land-filling PCBs or exporting to the informal recycling sector. The importance of weighting factors when examining recovery trade-offs, particularly for policies regarding PCB collection and recycling are explored further.","","Available from http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.wasman.2012.05.005","","","","United States","2012-10-15T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: Waste Management; Journal Volume: 32; Journal Issue: 10; Other Information: Copyright (c) 2012 Elsevier Science B.V., Amsterdam, The Netherlands, All rights reserved.; Country of input: International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA)","","Medium: X; Size: page(s) 1903-1913","","","","Journal ID: ISSN 0956-053X; CODEN: WAMAE2; PII: S0956-053X(12)00195-X; TRN: US13R2083044997","10.1016/J.WASMAN.2012.05.005","","2013-05-17T00:00:00Z","22086559","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/22086559","","Waste Management","10","32"

This paper aims to describe the application of life cycle assessment (LCA) to investigate the environmental performance of Chinese TV sets. An assessment of the TV set device (focusing on the Cathode Ray Tube (CRT) monitor) was carried out using a detailed modular LCA based on the international standards of the ISO 14040 series. The LCA was constructed using SimaPro software version 7.2 and expressed with the Eco-indicator' 99 life cycle impact assessment method. For a sensitivity analysis of the overall LCA results, the CML method was used in order to estimate the influence of the choice of the assessment method on the results. Life cycle inventory information was compiled by Ecoinvent 2.2 databases, combined with literature and field investigations on the current Chinese situation. The established LCA study shows that the use stage of such devices has the highest environmental impact, followed by the manufacturing stage. In the manufacturing stage, the CRT and the Printed Circuit Board (PCB) are those components contributing the most environmental impacts. During the use phase, the environmental impacts are due entirely to the methods of electricity generation used to run them, since no other aspects were taken into account for this phase. The final processing step-the end-of-life stage-can lead to a clear environmental benefit when the TV sets are processed through the formal dismantling enterprises in China.","","Available from http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.wasman.2012.05.007","","","","United States","2012-10-15T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: Waste Management; Journal Volume: 32; Journal Issue: 10; Other Information: Copyright (c) 2012 Elsevier Science B.V., Amsterdam, The Netherlands, All rights reserved.; Country of input: International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA)","","Medium: X; Size: page(s) 1926-1936","","","","Journal ID: ISSN 0956-053X; CODEN: WAMAE2; PII: S0956-053X(12)00197-3; TRN: US13R2085044998","10.1016/J.WASMAN.2012.05.007","","2013-05-17T00:00:00Z","22086560","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/22086560","","Waste Management","10","32"

Black-Right-Pointing-Pointer Experimental data on the leaching capacity for indium and the electricity consumption of equipment were inputted into the LCA model in order to compare the environmental performance of each method. Black-Right-Pointing-Pointer An estimate for the environmental performance was calculated as the sum of six impact categories. Black-Right-Pointing-Pointer Electrical disintegration method outperforms conventional grinding in all impact categories. - Abstract: In order to develop an effective recycling system for obsolete Liquid Crystal Displays (LCDs), which would enable both the leaching of indium (In) and the recovery of a pure glass fraction for recycling, an effective liberation or size-reduction method would be an important pre-treatment step. Therefore, in this study, two different types of liberation methods: (1) conventional grinding, and (2) electrical disintegration have been tested and evaluated in the context of Life Cycle Assessment (LCA). In other words, the above-mentioned methods were compared in order to find out the one that ensures the highest leaching capacity for indium, as well as the lowest environmental burden. One of the main findings of this study was that the electrical disintegration was the most effective liberation method, since it fully liberated the indium containing-layer, ensuring a leaching capacity of 968.5 mg-In/kg-LCD. In turn, the estimate for the environmental burden was approximately five times smaller when compared with the conventional grinding.","","Available from http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.wasman.2012.05.016","","","","United States","2012-10-15T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: Waste Management; Journal Volume: 32; Journal Issue: 10; Other Information: Copyright (c) 2012 Elsevier Science B.V., Amsterdam, The Netherlands, All rights reserved.; Country of input: International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA)","","Medium: X; Size: page(s) 1937-1944","","","","Journal ID: ISSN 0956-053X; CODEN: WAMAE2; PII: S0956-053X(12)00225-5; TRN: US13R2086044999","10.1016/J.WASMAN.2012.05.016","","2013-05-17T00:00:00Z","22086561","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/22086561","","Waste Management","10","32"

E.","12 MANAGEMENT OF RADIOACTIVE AND NON-RADIOACTIVE WASTES FROM NUCLEAR FACILITIES; Ion-exchange; cesium removal; spherical resins; process modeling; radioactive waste","The spherical Resorcinol-Formaldehyde and hypothetical spherical SuperLig(r) 644 ion-exchange resins are evaluated for cesium removal from radioactive waste solutions. Modeling results show that spherical SuperLig(r) 644 reduces column cycling by 50% for high-potassium solutions. Spherical Resorcinol Formaldehyde performs equally well for the lowest-potassium wastes. Less cycling reduces nitric acid usage during resin elution and sodium addition during resin regeneration, therefore, significantly decreasing life-cycle operational costs. A model assessment of the mechanism behind ''cesium bleed'' is also conducted. When a resin bed is eluted, a relatively small amount of cesium remains within resin particles. Cesium can bleed into otherwise decontaminated product in the next loading cycle. The bleed mechanism is shown to be fully isotherm-controlled vs. mass transfer controlled. Knowledge of residual post-elution cesium level and resin isotherm can be utilized to predict rate of cesium bleed in a mostly non-loaded column. Overall, this work demonstrates the versatility of the ion-exchange modeling to study the effects of resin characteristics on processing cycles, rates, and cold chemical consumption. This evaluation justifies further development of a spherical form of the SL644 resin.","","","Savannah River Site (SRS), Aiken, SC (United States)","USDOE (United States)","","United States","2012-09-19T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: Separation Science and Technology","","Medium: ED; Size: 32 p.","","SRNL-STI-2012-00575","DE-AC09-08SR22470","TRN: US1400094","","","2014-04-03T00:00:00Z","1096411","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/1096411","https://www.osti.gov/servlets/purl/1096411","Separation Science and Technology","",""

This innovative method has promise for the nuclear industry's processing technologies, environmental protection, and safeguards.","","available","Savannah River Site (SRS), Aiken, SC (United States)","USDOE","","United States","2012-09-11T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: Innovation, America's Journal of Technology Commercialization","","Medium: ED","","SRNL-MS-2012-00162REV1","DE-AC09-08SR22470","TRN: US1204842","","","2012-12-05T00:00:00Z","1050616","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/1050616","https://www.osti.gov/servlets/purl/1050616","Innovation, America's Journal of Technology Commercialization","",""
"The Start Of Ebullition In Quiescent, Yield-Stress Fluids","Reed, G. R.; Sherwood, David J.; Saez, A. Eduardo","12 MANAGEMENT OF RADIOACTIVE AND NON-RADIOACTIVE WASTES FROM NUCLEAR FACILITIES; Yield stress fluid; Bubble enlargement; Coalescence; Ebullition","Non-Newtonian rheology is typical for the high-level radioactive waste (HLW) slurries processed in the Hanford Tank Waste Treatment and Immobilization Plant (WTP). Hydrogen and other flammable gases are generated in the aqueous phase by radiolytic and chemical reactions. HLW slurries have a capacity for retaining gas characterized by the shear strength holding the bubbles still. The sizes and degassing characteristics of flammable gas bubbles in the HLW slurries expected to be processed by the WTP are important considerations for designing equipment and operating procedures. Slurries become increasingly susceptible to degassing as the bubble concentration increases. This susceptibility and the process of ebullitive bubble enlargement are described here. When disturbed, the fluid undergoes localized flow around neighboring bubbles which are dragged together and coalesce, producing an enlarged bubble. For the conditions considered in this work, bubble size increase is enough to displace the weight required to overcome the fluid shear strength and yield the surroundings. The buoyant bubble ascends and accumulates others within a zone of influence, enlarging by a few orders of magnitude. This process describes how the first bubbles appear on the surface of a 7 Pa shear strength fluid a few seconds after being jarred.","","","Hanford Site (HNF), Richland, WA (United States)","USDOE Office of Environmental Management (EM) (United States)","","United States","2012-08-30T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: JOURNAL OF RHEOLOGICA ACTA SPRINGER SCIENCE AND BUSINESS MEDIA","","Medium: ED; Size: 37 p.","","ORP-52762 Rev 0","DE-AC06-09RL14728","TRN: US1300302","","","2014-10-10T00:00:00Z","1053812","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/1053812","https://www.osti.gov/servlets/purl/1053812","JOURNAL OF RHEOLOGICA ACTA SPRINGER SCIENCE AND BUSINESS MEDIA","",""
"Crystal-Tolerant Glass Approach For Mitigation Of Crystal Accumulation In Continuous Melters Processing Radioactive Waste","Kruger, Albert A.; Rodriguez, Carmen P.; Lang, Jesse B.; Huckleberry, Adam R.; Matyas, Josef; Owen, Antoinette T.","12 MANAGEMENT OF RADIOACTIVE AND NON-RADIOACTIVE WASTES FROM NUCLEAR FACILITIES; High-level waste; Vitrification; Melter; Spinel crystals; Accumulation; Empirical model; Agglomeration; Liquidus temperature; Crystal-tolerant glass","High-level radioactive waste melters are projected to operate in an inefficient manner as they are subjected to artificial constraints, such as minimum liquidus temperature (T{sub L}) or maximum equilibrium fraction of crystallinity at a given temperature. These constraints substantially limit waste loading, but were imposed to prevent clogging of the melter with spinel crystals [(Fe, Ni, Mn, Zn)(Fe, Cr){sub 2}O{sub 4}]. In the melter, the glass discharge riser is the most likely location for crystal accumulation during idling because of low glass temperatures, stagnant melts, and small diameter. To address this problem, a series of lab-scale crucible tests were performed with specially formulated glasses to simulate accumulation of spinel in the riser. Thicknesses of accumulated layers were incorporated into empirical model of spinel settling. In addition, T{sub L} of glasses was measured and impact of particle agglomeration on accumulation rate was evaluated. Empirical model predicted well the accumulation of single crystals and/or smallscale agglomerates, but, excessive agglomeration observed in high-Ni-Fe glass resulted in an under-prediction of accumulated layers, which gradually worsen over time as an increased number of agglomerates formed. Accumulation rate of ~14.9 +- 1 nm/s determined for this glass will result in ~26 mm thick layer in 20 days of melter idling.","","","Hanford Site (HNF), Richland, WA (United States)","USDOE Office of Environmental Management (EM) (United States)","","United States","2012-08-28T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: Journal Of The American Ceramic Society","","Medium: ED; Size: 59 p.","","ORP-52717 Rev 0","DE-AC06-09RL14728","TRN: US1300301","","","2014-04-03T00:00:00Z","1053811","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/1053811","https://www.osti.gov/servlets/purl/1053811","Journal Of The American Ceramic Society","",""

Black-Right-Pointing-Pointer Academic initiatives and the necessary expansion of novel product markets are discussed. - Abstract: Cathode Ray Tube, CRT, waste glass recycling has plagued glass manufacturers, electronics recyclers and electronics waste policy makers for decades because the total supply of waste glass exceeds demand, and the formulations of CRT glass are ill suited for most reuse options. The solutions are to separate the undesirable components (e.g. lead oxide) in the waste and create demand for new products. Achieving this is no simple feat, however, as there are many obstacles: limited knowledge of waste glass composition; limited automation in the recycling process; transportation of recycled material; and a weak and underdeveloped market. Thus one of the main goals of this paper is to advise electronic glass recyclers on how to best manage a diverse supply of glass waste and successfully market to end users. Further, this paper offers future directions for academic and industry research. To develop the recommendations offered here, a combination of approaches were used: (1) a thorough study of historic trends in CRT glass chemistry; (2) bulk glass collection and analysis of cullet from a large-scale glass recycler; (3) conversations with industry members and a review of potential applications; and (4) evaluation of the economic viability of specific uses for recycled CRT glass. If academia and industry can solve these problems (for example by creating a database of composition organized by manufacturer and glass source) then the reuse of CRT glass can be increased.","","Available from http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.wasman.2012.03.004","","","","United States","2012-08-15T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: Waste Management; Journal Volume: 32; Journal Issue: 8; Other Information: DOI: 10.1016/j.wasman.2012.03.004; PII: S0956-053X(12)00087-6; Copyright (c) 2012 Elsevier Science B.V., Amsterdam, The Netherlands, All rights reserved.; Country of input: International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA)","","Medium: X; Size: page(s) 1560-1565","","","","Journal ID: ISSN 0956-053X; WAMAE2; TRN: US12R4070091657","10.1016/j.wasman.2012.03.004","","2012-12-11T00:00:00Z","21613003","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/21613003","","Waste Management","8","32"

Black-Right-Pointing-Pointer The estimation of lifespan distribution is based on large sample of EoL mobile phones. Black-Right-Pointing-Pointer Total lifespan of Czech mobile phones is surprisingly long, exactly 7.99 years. Black-Right-Pointing-Pointer In the years 2010-20, about 26.3 million pieces of EoL mobile phones will be generated in the Czech Republic. - Abstract: The volume of waste electrical and electronic equipment (WEEE) has been rapidly growing in recent years. In the European Union (EU), legislation promoting the collection and recycling of WEEE has been in force since the year 2003. Yet, both current and recently suggested collection targets for WEEE are completely ineffective when it comes to collection and recycling of small WEEE (s-WEEE), with mobile phones as a typical example. Mobile phones are the most sold EEE and at the same time one of appliances with the lowest collection rate. To improve this situation, it is necessary to assess the amount of generated end of life (EoL) mobile phones as precisely as possible. This paper presents a method of assessment of EoL mobile phones generation based on delay model. Within the scope of this paper, the method has been applied on the Czech Republic data. However, this method can be applied also to other EoL appliances in or outside the Czech Republic. Our results show that the average total lifespan of Czech mobile phones is surprisingly long, exactly 7.99 years. We impute long lifespan particularly to a storage time of EoL mobile phones at households, estimated to be 4.35 years. In the years 1990-2000, only 45 thousands of EoL mobile phones were generated in the Czech Republic, while in the years 2000-2010 the number grew to 6.5 million pieces and it is estimated that in the years 2010-2020 about 26.3 million pieces will be generated. Current European legislation sets targets on collection and recycling of WEEE in general, but no specific collection target for EoL mobile phone exists. In the year 2010 only about 3-6% of Czech EoL mobile phones were collected for recovery and recycling. If we make similar estimation using an estimated average EU value, then within the next 10 years about 1.3 billion of EoL mobile phones would be available for recycling in the EU. This amount contains about 31 tonnes of gold and 325 tonnes of silver. Since Europe is dependent on import of many raw materials, efficient recycling of EoL products could help reduce this dependence. To set a working system of collection, it will be necessary to set new and realistic collection targets.","","Available from http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.wasman.2012.03.028","","","","United States","2012-08-15T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: Waste Management; Journal Volume: 32; Journal Issue: 8; Other Information: DOI: 10.1016/j.wasman.2012.03.028; PII: S0956-053X(12)00139-0; Copyright (c) 2012 Elsevier Science B.V., Amsterdam, The Netherlands, All rights reserved.; Country of input: International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA)","","Medium: X; Size: page(s) 1583-1591","","","","Journal ID: ISSN 0956-053X; WAMAE2; TRN: US12R4072091659","10.1016/j.wasman.2012.03.028","","2012-12-11T00:00:00Z","21613005","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/21613005","","Waste Management","8","32"

In Brazil, the new National Policy on Solid Wastes has prompted discussion on the future of electronic waste (e-waste). Over the last 10 years, different e-waste collection systems and recycling processes have been applied globally. This paper presents the systems used in different countries and compares the world situation to the current Brazilian reality. To establish a recycling process, it is necessary to organize efficient collection management. The main difficulty associated with the implementation of e-waste recycling processes in Brazil is the collection system, as its efficiency depends not only on the education and cooperation of the people but also on cooperation among industrial waste generators, distributors and the government. Over half a million waste pickers have been reported in Brazil and they are responsible for the success of metal scrap collection in the country. The country also has close to 2400 companies and cooperatives involved in recycling and scrap trading. On the other hand, the collection and recycling of e-waste is still incipient because e-wastes are not seen as valuable in the informal sector. The Brazilian challenge is therefore to organize a system of e-waste management including the informal sector without neglecting environmentally sound management principles.","","Available from http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.wasman.2012.04.003","","","","United States","2012-08-15T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: Waste Management; Journal Volume: 32; Journal Issue: 8; Other Information: DOI: 10.1016/j.wasman.2012.04.003; PII: S0956-053X(12)00145-6; Copyright (c) 2012 Elsevier Science B.V., Amsterdam, The Netherlands, All rights reserved.; Country of input: International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA)","","Medium: X; Size: page(s) 1592-1610","","","","Journal ID: ISSN 0956-053X; WAMAE2; TRN: US12R4073091660","10.1016/j.wasman.2012.04.003","","2012-12-11T00:00:00Z","21613006","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/21613006","","Waste Management","8","32"

In this system and beyond the solubility limit, rare-earths (RE) elements are reported to form apatite phases with the general formula Ca{sub 2}RE{sub 8}(SiO{sub 4}){sub 6}O{sub 2}. In the current study, speciation of these trivalent RE{sup 3+} cations in both amorphous network and crystal phases was determined from X-ray diffraction, scanning electron microscopy, optical absorption at 10 K, Raman spectroscopy, and electron probe microanalysis. It appeared that RE{sub 2}O{sub 3} solubility was higher for La -rich formulations than for Nd -rich ones and that an increase in the RE oxide content reduces the connectivity of the network building units through formation of non-bridging oxygens at the expense of the oxygen bridges. This depolymerization of the glass network did not affect neodymium environment which consisted in silicate tetrahedra. The composition of the apatite crystals was found to be affected by the La /(La + Nd) of the parent glass and deviation from the ideal composition (Ca{sub 2}RE{sub 8}(SiO{sub 4}){sub 6}O{sub 2}) occurred in the neodymium end of the system. It thus appears that both RE{sub 2}O{sub 3} solubility and crystal composition are strongly dependent on the type and crystal chemistry of the RE elements.

At the Hanford site in Washington State in the U.S., the total amount of 99Tc in low-activity waste (LAW) is {approx} 1,300 kg and the current strategy is to immobilize the 99Tc in borosilicate glass with vitrification. In this context, the present article reports on the solubility and retention of rhenium, a nonradioactive surrogate for 99Tc, in a LAW sodium borosilicate glass. Due to the radioactive nature of technetium, rhenium was chosen as a simulant because of previously established similarities in ionic radii and other chemical aspects. The glasses containing target Re concentrations varying from 0 to10,000 ppm by mass were synthesized in vacuum-sealed quartz ampoules to minimize the loss of Re by volatilization during melting at 1000 DC. The rhenium was found to be present predominantly as Re7 + in all the glasses as observed by X-ray absorption near-edge structure (XANES). The solubility of Re in borosilicate glasses was determined to be {approx}3,000 ppm (by mass) using inductively coupled plasma-optical emission spectroscopy (ICP-OES). At higher rhenium concentrations, some additional material was retained in the glasses in the form of alkali perrhenate crystalline inclusions detected by X-ray diffraction (XRD) and laser ablation-ICP mass spectrometry (LA-ICP-MS). Assuming justifiably substantial similarities between Re7 + and Tc 7+ behavior in this glass system, these results implied that the processing and immobilization of 99Tc from radioactive wastes should not be limited by the solubility of 99Tc in borosilicate LAW glasses.","","","Hanford Site (HNF), Richland, WA (United States)","USDOE Office of Environmental Management (EM)","","United States","2012-08-13T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: PRE-PUBLICATION ARTICLE TO JOURNAL OF MATERIALS CHEMISTRY, ROYAL SOCIETY OF CHEMISTRY","","Medium: ED","","ORP-52758-00","DE-AC27-08RV14800","TRN: US1204529","","","2014-10-10T00:00:00Z","1050037","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/1050037","https://www.osti.gov/servlets/purl/1050037","PRE-PUBLICATION ARTICLE TO JOURNAL OF MATERIALS CHEMISTRY, ROYAL SOCIETY OF CHEMISTRY","",""

The design of a waste management system consists in various activities, and one of these is related to the location of waste collection sites. In this paper, we propose an integer programming model that helps decision makers in choosing the sites where to locate the unsorted waste collection bins in a residential town, as well as the capacities of the bins to be located at each collection site. This model helps in assessing tactical decisions through constraints that force each collection area to be capacitated enough to fit the expected waste to be directed to that area, while taking into account Quality of Service constraints from the citizens' point of view. Moreover, we propose an effective constructive heuristic approach whose aim is to provide a good solution quality in an extremely reduced computational time. Computational results on data related to the city of Nardo, in the south of Italy, show that both exact and heuristic approaches provide consistently better solutions than that currently implemented, resulting in a lower number of activated collection sites, and a lower number of bins to be used.","","Available from http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.wasman.2012.02.009","","","","United States","2012-07-15T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: Waste Management; Journal Volume: 32; Journal Issue: 7; Other Information: DOI: 10.1016/j.wasman.2012.02.009; PII: S0956-053X(12)00069-4; Copyright (c) 2012 Elsevier Science B.V., Amsterdam, The Netherlands, All rights reserved.; Country of input: International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA)","","Medium: X; Size: page(s) 1291-1296","","","","Journal ID: ISSN 0956-053X; WAMAE2; TRN: US12R4054091642","10.1016/j.wasman.2012.02.009","","2012-12-11T00:00:00Z","21612988","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/21612988","","Waste Management","7","32"

Black-Right-Pointing-Pointer Temperature influences on the degradation of the studied compounds. Black-Right-Pointing-Pointer Overall, the LAS degradation is faster than the NP compounds degradation. Black-Right-Pointing-Pointer Therefore, the LAS presented lower environmental risk than the NP compounds. - Abstract: In this work, the degradation of anionic and non-ionic surfactants in agricultural soil amended with sewage sludge is reported. The compounds analysed were: linear alkylbenzene sulphonates (LAS) with a 10-13 carbon alkylic chain, and nonylphenolic compounds (NPE), including nonylphenol (NP) and nonylphenol ethoxylates with one and two ethoxy groups (NP1EO and NP2EO). The degradation studies were carried out under winter (12.7 Degree-Sign C) and summer (22.4 Degree-Sign C) conditions in Andalusia region. The concentration of LAS was reduced to 2% of the initial concentration 100 day after sludge-application to the soil. The half-life time measured for LAS homologues were ranged between 4 and 14 days at 12.7 Degree-Sign C and between 4 and 7 days at 22.4 Degree-Sign C. With regard to NPE compounds, after 8 and 4 days from the beginning of the experiment at 12.7 and 22.4 Degree-Sign C, respectively, their concentration levels were increased to 6.5 and 13.5 mg/kg dm (dry matter) as consequence of the degradation of nonylphenol polyethoxylates. These concentration levels were reduced to 5% after 63 and 70 days for 12.7 Degree-Sign C and 22.4 Degree-Sign C, respectively. The half-life times measured for NPEs were from 8 to 16 days at 12.7 Degree-Sign C and from 8 to 18 days at 22.4 Degree-Sign C. Environmental risk assessment revealed that for LAS homologues no environment risk could be expected after 7 and 8 days of sludge application to the soil for 22.4 and 12.7 Degree-Sign C, respectively; however, potential toxic effects could be observed for the nonylphenolic compounds during the first 56 days after sludge application to the soil.","","Available from http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.wasman.2012.02.023","","","","United States","2012-07-15T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: Waste Management; Journal Volume: 32; Journal Issue: 7; Other Information: DOI: 10.1016/j.wasman.2012.02.023; PII: S0956-053X(12)00085-2; Copyright (c) 2012 Elsevier Science B.V., Amsterdam, The Netherlands, All rights reserved.; Country of input: International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA)","","Medium: X; Size: page(s) 1324-1331","","","","Journal ID: ISSN 0956-053X; WAMAE2; TRN: US12R4056091644","10.1016/j.wasman.2012.02.023","","2012-12-11T00:00:00Z","21612990","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/21612990","","Waste Management","7","32"
"An integrated analytical framework for quantifying the LCOE of waste-to-energy facilities for a range of greenhouse gas emissions policy and technical factors","Townsend, Aaron K., E-mail: aarontownsend@utexas.edu; Webber, Michael E","54 ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCES; 12 MANAGEMENT OF RADIOACTIVE WASTES, AND NON-RADIOACTIVE WASTES FROM NUCLEAR FACILITIES; CARBON SEQUESTRATION; COST; ECONOMICS; EMISSION; ENERGY FACILITIES; ENVIRONMENTAL POLICY; FOOD; GLASS; GREENHOUSE GASES; LANDFILL GAS; METALS; PLASTICS; REGULATIONS; SANITARY LANDFILLS; WASTES; WOOD; AIR POLLUTION CONTROL; CONTROL; ELEMENTS; ENERGY SOURCES; FLUIDS; FUEL GAS; FUELS; GAS FUELS; GASES; GOVERNMENT POLICIES; LAWS; MANAGEMENT; MATERIALS; ORGANIC COMPOUNDS; ORGANIC POLYMERS; PETROCHEMICALS; PETROLEUM PRODUCTS; POLLUTION CONTROL; POLYMERS; SEPARATION PROCESSES; SYNTHETIC MATERIALS; WASTE DISPOSAL; WASTE MANAGEMENT","This study presents a novel integrated method for considering the economics of waste-to-energy (WTE) facilities with priced greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions based upon technical and economic characteristics of the WTE facility, MSW stream, landfill alternative, and GHG emissions policy. The study demonstrates use of the formulation for six different policy scenarios and explores sensitivity of the results to ranges of certain technical parameters as found in existing literature. The study shows that details of the GHG emissions regulations have large impact on the levelized cost of energy (LCOE) of WTE and that GHG regulations can either increase or decrease the LCOE of WTE depending on policy choices regarding biogenic fractions from combusted waste and emissions from landfills. Important policy considerations are the fraction of the carbon emissions that are priced (i.e. all emissions versus only non-biogenic emissions), whether emissions credits are allowed due to reducing fugitive landfill gas emissions, whether biogenic carbon sequestration in landfills is credited against landfill emissions, and the effectiveness of the landfill gas recovery system where waste would otherwise have been buried. The default landfill gas recovery system effectiveness assumed by much of the industry yields GHG offsets that are very close to the direct non-biogenic GHG emissions from a WTE facility, meaning that small changes in the recovery effectiveness cause relatively larger changes in the emissions factor of the WTE facility. Finally, the economics of WTE are dependent on the MSW stream composition, with paper and wood being advantageous, metal and glass being disadvantageous, and plastics, food, and yard waste being either advantageous or disadvantageous depending upon the avoided tipping fee and the GHG emissions price.","","Available from http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.wasman.2012.02.006","","","","United States","2012-07-15T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: Waste Management; Journal Volume: 32; Journal Issue: 7; Other Information: DOI: 10.1016/j.wasman.2012.02.006; PII: S0956-053X(12)00048-7; Copyright (c) 2012 Elsevier Science B.V., Amsterdam, The Netherlands, All rights reserved.; Country of input: International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA)","","Medium: X; Size: page(s) 1366-1377","","","","Journal ID: ISSN 0956-053X; WAMAE2; TRN: US12R4059091646","10.1016/j.wasman.2012.02.006","","2012-12-11T00:00:00Z","21612992","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/21612992","","Waste Management","7","32"

In this connection landfill aeration contributes towards an accelerated, controlled and sustainable conversion of conventional anaerobic landfills into a biological stabilized state associated with a minimised emission potential. The technology has been successfully applied to landfills in Europe, North America and Asia, following different strategies depending on the geographical region, the specific legislation and the available financial resources. Furthermore, methodologies for the incorporation of landfill aeration into the carbon trade mechanisms have been developed in recent years. This manuscript gives an overview on existing concepts for landfill aeration; their application ranges and specifications. For all of the described concepts examples from different countries worldwide are provided, including details regarding their potentials and limitations. Some of the most important findings from these aeration projects are summarised and future research needs have been identified. It becomes apparent that there is a great demand for a systematisation of the available results and implications in order to further develop and optimise this very promising technology. The IWWG (International Waste Working Group) Task Group 'Landfill Aeration' contributes towards the achievement of this goal.","","Available from http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.wasman.2012.02.020","","","","United States","2012-07-15T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: Waste Management; Journal Volume: 32; Journal Issue: 7; Other Information: DOI: 10.1016/j.wasman.2012.02.020; PII: S0956-053X(12)00080-3; Copyright (c) 2012 Elsevier Science B.V., Amsterdam, The Netherlands, All rights reserved.; Country of input: International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA)","","Medium: X; Size: page(s) 1411-1419","","","","Journal ID: ISSN 0956-053X; WAMAE2; TRN: US12R4061091648","10.1016/j.wasman.2012.02.020","","2012-12-11T00:00:00Z","21612994","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/21612994","","Waste Management","7","32"

The calculations were based on the weights of the hazardous medical wastes that were regularly transferred to the sole medical waste incinerator in Athens over a 22-month period during years 2009 and 2010. The 132 health-care facilities were grouped into public and private ones, and, also, into seven sub-categories, namely: birth, cancer treatment, general, military, pediatric, psychiatric and university hospitals. Results showed that there is a large variability in the HMWUGR, even among hospitals of the same category. Average total HMWUGR varied from 0.012 kg bed{sup -1} d{sup -1}, for the public psychiatric hospitals, to up to 0.72 kg bed{sup -1} d{sup -1}, for the public university hospitals. Within the private hospitals, average HMWUGR ranged from 0.0012 kg bed{sup -1} d{sup -1}, for the psychiatric clinics, to up to 0.49 kg bed{sup -1} d{sup -1}, for the birth clinics. Based on non-parametric statistics, HMWUGR were statistically similar for the birth and general hospitals, in both the public and private sector. The private birth and general hospitals generated statistically more wastes compared to the corresponding public hospitals. The infectious/toxic and toxic medical wastes appear to be 10% and 50% of the total hazardous medical wastes generated by the public cancer treatment and university hospitals, respectively.","","Available from http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.wasman.2012.02.015","","","","United States","2012-07-15T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: Waste Management; Journal Volume: 32; Journal Issue: 7; Other Information: DOI: 10.1016/j.wasman.2012.02.015; PII: S0956-053X(12)00075-X; Copyright (c) 2012 Elsevier Science B.V., Amsterdam, The Netherlands, All rights reserved.; Country of input: International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA)","","Medium: X; Size: page(s) 1434-1441","","","","Journal ID: ISSN 0956-053X; WAMAE2; TRN: US12R4062091649","10.1016/j.wasman.2012.02.015","","2012-12-11T00:00:00Z","21612995","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/21612995","","Waste Management","7","32"

This information is important to design and cost management systems for pharmaceutical and chemical waste, for safety and health considerations and for assessing environmental impact. A total of 233 kg pharmaceutical and 110 kg chemical waste was collected, manually separated and weighed over a period of five working weeks. The total production of pharmaceutical waste comprised 3.9% w/w of the total hazardous medical waste produced by the hospital. Total pharmaceutical waste was classified in three categories, vial waste comprising 51.1%, syringe waste with 11.4% and intravenous therapy (IV) waste with 37.5% w/w of the total. Vial pharmaceutical waste only was further classified in six major categories: antibiotics, digestive system drugs, analgesics, hormones, circulatory system drugs and 'other'. Production data below are presented as average (standard deviation in parenthesis). The unit production rates for total pharmaceutical waste for the hospital were 12.4 (3.90) g/patient/d and 24.6 (7.48) g/bed/d. The respective unit production rates were: (1) for vial waste 6.4 (1.6) g/patient/d and 13 (2.6) g/bed/d, (2) for syringe waste 1.4 (0.4) g/patient/d and 2.8 (0.8) g/bed/d and (3) for IV waste 4.6 (3.0) g/patient/d and 9.2 (5.9) g/bed/d. Total chemical waste was classified in four categories, chemical reagents comprising 18.2%, solvents with 52.3%, dyes and tracers with 18.2% and solid waste with 11.4% w/w of the total. The total production of chemical waste comprised 1.8% w/w of the total hazardous medical waste produced by the hospital. Thus, the sum of pharmaceutical and chemical waste was 5.7% w/w of the total hazardous medical waste produced by the hospital. The unit production rates for total chemical waste for the hospital were 5.8 (2.2) g/patient/d and 1.1 (0.4) g/exam/d.

Black-Right-Pointing-Pointer The dry shrinkage of mortar with uncalcined FGD gypsum is lower than that of mortar without uncalcined FGD gypsum. Black-Right-Pointing-Pointer The leaching of sulfate ion of mortar is studied. - Abstract: A series of novel mortars were developed from composite binder of uncalcined FGD gypsum, fly ash (FA) and ground granulated blast furnace slag (GGBFS) for the good utilization of flue gas desulphurization (FGD) gypsum. At a fixed ratio (20%) of GGBFS to the composite binder, keeping consistency of the mortar between 9.5 and 10.0 cm, the properties of the composite mortar were studied. The results show that higher water/binder (W/B) is required to keep the consistency when increasing the percentage of FGD gypsum. No obvious influences of the W/B and content of FGD gypsum on the bleeding of paste were observed which keeps lower than 2% under all experimental conditions tried. The highest compressive and flexural strengths (ratio is 20% FGD gypsum, 20% GGBFS and 60% FA) are 22.6 and 4.3 MPa at 28 days, respectively. Scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and X-ray diffraction (XRD) results indicate that massive ettringite crystals and C-S-H gels exist in the hydration products. At 90 days the mortars with FGD gypsum is dramatically smaller drying shrinkage (563-938 micro strain) than that without FGD gypsum (about 2250 micro strain). The release of the SO{sub 4}{sup 2-} from the mortar was analyzed, indicating that the dissolution of sulfate increases with FGD gypsum. The concentration of SO{sub 4}{sup 2-} releasing from the mortar with 10% FGD gypsum is almost equal to that obtained from the mortar without FGD gypsum. The release of SO{sub 4}{sup 2-} from the mortar with 20% FGD gypsum is 9200 mg{center_dot}m{sup -2}, which is lower than that from the mortar with 95% cement clinker and 5% FGD gypsum.","","Available from http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.wasman.2012.02.014","","","","United States","2012-07-15T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: Waste Management; Journal Volume: 32; Journal Issue: 7; Other Information: DOI: 10.1016/j.wasman.2012.02.014; PII: S0956-053X(12)00074-8; Copyright (c) 2012 Elsevier Science B.V., Amsterdam, The Netherlands, All rights reserved.; Country of input: International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA)","","Medium: X; Size: page(s) 1468-1472","","","","Journal ID: ISSN 0956-053X; WAMAE2; TRN: US12R4064091651","10.1016/j.wasman.2012.02.014","","2012-12-11T00:00:00Z","21612997","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/21612997","","Waste Management","7","32"

Black-Right-Pointing-Pointer Development of an index to assess quantitatively waste treatment technologies. Black-Right-Pointing-Pointer Delphi Method was carried out so as to define environmental indicators. Black-Right-Pointing-Pointer Environmental performance evaluation of waste-to-energy plants. - Abstract: Although the concern with sustainable development and environment protection has considerably grown in the last years it is noted that the majority of decision making models and tools are still either excessively tied to economic aspects or geared to the production process. Moreover, existing models focus on the priority steps of solid waste management, beyond waste energy recovery and disposal. So, in order to help the lack of models and tools aiming at the waste treatment and final disposal, a new concept is proposed: the Cleaner Treatment, which is based on the Cleaner Production principles. This paper focuses on the development and validation of the Cleaner Treatment Index (CTI), to assess environmental performance of waste treatment technologies based on the Cleaner Treatment concept. The index is formed by aggregation (summation or product) of several indicators that consists in operational parameters. The weights of the indicator were established by Delphi Method and Brazilian Environmental Laws. In addition, sensitivity analyses were carried out comparing both aggregation methods. Finally, index validation was carried out by applying the CTI to 10 waste-to-energy plants data. From sensitivity analysis and validation results it is possible to infer that summation model is the most suitable aggregation method.

Black-Right-Pointing-Pointer Discusses the challenges of waste prevention planning. - Abstract: When planning for a new urban settlement, industrial ecology tools like scenario building and life cycle assessment can be used to assess the environmental quality of different infrastructure solutions. In Trondheim, a new greenfield settlement with carbon-neutral ambitions is being planned and five different scenarios for the waste management system of the new settlement have been compared. The results show small differences among the scenarios, however, some benefits from increased source separation of paper and metal could be found. The settlement should connect to the existing waste management system of the city, and not resort to decentralised waste treatment or recovery methods. However, as this is an urban development project with ambitious goals for lifestyle changes, effort should be put into research and initiatives for proactive waste prevention and reuse issues.","","Available from http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.wasman.2012.03.018","","","","United States","2012-07-15T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: Waste Management; Journal Volume: 32; Journal Issue: 7; Other Information: DOI: 10.1016/j.wasman.2012.03.018; PII: S0956-053X(12)00129-8; Copyright (c) 2012 Elsevier Science B.V., Amsterdam, The Netherlands, All rights reserved.; Country of input: International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA)","","Medium: X; Size: page(s) 1482-1490","","","","Journal ID: ISSN 0956-053X; WAMAE2; TRN: US12R4066091653","10.1016/j.wasman.2012.03.018","","2012-12-11T00:00:00Z","21612999","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/21612999","","Waste Management","7","32"

The present study aims at understanding and predicting the contaminant transfer properties through a significant section of this formation, with a particular emphasis on diffusion. This requires to study the nature of porosity and to perform diffusion experiments in representative samples using uranium and tritiated water (HTO), respectively taken as a reactive tracer and an inert one. The diffusive parameters, i.e. the accessible porosity and the effective diffusion coefficient were determined. Additional information was obtained with mercury porosimetry, gravimetric water content, textural and mineralogical characterization. The diffusion tests performed with HTO appear to be the best method to measure the total accessible porosity in any type of porous media, especially those having large pore size distributions. Our study demonstrates that classical gravimetric water content measurements are not sensitive to the reduction in pore size as opposed to HTO diffusion tests because capillary water is not extracted by conventional gravimetric method but can still be probed by diffusion experiments. We found effective diffusion coefficients D{sub e}(U(VI)) near 4 x 10{sup -10} m{sup 2}s{sup -1}). The slower migration of U(VI) compared to HTO indicates sorption, with R{sub d}(U(VI)) from 100 to 360 mL g{sup -1}. These values are one order of magnitude larger than other determinations of the U(VI) sorption coefficient because only the matrix porosity is concerned here. The migration of U(VI) in chalk is only limited by sorption on ancillary Fe-Pb-bearing minerals. Transport of HTO and U(VI) is independent of the porosity distribution. Uranium diffusion in the chalk matrix porosity is fast enough to allow the total invasion of the pore space within characteristic time scales of the order of 1000 years. This results in a partitioning of uranium velocities in fracture flow and matrix flow proportionally to the respective fracture and matrix porosities.

The crystal structure of human aromatase (PDB 3eqm) was used to rationalize the mechanism of action of the aromatase inhibitor 32 (IC{sub 50} 0.59 {mu}M) through docking, molecular mechanics energy minimization, and computer graphics molecular modeling, and the information was utilized to design several very potent inhibitors, including compounds 82 (IC{sub 50} 70 nM) and 84 (IC{sub 50} 36 nM). The aromatase inhibitory activities of these compounds are much more potent than that for the lead compound resveratrol, which has an IC{sub 50} of 80 {mu}M. In addition to aromatase inhibitory activity, compounds 32 and 44 also displayed potent QR2 inhibitory activity (IC{sub 50} 1.7 {mu}M and 0.27 {mu}M, respectively) and the high-resolution X-ray structures of QR2 in complex with these two compounds provide insight into their mechanism of QR2 inhibition.

"COMPARISON OF EXPERIMENTS TO CFD MODELS FOR MIXING USING DUAL OPPOSING JETS IN TANKS WITH AND WITHOUT INTERNAL OBSTRUCTIONS","Leishear, R; Poirier, M; Lee, S; Fowley, M","42 ENGINEERING; 12 MANAGEMENT OF RADIOACTIVE AND NON-RADIOACTIVE WASTES FROM NUCLEAR FACILITIES","This paper documents testing methods, statistical data analysis, and a comparison of experimental results to CFD models for blending of fluids, which were blended using a single pump designed with dual opposing nozzles in an eight foot diameter tank. Overall, this research presents new findings in the field of mixing research. Specifically, blending processes were clearly shown to have random, chaotic effects, where possible causal factors such as turbulence, pump fluctuations, and eddies required future evaluation. CFD models were shown to provide reasonable estimates for the average blending times, but large variations -- or scatter -- occurred for blending times during similar tests. Using this experimental blending time data, the chaotic nature of blending was demonstrated and the variability of blending times with respect to average blending times were shown to increase with system complexity. Prior to this research, the variation in blending times caused discrepancies between CFD models and experiments. This research addressed this discrepancy, and determined statistical correction factors that can be applied to CFD models, and thereby quantified techniques to permit the application of CFD models to complex systems, such as blending. These blending time correction factors for CFD models are comparable to safety factors used in structural design, and compensate variability that cannot be theoretically calculated. To determine these correction factors, research was performed to investigate blending, using a pump with dual opposing jets which re-circulate fluids in the tank to promote blending when fluids are added to the tank. In all, eighty-five tests were performed both in a tank without internal obstructions and a tank with vertical obstructions similar to a tube bank in a heat exchanger. These obstructions provided scale models of vertical cooling coils below the liquid surface for a full scale, liquid radioactive waste storage tank. Also, different jet diameters and different horizontal orientations of the jets were investigated with respect to blending. Two types of blending tests were performed. The first set of eighty-one tests blended small quantities of tracer fluids into solution. Data from these tests were statistically evaluated to determine blending times for the addition of tracer solution to tanks, and blending times were successfully compared to Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) models. The second set of four tests blended bulk quantities of solutions of different density and viscosity. For example, in one test a quarter tank of water was added to a three quarters of a tank of a more viscous salt solution. In this case, the blending process was noted to significantly change due to stratification of fluids, and blending times increased substantially. However, CFD models for stratification and the variability of blending times for different density fluids was not pursued, and further research is recommended in the area of blending bulk quantities of fluids. All in all, testing showed that CFD models can be effectively applied if statistically validated through experimental testing, but in the absence of experimental validation CFD model scan be extremely misleading as a basis for design and operation decisions.","","available","Savannah River Site (SRS), Aiken, SC (United States)","USDOE","","United States","2012-06-26T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: Journal of Fluids Engineering; Journal Volume: 134; Journal Issue: 11","","Medium: ED; Size: 111102","","FE-11-1369","DE-AC09-08SR22470","Journal ID: ISSN 0098-2202","10.1115/1.4007536","","2016-06-20T00:00:00Z","1072701","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/1072701","https://www.osti.gov/servlets/purl/1072701","Journal of Fluids Engineering","11","134"

It is not possible to eliminate production of waste at a nuclear power plant, but, as is shown in this report, it is in principle possible to arrange a fuel composition with no net production of transuranic elements. The idea is to find the transuranic elements composition to which the depleted uranium is continuously supplied during frequent reprocessing, and amount of each other transuranic fuel component remains unchanged in time. For each transuranic component, the balance is achieved by equating burnup and production rates. The production is due to neutron capture by the neighboring lighter isotope and subsequent beta-decay. The burnup includes fission, neutron capture and decays. For the calculations a simplified burnup model which accounts for 9 isotopes of uranium, neptunium, plutonium and americium is used. The calculated fuel composition consists mainly of uranium with minority of plutonium isotopes. Such a fuel, after usage in a sub-critical fast reactor, should be reprocessed. The fission product content increases during burnup, representing a net production of waste, while the transuranic elements and {sup 238}U should be recycled into a new fuel. For such a fuel cycle, the net consumption is only for 238U, and the net waste production is just fission products.","","","","","","United States","2012-06-19T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","Conference","Journal Name: AIP Conference Proceedings; Journal Volume: 1442; Journal Issue: 1; Conference: International conference on fusion for neutrons and subcritical nuclear fission, Varenna (Italy), 12-15 Sep 2011; Other Information: (c) 2012 American Institute of Physics; Country of input: International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA)","","Medium: X; Size: page(s) 132-136","","","","Journal ID: ISSN 0094-243X; CODEN: APCPCS; TRN: US13A0806028378","10.1063/1.4706860","","2013-04-12T00:00:00Z","22068942","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/22068942","","AIP Conference Proceedings","1","1442"

Samples of APW from different countries were traced from their application to the field through their storage phase and transportation to the final destination. The test results showed that the majority of APW retained their mechanical properties after their use preserving a 'very good quality' for recycling in terms of degradation. The degree of soil contamination concerning the APW recycling and energy recovery potential fluctuates depending on the agricultural plastic category and application. The chlorine and heavy metal content of the tested APW materials was much lower than the maximum acceptable limits for their potential use in cement industries.","","Available from http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.wasman.2012.01.018","","","","United States","2012-06-15T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: Waste Management; Journal Volume: 32; Journal Issue: 6; Other Information: DOI: 10.1016/j.wasman.2012.01.018; PII: S0956-053X(12)00032-3; Copyright (c) 2012 Elsevier Science B.V., Amsterdam, The Netherlands, All rights reserved.; Country of input: International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA)","","Medium: X; Size: page(s) 1075-1090","","","","Journal ID: ISSN 0956-053X; WAMAE2; TRN: US12R4045091634","10.1016/j.wasman.2012.01.018","","2012-12-11T00:00:00Z","21612980","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/21612980","","Waste Management","6","32"

The model took into account the heat production and the transfers by evaporation, convection between material and gas crossing the material, conduction and surface convection between gas and material in bottom and upper parts of the reactor. The model was adjusted thanks to the measurements practised during fifteen composting experiments in which five organic wastes were, each, composted under three constant aeration rates. Heat production was considered proportional to oxygen consumption rate and the enthalpy per mole oxygen consumed was assumed constant. The convective heat transfer coefficients were determined on basis of the continuous measurements of the temperatures of both the lid and the bottom part of the reactor. The model allowed a satisfying prediction of the temperature of the composting material. In most cases, the mean absolute discard between the experimental and the simulated temperatures was inferior to 2.5 Degree-Sign C and the peaks of temperature occurred with less than 8 h delay. For the half of the experiments the temperature discard between the simulated peak and the experimental one was inferior to 5 Degree-Sign C. On basis of the calculation of a stoichiometric production of water through oxidation of the biodegradable organic matter, the simulation of water going out from material as vapour also allowed a rather satisfying prediction of the mass of water in final mixture.

This study investigated the distribution tendency of trace elements in municipal solid waste (MSW) or incinerator ash, including valuable non-ferrous metals (Ni, Co, Cr, Mn, Mo, Ti, V, W, Zr), precious group metals (PGMs) originated from WEEE (Ag, Au, Pd, Pt), and others (Al, B, Pb, Si), between Fe-rich and Cu-rich metal phases by means of simple thermodynamic calculations. Most of the typical alloying elements for steel (Co, Cr, Mo, Nb, Ni, Si, Ti, V, and W) and Rh were preferentially distributed into the Fe-rich phase. PGMs, such as Au, Ag, and Pd, were enriched in the Cu-rich phase, whereas Pt was almost equally distributed into both phases. Since the primary metallurgical processing of Cu is followed by an electrolysis for refining, and since PGMs in crude copper have been industrially recovered from the resulting anode slime, our results indicated that Ag, Au, and Pd could be effectively recovered from MSW if the Cu-rich phase could be selectively collected.","","Available from http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.wasman.2012.01.025","","","","United States","2012-06-15T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: Waste Management; Journal Volume: 32; Journal Issue: 6; Other Information: DOI: 10.1016/j.wasman.2012.01.025; PII: S0956-053X(12)00039-6; Copyright (c) 2012 Elsevier Science B.V., Amsterdam, The Netherlands, All rights reserved.; Country of input: International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA)","","Medium: X; Size: page(s) 1148-1155","","","","Journal ID: ISSN 0956-053X; WAMAE2; TRN: US12R4049091637","10.1016/j.wasman.2012.01.025","","2012-12-11T00:00:00Z","21612983","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/21612983","","Waste Management","6","32"

During the mesophilic and thermophilic runs, the reactor operated at an organic loading rate of 2.2 kgVS/m{sup 3}d and a hydraulic retention time of 20 days. In the temperature phased run, the first reactor operated at an organic loading rate of 15 kgVS/m{sup 3}d and a hydraulic retention time of 2 days while the second reactor operated at an organic loading rate of 2.2 kgVS/m{sup 3}d and a hydraulic retention time of 18 days (20 days for the whole temperature phased system). The performance of the reactor improved with increases in temperature. The COD removal increased from 35% in mesophilic conditions, to 45% in thermophilic conditions, and 55% in the two stage temperature phased system. As a consequence, the specific biogas production increased from 0.33 to 0.45 and to 0.49 m{sup 3}/kgVS{sub fed} at 35, 55, and 65 + 55 Degree-Sign C, respectively. The extreme thermophilic reactor working at 65 Degree-Sign C showed a high hydrolytic capability and a specific yield of 0.33 gCOD (soluble) per gVS{sub fed}. The effluent of the extreme thermophilic reactor showed an average concentration of soluble COD and volatile fatty acids of 20 and 9 g/l, respectively. Acetic and propionic acids were the main compounds found in the acids mixture. Because of the improved digestion efficiency, organic nitrogen and phosphorus were solubilised in the bulk. Their concentration, however, did not increase as expected because of the formation of salts of hydroxyapatite and struvite inside the reactor.","","Available from http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.wasman.2012.01.006","","","","United States","2012-06-15T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: Waste Management; Journal Volume: 32; Journal Issue: 6; Other Information: DOI: 10.1016/j.wasman.2012.01.006; PII: S0956-053X(12)00020-7; Copyright (c) 2012 Elsevier Science B.V., Amsterdam, The Netherlands, All rights reserved.; Country of input: International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA)","","Medium: X; Size: page(s) 1196-1201","","","","Journal ID: ISSN 0956-053X; WAMAE2; TRN: US12R4050091638","10.1016/j.wasman.2012.01.006","","2012-12-11T00:00:00Z","21612984","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/21612984","","Waste Management","6","32"

The most common polymers are polystyrene, acrylonitrile-butadiene-styrene, polycarbonate blends, high-impact polystyrene and polypropylene. Additives to darken color are common contaminants in these plastics when used in CRT televisions and small WEEE. These additives can make plastic identification difficult, along with missing polymer identification and flame retardant identification marks. These drawbacks contribute to the inefficiency of manual dismantling of WEEE, which is the typical recycling process in Portugal.

This study therefore attempts to develop a model for quantitatively evaluating the social performance of CWM by using a system dynamics (SD) approach. Firstly, major variables affecting the social performance of CWM are identified and a holistic system for assessing the social performance of CWM is formulated in line with feedback relationships underlying these variables. The developed system is then converted into a SD model through the software iThink. An empirical case study is finally conducted to demonstrate application of the model. Results of model validation indicate that the model is robust and reasonable to reflect the situation of the real system under study. Findings of the case study offer helpful insights into effectively promoting the social performance of CWM of the project investigated. Furthermore, the model exhibits great potential to function as an experimental platform for dynamically evaluating effects of management measures on improving the social performance of CWM of construction projects.","","Available from http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.wasman.2012.01.028","","","","United States","2012-06-15T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: Waste Management; Journal Volume: 32; Journal Issue: 6; Other Information: DOI: 10.1016/j.wasman.2012.01.028; PII: S0956-053X(12)00042-6; Copyright (c) 2012 Elsevier Science B.V., Amsterdam, The Netherlands, All rights reserved.; Country of input: International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA)","","Medium: X; Size: page(s) 1218-1228","","","","Journal ID: ISSN 0956-053X; WAMAE2; TRN: US12R4052091640","10.1016/j.wasman.2012.01.028","","2012-12-11T00:00:00Z","21612986","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/21612986","","Waste Management","6","32"

Black-Right-Pointing-Pointer It's the first application to waste management under multiple complexities. Black-Right-Pointing-Pointer It tackles nonlinear economies-of-scale effects in interval-parameter constraints. Black-Right-Pointing-Pointer It estimates costs more accurately than the linear-regression-based model. Black-Right-Pointing-Pointer Uncertainties are decreased and more satisfactory interval solutions are obtained. - Abstract: To tackle nonlinear economies-of-scale (EOS) effects in interval-parameter constraints for a representative waste management problem, an inexact piecewise-linearization-based fuzzy flexible programming (IPFP) model is developed. In IPFP, interval parameters for waste amounts and transportation/operation costs can be quantified; aspiration levels for net system costs, as well as tolerance intervals for both capacities of waste treatment facilities and waste generation rates can be reflected; and the nonlinear EOS effects transformed from objective function to constraints can be approximated. An interactive algorithm is proposed for solving the IPFP model, which in nature is an interval-parameter mixed-integer quadratically constrained programming model. To demonstrate the IPFP's advantages, two alternative models are developed to compare their performances. One is a conventional linear-regression-based inexact fuzzy programming model (IPFP2) and the other is an IPFP model with all right-hand-sides of fussy constraints being the corresponding interval numbers (IPFP3). The comparison results between IPFP and IPFP2 indicate that the optimized waste amounts would have the similar patterns in both models. However, when dealing with EOS effects in constraints, the IPFP2 may underestimate the net system costs while the IPFP can estimate the costs more accurately. The comparison results between IPFP and IPFP3 indicate that their solutions would be significantly different. The decreased system uncertainties in IPFP's solutions demonstrate its effectiveness for providing more satisfactory interval solutions than IPFP3. Following its first application to waste management, the IPFP can be potentially applied to other environmental problems under multiple complexities.","","Available from http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.wasman.2012.01.019","","","","United States","2012-06-15T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: Waste Management; Journal Volume: 32; Journal Issue: 6; Other Information: DOI: 10.1016/j.wasman.2012.01.019; PII: S0956-053X(12)00033-5; Copyright (c) 2012 Elsevier Science B.V., Amsterdam, The Netherlands, All rights reserved.; Country of input: International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA)","","Medium: X; Size: page(s) 1244-1257","","","","Journal ID: ISSN 0956-053X; WAMAE2; TRN: US12R4053091641","10.1016/j.wasman.2012.01.019","","2012-12-11T00:00:00Z","21612987","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/21612987","","Waste Management","6","32"

The system was designed for meat and bone meal (MBM) to be injected into the gasifier at a mass flow-rate range of 1-5 g/s. The designed system consists of two stages of screw conveyors, including a metering stage which controlled the flow-rate of fuel, a rotary airlock and an injection conveyor stage, which delivered that fuel at a consistent rate to the FBG. The rotary airlock which was placed between these conveyors, proved unable to maintain a pressure seal, thus the entire conveying system was sealed and pressurized. A pneumatic injection nozzle was also fabricated, tested and fitted to the end of the injection conveyor for direct injection and dispersal into the fluidized bed. The 150 mm metering screw conveyor was shown to effectively control the mass output rate of the system, across a fuel output range of 1-25 g/s, while the addition of the 50 mm injection screw conveyor reduced the irregularity (error) of the system output rate from 47% to 15%. Although material plugging was found to be an issue in the inlet hopper to the injection conveyor, the addition of air sparging ports and a system to pulse air into those ports was found to successfully eliminate this issue. The addition of the pneumatic injection nozzle reduced the output irregularity further to 13%, with an air supply of 50 slpm as the minimum air supply to drive this injector. After commissioning of this final system to the FBG reactor, the injection nozzle was found to plug with char however, and was subsequently removed from the system. Final operation of the reactor continues satisfactorily with the two screw conveyors operating at matching pressure with the fluidized bed, with the output rate of the system estimated based on system characteristic equations, and confirmed by static weight measurements made before and after testing. The error rate by this method is reported to be approximately 10%, which is slightly better than the estimated error rate of 15% for the conveyor system. The reliability of this measurement prediction method relies upon the relative consistency of the physical properties of MBM with respect to its bulk density and feeding characteristics.","","Available from http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.wasman.2012.01.010","","","","United States","2012-06-15T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: Waste Management; Journal Volume: 32; Journal Issue: 6; Other Information: Copyright (c) 2012 Elsevier Science B.V., Amsterdam, The Netherlands, All rights reserved.; Country of input: International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA)","","Medium: X; Size: page(s) 1138-1147","","","","Journal ID: ISSN 0956-053X; CODEN: WAMAE2; PII: S0956-053X(12)00024-4; TRN: US12R4048106565","10.1016/J.WASMAN.2012.01.010","","2013-03-21T00:00:00Z","22020537","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/22020537","","Waste Management","6","32"

Corresponding to the results of the process recovery in the full-scale digester, laboratory experiments showed that CaO was more capable of stabilizing the process than NaOH. While both additives were able to raise the pH to a neutral milieu (pH &gt; 7.0), the formation of aggregates was observed particularly when CaO was used as the additive. Scanning electron microscopy investigations revealed calcium phosphate compounds in the core of the aggregates. Phosphate seemed to be released by phosphorus-accumulating organisms, when volatile fatty acids accumulated. The calcium, which was charged by the CaO addition, formed insoluble salts with long chain fatty acids, and caused the precipitation of calcium phosphate compounds. These aggregates were surrounded by a white layer of carbon rich organic matter, probably consisting of volatile fatty acids. Thus, during the process recovery with CaO, the decrease in the amount of accumulated acids in the liquid phase was likely enabled by (1) the formation of insoluble calcium salts with long chain fatty acids, (2) the adsorption of volatile fatty acids by the precipitates, (3) the acid uptake by phosphorus-accumulating organisms and (4) the degradation of volatile fatty acids in the aggregates. Furthermore, this mechanism enabled a stable process performance after re-activation of biogas production. In contrast, during the counter measure with NaOH aggregate formation was only minor resulting in a rapid process failure subsequent the increase of the organic loading rate.","","Available from http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.wasman.2012.01.015","","","","United States","2012-06-15T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: Waste Management; Journal Volume: 32; Journal Issue: 6; Other Information: DOI: 10.1016/j.wasman.2012.01.015; PII: S0956-053X(12)00029-3; Copyright (c) 2012 Elsevier Science B.V., Amsterdam, The Netherlands, All rights reserved.; Country of input: International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA)","","Medium: X; Size: page(s) 1122-1130","","","","Journal ID: ISSN 0956-053X; WAMAE2; TRN: US12R4047091636","10.1016/j.wasman.2012.01.015","","2012-12-11T00:00:00Z","21612982","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/21612982","","Waste Management","6","32"

Several research activities showed some recycled spent fuel can be used as additional fuel loading for increasing fuel breeding capability as well as improving intrinsic aspect of nuclear non-proliferation. The present investigation intends to evaluate the composition of heavy metals inventories and fuel breeding capability in the FBR design based on the loaded fuel of light water reactor (LWR) spent fuel (SF) of 33 GWd/t with 5 years cooling time by adopting depletion code of ORIGEN. Whole core analysis of FBR design is performed by adopting and coupling codes such as SLAROM code, JOINT and CITATION codes. Nuclear data library, JFS-3-J-3.2R which is based on the JENDL 3.2 has been used for nuclear data analysis. JSFR design is the basis design reference which basically adopted 800 days cycle length for 4 batches system. Higher inventories of plutonium of MOX fuel and TRU fuel types at equilibrium composition than initial composition have been shown. Minor actinide (MA) inventory compositions obtain a different inventory trends at equilibrium composition for both fuel types. Higher Inventory of MA is obtained by MOX fuel and less MA inventory for TRU fuel at equilibrium composition than initial composition. Some different MA inventories can be estimated from the different inventory trend of americium (Am). Higher americium inventory for MOX fuel and less americium inventory for TRU fuel at equilibrium condition. Breeding ratio of TRU fuel is relatively higher compared with MOX fuel type. It can be estimated from relatively higher production of Pu-238 (through converted MA) in TRU fuel, and Pu-238 converts through neutron capture to produce Pu-239. Higher breeding ratio of MOX fuel and TRU fuel types at equilibrium condition are estimated from converted fertile material during reactor operation into fissile material of plutonium such as converted uranium fuel (converted U-238 into Pu-239) or additional converted fuel from MA into Pu-238 and changes into Pu-239 by capturing neutron. Loading LWR SF gives better fuel breeding capability and increase inventory of MA for doping material of MOX fuel; however, it requires more supply MA inventory for TRU fuel type.","","","","","","United States","2012-06-06T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","Conference","Journal Name: AIP Conference Proceedings; Journal Volume: 1448; Journal Issue: 1; Conference: ICANSE 2011: 3. international conference on advances in nuclear science and engineering, Bali (Indonesia), 14-17 Nov 2011; Other Information: (c) 2012 American Institute of Physics; Country of input: International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA)","","Medium: X; Size: page(s) 119-125","","","","Journal ID: ISSN 0094-243X; CODEN: APCPCS; TRN: US12A8561094265","10.1063/1.4725446","","2013-03-14T00:00:00Z","22004160","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/22004160","","AIP Conference Proceedings","1","1448"

In addition, analysis on nuclear forensics which is related to spent fuel compositions becomes one of the interesting topics to evaluate the origin and the composition of spent fuels from the spent fuel foot-prints. Spent fuel compositions of different fuel types give some typical spent fuel foot prints and can be estimated the origin of source of those spent fuel compositions. Some technics or methods have been developing based on some science and technological capability including experimental and modeling or theoretical aspects of analyses. Some foot-print of nuclear forensics will identify the typical information of spent fuel compositions such as enrichment information, burnup or irradiation time, reactor types as well as the cooling time which is related to the age of spent fuels. This paper intends to evaluate the typical spent fuel compositions of light water (LWR) and fast breeder reactors (FBR) from the view point of some foot prints of nuclear forensics. An established depletion code of ORIGEN is adopted to analyze LWR spent fuel (SF) for several burnup constants and decay times. For analyzing some spent fuel compositions of FBR, some coupling codes such as SLAROM code, JOINT and CITATION codes including JFS-3-J-3.2R as nuclear data library have been adopted. Enriched U-235 fuel composition of oxide type is used for fresh fuel of LWR and a mixed oxide fuel (MOX) for FBR fresh fuel. Those MOX fuels of FBR come from the spent fuels of LWR. Some typical spent fuels from both LWR and FBR will be compared to distinguish some typical foot-prints of SF based on nuclear forensic analysis.","","","","","","United States","2012-06-06T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","Conference","Journal Name: AIP Conference Proceedings; Journal Volume: 1448; Journal Issue: 1; Conference: ICANSE 2011: 3. international conference on advances in nuclear science and engineering, Bali (Indonesia), 14-17 Nov 2011; Other Information: (c) 2012 American Institute of Physics; Country of input: International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA)","","Medium: X; Size: page(s) 142-152","","","","Journal ID: ISSN 0094-243X; CODEN: APCPCS; TRN: US12A8564094268","10.1063/1.4725449","","2013-03-14T00:00:00Z","22004163","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/22004163","","AIP Conference Proceedings","1","1448"

Measurements of 90Sr were conducted with a whole body counter for residents of the Techa Riverside communities (Southern Urals, Russia), who ingested large amounts of 90Sr as a result of releases of liquid radioactive wastes into the river from the Mayak plutonium facility in early 1950s. The results of this study showed an increase in the rate of cortical bone resorption in both men and women, as based on the use of accidentally ingested 90Sr as a tracer for bone metabolism. In men there was a continuous gradual increase in the rate of cortical bone resorption after 55 years from 2.8 to 4.5%/year by the age of 75 years. In women, there was a doubled increase in the rate of cortical bone resorption after menopause of up to 6%/year; then the rate remained unchanged for 10-12 years with a subsequent gradual decline down to 5-5.5%/year. Comparison of the rate of cortical bone resorption in men and women older than 55 years showed that women expressed significantly higher levels of cortical bone resorption.","","","Pacific Northwest National Lab.

Black-Right-Pointing-Pointer Direct emissions and resource use were based on full-scale data. Black-Right-Pointing-Pointer Conservation of nutrients/energy content over the system was considered. Black-Right-Pointing-Pointer Systems with high energy/nutrient recovery are most environmentally beneficial. - Abstract: Four systems for household food waste collection are compared in relation the environmental impact categories eutrophication potential, acidification potential, global warming potential as well as energy use. Also, a hotspot analysis is performed in order to suggest improvements in each of the compared collection systems. Separate collection of household food waste in paper bags (with and without drying prior to collection) with use of kitchen grinders and with use of vacuum system in kitchen sinks were compared. In all cases, food waste was used for anaerobic digestion with energy and nutrient recovery in all cases. Compared systems all resulted in net avoidance of assessed environmental impact categories; eutrophication potential (-0.1 to -2.4 kg NO{sub 3}{sup -}eq/ton food waste), acidification potential (-0.4 to -1.0 kg SO{sub 2}{sup -}eq/ton food waste), global warming potential (-790 to -960 kg CO{sub 2}{sup -}eq/ton food waste) and primary energy use (-1.7 to -3.6 GJ/ton food waste). Collection with vacuum system results in the largest net avoidance of primary energy use, while disposal of food waste in paper bags for decentralized drying before collection result in a larger net avoidance of global warming, eutrophication and acidification. However, both these systems not have been taken into use in large scale systems yet and further investigations are needed in order to confirm the outcomes from the comparison. Ranking of scenarios differ largely if considering only emissions in the foreground system, indicating the importance of taking also downstream emissions into consideration when comparing different collection systems. The hot spot identification shows that losses of organic matter in mechanical pretreatment as well as tank connected food waste disposal systems and energy in drying and vacuum systems reply to the largest impact on the results in each system respectively.","","Available from http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.wasman.2012.01.008","","","","United States","2012-05-15T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: Waste Management; Journal Volume: 32; Journal Issue: 5; Other Information: DOI: 10.1016/j.wasman.2012.01.008; PII: S0956-053X(12)00022-0; Copyright (c) 2012 Elsevier Science B.V., Amsterdam, The Netherlands, All rights reserved.; Country of input: International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA)","","Medium: X; Size: page(s) 806-815","","","","Journal ID: ISSN 0956-053X; WAMAE2; TRN: US12R4027091616","10.1016/j.wasman.2012.01.008","","2012-12-11T00:00:00Z","21612962","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/21612962","","Waste Management","5","32"

These rejected streams consist of many different materials (e.g., polyethylene (PE), polypropylene (PP), polystyrene (PS), polyvinyl chloride (PVC), polyethylene terephthalate (PET), acrylonitrile butadiene styrene (ABS), aluminum, tetra-brik, and film) for which an attempt at complete separation is not technically possible or economically viable, and they are typically sent to landfills or incinerators. For this study, a simulated plastic mixture and a real waste sample from a sorting plant were pyrolyzed using a non-stirred semi-batch reactor. Red mud, a byproduct of the aluminum industry, was used as a catalyst. Despite the fact that the samples had a similar volume of material, there were noteworthy differences in the pyrolysis yields. The real waste sample resulted, after pyrolysis, in higher gas and solid yields and consequently produced less liquid. There were also significant differences noted in the compositions of the compared pyrolysis products.","","Available from http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.wasman.2011.06.016","","","","United States","2012-05-15T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: Waste Management; Journal Volume: 32; Journal Issue: 5; Other Information: DOI: 10.1016/j.wasman.2011.06.016; PII: S0956-053X(11)00281-9; Copyright (c) 2011 Elsevier Science B.V., Amsterdam, The Netherlands, All rights reserved.; Country of input: International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA)","","Medium: X; Size: page(s) 826-832","","","","Journal ID: ISSN 0956-053X; WAMAE2; TRN: US12R4028091617","10.1016/j.wasman.2011.06.016","","2012-12-11T00:00:00Z","21612963","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/21612963","","Waste Management","5","32"

The current ELV recycling rate is around 80%, while the remaining waste is called automotive shredder residue (ASR), or car fluff. In Europe, this is mainly landfilled because it is extremely heterogeneous and often polluted with car fluids. Despite technical difficulties, in the coming years it will be necessary to recover materials from car fluff in order to meet the ELV Directive requirement. This study deals with ASR pretreatment and pyrolysis, and aims to determine whether the ELV material recycling target may be achieved by car fluff mechanical separation followed by pyrolysis with a bench scale reactor. Results show that flotation followed by pyrolysis of the light, organic fraction may be a suitable ASR recycling technique if the oil can be further refined and used as a chemical. Moreover, metals are liberated during thermal cracking and can be easily separated from the pyrolysis char, amounting to roughly 5% in mass. Lastly, pyrolysis can be a good starting point from a 'waste-to-chemicals' perspective, but further research should be done with a focus on oil and gas refining, in order both to make products suitable for the chemical industry and to render the whole recycling process economically feasible.","","Available from http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.wasman.2011.10.030","","","","United States","2012-05-15T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: Waste Management; Journal Volume: 32; Journal Issue: 5; Other Information: DOI: 10.1016/j.wasman.2011.10.030; PII: S0956-053X(11)00493-4; Copyright (c) 2011 Elsevier Science B.V., Amsterdam, The Netherlands, All rights reserved.; Country of input: International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA)","","Medium: X; Size: page(s) 852-858","","","","Journal ID: ISSN 0956-053X; WAMAE2; TRN: US12R4031091620","10.1016/j.wasman.2011.10.030","","2012-12-11T00:00:00Z","21612966","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/21612966","","Waste Management","5","32"

Performed experiments were aimed at assessing the performance of acidophilic chemoautotrophic Fe/S-oxidizing bacteria for such different solid matrices, also focusing on the effect of solid concentration and of different substrata. The achieved results have evidenced that metal solubilization seems to be strongly influenced by the metal speciation and partitioning in the solid matrix. No biological effect was observed for Ni, Zn, As, Cr mobilization from marine sediments (34%, 44%, 15%, 10% yields, respectively) due to metal partitioning. On the other hand, for spent refinery catalysts (Ni, V, Mo extractions of 83%, 90% and 40%, respectively) and fluorescent powders (Zn and Y extraction of 55% and 70%, respectively), the improvement in metal extraction observed in the presence of a microbial activity confirms the key role of Fe/S oxidizing bacteria and ferrous iron. A negative effect of solid concentration was in general observed on bioleaching performances, due to the toxicity of dissolved metals and/or to the solid organic component.","","Available from http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.wasman.2011.10.014","","","","United States","2012-05-15T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: Waste Management; Journal Volume: 32; Journal Issue: 5; Other Information: DOI: 10.1016/j.wasman.2011.10.014; PII: S0956-053X(11)00473-9; Copyright (c) 2011 Elsevier Science B.V., Amsterdam, The Netherlands, All rights reserved.; Country of input: International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA)","","Medium: X; Size: page(s) 949-956","","","","Journal ID: ISSN 0956-053X; WAMAE2; TRN: US12R4038091627","10.1016/j.wasman.2011.10.014","","2012-12-11T00:00:00Z","21612973","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/21612973","","Waste Management","5","32"

Black-Right-Pointing-Pointer The fixation rate decreases with residential time and finally keeps a constant. Black-Right-Pointing-Pointer Water mass fraction of 55% is optimal for the sediment for Ni, Mn, Zn, Cu and Cr. Black-Right-Pointing-Pointer Water mass fraction of 75% is optimal for the sediment for Pb. Black-Right-Pointing-Pointer We found higher temperature versus lower non-residual fraction except that of Pb. - Abstract: Fixation of heavy metals in the slag produced during incineration of sewage sludge will reduce emission of the metals to the atmosphere and make the incineration process more environmentally friendly. The effects of incineration conditions (incineration temperature 500-1100 Degree-Sign C, furnace residence time 0-60 min, mass fraction of water in the sludge 0-75%) on the fixation rates and species partitioning of Cd, Pb, Cr, Cu, Zn, Mn and Ni in slag were investigated. When the incineration temperature was increased from 500 to 1100 Degree-Sign C, the fixation rate of Cd decreased from 87% to 49%, while the fixation rates of Cu and Mn were stable. The maximum fixation rates for Pb and Zn and for Ni and Cr were reached at 900 and 1100 Degree-Sign C, respectively. The fixation rates of Cu, Ni, Cd, Cr and Zn decreased as the residence time increased. With a 20 min residence time, the fixation rates of Pb and Mn were low. The maximum fixation rates of Ni, Mn, Zn, Cu and Cr were achieved when the mass fraction of water in the sludge was 55%. The fixation rate of Cd decreased as the water mass fraction increased, while the fixation rate of Pb increased. Partitioning analysis of the metals contained in the slag showed that increasing the incineration temperature and residence time promoted complete oxidation of the metals. This reduced the non-residual fractions of the metals, which would lower the bioavailability of the metals. The mass fraction of water in the sludge had little effect on the partitioning of the metals. Correlation analysis indicated that the fixation rates of heavy metals in the sludge and the forms of heavy metals in the incinerator slag could be controlled by optimization of the incineration conditions. These results show how the bioavailability of the metals can be reduced for environmentally friendly disposal of the incinerator slag.","","Available from http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.wasman.2011.12.003","","","","United States","2012-05-15T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: Waste Management; Journal Volume: 32; Journal Issue: 5; Other Information: DOI: 10.1016/j.wasman.2011.12.003; PII: S0956-053X(11)00545-9; Copyright (c) 2011 Elsevier Science B.V., Amsterdam, The Netherlands, All rights reserved.; Country of input: International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA)","","Medium: X; Size: page(s) 957-964","","","","Journal ID: ISSN 0956-053X; WAMAE2; TRN: US12R4039091628","10.1016/j.wasman.2011.12.003","","2012-12-11T00:00:00Z","21612974","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/21612974","","Waste Management","5","32"

This objective was met by a combination of batch water leach tests, column leach tests, and computer modeling. The laboratory tests were conducted on soil alone, fly ash alone, and URM-fly ash-lime kiln dust mixtures. The results indicated that an increase in fly ash and lime content has significant effects on leaching behavior of heavy metals from URM-fly ash mixture. An increase in fly ash content and a decrease in lime content promoted leaching of Ba, B and Cu whereas Zn leaching was primarily affected by the fly ash content. Numerically predicted field metal concentrations were significantly lower than the peak metal concentrations obtained in laboratory column leach tests, and field concentrations decreased with time and distance due to dispersion in soil vadose zone.","","Available from http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.wasman.2011.12.012","","","","United States","2012-05-15T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: Waste Management; Journal Volume: 32; Journal Issue: 5; Other Information: DOI: 10.1016/j.wasman.2011.12.012; PII: S0956-053X(11)00582-4; Copyright (c) 2011 Elsevier Science B.V., Amsterdam, The Netherlands, All rights reserved.; Country of input: International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA)","","Medium: X; Size: page(s) 965-978","","","","Journal ID: ISSN 0956-053X; WAMAE2; TRN: US12R4040091629","10.1016/j.wasman.2011.12.012","","2012-12-11T00:00:00Z","21612975","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/21612975","","Waste Management","5","32"

Currently used techniques for the extraction of metals from E-waste by using either chemical or biological leaching have their own limitations. Chemical leaching is much rapid and efficient but has its own environmental consequences, even the future prospects of associated nanoremediation are also uncertain. Biological leaching on the other hand is comparatively a cost effective technique but at the same moment it is time consuming and the complete recovery of the metal, alone by biological leaching is not possible in most of the cases. The current review addresses the individual issues related to chemical and biological extraction techniques and proposes a hybrid-methodology which incorporates both, along with safer chemicals and compatible microbes for better and efficient extraction of metals from the E-waste.","","Available from http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.wasman.2011.12.002","","","","United States","2012-05-15T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: Waste Management; Journal Volume: 32; Journal Issue: 5; Other Information: DOI: 10.1016/j.wasman.2011.12.002; PII: S0956-053X(11)00542-3; Copyright (c) 2011 Elsevier Science B.V., Amsterdam, The Netherlands, All rights reserved.; Country of input: International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA)","","Medium: X; Size: page(s) 979-990","","","","Journal ID: ISSN 0956-053X; WAMAE2; TRN: US12R4041091630","10.1016/j.wasman.2011.12.002","","2012-12-11T00:00:00Z","21612976","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/21612976","","Waste Management","5","32"

Black-Right-Pointing-Pointer Integrated waste management and industrial production are crucial to green products. Black-Right-Pointing-Pointer Most of the waste glass rejects are sent back to the glass industry. Black-Right-Pointing-Pointer Recovered co-products give more environmental gains than does avoided landfill. Black-Right-Pointing-Pointer Energy intensive recycling must be limited to waste that cannot be closed-loop recycled. - Abstract: As part of the EU Life + NOVEDI project, a new eco-efficient recycling route has been implemented to maximise resources and energy recovery from post-consumer waste glass, through integrated waste management and industrial production. Life cycle assessment (LCA) has been used to identify engineering solutions to sustainability during the development of green building products. The new process and the related LCA are framed within a meaningful case of industrial symbiosis, where multiple waste streams are utilised in a multi-output industrial process. The input is a mix of rejected waste glass from conventional container glass recycling and waste special glass such as monitor glass, bulbs and glass fibres. The green building product is a recycled foam glass (RFG) to be used in high efficiency thermally insulating and lightweight concrete. The environmental gains have been contrasted against induced impacts and improvements have been proposed. Recovered co-products, such as glass fragments/powders, plastics and metals, correspond to environmental gains that are higher than those related to landfill avoidance, whereas the latter is cancelled due to increased transportation distances. In accordance to an eco-efficiency principle, it has been highlighted that recourse to highly energy intensive recycling should be limited to waste that cannot be closed-loop recycled.","","Available from http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.wasman.2011.10.018","","","","United States","2012-05-15T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: Waste Management; Journal Volume: 32; Journal Issue: 5; Other Information: DOI: 10.1016/j.wasman.2011.10.018; PII: S0956-053X(11)00477-6; Copyright (c) 2011 Elsevier Science B.V., Amsterdam, The Netherlands, All rights reserved.; Country of input: International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA)","","Medium: X; Size: page(s) 1000-1008","","","","Journal ID: ISSN 0956-053X; WAMAE2; TRN: US12R4042091631","10.1016/j.wasman.2011.10.018","","2012-12-11T00:00:00Z","21612977","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/21612977","","Waste Management","5","32"

For the material fractions with a significant energy content this might not be the case if the treatment alternative is a waste-to-energy plant with high energy recovery rates. The environmental impacts from recycling and from incineration of six material fractions in household waste have been compared through life cycle assessment assuming high-performance technologies for material recycling as well as for waste incineration. The results showed that there are environmental benefits when recycling paper, glass, steel and aluminium instead of incinerating it. For cardboard and plastic the results were more unclear, depending on the level of energy recovery at the incineration plant, the system boundaries chosen and which impact category was in focus. Further, the environmental impact potentials from collection, pre-treatment and transport was compared to the environmental benefit from recycling and this showed that with the right means of transport, recyclables can in most cases be transported long distances. However, the results also showed that recycling of some of the material fractions can only contribute marginally in improving the overall waste management system taking into consideration their limited content in average Danish household waste.","","Available from http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.wasman.2011.12.025","","","","United States","2012-05-15T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: Waste Management; Journal Volume: 32; Journal Issue: 5; Other Information: DOI: 10.1016/j.wasman.2011.12.025; PII: S0956-053X(11)00595-2; Copyright (c) 2012 Elsevier Science B.V., Amsterdam, The Netherlands, All rights reserved.; Country of input: International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA)","","Medium: X; Size: page(s) 1009-1018","","","","Journal ID: ISSN 0956-053X; WAMAE2; TRN: US12R4043091632","10.1016/j.wasman.2011.12.025","","2012-12-11T00:00:00Z","21612978","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/21612978","","Waste Management","5","32"

Black-Right-Pointing-Pointer Using a incineration to manage part of the waste is better environmentally. Black-Right-Pointing-Pointer Incineration leads to more power plant emission offsets. Black-Right-Pointing-Pointer Landfilling all of the waste would be preferred financially. - Abstract: This study evaluates the environmental performance and discounted costs of the incineration and landfilling of municipal solid waste that is ready for the final disposal while accounting for existing waste diversion initiatives, using the life cycle assessment (LCA) methodology. Parameters such as changing waste generation quantities, diversion rates and waste composition were also considered. Two scenarios were assessed in this study on how to treat the waste that remains after diversion. The first scenario is the status quo, where the entire residual waste was landfilled whereas in the second scenario approximately 50% of the residual waste was incinerated while the remainder is landfilled. Electricity was produced in each scenario. Data from the City of Toronto was used to undertake this study. Results showed that the waste diversion initiatives were more effective in reducing the organic portion of the waste, in turn, reducing the net electricity production of the landfill while increasing the net electricity production of the incinerator. Therefore, the scenario that incorporated incineration performed better environmentally and contributed overall to a significant reduction in greenhouse gas emissions because of the displacement of power plant emissions; however, at a noticeably higher cost. Although landfilling proves to be the better financial option, it is for the shorter term. The landfill option would require the need of a replacement landfill much sooner. The financial and environmental effects of this expenditure have yet to be considered.","","Available from http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.wasman.2011.10.023","","","","United States","2012-05-15T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: Waste Management; Journal Volume: 32; Journal Issue: 5; Other Information: DOI: 10.1016/j.wasman.2011.10.023; PII: S0956-053X(11)00482-X; Copyright (c) 2011 Elsevier Science B.V., Amsterdam, The Netherlands, All rights reserved.; Country of input: International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA)","","Medium: X; Size: page(s) 1019-1030","","","","Journal ID: ISSN 0956-053X; WAMAE2; TRN: US12R4044091633","10.1016/j.wasman.2011.10.023","","2012-12-11T00:00:00Z","21612979","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/21612979","","Waste Management","5","32"

Black-Right-Pointing-Pointer We did a kinetic model for the de-chlorination of PVC molecule. Black-Right-Pointing-Pointer A temperature of 340 Degree-Sign C was defined as the optimum temperature for breaking the bond of chlorine in the PVC molecule. Black-Right-Pointing-Pointer The experimental validation of this temperature, led to a removal rate of 99.9% chlorine. - Abstract: Although PVC-containing wastes are an important potential source of energy they are frequently disposed in landfill. In thermal treatment processes such as pyrolysis and gasification, the presence of poly(vinyl chloride) (PVC), a compound with 56.7% of chlorine, may cause problems concerned with environmental protection, as consequence of the formation of hydrochloric acid, chlorine gas and dioxins, as well as corrosion phenomena of the reactor/equipment materials. Thus, a possible solution may involve a previous removal of the chlorine from PVC containing waste through a pyrolysis process at low temperatures before the material being submitted to a subsequent thermal treatment, for energetic valorization. In this work, a kinetic model for the thermal decomposition of PVC has been developed, in view of its de-chlorination. DTA/TGA testing at different temperatures indicated a first order reaction and an activation energy of 133,800 J/mol. An almost completed de-chlorination reaction was obtained at 340 Degree-Sign C under an inert atmosphere. The resulted material is a C{sub n}H{sub n} type polymer with potential to be used in an energy recovery process. Validation test performed at laboratory scale indicate that the temperature of 340 Degree-Sign C enables the removal of {approx}99.9% of the chlorine present in PVC. The chloride can be fixed in the form of an aqueous solution of HCl or calcium chloride, driving to an alternative full process with environmental benefits and reduction of the costs associated to the PCV - containing materials/wastes management.","","Available from http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.wasman.2012.01.004","","","","United States","2012-05-15T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: Waste Management; Journal Volume: 32; Journal Issue: 5; Other Information: DOI: 10.1016/j.wasman.2012.01.004; PII: S0956-053X(12)00018-9; Copyright (c) 2012 Elsevier Science B.V., Amsterdam, The Netherlands, All rights reserved.; Country of input: International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA)","","Medium: X; Size: page(s) 847-851","","","","Journal ID: ISSN 0956-053X; WAMAE2; TRN: US12R4030091619","10.1016/j.wasman.2012.01.004","","2012-12-11T00:00:00Z","21612965","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/21612965","","Waste Management","5","32"

Black-Right-Pointing-Pointer There is a relationship between C and D waste generated and railway functional units. Black-Right-Pointing-Pointer The methodology proposed can be used to obtain new constants for other areas. - Abstract: In the last years, the European Union (EU) has been focused on the reduction of construction and demolition (C and D) waste. Specifically, in 2006, Spain generated roughly 47 million tons of C and D waste, of which only 13.6% was recycled. This situation has lead to the drawing up of many regulations on C and D waste during the past years forcing EU countries to include new measures for waste prevention and recycling. Among these measures, the mandatory obligation to quantify the C and D waste expected to be originated during a construction project is mandated. However, limited data is available on civil engineering projects. Therefore, the aim of this research study is to improve C and D waste management in railway projects, by developing a model for C and D waste quantification. For this purpose, we develop two equations which estimate in advance the amount, both in weight and volume, of the C and D waste likely to be generated in railway construction projects, including the category of C and D waste generated for the entire project.","","Available from http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.wasman.2012.01.007","","","","United States","2012-05-15T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: Waste Management; Journal Volume: 32; Journal Issue: 5; Other Information: DOI: 10.1016/j.wasman.2012.01.007; PII: S0956-053X(12)00021-9; Copyright (c) 2012 Elsevier Science B.V., Amsterdam, The Netherlands, All rights reserved.; Country of input: International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA)","","Medium: X; Size: page(s) 920-924","","","","Journal ID: ISSN 0956-053X; WAMAE2; TRN: US12R4034091623","10.1016/j.wasman.2012.01.007","","2012-12-11T00:00:00Z","21612969","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/21612969","","Waste Management","5","32"

To address this, Salmonella enterica (serovars Senftenberg and Poona), Enterococcus faecalis, Campylobacter jejuni, Campylobacter coli and a lux-marked strain of Escherichia coli O157 were inoculated into laboratory-scale bioreduction vessels containing sheep carcass constituents. Numbers of all pathogens and the metabolic activity of E. coli O157 decreased significantly within the liquor waste over time, and only E. faecalis remained detectable after 3 months. Only very low numbers of Salmonella spp. and E. faecalis were detected in bioaerosols, and only at initial stages of the trial.

Black-Right-Pointing-Pointer Disposal of animal mortalities is often overlooked in evaluating the environmental impacts of animal production. Black-Right-Pointing-Pointer we quantify annual emissions from cattle carcass disposal in the United States as 1.6 Tg CO{sub 2} equivalents. - Abstract: Approximately 2.2 million cattle carcasses require disposal annually in the United States. Land burial is a convenient disposal method that has been widely used in animal production for disposal of both daily mortalities as well as during catastrophic mortality events. To date, greenhouse gas production after mortality burial has not been quantified, and this study represents the first attempt to quantify greenhouse gas emissions from land burial of animal carcasses. In this study, anaerobic decomposition of both homogenized and unhomogenized cattle carcass material was investigated using bench-scale reactors. Maximum yields of methane and carbon dioxide were 0.33 and 0.09 m{sup 3}/kg dry material, respectively, a higher methane yield than that previously reported for municipal solid waste. Variability in methane production rates were observed over time and between reactors. Based on our laboratory data, annual methane emissions from burial of cattle mortalities in the United States could total 1.6 Tg CO{sub 2} equivalents. Although this represents less than 1% of total emissions produced by the agricultural sector in 2009, greenhouse gas emissions from animal carcass burial may be significant if disposal of swine and poultry carcasses is also considered.","","Available from http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.wasman.2011.11.015","","","","United States","2012-05-15T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: Waste Management; Journal Volume: 32; Journal Issue: 5; Other Information: DOI: 10.1016/j.wasman.2011.11.015; PII: S0956-053X(11)00540-X; Copyright (c) 2011 Elsevier Science B.V., Amsterdam, The Netherlands, All rights reserved.; Country of input: International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA)","","Medium: X; Size: page(s) 939-943","","","","Journal ID: ISSN 0956-053X; WAMAE2; TRN: US12R4036091625","10.1016/j.wasman.2011.11.015","","2012-12-11T00:00:00Z","21612971","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/21612971","","Waste Management","5","32"

Black-Right-Pointing-Pointer Experimental conditions for microwave-assisted sample digestion followed by AAS measurements are described. Black-Right-Pointing-Pointer By washing the glass it is possible to reduce the concentration below legal limits. - Abstract: In this study, spent compact fluorescent lamps were characterized to determine the distribution of mercury. The procedure used in this research allowed mercury to be extracted in the vapor phase, from the phosphor powder, and the glass matrix. Mercury concentration in the three phases was determined by the method known as cold vapor atomic absorption spectrometry. Median values obtained in the study showed that a compact fluorescent lamp contained 24.52 {+-} 0.4 ppb of mercury in the vapor phase, 204.16 {+-} 8.9 ppb of mercury in the phosphor powder, and 18.74 {+-} 0.5 ppb of mercury in the glass matrix. There are differences in mercury concentration between the lamps since the year of manufacture or the hours of operation affect both mercury content and its distribution. The 85.76% of the mercury introduced into a compact fluorescent lamp becomes a component of the phosphor powder, while more than 13.66% is diffused through the glass matrix. By washing and eliminating all phosphor powder attached to the glass surface it is possible to classified the glass as a non-hazardous waste.","","Available from http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.wasman.2011.12.001","","","","United States","2012-05-15T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: Waste Management; Journal Volume: 32; Journal Issue: 5; Other Information: DOI: 10.1016/j.wasman.2011.12.001; PII: S0956-053X(11)00538-1; Copyright (c) 2011 Elsevier Science B.V., Amsterdam, The Netherlands, All rights reserved.; Country of input: International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA)","","Medium: X; Size: page(s) 944-948","","","","Journal ID: ISSN 0956-053X; WAMAE2; TRN: US12R4037091626","10.1016/j.wasman.2011.12.001","","2012-12-11T00:00:00Z","21612972","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/21612972","","Waste Management","5","32"

We are developing a process which first leaches phosphate from the high-level waste solids with aqueous sodium hydroxide, and then isolates the phosphate by precipitation with calcium oxide. Tests with actual tank waste confirmed that this process is an effective method of phosphate removal from the sludge and offers an additional option for managing the phosphorus in the Hanford tank waste solids. The presence of vibrationally active species, such as nitrate and phosphate ions, in the tank waste processing streams makes the phosphate removal process an ideal candidate for monitoring by Raman or infrared spectroscopic means. As a proof-of-principle demonstration, Raman and Fourier transform infrared (FTIR) spectra were acquired for all phases during a test of the process with actual tank waste. Quantitative determination of phosphate, nitrate, and sulfate in the liquid phases was achieved by Raman spectroscopy, demonstrating the applicability of Raman spectroscopy for the monitoring of these species in the tank waste process streams.","","","Pacific Northwest National Lab.

In this paper, electrochemical techniques are used to determine the mechanism of interaction between the iron and smectite clay minerals. Iron electrodes coated with an evaporated smectite suspension (clay-modified iron electrodes, CMIEs) were prepared using five different smectites: SAz-1, SWa-1, STx-1, SWy-1, and SHCa-1. All the smectites were exchanged with Na+ and one sample of SWy-1 was also exchanged with Mg2+. Potentiodynamic potential scans and cyclic voltammograms were taken using the CMIEs and uncoated but passivated iron electrodes. These electrochemical experiments, along with measurements of the amount of Fe2+ and Fe3+ sorbed in the smectite coating, suggested that the smectite removed the passive layer of the underlying iron electrode during the evaporation process. Cyclic voltammograms taken after the CMIEs were biased at the active-passive transition potential for varying amounts of time suggested that the smectite limited growth of a passive layer, preventing passivation. These results are attributed to the Broensted acidity of the smectite as well as to its ability to sorb iron cations. Oxides that did form on the surface of the iron in the presence of the smectite when it was biased anodically seemed to be different than those that form on the surface of an uncoated iron electrode under otherwise similar conditions; this difference suggested that the smectite reacted with the Fe2+ formed from the oxidation of the underlying iron. No significant correlation could be found between the ability of the smectite to remove the iron passive film and the smectite type. The results have implications for the mixing of sediments and iron particles in permeable reactive barriers, underground storage of radioactive waste in steel canisters, and the use of smectite supports in preventing aggregation of nano-sized zero-valent iron.","","","Pacific Northwest National Lab.

R and D work at the beamline focuses on various aspects of nuclear waste disposal within INE's mission to provide the scientific basis for assessing long-term safety of a final nuclear waste repository. The INE-Beamline is accessible for the actinide and radiochemistry community through the ANKA proposal system and the European Union Integrated Infrastructure Initiative ACTINET-I3. Experiments with activities up to 1 x 10{sup +6} times the European exemption limit are feasible within a safe but flexible containment concept. Measurements with monochromatic radiation are performed at photon energies varying between {approx}2.1 keV (P K-edge) and {approx}25 keV (Pd K-edge), including the lanthanide L-edges and the actinide M- and L3-edges up to Cf. The close proximity of the INE-Beamline to INE controlled area labs offers infrastructure unique in Europe for the spectroscopic and microscopic characterization of actinide samples. The modular beamline design enables sufficient flexibility to adapt sample environments and detection systems to many scientific questions. The well-established bulk techniques x-ray absorption fine structure (XAFS) spectroscopy in transmission and fluorescence mode have been augmented by advanced methods using a microfocused beam, including (confocal) XAFS/x-ray fluorescence detection and a combination of (micro-)XAFS and (micro-)x-ray diffraction.

Black-Right-Pointing-Pointer The final landfill amount is reduced and materials are recovered by DMS process. - Abstract: This study evaluates the effects of co-gasification of municipal solid waste with and without the municipal solid waste bottom ash using two large-scale commercial operation plants. From the viewpoint of operation data, there is no significant difference between municipal solid waste treatment with and without the bottom ash. The carbon conversion ratios are as high as 91.7% and 95.3%, respectively and this leads to significantly low PCDD/DFs yields via complete syngas combustion. The gross power generation efficiencies are 18.9% with the bottom ash and 23.0% without municipal solid waste bottom ash, respectively. The effects of the equivalence ratio are also evaluated. With the equivalence ratio increasing, carbon monoxide concentration is decreased, and carbon dioxide and the syngas temperature (top gas temperature) are increased. The carbon conversion ratio is also increased. These tendencies are seen in both modes. Co-gasification using the gasification and melting system (Direct Melting System) has a possibility to recover materials effectively. More than 90% of chlorine is distributed in fly ash. Low-boiling-point heavy metals, such as lead and zinc, are distributed in fly ash at rates of 95.2% and 92.0%, respectively. Most of high-boiling-point heavy metals, such as iron and copper, are distributed in metal. It is also clarified that slag is stable and contains few harmful heavy metals such as lead. Compared with the conventional waste management framework, 85% of the final landfill amount reduction is achieved by co-gasification of municipal solid waste with bottom ash and incombustible residues. These results indicate that the combined production of slag with co-gasification of municipal solid waste with the bottom ash constitutes an ideal approach to environmental conservation and resource recycling.","","Available from http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.wasman.2011.10.019","","","","United States","2012-04-15T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: Waste Management; Journal Volume: 32; Journal Issue: 4; Other Information: DOI: 10.1016/j.wasman.2011.10.019; PII: S0956-053X(11)00478-8; Copyright (c) 2011 Elsevier Science B.V., Amsterdam, The Netherlands, All rights reserved.; Country of input: International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA)","","Medium: X; Size: page(s) 667-675","","","","Journal ID: ISSN 0956-053X; WAMAE2; TRN: US12R4020091609","10.1016/j.wasman.2011.10.019","","2012-12-11T00:00:00Z","21612955","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/21612955","","Waste Management","4","32"

The acidic dissociation constants of HFe(CN){sub 6}{sup 3-}, H{sub 2}Fe(CN){sub 6}{sup 2-} and H{sub 3}Fe(CN){sub 6}{sup -} were found to be pK(1)(II) = 3.9 ± 0.1, pK(2)(II) = 2.0 ± 0.1, and pK(3)(II) = 0.0 ± 0.1, respectively. These constants were determined by taking into account that the activities of the species are independent of the ionic strength.

Nonetheless, significant ambiguities in the knowledge base are apparent. Consequently this study investigates sulphur mechanisms within a novel two stage fluid bed-plasma gasification process. This paper includes a detailed review of gasification and plasma fundamentals in relation to the specific process, along with insight on MSW based feedstock properties and sulphur pollutant therein. As a first step to understanding sulphur partitioning and speciation within the process, thermodynamic modelling of the fluid bed stage has been performed. Preliminary findings, supported by plant experience, indicate the prominence of solid phase sulphur species (as opposed to H{sub 2}S) - Na and K based species in particular. Work is underway to further investigate and validate this.","","Available from http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.wasman.2011.08.020","","","","United States","2012-04-15T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: Waste Management; Journal Volume: 32; Journal Issue: 4; Other Information: DOI: 10.1016/j.wasman.2011.08.020; PII: S0956-053X(11)00384-9; Copyright (c) 2011 Elsevier Science B.V., Amsterdam, The Netherlands, All rights reserved.; Country of input: International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA)","","Medium: X; Size: page(s) 676-684","","","","Journal ID: ISSN 0956-053X; WAMAE2; TRN: US12R4021091610","10.1016/j.wasman.2011.08.020","","2012-12-11T00:00:00Z","21612956","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/21612956","","Waste Management","4","32"

The monitor links microwave-assisted sample preparation with an automated anion exchange column separation and detection using a flow-through solid scintillator detector. The sample preparation steps acidify the sample, decompose organics, and convert all Tc species to the pertechnetate anion. The column-based anion exchange procedure separates the pertechnetate from the complex sample matrix, so that radiometric detection can provide accurate measurement of 99Tc. We developed a preprogrammed spike addition procedure to automatically determine matrix-matched calibration. The overall measurement efficiency that is determined simultaneously provides a self-diagnostic parameter for the radiochemical separation and overall instrument function. Continuous, automated operation was demonstrated over the course of 54 h, which resulted in the analysis of 215 samples plus 54 hly spike-addition samples, with consistent overall measurement efficiency for the operation of the monitor. A sample can be processed and measured automatically in just 12.5 min with a detection limit of 23.5 Bq/mL of 99Tc in low activity waste (0.495 mL sample volume), with better than 10% RSD precision at concentrations above the quantification limit. This rapid automated analysis method was developed to support nuclear waste processing operations planned for the Hanford nuclear site.","","","Pacific Northwest National Lab.

This work examines changes in pore structure due to these reactions in a previously-conducted column experiment. The column was sectioned and 2D images of the pore space were generated using backscattered electron microscopy and energy dispersive X-ray spectroscopy. A pre-precipitation scenario was created by digitally removing mineral matter identified as secondary precipitates. Porosity, determined by segmenting the images to distinguish pore space from mineral matter, was up to 0.11 less after reaction. Erosion-dilation analysis was used to compute pore and throat size distributions. Images with precipitation had more small and fewer large pores. Precipitation decreased throat sizes and the abundance of large throats. These findings agree with previous findings based on 3D X-ray CMT imaging, observing decreased porosity, clogging of small throats, and little change in large throats. However, 2D imaging found an increase in small pores, mainly in intragranular regions or below the resolution of the 3D images. Also, an increase in large pores observed via 3D imaging was not observed in the 2D analysis. Changes in flow conducting throats that are the key permeability-controlling features were observed in both methods.","","","Pacific Northwest National Lab.

Currently, borosilicate glass is the waste form selected for immobilization of this waste stream, however, the low thermal stability and solubility of MoO{sub 3} in borosilicate glass translates into a maximum waste loading in the range of 15-20 mass%. Glass-ceramics provide the opportunity to target durable crystalline phases, e.g., powellite, oxyapatite, celsian, and pollucite, that will incorporate MoO{sub 3} as well as other waste components such as lanthanides, alkalis, and alkaline earths at levels 2X the solubility limits of a single-phase glass. In addition a glass-ceramic could provide higher thermal stability, depending upon the properties of the crystalline and amorphous phases. Glass-ceramics were successfully synthesized at waste loadings of 42, 45, and 50 mass% with the following glass additives: B{sub 2}O{sub 3}, Al{sub 2}O{sub 3}, CaO and SiO{sub 2} by slow cooling form from a glass melt. Glass-ceramics were characterized in terms of phase assemblage, morphology, and thermal stability. The targeted phases: powellite and oxyapatite were observed in all of the compositions along with a lanthanide borosilicate, and cerianite. Results of this initial investigation of glass-ceramics show promise as a potential waste form to replace single-phase borosilicate glass.","","","Pacific Northwest National Lab.

Printing paper, dog food (DF), wooden chopsticks, and mixed plastic film and sheets of polyethylene, polypropylene, and polystyrene were prepared as model MSW components, in which polyvinylchloride (PVC) powder and sodium chloride were used to simulate Cl sources. While more than 75% of carbon in paper, DF, and wood was recovered as char under both LT and HT conditions, plastics did not degrade under either LT or HT conditions. The heating value (HV) of obtained char was 13,886-27,544 kJ/kg and was comparable to that of brown coal and lignite. Higher formation of fixed carbon and greater oxygen dissociation during HTSW were thought to improve the HV of char. Cl atoms added as PVC powder and sodium chloride to raw material remained in char after HTSW. However, most Cl originating from PVC was found to converse into soluble Cl compounds during HTSW under the HT condition and could be removed by washing. From these results, the merit of HTSW as a method of recovering solid fuel from MSW is considered to produce char with minimal carbon loss without a drying process prior to HTSW. In addition, Cl originating from PVC decomposes into soluble Cl compound under the HT condition. The combination of HTSW under the HT condition and char washing might improve the quality of char as alternative fuel.","","Available from http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.wasman.2011.10.006","","","","United States","2012-03-15T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: Waste Management; Journal Volume: 32; Journal Issue: 3; Other Information: Copyright (c) 2011 Elsevier Science B.V., Amsterdam, The Netherlands, All rights reserved.; Country of input: International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA)","","Medium: X; Size: page(s) 410-416","","","","Journal ID: ISSN 0956-053X; CODEN: WAMAE2; PII: S0956-053X(11)00465-X; TRN: US12R4008095057","10.1016/J.WASMAN.2011.10.006","","2013-03-14T00:00:00Z","22004952","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/22004952","","Waste Management","3","32"

Black-Right-Pointing-Pointer GWR model can be used to create clusters of cities for solid waste management. - Abstract: In studies focusing on the factors that impact solid waste generation habits and rates, the potential spatial dependency in solid waste generation data is not considered in relating the waste generation rates to its determinants. In this study, spatial dependency is taken into account in determination of the significant socio-economic and climatic factors that may be of importance for the municipal solid waste (MSW) generation rates in different provinces of Turkey. Simultaneous spatial autoregression (SAR) and geographically weighted regression (GWR) models are used for the spatial data analyses. Similar to ordinary least squares regression (OLSR), regression coefficients are global in SAR model. In other words, the effect of a given independent variable on a dependent variable is valid for the whole country. Unlike OLSR or SAR, GWR reveals the local impact of a given factor (or independent variable) on the waste generation rates of different provinces. Results show that provinces within closer neighborhoods have similar MSW generation rates. On the other hand, this spatial autocorrelation is not very high for the exploratory variables considered in the study. OLSR and SAR models have similar regression coefficients. GWR is useful to indicate the local determinants of MSW generation rates. GWR model can be utilized to plan waste management activities at local scale including waste minimization, collection, treatment, and disposal. At global scale, the MSW generation rates in Turkey are significantly related to unemployment rate and asphalt-paved roads ratio. Yet, significances of these variables may diminish at local scale for some provinces. At local scale, different factors may be important in affecting MSW generation rates.","","Available from http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.wasman.2011.10.017","","","","United States","2012-03-15T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: Waste Management; Journal Volume: 32; Journal Issue: 3; Other Information: DOI: 10.1016/j.wasman.2011.10.017; PII: S0956-053X(11)00476-4; Copyright (c) 2011 Elsevier Science B.V., Amsterdam, The Netherlands, All rights reserved.; Country of input: International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA)","","Medium: X; Size: page(s) 359-371","","","","Journal ID: ISSN 0956-053X; WAMAE2; TRN: US12R4005091595","10.1016/j.wasman.2011.10.017","","2012-12-11T00:00:00Z","21612941","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/21612941","","Waste Management","3","32"

Two types of wastes were used: synthetic OFMSW (average particle size of 1 mm; 0.71 g Volatile Solids/g waste), and OFMSW coming from a composting full scale plant (average particle size of 30 mm; 0.16 g Volatile Solids/g waste). A modification of a widely-validated product-generation kinetic model has been proposed.

Black-Right-Pointing-Pointer So far landfill mining has mainly been used to solve waste management issues. Black-Right-Pointing-Pointer A new perspective on landfills as resource reservoirs is emerging. Black-Right-Pointing-Pointer The potential of resource extraction from landfills is significant. Black-Right-Pointing-Pointer We outline several key challenges for realization of resource extraction from landfills. - Abstract: Landfills have historically been seen as the ultimate solution for storing waste at minimum cost. It is now a well-known fact that such deposits have related implications such as long-term methane emissions, local pollution concerns, settling issues and limitations on urban development. Landfill mining has been suggested as a strategy to address such problems, and in principle means the excavation, processing, treatment and/or recycling of deposited materials. This study involves a literature review on landfill mining covering a meta-analysis of the main trends, objectives, topics and findings in 39 research papers published during the period 1988-2008. The results show that, so far, landfill mining has primarily been seen as a way to solve traditional management issues related to landfills such as lack of landfill space and local pollution concerns. Although most initiatives have involved some recovery of deposited resources, mainly cover soil and in some cases waste fuel, recycling efforts have often been largely secondary. Typically, simple soil excavation and screening equipment have therefore been applied, often demonstrating moderate performance in obtaining marketable recyclables. Several worldwide changes and recent research findings indicate the emergence of a new perspective on landfills as reservoirs for resource extraction. Although the potential of this approach appears significant, it is argued that facilitating implementation involves a number of research challenges in terms of technology innovation, clarifying the conditions for realization and developing standardized frameworks for evaluating economic and environmental performance from a systems perspective. In order to address these challenges, a combination of applied and theoretical research is required.","","Available from http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.wasman.2011.10.015","","","","United States","2012-03-15T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: Waste Management; Journal Volume: 32; Journal Issue: 3; Other Information: DOI: 10.1016/j.wasman.2011.10.015; PII: S0956-053X(11)00474-0; Copyright (c) 2011 Elsevier Science B.V., Amsterdam, The Netherlands, All rights reserved.; Country of input: International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA)","","Medium: X; Size: page(s) 513-520","","","","Journal ID: ISSN 0956-053X; WAMAE2; TRN: US12R4011091600","10.1016/j.wasman.2011.10.015","","2012-12-11T00:00:00Z","21612946","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/21612946","","Waste Management","3","32"
"A dynamic model for assessing the effects of management strategies on the reduction of construction and demolition waste","Yuan Hongping, E-mail: hpyuan2005@gmail.com; Chini, Abdol R; Lu Yujie, E-mail: lyj0415@gmail.com; Department of Civil and Environmental Engineering, University of Maryland, MD (United States)]; Liyin, Shen","12 MANAGEMENT OF RADIOACTIVE WASTES, AND NON-RADIOACTIVE WASTES FROM NUCLEAR FACILITIES; COMPUTER CODES; COMPUTERIZED SIMULATION; CONSTRUCTION; DEMOLITION; WASTE MANAGEMENT; MANAGEMENT; SIMULATION","Highlights: Black-Right-Pointing-Pointer We proposes a model for projecting C and D waste reduction of construction projects.

Black-Right-Pointing-Pointer By using the model, best strategies could be identified before being implemented. - Abstract: During the past few decades, construction and demolition (C and D) waste has received increasing attention from construction practitioners and researchers worldwide. A plethora of research regarding C and D waste management has been published in various academic journals. However, it has been determined that existing studies with respect to C and D waste reduction are mainly carried out from a static perspective, without considering the dynamic and interdependent nature of the whole waste reduction system. This might lead to misunderstanding about the actual effect of implementing any waste reduction strategies. Therefore, this research proposes a model that can serve as a decision support tool for projecting C and D waste reduction in line with the waste management situation of a given construction project, and more importantly, as a platform for simulating effects of various management strategies on C and D waste reduction. The research is conducted using system dynamics methodology, which is a systematic approach that deals with the complexity - interrelationships and dynamics - of any social, economic and managerial system. The dynamic model integrates major variables that affect C and D waste reduction. In this paper, seven causal loop diagrams that can deepen understanding about the feedback relationships underlying C and D waste reduction system are firstly presented. Then a stock-flow diagram is formulated by using software for system dynamics modeling. Finally, a case study is used to illustrate the validation and application of the proposed model. Results of the case study not only built confidence in the model so that it can be used for quantitative analysis, but also assessed and compared the effect of three designed policy scenarios on C and D waste reduction. One major contribution of this study is the development of a dynamic model for evaluating C and D waste reduction strategies under various scenarios, so that best management strategies could be identified before being implemented in practice.","","Available from http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.wasman.2011.11.006","","","","United States","2012-03-15T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: Waste Management; Journal Volume: 32; Journal Issue: 3; Other Information: DOI: 10.1016/j.wasman.2011.11.006; PII: S0956-053X(11)00525-3; Copyright (c) 2011 Elsevier Science B.V., Amsterdam, The Netherlands, All rights reserved.; Country of input: International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA)","","Medium: X; Size: page(s) 521-531","","","","Journal ID: ISSN 0956-053X; WAMAE2; TRN: US12R4012091601","10.1016/j.wasman.2011.11.006","","2012-12-11T00:00:00Z","21612947","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/21612947","","Waste Management","3","32"

Black-Right-Pointing-Pointer 'Top-down' approach to the Life Cycle Analysis methodology. Black-Right-Pointing-Pointer Results based on real buildings measurements and demolition contractor activities.

Unlike most LCAs, the approach is 'top-down' rather than 'bottom-up', which usually involves large amounts of data and the use of specific software applications. This approach is considered appropriate for a limited but expedient LCA designed to compare the environmental impacts of different life cycle options. Present results, based on real buildings measurements and demolition contractor activities, show that shallow, superficial, selective demolition may not result in reduced environmental impacts. Calculations actually show an increase (generally less than 5%) in most impact categories for the Materials and End of Life stages because of extra transportation needs. However, core material separation in demolition operations and its recycling and/or reuse does bring environmental benefits. A reduction of around 77% has been estimated in the climate change impact category, 57% in acidification potential and 81% in the summer smog impact (for the life cycle stages referred).","","Available from http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.wasman.2011.11.011","","","","United States","2012-03-15T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: Waste Management; Journal Volume: 32; Journal Issue: 3; Other Information: DOI: 10.1016/j.wasman.2011.11.011; PII: S0956-053X(11)00535-6; Copyright (c) 2011 Elsevier Science B.V., Amsterdam, The Netherlands, All rights reserved.; Country of input: International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA)","","Medium: X; Size: page(s) 532-541","","","","Journal ID: ISSN 0956-053X; WAMAE2; TRN: US12R4013091602","10.1016/j.wasman.2011.11.011","","2012-12-11T00:00:00Z","21612948","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/21612948","","Waste Management","3","32"

A process was developed to treat E-waste in an environmentally benign process. The process consisted of thermal plasma treatment followed by recovery of metal values through mineral acid leaching. In the thermal process, the E-waste was melted to recover the metal values as a metallic mixture. The metallic mixture was subjected to acid leaching in presence of depolarizer. The leached liquor mainly contained copper as the other elements like Al and Fe were mostly in alloy form as per the XRD and phase diagram studies. Response surface model was used to optimize the conditions for leaching. More than 90% leaching efficiency at room temperature was observed for Cu, Ni and Co with HCl as the solvent, whereas Fe and Al showed less than 40% efficiency.","","Available from http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.wasman.2011.11.001","","","","United States","2012-03-15T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: Waste Management; Journal Volume: 32; Journal Issue: 3; Other Information: DOI: 10.1016/j.wasman.2011.11.001; PII: S0956-053X(11)00495-8; Copyright (c) 2011 Elsevier Science B.V., Amsterdam, The Netherlands, All rights reserved.; Country of input: International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA)","","Medium: X; Size: page(s) 575-583","","","","Journal ID: ISSN 0956-053X; WAMAE2; TRN: US12R4015091604","10.1016/j.wasman.2011.11.001","","2012-12-11T00:00:00Z","21612950","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/21612950","","Waste Management","3","32"

This study constructs a physical input-output life-cycle assessment (PIO-LCA) model. The PIO-LCA model is used to investigate environmental impacts of four categories of waste recycling in China's paper industry: crop straws, bagasse, textile wastes and scrap paper. Crop straw recycling and wood utilization for paper production have small total intensity of environmental impacts. Moreover, environmental impacts reduction of crop straw recycling and wood utilization benefits the most from technology development. Thus, using crop straws and wood (including wood wastes) for paper production should be promoted. Technology development has small effects on environmental impacts reduction of bagasse recycling, textile waste recycling and scrap paper recycling. In addition, bagasse recycling and textile waste recycling have big total intensity of environmental impacts. Thus, the development of bagasse recycling and textile waste recycling should be properly limited. Other pathways for reusing bagasse and textile wastes should be explored and evaluated. Moreover, imports of scrap paper should be encouraged to reduce large indirect impacts of scrap paper recycling on domestic environment.","","Available from http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.wasman.2011.10.020","","","","United States","2012-03-15T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: Waste Management; Journal Volume: 32; Journal Issue: 3; Other Information: DOI: 10.1016/j.wasman.2011.10.020; PII: S0956-053X(11)00479-X; Copyright (c) 2011 Elsevier Science B.V., Amsterdam, The Netherlands, All rights reserved.; Country of input: International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA)","","Medium: X; Size: page(s) 603-612","","","","Journal ID: ISSN 0956-053X; WAMAE2; TRN: US12R4017091606","10.1016/j.wasman.2011.10.020","","2012-12-11T00:00:00Z","21612952","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/21612952","","Waste Management","3","32"

A.","12 MANAGEMENT OF RADIOACTIVE WASTES, AND NON-RADIOACTIVE WASTES FROM NUCLEAR FACILITIES; ABSORPTION SPECTROSCOPY; BOROSILICATE GLASS; NUCLEAR MAGNETIC RESONANCE; RADIOACTIVE WASTE STORAGE","The structure of iron-bearing sodium borosilicate glasses with up to 10 mol% FeO has been investigated in the range 0.15 ≤ Fe{sup 3+}/SFe ≤ 0.95. According to Moessbauer spectroscopy, Fe{sup 3+} and Fe{sup 2+} are mainly in tetrahedral and octahedral coordination, respectively, although other coordination states exist for both cations. From XANES experiments, we conclude that increasing Fe content and varying redox states have only a minor effect on the relative proportions of BO{sub 3} and BO{sub 4} units. In Raman spectra, a decrease of the proportion of BO{sub 4} species present in danburite-like units (Na{sub 2}O.B{sub 2}O{sub 3}.2SiO{sub 2}) is found upon increasing iron content and oxidizing state. Whereas the insensitivity of the overall boron speciation to iron content and redox state points to weak interactions between boron and iron, the changes affecting BO{sub 4} species do indicate a more subtle interplay between Fe{sup 3+} and the other tetrahedrally coordinated cations (Si,B) because of the competition between tetrahedral Fe{sup 3+} and B{sup 3+} for charge compensation by Na{sup +}.

Black-Right-Pointing-Pointer Diversity of methanogens correlates with the VFA concentration and methane yield. Black-Right-Pointing-Pointer Aggregates indicate tight spatial relationship between minerals and microorganisms. - Abstract: Microbial community diversity in two thermophilic laboratory-scale and three full-scale anaerobic co-digesters was analysed by genetic profiling based on PCR-amplified partial 16S rRNA genes. In parallel operated laboratory reactors a stepwise increase of the organic loading rate (OLR) resulted in a decrease of methane production and an accumulation of volatile fatty acids (VFAs). However, almost threefold different OLRs were necessary to inhibit the gas production in the reactors. During stable reactor performance, no significant differences in the bacterial community structures were detected, except for in the archaeal communities. Sequencing of archaeal PCR products revealed a dominance of the acetoclastic methanogen Methanosarcina thermophila, while hydrogenotrophic methanogens were of minor importance and differed additionally in their abundance between reactors. As a consequence of the perturbation, changes in bacterial and archaeal populations were observed. After organic overload, hydrogenotrophic methanogens (Methanospirillum hungatei and Methanoculleus receptaculi) became more dominant, especially in the reactor attributed by a higher OLR capacity. In addition, aggregates composed of mineral and organic layers formed during organic overload and indicated tight spatial relationships between minerals and microbial processes that may support de-acidification processes in over-acidified sludge. Comparative analyses of mesophilic stationary phase full-scale reactors additionally indicated a correlation between the diversity of methanogens and the VFA concentration combined with the methane yield. This study demonstrates that the coexistence of two types of methanogens, i.e. hydrogenotrophic and acetoclastic methanogens is necessary to respond successfully to perturbation and leads to stable process performance.","","Available from http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.wasman.2011.11.013","","","","United States","2012-03-15T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: Waste Management; Journal Volume: 32; Journal Issue: 3; Other Information: DOI: 10.1016/j.wasman.2011.11.013; PII: S0956-053X(11)00537-X; Copyright (c) 2011 Elsevier Science B.V., Amsterdam, The Netherlands, All rights reserved.; Country of input: International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA)","","Medium: X; Size: page(s) 389-399","","","","Journal ID: ISSN 0956-053X; WAMAE2; TRN: US12R4007091597","10.1016/j.wasman.2011.11.013","","2012-12-11T00:00:00Z","21612943","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/21612943","","Waste Management","3","32"

Black-Right-Pointing-Pointer Variety in scope, quality and stakeholders makes cost estimation challenging in IR. Black-Right-Pointing-Pointer Integrate waste flow and cost models using cost functions to improve cost planning. - Abstract: The importance of cost planning for solid waste management (SWM) in industrialising regions (IR) is not well recognised. The approaches used to estimate costs of SWM can broadly be classified into three categories - the unit cost method, benchmarking techniques and developing cost models using sub-approaches such as cost and production function analysis. These methods have been developed into computer programmes with varying functionality and utility. IR mostly use the unit cost and benchmarking approach to estimate their SWM costs. The models for cost estimation, on the other hand, are used at times in industrialised countries, but not in IR. Taken together, these approaches could be viewed as precedents that can be modified appropriately to suit waste management systems in IR. The main challenges (or problems) one might face while attempting to do so are a lack of cost data, and a lack of quality for what data do exist. There are practical benefits to planners in IR where solid waste problems are critical and budgets are limited.","","Available from http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.wasman.2011.11.004","","","","United States","2012-03-15T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: Waste Management; Journal Volume: 32; Journal Issue: 3; Other Information: DOI: 10.1016/j.wasman.2011.11.004; PII: S0956-053X(11)00501-0; Copyright (c) 2011 Elsevier Science B.V., Amsterdam, The Netherlands, All rights reserved.; Country of input: International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA)","","Medium: X; Size: page(s) 584-594","","","","Journal ID: ISSN 0956-053X; WAMAE2; TRN: US12R4016091605","10.1016/j.wasman.2011.11.004","","2012-12-11T00:00:00Z","21612951","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/21612951","","Waste Management","3","32"

These constraints cannot prevent the accumulation of large spinel crystals in considerably cooler regions ({approx} 850 C) of the glass discharge riser during melter idling and significantly limit the waste loading, which is reflected in a high volume of waste glass, and would result in high capital, production, and disposal costs.

The magnesium oxide phase remains pure MgO, while the zirconia incorporates a small amount of magnesium oxide along with all of the plutonium oxide and erbium oxide. The performance of the material under reactor and repository environments was examined. Reactor conditions are examined using a pressure vessel to expose the material to 300 degrees C water. To assess the performance of the material as a waste form it was submerged in 90 degrees C water for 1000 h. In both aqueous dissolution studies there was minimal release of less than 0.8 wt.% of plutonium from the material. To examine the potential for recycling, the dissolution behavior of the fuel matrix was examined in acidic solutions: pure nitric acid and a nitric acid-hydrofluoric acid-peroxide solution. Both acidic media exhibit potential for dissolving plutonium from the zirconia matrix. The experiments performed in this study are meant to lay a foundation for the chemical performance of zirconia-magnesia inert matrix fuel containing fissile material and burnable poison.","","","Idaho National Lab.

The transformation of a divalent into a tetravalent constituent is expected to affect the long-term structural and chemical stability of this solid. Computational methods of electronic structure theory, specifically the density functional theory (DFT) within the supercell model, are used to predict the thermodynamic stability and electronic states of interstitial and Sr- or Ti-substituted Zr atoms in the STO lattice. Native defects such as vacancies and antisites are also considered. When Zr replaces Sr, its most stable configuration is to simply occupy the Sr site (instead of, for example, replacing a Ti and displacing the Ti to the Sr site.) For Zr added to the lattice, its most stable configuration is to replace a Ti, making a ZrTi impurity plus a Ti interstitial (as opposed to the Zr just remaining as an interstitial atom.) ZrSr is predicted to be a double electron donor, ZrTi is electrically inactive and interstitial Zr and Ti are predicted to be quadruple donors, with all donor levels in the conduction band. ZrSr and the tetravalent interstitials are all predicted to increase the crystal volume, and the interstitials also are predicted to lead to a tetragonal distortion of the lattice.

The U.S. Department of Energy hired WRPS to manage 56 million gallons of high-level radioactive waste stored in 177 underground tanks. The waste is the legacy of 45 years of plutonium production for the U. S. nuclear arsenal. WRPS mission is three-fold: safely manage the waste until it can be processed and immobilized; develop the tools and techniques to retrieve the waste from the tanks, and build the infrastructure needed to deliver the waste to the Waste Treatment Plant (WTP) when it begins operating. WTP will 'vitrify' the waste by mixing it with silica and other materials and heating it in an electric melter. Vitrification turns the waste into a sturdy glass that will isolate the radioactivity from the environment. It will take more than 20 years to process all the tank waste. The tank waste is a complex highly radioactive mixture of liquid, sludge and solids. The radioactivity, chemical composition of the waste and the limited access to the underground storage tanks makes retrieval a challenge. Waste is being retrieved from aging single-shell tanks and transferred to newer, safer double-shell tanks. WRPS is using a new technology known as enhanced-reach sluicing to remove waste. A high-pressure stream of liquid is sprayed at 100 gallons per minute through a telescoping arm onto a hard waste layer several inches thick covering the waste. The waste is broken up, moved to a central pump suction and removed from the tank. The innovative Mobile Arm Retrieval System (MARS) is also being used to retrieve waste. MARS is a remotely operated, telescoping arm installed on a mast in the center of the tank. It uses multiple technologies to scrape, scour and rake the waste toward a pump for removal. The American Reinvestment and Recovery Act (ARRA) provided nearly $326 million over two-and-a-half years to modernize the infrastructure in Hanford's tank farms. WRPS issued 850 subcontracts totaling more than $152 million with nearly 76 percent of that total awarded to small businesses. WRPS used the funding to upgrade tank farm infrastructure, develop technologies to retrieve and consolidate tank waste and extend the life of two critical operating facilities needed to feed waste to the WTP. The 222-S Laboratory analyzes waste to support waste retrievals and transfers. The laboratory was upgraded to support future WTP operations with a new computer system, new analytical equipment, a new office building and a new climate-controlled warehouse. The 242-A Evaporator was upgraded with a control-room simulator for operator training and several upgrades to aging equipment. The facility is used to remove liquid from the tank waste, creating additional storage space, necessary for continued waste retrievals and WTP operation. The One System Integrated Project Team is ajoint effort ofWRPS and Bechtel National to identify and resolve common issues associated with commissioning, feeding and operating the Waste Treatment Plant. Two new facilities are being designed to support WTP hot commlsslomng. The Interim Hanford Storage project is planned to store canisters of immobilized high-level radioactive waste glass produced by the vitrification plant. The facility will use open racks to store the 15-foot long, two-foot diameter canisters of waste, which require remote handling. The Secondary Liquid Waste Treatment Project is a major upgrade to the existing Effluent Treatment Facility at Hanford so it can treat about 10 million gallons of liquid radioactive and hazardous effluent a year from the vitrification plant. The One System approach brings the staff of both companies together to identify and resolve WTP safety issues. A questioning attitude is encouraged and an open forum is maintained for employees to raise issues. WRPS is completing its mission safely with record-setting safety performance. Since WRPS took over the Hanford Tank Operations Contract in October 2008, the recordable injury rate has decreased 43 percent, while the lost work-days rate decreased by 30 percent. The company recently surpassed three million hours worked without a lost workday accident.","","","Hanford Site (HNF), Richland, WA (United States)","USDOE Office of Environmental Management (EM)","","United States","2012-02-21T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: PRE-PUBLICATION - FOR INCLUSION IN THE TRI-CITY HERALD PROGRESS EDITION","","Medium: ED","","WRPS-51908","DE-AC27-08RV14800","TRN: US1201748","","","2012-12-05T00:00:00Z","1038047","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/1038047","https://www.osti.gov/servlets/purl/1038047","PRE-PUBLICATION - FOR INCLUSION IN THE TRI-CITY HERALD PROGRESS EDITION","",""

Black-Right-Pointing-Pointer We investigate the performance and reproducibility of composting on a small scale. Black-Right-Pointing-Pointer Thermophilic conditions are established by self-heating in all replicates. Black-Right-Pointing-Pointer Biochemical transformations, organic matter losses and stabilisation are realistic. Black-Right-Pointing-Pointer The organic matter evolution exhibits good reproducibility for all six replicates. - Abstract: Small-scale reactors (<10 l) have been employed in composting research, but few attempts have assessed the performance of composting considering the transformations of organic matter. Moreover, composting at small scales is often performed by imposing a fixed temperature, thus creating artificial conditions, and the reproducibility of composting has rarely been reported. The objectives of this study are to design an innovative small-scale composting device safeguarding self-heating to drive the composting process and to assess the performance and reproducibility of composting in small-scale pilots. The experimental setup included six 4-l reactors used for composting a mixture of sewage sludge and green wastes. The performance of the process was assessed by monitoring the temperature, O{sub 2} consumption and CO{sub 2} emissions, and characterising the biochemical evolution of organic matter. A good reproducibility was found for the six replicates with coefficients of variation for all parameters generally lower than 19%. An intense self-heating ensured the existence of a spontaneous thermophilic phase in all reactors. The average loss of total organic matter (TOM) was 46% of the initial content. Compared to the initial mixture, the hot water soluble fraction decreased by 62%, the hemicellulose-like fraction by 68%, the cellulose-like fraction by 50% and the lignin-like fractions by 12% in the final compost. The TOM losses, compost stabilisation and evolution of the biochemical fractions were similar to observed in large reactors or on-site experiments, excluding the lignin degradation, which was less important than in full-scale systems. The reproducibility of the process and the quality of the final compost make it possible to propose the use of this experimental device for research requiring a mass reduction of the initial composted waste mixtures.","","Available from http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.wasman.2011.09.011","","","","United States","2012-02-15T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: Waste Management; Journal Volume: 32; Journal Issue: 2; Other Information: Copyright (c) 2011 Elsevier Science B.V., Amsterdam, The Netherlands, All rights reserved.; Country of input: International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA)","","Medium: X; Size: page(s) 271-277","","","","Journal ID: ISSN 0956-053X; CODEN: WAMAE2; PII: S0956-053X(11)00392-8; TRN: US12R4001095056","10.1016/J.WASMAN.2011.09.011","","2013-03-14T00:00:00Z","22004951","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/22004951","","Waste Management","2","32"

Black-Right-Pointing-Pointer Measurement errors for tracer gases were 1-3% in landfill gas. Black-Right-Pointing-Pointer Background signals from landfill gas result in elevated limits of detection. Black-Right-Pointing-Pointer Technique is much less expensive and easier to use than GC. - Abstract: Gas tracer tests can be used to determine gas flow patterns within landfills, quantify volatile contaminant residence time, and measure water within refuse. While gas chromatography (GC) has been traditionally used to analyze gas tracers in refuse, photoacoustic spectroscopy (PAS) might allow real-time measurements with reduced personnel costs and greater mobility and ease of use. Laboratory and field experiments were conducted to evaluate the efficacy of PAS for conducting gas tracer tests in landfills. Two tracer gases, difluoromethane (DFM) and sulfur hexafluoride (SF{sub 6}), were measured with a commercial PAS instrument. Relative measurement errors were invariant with tracer concentration but influenced by background gas: errors were 1-3% in landfill gas but 4-5% in air. Two partitioning gas tracer tests were conducted in an aerobic landfill, and limits of detection (LODs) were 3-4 times larger for DFM with PAS versus GC due to temporal changes in background signals. While higher LODs can be compensated by injecting larger tracer mass, changes in background signals increased the uncertainty in measured water saturations by up to 25% over comparable GC methods. PAS has distinct advantages over GC with respect to personnel costs and ease of use, although for field applications GC analyses of select samples are recommended to quantify instrument interferences.","","Available from http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.wasman.2011.09.016","","","","United States","2012-02-15T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: Waste Management; Journal Volume: 32; Journal Issue: 2; Other Information: DOI: 10.1016/j.wasman.2011.09.016; PII: S0956-053X(11)00397-7; Copyright (c) 2011 Elsevier Science B.V., Amsterdam, The Netherlands, All rights reserved.; Country of input: International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA)","","Medium: X; Size: page(s) 297-304","","","","Journal ID: ISSN 0956-053X; WAMAE2; TRN: US12R4002091592","10.1016/j.wasman.2011.09.016","","2012-12-11T00:00:00Z","21612938","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/21612938","","Waste Management","2","32"

Black-Right-Pointing-Pointer The batch biodegradation rate and the rate obtained by inverse modeling differed by a factor of {approx}2. Black-Right-Pointing-Pointer Tracer tests showed the importance of hydrodynamic parameters to improve model estimates. - Abstract: An assessment of the risk to human health and the environment associated with the presence of organic contaminants (OCs) in landfills necessitates reliable predictive models. The overall objectives of this study were to (1) conduct column experiments to measure the fate and transport of an OC in a simulated solid waste mixture, (2) compare the results of column experiments to model predictions using HYDRUS-1D (version 4.13), a contaminant fate and transport model that can be parameterized to simulate the laboratory experimental system, and (3) determine model input parameters from independently conducted batch experiments. Experiments were conducted in which sorption only and sorption plus biodegradation influenced OC transport. HYDRUS-1D can reasonably simulate the fate and transport of phenol in an anaerobic and fully saturated waste column in which biodegradation and sorption are the prevailing fate processes. The agreement between model predictions and column data was imperfect (i.e., within a factor of two) for the sorption plus biodegradation test and the error almost certainly lies in the difficulty of measuring a biodegradation rate that is applicable to the column conditions. Nevertheless, a biodegradation rate estimate that is within a factor of two or even five may be adequate in the context of a landfill, given the extended retention time and the fact that leachate release will be controlled by the infiltration rate which can be minimized by engineering controls.","","Available from http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.wasman.2011.09.017","","","","United States","2012-02-15T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: Waste Management; Journal Volume: 32; Journal Issue: 2; Other Information: DOI: 10.1016/j.wasman.2011.09.017; PII: S0956-053X(11)00423-5; Copyright (c) 2011 Elsevier Science B.V., Amsterdam, The Netherlands, All rights reserved.; Country of input: International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA)","","Medium: X; Size: page(s) 327-334","","","","Journal ID: ISSN 0956-053X; WAMAE2; TRN: US12R4003091593","10.1016/j.wasman.2011.09.017","","2012-12-11T00:00:00Z","21612939","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/21612939","","Waste Management","2","32"

Black-Right-Pointing-Pointer WEEE generation of 3.77 kg/capita year for 2008 is estimated. Black-Right-Pointing-Pointer Use of constant lifetime should be avoided for non-mature market products. - Abstract: Sales of electrical and electronic equipment are increasing dramatically in developing countries. Usually, there are no reliable data about quantities of the waste generated. A new law for solid waste management was enacted in Brazil in 2010, and the infrastructure to treat this waste must be planned, considering the volumes of the different types of electrical and electronic equipment generated. This paper reviews the literature regarding estimation of waste electrical and electronic equipment (WEEE), focusing on developing countries, particularly in Latin America. It briefly describes the current WEEE system in Brazil and presents an updated estimate of generation of WEEE. Considering the limited available data in Brazil, a model for WEEE generation estimation is proposed in which different methods are used for mature and non-mature market products. The results showed that the most important variable is the equipment lifetime, which requires a thorough understanding of consumer behavior to estimate. Since Brazil is a rapidly expanding market, the 'boom' in waste generation is still to come. In the near future, better data will provide more reliable estimation of waste generation and a clearer interpretation of the lifetime variable throughout the years.","","Available from http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.wasman.2011.09.020","","","","United States","2012-02-15T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: Waste Management; Journal Volume: 32; Journal Issue: 2; Other Information: DOI: 10.1016/j.wasman.2011.09.020; PII: S0956-053X(11)00426-0; Copyright (c) 2011 Elsevier Science B.V., Amsterdam, The Netherlands, All rights reserved.; Country of input: International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA)","","Medium: X; Size: page(s) 335-342","","","","Journal ID: ISSN 0956-053X; WAMAE2; TRN: US12R4004091594","10.1016/j.wasman.2011.09.020","","2012-12-11T00:00:00Z","21612940","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/21612940","","Waste Management","2","32"

During dry transportation or at the beginning of dry storage, the cladding is expected to be submitted to creep deformation under the hoop stress induced by the internal pressure of the fuel rod. The thermal creep is a potential mechanism that might lead to cladding failure. A new creep model was developed, based on a database of creep tests on as-received and irradiated cold-worked stress-relieved Zircaloy-4 cladding in a wide range of temperatures (310 degrees C to 470 degrees C) and hoop stress (80 to 260 MPa). Based on three laws-a flow law, a strain-hardening recovery law, and an annealing of irradiation hardening law this model allows the simulation of not only the transient creep and the steady-state creep, but also the early creep acceleration observed on irradiated samples tested in severe conditions, which was not taken into account in the previous models. The extrapolation of the creep model in the conditions of very long-term creep tests is reassuring, proving the robustness of the chosen formalism. The creep model has been assessed in progressively decreasing stress conditions, more representative of a transport. Set up to predict the cladding creep behavior under variable temperature and stress conditions, this model can easily be implemented into codes in order to simulate the thermomechanical behavior of spent fuel rods in various scenarios of postirradiation phases.

This study investigated the usability of HyMap airborne hyperspectral remote sensing data (126 bands at 2.3 x 2.3 m spatial resolution) to characterize the vegetation at U.S. Department of Energy uranium processing sites near Monticello, Utah and Monument Valley, Arizona. Grass and shrub species were mixed on an engineered disposal cell cover at the Monticello site while shrub species were dominant in the phytoremediation plantings at the Monument Valley site. The specific objectives of this study were to: (1) estimate leaf-area-index (LAI) of the vegetation using three different methods (i.e., vegetation indices, red-edge positioning (REP), and machine learning regression trees), and (2) map the vegetation cover using machine learning decision trees based on either the scaled reflectance data or mixture tuned matched filtering (MTMF)-derived metrics and vegetation indices. Regression trees resulted in the best calibration performance of LAI estimation (R{sup 2} &gt; 0.80). The use of REPs failed to accurately predict LAI (R{sup 2} &lt; 0.2). The use of the MTMF-derived metrics (matched filter scores and infeasibility) and a range of vegetation indices in decision trees improved the vegetation mapping when compared to the decision tree classification using just the scaled reflectance. Results suggest that hyperspectral imagery are useful for characterizing biophysical characteristics (LAI) and vegetation cover on capped hazardous waste sites. However, it is believed that the vegetation mapping would benefit from the use of 1 higher spatial resolution hyperspectral data due to the small size of many of the vegetation patches (&lt; 1m) found on the sites.","","available","Savannah River Site (SRS), Aiken, SC (United States)","USDOE","","United States","2012-01-17T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: Remote Sensing","","Medium: ED","","SRNL-MS-2012-00004","DE-AC09-08SR22470","Journal ID: ISSN 2072-4292; TRN: US1200746","","","2012-12-05T00:00:00Z","1034115","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/1034115","https://www.osti.gov/servlets/purl/1034115","Remote Sensing","",""

Since this unusual form of water only exists on earth in laboratories with highly specialized equipment, it is fair to ask why there is any interest in studying this esoteric material. Much of the scientific interest involves using ASW as a model system to explore the physical and reactive properties of liquid water and aqueous solutions. Other researchers are interested in ASW because it is believed to be the predominate form of water in the extreme cold temperatures found in many astrophysical and planetary environments. In addition, ASW is a convenient model system for studying the stability of metastable systems (glasses) and the properties of highly porous materials. A fundamental understanding of such properties has applications in a diverse range of disciplines including cryobiology, food science, pharmaceuticals, astrophysics and nuclear waste storage among others.There exist several excellent reviews on the properties of ASW and supercooled liquid water and a new comprehensive review is beyond the scope of this Account. Instead, we focus on our research over the past 15 years using molecular beams and surface science techniques to probe the thermal and non thermal properties of nanoscale films of ASW. We use molecular beams to precisely control the deposition conditions (flux, incident, energy, incident angle) to create compositionally-tailored, nanoscale films of ASW at low temperatures. To study the transport properties (viscosity, diffusivity), the amorphous films can be heated above their glass transition temperatures, Tg, at which time they transform into deeply supercooled liquids prior to crystallization. The advantage of this approach is that at temperatures near Tg the viscosity is approximately 15 orders of magnitude larger than a normal liquid, and therefore the crystallization kinetics are dramatically slowed, increasing the time available for experiments. For example, near Tg, on a typical laboratory time scale (e.g. {approx}1000 s), a water molecule moves less than a molecular distance. For this reason, nanoscale films help to probe the behavior and reactions of supercooled liquid at these low temperatures. ASW films can be used for investigating the non-thermal reactions relevant to radiolysis. In this account we will present a survey of our research on the thermal and non thermal properties of ASW using this approach.","","","Pacific Northwest National Lab.

Black-Right-Pointing-Pointer Biogas production of the whole waste decreased at 175 Degree-Sign C due to formation of refractory compounds. Black-Right-Pointing-Pointer Pretreatment to 145 Degree-Sign C and 175 Degree-Sign C were the best when considering only the free liquid fraction. Black-Right-Pointing-Pointer H{sub 2}O{sub 2} pretreatment had a lag phase and the biogas production was not higher than MW pretreated samples. - Abstract: In order to enhance anaerobic digestion (AD) of the organic fraction of municipal solid waste (OFMSW), pretreatment combining two modalities, microwave (MW) heating in presence or absence of hydrogen peroxide (H{sub 2}O{sub 2}) were investigated. The main pretreatment variables affecting the characteristics of the OFMSW were temperature (T) via MW irradiation and supplemental water additions of 20% and 30% (SWA20 and SW30). Subsequently, the focus of this study was to evaluate mesophilic batch AD performance in terms of biogas production, as well as changes in the characteristics of the OFMSW post digestion. A high MW induced temperature range (115-175 Degree-Sign C) was applied, using sealed vessels and a bench scale MW unit equipped with temperature and pressure controls. Biochemical methane potential (BMP) tests were conducted on the whole OFMSW as well as the liquid fractions. The whole OFMSW pretreated at 115 Degree-Sign C and 145 Degree-Sign C showed 4-7% improvement in biogas production over untreated OFMSW (control). When pretreated at 175 Degree-Sign C, biogas production decreased due to formation of refractory compounds, inhibiting the digestion. For the liquid fraction of OFMSW, the effect of pretreatment on the cumulative biogas production (CBP) was more pronounced for SWA20 at 145 Degree-Sign C, with a 26% increase in biogas production after 8 days of digestion, compared to the control. When considering the increased substrate availability in the liquid fraction after MW pretreatment, a 78% improvement in biogas production vs. the control was achieved. Combining MW and H{sub 2}O{sub 2} modalities did not have a positive impact on OFMSW stabilization and enhanced biogas production. In general, all samples pretreated with H{sub 2}O{sub 2} displayed a long lag phase and the CBP was usually lower than MW irradiated only samples. First order rate constant was calculated.","","Available from http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.wasman.2011.08.012","","","","United States","2012-01-15T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: Waste Management; Journal Volume: 32; Journal Issue: 1; Other Information: DOI: 10.1016/j.wasman.2011.08.012; PII: S0956-053X(11)00372-2; Copyright (c) 2011 Elsevier Science B.V., Amsterdam, The Netherlands, All rights reserved.; Country of input: International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA)","","Medium: X; Size: page(s) 41-52","","","","Journal ID: ISSN 0956-053X; WAMAE2; TRN: US12R3989091580","10.1016/j.wasman.2011.08.012","","2012-12-11T00:00:00Z","21612926","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/21612926","","Waste Management","1","32"

Black-Right-Pointing-Pointer Consideration of metal recovery from other middle-sized WEEE is still important. - Abstract: In Japan, waste electrical and electronic equipment (WEEE) that is not covered by the recycling laws are treated as municipal solid waste. A part of common metals are recovered during the treatment; however, other metals are rarely recovered and their destinations are not clear. This study investigated the distribution ratios and substance flows of 55 metals contained in WEEE during municipal waste treatment using shredding and separation techniques at a Japanese municipal waste treatment plant. The results revealed that more than half of Cu and most of Al contained in WEEE end up in landfills or dissipate under the current municipal waste treatment system. Among the other metals contained in WEEE, at least 70% of the mass was distributed to the small-grain fraction through the shredding and separation and is to be landfilled. Most kinds of metals were concentrated several fold in the small-grain fraction through the process and therefore the small-grain fraction may be a next target for recovery of metals in terms of both metal content and amount. Separate collection and pre-sorting of small digital products can work as effective way for reducing precious metals and less common metals to be landfilled to some extent; however, much of the total masses of those metals would still end up in landfills and it is also important to consider how to recover and utilize metals contained in other WEEE such as audio/video equipment.","","Available from http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.wasman.2011.09.012","","","","United States","2012-01-15T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: Waste Management; Journal Volume: 32; Journal Issue: 1; Other Information: DOI: 10.1016/j.wasman.2011.09.012; PII: S0956-053X(11)00393-X; Copyright (c) 2011 Elsevier Science B.V., Amsterdam, The Netherlands, All rights reserved.; Country of input: International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA)","","Medium: X; Size: page(s) 96-103","","","","Journal ID: ISSN 0956-053X; WAMAE2; TRN: US12R3993091584","10.1016/j.wasman.2011.09.012","","2012-12-11T00:00:00Z","21612930","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/21612930","","Waste Management","1","32"

Due to recent legislation this practice is no longer a viable method of waste management. It is necessary to improve existing and develop new sludge management techniques and one promising alternative is the dewatering and treatment of sludge in constructed wetlands. The aim of this study was to follow reduction of organic carbon, BOD and nutrients in an industrial sludge containing nitro-aromatic compounds passing through constructed small-scale wetlands, and to investigate any toxic effect such as growth inhibition of the common reed Phragmites australis. The result showed high reduction of all tested parameters in all the outgoing water samples, which shows that constructed wetlands are suitable for carbon and nutrient removal. The results also showed that P. australis is tolerant to xenobiotics and did not appear to be affected by the toxic compounds in the sludge. The sludge residual on the top of the beds contained low levels of organic carbon and is considered non-organic and could therefore be landfilled. Using this type of secondary treatment method, the amount of sludge could be reduced by 50-70%, mainly by dewatering and biodegradation of organic compounds.","","Available from http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.wasman.2011.08.016","","","","United States","2012-01-15T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: Waste Management; Journal Volume: 32; Journal Issue: 1; Other Information: DOI: 10.1016/j.wasman.2011.08.016; PII: S0956-053X(11)00376-X; Copyright (c) 2011 Elsevier Science B.V., Amsterdam, The Netherlands, All rights reserved.; Country of input: International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA)","","Medium: X; Size: page(s) 104-109","","","","Journal ID: ISSN 0956-053X; WAMAE2; TRN: US12R3994091585","10.1016/j.wasman.2011.08.016","","2012-12-11T00:00:00Z","21612931","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/21612931","","Waste Management","1","32"

Black-Right-Pointing-Pointer The threshold of the SCOD/TAN ratio was 2.4 at an influent pH of 8.5-9. - Abstract: The effect of ammonia inhibition was evaluated during the enhanced anaerobic treatment of digested effluent from a 700 m{sup 3} chicken-manure continuous stirred tank reactor (CSTR). A 12.3 L internal circulation (IC) reactor inoculated with an anaerobic granular sludge and operated at 35 {+-} 1 Degree-Sign C was employed for the investigation. With a corresponding organic loading rate of 1.5-3.5 kg-COD/m{sup 3} d over a hydraulic retention time of 1.5 d, a maximum volumetric biogas production rate of 1.2 m{sup 3}/m{sup 3} d and TCOD (total COD) removal efficiency ranging from 70% to 80% was achieved. However, the continual increase in the influent TAN content led to ammonia inhibition in the methanogenesis system. The SCOD/TAN (soluble COD/total ammonia nitrogen) ratio was presented to be the key controlling factor for the anaerobic treatment of semi-digested chicken manure, and further validation through shock loading and ammonia inhibition experiments was conducted. The threshold value of the SCOD/TAN ratio was determined to be 2.4 (corresponding to a TAN of 1250 mg/L) at an influent pH of 8.5-9.","","Available from http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.wasman.2011.09.015","","","","United States","2012-01-15T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: Waste Management; Journal Volume: 32; Journal Issue: 1; Other Information: DOI: 10.1016/j.wasman.2011.09.015; PII: S0956-053X(11)00396-5; Copyright (c) 2011 Elsevier Science B.V., Amsterdam, The Netherlands, All rights reserved.; Country of input: International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA)","","Medium: X; Size: page(s) 137-143","","","","Journal ID: ISSN 0956-053X; WAMAE2; TRN: US12R3995091586","","","2012-12-11T00:00:00Z","21612932","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/21612932","","Waste Management","1","32"

Black-Right-Pointing-Pointer Early loss and stochastic return are included for fast and slow cycling products. Black-Right-Pointing-Pointer The reuse-to-input flow ratio (Internal Cycle Factor, ICF) is determined. Black-Right-Pointing-Pointer The cycle rate, which is increasing with the ICF, monitors eco-performance. Black-Right-Pointing-Pointer Early internal cycle losses diminish the ICF, the cycle rate and performance. - Abstract: Dynamic annual flow models incorporating consumer discard and usage loss and featuring deterministic and stochastic end-of-cycle (EOC) return by the consumer are developed for reused or remanufactured products (multiple cycle products, MCPs), including fast and slow cycling, short and long-lived products. It is shown that internal flows (reuse and overall consumption) increase proportionally to the dimensionless internal cycle factor (ICF) which is related to environmental impact reduction factors. The combined reuse/recycle (or cycle) rate is shown capable for shortcut, albeit effective, monitoring of environmental performance in terms of waste production, virgin material extraction and manufacturing impacts of all MCPs, a task, which physical variables (lifetime, cycling frequency, mean or total number of return trips) and conventional rates, via which environmental policy has been officially implemented (e.g. recycling rate) cannot accomplish. The cycle rate is shown to be an increasing (hyperbolic) function of ICF. The impact of the stochastic EOC return characteristics on total reuse and consumption flows, as well as on eco-performance, is assessed: symmetric EOC return has a small, positive effect on performance compared to deterministic, while early shifted EOC return is more beneficial. In order to be efficient, environmental policy should set higher minimum reuse targets for higher trippage MCPs. The results may serve for monitoring, flow accounting and comparative eco-assessment of MCPs. They may be useful in identifying reachable and efficient reuse/recycle targets for consumer products and in planning return via appropriate labelling and digital coding for enhancing environmental performance, while satisfying consumer demand.","","Available from http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.wasman.2011.08.005","","","","United States","2012-01-15T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: Waste Management; Journal Volume: 32; Journal Issue: 1; Other Information: DOI: 10.1016/j.wasman.2011.08.005; PII: S0956-053X(11)00363-1; Copyright (c) 2011 Elsevier Science B.V., Amsterdam, The Netherlands, All rights reserved.; Country of input: International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA)","","Medium: X; Size: page(s) 177-193","","","","Journal ID: ISSN 0956-053X; WAMAE2; TRN: US12R3997091588","10.1016/j.wasman.2011.08.005","","2012-12-11T00:00:00Z","21612934","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/21612934","","Waste Management","1","32"

Cost benefit analysis is a widely used method, in which the investments are mainly assessed through the calculation of their evaluation indicators, namely benefit/cost (B/C) ratios, as well as the quantification of their financial, technical, environmental and social risks. Herein, a novel approach in the form of risk-based multi-criteria assessment (RBMCA) is introduced, which can be used by decision makers, in order to select the optimum alternative of a waste management project. Specifically, decision makers use multiple criteria, which are based on the cumulative probability distribution functions of the alternatives' B/C ratios. The RBMCA system is used for the evaluation of a waste incineration project's alternatives, where the correlation between the criteria weight values and the decision makers' risk preferences is analyzed and useful conclusions are discussed.","","Available from http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.wasman.2011.09.001","","","","United States","2012-01-15T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: Waste Management; Journal Volume: 32; Journal Issue: 1; Other Information: DOI: 10.1016/j.wasman.2011.09.001; PII: S0956-053X(11)00378-3; Copyright (c) 2011 Elsevier Science B.V., Amsterdam, The Netherlands, All rights reserved.; Country of input: International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA)","","Medium: X; Size: page(s) 194-212","","","","Journal ID: ISSN 0956-053X; WAMAE2; TRN: US12R3998091589","10.1016/j.wasman.2011.09.001","","2012-12-11T00:00:00Z","21612935","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/21612935","","Waste Management","1","32"

The region of Attica is home to almost half the population of Greece and the management of its waste is a major issue. In order to explicitly analyze the operation of the MBT plant, five scenarios were generated. Actual operation data of the MBT plant for the year 2008 were provided by the region of Attica and the LCA modeling was performed via the SimaPro 5.1 software while impact assessment was performed utilizing the Eco-indicator'99 method. The results of our analysis indicate that even the current operation of the MBT plant is preferable to landfilling. Among the scenarios of MBT operation, the one with complete utilization of the MBT outputs, i.e. compost, RDF, ferrous and non-ferrous metals, is the one that generates the most environmental gains. Our analysis indicates that the exploitation of RDF via incineration is the key factor towards improving the environmental performance of the MBT plant. Our findings provide a quantitative understanding of the MBT plant. Interpretation of results showed that proper operation of the modern waste management systems can lead to substantial reduction of environmental impacts and savings of resources.","","Available from http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.wasman.2011.09.002","","","","United States","2012-01-15T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: Waste Management; Journal Volume: 32; Journal Issue: 1; Other Information: DOI: 10.1016/j.wasman.2011.09.002; PII: S0956-053X(11)00380-1; Copyright (c) 2011 Elsevier Science B.V., Amsterdam, The Netherlands, All rights reserved.; Country of input: International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA)","","Medium: X; Size: page(s) 213-219","","","","Journal ID: ISSN 0956-053X; WAMAE2; TRN: US12R3999091590","10.1016/j.wasman.2011.09.002","","2012-12-11T00:00:00Z","21612936","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/21612936","","Waste Management","1","32"

Moreover, technical levels of scrap tire recycling and food waste recycling should be improved to produce positive effects on reducing more material flows. Fly ash recycling for cement production has negative effects on reducing all material flows except solid wastes. Thus, other fly ash utilization methods should be exploited. In addition, the utilization and treatment of secondary wastes from food waste recycling and sludge recycling should be concerned.","","Available from http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.wasman.2011.08.018","","","","United States","2012-01-15T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: Waste Management; Journal Volume: 32; Journal Issue: 1; Other Information: DOI: 10.1016/j.wasman.2011.08.018; PII: S0956-053X(11)00379-5; Copyright (c) 2011 Elsevier Science B.V., Amsterdam, The Netherlands, All rights reserved.; Country of input: International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA)","","Medium: X; Size: page(s) 220-225","","","","Journal ID: ISSN 0956-053X; WAMAE2; TRN: US12R4000091591","10.1016/j.wasman.2011.08.018","","2012-12-11T00:00:00Z","21612937","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/21612937","","Waste Management","1","32"

Black-Right-Pointing-Pointer Results were compared with C mineralization during 90-day incubation, FTIR and {sup 13}C NMR. Black-Right-Pointing-Pointer Thermal analysis reflected the differences between the organic wastes before and after the incubation. Black-Right-Pointing-Pointer The calculated energy density showed a strong correlation with cumulative respiration. Black-Right-Pointing-Pointer Conventional and thermal methods provide complimentary means of characterizing organic wastes. - Abstract: The use of organic municipal wastes as soil amendments is an increasing practice that can divert significant amounts of waste from landfill, and provides a potential source of nutrients and organic matter to ameliorate degraded soils. Due to the high heterogeneity of organic municipal waste streams, it is difficult to rapidly and cost-effectively establish their suitability as soil amendments using a single method. Thermal analysis has been proposed as an evolving technique to assess the stability and composition of the organic matter present in these wastes. In this study, three different organic municipal waste streams (i.e., a municipal waste compost (MC), a composted sewage sludge (CS) and a thermally dried sewage sludge (TS)) were characterized using conventional and thermal methods. The conventional methods used to test organic matter stability included laboratory incubation with measurement of respired C, and spectroscopic methods to characterize chemical composition. Carbon mineralization was measured during a 90-day incubation, and samples before and after incubation were analyzed by chemical (elemental analysis) and spectroscopic (infrared and nuclear magnetic resonance) methods. Results were compared with those obtained by thermogravimetry (TG) and differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) techniques. Total amounts of CO{sub 2} respired indicated that the organic matter in the TS was the least stable, while that in the CS was the most stable. This was confirmed by changes detected with the spectroscopic methods in the composition of the organic wastes due to C mineralization. Differences were especially pronounced for TS, which showed a remarkable loss of aliphatic and proteinaceous compounds during the incubation process. TG, and especially DSC analysis, clearly reflected these differences between the three organic wastes before and after the incubation. Furthermore, the calculated energy density, which represents the energy available per unit of organic matter, showed a strong correlation with cumulative respiration. Results obtained support the hypothesis of a potential link between the thermal and biological stability of the studied organic materials, and consequently the ability of thermal analysis to characterize the maturity of municipal organic wastes and composts.","","Available from http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.wasman.2011.08.011","","","","United States","2012-01-15T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: Waste Management; Journal Volume: 32; Journal Issue: 1; Other Information: DOI: 10.1016/j.wasman.2011.08.011; PII: S0956-053X(11)00371-0; Copyright (c) 2011 Elsevier Science B.V., Amsterdam, The Netherlands, All rights reserved.; Country of input: International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA)","","Medium: X; Size: page(s) 158-164","","","","Journal ID: ISSN 0956-053X; WAMAE2; TRN: US12R3996091587","10.1016/j.wasman.2011.08.011","","2012-12-11T00:00:00Z","21612933","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/21612933","","Waste Management","1","32"

In this study, STO is used as a model material to simulate a waste form for disposal of radioactive 90Sr that decays to 90Y and subsequently to 90Zr by emission of beta particles. Sequential implantation of 16O+ and 90Zr+ ions was performed at 550 K to balance the charge and to avoid full amorphization of STO. A number of experimental methods have been employed to characterize the implanted sample, including multiaxial ion channeling analysis and high-resolution x-ray diffraction. Results show that a high defect concentration was generated and accumulated in STO during the ion implantation, but the crystal structure was not rendered fully amorphous even for an atomic percentage of implanted O and Zr up to 1.5 at.% each. Thermal annealing at 1273 K leads to significant defect recovery at the surface with little recovery occurring at the damage peak, where a modest recovery is observed upon further annealing at 1423 K. Some of the implanted Zr species are well aligned with the STO <001> axis, but all are barely located at the substitutional sites. A minor phase with a tetragonal structure is observed in the Zr distributed region, which has the <001> axis parallel to that of the STO host. The tetragonal phase survives annealing at 1423 K with only a small decrease in the c value. A general assessment of this model waste form is also provided in this report.","","","Pacific Northwest National Lab. (PNNL), Richland, WA (United States). Environmental Molecular Sciences Lab.

Large-scale atomic models of freely diffusing multilayer smectite particles at low hydration confined in a silicalite cage are used to investigate water dynamics in the composite environment with the ReaxFF reactive force field over a temperature range of 300 647 K. The reactive capability of the force field enabled a range of relevant surface chemistry to emerge, including acid/base equilibria in the interlayer calcium hydrates and silanol formation on the edges of the clay and inner surface of the zeolite housing. After annealing, the resulting clay models exhibit both mono- and bilayer hydration structures. Clay surface hydration redistributed markedly and yielded to silicalite water loading. We find that the absolute rates and temperature dependence of water dynamics compare well to neutron scattering data and pulse field gradient measures from relevant samples of Ca-montmorillonite and silicalite, respectively. Within an atomistic, reactive context, our results distinguish water dynamics in the interlayer Ca(OH)2 nH2O environment from water flowing over the clay surface, and from water diffusing within silicalite. We find that the diffusion of water when complexed to Ca hydrates is considerably slower than freely diffusing water over the clay surface, and the reduced mobility is well described by a difference in the Arrhenius pre-exponential factor rather than a change in activation energy.","","","Oak Ridge National Lab.

The Market-oriented Optimal Range for PHEV (MOR-PHEV) model is developed to optimize the PHEV electric range for each of 36,664 sampled individuals representing U.S. new vehicle drivers. The optimization objective is the minimization of the sum of costs on battery, gasoline, electricity and refueling hassle. Assuming no battery subsidy, the empirical results suggest that: 1) the optimal PHEV electric range approximates two thirds of one s typical daily driving distance in the near term, defined as $450/kWh battery delivered price and $4/gallon gasoline price. 2) PHEVs are not ready to directly compete with HEVs at today s situation, defined by the $600/kWh battery delivered price and the $3-$4/gallon gasoline price, but can do so in the near term. 3) PHEV10s will be favored by the market over longer-range PHEVs in the near term, but longer-range PHEVs can dominate the PHEV market if gasoline prices reach as high as $5-$6 per gallon and/or battery delivered prices reach as low as $150-$300/kWh. 4) PHEVs can become much more attractive against HEVs in the near term if the electric range can be extended by only 10% with multiple charges per day, possible with improved charging infrastructure or adapted charging behavior. 5) the impact of a $100/kWh decrease in battery delivered prices on the competiveness of PHEVs against HEVs can be offset by about $1.25/gallon decrease in gasoline prices, or about 7/kWh increase in electricity prices. This also means that the impact of a $1/gallon decrease in gasoline prices can be offset by about 5/kWh decrease in electricity prices.","","","Oak Ridge National Lab.

Flooding of contaminated capillary fringe sediments due to seasonal changes in the Columbia River stage has been identified as a source for U supply to ground water. We investigated U release from Hanford capillary fringe sediments by packing sediments into reservoirs of centrifugal filter devices and saturated with Columbia River water for 3 to 84 days at varying solution-to-solid ratios. After specified times, samples were centrifuged. Within the first three days, there was an initial rapid release of 6-9% of total U, independent of the solution-to-solid ratio. After 14 days of reaction, however, the experiments with the narrowest solution-to-solid ratios showed a decline in dissolved U concentrations. The removal of U from the solution phase was accompanied by removal of Ca and HCO3-. Geochemical modeling indicated that calcite could precipitate in the narrowest solution-to-solid ratio experiment. After the rapid initial release in the first three days for the wide solution-to-solid ratio experiments, there was sustained release of U into the pore water. This sustained release of U from the sediments had diffusion-limited kinetics.","","","Oak Ridge National Lab.

In this work, we show from density functional theory that such halogen analogs of thiolated gold nanoclusters are highly likely. Using Au{sub 25}X{sub 18}{sup -} as an example, where X = F, Cl, Br, or I replaces -SR, we find that Au{sub 25}Cl{sub 18}{sup -} demonstrates a high similarity to Au{sub 25}(SR){sub 18}{sup -} by showing Au-Cl distances, Cl-Au-Cl angles, band gap, and frontier orbitals similar to those in Au{sub 25}(SR){sub 18}{sup -}. DFT-based global minimization also indicates the energetic preference of staple formation for the Au{sub 25}Cl{sub 18}{sup -} cluster. The similarity between Au{sub m}(SR){sub n} and Au{sub m}X{sub n} could be exploited to make viable Au{sub m}X{sub n} clusters and to predict structures for Au{sub m}(SR){sub n}.","","","Oak Ridge National Lab.
