"A tool for measuring the system cost of replacement energy","Steele, Amanda Harker; Sharma, Smriti; Pena Cabra, Ivonne; Clahane, Luke (ORCID:0000000290248661); Iyengar, Arun (ORCID:0000000260245785)","24 POWER TRANSMISSION AND DISTRIBUTION; total systems cost; system cost of replacement energy; electricity; decarbonization","Replacing legacy high carbon technologies (LHCTs) with new low carbon technologies (NLCTs), particularly NLCTs featuring variable renewable resources, can disproportionally influence the costs associated with maintaining a reliable and competent grid system. Traditional cost metrics and publicly available tools that make use of these metrics fail to capture the total systems cost (TSC) implications of such changes, highlighting the need for a tool that will capture these implications. This paper presents the results of a tool developed to estimate the System Cost of Replacement Energy (SCoRE) when NLCTs replace LHCTs in an operating region. The SCoRE estimates potential changes in the TSC resulting from the replacement. The SCoRE tool is applied to the Electric Reliability Council of Texas (ERCOT) operating region. LHCTs, namely coal- and natural gas-fired power plants are replaced by NLCTs including solar photovoltaics and wind, with and without energy storage, and coal and natural gas power plants equipped with carbon capture and storage (CCS). The results showcase the TSC implications of different replacement scenarios, which for ERCOT include larger increases in the TSC if LHCTs are replaced with wind and solar, in lieu of natural gas power plants equipped with CCS, for all decarbonization targets considered.","Elsevier","","National Energy Technology Laboratory (NETL), Pittsburgh, PA, Morgantown, WV, and Albany, OR (United States)","USDOE Office of Fossil Energy (FE)","","United Kingdom","2023-07-01T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: Energy Journal Volume: 275 Journal Issue: C","","Medium: X; Size: Article No. 127394","","DOE/NETL-2023/3859","FE0025912; FE00025912","Journal ID: ISSN 0360-5442; S0360544223007880; 127394; PII: S0360544223007880","10.1016/j.energy.2023.127394","","2023-04-21T00:00:00Z","1968955","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/1968955","","Energy","C","275"

Considering various ownership and privacy requirements of microgrids, utility directly interfaced distributed energy resources (DERs) and demand response, a distributed optimization is proposed for obtaining optimal network operational objectives with constraints satisfied through iteratively updated price signals. The alternating direction method of multipliers (ADMM) algorithm is utilized to solve the formulated distributed optimization. The proposed distributed energy management provides microgrids, utility-directly interfaced DERs and responsive demands the opportunity of contributing to better network operational objectives while preserving their privacy and autonomy. Results of numerical simulation using a networked microgrids system consisting of several microgrids, utility directly interfaced DERs and responsive demands validate the soundness and accuracy of the proposed distributed energy management. The proposed method is further tested on a practical two-microgrid system located in Adjuntas, Puerto Rico, and the applicability of the proposed strategy is validated through hardware-in-the-loop (HIL) testing.","MDPI","","Oak Ridge National Lab.

The current co-simulation is applied to Oakland and Alameda, California, and in future work will be extended to the full San Francisco Bay Area. It uses the HELICS co-simulation framework to enable parallel instances of vetted grid and transportation software programs to interact at every model timestep, allowing high-fidelity simulations at a large scale. This enables not only the impacts of electrified transportation systems across a larger interconnected collection of distribution feeders to be evaluated, but also the feedbacks between the two systems, such as through control systems, to be captured and compared. The findings are that with moderate passenger EV adoption rates, inverter controls combined with some distribution system hardware upgrades can maintain grid voltages within ANSI C.84 range A limits of 0.95 to 1.05 p.u. without smart charging. However, EV charging control may be required for higher levels of charging or to reduce grid upgrades, and this will be explored in future work.</p>","MDPI AG","","National Renewable Energy Lab.

"Day-ahead continuous double auction-based peer-to-peer energy trading platform incorporating trading losses and network utilisation fee","Liaquat, Sheroze; Hussain, Tanveer; Celik, Berk; Fourney, Robert; Hansen, Timothy M.","24 POWER TRANSMISSION AND DISTRIBUTION; peer-to-peer (P2P) energy trading; distributed energy resources; energy management; microgrid; nanogrid; power markets; weather forecasting","Integration of distributed energy resources, such as photovoltaic solar (PV), introduces new opportunities to establish local energy market frameworks to improve renewable energy utilisation in residential sectors. Such peer-to-peer (P2P) energy trading refers to a local market structure where customers (and prosumers) interact to share excess PV generation to enhance the individual and community social welfare. In this work, a day-ahead continuous double auction (CDA)-based P2P market structure considering network losses and network utilisation fees was designed. Day-ahead PV energy is modelled using fractional integral polynomials and the output is forecasted using an autoregressive integrated moving average model for each market interval. Based on the customer load and excess PV energy, the CDA market is cleared using a bid/ask matching mechanism. The performance of the P2P market was evaluated by computing different welfare metrics while analysing the effect of network constraints. The results show that the designed CDA-based P2P market structure increases the social welfare of all participants by an average of 17.75% compared to the baseline for the presented cases. Moreover, the impact of the forecasting error between the day-ahead and real-time market was also quantified.","Institution of Engineering and Technology (IET)","","Idaho National Lab.

The top layer of the proposed architecture consists of the designed automatic voltage regulation (AVR) application, which has access to voltage measurements and grid parameters from the LV distribution grid, both current and historical. The AVR application solves a constrained optimization problem, which provides a set of local control set-points that bring the voltage across the grid within bounds. The middle layer consists of a local Volt/VAR controller, which is adjusted by the AVR app, while the bottom layer is the inner-loop controller of the PV inverter. The proposed method not only improves the voltage quality in the grid but also manages the reactive power outputs of PV inverters efficiently. Further, a digital twin of the cyber-physical system has also been employed that interacts with the control system to ensure its appropriate operation. The effectiveness of the proposed methodology is demonstrated on a representative low-voltage feeder located in Denmark.","Elsevier","","Oak Ridge National Lab.

"UAS Edge Computing of Energy Infrastructure Damage Assessment","","24 POWER TRANSMISSION AND DISTRIBUTION","Energy infrastructure assessments are needed within 72 hours of natural disasters, and previous data collection methods have proven too slow. We demonstrate a scalable end-to-end solution using a prototype unmanned aerial system that performs on-the-edge detection, classification (i.e., damaged or undamaged), and geo-location of utility poles. The prototype is suitable for disaster response because it requires no local communication infrastructure and is capable of autonomous missions. Collections before, during, and after Hurricane Ida in 2021 were used to test the system. The system delivered an F1 score of 0.65 operating with a 2.7 s/frame processing speed with the YOLOv5 large model and an F1 score of 0.55 with a 0.48 s/frame with the YOLOv5 small model. Geo-location uncertainty in the bottom half of the frame was ~8 m, mostly driven by error in camera pointing measurement. With additional training data to improve performance and detect additional types of features, a fleet of similar drones could autonomously collect actionable post-disaster data.","Ingenta","","Oak Ridge National Lab.

"Experimental performance of ejector heat pump operating in the sub-critical mode","Spitzenberger, Jeremy; Mohammed, Ramy H.; Ismael, Laith; Wang, Pengtao; Ma, Hongbin; Abu-Heiba, Ahmad; Kowalski, Stephen; Nawaz, Kashif","24 POWER TRANSMISSION AND DISTRIBUTION; steam ejector; heat pump; COP; sub-critical conditions; water heating","Ejector heat pump (EHP) is an efficient-energy technology with a promising potential to replace the vapor compression cycle in heating and cooling applications. It can be powered by low-grade waste heat and uses environmentally friendly working fluids. EHP has also become a viable solution in research seeking cooling applications. However, little attention has been paid to using EHP for heating purposes. In order to investigate this, a steam EHP for domestic water heating was designed and built. The coefficient of performance (COP) is evaluated at various operating and design conditions in sub-critical operational modes to achieve higher condensation temperatures. Two primary nozzles with a throat diameter of 1.5 mm and 2.0 mm were investigated. The primary nozzle is movable along the ejector’s axis, allowing investigation of its positional effects on the EHP’s COP. Further, experimental measurements revealed that using a smaller throat diameter results in a high COP and low back pressure. The EHP COP and back pressure increase when the LTE temperature increases. Using a throat diameter of 1.5 mm, the EHP COP increases as the nozzle exit position (NXP) becomes closer to the constant area section. A COP of 2.42 and a back pressure of 4.28 kPa are achieved at a high-temperature evaporator (HTE) temperature of 130 °C and a low-temperature evaporator (LTE) temperature of 30 °C using a primary nozzle with 1.5 mm.","Elsevier","","Oak Ridge National Lab.

"Spatial-Temporal Deep Learning for Hosting Capacity Analysis in Distribution Grids","Wu, Jiaqi; Yuan, Jingyi; Weng, Yang; Ayyanar, Raja","14 SOLAR ENERGY; 24 POWER TRANSMISSION AND DISTRIBUTION; Hosting capacity; deep learning; data-driven method; long short-term memory (LSTM); spatial-temporal correlation; distributed energy resource","The widespread use of distributed energy sources (DERs) raises significant challenges for power system design, planning, and operation, leading to wide adaptation of tools on hosting capacity analysis (HCA). Traditional HCA methods conduct extensive power flow analysis. Due to the computation burden, these time-consuming methods fail to provide online hosting capacity (HC) in large distribution systems. To solve the problem, we first propose a deep learning-based problem formulation for HCA, which conducts offline training and determines HC in real time. The used learning model, long short-term memory (LSTM), implements historical time-series data to capture periodical patterns in distribution systems. However, directly applying LSTMs suffers from low accuracy due to the lack of consideration on spatial information, where location information like feeder topology is critical in nodal HCA. Therefore, we modify the forget gate function to dual forget gates, to capture the spatial correlation within the grid. Such a design turns the LSTM into the Spatial-Temporal LSTM (ST-LSTM). Moreover, as voltage violations are the most vital constraints in HCA, we design a voltage sensitivity gate to increase accuracy further. The results of LSTMs and ST-LSTMs on feeders, such as IEEE 34-, 123-bus feeders, and utility feeders, validate our designs.","Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers","","Arizona State Univ., Tempe, AZ (United States)","USDOE Office of Energy Efficiency and Renewable Energy (EERE), Renewable Power Office.

These events highlight the need to develop approaches to assess the resilience of power systems against extreme events; however, the availability of data that capture power system performance during and after disruptive events is scarce. This paper proposes an assessment framework to evaluate the performance aspects of the power grid during extreme outage events using the Environment for Analysis of Geo-Located Energy Information (EAGLE-I) data. EAGLE-I data include information related to the number of impacted customers, the duration, and the location of power outages in the United States. Statistical analyses were conducted to extract resilience-based outage data and derive probability distribution functions of their impact and recovery characteristics. A list of extreme events is identified based on population-based threshold values. Metrics from other power outage assessments were used to measure the characteristics of each event, including the impact rate and duration, the recovery rate and duration, and the impact level. A probability distribution function is obtained for each metric. The proposed framework is conducted for each state across the United States. The obtained results provide a probabilistic representation of state-level outage behaviors, which can be applied as a framework to evaluate various resilience enhancement techniques.","Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers","","National Renewable Energy Lab.

The charging load of heavy-duty charging station can reach several megawatts, which could induce adverse impacts on the distribution grid if not effectively mitigated. To analyze the impacts and provide corresponding solutions, we select four representative distribution systems - including both single-feeder cases and a multi-feeder case - and design thorough test metrics for the impact analysis. The charging load profiles used in the analysis are derived from realistic conventional heavy-duty vehicle travel data. Based on the analysis results, charging stations are placed at three different representative locations in each distribution system: best, good, and worst locations. Mitigation strategies using a combination of smart charger functionality, on-site photovoltaic (PV) generation, and on-site energy storage (ES) are proposed and tested. A sizing method is also proposed to find the optimal PV-ES-charger capacity that minimizes the capital cost.","Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers","","National Renewable Energy Lab.

Here for example, the U.S. government has set a goal of reaching 100 percent carbon pollution-free electricity by 2035, while the Department of Energy (DOE) shared a goal to deploy 30 GW and 110 GW of offshore wind by 2030 and 2050, respectively. To meet such ambitious goals, in the years to come, a significant percentage of electricity will come from intermittent renewable sources, electric vehicles (EVs), and be supplied to a vast number of loads that will actively respond to grid conditions and incentive signals. This development is largely driven by environmental and economic factors, such as reducing carbon emissions and saving electricity cost for consumers. These energy resources lead to new uncertain behaviors and dynamics which the grid has never seen and were not considered in its design.

"Editorial: Edge computation and digital distribution networks","Li, Peng; Peng, Yonggang; Ji, Haoran; Ding, Fei; Xi, Wei","24 POWER TRANSMISSION AND DISTRIBUTION; digital distribution networks; edge computation; operation control; simulation","The development of digital technologies is penetrating all areas of energy revolution. Based on the in-depth integration of advanced digital technologies, distribution networks are gradually transforming into digital distribution networks (DDNs) with tremendous changes from the structure to the operation mode. DDNs is the digitalized appearance of the physical distribution network, in which ubiquitous connections and massive data are the basic characteristics (Huo et al., 2022). It is an important task to utilize the massive data and propose novel operation modes to construct more efficient and intelligent distribution networks (Jian et al., 2022). Among the advanced digital technologies in DDNs, edge computing has received wide attention (Zhao et al., 2022). It has superior performance in local sensing and intelligent computation, which can effectively relieve huge communication pressure. However, the limited computing resources and the complex computing tasks at the edge side significantly challenge the collaboration of distribution network regulation and advanced digital technologies (Hu et al., 2022). It is necessary to find out proper methods to utilize advanced digital technology to construct DDNs. This Research Topic is organized to introduce the recent progress in the construction, operation and advanced computational methods for DDNs.

"Reevaluating Contour Visualizations for Power Systems Data","Gruchalla, Kenny; Molnar, Samantha; Johnson, Graham","24 POWER TRANSMISSION AND DISTRIBUTION; heat map; human factors; power systems; visualization","Effective visual analytics tools are needed now more than ever as emerging energy systems data and models are rapidly growing in scale and complexity. Here we examined the suitability of colored contour maps to visually represent bus values in two different power system models: a dense 24k-bus distribution system and a 240-bus transmission system. In a quantitative analysis, we found that contour maps misrepresent power systems data, changing the statistical dispersion of the bus values, including the loss of extreme values. In a controlled empirical study with thirty professional power system research engineers, we found that these distortions significantly impact excursion identification tasks. Additionally, the engineers were less confident in their assessments using contour-based visualizations than glyph-based visualizations.","IEEE","","National Renewable Energy Lab.

"Quantitative Metrics for Grid Resilience Evaluation and Optimization","Yao, Yiyun; Liu, Weijia; Jain, Rishabh; Chowdhury, Badrul; Wang, Jianhui; Cox, Robert","24 POWER TRANSMISSION AND DISTRIBUTION; community microgrid; distributed energy resource; power system optimization; power system resilience; resilience quantification","Power system resilience has become a critical topic in recent years because of the increasing trend of extreme events and the growing integration of intermittent renewable energy sources. To enhance grid resilience against high-impact, low-frequency events, two questions should be answered: how to quantify the resilience of a given grid and how to incorporate the quantification into power system planning, operation, and restoration. Here this paper develops a new set of quantitative metrics with clear physical interpretation to comprehensively evaluate power system resilience. Using microgrids as an example, an event-based corrective scheduling (ECS) model and an online model predictive control (OMPC) model are developed to integrate the proposed quantitative resilience metrics into power system optimization models for resilience enhancement. The ECS model employs extreme event data to investigate the optimal restoration solution and to help microgrid operators prepare to respond to similar events. The OMPC model provides online decision-making support for operators to handle ongoing outages in the most resilient fashion. The effectiveness and superiority of the proposed quantitative resilience metrics and the resilience enhancement models are demonstrated through simulations and comparative studies on an IEEE test feeder and a real distribution feeder in Southern California.","IEEE","","National Renewable Energy Lab.

"Derivation and assessment of regional electricity generation emission factors in the USA","Ghosh, Tapajyoti; Ingwersen, Wesley W.; Jamieson, Matthew; Hawkins, Troy R.; Cashman, Sarah; Hottle, Troy; Carpenter, Alberta; Richa, Kirti","29 ENERGY PLANNING, POLICY, AND ECONOMY; 24 POWER TRANSMISSION AND DISTRIBUTION; electricity grid; emission factor; life cycle inventory","Electricity production is one of the largest sources of environmental emissions - especially greenhouse gases (GHGs) - in the USA. Emission factors (EFs) vary from region to region, which requires the use of spatially relevant EF data for electricity production while performing life cycle assessments (LCAs). Uncertainty information, which is sought by LCA practitioners, is rarely supplied with available life cycle inventories (LCIs). To address these challenges, we present a method for collecting data from different sources for electricity generation and environmental emissions; discuss the challenges involved in agglomerating such data; provide relevant suggestions and solutions to merge the information; and calculate EFs for electricity generation processes from various fuel sources for different spatial regions and spatial resolutions. The EFs from the US 2016 Electricity Life Cycle Inventory (eLCI) are analyzed and explored in this study. We also explore the method of uncertainty information derivation for the EFs. We explore the EFs from different technologies across Emissions & Generation Resource Integrated Database (eGRID) regions in the USA. We find that for certain eGRID regions, the same electricity production technology may have worse emissions. This may be a result of the age of the plants in the region, the quality of fuel used, or other underlying factors. Region-wise life cycle impact assessment (LCIA) ISO 14040 impacts for total generation mix activities provide an overview of the total sustainability profile of electricity production in a particular region, rather than only global warming potential (GWP). We also find that, for different LCIA impacts, several eGRID regions are consistently worse than the US average LCIA impact for every unit of electricity generated. Here this work describes the development of an electricity production LCI at different spatial resolutions by combining and harmonizing information from several databases. The inventory consists of emissions, fuel inputs, and electricity and steam outputs from different electricity production technologies located across various regions of the USA. This LCI for electricity production in the USA will prove to be an enormous resource for all LCA researchers - considering the detailed sources of the information and the breadth of emissions covered by it.","Springer","","National Renewable Energy Lab.

"Incorporate day-ahead robustness and real-time incentives for electricity market design","Guo, Yi; Han, Xuejiao; Zhou, Xinyang; Hug, Gabriela","24 POWER TRANSMISSION AND DISTRIBUTION; distribution networks; electricity market mechanism; online optimization; power systems; stochastic optimization","In this paper, we propose a two-stage electricity market framework to explore the participation of distributed energy resources (DERs) in a day-ahead (DA) market and a real-time (RT) market. The objective is to determine the optimal bidding strategies of the aggregated DERs in the DA market and generate online incentive signals for DER-owners to optimize the social-welfare taking into account network operational constraints. Distributionally robust optimization is used to explicitly incorporate data-based statistical information of renewable forecasts into the supply/demand decisions in the DA market. We evaluate the conservativeness of bidding strategies distinguished by different risk aversion settings. In the RT market, a bi-level time-varying optimization problem is proposed to design the online incentive signals to tradeoff the RT imbalance penalty for distribution system operators (DSOs) and the costs of individual DER-owners. This enables tracking their optimal dispatch to provide fast balancing services, in the presence of time-varying network states while satisfying the voltage regulation requirement. Simulation results on both DA wholesale market and RT balancing market demonstrate the necessity of this two-stage design, and its robustness to uncertainties, the performance of convergence, the tracking ability and the feasibility of the resulting network operations.","Elsevier","","National Renewable Energy Lab.

Our solution relaxes several existing assumptions in the literature and is able to navigate trade-offs between peak power requirements and maximum frequency deviations.

Long-duration outages caused by such high impact events propagate to economic, health, and social consequences for communities. As essential service providers, electric utilities are mandated to provide safe, economical and reliable electricity to their customers. The public is becoming less tolerant to these more frequent disruptions, especially in view of technological advances that are intended to improve power quality, reliability and resilience. One promising solution is state-of-the-art microgrids and the advanced controls employed therein.

AFM was originally formulated as a distributed optimization problem. Here, federated learning is used to train each microgrid's network with training data achieved from distributed optimization. The main contribution of this work is to replace the optimization-based AFM control algorithm with a learning-based AFM control algorithm. The replacement transfers computation from online to offline. With this replacement, the control algorithm can meet real-time requirements for a system with dozens of microgrids. By contrast, distributed-optimization-based fault management can output reference values fast enough for a system with several microgrids. More microgrids, however, lead to more computation time with optimization-based method. Distributed-optimization-based fault management would fail real-time requirements for a system with dozens of microgrids.

"Fast Quasi-Static Time-Series Simulation for Accurate PV Inverter Semiconductor Fatigue Analysis with a Long-Term Solar Profile","Liu, Yunting; Tolbert, Leon M.; Kritprajun, Paychuda; Dong, Jiaojiao; Zhu, Lin; Ollis, Thomas Ben; Schneider, Kevin P.; Prabakar, Kumaraguru","24 POWER TRANSMISSION AND DISTRIBUTION; 14 SOLAR ENERGY; aging; fatigue; inverters; solar power generation; systems simulation","Power system simulations with long-term data typically have large time steps, varying from one second to a few minutes. However, for PV inverter semiconductors in grid-connected applications, the minimum thermal stress cycle occurs over the fundamental grid frequency (50 or 60 Hz). This requires the time step of the fatigue simulation to be approximately 100 μs. This small time step requires long computation times to process yearly power production profiles. In this paper, we propose a fast fatigue simulation for inverter semiconductors using the quasi-static time-series simulation concept. The proposed simulation calculates the steady state of the semiconductor junction temperature using a fast Fourier transform. The small thermal cycling during a switching period and even over the fundamental waveform is disregarded to further accelerate the simulation speed. The resulting time step of the fatigue simulation is 15 min, which is consistent with the solar dataset. The error of the proposed simulation is 0.16% compared to the fatigue simulation results using the complete thermal stress profile. The error of the proposed method is significantly less than the conventional averaged thermal profile. A PV inverter that responds to a transactive energy system is simulated to demonstrate the use of the proposed fatigue simulation. The proposed simulation has the potential to cosimulate with system-level simulation tools that also adopt the quasi-static time-series concept.","MDPI","","National Renewable Energy Lab.

Market pricing is an instrumental mechanism for the distribution system operator to exploit the full potential of the flexible resources. The distribution locational marginal price (DLMP) can be used to guide the residential load consumption. This type of market signal helps the distribution system operator to optimize the scheduling of all resources while satisfying related network constraints through a day-ahead market. However, solving the optimization problem for large-scale systems can be computationally expensive. To address the scalability and practicability limitations of the DLMP framework, a learning-based approach is proposed in this paper to complement the day-ahead distribution market framework. Here, the proposed approach combines long short-term memory and transfer learning to develop deep neural network that can capture the spatial–temporal correlation of the input data. The model can determine the optimal DLMP for each node in a distribution system without the system parameters required to formulate the optimization problem. Testing results on IEEE 33-bus and 123-bus systems show that the proposed approach can generate a comparable DLMP against the optimization solutions.","Elsevier","","Oak Ridge National Lab.

To improve the accuracy of the approximation results, the proposed method integrates the K-means clustering technique with PCM to select the approximation samples of input variables.

The electricity generation sector has embarked on an ambitious plan to include renewable generation as part of its decarbonization efforts, and many cities and states are mandating all-electric buildings. While renewable resources will reduce emissions, they are not dispatchable, they vary temporally, and their generation is uncertain. Under these conditions, traditional approaches to managing grid reliability, where supply follows demand, will not be efficient and may not be cost-effective. Further, there is a more efficient alternative for balancing the supply–demand imbalance and for absorbing variability and uncertainty of renewable energy using distributed energy resources (DERs) as opposed to reserve generation. Because buildings consume more than 75% of total U.S. annual electricity consumption, behind-the-meter (BTM) DERs have a load flexibility of 77 GW of power and 90 GWh of virtual energy storage capacity nationwide (Kalsi, 2017). Therefore, some portion of the supply–demand imbalance can be met by these DERs at a lower cost compared to business-as-usual solutions.","IEEE Xplore","","Pacific Northwest National Lab.

In this paper, we consider an architecture consisting of dc-ac modules containing a quadruple active bridge dc-dc converter, which generates three floating dc links that feed grid-side dc-ac inverters. Practical implementation of such a converter module in PV systems requires a variety of controllers that collectively achieve maximum power point tracking, dc-link regulation, and ac-side power control. Design of such multi-loop systems is generally quite challenging due to the potential for destabilizing interactions among loops. Here we propose a design approach where singular perturbation theory is used to decompose the timescales at which each control loop operates and provides a systematic framework for parametric selection. Our approach also ensures system stability of multiple modules with identical controls connected in series across a grid. The paper concludes with experimental results of three 1000 W series-connected converter modules across a stiff grid.","IEEE","","National Renewable Energy Lab.

Here, this research aims to demonstrate and analyze the effect of plant-level voltage control on system stability and potential interactions among IBRs. The experiment results of a 13.2-kV system interconnected with two IBRs—a 1-MW battery energy storage system (BESS) and a 430-kW solar photovoltaic (PV) plant—are presented. Both 0.5-Hz and 3-Hz oscillations become visible at certain conditions. The phenomenon is further explained by use of a feedback system consisting of the plant-level droop control and the effect of reactive power or var injection on voltage. The main components of the block diagram are obtained via frequency scan measurements. The analysis offers an understanding of the main contributors and other influencing factors of the 3-Hz and 0.5-Hz modes. It also reveals the role of the volt-var droop gain, the low-pass filter time constant, and the system impedance in stability.","IEEE","","National Renewable Energy Lab.

Therefore, smart grid systems require sophisticated supporting structures. Furthermore, rapid detection and identification of disturbances and transients are a necessary first step towards situationally aware smart grid systems. This way, high-level monitoring is achieved and the entire system kept operational. Even though smart grid systems are unavoidably sophisticated, low-complexity algorithms need to be developed for real-time sensing on the edge and online applications to alert stakeholders in the event of an anomaly. In this study, the simplest form of anomaly detection mechanism in the absence of any a priori knowledge, namely, the energy detector (also known as radiometer in the field of wireless communications and signal processing), is investigated as a triggering mechanism, which may include automated alerts and notifications for grid anomalies. In contrast to the mainstream literature, it does not rely on transform domain tools; therefore, utmost design and implementation simplicity are attained. Performance results of the proposed energy detector algorithm are validated by real power system data obtained from the DOE/EPRI National Database of power system events and the Grid Signature Library.","MDPI","","Oak Ridge National Lab.

Metrics are an emerging area of importance for the operationalization of energy equity as they may guide stakeholders’ investment and policy decisions along this transition. This paper aims to advance energy equity metrics for use in regulation, planning, and operations of the electricity system within the United States. Metrics were surveyed from the literature and distilled to a set that furthermore identifies which stakeholders may be associated with which metrics. Established tenets of energy justice—distributive, procedural, recognition, restorative—were also identified for each metric, providing a link between energy equity in study and in practice. This means of organization is intended to enable discussion and collaboration among stakeholders, as the objectives embodied in energy equity metrics are often beyond the control of single stakeholders. Further stakeholder discussion is necessary to determine which metrics are practicable, who will use them, and how they will be used to support energy equity.","Elsevier","","Pacific Northwest National Lab.

To utilize such flexibility, a tri-level distribution market framework is established, including residential consumers, load aggregators (LAs), and the distribution system operator (DSO). In this work, the uncertainties from all three levels are considered. The random consumption behavior at the consumer level is modeled as a Gaussian noise that is also aggregated and transmitted to the LA level. The weather temperature in the LA level is forecasted as an interval, and the photovoltaic (PV) power in the market-clearing level is modeled by a set of power scenarios generated by Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs). Then, a hybrid interval-stochastic programming is proposed to transform the uncertain problems in the first two levels into deterministic ones. For real-time implementations, a rolling horizon optimization (RHO) scheme is employed to continuously optimize the power consumption based on the latest operating information. Finally, case studies on a modified IEEE 69-bus system validate the effectiveness of the proposed uncertainty modeling strategies and the RHO scheme.","Elsevier","","Oak Ridge National Lab.

"Impact of Electric Vehicle customer response to Time-of-Use rates on distribution power grids","Birk Jones, C.; Vining, William; Lave, Matthew; Haines, Thad; Neuman, Christopher; Bennett, Jesse; Scoffield, Don R.","33 ADVANCED PROPULSION SYSTEMS; 24 POWER TRANSMISSION AND DISTRIBUTION; caldera; electric vehicles; EVI-Pro; grid; OpenDSS; time-of-use","Electric Vehicles (EV) present a unique challenge to electric power system (EPS) operations because of the potential magnitude and timing of load increases due to EV charging. Time-of-Use (TOU) electricity pricing is an established way to reduce peak system loads. It is effective at shifting the timing of some customer-activated residential loads - such as dishwashers, washing machines, or HVAC systems - to off-peak periods. EV charging, though, can be larger than typical residential loads (up to 19.2 kW) and may have on-board controls that automatically begin charging according to a pre-set schedule, such as when off-peak periods begin. To understand and quantify the potential impact of EV charging's response to TOU pricing, this paper simulates 10 distribution feeders with predicted 2030 EV adoption levels. The simulation results show that distribution EPS experience an increase in peak demand as high as 20% when a majority of the charging begins immediately after on-peak times end, as might occur if EV charging is automatically scheduled. However, if charging start times are randomized within the off-peak period, EV charging is spread out and the simulations showed a decrease in the peak load to be 5% lower than results from simulations that did not implement TOU rates.","Elsevier","","National Renewable Energy Lab.

"A New Type of Weak Grid IBR Oscillations","Fan, Lingling; Miao, Zhixin; Wang, Zhengyu","24 POWER TRANSMISSION AND DISTRIBUTION; inverter-based resources; oscillations; weak grid","This letter presents the discovery of a new type oscillations associated with inverter-based resources (IBRs) in weak grids. While typical weak grid oscillations become worse when the grid strength decreases and the power exporting level increases, this new type of oscillations appear when the grid becomes weaker and the power exporting level decreases. Electromagnetic transient (EMT) simulation results are presented, along with eigenvalue loci for a varying power. The notable signatures of such oscillations are also remarked. In further analysis, a feedback system consisting of two blocks is derived with one block associated with the phase-locked-loop (PLL) and the other associated with the rest of the system. Here, this feedback system quantitatively demonstrates why insufficient damping in the PLL may be an issue for stability. Open-loop analysis shows that a larger phase lag in angle tracking in the low-frequency range due to high power exporting level at the weak grid condition is beneficial to the open-loop poles introduced by the PLL. And this is the reason why such oscillations may appear when power is ramping down.","IEEE","","Univ. of South Florida, Tampa, FL (United States)","USDOE","","United States","2022-11-07T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: IEEE Transactions on Power Systems; Journal Volume: 38; Journal Issue: 1","","Medium: ED; Size: p. 988 - 991","","","EE0008771","Journal ID: ISSN 0885-8950","10.1109/tpwrs.2022.3220050","","2023-02-27T00:00:00Z","1897734","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/1897734","","IEEE Transactions on Power Systems","1","38"

Within this work, we explore the use of continuous-time echo state networks as a means to cheaply, and accurately, predict the dynamic response of power systems subject to a disturbance for varying system parameters. We show an application for predicting frequency dynamics following a loss of generation for varying penetrations of grid-following and grid-forming converters. We demonstrate that, after training on 20 solutions of the full-order system, we achieve a median nadir prediction error of 0.17 mHz with 95% of all nadir prediction errors within ±4 mHz. We conclude with some discussion on how this approach can be used for parameter sensitivity analysis and within optimization algorithms to rapidly predict the dynamical behavior of the system.","Elsevier","","National Renewable Energy Lab.

There are five general approaches by which system operators and market participants can use probabilistic forecasts of wind, solar, and load to help manage this uncertainty. These include operator situation awareness, resource risk hedging, reserves procurement, definition of contingencies, and explicit stochastic optimization. We review these approaches, and then provide a case study in which a method for using probabilistic solar forecasts to define needs for reserves is developed and evaluated. The case study has three parts. First, we describe building blocks for enhancing the Watt-Sun solar forecasting system to produce probabilistic irradiance and power forecasts. Second, relationships between Watt-Sun forecasts for multiple sites in California and the system's need for flexible ramp capability (flexiramp) are defined by machine learning and statistical methods. Third, the performance of present methods to defining flexiramp requirements, which are not conditioned on weather and renewables forecasts, is compared with that of probabilistic solar forecast-based requirements, using a multi-timescale production costing model with an 1820-bus representation of the WECC power system. Significant potential savings in fuel and flexiramp procurement costs from using solar-informed reserve requirements are found.","IEEE","","National Renewable Energy Lab.

Lack of available data points and the unbalanced nature of the distribution system make fault handling a challenging task for utilities. The proposed method uses event-driven voltage data from smart meters to classify and locate faults. The ensemble voting classifier is composed of three base learners; random forest, k-nearest neighbours, and artificial neural network. The fault location (FL) task has been formulated as a classification problem where the fault type is classified in the first step and based on the fault type, the faulty bus is identified. The method is tested on IEEE-123 bus system modified with added PV-based microgrid along with dynamic loading conditions and varying fault resistances from 0 to 20 Ω for both unbalanced and balanced fault types. A further sensitivity analysis has been done to test the robustness of the proposed method under various noise levels and data loss errors in the smart meter measurements. The ensemble method shows improved performance and robustness compared to some previously proposed FL methods. Finally, the proposed method has been experimentally validated on a real-time simulation-based testbed using a state-of-the-art digital real-time simulator, industry standard DNP3 communication protocol and a cpu-based control centre running the FL algorithm.","Institution of Engineering and Technology (IET)","","Idaho National Lab.

"The Energy Transition: Advanced Nuclear Needed but Address Climate Vulnerabilities Now","Bochman, Andrew A","24 - POWER TRANSMISSION AND DISTRIBUTION; Energy; Energy Transition; Energy Grids; Climate Change; Critical Infrastructure","The term “Energy Transition” is an attempt to capture an elaborate set of activities related to the modernization and decarbonization of energy grids. Performed concurrently and often in an ad hoc manner across local, state, regional and national boundaries, it is bringing chaos to what should arguably be one of the most conservatively managed of all critical infrastructure sectors. What’s more, with climate change producing an increasing tempo of extreme events, confidence in the intended resilient and redundant structure of the electric grids is likely to ebb. Even without these climate induced stressors, the nation’s electric grid was built for an earlier century. In addition to a drive towards greater efficiency via digitization and a continuing price decline in distributed energy resources (DERs), one could argue that climate change concerns are the primary driver of the energy transition. Non-CO2 emitting generation sources like wind and solar have become an important part of the overall generation fleet, albeit ones that cannot be counted upon to provide dispatchable power. Current projections indicate deployment of even larger percentages of DERs in coming years. Until far better storage capabilities arrive, the variability of wind and solar, inconsistent performance of traditional thermal generation plants, and energy delivery failures associated with natural gas pipelines will reinforce mounting reliability concerns. This pertains to both electric transmission and distribution. The recent shuttering of nuclear power plants in Germany, Japan, the US and elsewhere are also putting more downward pressure on dispatchable generation. Russia’s attack on Ukraine has roiled energy markets worldwide and forced some countries to return to coal as a primary fuel. In view circumstances such as these, it is essential that significant changes be made to policies and planning criteria, and to the standards and code on which they are based. Given the accelerating pace of extreme weather events, this needs to occur as soon as possible.","","","Idaho National Lab.

Power system operators attempting to restore critical facilities faced challenges on almost every front from interruptions to necessary supply chains to the inaccessibility of key assets. After a disaster of this magnitude, it is critical, but challenging, to prioritize how limited resources are directed toward rebuilding and fortifying the electric power system. To inform these decisions, the U.S. Department of Energy funded efforts investigating methodologies to identify critical vulnerabilities to the Puerto Rican power system and to provide data-driven recommendations on how to harden and operate the system for greater resilience. This work presents the Risk-based Contingency Analysis Tool (RCAT), a framework developed as a part of that resilience initiative. The framework can qualitatively and quantitatively describe the most critical system vulnerabilities with an understanding of both likelihood of occurrence and impact. It evaluates the effectiveness of candidate remediation strategies in reducing overall risk to the system from future hurricane events. This paper will describe RCAT, with an emphasis on how different modeling capabilities have been integrated and the introduction of probabilistic methods and analytical metrics to better describe risk.","Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers","","Pacific Northwest National Lab.

A method is developed to prepare tensile specimens of laminated MANC and epoxy layers, simulating the stacking of an epoxy-impregnated tape-wound core. Tensile tests are conducted for single layer ribbon and for five- and ten-layer stacks of laminated material with thin layers of thermosetting epoxy. Failure distributions are shown to have increasing Weibull modulus with increasing layer count. The composite MANC material system is modeled using chain-of-bundles models. Using a k-failure model, we show that single ribbon strength distribution data can be used to predict well the failure distribution of laminated stacks. The agreement occurs when the assumed ineffective length, over which load is recovered in a failed layer, is comparable to the observed interlaminar separation length.</p>","","","Carnegie Mellon Univ., Pittsburgh, PA (United States)","USDOE Vehicle Technologies Office; USDOE Advanced Manufacturing Office; USDOE","","United States","2023-01-01T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: Journal of Composite Materials","","Medium: ED; Size: 002199832311599","","","EE0007867; EE0008870","Journal ID: ISSN 0021--9983","10.1177/00219983231159956","","2023-03-08T00:00:00Z","1924681","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/1924681","","Journal of Composite Materials","",""

A testbed of a BPS constructed in PSCAD, with both grid-forming inverter (GFM)-based IBRs and grid-following inverter (GFL)-based IBRs, is utilized for simulation. For linear analysis, a data-driven method is used to obtain the dq admittance models of the IBRs. This information, combined with our knowledge of the network admittance, leads to eigenvalue analysis of the power grid. Furthermore, for the dominant 3-Hz mode, extended frequency-domain mode shape analysis, along with subgroup effect analysis, and network decomposition analysis are conducted. The analysis results can precisely tell the influencing factors of the oscillation mode. This mode is identified as an interarea oscillation mode. It has a different characteristics compared to the traditional electromechanical interarea mode. Specifically, the network decomposition analysis provides new insights on interarea oscillation modes. The analysis results are all confirmed by the electromagnetic transient (EMT) simulation results.","Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers","","National Renewable Energy Lab.

Prior state of the art has established convergence to the consensus value; however, the asymptotic convergence of these algorithms poses a challenge in practical settings where the response from agents is required in finite time. To this end, we propose a maximum-minimum protocol that propagates the global maximum and minimum values of agent states (while running the consensus algorithm) in the network. This article focuses on establishing that the global maximum and minimum values are strictly monotonic even for a dynamic topology, and they can be used to distributively ascertain the closeness to convergence in finite time. We rigorously show that each node can have access to the global maximum and minimum by running the proposed maximum-minimum protocol to realize a finite-time stopping criterion for the otherwise asymptotic consensus algorithm. The practical utility of the algorithm is illustrated through experiments where each agent is instantiated by a NodeJS socket.io server.","","","National Renewable Energy Lab.

Agami","24 POWER TRANSMISSION AND DISTRIBUTION; Social vulnerability; Power networks; Grid hardening","The increasing occurrence of extreme weather events urges us to reevaluate the resiliency and vulnerability aspects of our most critical infrastructures — such as power grids — as their failures result in both economic loss and severe human hardship. Seen through the lens of alleviating human suffering, it is crucial to be able to identify critical system components of the infrastructure for targeted hardening given resource constraints. This effort is of particular importance in islanded areas such as Puerto Rico where hurricanes are frequent and resources are limited, and where the spatially diverse effects of power loss on human suffering are all the more severe. Recent studies on evaluating infrastructure networks during extreme weather events have taken a simulation based approach that incorporates a variety of component models, such as weather realizations, topological network models, fragility models, and power flow models to estimate expected loss of service. Here, in this work, we expand such a Component Based Event Simulation (CBES) methodology proposed in the literature and integrate it with a social vulnerability modeling component. This paradigm-advancing approach of synthesizing the cutting edge capability of power network modeling and the social impacts of the power transmission network failure is demonstrated for the island of Puerto Rico. Our work exemplifies the efficacy of this integrated modeling framework in developing a decision metric for targeted transmission line hardening.","Elsevier","","Oak Ridge National Lab.

MV multiport SSTs are promising in integrating low-voltage DC sources or loads such as solar photovoltaic, energy storage, and electric vehicles into smart grids without bulky line-frequency transformers. Compared to voltage-source SST, current-source (CS) SST features single-stage isolated bidirectional AC/AC, AC/DC, or DC/DC conversion using an inductive DC link. For a multiport CS SST, it is revealed in this article that the PPP capability can be enabled through the proposed control without extra hardware, different from the case of voltage-source converters where special hardware architecture is required for the PPP. With the PPP, most power exchange between LV ports is processed by only a fraction of the entire conversion stage, leading to reduced DC-link current, volume, loss, and improved efficiency. The proposed multiport PPP control scheme is analyzed to verify the advantages across a wide voltage and power range against conventional full power processing (FPP) multiport control, using the soft-switching solid-state transformer (S4T) with reduced conduction loss as an example. Comparative experimental results based on a SiC three-port S4T prototype verify the effectiveness of the proposed PPP scheme against the FPP scheme under both steady state and dynamic conditions. Here, the DC-link current reduction is measured to be more than 36%. Significantly, the proposed multiport PPP control scheme is generic and applicable to any hard-switching or soft-switching CS SSTs without extra hardware.","IEEE","","Georgia Institute of Technology, Atlanta, GA (United States)","USDOE Advanced Research Projects Agency - Energy (ARPA-E)","","United States","2022-09-30T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: IEEE Transactions on Power Electronics; Journal Volume: 38; Journal Issue: 2","","Medium: ED; Size: p. 2606-2616","","","AR0000899","Journal ID: ISSN 0885-8993","10.1109/tpel.2022.3211000","","2023-03-27T00:00:00Z","1892471","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/1892471","","IEEE Transactions on Power Electronics","2","38"

In lieu of a batch linear least-squares (LS) approach well-suited for static networks, where a sufficient number of measurements could be collected to obtain a full-rank design matrix the paper proposes an online algorithm to estimate the possibly time-varying state by processing measurements as and when available. The design of the algorithm hinges on a generalized LS cost augmented with a proximal-point-type regularization. With the solution of the regularized LS problem available in closed-form, the online algorithm is written as a linear dynamical system where the state is updated based on the previous estimate and based on the new available measurements. Conditions under which the algorithmic steps are in fact a contractive mapping are shown, and bounds on the estimation error are derived for different noise models. Numerical simulations are provided to corroborate the analytical findings.","IEEE","","National Renewable Energy Lab.

(ORCID:0000000190164268); Tomsovic, Kevin","24 POWER TRANSMISSION AND DISTRIBUTION; distributed optimization; energy management; networked microgrids, mixed integer linear programming (MILP); distributed energy resources","<p>An MILP-based distributed energy management for the coordination of networked microgrids is proposed in this paper. Multiple microgrids and the utility grid are coordinated through iteratively adjusted price signals. Based on the price signals received, the microgrid controllers (MCs) and distribution management system (DMS) update their schedules separately. Then, the price signals are updated according to the generation–load mismatch and distributed to MCs and DMS for the next iteration. The iteration continues until the generation–load mismatch is small enough, i.e., the generation and load are balanced under agreed price signals. Through the proposed distributed energy management, various microgrids and the utility grid with different economic, resilient, emission and socio-economic objectives are coordinated with generation–load balance guaranteed and the microgrid customers’ privacy preserved. In particular, a piecewise linearization technique is employed to approximate the augmented Lagrange term in the alternating direction method of multipliers (ADMM) algorithm. Thus, the subproblems are transformed into mixed integer linear programming (MILP) problems and efficiently solved by open-source MILP solvers, which would accelerate the adoption and deployment of microgrids and promote clean energy. The proposed MILP-based distributed energy management is demonstrated through various case studies on a networked microgrids test system with three microgrids.</p>","MDPI AG","","Oak Ridge National Lab.

This letter reveals why such oscillations occur in the individual var measurement, while being insignificant in the total var measurement, regardless of the varying grid impedance. We adopt two analysis approaches: open-loop single-input single-output analysis and network decomposition. The two approaches differ in their treatment of turbine-network interaction. The open-loop analysis shows that the turbine-turbine oscillation mode is due to an open-loop system pole being attracted to an open-loop system zero. Furthermore, we use network decomposition method to explain why this mode is observable in individual vars while not observable in the total var. The entire system of n -turbines can be viewed as n decoupled circuits. For the two-turbine case, the system has an aggregated mode and a turbine-turbine oscillation mode. Here, the aggregated mode is associated with a circuit associated with the total var, while the turbine-turbine oscillation mode is associated with the var difference and is insensitive to the grid parameters.","IEEE","","National Renewable Energy Lab.

To unlock building DF as a predictable grid resource, we must establish a quantitative understanding of the resource size, performance variability, and predictability based on large empirical datasets. Researchers have proposed various sets of theoretical metrics to measure this performance. Some metrics have been applied to simulation results, but most fall short of exploring the complexities in real building applications. There are practical metrics used in individual demand response field studies but they alone cannot fulfil the job of DF benchmarking across a diverse group of buildings. The electrical grid's geographically diverse and changing nature presents challenges to comparing building DF performance measured under different conditions (i.e., benchmarking DF). To address this challenge, a novel DF benchmarking framework focused on load shedding and shifting is presented; the foundation is a set of simple, proven single-event metrics with attributes describing event conditions. These enable benchmarking and visualization in different dimensions for identifying trends that represent how these attributes influence DF. To test its feasibility and scalability, the DF framework was applied to two case studies of 11 office buildings and 121 big-box retail buildings with demand response participation data. Furthermore, these examples provided a pathway for using both building level benchmarking and aggregation to extract insights into building DF about magnitude, consistency, and influential factors. Potential applications of the framework and real-world values have been identified for grid and building stakeholders.","Elsevier","","Lawrence Berkeley National Lab.

Here we develop a novel trilevel programming model to optimally segment a grid communication system, taking into account the actions of an information technology (IT) administrator, attacker, and grid operator. The IT administrator is allowed to segment existing networks, and the attacker is given a budget to inflict damage on the grid by attacking the segmented communication system. Finally, the grid operator can redispatch the grid after the attack to minimize damage. The resulting problem is a trilevel interdiction problem that we solve using a branch and bound algorithm for bilevel problems. We demonstrate the benefits of optimal network segmentation through case studies on the 9-bus Western System Coordinating Council (WSCC) system and the 30-bus IEEE system.

Previous studies have shown that such a transition in the United States (U.S.) may lead to higher system cost compared to a business-as-usual case, but it is not well-known how the cost of electricity generation varies at sub-regional level under the transition, and studies have rarely evaluated the trade-off between the cost and avoided climate damages, as well as the potential roles of negative emission technologies (NETs) in the electricity decarbonization. In this work, we present a regionally resolved national model to quantify the cost of decarbonizing the U.S. electricity system under a set of possible scenarios. The results show that, compared to the reference scenario without a decarbonization policy, reaching zero CO<sub>2</sub> emission by 2050 would incur, depending on the scenarios, 335-494 billion USD additional cost to the U.S. electric power sector during 2020-2050. The regional costs of electricity generation ranges from 2.4 to 4.7 cent/kWh, largely due to the generation profiles and renewable resources availability of those regions. The additional costs can be translated to an average CO<sub>2</sub> abatement cost of 29-59 USD/metric ton CO<sub>2</sub> (with 2%-7% discount rates), which are comparable to the social cost of carbon in the literature at around 4% discount rate. The results also show that the cost of mitigating the last few percent CO<sub>2</sub> emission from the U.S. electricity system may exceed the costs of NETs, indicating an opportunity for NETs to contribute to electricity decarbonization.","Elsevier","","National Renewable Energy Lab.

"Feedback Control Strategy for Transient Stability Application","Ojetola, Samuel T.; Wold, Josh; Trudnowski, Daniel","24 POWER TRANSMISSION AND DISTRIBUTION; power system stability; transient analysis; energy storage; power system control; wide area measurements","Power systems are subjected to a wide range of disturbances during daily operations. Severe disturbances, such as a loss of a large generator, a three-phase bolted fault on a generator bus, or a loss of a transmission line, can lead to the loss of synchronism of a generator or group of generators. The ability of a power system to maintain synchronism during the few seconds after being subjected to a severe disturbance is known as transient stability. Most of the modern methods of controlling transient stability involve special protection schemes or remedial action schemes. These special protection schemes sense predetermined system conditions and take corrective actions, such as generator tripping or generation re-dispatch, in real time to maintain transient stability. Another method is the use of a real-time feedback control system to modulate the output of an actuator in response to a signal. This paper provides a fundamental evaluation of the use of feedback control strategies to improve transient stability in a power system. An optimal feedback control strategy that modulates the real power injected and absorbed by distributed energy-storage devices is proposed. Its performance is evaluated on a four-machine power system and on a 34-machine reduced-order model of the Western North American Power System. The result shows that the feedback control strategy can increase the critical fault clearing time by 60%, thereby improving the transient stability of the power system.","MDPI","","Sandia National Lab.

A systematic, transferrable, and scalable methodology has been designed to analyze and quantify the increased DER value from three perspectives: 1) curtailment reduction of the DER generation, 2) size reduction of the energy storage needed to otherwise realize DER hosting levels, and 3) hosting capacity improvement of the DERs compared to the base distribution circuit capability. In the case study, the proposed methodology is applied to two utility distribution systems for analysis and quantification of the grid value of the MVB2B converter, installed in the distribution circuit, and provided to the solar photovoltaic (PV) DERs. Here, the analysis results demonstrate that the MVB2B converter can deliver significant value to the PV hosting enhancement of two adjacent distribution systems when they are connected by the MVB2B converter.

"PowerNet: Multi-agent Deep Reinforcement Learning for Scalable Powergrid Control","Chen, Dong; Chen, Kaian; Li, Zhaojian; Chu, Tianshu; Yao, Rui; Qiu, Feng; Lin, Kaixiang","24 POWER TRANSMISSION AND DISTRIBUTION; distributed generators (DGs); inverter-based microgrid; multi-agent deep reinforcement learning; secondary voltage control","This paper develops an efficient multi-agent deep reinforcement learning algorithm for cooperative controls in powergrids. Specifically, we consider the decentralized inverter-based secondary voltage control problem in distributed generators (DGs), which is first formulated as a cooperative multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL) problem. We then propose a novel on-policy MARL algorithm, PowerNet, in which each agent (DG) learns a control policy based on (sub-)global reward but local states and encoded communication messages from its neighbors. Motivated by the fact that a local control from one agent has limited impact on agents distant from it, we exploit a novel spatial discount factor to reduce the effect from remote agents, to expedite the training process and improve scalability. Furthermore, a differentiable, learning-based communication protocol is employed to foster the collaborations among neighboring agents. In addition, to mitigate the effects of system uncertainty and random noise introduced during on-policy learning, we utilize an action smoothing factor to stabilize the policy execution. To facilitate training and evaluation, we develop PGSim, an efficient, high-fidelity powergrid simulation platform. Here, experimental results in two microgrid setups show that the developed PowerNet outperforms the conventional model-based control method, as well as several state-of-the-art MARL algorithms. The decentralized learning scheme and high sample efficiency also make it viable to large-scale power grids.","IEEE","","Argonne National Lab.

A conventional manual design procedure of such power converters is computation- and labor-intensive, which involves selecting and connecting component devices, tuning component-wise parameters and control schemes, and iteratively evaluating and optimizing the design. To automate and speed up this design process, we propose an automatic framework that designs custom power converters from design specifications using Monte Carlo Tree Search. Specifically, the framework embraces the upper-confidence-bound-tree (UCT), a variant of Monte Carlo Tree Search, to automate topology space exploration with circuit design specification-encoded reward signals. Moreover, our UCT-based approach can exploit small offline data via the specially designed default policy and can run in parallel to accelerate topology space exploration. Further, it utilizes a hybrid circuit evaluation strategy to substantially reduce design evaluation costs. Empirically, we demonstrated that our framework could generate energy-efficient circuit topologies for various target voltage conversion ratios. Compared to existing automatic topology optimization strategies, the proposed method is much more computationally efficient --- the sequential version can generate topologies with the same quality while being up to 67% faster. Here, the parallelization schemes can further achieve high speedups compared to the sequential version.","Association for Computing Machinery (ACM)","","IBM, Cambridge, MA (United States)","USDOE Advanced Research Projects Agency - Energy (ARPA-E); National Science Foundation (NSF)","","United States","2022-07-21T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: ACM Transactions on Design Automation of Electronic Systems; Journal Volume: 28; Journal Issue: 2","","Medium: ED; Size: p. 1-33; Article No. 17","","","AR0001210; CNS–1948457","Journal ID: ISSN 1084-4309","10.1145/3549538","","2023-02-13T00:00:00Z","1877055","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/1877055","","ACM Transactions on Design Automation of Electronic Systems","2","28"

While this coupling can bring operational and economic benefits, it can also yield challenges, as the constraints in one system can impact the other. Co-simulation can capture the constraints and interactions between these systems, but so far, there has been limited comparison of co-simulation results to those of an integrated model. In this work, we develop a new co-simulation framework using the HELICS platform and the SAInt tool for modeling transient gas and AC optimal power flow. We evaluate this co-simulation framework against a fully integrated version of the SAInt power and gas simulators, thus providing a benchmarking of the co-simulation approach. We compare results across the two approaches for two test networks and a network representing the Belgian power and gas networks, testing both normal operating conditions and cases with compressor disruptions. In each of the cases tested, we find nearly identical results from the two approaches across various metrics of interest, such as nodal pressure, gas flow rates, and active power generation.

To minimize energy storage requirements, it is advantageous to employ a quadruple active bridge (QAB) stage operating as a ""dc transformer"" in each stackable module. The QAB stage offers three isolated dc link voltages, which then allow for flexible stacking of three single-phase dc-to-ac inverter stages. Each of the module phases processes a pulsating power having a component at twice the line frequency. This presents a challenge in maintaining zero voltage switching (ZVS) on the secondary sides of the QAB during low-power portions of the line cycle. This article is focused on the design of the QAB stage. A detailed analysis of ZVS switching waveforms is presented, including effects of nonlinear device capacitances. It is shown how ZVS can be achieved at all times using a relatively small circulating current provided by the magnetizing inductance of the high-frequency transformer. Analytical expressions are given for the optimal values of the magnetizing inductance and the dead times of the QAB primary and secondary bridges. This approach is verified by experimental results on a 1 kV, 10-kW SiC-based prototype, demonstrating a relatively flat efficiency curve with a peak efficiency of 97.1% at 75% load.","IEEE","","National Renewable Energy Lab.

To provide fast online response and optimal sequential decision-making support, a reinforcement learning (RL) based approach is proposed to optimize the restoration. Due to the complexities stemming from the large policy search space, renewable uncertainty, and nonlinearity in a complex grid control problem, directly applying RL algorithms to train a satisfactory policy requires extensive tuning to be successful. To address this challenge, this paper leverages the curriculum learning (CL) technique to design a training curriculum involving a simpler steppingstone problem that guides the RL agent to learn to solve the original hard problem in a progressive and more effective manner. We demonstrate that compared with direct learning, CL facilitates controller training to achieve better performance. To study realistic scenarios where renewable forecasts used for decision-making are in general imperfect, the experiments compare the trained RL controllers against two model predictive controllers (MPCs) using renewable forecasts with different error levels and observe how these controllers can hedge against the uncertainty. Results show that RL controllers are less susceptible to forecast errors than the baseline MPCs and can provide a more reliable restoration process.","IEEE","","National Renewable Energy Lab.

The problem is that the microgrid frequency deviates from its nominal value after a load change. The presented method enables the inverters to restore the frequency to the nominal value and regulate their bus voltage amplitudes. The frequency and voltage restorations are performed without communication while achieving the desired power-sharing between grid-forming inverters. The restoration is activated after detecting any active or reactive power changes. In this article, the dynamic model of an inverter equipped with enabled restoration paths is developed to verify the stability of the inverter controller under various conditions.

Thermal energy storage (TES) systems would enable NPPs to respond nimbly to market variability and could also position advanced NPPs to participate differently in restructured markets, thus further enhancing their economic competitiveness. TES systems could also benefit the electric grid by eliminating the need for peaking plants, as well as by improving the economic performance of baseload NPPs. While TES technologies afford a unique opportunity to address many of these challenges, the applicability of these systems is also complicated by the fact that various advanced NPPs are designed differently, each with its own temperature range, size, operating fluids, and operating conditions. Hence, TES systems face significant barriers to investment, as more information on their compatibility and performance metrics is needed to quantify the advantages provided by each, as well as the challenges these technologies might face if coupled with a particular type of advanced NPP. This study explores the possibility of integrating a wide variety of TES technologies with various categories of advanced NPPs, based on their operating characteristics. To help decision makers, users and developers decide which TES technology is best suited to a particular category of advanced NPPs, this research present a Phenomena Identification and Ranking Table (PIRT) analysis of 10 TES systems that could potentially be coupled with advanced NPPs, which themselves are divided into nine categories based on their operating conditions. Then, each advanced NPP category is evaluated for compatibility with the 10 TES systems by assembling and discussing a database of information concerning 10 engineering questions, defined herein in as figures of merit (FOMs), such as: technology readiness level (TRL), temperature compatibility, energy density, size, cycle frequency, ramp time, realignment frequency, geographic needs, environmental impact, and interventions. By assembling a database of information concerning the TES technologies' compatibility with various advanced NPP systems, this study can help developers acquaint themselves with a particular TES technology before choosing to build a new integrated installation.","Elsevier","","Idaho National Lab.

"On the operational characteristics and economic value of pumped thermal energy storage","Martinek, Janna; Jorgenson, Jennie L.; McTigue, Joshua D.","25 ENERGY STORAGE; 24 POWER TRANSMISSION AND DISTRIBUTION; dispatch optimization; electricity storage; grid integration; pumped thermal energy storage","Pumped thermal energy storage (PTES) systems use an electrically-driven heat pump to store electricity in the form of thermal energy, and subsequently dispatch the stored thermal energy to generate electricity using a thermodynamic heat engine. Optimal day-ahead operational scheduling and annual value of a PTES system based on Joule-Brayton thermodynamic cycles and two-tank molten salt hot thermal storage is evaluated in this work. Production cost models, which simultaneously optimize commitment and dispatch schedules for an entire set of generators to minimize the cost of satisfying electricity demand, are employed to determine system-optimal operation and day-ahead energy value of the PTES system within each of six hypothetical near-future grid scenarios intended to approximately represent the U.S. Western Interconnection or the Texas Interconnection. Sensitivity to grid scenario (including the contribution of variable renewable energy sources), thermal storage capacity, relative heat pump and heat engine capacities, and startup/shutdown cycling costs are evaluated. PTES energy value and heat engine annual capacity factor increase strongly as the contribution of variable renewable resources increases, heat pump capacity increases relative to heat engine capacity, or PTES cycling costs decrease. Grid scenarios in which the contribution of variable renewable energy is dominated by solar photovoltaics (PV) vs. wind produce inherently different PTES operational patterns. Annual PTES energy value within PV-dominated scenarios increased with storage capacity only up to approximately seven hours of full-load discharge capacity, whereas that within wind-dominated scenarios exhibited a continual increase with storage duration up to at least 16 hours.","Elsevier","","National Renewable Energy Lab.

The reduced efficiency of response to natural hazards and disasters can extend the time that electrical service is not available for critical end-use loads, and in extreme events, leave the public without power for extended periods. This article presents a methodology for the development of a semantic data model for power systems and the integration of electrical grid topology, population, and electric distribution line reliability indices into a unified, cloud-based, serverless framework that supports power system operations in response to extreme events. An iterative and pragmatic approach to working with large and disparate datasets of different formats and types resulted in improved application runtime and efficiency, which is important to consider in real time decision-making processes during hurricanes and similar catastrophic events. This technology was developed initially for Puerto Rico, following extreme hurricane and earthquake events in 2017 and 2020, but is applicable to utilities around the world. Given the highly abstract and modular design approach, this technology is equally applicable to any geographic region and similar natural hazard events. In addition to a review of the requirements, development, and deployment of this framework, technical aspects related to application performance and response time are highlighted.","Springer","","Pacific Northwest National Lab.

The DC-link current minimization can significantly reduce power loss and improve efficiency. The challenge of this problem is on improving both steady-state and dynamic performance. PI control methods and large DC-link inductors are conventionally used in the CSC but have limited dynamic performance. A model predictive control (MPC) method is proposed to achieve switching-cycle-level settling time, and the DC-link inductor is sized for 40% ripple to enable fast current change. Importantly, this article also proposes to minimize the DC-link current by varying the current even within a line cycle under single-phase load to improve the steady-state performance, in contrast with the reduction to a constant value in the literature. The proposed MPC features a constant switching frequency without weighting factors. The MPC does not have a high computational burden and is implemented in a regular digital controller for a prototype of soft-switching solid-state transformer (S4T) with reduced conduction loss. The effectiveness of the proposed method has been experimentally verified on the SiC S4T prototype during steady-state and dynamics under different multiport power flow conditions up to 2 kV peak. Here, the DC-link current in the experiments is close to the minimum current with a short zero-vector duration, which further verifies the performance of the proposed method.","IEEE","","Georgia Institute of Technology, Atlanta, GA (United States)","USDOE Advanced Research Projects Agency - Energy (ARPA-E)","","United States","2022-05-27T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: IEEE Transactions on Power Electronics; Journal Volume: 37; Journal Issue: 10","","Medium: ED; Size: p. 11865-11875","","","AR0000899","Journal ID: ISSN 0885-8993","10.1109/tpel.2022.3178433","","2022-10-20T00:00:00Z","1892472","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/1892472","","IEEE Transactions on Power Electronics","10","37"

To ensure the efficient and reliable operation of electric grid, an accurate and general short-term forecasting algorithm with interpretability is desired. Moreover, the extensive off-site information provided by the proliferation of new renewable plants stimulates the interests in the spatiotemporal forecasting. In this paper, an attention temporal convolutional network, which is built on stacked dilated causal convolutional networks and attention mechanisms, is proposed to perform the ultra-short-term spatiotemporal forecasting of renewable resources. Compared with the existing spatiotemporal forecasting methods, the presented model needs no domain knowledge and can be applied to different forecasting tasks such as solar generation and wind speed forecasting. Here, the attention mechanism improves the interpretability. The algorithm can be used to produce both point and probabilistic forecasts. Numerical results on the data sets from National Renewable Energy Laboratory show superior performance over five baselines, in terms of skill scores. Compared with the baselines, the average improvements of accuracy introduced by the proposed method for the point and probabilistic forecasting are 15.08% and 15.85%, respectively.","IEEE","","North Carolina State Univ., Raleigh, NC (United States)","USDOE Office of Energy Efficiency and Renewable Energy (EERE), Renewable Power Office.

The DSRR strategy is formulated as a two-stage optimization. The first stage is a comprehensive co-optimization of repair crew scheduling, dynamic network reconfiguration, and distributed energy resource (DER) dispatch based on the forecast load profile. The goal is to minimize the accumulative operating cost caused by the load reduction payment as well as DER operating cost. In particular, since the number of available repair crews is usually smaller than the number of faulted lines after a disaster event, the DSRR strategy determines the optimal scheduling for repairing faulted lines. The second stage is a re-dispatch of the DER power output and load shedding based on the real-time load demand of each bus. The proposed algorithm is validated by case studies of the IEEE 33-bus and 123-bus test systems. We consider those scenarios in which faults occur in multiple heavy-loaded feeders. The simulation results demonstrate that the DSRR strategy effectively coordinate the repair scheduling, network reconfiguration and load shedding to minimize the operating cost.","Elsevier","","Oak Ridge National Lab.

Grid operators must commit resources to provide reserves to ensure reliable operations in the face of forecast errors, a process which can increase fuel consumption and emissions. We apply neural network-based machine learning to expand the usefulness of median point forecast data by creating probabilistic distributions of short-term uncertainty in demand, wind, and solar forecasts that adapt to prevailing grid conditions. Machine learning derived estimates of forecast errors compare favorably to estimates based on incumbent methods. Reserves derived from machine learning are usually smaller than values derived using incumbent methods, which enables fuel savings during most hours. Machine learning reserves are generally larger than incumbent reserves during times of higher forecast error, potentially improving system reliability. Performance is tested using multistage production simulation modeling of the California Independent System Operator system. Machine learning reserves provide production cost and greenhouse gas (GHG) emission reductions of approximately 0.3% relative to historical 2019 requirements. Savings in the 2030 timeframe are highly dependent on battery storage capacity. At lower levels of battery capacity, savings of 0.4% from machine learning reserves are shown. Significant quantities of battery storage are expected to be added to meet California's resource adequacy needs and GHG reduction targets.

A hierarchical local electricity market (LEM) structure is proposed in this paper with a secondary market (SM) at the lower level representing secondary feeders and a primary market (PM) at the upper level, representing primary feeders, in order to effectively use DERs to increase grid efficiency and resilience. The lower level SM enforces budget, power balance, and flexibility constraints and accounts for costs related to consumers, such as their disutility, flexibility limits, and commitment reliability, while the upper level PM enforces grid physics constraints such as power balance and capacity limits, and also minimizes line losses. The hierarchical LEM is extensively evaluated using a modified IEEE-123 bus with high DER penetration, with each primary feeder consisting of at least three secondary feeders. Data from a GridLAB-D model is used to emulate realistic power injections and load profiles over the course of 24 hours. The performance of the LEM is illustrated by delineating the family of power-injection profiles across the primary and secondary feeders as well as corresponding local electricity tariffs that vary across the distribution grid. Through numerical simulations, the hierarchical LEM is shown to improve the efficiency of the market in terms of lowering overall costs, including both the distribution-level locational marginal prices (d-LMP) as well as retail tariffs paid by customers. Together, it represents an overall framework for a Distribution System Operator (DSO) who can provide the oversight for the entire LEM.","IEEE","","National Renewable Energy Lab.

Here, we derive the conditions that guarantee synchronization in power networks with inherent generator heterogeneity when subjected to small perturbations, and perform a parametric sensitivity analysis to understand synchronization with varied types of generators. As inverter-based resources, which are the primary interfacing technology for many renewable sources of energy, have supplanted synchronous generators in ever growing numbers, the center of attention on associated integration challenges have resided primarily on the role of declining system inertia. Our results instead highlight the critical role of generator damping in achieving a stable state of synchronization. Additionally, we report the feasibility of operating interconnected electric grids with up to 100% power contribution from inverter-based renewable generation technologies. Our study has important implications as it sets the basis for the development of advanced control architectures and grid optimization methods that ensure synchronization and further pave the path towards the decarbonization of the electric power sector.","Nature Publishing Group","","National Renewable Energy Lab.

The proposed SST has some unique features. First, compared to the voltage-source or matrix converter-based SSTs, the current-source SST has a unique advantage of single-stage isolated AC/DC or AC/AC conversion with an inductive DC link, but no medium-voltage (MV) AC experiments have been reported. This article for the first time demonstrates MV AC current-source SST up to 7.5 kV peak. Second, the multiport SST has a buffer port for active power decoupling (APD) or energy storage integration. The double-line-frequency power ripple from single-phase AC grid normally results in a large capacitor size in MV SSTs. The APD scheme is proposed in MV applications for the first time to enable a reduced DC link and the electrolytic capacitor-less SST with high reliability. Third, as a direct grid-connected converter without line-frequency transformer, insulation and protection are critical. A medium-frequency transformer design passes 55 kV basic-insulation level (BIL) and 60 kV high potential dielectrics withstand test with only 0.09% leakage inductance. Importantly, a lightning protection scheme is presented to protect the SST itself from 90 kV BIL impulse. Fourth, the proposed current-source SST topology is a modular soft-switching solid-state transformer (M-S4T) with full-range zero-voltage switching and controlled dv/dt for low electromagnetic interference. Furthermore, these concepts are verified in a three-port M-S4T prototype with forced oil cooling under single-module, stacked-module, steady-state, and dynamic operations.","IEEE","","Georgia Institute of Technology, Atlanta, GA (United States)","USDOE Advanced Research Projects Agency - Energy (ARPA-E)","","United States","2022-05-06T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: IEEE Transactions on Power Electronics; Journal Volume: 37; Journal Issue: 10","","Medium: ED; Size: p. 12080-12094","","","AR0000899","Journal ID: ISSN 0885-8993","10.1109/tpel.2022.3172946","","2022-10-20T00:00:00Z","1892474","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/1892474","","IEEE Transactions on Power Electronics","10","37"

Although distribution systems are increasingly equipped with sensing devices and smart meters, measurements are typically reported at different rates and asynchronously; these aspects pose severe strains on workhorse state estimation algorithms, which are designed to process batches of data collected in a synchronous manner from all the measurement units. In this paper, we develop a novel state estimation algorithm to continuously update the estimate of the state based on measurements received in an asynchronous manner from measurement units. The synthesis of the algorithm hinges on a proximal-point type method, implemented in an online fashion, and capable of processing measurements received sequentially from sensors. A performance analysis is presented by providing bounds on the estimation error in terms of the mean and variance that hold at each iteration and asymptotically. The scheme is also compared with a more traditional Weighted Least Squares estimator that compensates for the lack of measurement data by using, as pseudo measurements, the measurement retrieved during a certain time window. Numerical simulations on the IEEE 37-bus feeder corroborate the analytical findings.","IEEE","","National Renewable Energy Lab.

One critical issue of the single-phase SST is the double-line-frequency power ripple. Traditionally, large passives are used to buffer the ripple, resulting in significantly increased volume and cost. This article for the first time proposes active power decoupling (APD) for the SST and a predictive direct DC-link control method, using a current-source single-stage SST as an example. An electrolytic capacitor-less buffer port is used to absorb the ripple, which tolerates up to a 30% voltage ripple for small capacitance. The APD SST control is challenging. First, the current-source SST realizes isolation, DC link, and multiport in a single stage. Second, different from conventional SSTs or APD converters, the low-inertia DC link in this SST has a 40% switching ripple, which is difficult to stabilize. To address the control challenge, a direct DC-link control architecture and a predictive control method are proposed. Simulation and experimental results verify the proposed control method on an MV SiC modular soft-switching solid-state transformer (M-S4T) prototype. Here, the proposed APD reduces the SST volume by 53.8%. Importantly, the proposed concept is not limited to the M-S4T but is generic to other SSTs or APD converters.","IEEE","","Georgia Institute of Technology, Atlanta, GA (United States)","USDOE Advanced Research Projects Agency - Energy (ARPA-E)","","United States","2022-05-06T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: IEEE Transactions on Power Electronics; Journal Volume: 37; Journal Issue: 10","","Medium: ED; Size: p. 11673-11685","","","AR0000899","Journal ID: ISSN 0885-8993","10.1109/tpel.2022.3172957","","2022-10-20T00:00:00Z","1892473","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/1892473","","IEEE Transactions on Power Electronics","10","37"

When operating by themselves, it has been shown that these devices can provide individual benefits, maintaining some level of convenience, grid stability, and quality of life. However, a clean and sustainable energy future requires the coordinated control of these edge devices on a large scale with state-of-the art control and optimization theory innovation integrated with abundant sensor information. In this work, we take a step toward this vision by proposing a method to explore whether two different types of devices can coordinate to reach consensus on a global objective while continuing to provide their individual benefits. Due to their high impact on the grid and quality of life, this proof-of-concept work focuses on the optimal control of buildings and electric vehicle charging. It is shown that the novel algorithm, termed Network Lasso - Alternating Direction Method of Multipliers - Limited Communication Distributed Model Predictive Control (NALD), successfully achieves the global objective by tracking a power reference from the grid. Simultaneously, the peak electric vehicle charging load is minimized while fully charging each electric vehicle and the internal building temperature is regulated within specified temperature bounds.

"A Multi-Model Framework for Assessing Long- and Short-Term Climate Influences on the Electric Grid","Cohen, Stuart M.; Dyreson, Ana; Turner, Sean; Tidwell, Vince; Voisin, Nathalie; Miara, Ariel","54 ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCES; 24 POWER TRANSMISSION AND DISTRIBUTION; climate change; drought; electricity; electricity planning; grid operations; hydrology","Climate change influences many aspects of the electric grid, but prior work and industry practices often ignore the potential effects of changing climate, or they only consider a single effect or individual effects in isolation. Challenges vary with each grid and include adapting to long-term trends such as changing temperature and precipitation or shorter-term events such as drought or storms that could increase in frequency or intensity. Here we present a multi-model framework designed to analyze the effects of long and short-term climate impacts in combination. This framework couples capacity expansion and production cost models with hydrologic models and future climate scenario data to analyze alternative climate and energy futures at high spatial, temporal, and process resolutions. We constructed and evaluated the results of a suite of simulated scenarios exploring climate impacts on capacity investment and stress-tested the resulting future infrastructures using hourly dispatch modeling under alternative drought and load conditions. We demonstrate the approach through a case study of the U.S. Western Interconnection, where climate impacts depend on interactions between temperature-induced load, water availability for hydropower, technology competitiveness, and demand flexibility. Changes in 2038 generating capacity range from -8.5-16.6 GW, and changes in 2038 transmission capacity range from -1-2 GW. Capacity increases are driven by higher load from higher temperatures, while capacity reductions can be achieved in scenarios with higher future hydropower availability and increased demand flexibility. Scenarios requiring additional capacity cost an additional $5-$17 billion (discounted) from 2018 to 2038; however, scenarios with capacity reductions cost $1-$18 billion less. Stress tests on four 2038 infrastructures demonstrated that the identified systems were able to serve at least 99.999% of load and 99.96% of reserves. However, drought and unexpected high-load conditions can result in reduced capacity to respond to contingency events we did not model. Although these results are system and scenario specific, they highlight the importance of considering multiple climate change impacts simultaneously in long-term planning efforts and demonstrate a multi-model, multiscale approach that can be flexibly applied to any system and set of climate change concerns.","Elsevier","","National Renewable Energy Lab.

However, system-level changes that affect the net-load such as increased variable renewable energy (VRE) generation and widespread deployment of energy efficiency (EE) also affect the type, magnitude and timing of DR required to support the grid. In this study, we use publicly available system-level data to define seven metrics to assess how these changes affect system-level shed and shift DR needs. Specifically, there are four metrics for grid conditions when DR has the highest system value and three metrics for DR program design that were developed by considering the magnitude and temporal distribution of net-load. We also develop three stylized load shape profiles illustrating EE measure impacts and one high VRE generation profile to demonstrate the application of these metrics. The results confirm the robustness of the metrics to identify complex interactions between demand-side and supply-side resources that can affect the DR need. Widespread application of our metrics can help system planners and operators be cognizant of such interactions and identify the DR need for the system in a way that can be most valuable.","Elsevier","","Lawrence Berkeley National Lab.

However, all existing studies myopically perturb the reactance of D-FACTS lines without considering the system voltage stability. In this paper, we first illustrate voltage instability induced by MTDs in a three-bus system. To address this issue, we further propose a novel MTD framework that explicitly considers system voltage stability by using continuation power flow and voltage stability indices. We mathematically derive the sensitivity matrix of voltage stability index to line impedance, on which an optimization problem for maximizing voltage stability index is formulated. This framework is tested on the IEEE 14-bus and the IEEE 118-bus transmission systems, in which net load redistribution attacks are launched by sophisticated attackers. Here, the simulation results show the effectiveness of the proposed framework in circumventing the voltage instability while maintaining the detection effectiveness of MTD. We conduct case studies with and without the proposed framework under different MTD planning and operational methods. The impacts of the proposed two methods on attack detection effectiveness and system economic metrics are also revealed.","IEEE","","Kansas State Univ., Manhattan, KS (United States)","USDOE Office of Energy Efficiency and Renewable Energy (EERE), Renewable Power Office.

All-electric buildings are becoming a trend among new constructions, introducing opportunities for decarbonization but also technical challenges and research gaps. For instance, further investigation is needed to understand how the adoption of energy efficiency measures (EEMs) and distributed energy resources (DERs) in all-electric communities would affect energy consumption, carbon emissions, and grid planning. This paper presents a case study of a mixed-use, all-electric community located in Denver, Colorado. We use URBANopt<sup>TM</sup>, a physics-based urban energy modeling platform to model the community and then evaluate the impact of EEMs and DERs (i.e., photovoltaics [PV], electric vehicles [EVs], and batteries) on the community's energy usage, carbon emissions, and peak demand. The results show that adding EEMs and PV led to both energy consumption and carbon emissions reductions across all building types. However, we saw fairly limited impact of EEMs and PV on buildings' peak demand in our case. Additionally, due to overnight EV charging activities and higher grid carbon intensity at night, the carbon emissions in multifamily buildings have a noticeable increase compared to scenarios without vehicles. Finally, the addition of batteries helped reduce peak demand by 11%-29%. The modeling workflow and evaluation methods can be applied to similar communities to evaluate their performance and the effect of integrating EEMs and DERs.","Elsevier","","National Renewable Energy Lab.

However, due to the vulnerability of the WAMS communication, WAMS based HVDC system control can be a prime target of malicious penetrations that could lead to disastrous events. To remediate this adverse effect, an improved WAMS based HVDC damping control framework is proposed in this paper. First, a lightweight network named Attack Shuffle convolutional neural Networks (ASNet) is proposed to learn the characteristics of cyber attacks. Then, a model-free-based cyber attack defense framework is introduced to quickly identify the attack types based on the continuous wavelet transform and ASNet. Additionally, an improved control framework of the WAMS and HVDC-based wide-area power oscillation damping control (WH-PODC) is developed to provide different response control for mitigation of the impact of cyber attacks. Finally, the performance of the proposed WH-PODC control framework is evaluated with real PMU data in multiple scenarios in RTDS, where the results indicate that the response intensity can be kept under multiple types of cyber attacks while providing similar effectiveness in oscillation suppression to conventional controls.","IEEE","","Oak Ridge National Lab.

However, a transformer’s cellulose-based paper insulation and the mineral oil in which it is immersed break down over time under standard operating conditions—or more rapidly due to potential faults within the system. As the transformer’s mineral oil breaks down, gases are released that can be measured and monitored. This technical brief exhibits a collection of diagnostic and prognostic techniques that utilities can adopt in lieu of labor-intensive periodic preventive maintenance routines. Furthermore, prognostic models have been incorporated using the latest version of the Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers (IEEE) standard (IEEE, 2019) for dissolved gas analysis (DGA), thus expanding it to include estimation of the time to maintenance. Overall, four different methodologies are explained, each of which aids in determining a transformer’s state of health. These methodologies include the Chendong model, the IEEE thermal life consumption model (IEEE, 2012), a diagnostic model for DGA, and a prognostic model for DGA that uses an autoregressive integrated moving average (ARIMA) model.

Going forward, with the application of appropriate controls, they can offer additional grid services, such as regulating reserves. Additional grid services can present an opportunity for additional value streams to wind and solar power plants. However, the additional value might not be realized when operator-determined performance targets and settlement adjustments for the delivery of regulation capacity are disregarded. Additionally, this article studies the participation of variable resources in centralized regulation markets. We derive analytical results for regulation offers in terms of quantity and price considering that a variable resource does not want to risk being disqualified as a regulation provider, incurring losses, or foregoing more profitable opportunities. Our analysis suggests that U.S. operator-determined performance targets impose an upper bound on the quantity of a variable resource’s regulation offer; and settlement adjustments for the delivery of regulation affect the price at which variable resources offer and the calculations of opportunity costs in case of imperfect regulation delivery.","IEEE","","National Renewable Energy Lab.

A severe forced oscillation event can deteriorate power system dynamic stability, damage equipment, and limit power transfer capability. This paper proposes a two-dimension scanning forced oscillation grid vulnerability analysis method to identify areas/zones in the system that are critical to forced oscillation. These critical areas/zones can be further considered as effective actuator locations for the deployment of forced oscillation damping controllers. Additionally, active power modulation control through IBRs is also proposed to reduce the forced oscillation impact on the entire grid. The proposed methods are demonstrated through a case study on a synthetic Texas power system model. The simulation results demonstrate that the critical areas/zones of forced oscillation are related to the areas that highly participate in the natural oscillations and the proposed oscillation damping controller through IBRs can effectively reduce the forced oscillation impact in the entire system.","MDPI","","Oak Ridge National Lab.

"Extension of the Generic Multi-Frequency Modelling Method for Type 3 Wind Turbines","Nouri, Behnam; Kocewiak, Łukasz Hubert; Shah, Shahil; Koralewicz, Przemyslaw; Gevorgian, Vahan; Srensen, Poul","24 POWER TRANSMISSION AND DISTRIBUTION; frequency couplings; generic multi-frequency modelling; perturbation test; Type 3 WTs","Reflecting potential non-linearities of converter-based systems, especially frequency and sequence couplings, is an ongoing challenge for linearized multi-frequency models. Besides, design details are required to develop such models, which either are the intellectual property of manufacturers or require experimental tests. The generic multi-frequency modelling method has been proposed to fill this gap; however, it is only developed for converter-connected systems, e.g., Type 4 Wind Turbines (WT). This paper proposes to extend the application of the generic multi-frequency modelling method for Type 3 WTs. In this way, a theory for patterns of the couplings in Type 3 WTs is proposed. Accordingly, a group of emissions and couplings are Rotor-Speed-Dependent (RSD). The RSD emissions and couplings are particular characteristics of Type 3 WTs, which should be addressed in the generic multi-frequency models. Additionally, the proposed theory is verified by unique-worldwide experimental perturbation tests on a 2 MVA Type 3 WT using a 7 MVA grid emulator. Accordingly, a limited number of RSD couplings and emissions are observed in the test results, mainly in low frequencies (below 1 kHz). Therefore, addressing the RSD couplings is practical and important to extend the generic multi-frequency modelling for Type 3 WTs.","IEEE","","National Renewable Energy Lab.

We investigated the sensitivity of a Western U.S. power system to isolated and combined heat and drought when it has low (5%) and moderate (31%) variable renewable energy shares, representing historic and future systems. We used an electricity operational model combined with a model of historically extreme drought (for hydropower and freshwater-reliant thermoelectric generators) over the Western U.S. and a synthetic, regionally extreme heat event in Southern California (for thermoelectric generators and electricity load). We found that the drought has the highest impact on summertime production cost (+10% to +12%), while temperature-based deratings have minimal effect (at most +1%). The Southern California heat wave scenario impacting load increases summertime regional net imports to Southern California by 10-14%, while the drought decreases them by 6-12%. Combined heat and drought conditions have a moderate effect on imports to Southern California (-2%) in the historic system and a stronger effect (+8%) in the future system. Southern California dependence on other regions decreases in the summertime with the moderate increase in variable renewable energy (-34% imports), but hourly peak regional imports are maintained under those infrastructure changes. By combining synthetic and historically driven conditions to test two infrastructures, we consolidate the importance of considering compounded heat wave and drought in planning studies and suggest that region-to-region energy transfers during peak periods are key to optimal operations under climate extremes.","American Geophysical Union (AGU)","","National Renewable Energy Lab.

Loss of utility caused by natural and human-made disasters may isolate each residential subdivision from the utility. In this case, the household loads are supplied by distributed generation (DG) units which may not be enough to meet the load demand. This can lead to deviations in voltage and frequency, and the deviations may vary for each phase. The proposed solution is to form an interphase-microgrid by seamlessly interconnecting the islanded single-phase feeders. This interphase-microgrid can effectively balance the load demands and DG generation in distribution systems after losing the utility supply. This paper presents different case studies to demonstrate the viability of forming interphase-microgrids for residential distribution systems.","IEEE","","Kansas State Univ., Manhattan, KS (United States)","USDOE Office of Energy Efficiency and Renewable Energy (EERE), Renewable Power Office.

"Peer-to-Peer Energy Trading under Network Constraints Based on Generalized Fast Dual Ascent","Feng, Changsen; Liang, Bomiao; Li, Zhengmao; Liu, Weijia; Wen, Fushuan","24 POWER TRANSMISSION AND DISTRIBUTION; event-driven; generalized fast dual ascent; market clearing; peer-to-peer (P2P) energy trading","We report the wide deployment of renewable energy resources, combined with a more proactive demand-side management, is inducing a new paradigm in both power system operation and electricity market trading, which especially boosts the emergence of the peer-to-peer (P2P) market. A more flexible local market mechanism is highly desirable in response to fast changes in renewable power generation at the distribution network level. Moreover, large-scale implementation of P2P energy trading inevitably affects the secure and economic operation of the distribution network. This paper presents a new P2P electricity trading framework with distribution network security constraints considered using the generalized fast dual ascent method. First, an event-driven local P2P market framework is presented to facilitate short-term or immediate local energy transactions. Then, the sensitivity analysis of nodal voltage and network loss with respect to nodal power injections is used to evaluate the impacts of P2P transactions on the distribution network, which ensures the secure operation of the distribution system. Thereby, the external operational constraints are internalized, and the cost of P2P energy trading can be appropriately allocated in an endogenous way. Moreover, a generalized fast dual ascent method is employed to implement distributed market-clearing efficiently. Finally, numerical results indicate that the proposed model could guarantee secure operation of the distribution system with P2P energy trading, and the solution method enjoys good convergence performance.","IEEE","","National Renewable Energy Lab.

First, we augment a priori known state-space model by reformulating parameters deemed uncertain as pseudo-state variables. Then, we apply the Koopman operator theory to the resulting state-space model and obtain a linear dynamical system model. This transformation allows us to analyze the evolution of the system dynamics through its Koopman eigenfunctions, eigenvalues, and modes. Of particular importance for this letter, the obtained linear dynamical system is a surrogate that enables the evaluation of parameter uncertainties by simply perturbing the initial conditions of the Koopman eigenfunctions associated with the pseudo-state variables. Simulations carried out on the New England test system reveal the excellent performance of the proposed method in terms of accuracy and computational efficiency.","IEEE","","National Renewable Energy Lab.

"Data-Driven Probabilistic Voltage Risk Assessment of MiniWECC System with Uncertain PVs and Wind Generations using Realistic Data","Ye, Ketian; Zhao, Junbo; Zhang, Hongming; Zhang, Yingchen","24 POWER TRANSMISSION AND DISTRIBUTION; 17 WIND ENERGY; MiniWECC; probabilistic power flow; renewable energy; sparse Gaussian process; uncertainty quantification","Here, it is found from actual data that due to generation dispatch and uncertain renewable generations and loads with complicated correlations, inferring the probabilistic distributions for uncertain inputs is challenging. Many probabilistic power flow approaches have been developed in the literature but their validations using realistic systems and data are lacking. This paper proposes a data-driven probabilistic analysis approach for system risk assessment of the miniWECC system using actual data. The sparse Gaussian process (SGP) is advocated to quantify the impacts of uncertain inputs on voltage security. SGP does not need the probability distribution function of uncertain inputs, can handle correlations and is highly computationally efficient. Results on the miniWECC system using realistic data show that SGP outperforms existing approaches and is able to quantify the voltage violation risks.","IEEE","","National Renewable Energy Lab.

In particular, we consider a setting where the network is divided into multiple areas. The measured physical quantities at buses located in the same area are processed by an area controller. A three-way tensor is constructed to collect these measured quantities. The measurements are analyzed locally to recover the full state information of the network. A distributed closed-form iterative algorithm based on the alternating direction method of multipliers is developed to obtain the low-rank factors of the whole network state tensor where information exchange happens only between neighboring areas. The convergence properties of the distributed algorithm and the sufficient conditions on the number of samples for each smaller network that guarantee the identifiability of the factors of the state tensor are presented. To demonstrate the efficacy of the proposed algorithm and to check the identifiability conditions, numerical simulations are carried out using the IEEE 123-bus system and a large-scale real utility feeder.","IEEE","","National Renewable Energy Lab.

This paper proposes a new deep reinforcement learning (RL) based model-free on-line dynamic MMGF scheme. Additionally, the dynamic MMGF problem is formulated as a Markov decision process, and a complete deep RL framework is specially designed for the topologytransformable micro-grids. In order to reduce the large action space caused by flexible switch operations, a topology transformation method is proposed and an action-decoupling Q-value is applied. Then, a convolutional neural network (CNN) based multi-buffer double deep Q-network (CM-DDQN) is developed to further improve the learning ability of the original DQN method. The proposed deep RL method provides real-time computing to support the on-line dynamic MMGF scheme, and the scheme handles a long-term resilience enhancement problem using an adaptive on-line MMGF to defend changeable conditions.

"Dynamic signal recovery in distribution grids using compressive lossy measurements","Karimi, Hazhar Sufi; Natarajan, Balasubramaniam","24 POWER TRANSMISSION AND DISTRIBUTION; Distribution systems state estimation; Smart grids; Dynamic compressive sensing; Kalman filtered compressive sensing; Packet losses","Distribution system state estimation requires reliable aggregation of the measured data. However, the large volume of the measured data imposes a significant stress on the underlying communication infrastructure. With the challenges associated with measurement availability, current distribution systems are typically unobservable. To cope with the unobservability issue, compressive sensing theory allows us to recover system state information from a small number of measurements provided the states of the distribution system exhibit sparsity. In this paper, we evaluate the robustness of an updated Kalman filtered modified compressive sensing (KF-ModCS) technique that dynamically estimates the grid states using a small fraction of measured data. In practice, measurements used for sparsity based state estimation may also be intermittent due to communication network induced losses. Further, to understand the effect of packet losses on KF-ModCS, we provide an upper bound for the expected variances of the state estimation error for a given rate of information loss. This upper bound is further improved if the support set of the sparse signal that characterizes the state dynamics does not change over time and/or the reduced model is observable. Simulations based on two practical data sets collected from actual customers in a distribution grid validate the theoretical results.","Elsevier","","Kansas State Univ., Manhattan, KS (United States)","USDOE Office of Energy Efficiency and Renewable Energy (EERE), Renewable Power Office.

Current methods often rely on historical data to estimate the requirements of ramping products and fail to take into account the effects of the latest weather conditions and their uncertainties, which could lead to overly conservative or insufficient requirements. This study proposes a k-nearest-neighbor-based method to give weather-informed estimates of ramping needs based on short-term probabilistic solar irradiance forecasts. Forecasts from multiple sites are employed in conjunction with principal component analysis to derive numerical classifiers to characterize system-level weather conditions. In addition, we develop a data-driven method to optimize the model parameters in a rolling-forward manner. By using real-world data from the California Independent System Operator, we design two metrics to evaluate method performance: 1) frequency of shortage and 2) oversupply of ramping product. Our proposed method presents advantages in comparison with the baseline and a set of benchmark methods: without compromising system reliability, it reduces system ramping requirements by up to 25%, therefore improving both system reliability and economics.","Elsevier","","National Renewable Energy Lab.

One essential application is the use of PMU data for real-time event identification. However, how to take full advantage of all PMU data in event identification is still an open problem. Thus, we propose a novel method that performs event identification by mining interaction graphs among different PMUs. The proposed interaction graph inference method follows an entirely data-driven manner without knowing the physical topology. Moreover, unlike previous works that treat interactive learning and event identification as two different stages, our method learns interactions jointly with the identification task, thereby improving the accuracy of graph learning and ensuring seamless integration between the two stages. Moreover, to capture multi-scale event patterns, a dilated inception-based method is investigated to perform feature extraction of PMU data. To test the proposed data-driven approach, a large real-world dataset from tens of PMU sources and the corresponding event logs have been utilized in this work. We report numerical results validate that our method has higher classification accuracy compared to previous methods.","IEEE","","Iowa State Univ., Ames, IA (United States)","USDOE Office of Electricity (OE)","","United States","2022-03-10T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: IEEE Transactions on Power Systems; Journal Volume: 38; Journal Issue: 1","","Medium: ED; Size: p. 617-629","","","OE0000910","Journal ID: ISSN 0885-8950","10.1109/tpwrs.2022.3158248","","2023-03-10T00:00:00Z","1866732","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/1866732","https://www.osti.gov/servlets/purl/1866732","IEEE Transactions on Power Systems","1","38"

At the system level, the impacts of extreme natural disasters are quantified. At the component level, the importance of individual components is analyzed through pre-failure and post-failure indices. The pre-failure index identifies the system’s weak links before an energy interruption, and the post-failure index determines the optimal repair strategy to restore the service. The proposed indices are solved by the impact increment method (IIM), which significantly improves computational efficiency without much affecting result accuracy.

However, as an intrinsically cyber-physical system, an MIDC system could suffer from cyber-attacks, leading to massive power mismatches in multiple AC systems, and resulting in catastrophic consequences. Since the sequential responses of an MIDC system and interconnected AC systems are in different timescales, this paper first establishes a two-timescale model to evaluate the sequential impacts caused by cyber-attacks. Then, an event-triggered cyber-defense strategy is proposed to enhance the cybersecurity of an MIDC system by mitigating multiple non-simultaneous cyber-attacks. Whenever new cyber-attack events occur, the proposed cyber-defense strategy, which is mathematically modeled as a mixed-integer quadratic programming problem, is executed on-line and updated in an event-triggered manner.

"Enabling DER Participation in Frequency Regulation Markets","Srivastava, Priyank; Chang, Chin-Yao; Cortes, Jorge","24 POWER TRANSMISSION AND DISTRIBUTION; distributed energy resources; frequency regulation market; microgrid abstractions; network optimization","Distributed energy resources (DERs) are playing an increasing role in ancillary services for the bulk grid, particularly in frequency regulation. In this article, we propose a framework for collections of DERs, combined to form microgrids and controlled by aggregators, to participate in frequency regulation markets. Our approach covers both the identification of bids for the market clearing stage and the mechanisms for the real-time allocation of the regulation signal. The proposed framework is hierarchical, consisting of a top layer and a bottom layer. The top layer consists of the aggregators communicating in a distributed fashion to optimally disaggregate the regulation signal requested by the system operator. The bottom layer consists of the DERs inside each microgrid whose power levels are adjusted so that the tie line power matches the output of the corresponding aggregator in the top layer. The coordination at the top layer requires the knowledge of cost functions, ramp rates, and capacity bounds of the aggregators. We develop meaningful abstractions for these quantities respecting the power flow constraints and taking into account the load uncertainties and propose a provably correct distributed algorithm for optimal disaggregation of regulation signals among the microgrids.","IEEE","","National Renewable Energy Lab.

High share of distributed energy resources (DERs) can create complicated system operation modes that may invalidate the traditional long-term voltage stability analysis based on typical operation modes. To address this challenge, this paper investigates how to compute the shortest path to the voltage stability boundary in the DER aggregated load space with large dispersion. Instead of working in the Euclidean space, we establish the analysis and computations on the algebraic power flow manifold to better capture the curvature change of the shortest path along the direction of losing stability. A modified optimal control framework is presented for obtaining the ground-truth of the smooth shortest path on the manifold. To efficiently and accurately solve for the shortest path, we further leverage the geometric features of the power flow manifold and propose a tri-sectional approximation model that is scalable for large-scale systems. Several numerical examples, up to the 1354-bus system, with different DER penetration levels and high dimensional renewable power injection variations are evaluated. The simulation results demonstrate that the tri-sectional approximation achieves high accuracy and efficiency to approximate the shortest path to the voltage stability boundary.","IEEE","","National Renewable Energy Lab.

In this work we evaluate a lesser known metric - the long-run marginal emission rate (LRMER) - which incorporates both the operational and structural implication of changes in electricity demand. We apply a modeling framework to compare the LRMER to the two near-ubiquitous metrics, and show that the LRMER can outperform the other two metrics at anticipating the emissions induced by a range of interventions. This suggests that adopting the LRMER could improve decision-making, particularly by better capturing the projected role of renewable generators in the evolution of the power sector.","Elsevier","","National Renewable Energy Lab.

Protection becomes even more challenging for multi-terminal dc (MTdc) systems with more than two terminals/converter stations. In this paper, a hybrid primary fault detection algorithm for MTdc systems is proposed to detect a broad range of failures. Sensor measurements, i.e., line currents and dc reactor voltages measured at local terminals, are first processed by a top-level context clustering algorithm. For each cluster, the best fault detector is selected among a detector pool according to a rule resulting from a learning algorithm. The detector pool consists of several existing detection algorithms, each performing differently across fault scenarios. The proposed hybrid primary detection algorithm: i) offers superior performance compared to an individual detector through a data-driven approach; ii) detects all major fault types including pole-to-pole (P2P), pole-to-ground (P2G), and external dc faults; iii) identifies faults with various fault locations and impedances; iv) is more robust to noisy sensor measurements compared to existing methods; v) does not require exhaustive simulation and sampling for training the model. Performance and effectiveness of the proposed algorithm are evaluated and verified based on time-domain simulations in the PSCAD/EMTDC software environment.

"Grid-Supportive Loads - A New Approach to Increasing Renewable Energy in Power Systems","Jain, Himanshu; Mather, Barry; Jain, Akshay Kumar; Baldwin, Samuel F.","24 POWER TRANSMISSION AND DISTRIBUTION; electric vehicles; inverters; load modeling; power system dynamics; power system modeling; power system stability; renewable energy resources; solar power generation; wind power generation","This paper demonstrates the potential of inverter-based loads to support grid reliability during power system transients thereby enabling reliable integration of renewable energy in power systems. Such loads are referred to in this paper as grid-supportive loads (GSLs). A new GSL model is developed that simulates the transient response capabilities that can be programmed in electronic loads. The model’s design enables it to be easily integrated in widely used commercial power system transient analysis software. Theoretical expressions are derived that explain the workings of the GSL model. The performance, numerical stability, and impact of the GSL model is validated on 9-bus and 2000-bus synthetic power system models using generator tripping and bus fault disturbances. Results on the 2000 bus system show that in the absence of frequency support from wind/solar generation resources, just 20% of loads with grid-supportive capabilities can improve frequency response by up to 2000 MW/0.1 Hz and reduce deviation in frequency at nadir by up to 60% compared to the situation when GSLs are absent. Power system reliability also improves under fault events. Here, it is further shown that GSLs can aid in integrating more renewable generation without degrading the overall transient response of the power system.","IEEE","","National Renewable Energy Lab.

In addition to the variable nature of many renewable generation sources (because of the weather-driven nature of their fuel supply), these newer sources vary in size - from residential-scale rooftop systems to utility-scale power plants - and they are interconnected throughout the electric grid, both from within the distribution system and directly to the high-voltage transmission system.

In the traditional dynamic economic dispatch (DED) of transmission systems, the frequency and voltage regulation effects are not actively utilized. In addition, the transmission systems and distribution systems are optimized separately; the transmission–distribution coordination effect is not considered. In this article, a new DED is proposed. The optimal scheduling results are obtained by making a balance between operating cost and reliability cost. Both the automatic regulation effect and transmission–distribution coordination effect are explored and exploited in terms of the equivalent reserve, which can reduce the reserve provided by generating units, and can further enhance the security and economics of power system operation. The validity and effectiveness of the proposed model are illustrated by case studies.","IEEE","External Audience (Unlimited)","Lawrence Livermore National Lab.

If wind power plants are not able to restore a power system, the incorporation of wind resources into electric grids could be limited by blackstart capability. This paper tackles this problem by setting forth a grid-forming controller for Type 4 wind turbines which employ fully rated power converters. To this end, we engineer two-axis anti-windup proportional-integral regulators that serve to ride through restoration disturbances. We also design an active protection system to prevent wind turbines from stalling during recovery from blackouts. We demonstrate in a high-fidelity simulation environment that Type 4 wind turbines with the developed controllers and protection subsystem can: (i) re-energize a notional wind-dominant grid; (ii) ride through asymmetrical faults; and (iii) survive low wind speed events.","IEEE","","National Renewable Energy Lab.

"Self-Organizing Map-Based Resilience Quantification and Resilient Control of Distribution Systems Under Extreme Events","Utkarsh, Kumar; Ding, Fei","24 POWER TRANSMISSION AND DISTRIBUTION; distributed energy resource; grid resilience; model predictive control; self-organizing maps","Due to climate change, extreme weather events are occurring more frequently and with increasing impact. This trend poses a significant challenge for distribution system operators (DSO) to ensure that there is uninterrupted power supply to critical loads in their networks. To embed resilience into DSO's decision-making, resilience needs to be first quantified and then integrated into the system-level optimization. Therefore, this paper first develops a novel self-organizing map (SOM) based method (called SomRes) to quantify the time-varying resilience index of a system that can leverage the powerful classification property of SOMs and removes some of the disadvantages of subjective weight assignment methods. Using SomRes, a resilient resource allocation and operational dispatch algorithm is further developed to enhance system resilience against extreme events by considering the SomRes resilience index directly as the feedback. Here, the proposed resilience quantification approach is benchmarked with a state-of-the-art approach and the efficacy of the proposed resilient dispatch algorithm is demonstrated through several deterministic and statistical case studies on the IEEE 123-bus distribution system. Simulation studies show that the proposed SomRes quantification method is an appropriate indicator of system resilience, and the resilient resource allocation and dispatch strategy can significantly reduce critical load shedding under varying event propagation scenarios.","IEEE","","National Renewable Energy Lab.

An effective solution must not ignore the power-communication interdependency as various systems are getting increasingly connected in the Smart Grid era. In this paper, we propose a two-layer distribution system model with both power and communication components. Based on this model, we formulate the restoration process as a routing problem that schedules the path and action sequence of utility crews that involves repairing damaged components, closing power switches, and enabling communication paths between the control center and remote field devices. Further, we develop a simulation-based method to quantitatively evaluate the restoration process with public reference models of large-scale power systems. The experimental results show that our method improves the total restored energy up to 57.6% and reduces the recovery time up to 63% by considering the power-communication interdependency.","IEEE","","Argonne National Lab.

With coordinated management of each inverter in the system, the control system commands the power plant to proactively curtail a small fraction of its instantaneous maximum power potential, which gives the plant enough headroom to ramp up production from the overall power plant, for a service such as regulation reserve. This control system is practical for continuously changing cloud cover conditions in partially cloudy days. A case study from a site in Hawaii with one-second resolution solar irradiance data is used to verify the efficacy of the proposed control system. The proposed control algorithm is subsequently compared with the alternative control technology from the literature, the grouping control algorithm; the results show that the proposed hierarchical control system is over 10 times more effective in reducing generator mileage to support power fluctuations from solar PV power plants.","IEEE","","National Renewable Energy Lab.

"DC microgrid fault detection using multiresolution analysis of traveling waves","Montoya, Rudy; Poudel, Binod P.; Bidram, Ali; Reno, Matthew J.","24 POWER TRANSMISSION AND DISTRIBUTION; DC microgrids; fault location; multilevel resolution analysis; traveling waves","Fast detection and isolation of faults in a DC microgrid is of particular importance. Fast tripping protection (i) increases the lifetime of power electronics (PE) switches by avoiding high fault current magnitudes and (ii) enhances the controllability of PE converters. This paper proposes a traveling wave (TW) based scheme for fast tripping protection of DC microgrids. The proposed scheme utilizes a discrete wavelet transform (DWT) to calculate the high-frequency components of DC fault currents. Multiresolution analysis (MRA) using DWT is utilized to detect TW components for different frequency ranges. The Parseval energy of the MRA coefficients are then calculated to demonstrate a quantitative relationship between the fault current signal energy and coefficients’ energy. The calculated Parseval energy values are used to train a Support Vector Machine classifier to identify the fault type and a Gaussian Process regression engine to estimate the fault location on the DC cables. The proposed approach is verified by simulating two microgrid test systems in PSCAD/EMTDC.","Elsevier","","Sandia National Lab.

This paper identifies specific end-use cases for which DC distribution in buildings is viable today. We evaluate their technology and market readiness, as well as their efficiency, cost, and resiliency benefits while addressing implementation barriers. The paper starts with a technology review, followed by a comprehensive market assessment, in which we analyze DC distribution field deployments and their end-use characteristics. We also conduct a survey of DC power and building professionals through on-site visits and phone interviews and summarize lessons learned and recommendations. In addition, the paper includes a novel efficiency analysis, in which we quantify energy savings from DC distribution for different end-use categories.

The SST features medium-frequency isolation, full controllability for voltage regulation, reactive power compensation, and the capability of battery energy storage system (BESS) integration with multiport configuration. The HT has a partially-rated converter for fractional controllability and can integrate a small BESS. Fast grid-edge voltage fluctuations from increased solar photovoltaic (PV) and electric vehicle (EV) penetration are difficult to manage for mechanical load tap changers. Hence, along with the trend towards more BESS in the grid, the controllability and the storage integration capability of the SST and HT are of strong interest. However, a review of literature shows existing SST and HT research is mostly at converter level, while system-level assessments are scarce. Assessing technical and economic impacts is critical to understanding the benefits and role of the SST and HT to guide future research, which is presented for the first time in this article. Experimental results from medium-voltage (MV) SST and MV HT prototypes are shown to confirm equipment-level feasibility, where the voltage controllability waveforms of a MV HT prototype are reported for the first time. Comparative simulations are performed on a modified IEEE 34-bus system. Here, a grid-model-less decentralized grid-edge voltage control method and a day-ahead BESS dispatch method are proposed for the SST and HT. The simulations show that the SST and HT with integrated storage can host more PV, achieve peak shaving, mitigate voltage fluctuation and reverse power flow, and support energy arbitrage for operational cost reduction, as compared to the LFT. Moreover, comprehensive analyses of net present value (NPV) and internal rate of return (IRR) are performed under different installed PV capacities, HT’s partial converter ratings, and BESS capacities. Sensitivities to future cost reductions of the PV and BESS are studied. Although the NPV and IRR are currently negative, 60% capital cost reduction or 150% revenue increase will make the SST and HT economically viable in the use case studied.","IEEE","","Georgia Institute of Technology, Atlanta, GA (United States)","USDOE Advanced Research Projects Agency - Energy (ARPA-E)","","United States","2022-01-18T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: IEEE Journal of Emerging and Selected Topics in Power Electronics; Journal Volume: 10; Journal Issue: 4","","Medium: ED; Size: p. 3771-3787","","","AR0000899","Journal ID: ISSN 2168-6777","10.1109/jestpe.2022.3144361","","2023-01-18T00:00:00Z","1892475","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/1892475","https://www.osti.gov/servlets/purl/1892475","IEEE Journal of Emerging and Selected Topics in Power Electronics","4","10"

Energy needs of electric trucks will likely require megawatt-scale charging stations, which could significantly stress the electric distribution grid. Distributed energy resources (DER) can alleviate this stress and reduce charging costs with proper management. To that end, this work develops a hierarchical predictive control algorithm for future multi-port megawatt-scale charging stations that can provide real-time energy management for stations, decide charging rates, dispatch energy storage system (ESS), and provide grid voltage support. We integrate three algorithmic components: (i) an energy management optimization (EMO) that provides supervisory control to DER assets and charging loads at minute scale, (ii) a real-time energy management system (RT-EMS) that heuristically compensates for fast disturbances at sub-second scale, and (iii) a model predictive control (MPC)-based battery management system (BMS) that communicates future charging demands to the EMO, to manage the overall megawatt-scale site. Additionally, validation in a controller hardware-in-the-loop (CHIL) environment shows that the hierarchical controller can reduce the total energy consumption from the grid by approximately 28% compared to an uncontrolled case for the station configuration in this paper, without impacting charging time.","IEEE","","National Renewable Energy Lab.

"Distributed Frequency Divider for Power System Bus Frequency Online Estimation Considering Virtual Inertia From DFIGs","Tan, Bendong; Zhao, Junbo; Duan, Nan; Maldonado, Daniel Adrian; Zhang, Yingchen; Zhang, Hongming; Anitescu, Mihai","24 POWER TRANSMISSION AND DISTRIBUTION; distributed frequency divider formula; double-fed induction generator; frequency estimation; inertia emulation; Thevenin equivalent","In this work, a distributed frequency divider is proposed to estimate power system bus frequency with a limited number of PMUs while considering the inertial contributions from double-fed induction generators (DFIGs). The key idea is to reformulate the original frequency divider by modeling the contributions of DFIGs with inertia emulation and external regional power system through Thevenin equivalents. The distributed frequency divider is general and able to estimate local bus frequencies in a distributed manner. Besides, only the knowledge of the rotor speeds of synchronous generator, boundary bus frequencies and terminal bus frequencies of DFIGs as well as the admittance matrix are required to estimate the frequencies at all buses. This is drastically different from existing approaches that require system observability by PMUs to monitor all bus frequencies. Numerical results carried out on the IEEE 39-bus and modified 118-bus power systems with DFIGs demonstrate and effectiveness and robustness of the proposed method.","IEEE","External Audience (Unlimited)","Lawrence Livermore National Lab.

"Feedback Power Cost Optimization in Power Distribution Networks with Prosumers","Cavraro, Guido; Bernstein, Andrey; Carli, Ruggero; Zampieri, Sandro","24 POWER TRANSMISSION AND DISTRIBUTION; distributed control; optimal power flow; prosumers","Here, we propose a feedback control approach for solving optimal power flow (OPF) problems in power distribution networks (DNs) based on a projected gradient scheme, where the cost is given by the sum of functions of local power injections. This approach does not require detailed knowledge of the grid model and enables real-time tracking of the optimal generation configuration. Moreover, the communication burden is minimal: only a broadcast from a central entity, called the Network Supervisor (NS), to the agents in the network is needed. Hence, agents do not have to share local information that can be sensitive, e.g., their power injections or the value of the local costs. Our approach is then used to solve a particular OPF problem targeting DNs with high penetration of distributed energy resources (DERs) in which the energy cost is given by the remuneration that the DERs owners receive for the service they provide.","IEEE","","National Renewable Energy Lab.

"Large balancing areas and dispersed renewable investment enhance grid flexibility in a renewable-dominant power system in China","Lin, Jiang; Abhyankar, Nikit; He, Gang; Liu, Xu; Yin, Shengfei","24 POWER TRANSMISSION AND DISTRIBUTION; energy policy; power structure","Renewable energy is poised to play a major role in achieving China's carbon neutrality goal by 2060; however, reliability and flexibility is a big concern of a renewable-dominant power system. Various strategies of enhancing flexibility are under discussion to ensure the reliability of such a system, but no detailed quantitative analysis has been reported yet in China. We combine the advantages of a capacity expansion model, SWITCH-China, with a production simulation model, PLEXOS, and analyze flexibility options under different scenarios of a renewable-dominant power system in China. We find that a larger balancing area offers direct flexibility benefits. Regional balancing could reduce the renewable curtailment rate by 5-7%, compared with a provincial balancing strategy. National balancing could further reduce the power cost by about 16%. However, retrofitting coal power plants for flexible operation would only improve the system flexibility marginally.","Elsevier","","Lawrence Berkeley National Lab.

This is because most utilities do not have secondary low-voltage system models that connect service transformers and residential customers. This is important because in many cases the main impact of interconnecting DERs could occur on the low-voltage distribution systems. This paper proposes a supervised learning method to approximate local secondary models to improve the interconnection process. The proposed supervised learning method includes a decision tree model that predicts the secondary topology and a logistic regression model that predicts conductor types. The case studies demonstrate the benefits of including secondary low-voltage circuits in the interconnection process. We report the proposed modeling methodology is readily scalable and thus can reduce the cost and effort of PV interconnection for the industry and stakeholders.","IEEE","","National Renewable Energy Lab.

We propose a quadratically constrained linear program formulation for the ROA characterization problem. In addition, we formulate a second-order cone program for online voltage stability monitoring and control exploiting the proposed ROA characterization. Finally, we demonstrate the efficacy of the proposed formulations on the ROA characterization and stability monitoring and control using a standard IEEE test system.","IEEE","","National Renewable Energy Lab.

Power grid operations increasingly interact with environmental systems and human systems such as transportation, agriculture, the economy, and financial markets. Our objective is to discuss the modelling gaps and opportunities to advance the science for multisector adaptation and tradeoffs. We focus on power system operational models, which typically represent key physical and economic aspects of grid operations over days to a year and assume a fixed power grid infrastructure. Due to computational burden, models are typically customized to reflect regional resource opportunities, data availability, and applications of interest. We conceptualize power system operational models with four core processes: physical grid assets (generation, transmission, loads, and storage), model objectives and purpose, institutions and decision agents, and performance metrics. We taxonomize the representations of these core processes based on a review of 23 existing models. Using science questions around grid and short term uncertainties, long term global change, and multisectoral technological innovation as examples, we report on tradeoffs in process fidelity and tractability that have been adopted by the research community to represent multisectoral interactions in power system operational models. Overall, our recommendations for research directions are model-agnostic, focusing on core processes, their interactions with other human systems, and consider computational tradeoffs.","Elsevier","","Pacific Northwest National Lab.

"Designing resilient decentralized energy systems: The importance of modeling extreme events and long-duration power outages","Hanna, Ryan; Marqusee, Jeffrey","24 POWER TRANSMISSION AND DISTRIBUTION; energy policy; energy resources; energy systems","Mitigating and adapting to climate change requires decarbonizing electricity while ensuring resilience of supply, since a warming planet will lead to greater extremes in weather and, plausibly, in power outages. Although it is well known that long-duration outages severely impact economies, such outages are usually not well characterized or modeled in grid infrastructure planning tools. Here, we bring together data and modeling techniques and show how they can be used to characterize and model long-duration outages. We illustrate how to integrate outages in planning tools for one promising mode of resilient energy supply—microgrids. Failing to treat these extremes in models can lead to microgrid designs (1) that do not realize their full value of resilience, since models do not see the benefits of protecting against extremes, and (2) that appear reliable on paper yet do not actually protect against extremes. Although utilities record power interruptions, lack of access to that data is hindering research on resilience; making datasets available publicly would substantially aid efforts to improve grid planning tools.","Elsevier","","National Renewable Energy Lab.

Voltage and reactive power (Volt/VAr), and voltage and active power (Volt/Watt) dynamics have been analyzed at slower time scales akin to the control of legacy grid devices. However, smart inverters, being power-electronics based devices, can provide dynamic active/reactive power support at a faster time scale, which necessitates Volt/VAr and Volt/Watt dynamics to be analyzed at a faster time scale. The existing dynamic models are overly detailed and computationally intractable for distribution feeders with a large number of inverters. In this context, this proposed work aims towards developing a computationally tractable, scalable, and accurate phasor-based model for dynamic Volt/VAr and Volt/Watt analyses of large distribution systems with high penetration of smart inverters. Case studies demonstrate that the proposed phasor-based model sufficiently captures the Volt/VAr and Volt/Watt dynamics, and is computationally faster by one order of magnitude compared to the average model and by two orders of magnitude compared to the detailed switching model. Case studies also demonstrate the efficacy and scalability of the proposed model in analyzing Volt/VAr and Volt/Watt dynamics of large-scale power networks with hundreds of SIs.","IEEE","","National Renewable Energy Lab.

New challenges introduced by high penetration of DERs range from poor observability to overload and reverse power flow problems, under-over-voltages, maloperation of legacy protection systems, and requirements for new planning procedures. Distribution utility personnel are not adequately trained, and legacy control centers are not properly equipped to cope with these issues. Fortunately, distribution energy resource management systems (DERMSs) are emerging software technologies aimed to provide distribution system operators (DSOs) with a specialized set of tools to enable them to overcome the issues caused by DERs and to maximize the benefits of the presence of high penetration of these novel resources. However, as DERMS technology is still emerging, its definition is vague and can refer to very different levels of software hierarchies, spanning from decentralized virtual power plants to DER aggregators and fully centralized enterprise systems (called utility DERMS). Although they are all frequently simply called DERMS, these software technologies have different sets of tools and aim to provide different services to different stakeholders. This paper explores how these different software technologies can complement each other, and how they can provide significant benefits to DSOs in enabling them to successfully manage evolving distribution networks with high penetration of DERs when they are integrated together into the control centers of distribution utilities.","Springer","","National Renewable Energy Lab.

Adequate distribution grid planning that properly captures the risk aversion of the utility system planner is a key factor to increase the flexibility of distribution networks to circumvent these events. In this paper, we propose a methodology to determine the optimal portfolio of investments in lines and storage devices in order to minimize a convex combination between expected value and CVaR of operational costs, including energy not served, while taking into account the multistage nature of the energy storage management within this context. While the expected value of energy not served has been traditionally employed to tackle routine failures, we also minimize the CVaR of energy not served to address high-impact, low-probability (HILP) events. We illustrate the performance of the proposed methodology with a 54-Bus system test case.","MDPI","","Lawrence Berkeley National Lab.

Energy storage can enable dispatchable renewables, but only with drastic cost reductions compared to current battery technologies.

Furthermore, this paper reports the first containment of silicon in a multipart graphite tank above 2000°C, using material grades that are affordable for energy storage at GWh scales. Low cost molded graphite with particle sizes as large as 10 μm successfully contained metallurgical grade silicon, even with as much as two-thirds iron by mass for up to 10 hours and temperatures as high as 2300°C, in tanks as large as two gallons.","Elsevier","","Massachusetts Inst. of Technology (MIT), Cambridge, MA (United States)","USDOE Advanced Research Projects Agency - Energy (ARPA-E); USDOE Office of Energy Efficiency and Renewable Energy (EERE)","","United States","2021-12-11T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: Applied Energy; Journal Volume: 308","","Medium: ED; Size: Article No. 118081","","","EE0008381; AR0001005; EE0008375","Journal ID: ISSN 0306-2619","10.1016/j.apenergy.2021.118081","","2022-12-12T00:00:00Z","1879109","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/1879109","https://www.osti.gov/servlets/purl/1879109","Applied Energy","","308"

"Optimal operational controls for power grid","Wang, Hong; Yang, Fuwen","24 POWER TRANSMISSION AND DISTRIBUTION","Power grid operation is facing increased penetration of renewables and distributed energy resources at both transmission and distribution levels. This presents an increased level of randomness and uncertainty for its operational quality, where the challenges are mainly how controls and optimizations can be performed so that the operational quality of the power grid can be maintained. An interesting feature is also that we need to make a good use of uncertainties embedded in the swing equation from the renewable contributions rather than simply trying to minimize the impact of uncertainties. Furthermore, this requires effective solutions on system estimation, control, and optimization. Indeed, in past decades, work has been carried out on the development of advanced controls and optimization for such complicated dynamic systems. Examples are optimal operational control for both performance and stability enhancement considering random renewables penetration, frequency, and active power control for microgrids and parameter estimation for various parts of the power grid.","Wiley","","Oak Ridge National Lab.

"The Effects of Climate Change on Interregional Electricity Market Dynamics on the U.S. West Coast","Hill, Joy; Kern, Jordan; Rupp, David E.; Voisin, Nathalie; Characklis, Gregory","24 POWER TRANSMISSION AND DISTRIBUTION; 29 ENERGY PLANNING, POLICY, AND ECONOMY; 54 ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCES","The United States (U.S.) West Coast power system is strongly influenced by variability and extremes in air temperatures (which drive electricity demand) and streamflows (which constrain hydropower production). As hydroclimate changes across the West Coast, a combination of forces may work in tandem to make its bulk power system more vulnerable to physical reliability issues and market price shocks. In particular, a warmer climate is expected to increase summer cooling (electricity) demands and shift the average timing of peak streamflow (hydropower production) away from summer to the spring and winter, depriving power systems of hydropower when it is needed the most. Here, we investigate how climate change could alter interregional electricity market dynamics on the West Coast, including the potential for hydroclimatic changes in one region (e.g. Pacific Northwest (PNW)) to “spill over” and cause price and reliability risks in another (e.g. California). We find that the most salient hydroclimatic risks for the PNW power system are changes in streamflow, while risks for the California system are driven primarily by changes in summer air temperatures, especially extreme heat events that increase peak system demand. Altered timing and amounts of hydropower production in the PNW do alter summer power deliveries into California but show relatively modest potential to impact prices and reliability there. Instead, it is future climate conditions (extreme heat) in California that may exert a stronger significant influence on prices and reliability in the PNW, especially if California continues to rely on its northern neighbor for imported power to meet higher summer demands.","American Geophysical Union (AGU)","","Pacific Northwest National Lab.

"Dynamic <em>P-Q</em> Capability and Abnormal Operation Analysis of a Wind Turbine with Doubly-Fed Induction Generator","Lu, Bing; Li, Shuhui; Das, Himadry Shekhar; Gao, Yixiang; Wang, Jing; Baggu, Murali","17 WIND ENERGY; 24 POWER TRANSMISSION AND DISTRIBUTION; doubly-fed induction generator; P-Q capability charts; subsynchronous oscillation; vector control; wind power","After several accidents occurred in wind farms in the United States and around the world, the subsynchronous oscillation (SSO) issues in grid-connected wind farms have gained serious attention. Particularly, these issues have caused significant challenges to wind turbines with a doubly fed induction generator (DFIG) because it is connected to the grid via both its stator and rotor paths. Traditionally, a P-Q capability chart is utilized to assure the safe operation boundary for a synchronous generator. But the energy conversion characteristics of a DFIG wind turbine are completely different. A critical factor to affect the reliable operation of a DFIG wind turbine is the rated current and pulse-width modulation (PWM) saturation constraints of its power converters. These constraint conditions can be affected by the wind turbine rotating speed and grid conditions. However, a detailed study of DFIG P-Q capability from these perspectives has not been conducted, which has hindered adequate understanding of many abnormal wind turbine operations reported in the literature and the development of advanced control technologies to overcome the challenges. The proposed study in this paper considers vector control implementation to DFIG power electronic converters in the dq reference frame, and the models and algorithms developed for the P-Q capability study have addressed specific DFIG power converter constraints that are different from those of a traditional synchronous generator. The paper especially focuses on exploring the dynamic natures of DFIG P-Q capability under uncertain and variable conditions to explore the root causes of many abnormal operations of DFIG wind turbines reported in the literature. The proposed study is validated through an electromagnetic transient simulation model of a grid-connected DFIG wind turbine. The proposed study has the potential to lead to the development of new DFIG control technologies that can help overcome the challenges for many abnormal operations of DFIG wind turbines.","IEEE","","National Renewable Energy Lab.

"Optimal Energy Scheduling and Sensitivity Analysis for Integrated Power-Water-Heat Systems","Fang, Sidun; Wang, Chenxu; Lin, Yashen; Zhao, Changhong","24 POWER TRANSMISSION AND DISTRIBUTION; decomposed optimization; district heating; municipal water; power distribution; sensitivity analysis","The conventionally independent power, water, and heating networks are becoming more tightly connected, which motivates their joint optimal energy scheduling to improve the overall efficiency of an integrated energy system. However, such a joint optimization is known as a challenging problem with complex network constraints and couplings of electric, hydraulic, and thermal models that are nonlinear and nonconvex. We formulate an optimal power-water-heat flow (OPWHF) problem and develop a computationally efficient heuristic to solve it. The proposed heuristic decomposes OPWHF into subproblems, which are iteratively solved via convex relaxation and convex-concave procedure. Simulation results validate that the proposed framework can improve operational flexibility and social welfare of the integrated system, wherein the water and heating networks respond as virtual energy storage to time-varying energy prices and solar photovoltaic generation. Moreover, we perform sensitivity analysis to compare two modes of heating network control: by flow rate and by temperature. Our results reveal that the latter is more effective for heating networks with a wider space of pipeline parameters.","IEEE","","National Renewable Energy Lab.

The results indicate that the cost of electrical transmission per delivered MWh can be up to eight times higher than for hydrogen pipelines, about eleven times higher than for natural gas pipelines, and twenty to fifty times higher than for liquid fuels pipelines. These differences generally hold for shorter distances as well. The higher cost of electrical transmission is primarily because of lower carrying capacity (MW per line) of electrical transmission lines compared to the energy carrying capacity of the pipelines for gaseous and liquid fuels. The differences in the cost of transmission are important but often unrecognized and should be considered as a significant cost component in the analysis of various renewable energy production, distribution, and utilization scenarios.","Elsevier","","National Renewable Energy Lab.

For the current dispatch model, the demand is assumed to be constant within a time interval, while the intra-interval power balance is left to frequency regulation. Based on practical experience and simulations, this behavior may lead to insufficient frequency regulation and uneconomic regulation costs considering the increase in intra-interval fluctuations caused by renewables. Here, a real-time dispatch method with secondary frequency regulation behaviors is proposed. Without changing the interval of the real-time dispatch command, the system regulation mileage and intra-interval generation adjustment are explicitly formulated in a mixed-integer optimization model. To reduce the computational burden, an efficient two-stage calculation method is proposed. With practical utility data, this article finds that the proposed method can effectively improve the system frequency performance with the subminute net load forecasting curve obtained by an off-the-shelf forecasting approach. Time-domain simulations in IEEE and practical utility systems validate the effectiveness of the proposed method in terms of the frequency performance and total operating costs.","IEEE","","National Renewable Energy Lab.

Accurate detection of such a highly-deceptive attack is a challenging task especially when the spoofing attack happens on short fragments of DS recorded within a relatively small geographical scale. Herein this letter proposes an effective approach to detect this cyber-attack by realizing the multifractal characteristics of DS measurements. First, the multifractal cross-correlation of DS measured at multiple intra-state locations is revealed. Then the derived correlation is integrated with weighted two-dimensional multifractal surface interpolation to reconstruct quasi high-resolution signals. Finally, informative location-specific signatures are extracted from the high-resolution DS and they are integrated with advanced machine learning techniques for source authentication.

Thus, there is an imperative need to enhance grid emergency control to maintain system reliability and security. Towards this end, great progress has been made in developing deep reinforcement learning (DRL) based grid control solutions in recent years. However, existing DRL-based solutions have two main limitations: 1) they cannot handle well with a wide range of grid operation conditions, system parameters, and contingencies; 2) they generally lack the ability to fast adapt to new grid operation conditions, system parameters, and contingencies, limiting their applicability for real-world applications. Here, in this paper, we mitigate these limitations by developing a novel deep meta-reinforcement learning (DMRL) algorithm. The DMRL combines the meta strategy optimization together with DRL, and trains policies modulated by a latent space that can quickly adapt to new scenarios. We test the developed DMRL algorithm on the IEEE 300-bus system. We demonstrate fast adaptation of the meta-trained DRL polices with latent variables to new operating conditions and scenarios using the proposed method, which achieves superior performance compared to the state-of-the-art DRL and model predictive control (MPC) methods.","IEEE","","Pacific Northwest National Lab.

"Multisource Data Fusion Outage Location in Distribution Systems via Probabilistic Graphical Models","Yuan, Yuxuan; Dehghanpour, Kaveh; Wang, Zhaoyu; Bu, Fankun","24 POWER TRANSMISSION AND DISTRIBUTION; Approximate inference; Bayesian networks; data fusion; outage location; partially observable distribution system","Efficient outage location is critical to enhancing the resilience of power distribution systems. However, accurate outage location requires combining massive evidence received from diverse data sources, including smart meter (SM) last gasp signals, customer trouble calls, social media messages, weather data, vegetation information, and physical parameters of the network. This is a computationally complex task due to the high dimensionality of data in distribution grids. In this paper, we propose a multi-source data fusion approach to locate outage events in partially observable distribution systems using Bayesian networks (BNs). A novel aspect of the proposed approach is that it takes multi-source evidence and the complex structure of distribution systems into account using a probabilistic graphical method. Our method can radically reduce the computational complexity of outage location inference in high-dimensional spaces. The graphical structure of the proposed BN is established based on the network’s topology and the causal relationship between random variables, such as the states of branches/customers and evidence. Utilizing this graphical model, accurate outage locations are obtained by leveraging a Gibbs sampling (GS) method, to infer the probabilities of de-energization for all branches. Compared with commonly-used exact inference methods that have exponential complexity in the size of the BN, GS quantifies the target conditional probability distributions in a timely manner. As a result, a case study of several real-world distribution systems is presented to validate the proposed method.","IEEE","","Iowa State Univ., Ames, IA (United States)","USDOE Office of Electricity (OE)","","United States","2021-11-17T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: IEEE Transactions on Smart Grid; Journal Volume: 13; Journal Issue: 2","","Medium: ED; Size: p. 1357-1371","","","OE0000875","Journal ID: ISSN 1949-3053","10.1109/tsg.2021.3128752","","2023-03-17T00:00:00Z","1961215","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/1961215","https://www.osti.gov/servlets/purl/1961215","IEEE Transactions on Smart Grid","2","13"

However, the large number of decision variables, especially the binary ones for reconfiguration, bring challenges to developing scalable distributed distribution service restoration (DDSR) strategies. This paper proposes a fully distributed solution procedure based on the alternating direction method of multipliers (ADMM) for mixed-integer programming problems and applies to develop the DDSR framework. The method consists of relax-drive-polish phases, 1) relaxing binary variables, and applying the convex ADMM as a warm start; 2) driving the solutions toward Boolean values through a proximal operator; 3) fixing the obtained binding binary variables and solving the rest of the problem to polish results and achieve a high-quality suboptimal solution. Then, an autonomous clustering strategy and consensus ADMM are integrated with the proposed method to realize the fully distributed cluster-based framework of DDSR. This framework can first determine DER scheduling and switch status for reconfiguration to energize the out-of-service areas from local faults, and then provide the load restoration solution in a distributed manner for total blackouts in large-scale distribution networks. Furthermore, the effectiveness and scalability of the proposed DDSR framework are demonstrated through testing on the IEEE 123-node, IEEE 8500-node, and synthetic 100k-node test feeders.","IEEE","","Univ. of Central Florida, Orlando, FL (United States)","USDOE Office of Energy Efficiency and Renewable Energy (EERE), Renewable Power Office.

Copies of modules share the centralized load bus and interact with an MV ac grid in parallel. Hybrid power port (HPO) assigns flexibility to the system but makes energy routings a necessity for stable operation. In this article, a segmented energy management strategy for the HPO-ER is proposed. In terms of the grid-side power transferring, the system ratings are intentionally designed to match significant power imbalance. Focally, a segmented energy management strategy is proposed to realize fully autonomous energy routing involving MV ac grid, distributed PV generations, distributed battery storages, and LV load. The system is proven to be stable using the derived impedance-based model considering the interaction between power blocks. The feasibility of the topology and control strategy is also verified through software simulation, laboratorial hardware prototype experiment, and hardware-in-the-loop (HIL) emulation.","IEEE","","Oak Ridge National Lab.

"Real-time Optimal Dispatch of Behind-the-Meter DERs for Secondary Frequency Regulation","Thapa, Jitendra; MansourLakouraj, Mohammad; Gautam, Mukesh; Abdelmalak, Michael; Benidris, Mohammed; Livani, Hanif","24 POWER TRANSMISSION AND DISTRIBUTION; active distribution networks; distributed energy resources; linearized power flow; secondary frequency","Active distribution networks (ADNs) can provide grid services such as peak load shaving, loss reduction, VoltNar control, congestion management, and frequency regulation. The fast response of inverter-based distributed energy resources (DERs) and battery storage systems enables them to provide ramping support and frequency control. This paper proposes a real-time optimization approach for behind-the-meter DERs to participate in the secondary frequency regulation. The proposed approach determines optimal set-points of output power of DERs to respond to requests from system operators (SOs) in realtime to maintain the frequency of the system at the nominal value. To satisfy the real-time requirement for the secondary frequency control, the nonlinear AC power flow model is linearized considering power losses in the system to achieve both high computational speed and acceptable accuracy. The optimization problem is rerun in a closed loop manner until the mismatch between the requested power by the system operators and actual delivered power at the substation reaches an acceptable tolerance. Furthermore, the proposed approach is validated using modified versions of the IEEE 33-bus and IEEE 69-bus distribution systems. Although the contribution of a single distribution system in the frequency regulation may not be significant, stacked and coordinated contributions from several distribution systems can provide frequency regulation and other grid services at scale.","IEEE","","NV Energy, Inc., Las Vegas, NV (United States)","USDOE Office of Energy Efficiency and Renewable Energy (EERE)","","United States","2021-11-14T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: Proceedings of the Annual North American Power Symposium; Journal Volume: 2021","","Medium: ED","","","EE0009022","Journal ID: ISSN 0895-4097","10.1109/naps52732.2021.9654461","","2022-11-21T00:00:00Z","1894505","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/1894505","https://www.osti.gov/servlets/purl/1894505","Proceedings of the Annual North American Power Symposium","","2021"

Numerous published studies about MAS discuss its utilization in power distribution networks but none focuses on the prior step to restoration and self-healing that is fault section estimation. This paper aims to show how MAS can improve the utilities’ reliability indexes and consumer satisfaction by overcoming the multiple fault section estimation problem. In order to do this, the authors considered using MAS as a means of communication between smart meters. The purpose of smart meters usage is to employ devices that are already present in smart grids, mainly because of their reading and saving data capacity. The proposed method was tested on a radial feeder generated by the authors. The network was built on HYPERSIM, a software platform of OPAL-RT Technologies. The simulation results show that this MAS provides speed, efficiency, and automation for the process of fault section estimation.","Elsevier","","Pacific Northwest National Lab.

However, the operators of a distribution system and microgrids therein can be different and have accessibility to different devices. To model the operation of such a grid, this work proposes a bilevel formulation and probes into the voltage regulation operation, considering the interaction between different systems. The proposed bilevel formulation considers the cooperation of active energy resources (AER), transformer tap-changers, and capacitor banks that are controlled by different operators. To facilitate the solution time of the target bilevel optimization, the lower-level problems with different objectives are modeled using deep neural networks (DNNs) which are then converted into a set of constraints. Hence, the bilevel problem can be reformed to a single-level problem. Lastly, the proposed solution procedures are validated using a customized joint system constructed by the IEEE 123-bus system and a real distribution system in Iowa. According to the numerical validation results, the solution time of the proposed nonlinear activation function based DNN model is 69 times faster than other methods in solving voltage regulation with a bilevel structure.","IEEE","","Argonne National Lab.

In this article, two challenges in existing insulation coordination designs for grid-connected SSTs are identified. One challenge is the mismatch between metal-oxide varistor (MOV) protective levels and SST insulation strength, the other challenge is the incompatibility of standard impulse test on SST protective structures. To address the MOV selection challenge, a novel lightning protection scheme is designed to protect a single-stage SST where the semiconductor modules are directly exposed to external lightning impulses. Here, the in-lab lightning impulse tests are performed to verify the overvoltage attenuation performance of the prototyped lightning protection scheme. To address the impulse test challenge, the surge withstand capability of the protected SST is comprehensively evaluated with a complete set of insulation coordination design procedures beyond the basic insulation level (BIL) test. After these two challenges are addressed, a discussion is presented on substituting conventional transformers with the protected SSTs into insulation-coordinated distribution systems to facilitate the field deployment of SSTs.","IEEE","","Georgia Institute of Technology, Atlanta, GA (United States)","USDOE Advanced Research Projects Agency - Energy (ARPA-E)","","United States","2021-11-08T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: IEEE Journal of Emerging and Selected Topics in Power Electronics; Journal Volume: 10; Journal Issue: 4","","Medium: ED; Size: p. 3746-3758","","","AR0000899","Journal ID: ISSN 2168-6777","10.1109/jestpe.2021.3125708","","2022-11-08T00:00:00Z","1892478","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/1892478","https://www.osti.gov/servlets/purl/1892478","IEEE Journal of Emerging and Selected Topics in Power Electronics","4","10"

Most existing DC network optimal power flow (DN-OPF) formulations assume exact knowledge of loading conditions and do not provide stability guarantees. Here, in contrast, this paper studies a DN-OPF formulation which considers both stability and operational constraint satisfaction under uncertainty. The need to account for a range of uncertainty realizations in this paper's robust optimization formulation results in a challenging semi-infinite program (SIP). The proposed solution algorithm reformulates this SIP into a computationally tractable problem by constructing a tight convex inner approximation of the stability set using sufficient conditions for the existence of a feasible and stable power flow solution. Optimal generator set-points are obtained by optimizing over the proposed convex stability set. The validity and effectiveness of the propose algorithm is demonstrated through various DC networks adapted from IEEE test cases.","IEEE","","National Renewable Energy Lab.

Based on a microgrid implementation in California, in this study we investigate microgrid operation under real-world conditions. These conditions have not yet been considered in combination and encompass energy charges, demand charges, export limits, as well as uncertainty about future electricity demand and generation in the microgrid. Under these conditions, we evaluate the performance of two frequently applied groups of strategies for microgrid operation. The first group is composed of proactive strategies that optimize decisions based on forecasts of future electricity generation and demand. The second group includes reactive strategies that make operational decisions based exclusively on the current state of the microgrid. We evaluate the performance of the strategies under varying operational parameters, forecast accuracies, and microgrid configurations—well beyond our Californian showcase. Our results confirm the expectation that proactive strategies outperform reactive ones in the majority of settings. Yet, reactive strategies can perform better under short control intervals or under moderate prediction errors of PV generation or demand. Furthermore, the interplay between real-world conditions and operational strategies reveals several additional insights for research on microgrid operation. First, we find that demand charges and export limits decisively affect microgrid performance. Second, the impact of forecast errors is highly non-linear and non-monotonous. Third, escalating negative interactions between forecast errors and demand charges make proactive strategies benefit from longer control intervals. This result is contrary to existing best practice, which promotes short control intervals to minimize the impact of uncertainty.","Elsevier","","Lawrence Berkeley National Lab.

Their strategic placement is of ultimate importance because it is not economically viable to install measurement systems on every node and branch of a power grid, though they need to be monitored. An overwhelming number of strategies have been developed to meet oftentimes multiple conflicting objectives. The prime challenge in formulating the problem lies in developing a heuristic or an optimisation model that, though mathematically tractable and constrained in cost, leads to trustworthy technical solutions. Further, large-scale, long-term deployments pose additional challenges because the boundary conditions change as technologies evolve. For instance, the advent of new technologies in sensing and measurement, as well as in communications and networking, might impact the cost and performance of available solutions and shift initially set conditions. Also, the placement strategies developed for transmission grids might not be suitable for distribution grids, and vice versa, because of unique characteristics; therefore, the strategies need to be flexible, to a certain extent, because no two power grids are alike. Despite the extensive literature on the present topic, the focus of published works tends to be on a specific subject, such as the optimal placement of measurements to ensure observability in transmission grids. There is a dearth of work providing a comprehensive picture for developing optimal placement strategies. Because of the ongoing efforts on the modernisation of electric power grids, there is a need to consolidate the status quo while exposing its limitations to inform policymakers, industry stakeholders, and researchers on the research-and-development needs to push the boundaries for innovation. Accordingly, this paper first reviews the state-of-the-art considering both transmission and distribution grids. Then, it consolidates the key factors to be considered in the problem formulation. Finally, it provides a set of perspectives on the measurement placement problem, and it concludes with future research directions.","Institution of Engineering and Technology","","National Renewable Energy Lab.

Under a combination of these two drivers, capacity investments in renewable technologies triple, whereas investments in fossil capacity (coal, gas, and refined liquids) substantially reduce. The high renewable capacity investment is characterized by high investment in solar technologies for peak power demand and shifts from coal and gas technologies into gas and wind power for baseload demand.

The hierarchical control framework consists of a utility controller, community aggregators and multiple home energy management systems. The flexibility of the DERs is evaluated by each controller in the hierarchy such that the resultant flexibility is feasible given its operational domain. Based on the determined flexibility, the hierarchical controllers then compute optimal setpoints for the DERs to help the distribution system regulate node voltages and provide other distribution grid services.

DERs have the ability to provide frequency regulation services; however, existing frequency dynamic simulation tools - which were developed mainly for the transmission system - lack the capability to simulate distribution network dynamics with high penetrations of DERs. Although electromagnetic transient simulation tools can simulate distribution network dynamics, the computation efficiency limits their use for large-scale transmission-and-distribution (T&D) co-simulation. This paper presents an efficient open-source T&D dynamic co-simulation framework for DER frequency response based on the HELICS platform and off-the-shelf T&D simulators. The challenge of synchronizing the simulation time between the transmission network and the DERs in the distribution network is solved through the detailed modeling of DERs in frequency dynamic models while DER power flow models are also preserved in the distribution networks, thereby respecting local voltage constraints when dispatching DER power for frequency response.

Such advanced ecosystems, where utility-owned and non utility-owned assets can contribute towards grid operations,generally require distributed communication and grid architectures, which can be supported by Distributed Ledger Technologies(DLTs). However, the potential of DLTs for long-term scalable solutions in operational technology applications has not been fullyutilized, partly due to the lack of standardization across and between different DLTs, as well as other supporting building blocks(e.g., communication protocols). This paper attempts to address this gap by proposing a DLT cybersecurity stack specificallydesigned for researchers, DLT technology developers, and end users (such as utilities). The DLT cybersecurity stack has beennotionally mapped to related cybersecurity components, namely: the Open Systems Interconnection (OSI) model, the TransmissionControl Protocol/Internet Protocol (TCP/IP) suite, and existing Smart Grid architecture frameworks. In addition, the paper discussesseveral cybersecurity implications, and demonstrates the potential uses of the DLT stack through multiple power and energy usecases. It is important to note that the stack can be also applied to the DLT use cases that are outside the power and energy domain.This work has been performed by the Cybersecurity Task Force under the IEEE P2418.5 Blockchain for Energy Standard workinggroup that is stationed under the IEEE Power and Energy Society’s Smart Buildings, Loads, and Customer Systems (SBLC)technical committee.","Elsevier","","Pacific Northwest National Lab.

Although crucial, due to the lack of direct monitoring devices on the switch statuses, the topology information is often unavailable or outdated for the distribution system operators for real-time applications. Apart from the limited observability of the power distribution system, other challenges are the nonlinearity of the model, the complicated, unbalanced structure of the distribution system, and the scale of the system. To overcome the above challenges, we, in this paper, propose a Bayesian-inference framework that allows us to simultaneously estimate the topology and the state of a three-phase, unbalanced power distribution system. Specifically, by using the very limited number of measurements available that are associated with the forecast load data, we efficiently recover the full Bayesian posterior distributions of the system topology under both normal and outage operation conditions. This is performed through an adaptive importance sampling procedure that greatly alleviates the computational burden of the traditional Monte-Carlo (MC)-sampling-based approach while maintaining a good estimation accuracy. The simulations conducted on the IEEE 123-bus test system and an unbalanced 1282-bus system reveal the excellent performances of the proposed method.","IEEE","External Audience (Unlimited)","Lawrence Livermore National Lab.

"Restoration Strategy for Active Distribution Systems Considering Endogenous Uncertainty in Cold Load Pickup","Li, Yujia; Sun, Wei; Yin, Wenqian; Lei, Shunbo; Hou, Yunhe","24 POWER TRANSMISSION AND DISTRIBUTION; cold load pickup; decision-dependent uncertainty; distribution system; service restoration; stochastic programming","Cold load pickup (CLPU) phenomenon is identified as the persistent power inrush upon a sudden load pickup after an outage. Under the active distribution system (ADS) paradigm, where distributed energy resources (DERs) are extensively installed, the decreased outage duration can induce a strong interdependence between CLPU pattern and load pickup decisions. In this paper, we propose a novel modelling technique to tractably capture the decision-dependent uncertainty (DDU) inherent in the CLPU process. Subsequently, a two-stage stochastic decision-dependent service restoration (SDDSR) model is constructed, where first stage searches for the optimal switching sequences to decide step-wise network topology, and the second stage optimizes the detailed generation schedule of DERs as well as the energization of switchable loads. Further, to tackle the computational burdens introduced by mixed-integer recourse, the progressive hedging algorithm (PHA) is utilized to decompose the original model into scenario-wise subproblems that can be solved in parallel. The numerical test on modified IEEE 123-node test feeders has verified the efficiency of our proposed SDDSR model and provided fresh insights into the monetary and secure values of DDU quantification.","IEEE","","Univ. of Central Florida, Orlando, FL (United States)","USDOE Office of Energy Efficiency and Renewable Energy (EERE), Renewable Power Office.

First, we present an extensive literature review in the field of integrated water and power resilience, leveraging both institutional and technical literature research landscapes. We compare various modeling approaches used to model interdependent WPS and discuss the different metrics and definitions that are typically employed to quantify and define resilience. Relevant challenges and gaps related to modeling tools and metrics are also discussed, and appropriate recommendations are made. Second, the paper presents a visualization prototype for interdependent WPS to showcase water and power system interdependencies and reveal co-managed resilience strategies that can be used to improve resilience under different types of common threats.

To preserve data privacy, in this paper we propose a differentially private projected subgradient (DP-PS) algorithm that includes a solution encryption step. We show that a sequence generated by DP-PS converges in expectation, in probability, and with probability 1. Moreover, we show that the rate of convergence in expectation is affected by a target privacy level of DP-PS chosen by the user. We conduct numerical experiments that demonstrate the convergence and data privacy preservation of DP-PS.","IEEE","","Argonne National Lab.

"Application of Mobile Energy Storage for Enhancing Power Grid Resilience: A Review","Dugan, Jesse; Mohagheghi, Salman; Kroposki, Benjamin","25 ENERGY STORAGE; 24 POWER TRANSMISSION AND DISTRIBUTION; mobile energy resources; mobile energy storage; power system resilience; resilience enhancement; service restoration","Natural disasters can lead to large-scale power outages, affecting critical infrastructure and causing social and economic damages. These events are exacerbated by climate change, which increases their frequency and magnitude. Improving power grid resilience can help mitigate the damages caused by these events. Mobile energy storage systems, classified as truck-mounted or towable battery storage systems, have recently been considered to enhance distribution grid resilience by providing localized support to critical loads during an outage. Compared to stationary batteries and other energy storage systems, their mobility provides operational flexibility to support geographically dispersed loads across an outage area. This paper provides a comprehensive and critical review of academic literature on mobile energy storage for power system resilience enhancement. As mobile energy storage is often coupled with mobile emergency generators or electric buses, those technologies are also considered in the review. Allocation of these resources for power grid resilience enhancement requires modeling of both the transportation system constraints and the power grid operational constraints. These aspects are discussed, along with a discussion on the cost–benefit analysis of mobile energy resources. The paper concludes by presenting research gaps, associated challenges, and potential future directions to address these challenges.","MDPI","","National Renewable Energy Lab.

The testing results demonstrate that the coordinated DERMS and ADMS system can effectively regulate system voltages within target operation limits using DERs. The realistic laboratory HIL testing results give utilities confidence in adopting the grid automation systems to manage DERs to achieve system-level control and operation objectives (e.g., voltage regulation).

However, such information is often unavailable, incomplete or outdated. The increasing deployment of smart meters (SMs) provides a unique opportunity to tackle this issue. This paper proposes a two-stage framework for distribution grid modeling using SM data. In the first stage, the network topology is identified by reconstructing a weighted Laplacian matrix of distribution networks. In the second stage, a least absolute deviations (LAD) regression model is developed for estimating line impedance of a single branch based on the nonlinear (inverse) power flow model, wherein a conductor library is leveraged to narrow down the solution space. The LAD regression model is originally a mixed-integer nonlinear program whose continuous relaxation is still non-convex. Furthermore, we specially address its convex relaxation and discuss the exactness. The modified regression model is then embedded within a bottom-up sweep algorithm to achieve the identification across the network in a branch-wise manner. Numerical results on the IEEE 13-bus, 37-bus and 69-bus test feeders validate the effectiveness of the proposed methods.","IEEE","","Iowa State Univ., Ames, IA (United States)","USDOE Office of Electricity (OE)","","United States","2021-10-06T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: IEEE Transactions on Power Systems; Journal Volume: 37; Journal Issue: 3","","Medium: ED; Size: p. 1995-2004","","","OE0000875","Journal ID: ISSN 0885-8950","10.1109/tpwrs.2021.3118004","","2023-03-17T00:00:00Z","1961212","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/1961212","https://www.osti.gov/servlets/purl/1961212","IEEE Transactions on Power Systems","3","37"

Given this concern, we explore the ability of concentrating-solar-power plants with thermal energy storage to provide a carbon-free source of such capacity. We develop an approach to assessing the capacity contribution of concentrating-solar-power plants that considers future systems. Such considerations are important, because of potential differences in net-load patterns compared to today (e.g., due to higher renewable-energy penetrations). Using historical data spanning an 18-year period, we demonstrate that concentrating-solar-power plants with thermal energy storage can provide this necessary capacity with little impact on their financial viability. We examine the impact of myopic decisions and imperfect foresight of future system conditions on the operation of concentrating-solar-power plants and the resultant impact on their capacity contributions. We find that imperfect foresight can have limited impacts on such a use of concentrating-solar-power plants, so long as proper forecasting techniques are developed and used. Overall, our work shows that concentrating-solar-power plants with thermal energy storage may have a role to play in delivering reliable electricity supply in a decarbonized energy system.","Elsevier","","National Renewable Energy Lab.

Here, resilience is computed as the reduction in load shed after the above-mentioned (N-2) contingencies. TS is a planned line outage, and past research shows that changing the transmission system’s topology changes the power flow and removes post contingency violations. Finding the best TS candidate in a computationally suitable time for effectively boosting resilience is a challenge. The best TS candidate is found using a novel heuristic method by decreasing the search space based on proximity to the bus with the maximum load shedding (LSB<sub>max</sub>). The LSB<sub>max</sub> algorithm is faster than existing algorithms in the literature; and, it is compatible with both the AC and DC optimal power flow formulations. To validate the authors’ claims of speedup and accuracy, two metrics are used to analyze the results from the IEEE 39-bus and 118-bus systems. Finally, the inherent parallelism of the LSB<sub>max</sub> algorithm is leveraged on a high-performance computing platform and applied to the large-scale Polish 2383-bus test system to validate scalability in both size and speedup in computation time.","Institution of Engineering and Technology (IET)","","Idaho National Lab.

"Quantitative analysis of power systems resilience: Standardization, categorizations, and challenges","Umunnakwe, A. (ORCID:0000000254117963); Huang, H.; Oikonomou, K.; Davis, K. R. (ORCID:0000000216031122)","24 POWER TRANSMISSION AND DISTRIBUTION; power system resilience metrics; resilience analysis; metric standardization; metric categorization; statistical resilience metric analysis; fragility curves; resilience quantification gaps and challenges; recommendations and future enhancement directions","Power systems incur considerable operational and infrastructural damages from high impact low probability events such as natural disasters. It therefore becomes imperative to quantify the impact of these disruptive events on power system performance so that adaptive actions can be effectively applied. This impact can be evaluated using resilience metrics which should be able to assess the transitions between the different phases in which a power system resides when subjected to an extreme event. Also, the metrics can aid in the evaluation of the effectiveness of the power system adaptive strategies. However, challenges exist since developed metrics do not proceed with a standardized framework, and due to the vast variety of existing metrics, it becomes ambiguous for researchers and power utilities to find converging information pertinent to their work. In an effort to address these challenges, this paper provides a comprehensive review of quantitative power system resilience metrics which are standardized and evaluated with diverse categorizations. The review methodology employs the Axiomatic Design Process that utilizes the axiomatic design theory and design structure matrix to decompose resilient power system functional requirements into metric design parameters. By integrating the Axiomatic Design Process, we provide a standard for comparison and analysis of the adequacy of reviewed quantitative metrics in power systems resilience quantification, while the categorizations aim to identify the specifications of these metrics. This aids in directing further studies towards resilience requirements that have received less literary attention. In addition, the paper furnishes statistical analysis of reviewed metrics in venues and years of publication by percentage, recurring resilience indicators, and power system levels/stages in which the metrics are applicable. Finally, this paper presents common requirements for resilience quantification, discusses gaps and challenges related to power system resilience metrics as well as implications posed by these challenges, while making recommendations towards filling these gaps, and posing pertinent questions to the power system resilience community.","Elsevier","","Pacific Northwest National Lab.

By optimizing the dispatch of distributed energy resources (DERs), utility grid, and demand, the proposed model is targeted to minimize total operating cost of the microgrid, including start-up and shut-down cost of distributed generators (DGs), operation and maintenance (O&M) cost of DGs, cost of buying/selling power from/to utility grid, degradation cost of energy storage systems (ESSs) and cost associated with load shedding. To capture the stochastic unintentional islanding conditions and conventional forecast errors of renewable generation and loads, a two-stage adaptive robust optimization is proposed to optimize the objective function in the worst case scenario of the modeled uncertainties. The proposed optimization is solved with the column and constraint generation (C&CG) algorithm. The result obtained ensures robust microgrid operation in consideration of all possible realization of renewable generation, demand and unintentional islanding condition. The proposed model is validated with results of case studies on a microgrid consisting of various DGs and ESSs.","Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers","","Oak Ridge National Lab.

"Robustness of Power Distribution System: A Comparative Study of Network and Performance Based Metrics","Munikoti, Sai; Abujubbeh, Mohammad; Natarajan, Balasubramaniam","24 POWER TRANSMISSION AND DISTRIBUTION; voltage fluctuations; robustness; critical nodes; resilience; distribution network; measurement; load flow; power systems","Improving the resilience of the power distribution networks is becoming a top priority for the utility companies. Robustness is a key part of resilience, and is often studied through failure-based analysis. Furthermore, with the increasingly dynamic nature of the grid, voltage fluctuation is an important factor to consider while assessing system robustness. Very few metrics exist for capturing robustness to voltage fluctuations, primarily due to their complex computation process. While several failure-based robustness metrics have been proposed in the literature, there is no strict consensus regarding the applicability of these metrics. Therefore, this paper addresses two key gaps in robustness analysis of power distribution networks. First, this paper presents a systematic study of different failure-based robustness metrics by comparing their similarity and dissimilarity in ranking critical nodes of the power distribution network. Secondly, the efficacy of these metrics in characterizing voltage fluctuations is evaluated by comparing their ranking to that of voltage influencing scores. From experimental results, it is shown that hybrid failure-based metrics can quantify voltage fluctuations to a reasonable extent. Finally, we highlight the major shortcomings of current metric formulations and discuss possible future research directions related to robustness characteristics and analysis.","Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers","","Kansas State Univ., Manhattan, KS (United States)","USDOE Office of Energy Efficiency and Renewable Energy (EERE), Renewable Power Office.

Statistical robustness ensures estimation efficiency at the Gaussian and non-Gaussian probability distributions, including heavy-tailed distributions. The proposed RDMD is statistically robust because the outliers in the data set are flagged via projection statistics and suppressed using a Schweppe-type Huber generalized maximum-likelihood estimator that minimizes a convex Huber cost function. The latter is solved using the iteratively reweighted least-squares algorithm that is known to exhibit an excellent convergence property and numerical stability than the Newton algorithms. Several numerical simulations using canonical models of dynamical systems demonstrate the excellent performance of the proposed RDMD method. The results reveal that it outperforms several other methods proposed in the literature.","Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers","","National Renewable Energy Lab.

Aponte","24 POWER TRANSMISSION AND DISTRIBUTION; geographic information systems; power system planning; power system restoration; power transmission; resilience.","Limited access to transmission lines after a major contingency event can inhibit restoration efforts. After Hurricane Maria, for example, flooding and landslides damaged roads and thus limited travel. Transmission lines are also often situated far from maintained roadways, further limiting the ability to access and repair them. Therefore, this paper proposes a methodology for assessing Puerto Rico’s infrastructure (i.e., roads and transmission lines) to identify potentially hard to reach areas due to natural risks or distance to roads. The approach uses geographic information system (GIS) data to define vulnerable areas, that may experience excessive restoration times. The methodology also uses graph theory analysis to find transmission lines with high centrality (or importance). Comparison of these important transmission lines with the vulnerability results found that many reside near roads that are at risk for landslides or floods.","Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers","","Sandia National Lab.

In a CPPS, the physical layer usually consists of the power grid and protection devices, whereas the cyber layer consists of communication, computation, and control components. This paper provides a review on the existing approaches to model CPPS and to characterize the inter- and intra-actions for distributed autonomous systems. The CPPS models can then be used to perform various analyses, such as cyberattack analysis, threat analysis, and resilience analysis. A qualitative evaluation criteria for the various modeling paradigm is discussed to help researchers understand the trade-offs in choosing the right modeling method for their particular application.","Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers","","National Renewable Energy Lab.

These model-based applications interact with multiple subsystems within software platforms referred to as advanced distribution management systems (ADMS). Recently, CIM-based models have been used to enable data model standardization across several entities. However, distribution system models are error-prone and model validation is challenging due to: (1) the need for considerable effort and time to maintain the network models, (2) delays in model updating due to the evolving nature of the real-world systems that models are derived from, and (3) inevitable human errors in the process which are difficult to detect. In this paper, we extend a model validation application from our prior work referred to as the Model Validator (MV) to derive and validate a system admittance matrix from a CIM model. First, different modules are introduced for computing device-level primitive admittance matrices from a CIM model. Furthermore, these individual primitive admittance matrices are then validated against the appropriate entries in the full system admittance matrix. In addition, we also validate the overall system admittance matrix for checking the gaps in coverage or extra elements that are not expected. The MV application is developed and integrated with an open-source standards-based platform for ADMS application development, GridAPPS-D. The effectiveness of the proposed application is demonstrated on six different test cases: four IEEE feeders, an EPRI circuit, and a PNNL taxonomy feeder.","Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers","","Pacific Northwest National Lab.

To address this problem ERCOT is implementing a number of market rule changes including the introduction of a new Fast Frequency Response (FFR) reserve type to the electricity market. This FFR reserve type aims to help the traditional Primary Frequency Response (PFR) reserve type in arresting frequency decline in the event of a large generator outage. This paper derives reserve requirements to ensure sufficient reserve to arrest frequency decline before reaching the critical frequency threshold while coupling PFR reserve, FFR reserve, and system inertia. The general reserve requirement places limits on the amount of PFR reserve that can be provided by each unit based on its ramping capabilities. Two such limits are derived from first principles and another is proposed that is capable of accommodating the equivalency ratio introduced in previous work. These PFR reserve limits also provide first principles insight into equivalency ratios, which have only been studied empirically in the past.

This is aided by largescale proliferation of renewables (both at a centralized scale as well as in more distributed settings such as rooftop solar) and the growing potential for energy usage flexibility, which subsumes the increasingly widespread use of energy storage. In this paper, we propose a mathematical framework which considers the interaction of energy flexibility (e.g., storage functionality) and renewable generation in a transactive power system, where a grid operator can secure both generation and flexibility (storage) resources from centralized and/or distributed assets. Our results, derived under network-abstracted settings, mathematically relate the system operating cost to the available storage capacity. In addition, our proposed framework also characterizes the inflection point beyond which further addition of storage capacity do not affect cost of system operation. Furthermore, the relationship between the price spread in the grid, i.e., difference between maximum and minimum prices over the time horizon under consideration, and the available storage capacity, is also commented upon.

However, power electronics engineers tend to rely on metrics such as efficiency and power density which do not guarantee lifetime cost optimality. Recent work has shown that an LCOE-focused optimization approach can yield improved system designs, leading to improved lifetime performance with balanced lifetime cost and energy generation. This paper outlines an LCOE optimization framework for PV power electronics that uses geometric programming. The large number of circuit parameters and nonlinear nature of the system equations pose significant barriers. Our approach allows for decoupling of design variables which in turn enables superior computational efficiency and a near-optimal solution. By incorporating the power electronics design process and magnetic loss mechanism into the convex design framework, the optimization engine yields practically implementable parameters for a PV converter that minimizes LCOE. An optimization example for a cascaded modular PV inverter architecture is presented that suggests 3.35% LCOE improvement can be achieved by the new power electronics and the advanced optimization. The proposed optimization framework can be applied to other power generation systems to evaluate the effect of the power electronics design on system lifetime costs and efficiency.","Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers","","National Renewable Energy Lab.

Nathan","24 POWER TRANSMISSION AND DISTRIBUTION; power grid; dynamic mode decomposition; data driven forecasting; Gaussian process regression; load forecasting","Time series forecasting remains a central challenge problem in almost all scientific disciplines, including load modeling in power systems engineering. The ability to produce accurate forecasts has major implications for real-time control, pricing, maintenance, and security decisions. We introduce a novel load forecasting method in which observed dynamics are modeled as a forced linear system using Dynamic Mode Decomposition (DMD) in time delay coordinates. Central to this approach is the insight that grid load, like many observables on complex real-world systems, has an ”almost-periodic” character, i.e., a continuous Fourier spectrum punctuated by dominant peaks, which capture regular (e.g., daily or weekly) recurrences in the dynamics. The forecasting method presented takes advantage of this property by (i) regressing to a deterministic linear model whose eigenspectrum maps onto those peaks, and (ii) simultaneously learning a stochastic Gaussian process regression (GPR) process to actuate this system. Our forecasting algorithm is compared against state-of-the-art forecasting techniques not using additional explanatory variables and is shown to produce superior performance. Moreover, its use of linear intrinsic dynamics offers a number of desirable properties in terms of interpretability and parsimony. Results are presented for a test case using load data from an electrical grid. Load forecasting is an essential challenge in power systems engineering, with major implications for real-time control, pricing, maintenance, and security decisions.","Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers","","Pacific Northwest National Lab.

This paper presents the details of the development of a data-enhanced hierarchical control (DEHC) architecture and the results of its evaluation. The DEHC is a hybrid control framework that enables the efficient, reliable, and secure operation of distribution grids with extremely high penetrations of solar photovoltaic (PV) generation by seamlessly integrating centralized utility controls, distributed controls for DERs, and autonomous grid-edge controls. In the DEHC architecture, the advanced distribution management system (ADMS) controls the legacy devices (such as load tap changers and capacitor banks), the PV smart inverters are dispatched by real-time optimal power flow, and the grid-edge devices regulate local voltages in coordination with each other. The DEHC is demonstrated using a commercial ADMS platform, real utility distribution feeder models, and grid-edge devices. The performance of the DEHC architecture is evaluated using simulations and hardware-in-the-loop experiments with voltage regulation as the control objective. The results show that the DEHC enables high penetration levels of PV in distribution feeders by effectively managing system voltages through the synergistic operation of ADMS, distributed PV smart inverter controls, and secondary-level grid-edge device control.","Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers","","National Renewable Energy Lab.

CPES security evaluation is challenging since the physical and cyber layers are often not considered holistically. Existing literature focuses on only optimizing the operation of either the physical or cyber layer while ignoring the interactions between them. This paper proposes a metric, the Cyber-Physical Energy System Quantitative Security Metric (CPES-QSM), that quantifies the interaction between the cyber and physical layers across three domains: electrical, cyber-risk, and network topology. A method for incorporating the proposed cyber-metric into operational decisions is also proposed by formulating a cyber-constrained AC optimal power flow (C-ACOPF) that considers the status of all the CPES layers. The C-ACOPF considers the vulnerabilities of physical and cyber networks by incorporating factors such as voltage stability, contingencies, graph-theory, and IoT cyber risks, while using a multi-criteria decision-making technique. We note that simulation studies are conducted using standard IEEE test systems to evaluate the effectiveness of the proposed metric and the C-ACOPF formulation.","IEEE","","Los Alamos National Lab.

"240$^\circ$-Clamped PWM Applied to Transformerless Grid Connected PV Converters With Reduced Common Mode Voltage and Superior Performance Metrics","Qamar, Haleema; Qamar, Hafsa; Korada, Nikhil; Ayyanar, Rajapandian","14 SOLAR ENERGY; 24 POWER TRANSMISSION AND DISTRIBUTION; 32 ENERGY CONSERVATION, CONSUMPTION, AND UTILIZATION; 240° clamped PWM (240CPWM); common mode voltage (CMV); leakage current; photovoltaic (PV); pulse width modulation (PWM); voltage source inverter (VSI); switching loss","Transformerless voltage source inverters (VSIs) are one of the popular topologies for photovoltaic (PV) grid-connected applications due to the lowest component count and simple design. Because of the absence of galvanic isolation in such systems, problem of electromagnetic interference (EMI) due to high leakage current is highly pronounced. Recently various reduced common mode voltage (CMV) PWM (RCMV-PWM) methods which address these issues of CMV, and leakage current have been proposed. These schemes typically function at the expense of increased total harmonic distortion (THD), higher switching loss, high DC link current stress along with limited modulation index range. In this work, 240 ° clamped PWM (240CPWM) is selected as an ideal candidate for grid connected VSIs in terms of all round performance of switching loss, THD, DC link current stress, CMV and leakage current. 240CPWM is a relatively new space vector based PWM method which can attain much superior performance by avoiding the zero states. After a brief overview of the 240CPWM concept, the paper provides a detailed comparison of 240CPWM with conventional space vector PWM (CSVPWM) and discontinuous PWM (DPWM1) methods in terms of each of the above metrics. A 3-phase 208 V 3 kW silicon IGBT based hardware prototype is built to validate the performance of 240CPWM and compared with other popular schemes under grid-connected mode. Experimental results show a 66.7% reduction in the peak CMV and 50% reduction in leakage current with the proposed scheme as compared to CSVPWM. Also, THD, DC link current stress and inverter switching loss are greatly reduced as an added advantage using the proposed method. A new, combined performance index is proposed to compare the performance of different PWM schemes, and it is shown that the 240CPWM achieves the best value for this index among the PWM methods studied.","Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers","","Arizona State Univ., Tempe, AZ (United States)","USDOE Office of Energy Efficiency and Renewable Energy (EERE), Renewable Power Office.

This paper presents a highly automated, novel method to enhance the accuracy of utility distribution feeder models to capture their performance by matching simulation results with corresponding field measurements. The method is demonstrated using an actual feeder from an electrical utility with high penetration of DERs. The method proposed uses advanced metering infrastructure (AMI) voltage and derived active power measurements at the customer level, and data acquisition systems (DAS) measurements at the feeder-head, in conjunction with an AC optimal power flow (ACOPF) to estimate customer active and reactive power consumption over a time horizon, while accounting for unmetered loads. The ACOPF uses the measured voltage magnitudes, derived active power measurements, and the feeder head measurements to obtain a complete active power and reactive power capture of the feeder loads. Additionally, the method proposed estimates both voltage magnitude and angle for each phase at the unbalanced distribution substation. The accuracy of the method developed is verified in two stages: by comparing the time-series power flow results obtained from the enhancement algorithm with OpenDSS results and with the field measurements available.

The differential and algebraic equations considering uncertainties from dynamic PVs and loads are reformulated to a nonlinear mapping relationship that allows the application of SGP. Thanks to the nonparametric characteristic of Gaussian process, the proposed framework does not require distributions of uncertain inputs and this distinguishes it from existing approaches. As the original Gaussian process is not scalable to large-scale systems with high dimensional uncertain inputs, this paper develops the SGP with a stochastic variational inference technique. It leads to approximately two orders of complex reduction. A data pre-processing step is also introduced to tackle the coexistence of stable and unstable cases by sample clustering and constructing separate SGPs. The probabilistic transient stability index is analyzed to assess system stability under different uncertain dynamics loads and PVs. Comparisons are performed with the sampling-based, the polynomial chaos expansion-based, and traditional Gaussian process-based methods on the modified IEEE 118-bus and Texas 2000-bus systems under various scenarios, including different levels of uncertainties and the existence of nonlinear correlations among dynamic PVs. The impacts of data quality and quantity issues are also investigated. It is shown that the proposed SGP achieves significantly improved computational efficiency while maintaining high accuracy with a limited number of data.","IEEE","External Audience (Unlimited)","Lawrence Livermore National Lab.

The first step is to select the weighting functions that bound the transfer functions for the entire range of uncertainty. The second step is to form mathematical representation for both robust stability and robust performance. The third step is to conduct the robust H-infinity controller synthesis to generate the full-order controller, and then carry out order reduction and recheck of the design objectives. The last step is to select an optimized controller based on the multi-dimensional Pareto Front algorithm. The proposed method has been firstly applied to the current controller design of a grid-connected inverter with variable grid impedance, and secondly to the voltage controller design of an LLC resonant DC/DC converter with variable resonant capacitance. The results indicate that the selected optimal H-infinity controller has an overall more satisfactory performance in terms of stability, steady-state error, disturbance/noise rejection capability and dynamic performance, compared with conventional PI and PR controllers when there is a large variation of system parameters.","Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers","","Arizona State Univ., Tempe, AZ (United States)","USDOE Office of Energy Efficiency and Renewable Energy (EERE), Renewable Power Office.

Simulations of TE systems are crucial to evaluate the benefits and impacts of different transactive mechanisms. However, such simulations can be time consuming due to the information exchange between various participants and complex co-simulation environments. In this paper, we develop a reduced order model to speed up the simulation of transactive systems in TE simulation platform (TESP) while achieving very low error between the reduced order and full model results. Specifically, the developed reduced order model consists of an aggregate responsive load agent which utilizes two Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs) with Long Short-Term Memory units (LSTMs) to enable transactive elements to collectively participate in the TE system. The proposed aggregate responsive load (ARL) agent is able to produce similar transactive behaviors to the full simulation model while achieving significant simulation time reduction.

Conventional model-based voltage control methods rely on accurate parameters of the distribution networks, which are difficult to achieve in practice. This paper proposes a novel physical-model-free two-timescale voltage control framework for active distribution systems. To achieve fast control of PV inverters, the whole network is first partitioned into several subnetworks using voltage-reactive power sensitivity. Then, the scheduling of PV inverters in the multiple sub-networks is formulated as Markov games and solved by a multi-agent soft actor-critic (MASAC) algorithm, where each subnetwork is modeled as an intelligent agent. All agents are trained in a centralized manner to learn a coordinated strategy while being executed based on only local information for fast response. For the slower time-scale control, OLTCs and switched capacitors are coordinated by a single agent-based SAC algorithm using the global information with considering control behaviors of the inverters. Particularly, the two-level agents are trained concurrently with information exchange according to the reward signal calculated from the data-driven surrogate model. Comparative tests with different benchmark methods on IEEE 33-and 123-bus systems and 342-node low voltage distribution system demonstrate that the proposed method can effectively mitigate the fast voltage violations and achieve systematical coordination of different voltage regulation assets without the knowledge of accurate system model.","IEEE","","National Renewable Energy Lab.

However, dynamic control of these resources in concert with traditional building loads, to effect efficiency and demand flexibility, is not yet commonplace in commercial control products. Traditional rule-based control algorithms do not offer integrated closed-loop control to optimize across systems, and most often, PV and battery systems are operated for energy arbitrage and demand charge management, and not for the provision of grid services. More advanced control approaches, such as MPC control have not been widely adopted in industry because they require significant expertise to develop and deploy. Recent advances in deep reinforcement learning (DRL) offer a promising option to optimize the operation of DER systems and building loads with reduced setup effort. However, there are limited studies that evaluate the efficacy of these methods to control multiple building subsystems simultaneously. Additionally, most of the research has been conducted in simulated environments as opposed to real buildings. This paper proposes a DRL approach that uses a deep deterministic policy gradient algorithm for integrated control of HVAC and electric battery storage systems in the presence of on-site PV generation. The DRL algorithm, trained on synthetic data, was deployed in a physical test building and evaluated against a baseline that uses the current best-in-class rule-based control strategies. Performance in delivering energy efficiency, load shift, and load shed was tested using price-based signals. The results showed that the DRL-based controller can produce cost savings of up to 39.6% as compared to the baseline controller, while maintaining similar thermal comfort in the building. The project team has also integrated the simulation components developed during this work as an OpenAIGym environment and made it publicly available so that prospective DRL researchers can leverage this environment to evaluate alternate DRL algorithms.","Elsevier","","Lawrence Berkeley National Lab.

Although reservoirs may help buffer natural hydrologic variability, severe droughts can deplete storage below critical thresholds, or to levels at which the effluent water temperature becomes too high to meet the environmental compliance requirement for cooling. This study explores the effects of projected climate change and drought events on water storage at 30 major reservoirs that collectively provide cooling water for about two thirds of thermoelectric power capacity in the Electric Reliability Council of Texas (ERCOT) power grid. Multi-ensemble future runoff projections generated from eleven downscaled hydroclimate simulations are mapped to key watersheds to create spatially correlated multi-reservoir inflow sequences. These data are used to drive reservoir operations, which are linked to an industry-adopted metric of “thermal capacity at risk” using critical thresholds intended to represent storage volumes below which generation could become severely disrupted. The projected impacts of climate change are mixed, with results indicating an increase in the occurrence of widespread thermal disruption under only half of climate models, while three models project reduced occurrence of widespread thermal disruptions. A critical threshold of 30% storage volume—applied to all reservoirs—results in disruption to about one fifth of ERCOT thermal generation during a small number of severe projected droughts. The study highlights an important role for detailed reservoir behavior simulations for better understanding the effects of drought and climate change on thermoelectric plant performance. Site-specific reservoir specifications, including intake levels and withdrawal and effluent temperature limits, are required to enhance results with quantified, plant-specific thermoelectric derating impacts associated with simulated droughts.","Elsevier","","Sandia National Lab.

Nowadays, there are several management strategies for DR such as the price-based transactive control strategies. However, many of such existing price-based control strategies neglect the physics and operational constraints of the underlying distribution networks when computing the price, raising concerns regarding their theoretical and practical values. This paper studies this issue and investigates optimal DR (ODR) by incorporating the distribution locational marginal price (DLMP). In particular, we discuss DR in connection with DLMPs and propose a multiperiod bilevel optimization problem to find the ODR strategy. Here, the objective is to minimize the peak load, load fluctuation, and payments of load aggregators. In addition, a robust bilevel ODR model is formulated to provide a robust ODR strategy while minimizing operating costs under the worst-case realization of uncertainties; this mitigates the impact of forecasting errors on renewable energy resources. Then, we propose an efficient solution approach by employing the Karush-Kuhn-Tucker conditions and strong duality. Simulation results are presented to illustrate the mutual impacts of the interaction between DR and DLMP and the benefits of the robust ODR strategy.","IEEE","","Oak Ridge National Lab.

In 2023, five categories of DERs-distributed solar, electric vehicles (EVs), energy storage, residential smart thermostats, and small-scale combined heat and power-are expected to contribute about 104 GW to the U.S. summer peak (see GTM, 2018). With the increasing integration of DERs in power distribution systems, distributed load control is imperative to smooth the fluctuations that they introduce. However, a main challenge is that distribution systems lack systematic situational awareness because of their limited sensors. Furthermore, most customer-level behind-the-meter (BTM) DERs, such as rooftop photovoltaics (PVs), are being integrated into distribution systems, which complicates the system monitoring and control. Furthermore, enhanced electric grid monitoring is needed to promote renewable integration while ensuring reliability, but current approaches rely on expensive sensors.","IEEE Xplore","","Iowa State Univ., Ames, IA (United States)","USDOE Office of Electricity (OE)","","United States","2021-09-02T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: IEEE Electrification Magazine; Journal Volume: 9; Journal Issue: 3","","Medium: ED; Size: p. 92-103","","","OE0000875","Journal ID: ISSN 2325-5897","10.1109/mele.2021.3093636","","2023-03-17T00:00:00Z","1961206","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/1961206","https://www.osti.gov/servlets/purl/1961206","IEEE Electrification Magazine","3","9"

This paper integrates transactive energy control into the distribution system reliability evaluation to quantitatively assess the impact of non-utility owned DERs on reliability improvement. Here, a transactive reactive power control strategy is designed to incentivize the DERs to provide reactive power support for improving voltage profiles thus enabling additional customer load restoration during an outage. Also, an operational sequence to coordinate the non-utility owned DERs with the utility owned self-healing control and utility owned microgrids is designed and integrated into the service restoration process with the operational constraints guaranteed by checking the three-phase unbalanced power flow for post-fault network reconfiguration. The reliability indices are then calculated through a Monte Carlo simulation.

Additionally, the characteristics of electricity-driven coupling components, including water pumps and gas compressors, are also modeled. Relaxation techniques are applied to non convex constraints posed by physical laws of those networks. Consequently, the restoration problem is formulated as a mixed-integer second-order cone program, which can readily be solved by the off-the-shelf solvers. The proposed method is validated by numerical simulations on an electricity-water-gas integrated system, developed based on benchmark models of the subsystems.

Previous studies suggest that combined heat and power (CHP) systems may support grid flexibility but they do not consider operating hours. In this paper, we used CHP operating data and determined annual and monthly availability of the installed CHP capacity from various sectors (e.g., utility, independent power producer, commercial, and industrial) in all seven U.S. independent system operators (ISOs) and regional transmission organizations (RTOs). Also, we estimated hourly CHP availability installed in five facility types (i.e., hospitals, universities, hotels, offices, and manufacturing) in the state of New York. The results show that regardless of ISO/RTO, sector, or season, more than 40% of the installed CHP capacity (0.7–8.7 GW) was not fully utilized in 2019; the results are similar for 2018. This available CHP capacity accounted for up to 9% of the ISO/RTO's peak electric demand, which may yield cost savings up to $16 billion by avoiding installation costs of new natural gas combustion or combined-cycle turbines. To exploit the available CHP capacity to enhance grid flexibility, we recommend different policy implications including flexible contract lengths between CHP owners and grid operators, improved market designs, and simplified interconnection standards.","Elsevier","","Lawrence Berkeley National Lab.

The restoration problem is formulated to coordinate distribution generators and controllable switches optimally. A model-based control scheme is usually designed to solve this problem, relying on a precise model and resulting in low scalability. To tackle these limitations, this work proposes a graph-reinforcement learning framework for the restoration problem. We link the power system topology with a graph convolutional network, which captures the complex mechanism of network restoration in power networks and understands the mutual interactions among controllable devices. Latent features over graphical power networks produced by graph convolutional layers are exploited to learn the control policy for network restoration using deep reinforcement learning. The solution scalability is guaranteed by modeling distributed generators as agents in a multi-agent environment and a proper pre-training paradigm.

"Neural Lyapunov Control for Power System Transient Stability: A Deep Learning-Based Approach","Zhao, Tianqiao; Wang, Jianhui; Lu, Xiaonan; Du, Yuhua","24 POWER TRANSMISSION AND DISTRIBUTION; machine learning; power system stability; Lyapunov function; neural Lyapunov control.","We report that power system control and transient stability analysis play essential roles in secure system operation. Control of power systems typically involves highly nonlinear and complex dynamics. Most of the existing works address such problems with additional assumptions in system dynamics, leading to a requirement for a complete and general solution. This paper, therefore, proposes a novel control framework for various power system control and stability problems leveraging a learning-based approach. The proposed framework includes a two-module structure that iteratively and jointly learns the candidate Lyapunov function and control law via deep neural networks in a learning module. Meanwhile, it guides the learning procedure towards valid results satisfying Lyapunov conditions in a falsification module. The introduced termination criteria ensure provable system stability. This control framework is verified through several studies handling different types of power system control problems. The results show that the proposed framework is generalizable and can simplify the control design for complex power systems with the stability guarantee and enlarged region of attraction.","IEEE","","Brookhaven National Lab.

This paper proposes current-source DC solid-state transformer (SST) for MVDC collection system in WT, PV, and ES farms or as an interface between the MVDC grid and the LVDC microgrid. Compared to conventional current-source converter (CSC) based SSTs, a switch reduction scheme on reverse-blocking device bridges is proposed to reduce device count and the number of devices on the DC-link current path. Importantly, the proposed switch reduction scheme is generic and can be applied to the DC ports of DC-AC, AC-DC, or DC-DC hard-switching or soft-switching CSC-based SSTs. Based on this scheme, the proposed current-source DC SSTs are derived, which have reduced electrolytic-capacitor-less DC-link. The proposed DC SSTs also achieve single-stage isolated DC-DC or DC-AC conversion, full-range zero-voltage switching (ZVS) for main switches, zero-current switching (ZCS) for resonant switches, and controlled dv/dt.

"Enriching Load Data Using Micro-PMUs and Smart Meters","Bu, Fankun; Dehghanpour, Kaveh; Wang, Zhaoyu","24 POWER TRANSMISSION AND DISTRIBUTION; Distribution system; load uncertainty; micro-PMU; smart meter; data enrichment","In modern distribution systems, load uncertainty can be fully captured by micro-PMUs, which can record high-resolution data; however, in practice, micro-PMUs are installed at limited locations in distribution networks due to budgetary constraints. In contrast, smart meters are widely deployed but can only measure relatively low-resolution energy consumption, which cannot sufficiently reflect the actual instantaneous load volatility within each sampling interval. In this paper, we have proposed a novel approach for enriching load data for service transformers that only have low-resolution smart meters. The key to our approach is to statistically recover the high-resolution load data, which is masked by the low-resolution data, using trained probabilistic models of service transformers that have both high- and low-resolution data sources, i.e., micro-PMUs and smart meters. The overall framework consists of two steps: first, for the transformers with micro-PMUs, a Gaussian Process is leveraged to capture the relationship between the maximum/minimum load and average load within each low-resolution sampling interval of smart meters; a Markov chain model is employed to characterize the transition probability of known high-resolution load. Next, the trained models are used as teachers for the transformers with only smart meters to decompose known low-resolution load data into targeted high-resolution load data. The enriched data can recover instantaneous load uncertainty and significantly enhance distribution system observability and situational awareness. Here, we have verified the proposed approach using real high- and low-resolution load data.","IEEE","","Iowa State Univ., Ames, IA (United States)","USDOE; National Science Foundation (NSF)","","United States","2021-08-02T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: IEEE Transactions on Smart Grid; Journal Volume: 12; Journal Issue: 6","","Medium: ED; Size: p. 5084-5094","","","OE0000875; EPCN 2042314","Journal ID: ISSN 1949-3053","10.1109/tsg.2021.3101685","","2023-03-17T00:00:00Z","1961199","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/1961199","https://www.osti.gov/servlets/purl/1961199","IEEE Transactions on Smart Grid","6","12"
"New Modulation and Impact of Transformer Leakage Inductance on Current-Source Solid-State Transformer","Zheng, Liran; Kandula, Rajendra Prasad; Kandasamy, Karthik; Divan, Deepak","25 ENERGY STORAGE; 14 SOLAR ENERGY; 17 WIND ENERGY; 24 POWER TRANSMISSION AND DISTRIBUTION; 32 ENERGY CONSERVATION, CONSUMPTION, AND UTILIZATION; 42 ENGINEERING; single-stage solid-state transformer (SST); medium-voltage power electronic transformer (PET); current-source converter (CSC); current-source inverter (CSI); medium-frequency transformer (MFT); high-frequency link (HFL) isolated; leakage inductance; modulation.","This article presents a novel modulation scheme for device voltage stress mitigation and comprehensive analysis of the impact of transformer leakage inductance in a current-source solid-state transformer (SST). Different from dual active bridge (DAB) SST, the operation of the current-source SST is similar to that of a flyback converter. The device bridge on only one side of the transformer is active to store energy into or release energy from the magnetizing inductance which acts as a current-source dc link. Such flyback operation with reverse-blocking switches can lead to additional device voltage stress and incomplete zero-voltage switching (ZVS) on the current-source soft-switching solid-state transformer (S4T) under conventional modulation. A new modulation scheme is proposed to address this issue. Moreover, different from the DAB, the leakage inductance of the medium-frequency transformer (MFT) in the S4T is a parasitic element similar to that in a matrix SST and can cause additional device voltage stress. Though the resonant capacitors, originally added to achieve ZVS, can absorb and recycle the leakage energy in the S4T, these capacitors need to be increased with larger leakage inductances to limit the voltage stress. However, large resonant capacitors can result in more lost duty cycles and reduced efficiency. The impact of such leakage inductance on device voltage stress is analyzed comprehensively, which is critical to guide future research and design of the S4T. Experimental results from S4T prototypes for DC-DC, multiport AC-DC, and AC-AC conversion with 1:1 and 4:1 MFT comprehensively verify the proposed concepts. Lastly, a case study of a three-phase AC-AC S4T over a power range from 1 kVA to 100 kVA each module reveals that the MFT leakage inductance should be less than 1% of the magnetizing inductance for safe operation.","IEEE","","Georgia Institute of Technology, Atlanta, GA (United States)","USDOE Advanced Research Projects Agency - Energy (ARPA-E)","","United States","2021-08-04T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: IEEE Transactions on Power Electronics; Journal Volume: 37; Journal Issue: 1","","Medium: ED; Size: p. 562-576","","","AR0000899","Journal ID: ISSN 0885-8993","10.1109/tpel.2021.3101811","","2022-10-19T00:00:00Z","1892477","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/1892477","https://www.osti.gov/servlets/purl/1892477","IEEE Transactions on Power Electronics","1","37"

However, existing emergency control schemes are rule-based and cannot be adaptively applied to uncertain and floating operating conditions. Here, we propose an adaptive UVLS algorithm for emergency control via deep reinforcement learning (DRL) and expert systems. We first construct dynamic components for picturing the power system operation as the environment. The transient voltage recovery criteria, which poses time-varying requirements to UVLS, is integrated into the states and reward function to advise the learning of deep neural networks. The proposed method has no tuning issue of coefficients in reward functions, and this issue was regarded as a deficiency in the existing DRL-based algorithms. Case studies illustrate that the proposed method outperforms the traditional UVLS relay in both the timeliness and efficacy for emergency control.","IEEE","","Brookhaven National Lab.

To solve these challenges, a linearised three-phase optimal power flow (OPF) model is proposed to coordinate the operation of residential solid-state power substations for voltage regulation and phase balancing of distribution feeders. The proposed three-phase OPF model schedules both real and reactive power of each components in the SSPSs with the purpose of minimising the total operating cost as well as improving the grid performance, for example, voltage regulation and phase balancing.

The paper starts with modeling a gas turbine, gearbox, and generator sitting on the rigid shafts as a two-mass model primarily for estimating the rotational inertia available from the turbogenerator. The gas turbine and its environment impose constraints of available space allowances, measurements from high-speed rotating parts, lack of accessibility to the shaft of measure, making replacements and/or required installation adjustments of the torque transducer difficult. It is demonstrated that in the absence of torque measurement, the data containing only a slow excursion of the rotor motion in response to a slight load change is sufficient to determine inertia and damping coefficients from the model. Furthermore, the generator’s reactive power capability was investigated because it serves as an asset in integrated hybrid systems to meet dynamic reactive power demands, reducing the burden on the fuel cell’s power electronics control in generating reactive power.","IEEE","","National Energy Technology Laboratory (NETL), Pittsburgh, PA, Morgantown, WV, and Albany, OR (United States); Oak Ridge Inst. for Science and Education (ORISE), Oak Ridge, TN (United States)","USDOE Office of Fossil Energy (FE)","","United States","2021-07-13T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: IEEE Transactions on Power Systems; Journal Volume: 37; Journal Issue: 1","","Medium: ED; Size: p. 543-550","","","89243318CFE000003","Journal ID: ISSN 0885-8950","10.1109/tpwrs.2021.3091964","","2022-07-18T00:00:00Z","1868086","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/1868086","https://www.osti.gov/servlets/purl/1868086","IEEE Transactions on Power Systems","1","37"

"Harmonic cancellation within AC low voltage distribution for a realistic office environment","Santos, Arthur; Duggan, Gerald P.; Young, Peter; Frank, Stephen; Hughes, Aidan; Zimmerle, Daniel","24 POWER TRANSMISSION AND DISTRIBUTION; AC converters; diversity factor; harmonic cancellation","An increase of non-linear loads, primarily from power electronics, has substantially increased current harmonics in commercial buildings, which contributes to decreased transformer efficiency / lifespan and poor power quality. This study uses recorded power consumption data from common miscellaneous electric loads (MELs) seen in offices, combined with detailed characterizations of example MELs, to simulate harmonic cancellation within building circuits. Typically, harmonic cancellation studies assume that AC converters operate across their rated power range. However, this study finds that common MELs operate below 40% of rated power the majority of the time when not quiescent; 89% of sampled devices never operated above 60% of rated power. Simulations using these more realistic power levels indicate current-harmonic cancellation (3rd to 13th harmonic) is significantly lower than that predicted when using full-range power assumptions, resulting in minor errors for low-order harmonics and larger errors for higher order harmonics. Furthermore, increased MELs load diversity increases harmonic cancellation, but insufficiently to eliminate errors. In contrast, blending lighting loads with MELs on the secondaries of distribution transformers improves harmonic cancellation to near those predicted by traditional methods.

"Iteration-based Linearized Distribution-level Locational Marginal Price for Three-phase Unbalanced Distribution Systems","Cai, Mengmeng; Yang, Rui; Zhang, Yingchen","24 POWER TRANSMISSION AND DISTRIBUTION; distribution-level LMP; linear OPF; successive linear programming","Distributed energy resources (DERs) are rocking the utilities’ business landscape. It calls for competitive market environments that incentivize DERs to form maximum operating efficiency. Among proposed pricing schemes, distribution-level locational marginal price (DLMP) is effective in signaling the marginal generation cost differences driven by energy losses and network constraints. It can be derived from a distribution-level optimal power flow (OPF) framework, as it essentially presents the sensitivity of optimized generation cost towards incremental loads. However, due to the high resistance-to-inductance ratio and unbalanced characteristics of distribution networks, computational affordable DLMPs are highly challenged. This article provides a linear-approximated DLMP that can be solved efficiently and generalized to account for reactive power flow, three-phase unbalanced loads and meshed network structure. The successive linear programming technique is introduced to enhance the model accuracy. Case studies on an IEEE 123-Bus system validate its accuracy against a nonlinear benchmark and capability in offering proper incentives.","IEEE","","National Renewable Energy Lab.

"Opening Up Transactive Systems: Introducing TESS and Specification in a Field Deployment","Arlt, Marie-Louise; Chassin, David P.; Kiesling, L. Lynne","24 POWER TRANSMISSION AND DISTRIBUTION; electricity; transactive energy; market-based dispatch; bidding functions; automated bidding","Transactive energy systems (TS) use automated device bidding to access (residential) demand flexibility and coordinate supply and demand on the distribution system level through market processes. In this work, we present TESS, a modularized platform for the implementation of TS, which enables the deployment of adjusted market mechanisms, economic bidding, and the potential entry of third parties. TESS thereby opens up current integrated closed-system TS, allows for the better adaptation of TS to power systems with high shares of renewable energies, and lays the foundations for a smart grid with a variety of stakeholders. Furthermore, despite positive experiences in various pilot projects, one hurdle in introducing TS is their integration with existing tariff structures and (legal) requirements. In this paper, we therefore describe TESS as we have modified it for a field implementation within the service territory of Holy Cross Energy in Colorado. Importantly, our specification addresses challenges of implementing TS in existing electric retail systems, for instance, the design of bidding strategies when a (non-transactive) tariff system is already in place. We conclude with a general discussion of the challenges associated with “brownfield” implementation of TS, such as incentive problems of baseline approaches or long-term efficiency.","MDPI","","SLAC National Accelerator Lab., Menlo Park, CA (United States); Ludwig Maximilian Univ. of Munich, Munich (Germany); Univ. of Colorado, Denver, CO (United States)","USDOE Office of Electricity (OE)","","United States","2021-07-02T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: Energies; Journal Volume: 14; Journal Issue: 13","","Medium: ED; Size: Article No. 3970","","","AC02-76SF00515","Journal ID: ISSN 1996-1073; TRN: US2213935","10.3390/en14133970","","2022-10-07T00:00:00Z","1818154","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/1818154","https://www.osti.gov/servlets/purl/1818154","Energies","13","14"

Our approach allows us to decompose PMU event responses into a non-dynamic component (denoted the participation factor) that can be inferred directly from the past and a dynamic component that can be inferred directly from all other PMUs (denoted the event strength). When missing values occur, we can use these two components, which do not rely on the missing index, to estimate the correct value. The method is extremely fast and can easily be used for online applications. Furthermore, extensive testing on real power system event data reveals that our approach achieves state-of-the-art performance in terms of Mean Absolute Percent Errors (MAPEs) for PMU data dropped during event periods. Here, the method also yields an interpretable and simplified view of events for further analysis and applications.

Then, the wave arrival time difference-based triangulation method considering the anisotropy of wave propagation speed is utilized to estimate the location of the detected event. Next, the two-dimensional orthogonal locality preserving projection (2D-OLPP)-based method, which is suitable for multiple types of measured data, is employed to achieve higher effectiveness in extracting the event features compared with traditional one-dimensional projection and principle component analysis (PCA). Finally, the random undersampling boosted (RUSBoosted) trees-based classifier, which can mitigate the data sample imbalance issue, is utilized to identify the type of the detected event.

"Grid-Scale Ternary-Pumped Thermal Electricity Storage for Flexible Operation of Nuclear Power Generation under High Penetration of Renewable Energy Sources","Hovsapian, Rob; Osorio, Julian D.; Panwar, Mayank; Chryssostomidis, Chryssostomos; Ordonez, Juan C.","24 POWER TRANSMISSION AND DISTRIBUTION; flexible operation; grid integration; nuclear reactor; t-PTES; ternary-pumped thermal electricity storage; thermal-electrical co-simulation","In this work, the integration of a grid-scale ternary-Pumped Thermal Electricity Storage (t-PTES) with a nuclear power generation to enhance operation flexibility is assessed using physics-based models and digital real time simulation. A part of the electricity from the nuclear power generation is delivered to the grid, and the balance is used to power a heat pump that can be augmented by an auxiliary resistive load element to increase the charging rate of the thermal storage. This increases the thermal potential between hot and cold thermal stores (usually solid materials or molten salts inside large storage tanks). The thermal energy is transformed back into electricity by reversing the heat pump cycle. Different transient scenarios including startup, shutdown, and power change for grid-connected operation are simulated to determine the behavior of the hybrid nuclear-t-PTES system operating under variable loads that constitute a departure from conventional, baseload nuclear plant operation schemes. Ternary refers to the three modes operation: (i) heat pump (including heating coil), (ii) heat engine, and (iii) simultaneous operation of heat pump (including heating coil) and heat engine during changeover from pumping to generation or vice-versa. The controllability of t-PTES in the short timescales as a dynamic load is used to demonstrate operational flexibility of hybrid nuclear plants for flexible operation through advanced load management. The integration of t-PTES into nuclear power systems enhances the system flexibility and is an enabler for high penetration of renewable energy resources.","MDPI AG","","National Renewable Energy Lab.

"Mitigating Smart Meter Asynchrony Error Via Multi-Objective Low Rank Matrix Recovery","Yuan, Yuxuan; Dehghanpour, Kaveh; Wang, Zhaoyu","24 POWER TRANSMISSION AND DISTRIBUTION; Smart meters; sensor asynchrony; low rank matrix recovery; multi-objective optimization","Smart meters (SMs) are being widely deployed by distribution utilities across the U.S. Despite their benefits in real-time monitoring. SMs suffer from certain data quality issues; specifically, unlike phasor measurement units (PMUs) that use GPS for data synchronization, SMs are not perfectly synchronized. The asynchrony error can degrade the monitoring accuracy in distribution networks. To address this challenge, we propose a principal component pursuit (PCP)-based data recovery strategy. Since asynchrony results in a loss of temporal correlation among SMs, the key idea in our solution is to leverage a PCP-based low rank matrix recovery technique to maximize the temporal correlation between multiple data streams obtained from SMs. Further, our approach has a novel multi-objective structure, which allows utilities to precisely refine and recover all SM-measured variables, including voltage and power measurements, while incorporating their inherent dependencies through power flow equations. Here, we have performed numerical experiments using real SM data to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed strategy in mitigating the impact of SM asynchrony on distribution grid monitoring.","IEEE","","Iowa State Univ., Ames, IA (United States)","USDOE Office of Electricity (OE); National Science Foundation (NSF)","","United States","2021-06-14T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: IEEE Transactions on Smart Grid; Journal Volume: 12; Journal Issue: 5","","Medium: ED; Size: p. 4308-4317","","","OE0000875; EPCN 2042314","Journal ID: ISSN 1949-3053","10.1109/tsg.2021.3088835","","2023-03-17T00:00:00Z","1961208","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/1961208","https://www.osti.gov/servlets/purl/1961208","IEEE Transactions on Smart Grid","5","12"

It is useful to analyze resilience issues not only for bulk supply, but at all levels including at a customer level. This is because distributed energy resources can play a prominent role in enhancing resilience. Although the literature on planning models, tools and data for bulk supply and distribution systems have expanded in recent years, customer-centric planning, e.g., for an individual household, is yet to receive adequate attention. Although solar PV and battery storage at a household level have been analyzed, how these resources can be optimally combined, together with grid supply, from a resilience perspective is the focus of this study. The study demonstrates how a conceptual framework can be developed to show the trade-off between system costs and resilience including its dimensions such as duration, depth and frequency of service outages. A planning model is developed that incorporates multiple facets of resilience and individual customer preferences. The model considers power system resilience explicitly as a constraint. The model is implemented for a household level case study in Miami, Florida. The results show there are complex trade-offs among different dimensions of resilience. The study demonstrates how combined resilience metrics can be formulated and evaluated using the proposed least-cost planning model at a household level to optimize grid supply together with solar, battery storage and diesel generators. The model allows a planner to directly embed a resilience standard to drive the optimal supply mix. These concepts and the modeling construct can also be applied at other levels of planning, including community level and bulk supply system planning.","IEEE","","National Renewable Energy Lab.

Energy storage can enable dispatchable renewables, but only with drastic cost reductions compared to current batteries. One electricity storage concept that could enable these cost reductions stores electricity as sensible heat in an extremely hot liquid (>2000 °C) and uses multi-junction photovoltaics (MPV) as a heat engine to convert it back to electricity on demand, hours or days later. This paper follows previously reported technoeconomics and liquid containment, examining equipment that would be needed to exchange heat between resistive heaters, a molten silicon storage tank above 2000 °C, and a heat engine. Herein, we report on a pump that was designed and tested to circulate the liquid silicon between these three regions and the effect of spatial thermal cycling was simulated in models and experiments. While the pump successfully circulated silicon between 1800-2080 °C for ten hours, circulation with a temperature gradient caused it and other non-isothermal experiments to dissolve significantly due to the temperature dependent solubility of not only carbon, but also silicon carbide which otherwise protected the graphite infrastructure. Furthermore, methods to reduce dissolution and an alternative embodiment are presented.","Elsevier","","Massachusetts Inst. of Technology (MIT), Cambridge, MA (United States)","USDOE Advanced Research Projects Agency - Energy (ARPA-E); USDOE Office of Energy Efficiency and Renewable Energy (EERE)","","United States","2021-06-11T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: Energy; Journal Volume: 233","","Medium: ED; Size: Article No. 121105","","","EE0008381; AR0001858; EE0008375","Journal ID: ISSN 0360-5442","10.1016/j.energy.2021.121105","","2022-09-19T00:00:00Z","1879108","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/1879108","https://www.osti.gov/servlets/purl/1879108","Energy","","233"

A data-driven network optimisation approach is proposed to coordinate the control of distributed PVs and smart buildings in distribution networks considering the uncertainties of solar power, outdoor temperature and heat gain associated with building thermal dynamics. These uncertain parameters have a significant impact on the operation and control of distributed PVs and smart buildings, bringing challenges to the distribution system operation. In the proposed data-driven distributionally robust optimisation (DRO) approach, the Wasserstein ball is used to construct an ambiguity set for the uncertain parameters, which does not require the probability distributions to be known. Furthermore, a conditional value-at-risk is incorporated into the Wasserstein-based DRO model and converted into a computationally tractable mixed-integer convex optimisation problem. Benchmarked with robust optimisation and chance-constrained programming, the proposed data-driven model can give a less conservative robust solution.","The Institution of Engineering and Technology","","Oak Ridge National Lab.

The inconvenience cost function simulates mode choice between BEVs and alternative modes by heterogenous travelers.

In islanding mode, distributed energy sources with power electronics inverters can generate fault currents over a wide range of frequencies. To gain a better understanding of the nature of these events, it is crucial to measure currents at frequencies of up to 20 kHz at transient states with protective relays. Protective relays at these frequency responses should be tested prior to being installed in microgrids. However, testing at high-frequency currents cannot be done with Relay Test Equipment (RTE) that generate signals up to 50th Harmonic for 60 Hz (3 kHz). In this study, a frequency response method and testbed for high-frequency currents of up to 20.16 kHz was developed and tested. The testbed utilized a RTE and High-Frequency Power Source/ Amplifier. Furthermore, frequency relay experiments were run at frequencies of up to 1 and 20.16 kHz at a current magnitude of 0.1 and 0.5 A, respectively. The events were collected, and the current magnitude and frequency were plotted at time and frequency domain, respectively. The study of current magnitude and frequencies of up to 20.16 kHz for two overcurrent relays was performed and validated the variable frequency testbed and methodology.","Elsevier","","Oak Ridge National Lab.

"Redesigning capacity market to include flexibility via ramp constraints in high-renewable penetrated system","Fang, Xin; Hu, Qinran; Bo, Rui; Li, Fangxing","24 POWER TRANSMISSION AND DISTRIBUTION; flexibility; capacity market; wind power; solar power; generation investment; system reliability","Capacity markets can co-exist alongside the energy and ancillary markets to ensure the medium-term and long-term supply adequacy by remunerating the generation resources for their availability. With the substantially increasing deployment of renewable generation, the system needs more flexibility to quickly mitigate the variability and uncertainty caused by the renewable generation. However, the present capacity market model does not differentiate the flexibility of generating units, so it might not give appropriate pricing signals to more flexible units that are usually more expensive. This is particularly important considering the increasing penetration levels of renewable generation on the electric grid, which increases the need for flexible units. This paper proposes a novel capacity market model considering flexibility requirement (FR) under the high penetration levels of renewable generation. Therefore, the proposed model can give the market-clearing price (MCP) for not only peak load generation capacity but also flexibility requirement. Thus, flexible units will tend to receive more economic incentives than non-flexible units.

"Robust Predictive Control for Modular Solid-State Transformer With Reduced DC Link and Parameter Mismatch","Zheng, Liran; Kandula, Rajendra Prasad; Divan, Deepak","25 ENERGY STORAGE; 14 SOLAR ENERGY; 17 WIND ENERGY; 24 POWER TRANSMISSION AND DISTRIBUTION; 32 ENERGY CONSERVATION, CONSUMPTION, AND UTILIZATION; 42 ENGINEERING; Voltage and power balancing; multivariable digital control; model predictive control (MPC); sampled-data modeling; input-series output-parallel (ISOP); multilevel power electronic transformer (PET); stabilization; bifurcation and chaos; model predictive priority-shifting (MPPS)","This paper presents the analysis and implementation of a predictive control method for dc-link regulation and voltage balance in a cascaded modular reduced dc-link solid-state transformer (SST). Passive components like bulky dc links limit the power density of power converters, especially medium-voltage (MV) SST. Reduced dc-link or low-inertia converters can dramatically reduce the size, cost, and weight by tolerating larger dc-link ripples and improve the reliability with electrolytic capacitor-less dc link. However, a small dc link leads to tight coupling between the input and the output stages, which is a challenge for control design. In stacked low-inertia converters (SLIC), the low-inertia converter modules are stacked for MV applications, resulting in coupling between the modules and making the control more challenging. A new model predictive control method which can achieve deadbeat regulation on the dc link without weighting factors has been proposed to address this novel problem. This paper focuses on analyzing the condition of the low-inertia dc link up to 80% ripple, the robustness of the control under parameter mismatches, high-order terms, and important implementation issues such as model-based sampling and computation delay compensation. Significantly, the high-order terms are introduced because of the large dc-link ripple. These high-order terms are unique to the SLIC and negligible in conventional high-inertia converters. A discrete-time large-signal model is built to capture the dc-link’s nonlinear dynamics, and the eigenvalues of a small-signal Jacobian matrix are analyzed with Floquet theory to evaluate stability, using the modular soft-switching solid-state transformer (M-S4T) as an example of the SLIC. Simulation and experimental results of an MVDC M-S4T verify the analysis and the predictive control method. Finally, the general application of the predictive control to low-inertia converters is compared against a conventional PI controller using a reduced dc-link active-front-end (AFE) rectifier as an example.","IEEE","","Georgia Institute of Technology, Atlanta, GA (United States)","USDOE Office of Energy Efficiency and Renewable Energy (EERE)","","United States","2021-06-01T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: IEEE Transactions on Power Electronics; Journal Volume: 36; Journal Issue: 12","","Medium: ED; Size: p. 14295-14311","","","EE0006521","Journal ID: ISSN 0885-8993","10.1109/tpel.2021.3085679","","2022-10-26T00:00:00Z","1894262","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/1894262","https://www.osti.gov/servlets/purl/1894262","IEEE Transactions on Power Electronics","12","36"

Assessing and maintaining RA is becoming more challenging due to increasing coal plant retirements, penetration of wind and solar resources, reliance on bilateral and market transactions, and emerging technologies. RA evaluation and planning have traditionally been conducted by utilities and overseen by their state regulators using integrated resource planning (IRP) processes. However, the Northwest Power Pool (NWPP) is developing a proposal for a regional RA program in the Western U.S. that would set and enforce capacity obligations for member utilities, and achieve RA more cost-effectively by pooling resources and load profiles from across the region. In this paper, we investigate the policy implications of a regional RA program for existing IRP regulations, with the proposed NWPP RA program as our main object of study. We compile the RA assessment practices of Western U.S. utilities, the proposed NWPP RA program design, and lessons from the historical experience of the Southwest Power Pool's RA program. Our analysis reveals that the IRP components which would be most heavily impacted by the regional program are RA targets, load forecasts, capacity accreditation factors, and transmission upgrades. We conclude by discussing the policy issues that RA program design and state IRP policy would have to address.","Elsevier","","Lawrence Berkeley National Lab.

The proposed approach decomposes the feeder-level DSSE into subarea-level estimation problems that can be solved independently. The proposed method is decentralized pruned physics-aware neural network (D-P2N2). The physical grid topology is used to parsimoniously design the connections between different hidden layers of the D-P2N2. Monte Carlo simulations based on one-year of load consumption data collected from smart meters for a three-phase distribution system power flow are developed to generate the measurement and voltage state data. The IEEE 123-node system is selected as the test network to benchmark the proposed algorithm against the classic weighted least squares and state-of-the-art learning-based DSSE approaches.

Although reservoirs buffer natural hydrologic variability, severe droughts can deplete storage below critical thresholds, or to levels at which the effluent water temperature exceeds the environmental compliance requirement for cooling. This study explores the effects of projected climate change and drought on water storage at 30 major reservoirs in Texas. These reservoirs collectively provide cooling water for about two thirds of thermoelectric power capacity in the Electric Reliability Council of Texas (ERCOT) power grid. Multi-ensemble runoff projections generated from eleven downscaled hydroclimate simulations are mapped to key watersheds to create spatially correlated multi-reservoir inflow sequences. These data are used to drive reservoir storage simulations, which are linked to a metric of “capacity-at-risk” using critical reservoir thresholds. We find that projected impacts of climate change are mixed, with results indicating an increase in the occurrence of thermal disruption under only half of climate models. A critical threshold of 30% storage volume—applied to all reservoirs—results in disruption to about one fifth of ERCOT thermal generation during the most severe projected droughts. The study highlights an important role for detailed reservoir behavior simulations for capturing the effects of drought and climate change on thermoelectric plant performance.","Elsevier","","National Renewable Energy Lab.

"Systematic planning of moving target defence for maximising detection effectiveness against false data injection attacks in smart grid","Liu, Bo; Wu, Hongyu","24 POWER TRANSMISSION AND DISTRIBUTION","Moving target defence (MTD) has been gaining traction to thwart false data injection attacks against state estimation (SE) in the power grid. MTD actively perturbs the reactance of transmission lines equipped with distributed flexible AC transmission system (D-FACTS) devices to falsify the attacker's knowledge about the system configuration. However, the existing literature has not systematically studied what influences the detection effectiveness of MTD and how it can be improved based on the topology analysis. These problems are tackled here from the perspective of an MTD plan in which the D-FACTS placement is determined. We first exploit the relation between the rank of the composite matrix and the detecting effectiveness. Then, we rigorously derive upper and lower bounds on the attack detecting probability of MTDs with a given rank of the composite matrix. Furthermore, we analyse existing planning methods and highlight the importance of bus coverage by D-FACTS devices. To improve the detection effectiveness, we propose a novel graph theory–based planning algorithm to retain the maximum rank of the composite matrix while covering all necessary buses. Comparative results on multiple systems show the high detecting effectiveness of the proposed algorithm in both DC- and AC-SE.","Institution of Engineering and Technology (IET)","","Kansas State Univ., Manhattan, KS (United States)","USDOE Office of Energy Efficiency and Renewable Energy (EERE), Renewable Power Office.

We identify the rate of energy consumed, CO<sub>2</sub>, SO<sub>2</sub> and NO<sub>x</sub> emissions generated, and water used per MWh net electricity as well as employee wellbeing per unit MW capacity during electricity generation.

"Adaptive critic design-based reinforcement learning approach in controlling virtual inertia-based grid-connected inverters","Saadatmand, Sepehr; Shamsi, Pourya; Ferdowsi, Mehdi","24 POWER TRANSMISSION AND DISTRIBUTION; Engineering; Adaptive critic design; Approximate dynamic programming; DC/AC converters; Heuristic dynamic programming; Machine learning; Reinforcement learning; Virtual inertia; Synchronverter","In this report, an adaptive critic design (ACD) approach is proposed to control the phase and voltage of a grid-connected virtual synchronous generator (VSG). The penetration of fast responding inertia-less power converters significantly affect the stability of the power system, especially weak systems such as micro grids. The concept of virtual inertia addresses this concern by virtually emulating the behavior of a synchronous generator. However, the conventional VSG is designed based on two conditions: (i) fixed operating point and (ii) inductive grid connections. The performance of VSGs in low-voltage semi-resistive microgrids is far from optimal. To overcome the aforementioned concerns, a heuristic dynamic programing (HDP) approach is proposed to optimally control grid-connected VSGs. The neural-network-based inherence of the HDP enables the proposed technique to adapt to any impedance angle. The HDP controller includes two subnetworks: (i) the action network that controls the system optimally and (ii) the critic network, which evaluates the effectiveness of the action network. The simulation and experimental results are provided to evaluate the effectiveness of the proposed technique. As shown, the HDP-based approach illustrates a better performance in comparison with the conventional PI-based VSG in various operating conditions.","Elsevier","","Univ. of Missouri, Columbia, MO (United States)","USDOE Office of Energy Efficiency and Renewable Energy (EERE)","","United States","2021-05-01T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: International Journal of Electrical Power and Energy Systems; Journal Volume: 127; Journal Issue: C","","Medium: ED; Size: Article No. 106657","","","EE0008449","Journal ID: ISSN 0142-0615; PII: S0142061520342022","10.1016/j.ijepes.2020.106657","","2022-06-30T00:00:00Z","1848798","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/1848798","https://www.osti.gov/servlets/purl/1848798","International Journal of Electrical Power and Energy Systems","C","127"

Changes in demand profiles require improvements in distribution system load models, which have not historically accounted for device controllability or impacts on customer comfort. Although building modeling research has focused on these features, there is a need to incorporate them into distribution load models that include DERs and can be used to study grid-interactive buildings. In this paper, we present the Object-oriented, Controllable, High-resolution Residential Energy (OCHRE) model. OCHRE is a controllable thermal-electric residential energy model that captures building thermal dynamics, integrates grid-dependent electrical behavior, contains models for common DERs and end-use loads, and simulates at a time resolution down to 1 minute. It includes models for space heaters, air conditioners, water heaters, electric vehicles, photovoltaics, and batteries that are externally controllable and integrated in a co-simulation framework. Using a proposed zero energy ready community in Colorado, we co-simulate a distribution grid and 498 all-electric homes with a diverse set of efficiency levels and equipment properties. We show that controllable devices can reduce peak demand within a neighborhood by up to 73% during a critical peak period without sacrificing occupant comfort. We also demonstrate the importance of modeling load diversity at a high time resolution when quantifying power and voltage fluctuations across a distribution system.","Elsevier","","National Renewable Energy Lab.

"Optimal Planning and Operation of Hidden Moving Target Defense for Maximal Detection Effectiveness","Liu, Bo; Wu, Hongyu","24 POWER TRANSMISSION AND DISTRIBUTION; False data injection attacks; hidden moving target defense; state estimation; D-FACTS; ACOPF","Moving target defense (MTD) in the power system is a promising defense strategy to detect false data injection (FDI) attacks against state estimation using distributed flexible AC transmission system (D-FACTS) devices. A hidden MTD (HMTD) is a superior MTD method, as it is stealthy to sophisticated attackers. However, the optimal planning and operation of D-FACTS devices that ensure the MTD hiddenness and maximal detection effectiveness are challenging yet unresolved issues. Here, we tackle these challenges by first deriving a novel hiddenness operation condition. Then, we propose an analytical sufficient condition on the D-FACTS placement for HMTDs using a graph-theory-based topology analysis. A depth-first-searchbased D-FACTS placement algorithm is proposed to guarantee the MTD hiddenness while maximizing the rank of its composite matrix, i.e., an indicator of the MTD effectiveness, and covering all necessary buses. Additionally, we propose DC- and ACHMTD operation models to determine the setpoints of D-FACTS devices. The optimization-based DC-HMTD model overcomes the drawbacks of the existing HMTD operation. The ACOPFbased HMTD operation model minimizes the generation cost to utilize the economic benefit of D-FACTS devices. Comparative numerical results on the IEEE 14-bus and IEEE 57-bus systems show the efficacy of the proposed planning and operation approaches.","IEEE","","Kansas State Univ., Manhattan, KS (United States)","USDOE Office of Energy Efficiency and Renewable Energy (EERE), Renewable Power Office.

A key advantage of this topology is the reduced voltage rating of the switches, though also makes it vulnerable to device failure during short-circuit conditions. Despite large interest in fault-tolerant operation of these converters, alongside detailed descriptions of flying capacitor balancing, little research has focused on the converter short-circuit fault analysis, which may cause a switch failure if not properly designed for. Therefore, this work presents a comprehensive model describing the large- signal short-circuit switching behavior of a general N -level flying- capacitor multilevel converter. Highly simplified models used to predict the evolution of the switch current and voltage stress during the fault are proposed, targeted at practicing engineers for conservative design guidelines. These models are used to determine the critical time for remedial action of the converter before reaching some predefined maximum conditions. A 2-to-10- level fully-configurable flying-capacitor multilevel converter and a fault circuit hardware prototype are used to experimentally perform different short-circuit tests that show a good match to the measured behavior.","IEEE","","Power Integration Laboratory, LLC, Alameda, CA (United States)","USDOE Office of Energy Efficiency and Renewable Energy (EERE)","","United States","2021-04-26T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: IEEE Transactions on Power Electronics; Journal Volume: 36; Journal Issue: 11","","Medium: ED; Size: p. 12292-12308","","","EE0008138","Journal ID: ISSN 0885-8993","10.1109/tpel.2021.3075447","","2022-06-10T00:00:00Z","1870980","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/1870980","https://www.osti.gov/servlets/purl/1870980","IEEE Transactions on Power Electronics","11","36"

"Extracting Resilience Metrics From Distribution Utility Data Using Outage and Restore Process Statistics","Carrington, Nichelle'Le K.; Dobson, Ian; Wang, Zhaoyu","24 POWER TRANSMISSION AND DISTRIBUTION; Power distribution reliability; data analysis; statistics; resilience; power system restoration","Resilience curves track the accumulation and restoration of outages during an event on an electric distribution grid. We show that a resilience curve generated from utility data can always be decomposed into an outage process and a restore process and that these processes generally overlap in time. We use many events in real utility data to characterize the statistics of these processes, and derive formulas based on these statistics for resilience metrics such as restore duration, customer hours not served, and outage and restore rates. The formulas express the mean value of these metrics as a function of the number of outages in the event. We also give a formula for the variability of restore duration, which allows us to predict a maximum restore duration with 95% confidence. Overall, we give a simple and general way to decompose resilience curves into outage and restore processes and then show how to use these processes to extract resilience metrics from standard distribution system data.","IEEE","","Iowa State Univ., Ames, IA (United States)","USDOE","","United States","2021-04-21T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: IEEE Transactions on Power Systems; Journal Volume: 36; Journal Issue: 6","","Medium: ED; Size: p. 5814-5823","","","OE0000875","Journal ID: ISSN 0885-8950","10.1109/tpwrs.2021.3074898","","2023-03-17T00:00:00Z","1961216","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/1961216","https://www.osti.gov/servlets/purl/1961216","IEEE Transactions on Power Systems","6","36"

There is a great need for novel protective relaying methods that enable the application of protection coordination on microgrids, thereby allowing for microgrids with larger areas and numbers of loads while not compromising reliable power delivery. Tools for modeling and analyzing such microgrids under fault conditions are necessary in order to help design such protective relaying and operate microgrids in a configuration that can be protected, though there is currently a lack of tools applicable to inverter-interfaced microgrids. This paper introduces the concept of applying an optimization problem formulation to the topic of inverter-interfaced microgrid fault modeling, and discusses how it can be employed both for simulating short-circuits and as a set of constraints for optimal microgrid operation to ensure protective device coordination.","MDPI AG","","Los Alamos National Lab.

Linear topological constraints are proposed to ensure radial topology after N-k contingencies, possibly in multiple islands. The approach is made comprehensive by considering dispatchable distributed energy resources (DERs), non-dispatchable DERs, and demand responses, as well as on-load tap changers (OLTCs) and shunt capacitors. The goal is to minimize the accumulative expense caused by load reduction payment or penalty, as well as DER operation cost. As a result, the overall system will survive longer with higher resilience during an extreme event. To verify the effectiveness of the PEER algorithm, we proposed a resilience evaluation algorithm using Monte Carlo simulation (MCS) with reduced scenarios. This is based on a probabilistic model for generating random scenarios which consider the uncertainty of line faults and solar irradiance. Combined with the proposed PEER algorithm, this reduced-scenario MCS can evaluate the expected energy not served (EENS) which is an essential index for distribution system resilience. Case studies of the IEEE 33-bus and 123-bus test systems validate the proposed algorithm in reducing EENS.","Elsevier","","Oak Ridge National Lab.

"The flexibility gap: Socioeconomic and geographical factors driving residential flexibility","Ribó-Pérez, David; Heleno, Miguel; Álvarez-Bel, Carlos","24 POWER TRANSMISSION AND DISTRIBUTION; Residential flexibility; Energy inequality; Energy transition; Spain","Residential consumers are moving to the center of electricity systems and their flexibility is seen as a key resource to integrate renewable energy sources and support the grid. However, residential flexibility capacities are not homogeneous, as they depend on household appliances, comfort patterns, occupancy, and climate conditions. In this work, we calculate the technical flexibility capacities of 45 consumer types in mainland Spain, organised according to income and regional criteria. We show that flexibility gaps exist at both regional and socioeconomic (income) levels with flexibility differences of up to 10 times more capacity between the household groups from the lowest to the highest capacities. These geographical and socioeconomic gaps in flexibility can lead to distortions in national markets and have the potential to exclude citizens from the provision of flexibility services. Our results show in quantitative terms that a consumer-centered approach without considering correcting measures nor these gaps in drafting energy policies may lead to increasing inequality levels in the residential sector. Under an economic competitive paradigm, households with lower income levels or located in regions with lower flexibility potential may be excluded from the provision of flexibility to the detriment of households with larger potential, raising justice concerns in a flexibility-based energy transition.","Elsevier","","Lawrence Berkeley National Lab.

"Framework for optimization of long-term, multi-period investment planning of integrated urban energy systems","van Beuzekom, Iris; Hodge, Bri-Mathias; Slootweg, Han","24 POWER TRANSMISSION AND DISTRIBUTION; mixed-integer linear optimization; investment planning; integrated energy systems; climate policy; facility location network design","In order to achieve stringent greenhouse gas emission reductions, a transition of our entire energy system from fossil to renewable resources needs to be designed. Such an energy transition brings two main challenges: most renewables generate variable electric energy, yet most demand is currently not electric (carrier mismatch) and does not always manifest at the same time as supply (temporal mismatch). Integrating multiple energy infrastructures can address both challenges by using the synergy between different energy carriers; building on existing infrastructure, while allowing a robust and flexible integration of the new. This paper proposes an optimization framework for long-term, multi-period investment planning of urban energy systems in an integrated manner. We formulate it as a mixed-integer linear program, combining a capacitated facility location with a multi-dimensional, capacitated network design problem. It includes generation and network expansion planning as well as interconnections between networks and storage infrastructure for each energy system. It can incorporate pathway effects like techno-economic developments, policy measures, and weather variations. The intended use is to support urban decision makers with long-term investment planning, though it can be tailored to fit other geographical or temporal scales. We demonstrate the model using two cases based on an average city in The Netherlands, which wants to reduce its CO<sub>2</sub>-emissions with 95% by 2050. In the first case, we include explicit carbon-emission constraints to study the effects of the carrier mismatch. In the second case, we implement interannual weather variations to analyze the temporal mismatch. The results give valuable insights into the energy transition design strategy for urban decision makers. They also show the future potential, as well as the computational challenges of the optimization framework.","Elsevier","","National Renewable Energy Lab.

"A two-stage service restoration method for electric power distribution systems","Poudel, Shiva; Dubey, Anamika","24 POWER TRANSMISSION AND DISTRIBUTION; electric power distribution systems; FLISR; ADMS; distributed generators","Improving the reliability of power distribution systems is critically important for both utilities and customers. This calls for an efficient service restoration module within a distribution management system to support the implementation of self-healing smart grid networks. Although the emerging smart grid technologies, including distributed generators (DGs) and remote-controlled switches, enhance the self-healing capability and allow faster recovery, they still pose additional complexity to the service restoration problem, especially under cold load pickup (CLPU) conditions. Herein, a novel two-stage restoration framework is proposed to generate a restoration solutions with a sequence of control actions. The first stage generates a restoration plan that supports both the traditional service restoration using feeder reconfiguration and the grid-forming DG-assisted intentional islanding methods. The second stage generates an optimal sequence of switching operations to bring the outaged system quickly to the final restored configuration. The problem is formulated as a mixed-integer linear program that incorporates system connectivity, operating constraints, and the CLPU models. It is demonstrated that on using a multi-feeder test case, the proposed framework is effective in utilizing all available resources to quickly restore the service and generate an optimal sequence of switching actions to be used by the operator to reach the desired optimal configuration.","The Institution of Engineering and Technology","","Pacific Northwest National Lab.

Among the many tasks of an aggregator, the task of managing the electricity consumption among a group of grid-interactive efficient buildings according to the demand on the grid is taken up. Specifically, here, the task of allocating a certain amount of power among the participating customers while respecting their preferences and comfort is considered. Modeling this as an aggregate flexibility, the virtual battery conditions that are employed to verify the feasibility of a candidate power profile are derived. A feasible power profile, when allocated, satisfies specified comfort bands. To determine the ideal power requirement of the loads, the model-free control method is employed. The feasible power profile is allocated by embedding the customers’ preferences through weights, posing the power constraint as a hyperplane, and employing a weighted projection from the ideal power requirements onto the constraint plane to solve the considered task. The proposed method is computationally efficient and scalable to any number of heterogeneous thermostatically controlled loads in buildings.","Elsevier","","Oak Ridge National Lab.

"How structural differences influence cross-model consistency: An electric sector case study","Cohen, Stuart M.; Iyer, Gokul C.; Brown, Maxwell; Macknick, Jordan; Wise, Marshall; Binsted, Matthew; Voisin, Nathalie; Rice, Jennie; Hejazi, Mohamad","24 POWER TRANSMISSION AND DISTRIBUTION; electricity; capacity expansion; modeling; multi-model; consistency; structural uncertainty; input harmonization; GCAM-USA; ReEDS","Multiple models are often employed to examine a range of possible outcomes for one or more scenarios, yielding insights into causal relationships and their uncertainties. Electric sector capacity expansion scenarios are commonly explored in such efforts due to the electric sector's overall economic importance, but multi-model results typically span a broad solution space despite efforts to harmonize input assumptions, making decision implications difficult to discern. This study investigates the relationship between efforts to harmonize input assumptions across multiple models and the resulting consistency of model outputs under different electric sector scenarios. We compare cross-model consistency between two electric sector capacity expansion models (GCAM-USA and ReEDS) for six electric sector scenarios with alternate assumptions about fossil fuel prices, technology innovation, and economy-wide transitions under four harmonization configurations that vary model representations of electricity demand, fuel prices, renewable resources, and capacity retirements. These comparisons reveal that cross-model consistency can vary across scenarios under a given harmonization configuration, suggesting that harmonization efforts must often be scenario-specific to achieve comparable cross-model consistency. Harmonization does not always improve consistency due to complex interactions between input assumptions, harmonized features, and unharmonized features. However, thorough harmonization can reduce uncertainty bounds and reveal insights into what drives cross-model consistency between two or more models. This work provides researchers and decision makers with a framework to carefully consider tradeoffs between effort and impact of harmonization efforts within multi-model analysis activities.","Elsevier","","National Renewable Energy Lab.

Electric load profile characterization can generate useful information to enhance building energy modeling and provide metrics to represent patterns and variability of load profiles. Such characterizations can be used to identify changes to building electricity demand due to operations or faulty equipment and controls. In this study, we proposed a two-path approach to analyze high temporal resolution building electrical load profiles: (1) time-domain analysis and (2) frequency-domain analysis. Furthermore, the commonly adopted time-domain analysis can extract and quantify the distribution of key parameters characterizing load shape such as peak-base load ratio and morning rise time, while a frequency-domain analysis can identify major periodic fluctuations and quantify load variability. We implemented and evaluated both paths using whole-year 15-minute interval smart meter data of 188 commercial office building in Northern California. The results from these two paths are consistent with each other and complementary to represent full dynamics of load profiles. The time- and frequency-domain analyses can be used to enhance building energy modeling by: (1) providing more realistic assumptions about building operation schedules, and (2) validating the simulated electric load profiles using the developed variability metrics against the real building load data.","Elsevier","","National Renewable Energy Lab.

In contrast, more recent studies found that the distribution of cascades is bimodal resulting in either a very small blackout or a very large blackout, engulfing a finite fraction of the system. Here we reconcile the two approaches and investigate how the distribution of the blackouts changes with model parameters, including the tolerance criteria and the dynamic rules of failure of the overloaded lines during the cascade. Finally, we study the same problem for the Motter and Lai model and find similar results, suggesting that the physical laws of flow on the network are not as important as network topology, overload conditions, and dynamic rules of failure.","American Physical Society (APS)","","Siemens Corp., Washington, DC (United States)","USDOE Office of Energy Efficiency and Renewable Energy (EERE), Renewable Power Office.

The existing scalable D-OPF algorithms either use approximations that are not valid for an unbalanced power distribution system, or apply relaxation techniques to the nonlinear power flow equations that do not guarantee a feasible power flow solution. In this paper, we propose scalable D-OPF algorithms that simultaneously achieve optimal and feasible solutions by solving multiple iterations of approximate, or relaxed, D-OPF subproblems of low complexity. The first algorithm is based on a successive linear approximation of the nonlinear power flow equations around the current operating point, where the D-OPF solution is obtained by solving multiple iterations of a linear programming (LP) problem. The second algorithm is based on the relaxation of the nonlinear power flow equations as conic constraints together with directional constraints, which achieves optimal and feasible solutions over multiple iterations of a second-order cone programming (SOCP) problem. Finally, it is demonstrated that the proposed algorithms are able to reach an optimal and feasible solution while significantly reducing the computation time as compared to an equivalent NLPD-OPF model for the same distribution system.","IEEE","","Pacific Northwest National Lab.

However, the existing Si-based solutions cannot fulfill the requirements of a high-efficiency and robust converter for MVDC grids. This paper presents a 5 kV SiC-based universal modular solid-state transformer (SST). This universal current-source SST can interface either a LVAC or LVDC grid with a MVDC grid in single-stage power conversion, while the conventional dual active bridge (DAB) converter needs an additional inverter. The proposed SST module using 3.3 kV SiC MOSFETs and diodes is bidirectional and can serve as a building block in series or parallel for higher-voltage higher-power systems. The topology of each module is based on the soft-switching solid-state transformer (S4T) with reduced conduction loss, which features reduced EMI through controlled dv/dt, and high efficiency with full-range ZVS for main devices and ZCS for auxiliary devices. Operation principle of the modular S4T (M-S4T), capacitor voltage balancing control between the cascaded modules, design of components including a medium-voltage (MV) medium-frequency transformer (MFT) to realize a 50 kVA 5 kV DC to 600 V DC or 480 V AC M-S4T are presented. Importantly, the MV MFT prototype achieves very low leakage inductance (0.13%) and 15 kV insulation with coaxial cables and nanocrystalline cores. Here, the proposed universal modular SST is compared against the DAB solution and verified with DC-DC and DC-AC simulation and 4 kV experimental results. Significantly, the MV experimental results of a modular DC transformer with each module at MVDC are rarely covered in the literature and reported for the first time.","IEEE","","Georgia Institute of Technology, Atlanta, GA (United States)","USDOE Office of Energy Efficiency and Renewable Energy (EERE)","","United States","2021-03-17T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: IEEE Transactions on Power Electronics; Journal Volume: 36; Journal Issue: 10","","Medium: ED; Size: p. 11326-11343","","","EE0006521","Journal ID: ISSN 0885-8993","10.1109/tpel.2021.3066908","","2022-10-26T00:00:00Z","1894263","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/1894263","https://www.osti.gov/servlets/purl/1894263","IEEE Transactions on Power Electronics","10","36"
"Transmission Capacity Allocation in Zonal Electricity Markets","Aravena, Ignacio; Lété, Quentin; Papavasiliou, Anthony; Smeers, Yves","24 POWER TRANSMISSION AND DISTRIBUTION","In this work, we propose a novel framework for modeling zonal electricity markets, based on projecting the constraints of the nodal network onto the space of the zonal aggregation of the network. The framework avoids circular definitions and discretionary parameters, which are recurrent in the implementation and study of zonal markets. Using this framework, we model and analyze two zonal market designs currently present in Europe: flow-based market coupling (FBMC) and available-transfer-capacity market coupling (ATCMC). We develop cutting-plane algorithms for simulating FBMC and ATCMC while accounting for the robustness of imports/exports to single element failures, and we conduct numerical simulations of FBMC and ATCMC on a realistic instance of the Central Western European system under the equivalent of 100 years of operating conditions. We find that FBMC and ATCMC are unable to anticipate the congestion of branches interconnecting zones and branches within zones and that both zonal designs achieve similar overall cost efficiencies (0.01% difference), whereas a nodal market design largely outperforms both of them (5.09% better than FBMC). These findings raise the question of whether it is worth it for more European countries to switch from ATCMC to FBMC, instead of advancing directly toward a nodal market design.","INFORMS","External Audience (Unlimited)","Lawrence Livermore National Lab.

Specifically, a novel, provably-tight, convex relaxation of the AC optimal power flow (OPF) problem is presented to optimally dispatch the VBs to track the feeder’s desired power trajectory. In addition to the optimal VB dispatch scheme, a real-time, corrective control scheme is designed, which is based on optimal proportional-integral (PI) control with anti-windup, to reject intra-feeder and inter-feeder disturbances that arise during operation of the power system.

It is not clear if the sequence impedance has a reference frame similar to the dq impedance. If so, the role of the grid voltage angle estimation in aligning the sequence impedance reference frame has not been discussed. Additionally, existing methods for measuring the sequence impedance with frequency coupling are complicated, are not feasible for large wind turbines and inverters, and provide the sequence impedance responses in only either MIMO or SISO form. This paper presents a sequence impedance measurement method that considers the frequency coupling, performs reference frame alignment, demonstrates the impact of the grid voltage angle estimation, and obtains the sequence impedance response in both MIMO and SISO forms.

Since occupant activities and preferences primarily drive the availability and operational flexibility of building devices, there is a critical need to develop occupant-centric approaches that prioritize devices for providing grid services, while maintaining the desired end-use quality of service. In this paper, we present a decision-making framework that facilitates a building owner/operator to effectively prioritize loads for curtailment service under uncertainties, while minimizing any adverse impact on the occupants. The proposed framework uses a stochastic (Markov) model to represent the probabilistic behavior of device usage from power consumption data, and a load prioritization algorithm that dynamically ranks building loads using a stochastic multi-criteria decision-making algorithm. The proposed load prioritization framework is illustrated via numerical simulations in a residential building use-case, including plug-loads, air-conditioners, and plug-in electric vehicle chargers, in the context of load curtailment as a grid service. Suitable metrics are proposed to evaluate the closed-loop performance of the proposed prioritization algorithm under various scenarios and design choices. Scalability of the proposed algorithm is established via computational analysis, while time-series plots are used for intuitive explanation of the ranking choices.","ASME","","Pacific Northwest National Lab.

Wind and solar, along with battery energy storage systems, interface with the grid using power electronic inverters; hence, they are collectively referred to as inverter-based resources (IBRs). The increasing annual share of electricity from IBRs in a power system means that during more times of the year, the system will operate at a much higher concentration of IBRs. Figure 1 presents the hourly share of wind and solar generation in the Electric Reliability Council of Texas (ERCOT) system in Texas in 2019.

This article proposes a hierarchical power flow control architecture that involves both transmission and distribution networks as well as individual buildings to enhance both small-signal rotor angle stability and frequency stability of the transmission network. The proposed architecture consists of a transmission-level optimizer enhancing system damping ratios, a distribution-level controller following transmission commands and providing frequency support, and a building-level scheduler accounting for quality of service and following the distribution-level targets.

Developing an efficient control strategy for inertia emulation and frequency response support of microgrids is becoming an important issue. Wind turbine dynamics, however, will degrade the emulated inertial and primary responses with most traditional control strategies. On the other hand, compensation methods often require the knowledge of system models at the design stage and state estimation for feedback once deployed online. To overcome these challenges, this paper explores a model-free control (MFC) strategy to emulate the desired inertia and support the frequency response of a diesel-wind microgrid system. Additionally, the proposed MFC strategy utilizes a model reference concept to obtain guaranteed inertial response and improve the frequency response of microgrids. This work considers different control strategies with different operating points. The proposed controller is implemented and verified using the modified 33-bus full nonlinear model of the three-phase diesel-wind system in Simulink. Simulation results demonstrate the improved frequency response by precisely emulating the desired inertia using the MFC strategy.","Elsevier","","Argonne National Lab.

This paper proposes an extended convex hull based method to address optimal energy flow problems for the integrated electricity and gas systems in a distributed manner. First, a multi-block electricity-gas system model is constructed by dividing the whole system into N blocks considering both physical and regional differences. This multi-block model is then convexified by replacing the nonconvex gas transmission equation with the extended convex hull-based constraints. The Jacobi-Proximal alternating direction method of multipliers algorithm is adopted to solve the convexified model and minimize its operation cost. Finally, the feasibility of the optimal solution for the convexified model is checked, and a sufficient condition is developed. If the sufficient condition is satisfied, the optimal solution for the original nonconvex problem can be recovered from that for the convexified problem. Simulation results demonstrate that the proposed method is tractable and effective in obtaining feasible optimal solutions for multi-block optimal energy flow problems.","Elsevier","","Univ. of Central Florida, Orlando, FL (United States)","USDOE Office of Energy Efficiency and Renewable Energy (EERE); National Science Foundation (NSF); National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC)","","United States","2021-02-10T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: Applied Energy; Journal Volume: 287; Journal Issue: C","","Medium: ED; Size: Article No. 116551","","","EE0007998; EE0009028; ECCS-1552073; T23-701/14-N; GRF17207818; 51677160","Journal ID: ISSN 0306-2619; PII: S0306261921000994","10.1016/j.apenergy.2021.116551","","2022-06-16T00:00:00Z","1848664","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/1848664","https://www.osti.gov/servlets/purl/1848664","Applied Energy","C","287"
"DC-Saturated Continuously Variable Series Reactors (CVSRs) for Power Flow Control in Power Transmission Systems","Zheng, Sheng; Wang, Jingxin; Wang, Fred; Tolbert, Leon M.","24 POWER TRANSMISSION AND DISTRIBUTION; windings; inductors; magnetic cores; legged locomotion; load flow; distortion; impedance; continuously variable series reactors; variable inductor; power flow control","This paper proposes a novel continuously variable series reactor (CVSR) based on a dc current controller (DCC) to manage power flow in transmission systems. There are three major contributions. First, the three-dimensional electromagnetic interaction has been comprehensively analyzed to extend the understanding beyond the conventional 2D relationship. Second, a high-fidelity reluctance model of the CVSR with an improved DCC model is proposed and implemented. To overcome the fundamental concern for the system modeling, the DCC has been modeled as an ideal current source in parallel with an output impedance. Additionally, the induced back-EMF can be precisely projected which provides critical design guidelines for the DCC. Third, inspired by the theoretical analysis and modeling, a reliable high power DCC converter is designed accordingly to interface with kV-level back-EMF and supply kA-level dc current for a 115 kV/1500 A CVSR. Experiments are conducted in a practical transmission demonstration system. When the ac current in the transmission system varies from zero to 1500 A, experimental results show that the proposed CVSR can continuously regulate the reactance from 1.6 Ω to 5 Ω, validating the effectiveness of the proposed system design and modeling methodology.","IEEE","","Oak Ridge National Lab.

An event-driven predictive approach for real-time volt/volt-ampere reactive (VAR) optimization, along with local two-level adaptive volt/VAR droop-based control algorithm for advanced distribution management systems, is introduced. The methodology covers aggregated and autonomous controls under different timescale operations, including the impact and effect of unpredicted events such as cloud transients on PV power production. In addition, the control schemes include the uncertainties in PV power generation and load power demand. The proposed methodology is validated in a real-time framework using the real-time digital simulator platform through co-simulation with models based on Python and OpenDSS (Open Distribution System Simulator). The developed methodology is tested on the modified IEEE 123-feeder test system.

Superior to the existing IMG self-restoration methods, the “conditionality” of the proposed CSR-EMS can economically realize self-restoration and grid-assisted restoration during energy deficiency or faults, in both islanded and grid-connected modes. Cost minimization is implemented as the objective function to judge in real-time which restoration mode is economically preferred. The proposed CSR-EMS comprises two layers–the lower layer operates locally to eliminate electricity fluctuations created by RESs and ensure economic effectiveness within an MG, whereas the upper layer oversees the real-time operational status of the IMG system and determines power exchange among microgrids (MGs) during abnormalities. In detail, when a microgrid inside the IMG system experiences an energy deficiency, the CSR-EMS, on an MPC basis, intelligently optimizes power production from each dispatchable distributed generator (DG), ESS, power imported from the main grid, and power exchange among the IMGs to maintain the demand–supply balance, while considering system recovery cost, state of charge (SoC) of ESSs and operation modes of the IMGs (i.e., grid-connected or islanded mode). Simulation results and comparisons with existing IMG self-healing EMSs demonstrate the economic efficacy of the proposed CSR-EMS strategy during normal and abnormal operations, which can be used as an energy control framework for modern power systems with multiple interconnected microgrids.","Elsevier","","National Renewable Energy Lab.

Vincent","24 POWER TRANSMISSION AND DISTRIBUTION; contactless sensing; cyber-enabled grid; energy grid; energy harvesting; internet of things; pervasive sensing; shielding","As the penetration of distributed energy resources based on renewable sources increases, several technical challenges are introduced into energy grids. These include real-time power balance, control of bi-directional energy flow, power quality, distributed optimization, state estimation and topology estimation in distribution grids, and multi-level electricity trading. To overcome these challenges and to create situational awareness in energy grids, pervasive sensing becomes essential. To overcome hurdles such as implementation and cost of such pervasive sensing, in addition to traditional contact-sensing methods, contactless sensors that can measure key variables in the grid needs to be leveraged. Contactless sensing enables measurement of process variables that may be hard to measure due to technological limitations of contact sensing, large measurement delays, or high costs. In addition to contactless sensing, pervasive sensing proves advantageous as it can leverage ongoing technological advances in Internet of Things (IoT), as they can lead to enhanced network connectivity between sensors as well as between the edge and the cloud. Finally, pervasive sensing proves even more attractive by integrating contactless sensing not only with wireless communication but also with shielding and energy harvesting. This paper reviews pervasive sensing techniques in power grids that encompass contactless sensing technologies, IoT connectivity, energy harvesting and shielding. In addition, we also explore how pervasive sensing in a Cyber-Enabled Grid (CEG) can contribute to the development roadmap of Autonomous Energy Grids (AEGs), a futuristic concept where the grid will be making automated operational decisions. The potential challenges and research opportunities in this pioneering research field such as data deluge, cybersecurity, and sensor fusion will be discussed. This review article, which addresses the role of pervasive sensing in CEGs, is a first of its kind. It will help engineers and scientists to understand its significant potential to shape future energy systems.","Elsevier","","National Renewable Energy Lab.

Compared to single-input single-output (SISO)-based controllers, the LQR-ORT controller increases robustness margins and reduces the quadratic value of the power error and control inputs during transient response. Supplementary loops are used to reduce frequency and voltage deviations in the ac bus without communications. The supplementary loop for voltage regulation is based on the droop controller by reducing direct and quadrature output voltages according to the active and reactive power demand. A model in a synchronous reference frame that integrates power sharing and voltage–current dynamics is also proposed. In addition, a methodology to develop an islanded microgrid model in a synchronous reference frame is proposed. Robustness analysis demonstrates stability of the LQR-ORT controller under variations in the frequency and the LCL filter components. Experimental results demonstrate accuracy of the proposed model and the effectiveness of the LQR-ORT controller on improving transient response and robustness in islanded mode.","Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers","","Univ. of Alaska, Fairbanks, AK (United States)","USDOE Office of Science (SC), Basic Energy Sciences (BES); USDOE Office of Energy Efficiency and Renewable Energy (EERE); USDOE Office of Electricity (OE)","","United States","2021-06-01T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: IEEE Transactions on Power Electronics Journal Volume: 36 Journal Issue: 6","","Medium: X; Size: p. 7112-7122","","","SC0020281","Journal ID: ISSN 0885-8993; 9250669","10.1109/TPEL.2020.3036594","","2021-12-20T00:00:00Z","1836301","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/1836301","","IEEE Transactions on Power Electronics","6","36"

An important element of TENs will be practical, accurate, and implementable residential load forecasting techniques. While there have been many approaches to short-term load forecasting, few have included forecasting for individual households, partly because the high volatility and idiosyncrasies present in individual household load data can pose significant challenges. In this study, we develop a Convolutional Long Short-Term Memory-based neural network with Selected Autoregressive Features (termed a CLSAF model) to improve short-term household electricity load forecasting accuracy by employing three strategies: autoregressive features selection, exogenous features selection, and a “default” state to avoid overfitting at times of high load volatility. We include aggregations of apartments to floor and building level, because utilities may favor transactive approaches that rely on aggregator models, e.g., a cluster of consumers as opposed to an individual. We demonstrate that the CLSAF model, by virtue of its enhanced feature representation and modest computational resources, can accomplish load forecasting in a multi-family residential building across three spatial granularities (individual apartment/household, floor, and building levels), with an accuracy improvement of up to 25% compared to a persistence model. We propose a data screening technique to characterize time-series electricity-load data. This technique is suitable for integration into a TEN ecosystem and allows one to estimate confidence levels of the load forecasts to optimize computational resources and the risks associated with uncertain forecasts.","Elsevier","","Univ. of Central Florida, Orlando, FL (United States)","USDOE Office of Energy Efficiency and Renewable Energy (EERE)","","United States","2021-02-01T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: Applied Energy; Journal Volume: 287; Journal Issue: C","","Medium: ED; Size: Article No. 116509","","","EE0007864; EE-0007864","Journal ID: ISSN 0306-2619; PII: S0306261921000672","10.1016/j.apenergy.2021.116509","","2022-06-16T00:00:00Z","1848596","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/1848596","https://www.osti.gov/servlets/purl/1848596","Applied Energy","C","287"

Under this new paradigm, first, EV and HVAC aggregator models are developed in this paper to represent the fleet of GEBs, in which the aggregated parameters are obtained based on a new approach of data generation and least squares parameter estimation (DG-LSPE), which can deal with heterogeneous HVACs. Then, a tri-level bidding and dispatching framework is established based on competitive distribution operation with distribution locational marginal price (DLMP). Furthermore, the first two levels form a bilevel model to optimize the aggregators’ payment and to represent the interdependency between load aggregators and the distribution system operator (DSO) using DLMP, and the third level is to dispatch the optimal load aggregation to all residents by the proposed priority list-based demand dispatching algorithm. Finally, case studies on a modified IEEE 33-Bus system illustrate three main technical reasons of payment reduction due to demand flexibility: load shift, DLMP step changes, and power losses.

Previous studies explored the addition of more flexible resources to improve system flexibility, but this may also be achieved at lower cost by enhancing existing power plants via flexibility retrofits. Potential flexibility upgrades to existing thermal plants include modifications that enable faster ramp rates, increase maximum load levels, decrease minimum load levels, and provide faster and lower cost startup operations. In this paper, we focus on improvements to existing natural gas combined cycle generators, and apply a unit commitment model to analyze the impact that each specific upgrade has on their operational dynamics and profitability from both the system perspective and from the asset owner perspective. We show that the value of each type of flexibility improvement varies depending on the capacity factor and usage pattern of the generator before the upgrade, and that the relative benefit of each type of flexibility varies. We demonstrate diminishing returns to increased flexibility when upgrading multiple generators simultaneously. Sensitivity tests for several shares of renewable generation, different generation mixes and different net load realizations confirm the generality of the results shown.","IEEE","","National Renewable Energy Lab.

One possible approach is to establish distribution-level electricity markets and allow devices/aggregations of devices to participate in price establishment. While this approach purports some of the same benefits as the highly successful wholesale electricity markets (i.e., open competition, efficient price discovery, reduced communication overhead), this needs to be researched and quantified via an analysis platform that models distribution-level markets at the appropriate fidelity. Specifically, the simultaneous evaluation of market performance, DER performance, DER bidding approaches, and distribution feeder power quality requires modeling that spans multiple technical areas. Co-simulation has emerged as a powerful tool in addressing this type of problem, where outputs depend on a range of underlying areas of expertise and associated models. In this paper we describe a solution, as implemented in the HELICS co-simulation platform, where we include (1) high fidelity house models, (2) intelligent bidding agents, (3) a modular market integration/design, and (4) a distribution feeder model. We then present a case study where we test two different market designs: (1) a pseudo-wholesale double-blind auction, and (2) an asynchronous matching market. In this work, the markets are run under two DER penetration levels and economic results are compared to full retail net energy metering and avoided cost net metering scenarios that bookend current approaches to remuneration of DER participation. We show the potential for transactive markets to provide increased value for most customers relative to net metering (and all customers relative to avoided cost scenarios) while decreasing costs for the utility.","Elsevier","","National Renewable Energy Lab.

Empirical validation necessary to enable best practices is becoming increasingly tractable. The growing prevalence of advanced metering infrastructure has led to significant data regarding the energy consumption within individual buildings, but is something utilities and countries are still struggling to analyze and use wisely. In partnership with the Electric Power Board of Chattanooga, Tennessee, a crude OpenStudio/EnergyPlus model of over 178,000 buildings has been created and used to compare simulated energy against actual, 15-min, whole-building electrical consumption of each building. In this study, classifying building type is treated as a use case for quantifying performance associated with smart meter data. This article attempts to provide guidance for working with advanced metering infrastructure for buildings related to: quality control, pathological data classifications, statistical metrics on performance, a methodology for classifying building types, and assess accuracy. Advanced metering infrastructure was used to collect whole-building electricity consumption for 178,333 buildings, define equations for common data issues (missing values, zeros, and spiking), propose a new method for assigning building type, and empirically validate gaps between real buildings and existing prototypes using industry-standard accuracy metrics.","MDPI","","Oak Ridge National Lab.

However, the high-granularity and non-stationary nature of PMU data and imperfect data quality could bring great technical challenges for real-time system event identification. To address these challenges, this paper proposes a two-stage learning-based framework. In the first stage, a Markov transition field (MTF) algorithm is exploited to extract the latent data features by encoding temporal dependency and transition statistics of PMU data in graphs. Then, a spatial pyramid pooling (SPP)-aided convolutional neural network (CNN) is established to efficiently and accurately identify power events. The proposed method fully builds on and is also tested on a large real-world dataset from several tens of PMU sources (and the corresponding event logs), located across the U.S., with a time span of two consecutive years. We report the numerical results validate that our method has high identification accuracy while showing good robustness against poor data quality.","IEEE","","Iowa State Univ., Ames, IA (United States)","USDOE Office of Electricity (OE)","","United States","2021-05-18T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: IEEE Transactions on Power Systems; Journal Volume: 36; Journal Issue: 6","","Medium: ED; Size: p. 5044-5055","","","OE0000910","Journal ID: ISSN 0885-8950; DEOE0000910","10.1109/tpwrs.2021.3081608","","2022-05-23T00:00:00Z","1866731","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/1866731","https://www.osti.gov/servlets/purl/1866731","IEEE Transactions on Power Systems","6","36"

However, because this model is typically nonlinear and large-scale, the analysis of its observability is a challenge to the traditional derivative-based methods. Indeed, the linear-approximation-based approach may provide unreliable results while the nonlinear-technique-based approach inevitably faces extremely complicated derivations. Furthermore, because power systems are intrinsically stochastic, the traditional deterministic approaches may lead to inaccurate observability analyses. In this work, facing these challenges, we propose a novel polynomial-chaos-based derivative-free observability analysis approach that not only is free of any linear approximations, but also accounts for the stochasticity of the dynamic model while bringing a low implementation complexity. Furthermore, this approach enables us to quantify the degree of observability of a stochastic model, what conventional deterministic methods cannot do. The excellent performance of the proposed method has been demonstrated by performing extensive simulations using a synchronous generator model with IEEE-DC1A exciter and the TGOV1 turbine governor.","IEEE","External Audience (Unlimited)","Lawrence Livermore National Lab.

"Parameter Reduction of Composite Load Model Using Active Subspace Method","Ma, Zixiao; Cui, Bai; Wang, Zhaoyu; Zhao, Dongbo","24 POWER TRANSMISSION AND DISTRIBUTION; WECC composite load model; active subspace; dimension reduction; parameter reduction","Over the past decades, the increasing penetration of distributed energy resources (DERs) has dramatically changed the power load composition in the distribution networks. The traditional static and dynamic load models can hardly capture the dynamic behavior of modern loads especially for fault-induced delayed voltage recovery (FIDVR) events. Thus, a more comprehensive composite load model with combination of static load, different types of induction motors, single-phase A/C motor, electronic load and DERs has been proposed by Western Electricity Coordinating Council (WECC). However, due to the large number of parameters and model complexity, the WECC composite load model (WECC CMLD) raises new challenges to power system studies. To overcome these challenges, in this paper, a cutting-edge parameter reduction (PR) approach for WECC CMLD based on active subspace method (ASM) is proposed. Firstly, the WECC CMLD is parameterized in a discrete-time manner for the application of the proposed method. Then, parameter sensitivities are calculated by discovering the active subspace, which is a lower-dimensional linear subspace of the parameter space of WECC CMLD in which the dynamic response is most sensitive. The interdependency among parameters can be taken into consideration by our approach. Finally, the numerical experiments validate the effectiveness and advantages of the proposed approach for WECC CMLD model.","IEEE","","Argonne National Lab.

The first approach fully exploits the property of monotonicity associated with the supply or demand curves of rational market participants. It only relies on the data that are normally exchanged through market interaction and does not require any extra information. Therefore, it can be easily adopted by existing system implementation. When the gradients of the supply (or demand) curves have positive lower (or negative upper) bounds, a second approach can be further developed for more accurate anomaly detection if the knowledge of these bounds become available. For both approaches, the impacts of power flow constraints are also taken into account. The detailed simulation studies illustrate the performance and effectiveness of the proposed approaches in detecting anomalies caused by cyberattacks.","Elsevier","","Oak Ridge National Lab.

The traditional approach of leveraging physical measurements for detecting cyber-induced physical contingencies is insufficient to reflect the accurate cyber-physical states. Moreover, deploying conventional rule-based and anomaly-based intrusion detection systems for cyberattack detection results in higher false positives. Hence, independent usage of detection tools of cyberattacks in cyber and physical sides has a limited capability. In this work, a mechanism to fuse real-time data from cyber and physical domains, to improve situational awareness of the whole system is developed. It is demonstrated how improved situational awareness can help reduce false positives in intrusion detection. This cyber and physical data fusion results in cyber-physical state space explosion which is addressed using different feature transformation and selection techniques. Our fusion engine is further integrated into a cyber-physical power system testbed as an application that collects cyber and power system telemetry from multiple sensors emulating real-world data sources found in a utility. These are synthesized into features for algorithms to detect cyber intrusions. Results are presented using the proposed data fusion application to infer False Data and Command Injection (FDI and FCI)-based Man-in-The-Middle attacks. Post collection, the data fusion application uses time-synchronized merge and extracts features. This is followed by pre-processing such as imputation, categorical encoding, and feature reduction, before training supervised, semi-supervised, and unsupervised learning models to evaluate the performance of the intrusion detection system. A major finding is the improvement of detection accuracy by fusion of features from cyber, security, and physical domains. Additionally, it is observed that the semi-supervised co-training technique performs at par with supervised learning methods with the proposed feature vector. The approach and toolset, as well as the dataset that is generated can be utilized to prevent threats such as false data or command injection attacks from being carried out by identifying cyber intrusions accurately.","Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers","","Texas A & M Univ., College Station, TX (United States).

Low-inertia converters, featuring small electrolytic capacitor-less dc links, dramatically reduce cost, size, and weight compared to conventional solutions. However, without a large dc-link buffer, the input and output are tightly coupled, leading to significant control challenges. The control becomes even more challenging with these converters stacked input-series output-parallel (ISOP) for medium-voltage (MV) grid, which causes coupling between the modules besides the coupling within each module. This paper analyzes the multi-objective, multi-degree of freedom control problem, using the modular soft-switching solid-state transformer (M-S4T) as an example of the SLIC. First, distribution of control efforts under controller saturation is critical because multiple control objectives can be conflicting, especially when the module voltages are unbalanced and are being restored. The MPPS can shift the priorities to address this issue. Second, due to the low inertia and high dc-link ripple, classic space vector pulse-width modulation (SVPWM), average model with small-ripple assumption, and control design based on small-signal model cannot accurately modulate, model, and control the nonlinear reduced dc link. Therefore, a discrete-time large-signal model of the M-S4T is established to derive the predictive control in the MPPS. The MPPS and the PI control are compared in MV simulations to show the issue of applying the PI to the SLIC and the effectiveness of the MPPS for voltage balancing and dc-link regulation in a deadbeat manner. Finally, the proposed control is tested on a 5 kV ISOP SiC SST prototype to verify priority shifting to address controller saturation issue and fast and robust voltage balancing.","IEEE","","Georgia Institute of Technology, Atlanta, GA (United States)","USDOE Office of Energy Efficiency and Renewable Energy (EERE)","","United States","2021-01-08T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: IEEE Transactions on Power Electronics; Journal Volume: 36; Journal Issue: 8","","Medium: ED; Size: p. 8934-8952","","","EE0006521","Journal ID: ISSN 0885-8993","10.1109/tpel.2021.3050115","","2022-10-27T00:00:00Z","1894261","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/1894261","https://www.osti.gov/servlets/purl/1894261","IEEE Transactions on Power Electronics","8","36"

"Voltage Estimation in Low-Voltage Distribution Grids with Distributed Energy Resources","Markovic, Marija; Sajadi, Amirhossein; Florita, Anthony; Cruickshank III, Robert; Hodge, Bri-Mathias","24 POWER TRANSMISSION AND DISTRIBUTION; cable television network; distributed photovoltaics; low-voltage estimation; random forests; secondary distribution system","Present distribution grids generally have limited sensing capabilities and are therefore characterized by low observability. Improved observability is a prerequisite for increasing the hosting capacity of distributed energy resources such as solar photovoltaics (PV) in distribution grids. In this context, this paper presents learning-aided low-voltage estimation using untapped but readily available and widely distributed sensors from cable television (CATV) networks. The cable broadband sensors offer timely local voltage magnitude sensing with 5-minute resolution and can provide an order of magnitude more data on the time-varying state of a secondary distribution system than currently deployed utility sensors. The proposed solution incorporates voltage readings from neighboring CATV sensors, taking into account spatio-temporal aspects of the observations, and estimates single-phase voltage magnitudes at all non-monitored low-voltage buses using random forests. The effectiveness of the proposed approach was demonstrated using a multi-phase 1572-bus feeder from the SMART-DS data set for two case studies passive distribution feeder (without PV) and active distribution feeder (with PV). The analysis was conducted on simulated data, and the results show voltage estimates with a high degree of accuracy, even at extremely low percentages of observable nodes.","IEEE","","National Renewable Energy Lab.

"Optimized allocation method of the VSC-MTDC system for frequency regulation reserves considering the cost","Sun, Kaiqi; Xiao, Huangqing; Liu, Yilu","24 POWER TRANSMISSION AND DISTRIBUTION; VSC-MTDC; frequency regulation control; response reserve classification; optimized reserve allocation","In recent years, the interconnection of asynchronous power grids through the VSC-MTDC system has been proposed and extensively studied in light of the potential benefits of economical bulk power exchanges and frequency regulation reserves sharing. This paper proposed an optimized allocation method for sharing frequency regulation reserves among the interconnected power systems and the corresponding frequency regulation control of the VSC-MTDC system under emergency frequency deviation events. Firstly, the frequency regulation reserve classification is proposed. In the classification, the available frequency response capacity reserves of each interconnection are divided into commercial reserves and regular reserves. While the commercial reserves are procured through long-term contracts, the regular reserves are purchased based on market prices of frequency regulation services. Secondly, based on the proposed frequency regulation reserve classification, a novel frequency regulation control is then introduced for the VSC-MTDC system. This control method could minimize the costs of the disturbed power grid for the needed frequency response supports from the other power grids. Simulation verifications are performed on a modified IEEE 39 bus system and a highly reduced power system model representing the North American grids. The simulation verification indicates that the developed frequency regulation control significantly reduced ancillary service costs of the disturbed power grid.","Chinese Society for Electrical Engineering (CSEE)","","Oak Ridge National Lab.

In the first stage, residential customers determine the operating status of their responsive devices such as heating, ventilation, and air conditioning (HVAC) systems and electric water heaters (EWHs), while the distribution system operator (DSO) computes the amount of electricity to be purchased in the day-ahead electricity market. In the second stage, the DSO purchases insufficient (or sells surplus) electricity in the real-time electricity market to maintain the supply-demand balance. Due to its computational complexity and data privacy issues, the proposed model cannot be directly solved in a centralized manner, especially with a large number of uncertain scenarios. Therefore, this paper proposes a combination of stochastic programming (SP) and the alternating direction method of multipliers (ADMM) algorithm, called SP-ADMM, to decompose the original model and then solve each sub-problem in a distributed manner while considering multiple uncertain scenarios. The simulation study is performed on the IEEE 33-bus system including 121 residential houses. Here, the results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed approach for large-scale residential DR applications under weather and consumer uncertainties.","IEEE","","Oak Ridge National Lab.

Interest in integrated T&D modeling is driven by the changes taking place in power systems worldwide that are resulting in more decentralized power systems with increasingly high levels of distributed energy resources. Additionally, the increasing role of the hitherto passive energy consumer in the management and operation of power systems requires more capable and detailed integrated T&D modeling to understand the interactions between T&D systems. Although integrated T&D modeling has not yet found widespread commercial application, its potential for changing the decades-old power system modeling approaches has led to several research efforts in the last few years that tried to (i) develop algorithms and software for steady-state and dynamic modeling of power systems and (ii) demonstrate the advantages of this modeling approach compared with traditional, separated T&D system modeling. In this paper, we provide a review of integrated T&D modeling research efforts and the methods employed for steady-state and dynamic modeling of power systems. We also discuss our current research in integrated T&D modeling and the potential directions for future research. This paper should be useful for power systems researchers and industry members because it will provide them with a critical summary of current research efforts and the potential topics where research efforts are needed to further advance and demonstrate the utility of integrated T&D modeling.","MDPI AG","","National Renewable Energy Lab.

"CRISPR-Cas “Non-Target” Sites Inhibit On-Target Cutting Rates","Moreb, Eirik A.; Hutmacher, Mitchell; Lynch, Michael D.","24 POWER TRANSMISSION AND DISTRIBUTION; Cas9; cutting rates; specificity; non-target; search space","CRISPR-Cas systems have become ubiquitous for genome editing in eukaryotic as well as bacterial systems. Cas9 forms a complex with a guide RNA (gRNA) and searches DNA for a matching sequence (target site) next to a protospacer adjacent motif (PAM). Once found, Cas9 cuts the DNA. Cas9 is revolutionary for the ability to change the RNA sequence and target a new site easily. However, while algorithms have been developed to predict gRNA-specific Cas9 activity, a fundamental biological understanding of gRNA-specific activity is lacking. Here, the number of PAM sites in the genome is effectively a large pool of inhibitory substrates, competing with the target site for the Cas9/gRNA complex. We demonstrate that increasing the number of non-target sites for a given gRNA reduces on-target activity in a dose-dependent manner. Furthermore, we show that the use of Cas9 mutants with increased PAM specificity toward a smaller subset of PAMs (or smaller pool of competitive substrates) improves cutting rates, while increased PAM promiscuity decreases cutting rates. Decreasing the potential search space by increasing PAM specificity provides a path toward improving on-target activity for slower high-fidelity Cas9 variants. Engineering improved PAM specificity to reduce the competitive search space offers an alternative strategy to engineer Cas9 variants with increased specificity and maintained on-target activity.","Mary Ann Liebert, Inc.","","Duke Univ., Durham, NC (United States)","USDOE Office of Energy Efficiency and Renewable Energy (EERE), Transportation Office.

Accurate detection of events is crucial for situational awareness of the power system. In this paper, we study the problem of events detection in power grid frequency disturbance analysis using synchrophasors data streams. Current events detection approaches for power grid rely on individual detection algorithm. This study integrates some of the existing detection algorithms using the concept of machine committee to develop improved detection approaches for grid disturbance analysis. Specifically, we propose two algorithms—an Event Detection Machine Committee (EDMC) algorithm and a Change-Point Detection Machine Committee (CPDMC) algorithm. Both algorithms use parallel architecture to fuse detection knowledge of its individual methods to arrive at an overall output. The EDMC algorithm combines five individual event detection methods, while the CPDMC algorithm combines two change-point detection methods. Each method performs the detection task separately. The overall output of each algorithm is then computed using a voting strategy. The proposed algorithms are evaluated using three case studies of actual power grid disturbances. Compared with the individual results of the various detection methods, we found that the EDMC algorithm is a better fit for analyzing synchrophasors data; it improves the detection accuracy; and it is suitable for practical scenarios.","MDPI","","Oak Ridge National Lab.

The problem is formulated as a Markov game model, where GENCO bidders interact with each other todevelop their optimal day-ahead bidding strategies. Considering unobservable information in the problem, a model-free and data-driven approach, known as multi-agent deep deterministic policy gradient (MADDPG), is applied for approximating the Nash equilibrium (NE) in the above Markov game. The MADDPG algorithm has the advantage of generalization due to the automatic feature extraction ability of the deep neural networks. The algorithm is tested on an IEEE 30-bus system with three competitive GENCO bidders in both an uncongested caseand a congested case. Comparisons with a truthful bidding strategy and state-of-the-art deep reinforcement learning methods including deep Q network and deep deterministic policy gradient (DDPG) demonstrate that the applied MADDPG algorithm can find a superior bidding strategy for all the market participants with increased profit gains. In addition, the comparison with a conventional model-based method shows that the MADDPG algorithm has higher computational efficiency, which is feasible for real-world applications.","Springer","","Oak Ridge National Lab.

"A Novel Active Optimization Approach for Rapid and Efficient Design Space Exploration Using Ensemble Machine Learning","Owoyele, Opeoluwa; Pal, Pinaki","24 POWER TRANSMISSION AND DISTRIBUTION; active learning; engine design optimization; ensemble machine learning; surrogate-based optimization","In this work, a novel design optimization technique based on active learning, which involves dynamic exploration and exploitation of the design space of interest using an ensemble of machine learning algorithms, is presented. In this approach, a hybrid methodology incorporating an explorative weak learner (regularized basis function model) that fits high-level information about the response surface and an exploitative strong learner (based on committee machine) that fits finer details around promising regions identified by the weak learner is employed. For each design iteration, an aristocratic approach is used to select a set of nominees, where points that meet a threshold merit value as predicted by the weak learner are selected for evaluation. In addition to these points, the global optimum as predicted by the strong learner is also evaluated to enable rapid convergence to the actual global optimum once the most promising region has been identified by the optimizer. Additionally, this methodology is first tested by applying it to the optimization of a two-dimensional multi-modal surface and, subsequently, to a complex internal combustion (IC) engine combustion optimization case with nine control parameters related to fuel injection, initial thermodynamic conditions, and in-cylinder flow. It is found that the new approach significantly lowers the number of function evaluations that are needed to reach the optimum design configuration (by up to 80%) when compared to conventional optimization techniques, such as particle swarm and genetic algorithm-based optimization techniques.","ASME","","Argonne National Lab.

"Voltage positioning using co-optimization of controllable grid assets in radial networks","Nazir, Nawaf; Almassalkhi, Mads","24 POWER TRANSMISSION AND DISTRIBUTION; Voltage positioning; mechanical switching devices; holistic scheduling; network admissible formulation","With increasing penetration of solar PV, some distribution feeders are experiencing highly variable net-load flows and even reverse flows. To optimize distribution systems under such conditions, the scheduling of mechanical devices, such as OLTCs and capacitor banks, needs to take into account forecasted solar PV and actual grid conditions. However, these legacy switching assets are operated on a daily or hourly timescale, due to the wear and tear associated with mechanical switching, which makes them unsuitable for real-time control. Therefore, there is a natural timescale- separation between these slower mechanical assets and the responsive nature of inverter-based resources. In this paper, we present a network admissible convex formulation for holistically scheduling controllable grid assets to position voltage optimally against solar PV. An optimal hourly schedule is presented that utilizes mechanical resources to position the predicted voltages close to nominal values, while minimizing the use of inverter-based resources (i.e., DERs), making them available for control at a faster time-scale (after the uncertainty reveals itself). A convex, inner approximation of the OPF problem is adapted to a mixed-integer linear program that minimizes voltage deviations from nominal (i.e., maximizes voltage margins). Here, the resulting OPF solution respects all the network constraints and is, hence, robust against modeling simplifications. Simulation based analysis on IEEE distribution feeders validates the approach.","IEEE","","Univ. of Vermont, Burlington, VT (United States)","USDOE Office of Energy Efficiency and Renewable Energy (EERE)","","United States","2020-12-11T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: IEEE Transactions on Power Systems; Journal Volume: 36; Journal Issue: 4","","Medium: ED; Size: p. 2761-2770","","","EE0008006","Journal ID: ISSN 0885-8950","10.1109/tpwrs.2020.3044206","","2022-11-11T00:00:00Z","1770719","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/1770719","https://www.osti.gov/servlets/purl/1770719","IEEE Transactions on Power Systems","4","36"

Distributed energy resources (DERs), including smart, connected appliances and PV inverters, represent responsive grid resources that can provide flexibility to support the DSO in actively managing their networks to facilitate reliability under extreme levels of solar PV. This flexibility can also be used to optimize system operations with respect to economic signals from wholesale energy and ancillary service markets. Here, we present a novel hierarchical scheme that actively controls behind-the-meter DERs to reliably manage each unbalanced distribution feeder and exploits the available flexibility to ensure reliable operation and economically optimizes the entire distribution network. Each layer of the scheme employs advanced optimization methods at different timescales to ensure that the system operates within both grid and device limits. The hierarchy is validated in a large-scale realistic simulation based on data from the industry. Simulation results show that coordination of flexibility improves both system reliability and economics, and enables greater penetration of solar PV.

Most existing impact assessment studies are scenario-based where derived results are scenario specific and not generalizable. Moreover, stochasticity in temporal behavior of multiple spatially distributed PVs requires a large number of scenarios to be simulated that increases with the size of the network and the level of penetration. Therefore, we propose a new computationally efficient analytical framework of voltage sensitivity analysis that allows for stochastic analysis of voltage change due to random changes in PV generation. We derive an analytical approximation for voltage change at any node of the network due to a change in power at other nodes in an unbalanced distribution network. Then, we derive the probability distribution of voltage change at a certain node due to random changes in power injections/consumptions at multiple locations of the network. The accuracy of the proposed method is illustrated using a modified version of IEEE 37 bus and IEEE 123 bus test systems.

"Combining model-based and model-free methods for stochastic control of distributed energy resources","Chen, Yue; Lin, Yashen","24 POWER TRANSMISSION AND DISTRIBUTION; distributed energy resources; stochastic control; spatial-temporal noise; combining model-based and model-free methods","Modern distribution systems are experiencing a fast transformation with the growing penetration of distributed energy resources (DERs). Along with the economic and environmental benefits of DERs, challenges arise to address the uncertainties caused by their inherent volatility. If properly coordinated, however, DERs have the potential to provide the controllability that grid operators need. Here, we propose a hierarchical control framework that combines the model-based and model-free methods for stochastic DER control in distribution systems. The upper-level scheduler considers a chance-constrained optimal power flow problem (model-based) that schedules DER setpoints to minimize the operational cost and maintain the operating reserve. The lower-level distributed DER controllers absorb real-time disturbances and uncertainties using the extremum seeking control (model-free) to achieve grid objectives. The combination of model-based and model-free methods allows us to take the advantages of both methods to effectively manage the uncertainty in distribution systems. The proposed work is demonstrated on the IEEE 13-node feeder.","Elsevier","","National Renewable Energy Lab.

Because records of actual events in the system are limited, ensemble simulation-based events are needed to provide adequate data for building event-detection models through deep learning; e.g., a convolutional neural network (CNN). An ensemble numerical simulation-based training data set have been generated through dynamic simulations performed on the Polish system with various types of faults in different locations. Such data augmentation is proven to be able to provide adequate data for deep learning. The synchronous generators’ frequency signals are used and encoded into images for developing and evaluating CNN models for classification of fault types and locations. With a time-domain stacked image set as the benchmark, two different time-series encoding approaches, i.e., wavelet decomposition-based frequency-domain stacking and polar coordinate system-based Gramian Angular Field (GAF) stacking, are also adopted to evaluate and compare the CNN model performance and applicability.

With the availability of PMUs, measurement-based approach for model validation has gained significant prominence. In this approach, the quality of a model is analyzed by visually comparing measured generator response with the model-based simulated response for large system disturbances. This paper proposes a new set of performance metrics to assess the model validation results to facilitate automation of the model validation process. In the proposed methodology, first, the slow governor response and comparatively faster oscillatory response are separated, and then a separate set of performance metrics is calculated for each of these two components. These proposed metrics quantify the mismatch between the actual and model-based response in a comprehensive manner without missing any information enabling automation of the process. Furthermore, in this paper, we are also proposing that the sensitivity analysis for model calibration be performed with respect to the proposed metrics for the systematic identification of key parameters.

Additionally, semiconductor technology advancements have played a key role in ICT and unlike the past ICT energy footprint analysis, which focused on the final electronic product, an attempt has been made to examine the global energy impacts for the period 2016–2025 based on the market forecasts of three major IoT IC types, i.e., sensors and actuators, connectivity, and processor ICs distributed among four major IoT device components.Total global IoT semiconductor primary energy demand is projected to increase from 2 EJ in 2016 to 35 EJ by 2025, resulting mainly from a substantial projected increase energy needed in the manufacturing of ICs, with growth in the use of sensors and energy-intensive next fab generation manufacturing. Unlike the trend in manufacturing energy, total global operational energy use is projected to decrease significantly with the development of smaller transistor size, low-power devices, and faster wireless data communication technology. Total operational energy is projected to significantly decrease from 118 TWh/year (1,2 EJ/year) to less than 1 TWh/year (0.003 EJ/year) in spite of a significantly higher anticipated growth in its market size during the 2016–2025 forecast period. Its annual share of total primary energy use is projected to reach an insignificant level of 0.01% by the end of 2025, consistent with the past limited electronic product life cycle analyses besides the analysis focus here limited to ICs in IoT devices.","Elsevier","","Oak Ridge National Lab.

The solution addresses the challenges of high costs and limited efficiency that limit the application of EHA for the electrification of many off-road vehicles. Based on a variable-speed electric motor and a low-cost technology for a fixed-displacement pump, the proposed solution is suitable for a compact implementation and it is capable of energy regeneration under overrunning load conditions. Two different architectures—an open circuit and a closed circuit one—are considered to determine the most practical and efficient configuration as well as the control features. Both architectures minimize throttling losses associated with the conventional regulation of hydraulic actuators. Actuator velocities below the minimum and beyond the maximum allowable pump flow rate are achieved in both architectures using a proportional valve that bypasses the pump flow. The paper describes the design methodology as well as the simulation and experimental activities performed to verify the control strategies as well as energy efficiency. Considering an EHA system of about 20 kW, a complete efficiency map of the system is determined for all the possible four quadrants of operation thus including both resistive and overrunning loads, where energy recuperation is implemented. Simulation and experimental results show that the energy efficiency of the hydraulic systems can reach 84.7% in resistive phases. In assistive phases, the hydraulic system can recover up to 81.8% of the actuator energy. Here, the comparison between open-circuit and closed-circuit structures shows the advantages of the former in terms of energy efficiency. The proposed solution is suitable for electrified hydraulic actuation systems, in both industrial and mobile applications. With the advantages of the low cost of the hydraulic unit and high energy efficiency, it is particularly suitable for mobile applications such as construction machines, that are recently experiencing a significant electrification trend.","Elsevier","","Purdue Univ., West Lafayette, IN (United States)","USDOE","","United States","2020-11-13T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: Energy (Oxford); Journal Volume: 216","","Medium: ED; Size: Article No. 119291","","","EE0008334","Journal ID: ISSN 0360-5442","10.1016/j.energy.2020.119291","","2021-11-15T00:00:00Z","1710210","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/1710210","https://www.osti.gov/servlets/purl/1710210","Energy (Oxford)","","216"

"Enhanced Tensor Completion Based Approaches for State Estimation in Distribution Systems","Madbhavi, Rahul; Natarajan, Balasubramaniam; Srinivasan, Babji","24 POWER TRANSMISSION AND DISTRIBUTION; block tensor completion; voltage estimation; distribution systems; state estimation","Grid state estimation is essential for effective control and management of distribution systems. While weighted least squares has been the conventional method for state estimation, sparsity-aware methods have become popular due to their superior performance with limited data. Matrix completion and compressed sensing-based state estimation approaches exploit the underlying smoothness in the state variables. However, classic matrix completion methods do not take into account the temporal correlation of system states. Compressed sensing methods, on the other hand, require an appropriate choice of sparsifying basis that may not be easy to identify. This paper proposes a blocktensor completion based framework which uses an alternative approach to estimate voltage phasor, power injections and branch currents. This approach utilizes the temporal correlation of the system states in a tensor trace-norm minimization formulation with power flow equations as constraints. Herein, feature scaling is introduced in the problem formulation to benefit from the improved sensitivity of the tensor trace norm to the matrix columns in the scaled unfoldings of the tensor. Weighted tensor norm is utilized to exploit the structures of the different unfoldings of the state measurement tensor to improve the voltage estimation. The estimation accuracy is further improved by alternatively estimating the tensor columns and increasing the available data at each stage in the tensor completion process. The proposed methods are evaluated on the IEEE-33, 37 test systems and a 100- node test system. The proposed methods are shown to provide significant performance gains relative to the classic matrix and tensor completion based approaches.","IEEE","","Kansas State Univ., Manhattan, KS (United States)","USDOE Office of Energy Efficiency and Renewable Energy (EERE), Renewable Power Office.

To ensure that the frequency is above the threshold of the under frequency load shedding, one effective way is to share the spinning reserves among asynchronous AC grids through HVDC systems. In this paper, a coordinated frequency regulation scheme that enables spinning reserves sharing is proposed for such hybrid AC/DC grids. This scheme is a communication-free method that consists of the droop control, the inertia emulation control and the frequency safety control. The combined response of the three controls can increase not only the frequency nadir but also the settled frequency of the disturbed grid. In addition, the hysteresis comparators and the power injection limits are adopted in the frequency regulation scheme to reduce the coupling effect among AC grids. Thus, under small and harmless disturbance, the frequency regulation scheme will be inactive; the disturbance in strong AC grids would not affect the weak AC systems. The frequency regulation scheme coordinates well with the automatic generation control of the grids. Furthermore, the feasibility and effectiveness of the proposed frequency regulation scheme are verified through simulation studies.","Elsevier","","Oak Ridge National Lab.

G.","24 POWER TRANSMISSION AND DISTRIBUTION; nanocarbon aluminum composite; graphene nanoribbons; electrocharging assisted process","Incorporating nano-carbon phases into metal-matrix composites is a promising strategy for simultaneously enhancing electrical conductivity and mechanical properties of metals. Here, we describe the manufacture of novel nano-carbonaluminum composites by an electro-charge-assisted process (EAP) that show 5.6% ± 1.7% increase in electrical conductivity compared to the base metal alloy. The source of nano-carbon that we used in this study is activated carbon with particle size less than 100 nm. The enhancement is attributed to nano-graphitic structures that extend through the lattice of the metal. Through electron transfer from the metal to the nanostructures the electron density at the interface of nano-crystalline graphite and the metal lattice increases thereby enhancing the bulk electrical conductivity. We identify the important fabrication parameters of the EAP for a reaction system employing a tapered graphite cathode. Here, a high current density of 100 A/cm<sup>2</sup> causes ionization and crystallization of the carbon in the liquid metal. The increase in electrical conductivity of the composite are directly related to the incorporation of the nanocrystalline carbon in the metal lattice. The superior performance of these nano-carbon aluminum composites makes them promising candidates for power transmission lines and other applications.","Elsevier","","Univ. of Maryland, College Park, MD (United States)","USDOE","","United States","2020-10-23T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: Carbon; Journal Volume: 173; Related Information: https://doi.org/10.1016/j.carbon.2020.10.063","","Medium: ED; Size: p. 115-125","","","EE0008313","Journal ID: ISSN 0008-6223","10.1016/j.carbon.2020.10.063","","2022-06-09T00:00:00Z","1870685","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/1870685","https://www.osti.gov/servlets/purl/1870685","Carbon","","173"

This paper proposes a framework for the market-based coordination of electricity and natural gas system operations. The proposed framework includes a power system model that accounts for flexibility in the commitment of power plants with short start-up and shut-down times, coupled with a dynamic gas model that simulates when gas cannot be delivered to generators. The capabilities of the framework are illustrated using real-world electric power and gas systems, including scenarios around wind and solar penetrations and the analysis of time-variant, “shaped flow” gas nominations. Our results indicate that coordination between power and gas systems improves total gas delivery and reduces out-of-merit order dispatch in the electricity system, and that shaped flows may reduce unserved gas in systems with high penetrations of wind and solar. Coordination can have mixed effects on carbon-dioxide emissions, with emissions increasing with coordination for current systems during high load weeks but decreasing for systems with high renewable penetrations, particularly during periods of high variability.","Elsevier","","National Renewable Energy Lab.

By violating the cyber systems, the hacker can disrupt the security and stability due to the strong coupling between the cyber and physical facilities. In this paper, one type of cyber attacks designated as the load altering attack is studied for the power system frequency control, and corresponding defense strategies are proposed to improve the frequency control performance. Considering the difficulty of the application of model-based controller into large-scale power systems, a novel model-free defense framework is for the first time presented. Under this framework, both active defense and passive defense strategies are designed. The former assumes that the defender has the initiative to learn different attack scenarios. Adaptive defense strategies are implemented using the online attack identification information and off-line trained strategy pool. The latter assumes that the defender passively tolerates various attack scenarios via the pre-trained off-line strategy. Both approaches prove to be effective through validation based on the IEEE benchmark systems. The proposed defense framework and defense strategies can be extended to other energy control systems to enhance their attack tolerance capability.","Elsevier","","National Renewable Energy Lab.

"Adaptive Threshold-Based Zonal Isolation of Faults in a Multiterminal DC Using Local Measurements","Mitra, Bhaskar; Debnath, Suman; Chowdhury, Badrul","24 POWER TRANSMISSION AND DISTRIBUTION; DC fault; hybrid dc breaker; local measurement; modular multilevel converter (MMC); radial high-voltage direct current (HVdc)","Fast and accurate methods of fault detection and isolation are a pre-emptive measure in multiterminal dc (MTdc) systems. Zonal isolation of faults is necessary to prevent any misopertation of the dc breakers that can lead to a shutdown of the network. Existing techniques require fast-communication or data synchronization methods have their own disadvantages. This article proposes a method for efficient fault zone isolation without the need of a communication link that prevents any misoperation of the dc breakers in a radial MTdc. This method provides individual local measurement-based control to the hybrid dc circuit breakers (dcCB). Faults created outside the zone of protection for a breaker create a change in the rate of change of current or voltage leading to misoperation. To avoid detection using a fixed threshold, an adaptive threshold based approach is suggested that updates the threshold based on the present operating status. Sensitivity analysis by varying the current limiting inductance and fault location is performed. In conclusion, a three terminal radial model of an MTdc is used for zonal isolation using power system computer aided design/electromagnetic transients including dc.","IEEE","","Oak Ridge National Lab.

The traditional SSTs are typically three-stage, i.e., hard-switching cascaded multilevel rectifiers and inverters with dual active bridge (DAB) converters, which leads to bulky passives, low efficiency, and high electromagnetic interference (EMI). This article proposes a new soft-switching solid-state transformer (S4T). The S4T has full-range zero-voltage switching (ZVS), electrolytic capacitor-less dc link, and controlled dv/dt, which reduces EMI. The S4T comprises two reverse-blocking current-source inverter (CSI) bridges, auxiliary branches for ZVS, and transformer magnetizing inductor as a reduced dc link with 60% ripple. Compared with the prior S4T, an effective change on the leakage inductance diode is made to reduce the number of the devices on the main power path by 20% for significant conduction loss saving and retain the same functionality of damping the resonance between the leakage and resonant capacitors and recycling trapped leakage energy. The conduction loss saving is crucial, being the dominating loss mechanism in SSTs. Importantly, the proposed single-stage SST not only holds the potential for high power density and high efficiency but also has full functionality, e.g., multiport dc loads integration, voltage regulation, and reactive power compensation, unlike the traditional single-stage matrix SST. The S4T can achieve single-stage isolated bidirectional dc–dc, ac–dc, dc–ac, or ac–ac conversion. It can also be configured input-series output-parallel (ISOP) in a modular way for medium-voltage (MV) grids. Hence, the S4T is a promising candidate for the SST. The full functionality, e.g., voltage buck–boost, multiport, etc., and the universality of the S4T for the dc–dc, dc–ac, and ac–ac conversion are verified through the simulations and experiments of two-port and three-port MV prototypes based on 3.3 kV SiC MOSFETs in dc–dc, dc–ac, and ac–ac modes at 2 kV.","IEEE","","Georgia Institute of Technology, Atlanta, GA (United States)","USDOE Advanced Research Projects Agency - Energy (ARPA-E)","","United States","2020-10-13T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: IEEE Transactions on Power Electronics; Journal Volume: 36; Journal Issue: 5","","Medium: ED; Size: p. 5236-5249","","","AR0000899","Journal ID: ISSN 0885-8993","10.1109/tpel.2020.3030795","","2022-11-07T00:00:00Z","1892476","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/1892476","https://www.osti.gov/servlets/purl/1892476","IEEE Transactions on Power Electronics","5","36"

Large amounts of water can be consumed in the process of producing electricity. This article focuses on how that water is virtually transferred from power-generating regions to electricity-consuming areas. We propose two metrics, i.e., <em>water substitution ratio</em> and <em>virtual water transfer loss</em>, to assess the efficiency of water use for power generation and virtual transmission of water through the power transmission system, respectively. These metrics are used to estimate the effects of the West–East Electricity Transmission project in China on the water resources used in power-generating regions. Results show that the electricity delivered by the project increased from 228 TWh in 2008 to 683 TWh in 2017. With the construction of wind and solar energy projects, the growth rate of virtual water was slightly slower than that of the electricity transmitted. In 2017, 2.4 km<sup>3</sup> of virtual water was transmitted eastward. The corresponding virtual water transfer loss throughout the transmission system was approximately 100 million m<sup>3</sup>. We estimate that the virtual water footprint of the project will exceed 4.4 km<sup>3</sup> by 2030, which may affect the sustainability of water resources and the ecological environment in western regions of China.","Elsevier","","Lawrence Berkeley National Lab.

First, in hour-time scale, inverter-based TCLs with adjusting temperature set-point are modeled as virtual generators to compensate tie flow deviations in the day-ahead plan. Next, in minute-time scale, virtual batteries representing operating behaviors of inverter-based TCLs with frequency control are scheduled determined by the control of virtual generators in hour-time scale. The virtual batteries are scheduled to smooth out tie flow errors corresponding to day-ahead plan and hour-time scale schedules. The multi-time scale control methods are coordinated to employ the response potential of inverter-based TCLs and response curve-based methods are proposed to control inverter-based TCLs considering the customer privacy. The multi-time scale stochastic schedules which are based on response curves of inverter-based TCLs are coordinated to accommodate wind generation variability.

Distributed energy resources (DERs) based on renewables have experienced rapid growth thanks to the incentive programs and broad-based participation. With the growing prevalence of DERs, the risk of grid instability and vulnerability increases due to the intermittent nature of renewable energy. At the same time, the voltage and frequency deviation problems emerge more often when the reverse power flow occurs under supply-demand imbalance in distributed power systems. Standards and grid codes have been issued for DER inverters to interconnect with the distribution grid. The updated standard and grid codes expect DERs to provide a variety of power system support functions in order to incorporate higher DER penetration and to maximize DER value to the grid. This paper provides an overview of the power system support functions from renewable DER inverters, which are categorized as: voltage regulation by active/reactive power control, frequency regulation by active power control, voltage ride-through, and frequency ride-through. The benefits and drawbacks of each algorithm are presented and compared with its predecessor, manifesting the logic in the evolution of the algorithms.","IEEE","","Oak Ridge National Lab.

These forced oscillations have caused power swings, limited power transfer capability, damaged equipment, and persisted indefinitely until the driving source was located and removed. This paper proposes a comprehensive method to mitigate forced oscillations. Once a forced oscillation is detected, a new source location algorithm can be used to locate the source based on the oscillation mode angle without requiring system topology information. If the source cannot be quickly located and removed, a control strategy can be activated to modulate the active power of utility-scale inverterbased battery energy storage systems (BESSs) to reduce the energy of forced oscillations to a safe level and allow sufficient time for locating the exact source. The proposed source location algorithm is validated using measurements collected during the January 11, 2019 forced oscillation event in North America and other actual grid events, while the proposed control strategy is verified using the Eastern Interconnection dynamic model under the replicated January 11, 2019 forced oscillation event.

A model in a synchronous reference frame that integrates power sharing and voltage–current (V–I) dynamics is also proposed. This model allows for analyzing closed-loop eigenvalue location and robustness margins. The proposed controller was compared against a classical droop approach using proportional-resonant controllers for the inner loops. Mathematical analysis and hardware-in-the-loop (HIL) experiments under variations in the LCL filter components demonstrate fulfillment of robustness and performance bounds of the LQR-ORT controller.

"Quantifying Dynamic On-State Resistance of GaN HEMTs for Power Converter Design via a Survey of Low and High Voltage Devices","Foulkes, Thomas; Modeer, Tomas; Pilawa-Podgurski, Robert N.","24 POWER TRANSMISSION AND DISTRIBUTION; 42 ENGINEERING; 14 SOLAR ENERGY; Dynamic on-state resistance; gallium-nitride (GaN); power transistors; wide bandgap semiconductors","Designing and optimizing high switching frequency, ultra-efficient converters requires detailed knowledge of the behavior and parasitic parameters for both active and passive components. Recently, wide bandgap transistors have enabled simultaneous increases in both switching frequency and efficiency due to higher maximum operating junction temperature limits, lower dc on-state resistances, and reduced parasitic inductances and capacitances. Yet, the early acceptance of gallium-nitride (GaN) switches was plagued by detrimental dynamic on-state resistance effects. This complex phenomenon for GaN devices is characterized by deviations in on-state resistance from dc operating characteristics based on design choices such as the magnitude and duration of both voltage and current stress, switching mode, and junction temperature. While device manufacturers have made improvements compared to early generation devices, experimental evidence from a survey of commercial GaN transistors highlight measurable change in on-state resistance still exists due to variations in voltage stress during hard-switching operation. After sharing insights for obtaining low noise measurements, an analysis method along with two metrics are proposed to characterize dynamic on-state resistance measurements for power electronics designers. Furthermore, quantifying the performance of GaN devices with standardized metrics facilitates a fair comparison between different GaN device technologies during converter development, enables manufacturing qualification for GaN switches, and provides a benchmark to catalyze improvement for the next generation of GaN device development.","IEEE","","Power Integration Technology, LLC, Alameda, CA (United States)","USDOE Office of Energy Efficiency and Renewable Energy (EERE), Renewable Power Office.

Therefore, a new comprehensive composite load model is developed by Western Electricity Coordinating Council (WECC). However, this model is a complex high-order non-linear system with multi-time-scale property, which poses challenges on power system studies with heavy computational burden. In order to reduce the model complexity, the authors firstly develop a large-signal order reduction (LSOR) method using singular perturbation theory. In this method, the fast dynamics are integrated into the slow ones to preserve transient characteristics of the former. Then, accuracy assessment conditions are proposed and embedded into the LSOR to improve and guarantee the accuracy of reduced-order model. Finally, the reduced-order WECC composite load model is derived by using the proposed algorithm. Overall, simulation results show that the reduced-order large-signal model significantly alleviates the computational burden while maintaining similar dynamic responses as the original composite load model.","Institution of Engineering and Technology (IET)","","Iowa State Univ., Ames, IA (United States); Argonne National Lab.

To further this effort this research introduces Monte Carlo (MC)-based power system modeling as a means to inform the Performance Based Earthquake Engineering method and simulates 100,000 sample earthquakes of a 6.8 magnitude (M6.8) Portland Hills Fault (PHF) scenario in the Portland General Electric (PGE) service territory as a proof of concept. This paper also proposes the resilience metric Seismic Load Recovery Factor (SLRF) to quantify the recovery of a downed power system and thus can be used to quantify earthquake economic risk. Using MC results, the SLRF was evaluated to be 19.7 h and the expected economic consequence cost of a M6.8 PHF event was found to be $\$180$ million with an annualized risk of $\$90,000$ given the event’s 1 in 2000 year probability of occurrence. The MC results also identified the eight most consequential substations in the PGE system—i.e., those that contributed to maximum load loss. This paper concludes that retrofitting these substations reduced the expected consequence cost of a M6.8 PHF event to $117 million.","MDPI","","Pacific Northwest National Lab.

Firstly, the optimal and adaptive control problem for VSG is transformed into a reinforcement learning task. Specifically, the control variables, i.e., virtual inertia and damping factor, are defined as the actions. Meanwhile, the active power output, angular frequency and its derivative are considered as the observations. Moreover, the reward mechanism is designed based on three preset characteristic functions to quantify the control targets: (1) maintaining the deviation of angular frequency within special limits; (2) preserving well-damped oscillations for both the angular frequency and active power output; (3) obtaining slow frequency drop in the transient process. Next, to maximize the cumulative rewards, a decentralized deep policy gradient algorithm, which features model-free and faster convergence, is developed and employed to find the optimal control policy. With this effort, a data-driven adaptive VSG controller can be obtained. By using the proposed controller, the inverter-based distributed generator can adaptively adjust its control variables based on current observations to fulfill the expected targets in model-free fashion. Finally, simulation results validate the feasibility and effectiveness of the proposed approach.","Springer","","National Renewable Energy Lab.

"An Iterative Response-Surface-Based Approach for Chance-Constrained AC Optimal Power Flow Considering Dependent Uncertainty","Xu, Yijun; Korkali, Mert; Mili, Lamine; Valinejad, Jaber; Chen, Tao; Chen, Xiao","24 POWER TRANSMISSION AND DISTRIBUTION; AC optimal power flow; response surface; uncertainty; chance constraints; dependence","A modern power system is characterized by a stochastic variation of the loads and an increasing penetration of renewable energy generation, which results in large uncertainties in its states. These uncertainties bring formidable challenges to the power system planning and operation process. To address these challenges, we propose a cost-effective, iterative response-surface-based approach for the chance-constrained AC optimal power-flow problem that aims to ensure the secure operation of the power systems considering dependent uncertainties. Starting from a stochastic-sampling-based framework, we first utilize the copula theory to simulate the dependence among multivariate uncertain inputs. Then, to reduce the prohibitive computational time required in the traditional Monte-Carlo method, we propose, instead of using the original complicated power-system model, to rely on a polynomial-chaos-based response surface. This response surface allows us to efficiently evaluate the time-consuming power-system model at arbitrary distributed sampled values with a negligible computational cost. This further enables us to efficiently conduct an online stochastic testing for the system states that not only screens out the statistical active constraints, but also assists in a better design of the tightened bounds without using any Gaussian or symmetric assumption. Finally, an iterative procedure is executed to fine-tune the optimal solution that better satisfies a predefined probability. The simulations conducted in multiple test systems demonstrate the excellent performance of the proposed method.","IEEE","External Audience (Unlimited)","Lawrence Livermore National Lab.

"Fault-tolerant grid frequency measurement algorithm during transients","Zhan, Lingwei; Xiao, Bailu; Li, Fuhua; Yin, He; Yao, Wenxuan; Li, Zhi; Liu, Yilu","24 POWER TRANSMISSION AND DISTRIBUTION","Many critical electric grid operations rely on accurate grid frequency measurements. Unfortunately, the measurement accuracy can be easily undermined by power system transient faults. During a power system transient fault, the power grid voltages and currents are usually highly distorted by high-frequency components. What is worse, the power grid signals could have discontinuity during some system transient faults such as phase angle jump, and the discontinuity could result in large measurement errors to state-of-the-art grid measurement algorithms. In this study, a fault-tolerant grid frequency measurement algorithm during transients is proposed. The new algorithm consists of two stages. The first stage is a transient detector, and it can detect the occurrence of system transient faults instantaneously. The second stage is the intelligent frequency estimator, and it will adapt its measurements according to the transient detector. The performance of the algorithm is evaluated under different steady-state and transient conditions. Both dependability and security of the fault-tolerant algorithm are assessed by using PSCAD simulation data and IEEE Standard test data.","The Institution of Engineering and Technology","","Oak Ridge National Lab.

A demand response enabled load (DREL) is a flexible grid asset that schedules electricity consumption in response to a time-of-use (TOU) energy price. Consequently, its energy profile differs from that of a conventional load that is insensitive to price. This difference may cause new challenges for distribution system state estimation (DSSE). It is well known that DSSE often needs to use pseudo-measurements based on historic load profiles to increase system observability. However, historic profiles of conventional loads are not representative of DREL behaviors. Additionally, the inaccuracy impacts DSSE results and other DSSE-dependent operations. In this paper, we propose an online pseudo-measurement generation approach for DSSE with DRELs. We formulate an optimization model to represent DRELs self-adjusting actions. Sampling-based stochastic optimization techniques are proposed to account for uncertainties in DRELs. A set of representative DREL behavior data corresponding to the samples are used to characterize DREL pseudo-measurements. Case studies with modified IEEE 123-bus test system verify the validity of the proposed work.","IEEE","","Argonne National Lab.

Fast-frequency support strategies using energy storage systems (ESSs) can be deployed to maintain the inertial response of the system, but information regarding the inertial response of the system is critical for the effective implementation of such control strategies. In this paper, a moving horizon estimation (MHE)-based approach for online estimation of inertia constant of low inertia microgrids is presented. Based on the frequency measurements obtained in response to a non-intrusive excitation signal from an ESS, the inertia constant was estimated using local measurements from the ESS’s phase-locked loop. The proposed MHE formulation was first tested in a linearized power system model, followed by tests in a modified microgrid benchmark from Cordova, Alaska. Even under moderate measurement noise, the technique was able to estimate the inertia constant of the system well within ±20% of the true value. Estimates provided by the proposed method could be utilized for applications such as fast-frequency support, adaptive protection schemes, and planning and procurement of spinning reserves.","Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers","","Sandia National Lab.

It is observed that the measurement errors in both online and offline case studies follow a non-Gaussian distribution, instead of the traditionally assumed Gaussian distribution. It suggests the use of non-Gaussian models, such as Gaussian mixture models, for representing the measurement errors more accurately and realistically.

However, there is no existing test system with such appliance-level data with proper temporospatial diversity in a realistic distribution system. This paper develops a 240-node real distribution test system with appliance-level demand data for responsive loads. The residential appliance-level demand data are derived from smart meters connected to 1,120 homes in a real distribution system from Iowa State, hereafter called Midwest 240-Node test distribution system. A queueing load model was used to derive the appliance-level data from the smart meter data. The Midwest 240-Node test distribution system provides granular appliance-level information for all homes in the distribution system (i.e., individual appliances that constitute the home load), and the aggregate of all customer load emulates the actual smart meter data. The performance of the Midwest 240-Node test distribution system is evaluated by comparing the aggregated appliance-level demand with the actual measured smart meter data from the utility. The one-year appliance data has a mean absolute percentage error of 2.58% compared to the measured smart meter data. The test system is modeled in OpenDSS and GridLAB-D and is openly available to researchers to enable demand response and transactive energy studies with active end-users.","Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers","","Pacific Northwest National Lab.

Power electronics (PE)-based equipment, along with non-linear PE-driven loads, introduce time-varying characteristics and fast switching behavior that increases the complexity of the power system model. Faster control actions are needed to overcome the fast switching dynamics to ensure the reliability and stability of future power systems. Thus, this requires advanced and detailed simulation methods and tools with highly accurate equivalent models to embody the relatively slower electromechanical to faster electromagnetic transient (EMT) phenomena. Conventional transient stability analysis using positive-sequence simulators has become inadequate for representing converter-dominated power systems, while EMT simulators suffer from the high computational burden. This review paper presents accelerated EMT simulation methods and tools that are categorized and discussed in three topics: system equivalents, simulation methods, and accelerating tools. Dynamic system equivalent techniques are discussed to model small to large interconnected external systems of the grid network. Moreover, a systematic review is made for existing EMT simulation methods, along with advanced co-simulation methods, for addressing simulation speed and accuracy issues in large power system networks. Emerging hardware-based simulation tools are reviewed that reduce the computational burden and increase the simulation efficiency of the power system model. Challenges and trends in EMT simulation are also presented and concluded by providing perspectives on this research topic.","Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers","","Univ. of Alaska, Fairbanks, AK (United States)","USDOE Office of Science (SC), Basic Energy Sciences (BES); USDOE Office of Energy Efficiency and Renewable Energy (EERE), Renewable Power Office.

These devices, both utility-owned and consumer-owned, include renewable generation, energy storage, remote switches, voltage regulators, and smart controllable loads. These new devices provide significant potential for increased operational flexibility that can be leveraged to achieve system reconfiguration, resiliency improvements, power quality improvements, and distribution system automation. However, two significant challenges must be addressed before these assets can be leveraged for operations: interoperability and system level validation prior to deployment. Because of the complexity of distributed control systems, and their interactions with legacy centralized controls, a purely simulations-based approach for pre-deployment validation is not sufficient. It requires hardware-in-the-loop (HIL) testing to emulate hardware devices and evaluate their performance. Additionally, securely integrating multiple test facilities at utility operators and vendors can enable the rapid scale-up of evaluation platforms and remove the need for multiple expensive standalone installations. Presented in this paper, is the development of a multi-site evaluation platform that employs Advanced Distribution Management Systems (ADMS), distributed control devices, real-time HIL assets, secure communication links, and protocol adapters. The testbed has been developed at three sites, with one site hosting the ADMS and the other two hosting HIL capabilities. This platform uses standards-based approaches and open-source tools, and hence can serve as a template for other researchers and institutions to implement their multi-site evaluation frameworks for pre-deployment testing.","Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers","","Oak Ridge National Lab.

"Integrated Outage Management With Feeder Restoration for Distribution Systems With DERs","Qi, Chensen; Liu, Chen-Ching","24 POWER TRANSMISSION AND DISTRIBUTION; Outage Management; Feeder Restoration; Distributed Energy Resources; Distribution Systems; Resilience","The increasing deployment of distributed energy resources (DERs) and microgrids benefits power grids by improving system resilience. In a resilience mode without the utility system, the distribution grid relies on DERs to serve critical load. In such a severe event with multiple faults on the distribution feeders, actuation of various protective devices (PDs) divides the distribution system into electrical islands. The undetected actuated PDs due to fault current contributions from DERs can delay the restoration process, thereby reducing the system resilience. In this paper, algorithms are proposed for outage management and feeder restoration for distribution systems with multiple DERs. The Advanced Outage Management (AOM) identifies the faulted sections and actuated PDs in a distribution system with DERs by incorporating smart meter data. The Advanced Feeder Restoration (AFR) is proposed to restore a distribution system with available energy resources taking into consideration the availability of utility sources and DERs as well as the feeder configuration. By partitioning the system into islands, critical load will be served with the available generation resources within islands. When the utility systems become available, the optimal path will be determined to reconnect these islands back to substations and restore the remaining load. The proposed method has been validated with modified IEEE 123-Bus and 8500-Node Test Feeders. Simulation results demonstrate the capability of the integrated AOM and AFR to enhance distribution system resilience.","Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers","","Washington State Univ., Pullman, WA (United States)","USDOE Office of Electricity (OE)","","United States","2021-01-01T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: IEEE Access Journal Volume: 9","","Medium: X; Size: p. 112978-112993","","","OE0000878","Journal ID: ISSN 2169-3536; 9509016","10.1109/ACCESS.2021.3103477","","2021-12-20T00:00:00Z","1836336","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/1836336","","IEEE Access","","9"

Inadvertent or malicious actions could potentially result in gigawatts of load, distributed across large regions, acting nearly simultaneously. We study the resulting impacts of such a perturbation, which were previously recognized, with improved fidelity and granularity using a physically-based power system and demand model. The ResStock tool was used to calculate residential air conditioning load at more than 3,000 locations across the Western Interconnection, corresponding in time to heavy summer and light spring loading. Under an assumption that one cloud platform managed smart thermostats controlling 10%, 15%, or 20% of residential air-conditioning, calculated load steps could be injected into Positive Sequence Load Flow dynamic simulations. These load-driven effects were coupled with two classes of distributed generation ride-through to evaluate the potential for cascading outages. We found frequency deviations in the spring case far exceed the credible contingency event, leading to widespread distributed generation loss, while voltage depressions during the summer loading lead to widespread distributed generation loss and system separation.","Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers","","National Renewable Energy Lab.

Quasi-static time-series (QSTS) simulations are increasingly being utilized to study the implementation of these inverter functions as alternatives to traditional circuit upgrades. However, QSTS analyses can yield significantly different results based on the availability and resolution of input data and other modeling considerations. In this paper, we quantified the uncertainty of QSTS-based curtailment evaluations for two different grid-support functions (autonomous Volt-Var and centralized PV curtailment for preventing reverse power conditions) through extensive sensitivity analyses and hardware testing. We found that Volt-Var curtailment evaluations were most sensitive to poor inverter convergence (-56.4%), PV time-series data (-18.4% to +16.5%), QSTS resolution (-15.7%), and inverter modeling uncertainty (+14.7%), while the centralized control case was most sensitive to load modeling (-26.5% to +21.4%) and PV time-series data (-6.0% to +12.4%). These findings provide valuable insights for improving the reliability and accuracy of QSTS analyses for evaluating curtailment and other PV impact studies.","Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers","","Sandia National Lab.

Today’s growing emphasis on decarbonization of the energy supply is driving renewables adoption and increased interest in electrification. As a result, energy efficiency is being assessed not just in its ability to offset load growth, but also for its ability to alleviate location-specific constraints on transmission and distribution infrastructure. This work demonstrates that advanced measurement and verification modeling techniques can be used to estimate the spatio-temporal grid impact of a portfolio of energy efficiency programs. It extends measurement-based methods to an entire Demand Side Management portfolio and uses a single model to predict annual as well as seasonal building energy use with near-zero bias. In addition, new metrics are introduced to assess grid level impacts of energy efficiency. The results show that the efficiency program portfolio delivers savings of over 12% at the territory-wide proxy level, with substation and feeder level savings ranging from 0.4% to 26%, and ~5%-42% respectively. Overall, these savings impacted 1.0%–1.4% of the energy used at these locations in the grid. This work provides a methodology with potential to connect efficiency with distribution planning, carrying implications for non-wires alternatives and targeted delivery of efficiency programs.","Elsevier","","Lawrence Berkeley National Lab.

In addition to the well-known harmonic injection method to obtain the admittance at frequency points followed by vector fitting, we adopt a step response-based method where the step response data of the converter are collected and their s-domain expressions are obtained. In turn, the s-domain admittance model of the converter is found. The two methods can be used for cross validation. Step responses and frequency-domain responses obtained from the two methods are compared. Results show that the time- domain data-based method leads to an admittance comparable with that from the frequency-domain measurement in the range less than 60 Hz. In addition, two insights are obtained from the frequency-domain admittance measurements. First, when the dq- frame is aligned to the point of common coupling (PCC) voltage, the per unit DQ-domain admittance directly reflects operating conditions.

"Robust Distribution System Load Restoration With Time-Dependent Cold Load Pickup","Song, Meng; nejad, Reza Roofegari; Sun, Wei","24 POWER TRANSMISSION AND DISTRIBUTION; cold load pickup; distribution system restoration; robust optimization; thermostatically controlled load","Service restoration is one of the critical functions to enable the future self-healing distribution system. To restore the distribution system in a timely and reliable manner, the realistic system operating conditions need to be accurately characterized. Here, two main factors that have great impacts on distribution system restoration (DSR) in practice are investigated. First, cold load pickup (CLPU), generally caused by thermostatically controlled loads (TCLs), is a common phenomenon after an outage and shaped by the outage duration. However, the time-dependent behaviors of CLPU are rarely considered in literature. In this paper, the operating state evolution of TCLs after an outage is analyzed to characterize time-dependent CLPU. And the time-dependent CLPU is analytically embedded in DSR to accurately represent the actual behaviors of the restored loads. Second, it is difficult to predict loads that fluctuate during DSR due to the lack of real-time measurement data. Accordingly, a robust DSR based on the information gap decision theory (IGDT) is proposed to address this challenge, fully considering the uncertainty of CLPU. The proposed models are tested in IEEE 13-node and 123-node test feeders. Simulation results demonstrate that the time-dependent CLPU model and the uncertainty modeling of CLPU can accurately capture the actual behaviors of loads with TCLs after an outage, which greatly improves DSR decisions in practice.","IEEE","","Univ. of Central Florida, Orlando, FL (United States)","USDOE Office of Energy Efficiency and Renewable Energy (EERE), Renewable Power Office.

The proposed solution coordinates resources in response to the worst-case scenario for each possible typhoon path. The optimal decision is based on the characterization of the power system schedule into three stages of preventive control, emergency control, and restoration. Preventive control is performed before the typhoon occurs by quickly adjusting the three-stage resilient unit commitment schedule; emergency control is conducted during the typhoon by shedding local loads to meet the power balance, while other control strategies are assumed to be unavailable due to possible interruptions in the communication system; restoration is realized after the typhoon, when resources are optimally dispatched to repair the outages of critical devices and recover the normal operation state of the power system quickly. Considering the typhoon path uncertainty, we have introduced a stochastic model for possible typhoon paths where all possible affected lines along each typhoon path are assumed to be on outage during the typhoon. Accordingly, we explore the strategy for co-optimizing the three stages in unit commitment. The proposed model is tested on the IEEE 118-bus system and the real-world provincial system to verify its effectiveness.","IEEE","","Argonne National Lab.

"Collaborative Distribution System Restoration Planning and Real-Time Dispatch Considering Behind-the-Meter DERs","Liu, Weijia; Ding, Fei","24 POWER TRANSMISSION AND DISTRIBUTION; distribution system restoration; distributed energy resources; model predictive control; real-time dispatch; restoration planning; unbalanced distribution system","Modern distribution systems are becoming more resilient against power outages thanks to the flexible generation capacity provided by the increasing integration of distributed energy resources (DERs). Compared to utility-scale DERs, which can be directly controlled by system operators, small-scale, behind-the-meter DERs are much more difficult to coordinate despite being the vast majority. Two major obstacles to the implementation of DERs for service restoration are the coordination of behind-the-meter DERs and the management of uncertainty. In this paper, a novel distribution system restoration strategy is proposed to overcome these two obstacles. The flexibility of be-hind-the-meter DERs is quantified and integrated into the restoration planning models within a hierarchical structure. The model predictive control technique is employed to enable adaptive restoration planning solution adjustments to accommodate fault scenarios and forecast errors. Besides, real-time power dispatch models are proposed to maintain power balance using available DER capability. Comprehensive integration of adaptive restoration planning schemes and real-time dispatch results are achieved through a collaborative restoration framework. Finally, the effectiveness of the proposed restoration strategy is verified through a modified IEEE 123-bus system and a real-world utility system.","IEEE","","National Renewable Energy Lab.

However, it has been commonly seen that DR events using TCLs may cause load synchronization and unwanted oscillatory effects, especially in homogeneous populations. In an attempt to mitigate the negative impacts of DR events, a decentralized method is proposed that modifies each thermostat behavior based on the activity of a small number of nearby TCLs. This feedback introduces the possibility of instability in the aggregate behavior. A stability analysis is performed on a linearized model of the aggregate system and the results of that analysis compared to simulation results. The proposed modification of thermostat behavior results in fourfold reduction in the post-DR peak while suppressing ensuing oscillations at the expense of a modest increase in compressor cycling. Further, the linearized model also provides insight into the aggregate behavior of the population.","AMSE","","Boise State Univ., ID (United States)","USDOE Office of Energy Efficiency and Renewable Energy (EERE), Energy Efficiency Office.

The stochastic hosting capacity simulation effort iterated through hundreds of load and PV generation scenarios and various control types. The simulations also tested the impact of VVCs with tampered settings to understand the potential risks associated with a cyber-attack on all of the PV inverters scattered throughout a feeder. The simulation effort found that the VVC can have an insignificant role in managing the voltage when deployed in distributed roof-top PV inverters. This type of integration strategy will result in little to no harm when subjected to a successful cyber-attack that alters the VVC settings.","MDPI AG","","Sandia National Lab.

This paper presents an in-depth analysis of IIDG behavior during grid faults and proposes a more accurate reduced-order parameterized short-circuit current (RPSC) model of inverters. Typical inverter components are thoroughly investigated to identify those that play dominant roles during faults. The paper shows that the current limiter is the dominant factor for the steady-state fault-current of inverter; while the inverter filter along with the severity of the voltage disturbance largely determine the initial transient spike of inverter fault current. The proposed model is low-order and can be used in large scale simulations. The parameters of the proposed RPSC model can be extracted from laboratory experiments without requiring proprietary manufacturer information. The proposed fault-current model is analogous to the well-known synchronous machine model that segregates the inverter fault current into subtransient, transient, and steady-state fault currents. Finally, experimental and simulation tests are presented to validate the model.","IEEE","","National Renewable Energy Lab.

Thus, a modern society that depends on reliable electric supply requires a resilient electric system that can recover from disruptions while integrating emerging smart grid technologies. Here, this article presents a novel approach for service restoration in a modern power distribution system with controllable switches and distributed generation (DG) resources for any kind of outage. The proposed framework supports both the traditional service restoration using feeder reconfiguration and the grid-forming DG-assisted intentional islands that are dynamically sized using algorithms based on the fault scenario, available resources, and priority of loads. The problem is formulated as a mixed-integer linear program that incorporates critical system connectivity and operating constraints. Simulations are performed to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed approach using a large-scale four-feeder 1069-bus three-phase unbalanced distribution test system. It is demonstrated that the framework is effective in utilizing all available resources in quickly restoring the power supply to improve resiliency during extreme events and is scalable for a large-scale unbalanced power distribution system.","IEEE","","Pacific Northwest National Lab.

The instant large disturbance occurs, the post-disturbance state of the system could deviate significantly from the pre-disturbance one. It is desirable and necessary to develop an efficient method to certify the existence of state and predict the approximate post-disturbance state because: (1) faster warning can be made in online assessment; and (2) the dynamic simulator can be given better initial values to calculate precise solutions, which prevents convergence failure brought on by poor initial values. We propose a novel approach for efficiently certifying and predicting the post-disturbance states in dynamic security assessment. Based on the fixed-point power flow mapping approach applied to salient pole generator models, the criterion for determining the existence and uniqueness of the post-disturbance solution is derived, and the bounds of post-disturbance solution can be rigorously characterized.","Elsevier","","Argonne National Lab.

Using previous observations of ADMM trajectories for a given system under varying load, the method trains a recurrent neural network (RNN) to predict the converged values of dual and consensus variables. Given a new realization of system load, a small number of initial ADMM iterations is taken as input to infer the converged values and directly inject them into the iteration. We empirically demonstrate that the online injection of these values into the ADMM iteration accelerates convergence by a significant factor for partitioned 14-, 118-and 2848-bus test systems under differing load scenarios. The proposed method has several advantages: it maintains the security of private decision variables inherent in consensus ADMM; inference is fast and so may be used in online settings; RNN-generated predictions can dramatically improve time to convergence but, by construction, can never result in infeasible ADMM subproblems; it can be easily integrated into existing software implementations. While we focus on the ADMM formulation of distributed DC-OPF in this paper, the ideas presented are naturally extended to other distributed optimization problems.","IEEE","","National Renewable Energy Lab.

As such, there is a trend to resort to grid-forming inverters which set frequency directly. We propose a novel grid-forming frequency shaping control that is able to shape the aggregate system frequency dynamics into a first-order one with the desired steady-state frequency deviation and Rate of Change of Frequency (RoCoF) after a sudden power imbalance. The no overshoot property resulting from the first-order dynamics allows the system frequency to monotonically move towards its new steady-state without experiencing frequency Nadir, which largely improves frequency security. We prove that our grid-forming frequency-shaping control renders the system internally stable under mild assumptions.

To achieve this, first, a breadth-first search (BFS)-based mechanism is proposed to decompose the network into a set of zones that maximize outage location information in partially observable systems. Then, using SM data in each zone, a generative adversarial network (GAN) is designed to implicitly extract the temporal-spatial behavior in normal conditions in an unsupervised fashion. After training, an anomaly scoring technique is leveraged to determine if real-time measurements indicate an outage event in the zone. Finally, to infer the location of the outage events in a multi-zone network, a zone coordination process is proposed to take into account the interdependencies of intersecting zones. We have provided analytical guarantees of performance for our algorithm using the concept of entropy, which is leveraged to quantify outage location information in multi-zone grids. Furthermore, the proposed method has been tested and verified on distribution feeder models with real SM data.","IEEE","","Iowa State Univ., Ames, IA (United States)","USDOE Office of Electricity (OE); National Science Foundation (NSF)","","United States","2020-07-30T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: IEEE Transactions on Smart Grid; Journal Volume: 11; Journal Issue: 6","","Medium: ED; Size: p. 5418-5430","","","OE0000875; ECCS 1929975","Journal ID: ISSN 1949-3053","10.1109/tsg.2020.3008770","","2023-03-17T00:00:00Z","1961198","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/1961198","https://www.osti.gov/servlets/purl/1961198","IEEE Transactions on Smart Grid","6","11"

To improve computation efficiency, model reduction techniques have been investigated to only preserve the dynamics in a limited area of interest (study area), while deriving equivalent representation for the external area. For this purpose, a measurement-based reduction approach using system identification techniques has been previously proposed. Accordingly, external areas are represented by dynamic equivalent loads using transfer function estimation. In this paper, in order to enhance the accuracy of the reduced model in preserving dynamics of the study area, multiple “grid” events of different types and at different locations are considered for identifying the parameters of the equivalent loads. Additionally, case studies are carried out in the NPCC 140-bus system. Comparisons are made between multiple events training and single event training, highlighting the advantages of the proposed method in providing a better representation of the grid dynamics under different operating conditions.","Elsevier","","Oak Ridge National Lab.

The proposed control technique is based on model-free control (MFC), which has shown successful operation and improved performance in different domains and applications. This paper presents its first use in the voltage stability of a microgrid setting employing multiple synchronous generator (SG)-based and power electronic (PE)-based DERs. MFC is a computationally efficient, data-driven control technique that does not require modelling of the different components and disturbances in the power system. It is utilized as an online controller to achieve the dynamic voltage stability of a microgrid system under different disturbances and fault conditions. A 21-bus microgrid system fed by multiple DERs is considered as a case study and the overall dynamic voltage stability is investigated using time-domain dynamic simulations. Numerical results show that the proposed MFC provides improvements on the dynamic load bus voltage profiles and requires less computational time as compared to the traditional enhanced microgrid voltage stabilizer (EMGVS) scheme. Due to its simplicity and low computational requirement, MFC can be easily implemented in resource-constrained computing devices such as smart inverters.","MDPI AG","","Oak Ridge National Lab.

For the building owner, reduced expenses come from the reduction or elimination of peak power charges on electricity bills. For the power system operator, reducing peak power demand leads to a more predictable load profile and reduces stress on the electric grid system. Herein we present a computationally inexpensive, dynamic, and retrofit-deployable control strategy to effect peak load reduction and load shaping. The effectiveness of the control strategy is examined in a simulation with 80 air-conditioning units and 40 refrigeration units. The results show that a peak demand reduction of 60 kW can be achieved relative to peak demand in a typical set point–based approach. The proposed strategy was deployed in a gymnasium building with four rooftop HVAC units, where it showed over 15% peak demand (kW) reduction savings while maintaining or lowering energy consumption (in kilowatt-hours) relative to the set point–based thermostat controls.","Elsevier","","Oak Ridge National Lab.

"Risk Assessment of Rare Events in Probabilistic Power Flow via Hybrid Multi-Surrogate Method","Xu, Yijun; Korkali, Mert; Mili, Lamine; Chen, Xiao; Min, Liang","24 POWER TRANSMISSION AND DISTRIBUTION; risk assessment; rare events; branch outage; Monte-Carlo sampling; probabilistic power flow; polynomial chaos expansion","The risks associated with rare events threatening the security of power system operation are of paramount importance to power system planners and operators. To analyze the risks caused by high-impact, low-frequency rare events, an immensely large number of samples are typically required for the Monte-Carlo (MC) method on the high-fidelity power system model to achieve a sufficient accuracy, thereby rendering this approach computationally prohibitive. To handle this problem efficiently, it is desirable to construct a surrogate model for the power system response. However, the straightforward MC sampling of the low-fidelity surrogate can lead to biased results in the low-probability tail regions that are vital to risk assessment. Moreover, a single surrogate is unable to handle the topology uncertainties caused by random branch outages. To overcome these issues, we propose a hybrid multi-surrogate (HMS) method based on the polynomial chaos expansion (PCE) with low-probability tail events reevaluated by the high-fidelity model through a probabilistic analysis. This method improves the computational efficiency of the MC method for rare-event risk assessment by leveraging multi-fidelity models while retaining the desired accuracy. Simulations conducted in three test systems verify the excellent performances of the HMS method.","IEEE","External Audience (Unlimited)","Lawrence Livermore National Lab.

"WECC Composite Load Model Parameter Identification Using Evolutionary Deep Reinforcement Learning","Bu, Fankun; Ma, Zixiao; Yuan, Yuxuan; Wang, Zhaoyu","24 POWER TRANSMISSION AND DISTRIBUTION; WECC composite load model; parameter identification; evolutionary strategy; intelligent exploration","Due to the increasing penetration of distributed energy resources (DERs), the load composition in distribution grids has significantly changed. This inverter-based device has notably different behavior from traditional static and induction motor loads. To accurately represent the combination of static load, induction motor and the emerging inverter-based devices, the composite load model with distributed generation (CMPLDWG) has been developed by Western Electricity Coordinating Council (WECC). Due to the large number of parameters and model complexity, the CMPLDWG model brings new challenges to parameter identification, which is critical to power system studies. To address these challenges, in this paper, a cutting-edge approach inspired by the evolutionary deep reinforcement learning (EDRL) with an intelligent exploration mechanism is innovatively proposed to perform parameter identification for CMPLDWG. First, to extract parameters' contributions to dynamic power, parameter sensitivity analysis is conducted using a data-driven feature-wise kernelized Lasso (FWKL). Then, the EDRL with intelligent exploration, which can handle the natural high nonlinearity and nonconvexity of CMPLDWG, is employed to perform parameter identification. In the parameter identification process, the extracted parameter sensitivity weights are innovatively integrated into the EDRL with intelligent exploration to improve discovery efficiency. Lastly, the proposed approach is validated using numerical experiments.","IEEE","","Iowa State Univ., Ames, IA (United States)","USDOE Office of Electricity (OE)","","United States","2020-07-13T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: IEEE Transactions on Smart Grid; Journal Volume: 11; Journal Issue: 6","","Medium: ED; Size: p. 5407-5417","","","OE0000875","Journal ID: ISSN 1949-3053","10.1109/tsg.2020.3008730","","2023-03-17T00:00:00Z","1961202","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/1961202","https://www.osti.gov/servlets/purl/1961202","IEEE Transactions on Smart Grid","6","11"

In this study we model electric vehicle charging at a workplace using real charging data and evaluate the lifetime of the site’s transformer as the number of charging stations is incrementally increased. We implement and compare a range of control schemes for workplace charging including minimizing the peak load, capping the total load, minimizing bills under different rate structures with time-of-use energy costs and demand charges, and directly minimizing the transformer’s aging. These are compared by the number of vehicles they allow the transformer to support, the transformer’s health, and the operator’s electricity bill. We draw a connection between minimizing the peak load and improving the transformer’s health. We observe that minimizing the electricity bill is the best scheme by both criteria when the bill includes a demand charge; in our experiment it allowed the infrastructure to support over 67% more cars than under uncontrolled charging. To protect the transformer we recommend that demand charges or capacity management be applied to parking lots of charging electric vehicles with high infrastructure utilization, and operators schedule charging to minimize their electricity bills.","Elsevier","","SLAC National Accelerator Lab., Menlo Park, CA (United States)","USDOE Office of Energy Efficiency and Renewable Energy (EERE), Renewable Power Office.

The isochronous framework obviates the need for an explicit regulation of the frequency while allowing for sharing of reactive power. The article shows that the detrimental effects of circulating currents between inverters can be addressed in the framework developed. The isochronous architecture is implemented by employing a GPS to disseminate clock timing signals that enable the microgrid to maintain the nominal system frequency. Small signal eigenvalue analysis of a Multi-inverter Microgrid system near the steady-state operating point is presented to evaluate the system stability. Moreover, unlike traditional droop-based methods, the isochronous strategy lends itself to analytical guarantees which are developed in the article. Furthermore, the effect of delays in receiving GPS clock signals by an inverter is experimentally characterized and an inverter isolation mechanism is proposed that disconnects inverters facing large GPS communication delays. Hardware experiments on an 1.2 kVA-prototype and controller-hardware-in-the-loop validation on the CIGRE distribution network are conducted to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed architecture towards active and reactive power sharing between inverters with load scenarios.","IEEE","","National Renewable Energy Lab.

Many of the operations in the existing power system rely on a stable and secured communication system. For electrically weak systems and time-critical applications, this reliance can be even greater, where a small degradation in communication performance can degrade system stability. However, despite inter-dependencies between power and communication systems, only a few studies have investigated the impacts of communication system performance on power system dynamics. This paper investigates the dependencies of power system dynamics operations on communication system performance. First, a detailed, dynamic networked urban-microgrid model is developed in the GridLAB-D simulation environment, along with a representative multi-traffic, multi-channel, multi-protocol communication system model, developed in the network simulator (ns-3).

The impact of communication system delays on the dynamic stability of networked microgrids’ is evaluated for the loss of generation using three use-cases. While the example use-cases examine microgrid applications and the impact to resiliency, the framework can be applied to all levels of power system operations.","Institution of Engineering and Technology (IET)","","Pacific Northwest National Lab.

The model for the islanded microgrid is developed by integrating all the inverter dynamics using a state-space model for the load currents. This model is presented in a comprehensive way such that it could be scalable to any number of inverter-based generators using inductor–capacitor–inductor (LCL) output filters. The use of these models allows designers to assess microgrid stability and robustness using modern control methods such as eigenvalue analysis and singular value diagrams. Both models were tested and validated in an experimental setup to demonstrate their accuracy in describing microgrid dynamics. In addition, three scenarios are presented: non-controlled model, Linear-Quadratic Integrator (LQI) power control, and Power-Voltage (PQ/Vdq) droop–boost controller. Experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of the control strategies and the accuracy of the models to describe microgrid dynamics.","MDPI AG","","Univ. of Alaska, Fairbanks, AK (United States)","USDOE Office of Science (SC), Basic Energy Sciences (BES); USDOE Office of Energy Efficiency and Renewable Energy (EERE); USDOE Office of Electricity (OE)","","United States","2020-06-25T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: Energies; Journal Volume: 13; Journal Issue: 12","","Medium: ED; Size: Article No. 3279","","","SC0020281","Journal ID: ISSN 1996-1073","10.3390/en13123279","","2022-11-11T00:00:00Z","1771377","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/1771377","https://www.osti.gov/servlets/purl/1771377","Energies","12","13"

"Inexact convex relaxations for AC optimal power flow: Towards AC feasibility","Venzke, Andreas; Chatzivasileiadis, Spyros; Molzahn, Daniel K.","24 POWER TRANSMISSION AND DISTRIBUTION; Convex quadratic optimization; Nonlinear programming; Optimal power flow; Semidefinite programming","Convex relaxations of AC optimal power flow (AC-OPF) problems have attracted significant interest as in several instances they provably yield the global optimum to the original non-convex problem. If, however, the relaxation is inexact, the obtained solution is not AC-feasible. The quality of the obtained solution is essential for several practical applications of AC-OPF, but detailed analyses are lacking in existing literature. Here, this paper aims to cover this gap. We provide an in-depth investigation of the solution characteristics when convex relaxations are inexact, we assess the most promising AC feasibility recovery methods for large-scale systems, and we propose two new metrics that lead to a better understanding of the quality of the identified solutions. We perform a comprehensive assessment on 96 different test cases, ranging from 14 to 3120 buses, and we show the following: (i) Despite an optimality gap of less than 1%, several test cases still exhibit substantial distances to both AC feasibility and local optimality and the newly proposed metrics characterize these deviations. (ii) Penalization methods fail to recover an AC-feasible solution in 15 out of 45 test cases. (iii) The computational benefits of warm-starting non-convex solvers have significant variation, but a computational speedup exists in over 75% of cases.","Elsevier","","Argonne National Lab.

"Distributed Conditions for Small-signal Stability of Power Grids and Local Control Design","Baros, Stefanos; Bernstein, Andrey; Hatziargyriou, Nikos","24 POWER TRANSMISSION AND DISTRIBUTION; distributed; small-signal stability; control design; multi-agent system","Operating modern power grids with stability guarantees is markedly important. Typical methods for analyzing and certifying power grid stability are largely centralized relying on the ability of the system operator to gather network-wide information and accurately compute the system's eigenvalues. These methods are oftentimes not privacy-preserving and computationally burdensome. They are therefore, not well-suited to modern power grids where small-signal stability has to be evaluated timely, efficiently and in a privacy-preserving fashion. Herein, we introduce a distributed methodology for certifying small-signal stability of power grids and designing the local controllers. First, we analytically derive distributed conditions for network-wide stability that bus agents can inspect using local information. By leveraging these conditions, we then introduce a distributed control design algorithm (DCDA) that can guide the local control design so that stability of the interconnected system is guaranteed. The agents that adopt the proposed distributed algorithm are responsible for tuning their local controllers, producing their local control commands and ensuring that their local stability condition is met. The system operator is only responsible for verifying network-wide stability upon receiving affirmative responses from all agents and, announcing, that the overall system is stable. The proposed DCDA algorithm is numerically validated via simulations using the IEEE 39-bus system.","IEEE","","National Renewable Energy Lab.

"Formulation of Three-Phase State Estimation Problem Using a Virtual Reference","Langner, Andre L.; Abur, Ali","24 POWER TRANSMISSION AND DISTRIBUTION; State estimation; distribution systems; three phase modeling; reference bus","State Estimation (SE) is the backbone of modern Energy Management System (EMS) due its capability of processing real time measurements and provide reliable information to system operators. Since its introduction to power systems in the 70’s, SE has been widely used in transmission networks. Distribution grids on the other hand lack sufficient number of real time measurements, and for that reason SE has not been widely implemented on these systems. The recent increase in the number of renewable energy sources connected to the grid at lower voltage levels, the advent of Distribution Automation (DA) and Smart Grids necessitate closer monitoring of distribution networks and thus forcing utilities to upgrade their operations and deploy Advanced Distribution Management Sytems (ADMS). Therefore, Distribution System State Estimation (DSE) is paramount to provide real time monitoring of active distribution grids. This papers investigates the formulation of the three-phase distribution state estimation where in the most general case, none of the system buses may have balanced three phase voltages. In such a case, the choice and definition of the slack bus need to be revisited. Most of the existing work arbitrarily assign the root bus of the distribution feeder as the balanced three-phase reference which may not be realistic for today’s active distribution systems. This paper addresses this shortcoming of the existing SE formulations by introducing a virtual reference bus. Here, the proposed approach is effectively validated by simulations carried out on distribution test systems.","IEEE","","Northeastern Univ., Boston, MA (United States)","USDOE Office of Energy Efficiency and Renewable Energy (EERE), Renewable Power Office.

The nonlinear function between system operating condition and frequency nadir is approximated by using a neural network, which admits an exact mixed-integer formulation (MIP). This formulation is then integrated with the scheduling problem to encode the frequency constraint. With the stronger representation power of the neural network, the resulting commands can ensure adequate frequency response in a realistic setting in addition to islanding success. The proposed method is validated on a modified 33-node system. Successful islanding with a secure response is simulated under the scheduled commands using a detailed three-phase model in Simulink. The advantages of our model are particularly remarkable when the inertia emulation functions from wind turbine generators are considered.","IEEE","","Oak Ridge National Lab.

Performing tests at scale using real equipment is impractical, so simulation offers the only viable route to developmental testing at scales of practical interest. Existing power-grid testbeds are unable to model individual residential end-use devices for developing detailed control formulations for responsive loads and DERs.

This article presents three methods to address these challenges. First, an enhanced zero-crossing algorithm was developed to track the fast-changing frequency in system dynamics. Second, we propose a technology that can tolerate the system transient and suppress the outliers. Third, an algorithm was developed to export high time-resolution frequency estimations with minimum computational effort. All of the proposed methods are realized in hardware and compared with classical frequency estimation methods. The testing results indicate that the proposed methods have excellent performance. They can be used in future PMUs and provide reliable and high time resolution data for smart grid applications.","IEEE","","Oak Ridge National Lab.

"Perturbation-Based Diagnosis of False Data Injection Attack Using Distributed Energy Resources","Jhala, Kumarsinh; Pradhan, Parth; Natarajan, Balasubramaniam","24 POWER TRANSMISSION AND DISTRIBUTION; Cyber-physical security; Distributed energy resources; Distributed generation; False data injection; Moving target defense; Power distribution","Modern smart grid relies on various sensor measurements for its operational control. In a successful false data injection attack, the attacker manipulates the measurements from the grid sensors such that undetected errors are introduced into the estimates of the system parameters leading to catastrophic situations. This paper proposes a novel perturbation based false data injection attack detection mechanism that utilizes inverter based distributed energy resources (DERs) to create low magnitude perturbation signal in the distribution system voltage that is inconsequential to the normal grid operation. Two voltage sensitivity analysis based algorithms are designed to identify the optimal set of DERs that can create the voltage perturbation signal of desired magnitude. An analytical method of voltage sensitivity analysis is used to compute the magnitude of voltage perturbation signal at each node in a computationally efficient manner. Then, a detection mechanism is developed that checks for the presence of the perturbation sequence in each sensor measurement. A sensor measurement is deemed authentic if the voltage perturbation signal is present in the data. In case of sensor malfunction or cyber-attack, the perturbation signal will not be present in the measurement data. Performance of the proposed attack detection mechanism is validated via simulation of the IEEE 69 bus test system.","IEEE","","Argonne National Lab.

"Guest Editorial: Planning and operation of resilient distribution system for integrated multi-energy","Li, Xue; Dimitrovski, Aleksandar; Tomsovic, Kevin; Ding, Fei; Liu, Guodong","24 POWER TRANSMISSION AND DISTRIBUTION; distribution systems; integrated energy; resilience","Resilience is the ability of power systems to prepare for and adapt to low-probability, high-impact incidents and withstand and recover rapidly from disruptions. With the ageing of electricity distribution infrastructure and increasing threats of weather-related incidents and natural disasters, the need to effectively enhance the resilience of the electricity distribution system has become urgent and has attracted worldwide attention. Although there are an increasing number of publications related to enhancing resilience strategies, resilience is an emerging concept in power systems. Existing practices are mostly focused on deploying distributed energy resources (DERs) and microgrids, hardening the existing infrastructures and building redundant capacities. However, from a broader perspective, resilience enhancement of power distribution system is a systematic engineering, involving long-term system planning and upgrading (e.g., deployment of smart grid technologies and intelligent switches), short-term proactive scheduling, real-time robust and resilient control of DERs, and post-event restoration and recovery strategies. Based on this point, this Special Issue in IET Energy System Integration focuses on soliciting the most recent and original technologies, scheduling and control strategies for improving the resilience of power distribution system. Eight papers are presented in this Special Issue, covering various aspects related to resilience enhancement of power distribution system, including fault-tolerant frequency measurement, robust scheduling of integrated electricity and district heating systems, robust control of DERs, efficient methods for safety verification as well as novel graph theory-based approach to restore the distribution systems after multiple simultaneous faults. A brief introduction of these 8 papers is provided below.","The Institution of Engineering and Technology","","Oak Ridge National Lab.

"Synthetic residential load models for smart city energy management simulations","Reis, Fernando B.; Tonkoski, Reinaldo; Hansen, Timothy M.","24 POWER TRANSMISSION AND DISTRIBUTION","The ability to control tens of thousands of residential electricity customers in a coordinated manner has the potential to enact system-wide electric load changes, such as reduce congestion and peak demand, among other benefits. To quantify the potential benefits of demand-side management and other power system simulation studies (e.g. home energy management, large-scale residential demand response), synthetic load datasets that accurately characterize the system load are required. This study designs a combined top-down and bottom-up approach for modelling individual residential customers and their individual electric assets, each possessing their own characteristics, using time-varying queueing models. The aggregation of all customer loads created by the queueing models represents a known city-sized load curve to be used in simulation studies. The three presented residential queueing load models use only publicly available data. An open-source Python tool to allow researchers to generate residential load data for their studies is also provided. The simulation results presented consider the ComEd region (utility company from Chicago, IL) and demonstrate the characteristics of the three proposed residential queueing load models, the impact of the choice of model parameters, and scalability performance of the Python tool.","Institution of Engineering and Technology (IET)","","South Dakota State Univ., Brookings, SD (United States)","USDOE Office of Science (SC), Basic Energy Sciences (BES); National Science Foundation (NSF)","","United States","2020-05-19T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: IET Smart Grid; Journal Volume: 3; Journal Issue: 3","","Medium: ED; Size: p. 342-354","","","SC0020281; CNS-1726946","Journal ID: ISSN 2515-2947; ECCS‐1608722","10.1049/iet-stg.2019.0296","","2022-08-12T00:00:00Z","1870512","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/1870512","https://www.osti.gov/servlets/purl/1870512","IET Smart Grid","3","3"
"Demand response scheduling under uncertainty: Chance–constrained framework and application to an air separation unit","Kelley, Morgan T.; Baldick, Ross; Baldea, Michael","24 POWER TRANSMISSION AND DISTRIBUTION; demand response; uncertainty; chance constraints; air separation unit","Recent increases in renewable power generation challenge the operation of the power grid: generation rates fluctuate in time and are not synchronized with power demand fluctuations. Demand response (DR) consists of adjusting user electricity demand in order to balance available power supply. Chemical plants are appealing candidates for DR programs; they offer large, concentrated loads that can be modulated via production scheduling. Price-based DR is a common means of engaging industrial entities; its benefits increase significantly when a longer (typically, a few days) scheduling time horizon is considered. DR production scheduling comes with its own challenges, related to uncertainty in future (i.e., forecast) electricity prices and product demand. In this work, we provide a framework for DR production scheduling under uncertainty based on a chance-constrained formulation, that also accounts for the dynamics of the production facility. Furthermore, the ideas are illustrated with an air separation unit case study.","American Institute of Chemical Engineers","","Univ. of Texas at Austin, TX (United States)","USDOE; National Science Foundation (NSF)","","United States","2020-05-16T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: AIChE Journal; Journal Volume: 66; Journal Issue: 9","","Medium: ED; Size: Article No. e16273","","","FG02-97ER25308; OE0000841; DE‐FG02‐97ER25308; DE‐OE0000841","Journal ID: ISSN 0001-1541; 1454433; CBET‐1512379","10.1002/aic.16273","","2022-06-23T00:00:00Z","1872911","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/1872911","https://www.osti.gov/servlets/purl/1872911","AIChE Journal","9","66"
"Development and Implementation of Fault-Correction Algorithms in Fault Detection and Diagnostics Tools","Lin, Guanjing; Pritoni, Marco; Chen, Yimin; Granderson, Jessica","24 POWER TRANSMISSION AND DISTRIBUTION; fault correction; fault detection and diagnostics; building operation; energy efficiency; field testing","A fault detection and diagnostics (FDD) tool is a type of energy management and information system that continuously identifies the presence of faults and efficiency improvement opportunities through a one-way interface to the building automation system and the application of automated analytics. Building operators on the leading edge of technology adoption use FDD tools to enable median whole-building portfolio savings of 8%. Although FDD tools can inform operators of operational faults, currently an action is always required to correct the faults to generate energy savings. A subset of faults, however, such as biased sensors, can be addressed automatically, eliminating the need for staff intervention. Automating this fault “correction” can significantly increase the savings generated by FDD tools and reduce the reliance on human intervention. Doing so is expected to advance the usability and technical and economic performance of FDD technologies. This paper presents the development of nine innovative fault auto-correction algorithms for Heating, Ventilation, and Air Conditioning pi(HVAC) systems. When the auto-correction routine is triggered, it overwrites control setpoints or other variables to implement the intended changes. It also discusses the implementation of the auto-correction algorithms in commercial FDD software products, the integration of these strategies with building automation systems and their preliminary testing.","MDPI AG","","Lawrence Berkeley National Lab.

An understanding of the regional and seasonal water stress impact of such water consumption is needed. In this study, we used a U.S. county-level water stress index, Available Water Remaining for the United States (AWARE-US), with facility-level thermoelectric power generation water consumption data, to quantify the regional and seasonal water stress impact of U.S. thermoelectric power plants. Water stress impact was evaluated as water-scarcity footprint (WSF) using monthly AWARE-US data. Results show that most thermoelectric power plants in the United States that use fresh water are in water-abundant regions. Our findings also show that a small fraction of the U.S. thermoelectric generation facilities (13% by power) located in water stressed regions contribute the most water stress impact (88% of the total WSF) caused by thermoelectric power generation in the U.S. Even if fresh water is abundant on an annual basis, many power plants are in counties with seasonal water shortages. Of the 401 counties with thermoelectric power plants using fresh water for cooling, 80 counties in February and 160 counties in August had fresh water withdrawal requirements that exceeded the sustainable fresh water available (availability minus demand or AMD) in that region. This means that 27% and 46% of power generation facilities have difficulty securing sustainable fresh water in February and August, respectively. This study is intended to support water consumption management in existing power plants and guide the deployment of future power plants to mitigate water stress impact.","Elsevier","","Argonne National Lab.

"Protection schemes used in North American microgrids","Piesciorovsky, Emilio Carlos; Smith, Travis; Ollis, Thomas Benjamin","24 POWER TRANSMISSION AND DISTRIBUTION; distributed generators; microgrid; power system protection; relaying","This study reviewed existing conventional and nonconventional protection schemes for grid-connected and islanded mode operations in North American microgrid projects. The microgrid projects investigated in this study used different types of distributed energy resources (DERs) and integrated hydropower/diesel generators, gas/steam/wind turbines, and photovoltaic systems with energy storage. In this work, conventional protection schemes were defined as those within the IEEE Standard C37.2-2008, whereas nonconventional schemes were those not defined within this standard. The pros and cons of conventional and nonconventional protection schemes were discussed in detail. The overvoltage, undervoltage, and frequency elements were the most common conventional protection schemes applied in microgrid projects in North America. These protection elements were used to detect the islanded conditions and faults that could not be sensed by overcurrent relays because of small fault currents contributed by low-inertia DERs and power-electronic sources. Directional overcurrent elements were used to distinguish between external (grid) and internal (microgrid) faults. Adaptive protection was the most popular nonconventional protection scheme applied to the microgrid projects. In conclusion, different types of DERs and operational modes must be considered in order to address the protection and control challenges of each microgrid and to obtain the best technical and economical solution.","Wiley","","Oak Ridge National Lab.

"Resilience framework and metrics for energy master planning of communities","Charani Shandiz, Saeid; Foliente, Greg; Rismanchi, Behzad; Wachtel, Amanda; Jeffers, Robert F.","24 POWER TRANSMISSION AND DISTRIBUTION","Changes in the nature, intensity, and frequency of climate-related extreme events have imposed a higher risk of failure on energy systems, especially those at the community level. Furthermore, the evolving energy demand patterns and transition towards renewable and localised energy supply can affect energy system resilience. How can an energy system be planned and reconfigured to address these challenges without compromising the system's resilience against chronic stresses and extreme events? Unlike energy system reliability, resilience is neither a common nor an explicit consideration in energy master planning at the community level. In addition, there is no universally agreed-upon method or metrics for measuring or estimating resilience and defining mitigation strategies. This paper introduces a multi-layered energy resilience framework and set of metrics for energy master planning of communities, including the new generation of district energy systems. The potential system disturbances and their short and long-term impacts on various components of the energy system are discussed for commonly expected and extreme events. Three layers of energy resilience are discussed: engineering-designed resilience, operational resilience, and community-societal resilience. A starting set of energy resilience metrics to support engineering design and energy master planning for communities is identified. Implications for future research and practice are noted.","Elsevier","","Sandia National Lab.

It usually has mandatory requirements for communication graph topology; changing the topology unexpectedly could disrupt the operation of a distributed controller. A denial of service (DoS) attack blocks communication channels to cause variations in communication graph. Unforeseen topology changes render a controller to receive incomplete system information. Control decisions made based on incorrect information can lead to significantly reduced grid supporting capability. As a result, the vital power balance between generation and load may be challenged. Determining power balance requires steady-state power flow analysis; however, the cyber-induced steady-state analysis is not well studied in the literature. Here, in this article, we show that a cyber–physical microgrid with unknown DoS attacks has augmented uncertain power flow equations, whose special structure creates new computational issue to determining power balance. To deal with the issue, we develop a novel cyber-induced microgrid model: the cyber–physical system is transformed into a pure physical model, where the disruption effects of DoS in the cyber layer are shown to be equivalent to the variations of the physical model parameters. With the transformed system, we develop a sufficient condition to ascertain the system power balance under unknown DoS attacks. In addition, practical insights for resilient distributed control design are shown as well.","IEEE","","Argonne National Lab.

Inertial control is designed by using generator torque limit considering the security of WTG system, while ESS releases its energy to compensate the sudden active power deficit during the recovery process of turbine rotor. WTG is modeled using the fatigue, aerodynamic, structure, turbulence (FAST) code, which identifies the mechanical loadings of the turbine and addresses electro-mechanical interactions in the wind energy system. A damping controller is augmented to the inertial control to suppress severe mechanical oscillations in the shaft and tower of the turbine during frequency supports. Furthermore, the result of small-signal stability analysis shows that the WTG-ESS tends to improve the stability of the whole multi-energy power grid. The major contributions of this paper will be validated by utilizing the proposed control method that combines the grid support capability and maintaining the integrity of structural design of the turbine for normal operations.","Springer","","National Renewable Energy Lab.

In this paper, the generic structure of advanced electrical test benches, including grid emulator or controllable grid interface, wind torque emulator, and device under test, is proposed to harmonize state-of-the-art test sites. On the other hand, modern wind turbines are under development towards new features, concerning grid-forming, black-start, and frequency support capabilities as well as harmonic stability and control interaction considerations, to secure the robustness and stability of renewable-energy-based power systems. Therefore, it is necessary to develop new and revised test standards and methodologies to address the new features of wind turbines. This paper proposes a generic test structure within two main groups, including open-loop and closed-loop tests. The open-loop tests include the IEC 61400-21-1 standard tests as well as the additional proposed test options for the new capabilities of wind turbines, which replicate grid connection compliance tests using open-loop references for the grid emulator. In addition, the closed-loop tests evaluate the device under test as part of a virtual wind power plant and perform real-time simulations considering the grid dynamics. The closed-loop tests concern grid connection topologies consisting of AC and HVDC, as well as different electrical characteristics, including impedance, short-circuit ratio, inertia, and background harmonics. The proposed tests can be implemented using available advanced test benches by adjusting their control systems. The characteristics of a real power system can be emulated by a grid emulator coupled with real-time digital simulator systems through a high-bandwidth power-hardware-in-the-loop interface.","European Wind Energy Association - Copernicus","","National Renewable Energy Lab.

"Enhancing the distribution grid resilience using cyber-physical oriented islanding strategy","An, Yu; Liu, Dong; Chen, Bo; Wang, Jianhui","24 POWER TRANSMISSION AND DISTRIBUTION","The increasing penetration of distributed generations enables an innovative operation paradigm that allows islanded operation to enhance the resilience of the distribution grid. In this study, a cyber-physical oriented islanding strategy is proposed by coordinating centralised and distributed control to achieve seamless islanding transition and operational flexibility in emergency conditions. A cyber-physical control structure is developed to mitigate various disturbances (e.g. emergencies or fluctuations) according to different operation conditions. Specifically, the distributed fault isolation and seamless islanding transition are coordinated to mitigate the outage caused by unplanned islanding, while a secondary control is proposed to support primary control by reducing the power fluctuations during islanded operation.

"Model predictive control for voltage restoration in microgrids using temporal logic specifications","Taousser, Fatima Z.; Olama, Mohammed M.; Djouadi, Seddik; Tomsovic, Kevin; Zhang, Yichen; Xue, Yaosuo","24 POWER TRANSMISSION AND DISTRIBUTION","Power system operation will encounter numerous voltage variabilities as the proliferation of renewable energy continues. Real-time monitoring and communication technologies can potentially improve voltage stability by enabling the rapid detection of voltage deviations and the implementation of corrective actions. These corrective actions will only be effective in restoring stability if they are chosen in a timely and scalable manner. This paper considers the problem of power systems’ load voltage control in order to simultaneously address both magnitude and time voltage specifications. In order to comply with grid codes and avoid unnecessary relay protection actions, a model predictive control (MPC)-based control strategy employing temporal logic specifications (TLSs) is proposed. The TLSs strategy is introduced as a formalism to control the voltage variation at a critical load bus against operational bounds over time. The control objective is to schedule optimal control input signals from the available supportive energy storage systems, which provide reactive power injections, leading to satisfying the specified finite-time restoration described by the TLSs with minimal control efforts. The simulation results display that the TLSs strategy for power systems’ voltage control synthesis is extremely significant.","The Institution of Engineering and Technology","","Oak Ridge National Lab.

"Low-Frequency Stability Analysis of Inverter-Based Islanded Multiple-Bus AC Microgrids Based on Terminal Characteristics","Cao, Wenchao; Ma, Yiwei; Wang, Fei; Tolbert, Leon M.; Xue, Yaosuo","24 POWER TRANSMISSION AND DISTRIBUTION; AC microgruids; droop control; impedance; inverters; small-signal stability; terminal characteristics","For system planning of three-phase inverter-based islanded ac microgrids, the low frequency instability issue caused by interactions of inverter droop controllers is a major concern. When internal control information of procured commercial inverters is unknown, impedance-based small-signal stability criteria facilitate prediction of resonances in medium and high frequency ranges, but they usually assume the grid fundamental frequency as constant and thus they are incapable of analyzing the low-frequency oscillation of the fundamental frequency in islanded microgrids. Aiming at solving this issue, this paper proposes two stability analysis methods based on terminal characteristics of inverters and passive connection network including the dynamics of the fundamental frequency for analysis of low-frequency stability in islanded multiple-bus microgrids. Based on the Component Connection Method (CCM) to systematically separate inverters from the passive connection network, a general approach is developed to model the microgrid as a multiple-input-multiple-output (MIMO) negative feedback system in the common system d-q reference frame. By applying the generalized Nyquist stability criterion (GNC) to the return-ratio and return-difference matrices of the MIMO system model, the low-frequency stability related to the fundamental frequency can be analyzed using the measured terminal characteristics of inverters. Finally, analysis and simulation of a 37-bus microgrid verify the effectiveness of the proposed stability analysis methods.","IEEE","","Oak Ridge National Lab.

The protection scheme is based on the current derivative algorithm. The overcurrent and current directional/differential comparison based protection schemes are incorporated for the dc microgrid fault characterization. For a low impedance fault, the fault current is controlled based on the current/voltage thresholds and current direction. Generally, the droop method is used to control the power-sharing between the converters by controlling the reference voltage. In this article, an adaptive droop scheme is also proposed to control the fault current by calculating a virtual resistance R droop , and to control the converter output reference voltage. For a high impedance fault, differential comparison method is used to characterize the fault. These algorithms effectively control the converter pulsewidth and reduce the flow of source current from a particular converter, which helps to increase the fault clearing time. Additionally, a trip signal is sent to the corresponding dc circuit breaker (DCCB), to isolate the faulted converter, feeder or a dc bus. The dc microgrid protection design procedure is detailed, and the performance of the proposed method is verified by simulation analysis.","IEEE","","Sandia National Lab.

"An Edge-Cloud Integrated Solution for Buildings Demand Response Using Reinforcement Learning","Zhang, Xiangyu; Biagioni, Dave; Cai, Mengmeng; Graf, Peter; Rahman, Saifur","32 ENERGY CONSERVATION, CONSUMPTION, AND UTILIZATION; 99 MATHEMATICS AND COMPUTING; 24 POWER TRANSMISSION AND DISTRIBUTION; air conditioning; demand response; reinforcement learning; smart building","Buildings, as major energy consumers, can provide great untapped demand response (DR) resources for grid services. However, their participation remains low in real-life. One major impediment for popularizing DR in buildings is the lack of cost-effective automation systems that can be widely adopted. Existing optimization-based smart building control algorithms suffer from high costs on both building-specific modeling and on-demand computing resources. To tackle these issues, this paper proposes a cost-effective edge-cloud integrated solution using reinforcement learning (RL). Beside RL’s ability to solve sequential optimal decision-making problems, its adaptability to easy-to-obtain building models and the off-line learning feature are likely to reduce the controller’s implementation cost. Using a surrogate building model learned automatically from building operation data, an RL agent learns an optimal control policy on cloud infrastructure, and the policy is then distributed to edge devices for execution. Simulation results demonstrate the control efficacy and the learning efficiency in buildings of different sizes. A preliminary cost analysis on a 4-zone commercial building shows the annual cost for optimal policy training is only 2.25% of the DR incentive received. Results of this study show a possible approach with higher return on investment for buildings to participate in DR programs.","IEEE","","National Renewable Energy Lab.

However, the widely installed PMUs are vulnerable to multiple malicious attacks from cyber hackers during data transmission and storage. To address this problem, a Modified Ensemble Empirical Mode Decomposition (MEEMD) is proposed first to extract the intrinsic mode functions of each Synchrophasor Data Attacks (SDA). The frequency-based adaptive screening criterion embedded in MEEMD is used to eliminate the false intrinsic mode functions. Next, a Multivariate Convolutional Neural Network (MCNN) is proposed to identify multiple SDA by utilizing the extracted intrinsic mode functions and original SDA as input vectors. A fusion block as the main structure of MCNN is also leveraged to increase the diversity of features and compress the model parameters. Integrating MEEMD and MCNN, a framework with automatic feature extraction and multi-source information fusion capability, referred to as Feature Interactive Network (FIN), is proposed to detect multiple SDA. Based on the proposed FIN framework, six types of SDA are explored for the first time using actual synchrophasor data in FNET/Grideye that was collected from different locations in the U.S. Eastern Interconnection.

However, performing utility-scale segmentation for unobservable customers with only monthly billing information, remains a challenging problem. To address this challenge, we propose a new metric, the coincident monthly peak contribution (CMPC), that quantifies the contribution of individual customers to system peak demand. Furthermore, a novel multi-state machine learning-based segmentation method is developed that estimates CMPC for customers without smart meters (SMs): first, a clustering technique is used to build a databank containing typical daily load patterns in different seasons using the SM data of observable customers. Next, to associate unobservable customers with the discovered typical load profiles, a classification approach is leveraged to compute the likelihood of daily consumption patterns for different unobservable households. In the third stage, a weighted clusterwise regression (WCR) model is utilized to estimate the CMPC of unobservable customers using their monthly billing data and the outcomes of the classification module. Furthermore, the proposed segmentation methodology has been tested and verified using real utility data.","IEEE","","Iowa State Univ., Ames, IA (United States)","USDOE Office of Electricity (OE); National Science Foundation (NSF)","","United States","2020-03-10T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: IEEE Transactions on Power Systems; Journal Volume: 35; Journal Issue: 5","","Medium: ED; Size: p. 4026-4035","","","OE0000875; ECCS 1929975","Journal ID: ISSN 0885-8950","10.1109/tpwrs.2020.2979943","","2023-03-17T00:00:00Z","1961209","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/1961209","https://www.osti.gov/servlets/purl/1961209","IEEE Transactions on Power Systems","5","35"

Because of their ability to flexibly adjust power generation in real time, gas-fired power plants are frequently seen as the perfect partner for variable renewable generation. However, this reliance on gas generation increases interdependence and propagates uncertainty between power grids and gas pipelines and brings coordination and uncertainty management challenges. To address these issues, we propose an uncertainty management framework for uncertain, but bounded gas consumption by gas-fired power plants. The admissible ranges are computed based on a joint optimization problem for the combined gas and electricity networks, which involves chance-constrained scheduling for the electric grid and a novel robust optimization formulation for the natural-gas network. This formulation ensures feasibility of the integrated system with a high probability, while providing a tractable numerical formulation. A key advance with respect to existing methods is that our method is based on a physically accurate, validated model for transient gas pipeline flows. Our case study benchmarks our proposed formulation against methods that ignore how reserve activation impacts the fuel use of gas power plants and only consider predetermined gas consumption. Here, the results demonstrate the importance of considering uncertainty to avoid operating constraint violations and curtailment of gas to the generators.","Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers","","Los Alamos National Lab.

These lead to the difficulty of developing appropriate dynamic modeling, and thus an efficient control strategy. To avoid such modeling challenges, here we present a novel dynamic voltage control strategy based on a model-free control (MFC) approach, requiring no modeling procedure. In particular, it focuses on fault-induced delayed voltage recovery (FIDVR) events, which require complex and accurate dynamic load models to replicate such events. This work utilizes MFC as an online controller to achieve the desired voltage stability under the FIDVR event. The proposed MFC strategy allows simple implementation and low computational cost for efficient mitigation of FIDVR. For benchmarking, a reasonably accurate dynamic performance model is explored. Simulation results with the IEEE 57 bus test network demonstrate the enhanced dynamic voltage profile for load buses having induction motors with the support of reactive power resources.","IEEE","","Oak Ridge National Lab.

This study aims to quantify the influence of phase information on the device power output of a virtual WEC array. We run the phase-resolving wave model FUNWAVE-TVD (Total Variation Diminishing) to generate directional waves at the PacWave South site offshore from Newport, Oregon, where future WECs are expected to be installed for testing. The two broad cases presented correspond to mean wave climates during warm months (March–August) and cold months (September–February). FUNWAVE-TVD time series of sea-surface elevation are then used in WEC-Sim, a time domain numerical model, to simulate the hydrodynamic response of each device in the array and estimate their power output. For comparison, WEC-Sim is also run with wave energy spectra calculated from the FUNWAVE-TVD simulations, which do not retain phase information, and with wave spectra computed using the phase-averaged model Simulating WAves Nearshore (SWAN). The use of spectral data in WEC-Sim requires a conversion from frequency to time domain by means of random superposition of wave components, which are not necessarily consistent because of the linear assumption implicit in this method. Thus, power response is characterized by multiple realizations of the wave climates.","MDPI","","Pacific Northwest National Lab. (PNNL), Richland, WA (United States); National Renewable Energy Lab.

"Direct Phase-Angle Detection for Three-Phase Inverters in Asymmetrical Power Grids","Sadeque, Fahmid; Benzaquen, Joseph; Adib, Aswad; Mirafzal, Behrooz","24 POWER TRANSMISSION AND DISTRIBUTION; Phase-angle detection; phase-locked loops (PLLs); signal reformation; smart inverters; three-phase asymmetrical grids","This paper introduces a signal reformation based direct phase-angle detection (DPD-SR) technique for three-phase inverters supporting asymmetrical grids. Asymmetries in three-phase systems may happen because of unbalanced three-phase loads, which can lead to the voltage asymmetry at the terminals of grid-tied inverters. The proposed DPD-SR technique can detect the voltage phase-angle under asymmetrical conditions. The DPD-SR technique also offers precise and rapid phase-angle detection via signal reformation and trigonometric functions. In essence, the phase-angle detection is directly derived from the trigonometric properties of the line-line voltages, while signal reformation is implemented to handle asymmetrical voltages. The proposed method measures two line-line voltages and detects the phase-angle of a three-phase system under both symmetrical and asymmetrical conditions. Unlike classical phase-locked loop (PLL) techniques, DPD-SR does not need any closed-loop PI controller, which significantly reduces the complexity and the delay in detecting the phase-angle. In this paper, the efficacy of the proposed technique is examined in comparison with the state-of-the-art PLLs under asymmetrical conditions via a set of laboratory experiments. Here, the performance of the phase-angle detection is also tested as part of an inverter feeding an asymmetrical grid.","IEEE","","Kansas State Univ., Manhattan, KS (United States)","USDOE Office of Energy Efficiency and Renewable Energy (EERE), Renewable Power Office.

"Selling Demand Response Using Options","Muthirayan, Deepan; Kalathil, Dileep; Li, Sen; Poolla, Kameshwar; Varaiya, Pravin","24 POWER TRANSMISSION AND DISTRIBUTION","Wholesale electricity markets in many jurisdictions use a two-settlement structure: a day-ahead market for bulk power transactions and a real-time market for fine-grain supply-demand balancing. This paper explores trading demand response assets within this two-settlement market structure. Here, we consider two approaches for trading demand response assets: (a) an intermediate spot market with contingent pricing, and (b) an over-the-counter options contract. In the first case, we characterize the competitive equilibrium of the spot market, and show that it is socially optimal. Economic orthodoxy advocates spot markets, but these require expensive infrastructure and regulatory blessing. In the second case, we characterize competitive equilibria and compare its efficiency with the idealized spot market. Options contract are private bilateral over-the-counter transactions and do not require regulatory approval. We show that the optimal social welfare is, in general, not supported. We then design optimal option prices that minimize the social welfare gap. This optimal design serves to approximate the ideal spot market for demand response using options with modest loss of efficiency. Our results are validated through numerical simulations.","IEEE","","Lawrence Berkeley National Lab.

"Reducing the computational burden of a microgrid energy management system","Mcilvenna, Amelia; Herron Jr, Drew; Hambrick, Joshua; Ollis, Ben; Ostrowski, Jim","42 ENGINEERING; 24 POWER TRANSMISSION AND DISTRIBUTION","As renewable technology advances and decreases in cost, microgrids are becoming an appealing means of distributed generation both for isolated communities and integrated with existing electrical grid systems. Due to their small size, however, microgrids may have financial limitations which preclude them from using commercial software to optimize control of their assets. Open-source optimization solvers are a viable alternative, but increase computation time. This work expands on a rolling horizon optimization framework for economic dispatch within an existing residential microgrid located in Hoover, Alabama. The microgrid has an open-source solver requirement and a need for quick solution time on a rolling horizon as opposed to a day-ahead commitment. We present a method of reducing integer variables by relaxation which completes two goals: reduction in computation time for real-time operations, and reduction in daily operational cost for the microgrid. Seasonal data for load and photovoltaic (PV) power was also collected from the microgrid to facilitate simulation testing. Computation time was successfully reduced using multiple variations of the relaxation method, while obtaining solution quality with operational cost similar to or better than the original model.","Elsevier","","Oak Ridge National Lab.

"Optimal D-FACTS Placement in Moving Target Defense Against False Data Injection Attacks","Liu, Bo; Wu, Hongyu","24 POWER TRANSMISSION AND DISTRIBUTION; false data injection attacks; moving target defense; D-FACTS placement; topology analysis","Moving target defense (MTD) is a defense strategy to detect stealthy false data injection (FDI) attacks against the power system state estimation using distributed flexible AC transmission system (D-FACTS) devices. However, existing studies neglect to address a fundamental yet critical issue, i.e., the D-FACTS placement, by assuming that all lines are equipped with D-FACTS devices. Here, to tackle this problem, we first derive analytical necessary conditions and requirements on the D-FACTS placement for a complete MTD. Further, we propose sufficient conditions using a graph theory-based topology analysis to ensure that the MTD under the proposed D-FACTS placement has the maximum rank of its composite matrix, which is indicative of the MTD effectiveness. Based on the analytical conditions, we design D-FACTS placement algorithms by using the minimum number of D-FACTS devices to achieve the maximum MTD effectiveness. A novel MTD-based ACOPF model, in which the reactance of D-FACTS lines is introduced as decision variables, is proposed to find a trade-off between the system loss and the MTD effectiveness. Numerical results on 6-bus, IEEE 14-bus, and IEEE 118-bus systems show the efficacy of MTDs using the proposed D-FACTS placement algorithms in maximizing the composite matrix rank and detecting FDI attacks.","IEEE","","Kansas State Univ., Manhattan, KS (United States)","USDOE Office of Energy Efficiency and Renewable Energy (EERE), Renewable Power Office.

Grid stability assessment requires a faithful representation of the multiple-physics interaction at the system level, and timescales of interaction varying in orders of magnitude, from microseconds to seconds to several minutes. Along with the simulation-based techniques, hardware-in-the-loop (HIL), controller HIL, and power HIL techniques have been developed to better understand the emergent behavior of the system with emerging technologies. US National Laboratories have played a vital role in research and development to understand the behavior of individual technologies and devices integrated to the electric grid. Each national laboratory forwards a technological and strategic initiative tied core and enabling capabilities. Due to strategic, efficiency, and economic reasons, not all the labs have assets to conduct research on all technologies concomitantly, so it becomes crucial to integrate the labs across geographies to understand the interplay of different technologies together at the system level. This approach avoids duplication of the assets at different lab facilities and helps understand the integrated system behavior of various technologies representative of actual grid conditions by connecting multiple national labs. This article talks about techniques of connecting three national laboratories to enable co-emulation of electrical–mechanical–thermal characteristics of devices and systems. Such an approach can be used to understand the dynamic and transient interaction of multi-physics in a system level, at-scale emulation using real-time simulation tools and techniques.","ASME","","National Renewable Energy Lab.

"Modeling and Harmonic Stability of MMC-HVDC With Passive Circulating Current Filters","Zhang, Bo; Nademi, Hamed","24 POWER TRANSMISSION AND DISTRIBUTION; Modular Multilevel Converter (MMC); Passive Circulating Current Filter; Harmonic Stability; power system stability","A modular multilevel converter (MMC) is an emerging converter technology widely used in wind power applications using high-voltage direct current (HVDC) transmission, and it has been largely investigated in medium-voltage solar harvesting as well as electric motor drives. Different from studies dealing with active circulating current control loops, this paper focuses on impedance modeling and harmonic stability studies for MMCs with passive circulating current filters (PCCFs). A power stage circuit including a PCCF is transformed and remodeled to obtain small-signal formulations. This transformation leads to additional high-order matrix computing complexity due to the added impedance subnetwork matrix from the PCCF as well as relevant crossed-frequency impacts. To simplify the computational burden, the proposed model aims to solve one arm equation instead of all six MMC arm equations. To achieve this result, additional challenges occur when the MMC is connected to a renewable energy source instead of the grid voltage, where low-level zero-sequence components might exist in the neutral point of three phases, especially in the case of no integrated advanced modular voltage balancing control, which prevents computational simplification. To overcome this challenge, further impedance matrix adjustments are conducted in this paper to theoretically suppress the impact of zero-sequence harmonics when obtaining small-signal impedance, taking into account the frequency coupling effect. Finally, simulations are carried out to validate the developed impedance model under different operating scenarios. Harmonic stability case studies of MMCs with PCCFs connected to renewable energy current sources are also presented, where frequency-domain stability analyses based on Bode diagrams are compared to time-domain simulation waveforms and FFTs, which validate the effectiveness of the proposed impedance model.","IEEE","","Idaho National Lab.

In addition, a continuous-time day-ahead operation model is developed to commit and schedule an adequate subset of generating units for providing balancing energy and ramping requirements in real-time operation. The up and down flexible ramp products are defined as continuous-time decision trajectories that continuously supply the real-time up and down ramping requirements of the system. The deliverability of flexible ramp products is secured through reserving the respective power requirements in generation capacity constraints of generating units. A function space solution method is proposed to reduce the dimensionality of day-ahead and real-time models through projecting them into finite-dimensional function spaces spanned by Bernstein polynomials, where the real-time operation decisions are modeled with a higher accuracy level than day-ahead decisions. Simulations are conducted on the IEEE-RTS system using CAISO load data, and the numerical results showcase the effectiveness of the proposed model in supplying the energy and flexible ramp requirements and avoiding ramping scarcity in the system, while reducing the operation costs.","Elsevier","","Univ. of Utah, Salt Lake City, UT (United States)","USDOE Office of Electricity (OE)","","United States","2020-02-20T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: International Journal of Electrical Power and Energy Systems; Journal Volume: 119","","Medium: ED; Size: Article No. 105895","","","OE0000882","Journal ID: ISSN 0142-0615; PII: S0142061519338967","10.1016/j.ijepes.2020.105895","","2022-05-20T00:00:00Z","1801337","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/1801337","https://www.osti.gov/servlets/purl/1801337","International Journal of Electrical Power and Energy Systems","","119"

In this work, we investigate cascading outage mitigation under severe weather conditions. Given day-ahead weather forecasts and component failure models, we aim to identify a set of power lines that can be hardened to minimize the expected impact of potential cascading outages. Since the expected load shedding cannot be expressed as an explicit function of line hardening decisions and system states, we developed a cascading outage simulator to estimate the expected value of load shedding under various initial weather-related disruption scenarios generated using a weather forecast. To avoid massive enumeration of all possible combinations of line hardening decisions and reduce the simulation efforts, we employed an efficient simulation-based optimization approach that quickly identifies the (near) optimal line hardening decisions in the presence of both large simulation noises due to the highly variable initial disturbances and system states, and significant randomness in the subsequent cascades. Furthermore, the algorithm is also able to utilize parallel computing to dramatically reduce computation time to support decision making in preparation for severe weather conditions. We performed a case study on the Northeast Power Coordinating Council (NPCC) 140-bus system model to demonstrate that our approach can significantly improve power grid resilience to adverse weather events.","IEEE","","Argonne National Lab.

This paper proposes a data-based robust optimization (RO) model to enhance the resilience of the integrated electricity and gas system (IEGS) against SEWEs. Specifically, the SEWE strikes the IEGS sequentially. After each attack, the system state is adjusted immediately to minimize the maximized expected system cost caused by the SEWE. The attack-defense procedures are repeated alternatively during the SEWE. Preventive measures, hardening, are made in advance to reduce the impact of sequential attacks. The entire process is formulated as a multi-period RO model. Furthermore, it is proved that the most effective resilience enhancement strategies for this model are the same as those for a two-stage RO model, which can be solved by the nested column-and-constraint generation (C&CG) algorithm. In addition, the property of SEWEs, sequentially endangering limited regions of the IEGS, is incorporated to build a data-based uncertainty set and reduce its conservativeness. Simulation results on two IEGSs validate the effectiveness of the proposed model.","IEEE","","Univ. of Central Florida, Orlando, FL (United States)","USDOE","","United States","2020-07-07T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: IEEE Transactions on Smart Grid; Journal Volume: 11; Journal Issue: 6","","Medium: ED; Size: p. 5383-5395","","","EE0007998","Journal ID: ISSN 1949-3053; 51677160; GRF17207818; T23-701/14-N; ECCS-1552073","10.1109/tsg.2020.3007479","","2021-09-22T00:00:00Z","1820628","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/1820628","https://www.osti.gov/servlets/purl/1820628","IEEE Transactions on Smart Grid","6","11"

This setup provides a complete simulation solution to capture fast transient signals required for high-bandwidth controller design and protection studies without any compromise; ii) implements the first GPU-based simulation architecture and corresponding algorithms for MTdc-ac grids with real-time performance at scales of 1s; iii) is highly-efficient and balances the high utilization of GPU resources and low latency required for the simulation; and iv) outperforms the existing central processing unit (CPU)- or digital signal processor (DSP)/field-programmable gate array (FPGA)-based simulators in terms of its higher scalability on large-scale MTdc-ac grids and superior price-performance ratio on the hardware. Accuracy and performance of the proposed platform are evaluated with respect to the reference results from PSCAD/EMTDC environment.","IEEE","","Oak Ridge National Lab.

"Real Time Effective Impedance Estimation for Power System State Estimation","Moffat, Keith; Bariya, Mohini; Von Meier, Alexandra","24 POWER TRANSMISSION AND DISTRIBUTION; impedance estimation; state estimation; smart grid; real-time; analytics; data-driven; PMUs","Here, we introduce two tools-the Effective Impedance State Estimator (EISE), and the Real Time Effective Impedance Estimator (RTEIE). The EISE is novel in that it is an entirely data-driven state estimator, and does not require a network model. Thus, the EISE is well suited for applications in which an accurate network model is not available. Instead of using a network impedance model, the EISE uses an effective impedance network model that is learned online by the RTEIE. The RTEIE recursively estimates the effective impedance network model using phasor measurement unit (PMU) measurements. The mathematical reasoning for using an effective impedance model, rather than a full network impedance model, is given. The recursive estimation framework allows the RTEIE to take the entire history of phasor measurements into account to produce a model estimate, while still adjusting to changes in the network impedance due to external factors such as topology changes and temperature. The merits of the RTEIE and EISE are demonstrated by comparing the accuracy of the EISE with a conventional state estimator on a toy network.","IEEE","","Univ. of California, Berkeley, CA (United States)","USDOE Office of Energy Efficiency and Renewable Energy (EERE), Renewable Power Office.

"Physics-guided Deep Learning for Power System State Estimation","Wang, Lei; Zhou, Qun; Jin, Shuangshuang","24 POWER TRANSMISSION AND DISTRIBUTION; State estimation; deep learning; deep neural network (DNN); temporal correlation; power system","In the past decade, dramatic progress has been made in the field of machine learning. This paper explores the possibility of applying deep learning in power system state estimation. Traditionally, physics-based models are used including weighted least square (WLS) or weighted least absolute value (WLAV). These models typically consider a single snapshot of the system without capturing temporal correlations of system states. In this paper, a physics-guided deep learning (PGDL) method is proposed. Specifically, inspired by autoencoders, deep neural networks (DNNs) are used to learn the temporal correlations. The estimated system states from DNNs are then checked against physics laws by running through a set of power flow equations. Hence, the proposed PGDL is both data-driven and physics-guided. The accuracy and robustness of the proposed PGDL method are compared with traditional methods in standard IEEE cases. Simulations show promising results and the applicability is further discussed.","Springer","","Univ. of Central Florida, Orlando, FL (United States)","USDOE Office of Energy Efficiency and Renewable Energy (EERE), Renewable Power Office.

This process is known to produce a strong UV emission. In this work, the roles of optical absorption, photochemistry, shock sensitivity, and impact sensitivity are assessed with respect to the relative roles each plays in the operation of an EBW detonator. The optical absorptivity and penetration depth have been measured using dilute polycrystalline samples of PETN, RDX, HMX, CL-20 and HNS in KBr between 190 and 1100 nm. The results show strong absorption at UV wavelengths with a gradual decline at longer ones. It is found that while strong UV absorption appears to be necessary, it is not sufficient to make an effective EBW detonator.","Taylor & Francis","","Los Alamos National Lab.

"A Two-Stage Decomposition Approach for AC Optimal Power Flow","Tu, Shenyinying; Wachter, Andreas; Wei, Ermin","24 POWER TRANSMISSION AND DISTRIBUTION; Optimal power flow; decomposition; transmission networks; distribution networks; primal-dual interior point method; two-stage optimization; smoothing technique; stochastic optimization","The alternating current optimal power flow (AC-OPF) problem is critical to power system operations and planning, but it is generally hard to solve due to its nonconvex and large-scale nature. Furthermore, this paper proposes a scalable decomposition approach in which the power network is decomposed into a master network and a number of subnetworks, where each network has its own AC-OPF subproblem. This formulates a two-stage optimization problem and requires only a small amount of communication between the master and subnetworks. The key contribution is a smoothing technique that renders the response of a subnetwork differentiable with respect to the input from the master problem, utilizing properties of the barrier problem formulation that naturally arises when subproblems are solved by a primal-dual interior-point algorithm. Consequently, existing efficient nonlinear programming solvers can be used for both the master problem and the subproblems. The advantage of this framework is that speedup can be obtained by processing the subnetworks in parallel, and it has convergence guarantees under reasonable assumptions. The formulation is readily extended to instances with stochastic subnetwork loads. Numerical results show favorable performance and illustrate the scalability of the algorithm which is able to solve instances with more than 11 million buses.","IEEE","","Los Alamos National Lab.

"A Scalable and Distributed Algorithm for Managing Residential Demand Response Programs using Alternating Direction Method of Multipliers (ADMM)","Starke, Michael; Zandi, Helia; Munk, Jeffrey; Olama, Mohammed M.; Dong, Jin; Kou, Xiao; Xue, Yaosuo; Li, Fangxing","24 POWER TRANSMISSION AND DISTRIBUTION","For effective engagement of residential demand-side resources and to ensure efficient operation of distribution networks, we must overcome the challenges of controlling and coordinating residential components and devices at scale. To overcome this challenge, we present a distributed and scalable algorithm with a three-level hierarchical information exchange architecture for managing the residential demand response programs. First, a centralized optimization model is formulated to maximize community social welfare. Then, this centralized model is solved in a distributed manner with alternating direction method of multipliers (ADMM) by decomposing the original problem to utility-level and house-level problems. The information exchange between the different layers is limited to the primary residual (i.e., supply-demand mismatch), Lagrangian multipliers, and the total load of each house to protect each customer’s privacy. Simulation studies are performed on the IEEE 33 bus test system with 605 residential customers. The results demonstrate that the proposed approach can save customers’ electricity bills and reduce the peak load at the utility level without much affecting customers’ comfort and privacy. Finally, a quantitative comparison of the distributed and centralized algorithms shows the scalability advantage of the proposed ADMM-based approach, and it gives benchmarking results with achievable value for future research works.","IEEE","","Oak Ridge National Lab.

Two new 500 kVA distribution network transformers were built with embedded fiber-optic (FO) sensors and qualified per industry standards. Vibration, temperature, and corrosion were key parameters monitored. The first transformer with embedded FO sensors was installed at a Con Edison facility and monitored at our team’s office. The second one was installed in an urban street-side underground location with online data processing/feature extraction algorithms and monitored through a wireless router. Additionally, an older transformer was also retrofitted. Data analysis was done on these transformers showing promising correlations with their corresponding loading cycles. Furthermore, key events such as the transformer primary-side energizing, and other events were detected. In general, the technology was demonstrated over 6 months across the 3 transformers instrumented with promising results.

It is now important to quantify the amount of solar energy curtailed as a result of the activation of inverter grid support functions (GSFs). This paper proposes a methodology for estimating customer impact of volt-watt on customer PV energy curtailment using smart meter voltage data. This method estimates maximum possible curtailment for a given volt-watt curve based on the customer smart meter voltage over the time period of interest. This study compares the proposed methodology with actual field measurements using irradiance and customer inverter data in Hawaii, as well as with results from a previous simulation-driven study on the impact of advanced inverter GSFs activation on PV energy curtailment. Results show that our proposed method for estimating lost PV production caused by volt-watt control aligns reasonably well with field measurements and computer simulation for hundreds of customers. The proposed method could be used to estimate customer energy curtailment, which can inform future compensation mechanisms for utilities leveraging customer-sited resources to mitigate high-voltage and defer or avoid future infrastructure upgrades.","","","National Renewable Energy Lab.

"Compounding climate change impacts during high stress periods for a high wind and solar power system in Texas","Craig, Michael; Jaramillo, Paulina; Hodge, Brian S; Nijssen, Bart; Brancucci, Carlo","24 POWER TRANSMISSION AND DISTRIBUTION; 29 ENERGY PLANNING, POLICY, AND ECONOMY; power system; climate change; wind; solar; Texas","Power system planning aims at ensuring that sufficient supply- and demand-side assets exist to meet electricity demand at all times. For a Texas electric power system with high wind and solar penetrations, we quantify how climate change will affect supply and demand during three types of high stress periods for the power grid: high demand hours, high net demand hours, and high system ramp hours. We specifically quantify effects on demand, reductions in available thermal capacity (i.e. thermal deratings), wind and solar generation, and net demand. We estimate each using meteorological variables from five climate change projections (2041-2050) assuming Representative Concentration Pathway 8.5 and from a reference period (1996-2005). All five projections indicate that climate change will increase demand by up to 2 GWh during high demand hours (4% of demand in the reference period) and increase net demand by up to 3 GWh during high net demand periods (6% of net demand in the reference period). All five projections also indicate thermal deratings will increase during high demand and net demand periods by up to 2 GWh and high net demand ramps will increase by up to 2 GW. Overall, our results indicate compounding effects of climate change in Texas will necessitate greater investment in peak and flexible capacity.","IOP Publishing","","National Renewable Energy Lab.

This paper proposes a copula-based Bayesian approach to improve probabilistic solar power forecasting by capturing the joint distribution between solar power and ambient temperature. A prior forecast distribution is first obtained using different underlying point forecasting models. Parametric and empirical copulas of solar power and temperature are then developed to update the prior distribution to the posterior forecast distribution. A public solar power database is used to demonstrate effectiveness of the proposed method. Numerical results show that the copula-based Bayesian method outperforms the forecasting method that directly uses temperature as a feature. The Bayesian method is also compared with persistent models and show improved performance.

"A Mid-Term DSO Market for Capacity Limits: How to Estimate Opportunity Costs of Aggregators?","Ziras, Charalampos; Kazempour, Jalal; Kara, Emre Can; Bindner, Henrik W.; Pinson, Pierre; Kiliccote, Sila","24 POWER TRANSMISSION AND DISTRIBUTION","A large number of mechanisms are proposed to manage potential problems in distribution networks caused by the participation of distributed energy resources (DERs) in the wholesale markets. In this paper, we first introduce a practical and straightforward mechanism, based on capacity limits , which avoids conflicts between the transmission system operator and the distribution system operators (DSOs). Using a large number of real electric vehicle (EV) commercial charging stations we then show how an EV aggregator can forecast the opportunity cost incurred by offering a mid-term capacity limit service to the DSO. This cost is computed based on the estimated profit that the aggregator could gain in the day-ahead and real-time markets. The proposed methodology guarantees robustness against evolving EV uncertainty, both in terms of service delivery and driving requirements. It also allows the use of a variety of time-series forecasting methods without forecasting electricity prices and EV scenarios.

"A Data-Driven Nonparametric Approach for Probabilistic Load-Margin Assessment Considering Wind Power Penetration","Xu, Yijun; Mili, Lamine; Korkali, Mert; Karra, Kiran; Zheng, Zongsheng; Chen, Xiao","42 ENGINEERING; 24 POWER TRANSMISSION AND DISTRIBUTION; 97 MATHEMATICS AND COMPUTING; 17 WIND ENERGY; probabilistic load margin; data-driven nonparametric model; reduced-order modeling; dependence; vine copula; uncertainty","A modern power system is characterized by an increasing penetration of wind power, which results in large uncertainties in its states. These uncertainties must be quantified properly; otherwise, the system security may be threatened. Facing this challenge, here we propose a cost-effective, data-driven approach to assessing a power system's load margin probabilistically. Using actual wind data, a kernel density estimator is applied to infer the nonparametric wind speed distributions, which are further merged into the framework of a vine copula. The latter enables us to simulate complex multivariate and highly dependent model inputs with a variety of bivariate copulae that precisely represent the tail dependence in the correlated samples. Furthermore, to reduce the prohibitive computational time of traditional Monte-Carlo simulations that process a large amount of samples, we propose to use a nonparametric, Gaussian-process-emulator-based reduced-order model to replace the original complicated continuation power-flow model through a Bayesian-learning framework. To accelerate the convergence rate of this Bayesian algorithm, a truncated polynomial chaos surrogate, which serves as a highly efficient, parametric Bayesian prior, is developed. This emulator allows us to execute the time-consuming continuation power-flow solver at the sampled values with a negligible computational cost. Results of simulations that are performed on several test systems reveal the impressive performance of the proposed method in the probabilistic load-margin assessment.","IEEE","External Audience (Unlimited)","Lawrence Livermore National Lab.

Particularly, the development and verification stage of HPP controls requires reduced-order models to minimize the complexity and computation effort of simulation platforms. In this paper, such models are proposed, and the most essential parts of the models are validated through field measurements. The models target power system integration studies involving active and reactive power, as well as frequency and voltage regulation where detailed models, as proposed in the standards, can be cumbersome. Field measurements of two Vestas WTGs, one 1-MW PV plant, and one 1-MW/1-MWh BESS are used for model validation. The results show that the WTG and PV performance models correctly estimate the power generation variability according to fluctuations in wind speed and solar irradiance. The BESS performance model provides satisfactory results related to grid-forming control performance and estimation of state-of-charge. The presented validation work enables using the proposed performance models for power system studies and HPP control design in all model-based design stages, that is, preliminary analysis, design, verification, and validation with a high level of confidence.</p>","MDPI AG","","National Renewable Energy Lab.

To control such a unique MG and realise the dynamic boundary, an MG central controller and two types of local controllers are implemented. Compared to the MG with fixed boundary, the MG with dynamic boundary can have smaller BESS capacity, better utilisation of renewable energy, and multiple POI options.

Despite obstacles around hardware, market structure, and lack of experience, demand response is an important source of flexibility that complements more conventional supply-side flexibility resources. However, accurate representations of demand response in production cost models employed for grid systems analyses have been limited by incomplete formulations, inadequate real-world data, case studies with narrow applicability, and a finite list of end uses and sectors. This paper proposes a suite of demand response constraints that capture more-realistic demand response operational limitations including uptimes and downtimes, numbers of starts per day, allowable power limits, and required recovery periods. The proposed demand response implementation is tested with real-world load data for Bangalore, India. The results show that demand response reduces production costs primarily by facilitating the substitution of high-marginal-cost thermal generators with near-zero-marginal-cost renewables. Overall, demand response utilization rates are most constrained by their maximum allowable daily deployment, but intraday recovery constraints govern their operational behavior. In addition to the significant value that demand response provides to the grid, demand response aggregators can expect substantial revenues from price arbitrage.","","","National Renewable Energy Lab.

In these systems, consensus algorithms determine the average of a group of dynamic states (e.g. voltages measured by a group of DGs). To be useful, consensus algorithms must be computationally efficient, stable and accurate. In practice, numerous practical implementation challenges significantly affect the consensus equilibrium. In this paper, we quantify the accuracy deviations of the distributed average observer algorithms proposed in the literature to demonstrate the problems with the state-of-the-art distributed averaging techniques. A novel approach is proposed that achieves accurate average tracking in the presence of time-varying communication delays among agents. In our implementation, time synchronization of all distributed controllers is enabled by a novel software platform, called Resilient Information Architecture Platform for the Smart Grid (RIAPS).

The proposed implementation significantly reduces the computation loads compared to the centrally coordinated implementation of the same primal-dual algorithm without compromising optimality. Numerical findings on a 4,521-node test feeder show that the designed algorithm achieves more than 10-fold acceleration in the speed of convergence compared to the centrally coordinated primal-dual algorithm through reducing and distributing computational loads.","IEEE","","National Renewable Energy Lab.

"A Hybrid-Learning Algorithm for Online Dynamic State Estimation in Multimachine Power Systems","Tian, Guanyu; Zhou, Qun; Birari, Rahul; Qi, Junjian; Qu, Zhihua","24 POWER TRANSMISSION AND DISTRIBUTION; Dynamic state estimation (DSE); hybrid learning; neural networks; phasor measurement units (PMUs); synchronous generators","With the increasing penetration of distributed generators in the smart grids, having knowledge of rapid real-time electromechanical dynamic states has become crucial to system stability control. Conventional Supervisory Control and Data Acquisition (SCADA)-based dynamic state estimation (DSE) techniques are limited by the slow sampling rates, while the emerging phasor measurement units (PMUs) technology enables rapid real-time measurements at network nodes. Using generator bus terminal voltages, we propose a hybrid-learning DSE (HL-DSE) algorithm to estimate the synchronous machine rotor angle and speed in real time. The HL-DSE takes the power system model into account and trains neuroestimators with real-time data in an online manner. Compared with traditional DSE methods, the HL-DSE overcomes limitations by using a data-driven approach in conjunction with the physical power system model. The time efficiency, accuracy, convergence, and robustness of the proposed algorithm are tested under noises and fault conditions in both small- and large-scale test systems.

Controlled islanding is the last measure to prevent power system blackouts, thus this paper aims to propose a novel model of system separation based on Online Coherency Identification and Adjustable Robust Optimization Programming (OCI-AROP) for minimizing load shedding considering the uncertainties of RES. First, Fuzzy C-Means (FCM) clustering method with F-statistics is utilized to identify the coherent generator groups with the frequency data measured by Phasor Measurement Units (PMUs). Then, the OCI-AROP model considering coherent group constraints, connectivity constraints and robustness constraints about RES are presented.

"The Dominant Influencer of Voltage Fluctuation (DIVF) for Power Distribution System","Jhala, Kumarsinh; Natarajan, Balasubramaniam; Pahwa, Anil","24 POWER TRANSMISSION AND DISTRIBUTION; Active Consumers; Control; Distributed Generation; Power Distribution; Probability; Voltage","Variability in power generation at multiple consumer owned renewable energy sources can cause random voltage fluctuations, which may result in voltage violations at multiple nodes in a power distribution system. Traditional methods of voltage control are ineffective to address fast voltage variations. New dynamic methods of voltage control using end user devices can significantly benefit from the knowledge of the dominant influencer of voltage fluctuation (DIVF). This paper introduces information theoretic metrics to identify DIVF for every node in the power distribution system. A node can be DIVF due to its location in the distribution system and its capacity to generate and change its power. Use of traditional power flow algorithms to identify the DIVF is computationally complex which limits their use in real-time applications. In this work, information theoretic indicators of the DIVF are computed analytically in a computationally efficient manner, and their effectiveness to identify the DIVF is tested using the IEEE 69 node test system. From simulations, it is illustrated that differential entropy, Kullback-Leibler distance and Frechet distance are effective indicators of the DIVF and can successfully identify the most influential nodes providing the foundation for intelligent voltage control.","IEEE","","Argonne National Lab.

The existing DC loads in various products or research test beds are not always designed to efficiently leverage the benefits of DC. This work addresses a pressing need for a study into the development of efficient DC loads. In particular, it focuses on documenting and demonstrating how to best leverage a DC input to eliminate or improve conversion stages in a load's power converter. This work identifies how typical building loads can benefit from DC input, including bath fans, refrigerators, wall adapters, task lights, and zone lighting. It then details the development of several prototypes that demonstrate efficiency savings with DC. The most efficient direct-DC loads are explicitly designed for DC from the ground up, rather than from an AC modification.","Elsevier","","Lawrence Berkeley National Lab.

Automatic and optimal placement of communication resources within the advanced metering infrastructure is critical to provide a high-performing, reliable, and resilient power system. Three network design formulations based on mixed-integer linear and non-linear programming approaches are proposed to minimise network congestion by optimising residual buffer capacity through the placement of data concentrators and network routeing. Results on a case study show that the proposed models improve network connectivity and robustness, and increase average residual buffer capacity. Maximising average residual capacity alone, however, results in both oversaturated and underutilised nodes, while maximising either minimum residual capacity or total reciprocal residual capacity can yield much-improved network load allocation. Consideration of connection redundancy improves network reliability further by ensuring quality-of-service in the event of an outage. Analysis of multi-period network expansion shows that the models do not deviate significantly from optimal when used progressively (within 5% deviation), and are effective for utility planners to use for smart grid expansion.","Institution of Engineering and Technology (IET)","","National Renewable Energy Lab.

In the first layer, the Granger causality is utilized to compare the causal relations from measurements across different locations to decide if an event is propagated from the transmission side. In the second layer, a trained sparse coding dictionary is utilized to unmix the physical causes of a frequency event. In the third layer, a moving z-score based event-pair detector is applied to identify if a frequency event is algorithm-induced.

This study proposes a capability-coordinated frequency control (CCFC) scheme of a virtual power plant (VPP) including adjustable-speed pumped storage hydropower (AS-PSH), a wind power plant (WPP), and an energy storage system to support the frequency nadir and reduce the steady-state error of system frequency. The CCFC scheme is based on a hierarchical-control structure in which a CCFC organises the output of local frequency control units. To support the frequency nadir, the CCFC dispatches weighted frequency errors that are proportional to the available headroom of the units; thus, the errors are forwarded separately with a system frequency error to the primary control loop of each unit and thereby arrest the frequency nadir at a higher value than a system without the CCFC. To reduce the steady-state error of the system frequency, the CCFC determines a partial active power command by additionally feeding an integrator of the CCFC with a modified frequency error that depends on the unit with the largest control.","","","National Renewable Energy Lab.

One can produce electricity from mechanical, chemical, thermal, electromagnetic (light), or another physical flux, or from a change of temperature, chemical composition, or a physical field: gravitational, magnetic, electric, mechanical stress and strain, etc. Flux examples are mechanical motions of air and water, surface waves and tides, heat fluxes due to a temperature gradient, solar light, and a chemical flux (such as humidity propagation in the atmospheric air or diffusion of salt in water due to a gradient of salinity at the mouth of a fresh-water river flowing into an ocean). Environmental changes are under-used in energy production, although people are exposed to daily and seasonal changes of the environment, which include changing air temperature, pressure, humidity, and composition, tidal changes of the gravitational field, and less periodic changes of the geo-magnetic and electric fields.

Zonal inertia constraints are formulated in unit commitment and optimal power flow to limit the rate of change of frequency (RoCoF) in the event of network separation. Load frequency relief is also considered to reduce the ramp rate requirement of primary reserve.

The effective distribution service restoration (DSR) is an important measure for a resilient distribution grid. In this work, the authors demonstrate that DSR can be significantly improved by leveraging the flexibility provided by the inclusion of demand response (DR). The authors propose a framework for this by considering integrated control of household-level flexible appliances to vary the load demand at the distribution-grid level to improve DSR. The overall framework of the proposed system is modelled as a three-step method considering three optimization problems to (i) calculate feasible controllable aggregated load range for each bus, (ii) determine candidate buses to perform DR and their target load demand, and (iii) maintain the load level in each house through home energy management during the DSR, considering uncertainties in load and solar generation sequentially. The optimization problems are formulated as linear programming, mixed-integer linear programming, and multistage stochastic programming (solved using the stochastic dual dynamic programming) models. Finally, case studies performed in the IEEE 123-node test feeder show improvements in resilience in terms of energy restored compared to the restoration process without DR.","Institution of Engineering and Technology","","Argonne National Lab.

In traditional approaches, the local GHI can be measured with very expensive instruments, and the large-area GHI collection depends on complex satellite-based models, solargis algorithms, and the high-performance computers (HPC). In this paper, a novel approach is proposed to capture the GHI conveniently and accurately. Considering the nonstationary property of the GHI on cloudy days, the GHI capturing is cast as an image regression problem. In traditional approaches, the image regression problem is treated as two parts, feature extraction (for the images) and regression model (for the regression targets), which are optimized separately and blocked the interconnections. Considering the nonlinear regression capability, a convolutional neural network (CNN) based image regression approach is proposed to provide an End-to-End solution for the cloudy day GHI capturing problem in this paper. The multilayer CNN is based on the AlexNet and VGG. The L2 (least square errors) with regularization is used as the loss function in the regression layer. For data cleaning, the Gaussian mixture model with Bayesian inference is employed to detect and eliminate the anomaly data in a nonparametric manner. The purified data are used as input data for the proposed image regression approach.

DERs may cause the systems' protection and control equipment to operate outside their intended parameters, due to DERs' variability and dispatchability. As this penetration grows, hosting capacity studies as well as protection and control impact mitigation become critical components to advance this penetration. In order to conduct such studies accurately, the electric power system's distribution components should be modeled correctly, and will require realistic time series loads at varying temporal and spatial conditions. The load component consists of the built environment and its load profiles. However, large-scale building load profiles are scarce, expensive, and hard to obtain. This article proposes a framework to fill this gap by developing detailed and scalable synthesized building load profile data sets. Specifically, a framework to extract load variability characteristics from a subset of buildings' empirical load profiles is presented. Thirty-four discrete wavelet transform functions with three levels of decomposition are used to extract a taxonomy of load variability profiles. The profiles are then applied to modeled building load profiles, developed using the energy simulation program EnergyPlus ® , to generate synthetic load profiles. The synthesized load profiles are variations of realistic representations of measured load profiles, containing load variabilities observed in actual buildings served by the electric power system. The paper focuses on the framework development with emphasis on variability extraction and application to develop 750 synthesized load profiles at a 15-minute time resolution.","Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers","","National Renewable Energy Lab.

Such data sets have important applications, such as in the study of the wide-area interactions of distributed energy resources, in the validation of advanced control schemes, and in network resilience to severe events. The data sets created here are geographically located on an actual North American footprint, with the end-user load information estimated from land parcel data. The grid created to serve these fictional but realistic loads is built starting with low-voltage and medium-voltage distribution systems in full detail, connected to distribution and transmission substations. Bulk generation is added, and a high-voltage transmission grid is created. This paper explains the overall process and challenges addressed in making the combined case. An example test case, syn-austin-TDgrid-v03, is shown for a 307236-customer case located in central Texas, with 140 substations, 448 feeders, and electric line data at voltages ranging from 120 V to 230 kV. Such new combined test cases help to promote high quality in the research on large-scale systems, particularly since much actual power system data are subject to data confidentiality. The highly detailed, combined T&D data set can also facilitate the modeling and analysis of coupled infrastructures.","Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers","","National Renewable Energy Lab.

The complexity of controlling the electric distribution system increases when distributed intermittent energy sources, such as solar photovoltaics (PVs), displace large-scale dispatchable generation [2]-[10]. Furthermore, if the supply from distributed resources exceeds the time-varying demand across a feeder, then the feeder-level voltage will increase. In extreme cases, large voltage increases will trigger the disconnection of distributed generation to protect electrical equipment and ensure customer safety. Consequently, coordinating renewable energy sources that are distributed throughout the distribution system-to match real-time demand across an entire power network-brings the additional challenge of maintaining a high level of supply reliability.","IEEE","","Univ. of California, Berkeley, CA (United States)","USDOE Office of Energy Efficiency and Renewable Energy (EERE)","","United States","2019-07-16T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: IEEE Control Systems Magazine; Journal Volume: 39; Journal Issue: 4","","Medium: ED; Size: p. 56-74","","","EE0008008","Journal ID: ISSN 1066-033X","10.1109/MCS.2019.2913611","","2022-11-16T00:00:00Z","1812938","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/1812938","https://www.osti.gov/servlets/purl/1812938","IEEE Control Systems Magazine","4","39"

"Using Computational Fluid Dynamics of Wind Simulations Coupled With Weather Data to Calculate Dynamic Line Ratings","Abboud, Alexander W.; Gentle, Jake P.; McJunkin, Timothy R.; Lehmer, Jacob P.","24 POWER TRANSMISSION AND DISTRIBUTION; dynamic line rating; general line ampacity state solver; computational fluid dynamics; overhead transmission lines","Dynamic line rating is a technology that allows for the rating of electrical conductors to be calculated based on local weather conditions rather than using ”worst-case” assumptions of weather conditions. The static ratings are typically based on weather conditions that are conservative in nature, and thus dynamic line rating may provide room to increase the current capacity. The local weather conditions may estimate conditions more accurately near the transmission lines accounting for terrain such as nearby hills. One way to estimate the local weather conditions is through the use of computational fluid dynamics. The results of a wind field simulation can be coupled with sparsely located weather stations to provide an accurate assessment of the wind speeds along the path of the conductor. Here, the wind field simulations are calculated using a steady state Reynolds-averaged Navier-Stokes model. These results along with local solar radiance measurements can be used to provide estimates of the steady state ampacity with the standard IEEE equations. An advanced test case for this process involves performing these simulations in a complex terrain, Hells Canyon, the deepest river gorge in North America. The results show that by using weather-based sensors without considering localized wind conditions, the available ampacity may be over-predicted significantly.","IEEE","","Idaho National Lab.

We prove fundamental limits for unsupervised estimation of electrical networks, establishing effective impedance between active nodes as the core, generally-attainable network information. Here, we propose a noise-robust technique for estimating effective impedances via the reduced Laplacian form of the Kron reduced admittance matrix, termed the “subKron” form. We present the Complex Recursive Grouping algorithm to reconstruct radial networks from effective impedances. Simulation results on noisy data demonstrate the efficacy of the proposed methods for small networks, and the challenges of applying them to large networks.

"Automated electrical demand peak leveling in a manufacturing facility with short term energy storage for smart grid participation","Machalek, Derek; Powell, Kody","24 POWER TRANSMISSION AND DISTRIBUTION; Peak leveling; Load leveling; Chiller; Short term energy storage; Untapped storage; Thermal energy storage","Demand side management of energy is a vital function in the smart grid that allows for greater integration of renewable energy resources, and is facilitated with economic incentives in energy and demand pricing schedules. Manufacturing systems can take advantage of these incentives to reduce their energy costs through active energy management. This paper is a simulation analysis on the implementation of a novel algorithm that levelizes the maximum power load of an industrial bakery that operates under an on-peak demand price structure. The algorithm takes advantage of an untapped thermal energy storage resource in the facility, a chilled glycol buffer tank, to level the short intra-day power oscillations that the facility experiences. One of the key advantages of the algorithm is that it does not require precise demand forecasting or complex control algorithms, such as model predictive control. Even with substantial error in peak power estimates (5%), the algorithm is expected to result in at least a 2% peak reduction. Under ideal prediction, the algorithm reduces the on-peak facility power maximum by 7.3% of the possible 9.0% reduction the storage can provide. Further, the algorithm uses very few facility specific inputs, and can readily be adapted for any facility with short intra-day oscillatory power profiles and untapped storage capacity. The key insight of the paper is the employment of a novel algorithm to leverage untapped energy storage in manufacturing facilities to transform them into smart grid participants with no major capital investment.","Elsevier - Society of Manufacturing Engineers","","Univ. of Utah, Salt Lake City, UT (United States)","USDOE Office of Energy Efficiency and Renewable Energy (EERE)","","United States","2019-06-20T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: Journal of Manufacturing Systems; Journal Volume: 52","","Medium: ED; Size: p. 100-109","","","EE0007712","Journal ID: ISSN 0278-6125","10.1016/j.jmsy.2019.06.001","","2022-07-15T00:00:00Z","1867011","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/1867011","https://www.osti.gov/servlets/purl/1867011","Journal of Manufacturing Systems","","52"
"Hierarchical Scheduling of Aggregated TCL Flexibility for Transactive Energy in Power Systems","Song, Meng; Sun, Wei; Wang, Yifei; Shahidehpour, Mohammad; Li, Zhiyi; Gao, Ciwei","25 ENERGY STORAGE; 24 POWER TRANSMISSION AND DISTRIBUTION; Transactive energy; thermostatically controlled loads; flexibility; electricity markets","This paper investigates a hierarchical approach to the optimal scheduling of flexibility offered as transactive energy by thermostatically controlled loads (TCLs). The two-stage scheduling framework includes the lower stage in which TCLs are aggregated as a virtual battery. The aggregated TCL power can offer the required flexibility for the upper stage with significant impacts on power system scheduling as transactive energy. Comparisons are also made between the virtual battery model of TCLs and a conventional battery model. At the lower stage, a transactive control strategy is also employed to regulate TCLs for preserving the end-user's information privacy. At the upper stage, a transactive energy market is developed in which peer-to-peer trading of the available TCL flexibility is considered among aggregators. Accordingly, TCL scheduling at power system and device levels are coordinated to regulate TCLs in a distributed fashion. The simulation results demonstrate that the scalability concerns of traditionally centralized operations are addressed by the proposed distributed alternative solution. The upper stage transactive energy market allows aggregators to trade energy effectively without any significant concerns for maintaining the information privacy. The results also point out that the lower stage virtual battery model can accurately characterize the TCL flexibility where TCLs can be effectively regulated in the proposed energy trading model.","IEEE","","Univ. of Central Florida, Orlando, FL (United States)","USDOE","","United States","2019-11-26T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: IEEE Transactions on Smart Grid; Journal Volume: 11; Journal Issue: 3","","Medium: ED; Size: p. 2452-2463","","","EE0007998","Journal ID: ISSN 1949-3053; 2242019R20032","10.1109/tsg.2019.2955852","","2021-09-22T00:00:00Z","1820627","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/1820627","https://www.osti.gov/servlets/purl/1820627","IEEE Transactions on Smart Grid","3","11"

Of particular focus are batteries with 4-h duration due to rules in several regions along with these batteries' potential to achieve life-cycle cost parity with combustion turbines compared to longer-duration batteries. However, whether 4-h energy storage can provide peak capacity depends largely on the shape of electricity demand. Under historical grid conditions, beyond about 28 GW nationally the ability of 4-h batteries to provide peak capacity begins to fall. We find that the addition of renewable generation can significantly increase storage's potential by changing the shape of net demand patterns; for example, beyond about 10% penetration of solar photovoltaics, the national practical potential for 4-h storage to provide peak capacity doubles. Furthermore, the impact of wind generation is less clear and likely requires more detailed study considering the exchange of wind power across multiple regions.","Elsevier","","National Renewable Energy Lab.

The underlying correlation emerges from solar irradiance that is responsible in part for both the variability in solar PV power and temperature. The proposed model can be used to capture the uncertainty in solar PV power and its correlation with the electric power consumption of thermostatically controlled loads. First, a model for solar PV power that explicitly incorporates the stochasticity due to clouds via a regime-switching process between the three classes of sunny , overcast and partly cloudy is proposed. Then, the relationship between temperature and solar power is postulated using a second-order Volterra model. This joint modeling is leveraged to develop a joint probabilistic forecasting method for solar PV power and temperature. Real-world datasets that include solar PV power and temperature measurements in California are analyzed and the effectiveness of the joint model in providing probabilistic forecasts is verified. The proposed forecasting methodology outperforms several reference methods thus portraying that the underlying correlation between temperature and solar PV power is well defined and only requires a simple lower-complexity sampling space.","","","National Renewable Energy Lab.

Yet, typical electricity capacity expansion planning does not consider climate-water constraints. We project four alternative U.S. power system configurations using an iterative modeling and data exchange platform that integrates climate-driven hydrological, thermal power plant, and capacity expansion models. Through a comparison with traditional modeling approaches, we show that this novel approach provides greater confidence in electricity capacity projections by incorporating feasibility checks that adjust infrastructure development to reach grid reliability thresholds under climate-water constraints. Initial projections without climate-water impacts on electricity generation show future power systems become less vulnerable, independent of climate-water adaptation, as economic drivers increase renewable and natural gas-based capacity, while water-intensive coal and nuclear plants retire. However, power systems may face reliability challenges without climate-water adaptation, revealing the significance of incorporating climate-water impacts into power system planning. Climate-adjusted (Iterative approach) projections require a 5.3-12.0% increase in national-level capacity, relative to Initial projections, leading to an additional $125-143 billion (5.0-7.0%) in infrastructure costs. Variable renewable and natural gas technologies account for nearly all the additional capacity and, together with regional trade-offs in electricity generation, enhance grid performance to reach reliability thresholds. These adaptation transitions also lower water use and emissions, contributing to climate change mitigation, and highlight the trade-offs and impacts of both near and long-term electricity generation planning decisions.","American Chemical Society (ACS)","","National Renewable Energy Lab.

The presence of distributed energy resources (DERs) requires directional protection due to the added potential for energy to flow in both directions down the line. Additionally, contingency requirements for critical loads within a microgrid may result in looped or meshed systems. Computation speeds of iterative methods required to coordinate loops are improved by starting with a minimum breakpoint set (MBPS) of relays. A breakpoint set (BPS) is a set of breakers such that, when opened, breaks all loops in a mesh grid creating a radial system. A MBPS is a BPS that consists of the minimum possible number of relays required to accomplish this goal. In this paper, a method is proposed in which a minimum spanning tree is computed to indirectly break all loops in the system, and a set difference is used to identify the MBPS. The proposed method is found to minimize the cardinality of the BPS to achieve a MBPS.</p>","MDPI","","Sandia National Lab.

Small-signal modeling using the proposed graphs is demonstrated for two commonly used single-phase PLL structures: SOGI-PLL and Park-PLL. Loop-gain models are developed for these PLLs to evaluate how an orthogonal signal generator (OSG), which is required in single-phase PLLs using the synchronous reference frame (SRF) architecture, modifies the PLL loop-gain compared to that of a three-phase SRF-PLL, which does not require an OSG. It is shown that the OSG in the SOGI-PLL and Park-PLL introduces significant phase-lag in the PLL loop-gain, limiting the maximum bandwidth for which either PLL can be designed. Slow frequency adaptation (SFA) of OSG is proposed as a solution to mitigate the influence of the OSG dynamics on the PLL loop-gain.

"Co-optimized trading of hybrid wind power plant with retired EV batteries in energy and reserve markets under uncertainties","Zhan, Sen; Hou, Peng; Enevoldsen, Peter; Yang, Guangya; Zhu, Jiangsheng; Eichman, Joshua D.; Jacobson, Mark Z.","17 WIND ENERGY; 24 POWER TRANSMISSION AND DISTRIBUTION; retired EV battery-storage system (RESS); FCR-N market; spot market; MILP","To be competitive in the electricity markets, various technologies have been reported to increase profits of wind farm owners. Combining battery storage system, wind farms can be operated as conventional power plants which promotes the integration of wind power into the power grid. However, high expenses on batteries keep investors away. Retired EV batteries, fortunately, still have enough capacity to be reused and could be obtained at a low price. In this work, a two-stage optimization of a wind energy retired EV battery-storage system is proposed. The economic performance of the proposed system is examined concerning its participation in the frequency containment normal operation reserve (FCR-N) market and the spot market simultaneously. To account uncertainties in the wind farm output, various electricity market prices, and up/down regulation status, a scenario-based stochastic programming method is used. The sizing of the equipment is optimized on top of daily operations of the hybrid system which formulates a mixed-integer linear programming (MILP) problem. Scenarios are generated with the Monte Carlo simulation (MCS) and Roulette Wheel Mechanism (RWM), which are further reduced with the simultaneous backward method (SBM) to increase computational efficiency. A 21 MW wind farm is selected as a case study. Here, the optimization results show that by integrating with a retired EV battery-storage system (RESS) and a bi-directional inverter, the wind farm can increase its profits significantly when forwarding bids in both of the aforementioned electricity markets.","Elsevier","","National Renewable Energy Lab.

The first stage economic dispatch determines the optimal operating points of charging stations and battery swapping stations (BSS) for EVs under plug-in and battery swapping modes, respectively. The proposed stochastic model predictive control (SMPC) problem in this stage is characterized through a chance-constrained optimization formulation that can effectively capture the system and the forecast uncertainties. A distributed algorithm, the alternating direction method of multipliers (ADMM), is applied to accelerate the optimization computation through parallel computing. The second stage is aimed in coordinating the EV charging mechanisms to continuously follow the first-stage solutions, i.e., the target operating points, and meeting the EV customers' charging demands captured via the Advanced Metering Infrastructure (AMI). In this work, the proposed solution offers a holistic control strategy for large-scale centralized power grids in which the aggregated individual parameters are predictable and the system dynamics do not vary sharply within a short time-interval.","IEEE","","Argonne National Lab.

Nathan","42 ENGINEERING; 24 POWER TRANSMISSION AND DISTRIBUTION","Networked power grid systems are susceptible to a phenomenon known as Coherent Swing Instability (CSI), in which a subset of machines in the grid lose synchrony with the rest of the network. We develop network level evaluation metrics to (i) identify community substructures in the power grid network, (ii) determine weak points in the network that are particularly sensitive to CSI, and (iii) produce an engineering approach for the addition of transmission lines to reduce the incidences of CSI in existing networks, or design new power grid networks that are robust to CSI by their network design. For simulations on a reduced model for the American Northeast power grid, where a block of buses representing the New England region exhibit a strong propensity for CSI, we show that modifying the network’s connectivity structure can markedly improve the grid’s resilience to CSI. Our analysis provides a versatile diagnostic tool for evaluating the efficacy of adding lines to a power grid which is known to be prone to CSI. This is a particularly relevant problem in large-scale power systems, where improving stability and robustness to interruptions by increasing overall network connectivity is not feasible due to financial and infrastructural constraints.","Springer Science + Business Media","","Pacific Northwest National Lab.

The key concept is a consensus weighting protocol (CWP) for agents to reach an agreement. Unlike the well adopted average-consensus protocol (ACP), the proposed CWP enables each agent to converge to its weighted portion of the sum of all initial values. Thus, the proposed CWP is more suitable for the UFLS application, as it allows load buses with a higher level of loading to shed more, rather than reducing by the same average value over all load buses as required by the ACP. Proof of convergence for the proposed CWP is derived and presented in this paper, together with the constraints. For implementation of the multi-agent system (MAS), the monitoring, estimation, and distribution steps are developed. Two study cases and the simulation results are provided to validate the performance of the proposed agent-based UFLS scheme.","Elsevier","","Vanderbilt Univ., Nashville, TN (United States)","USDOE Advanced Research Projects Agency - Energy (ARPA-E); National Science Foundation (NSF)","","United States","2019-11-05T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: International Journal of Electrical Power and Energy Systems; Journal Volume: 117; Journal Issue: C","","Medium: ED; Size: Article No. 105615","","DOE-VANDERBILT-0000666-32","AR0000666; AC05-76RL01830; 1441214","Journal ID: ISSN 0142-0615","10.1016/j.ijepes.2019.105615","","2020-11-05T00:00:00Z","1616413","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/1616413","https://www.osti.gov/servlets/purl/1616413","International Journal of Electrical Power and Energy Systems","C","117"

A coordinated data attack by sophisticated adversaries can render existing data corrupt or outlier detection methods ineffective. This would have a very negative impact on operational decisions. The focus of this paper is to develop descriptive analytics-based methods for anomaly detection to protect the load forecasting process against cyberattacks to essential data. We propose an integrated solution (IS) and a hybrid implementation of IS (HIIS) that can detect and mitigate cyberattack induced long sequence anomalies. HIIS is also capable of improving true positive rates and reducing false positive rates significantly comparing with IS.

The paper aims to: discuss the various simulation methods for power system analysis; highlight the need for modeling unbalanced distribution system for accurate load margin assessment; demonstrate the influence of net-load unbalance (NLU) on voltage stability margin (VSM). We also share a T&D co-simulation interface with commercial power system solvers. The distribution system is evolving rapidly with high proliferation of distributed energy resources (DERs); these are not guaranteed to proliferate in a balanced manner and uncertainty resulting due to these DERs is well acknowledged. These uncertainties cannot be captured or visualized without representing the distribution system in detail along with the transmission system. We show the impact of proliferation of DERs in various 3-phase proportions on voltage stability margin through T&D co-simulation. We also study the impact of volt/VAR control on voltage stability margin. This analysis is only possible by representing the distribution system in detail through T&D co-simulation. In conclusion, higher percentage of net-load unbalance (NLU) in distribution system aggravates the voltage stability margin of the distribution system, which can further negatively influence the overall voltage stability margin of the system.","IEEE","","Iowa State Univ., Ames, IA (United States)","USDOE Office of Electricity (OE)","","United States","2019-10-28T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: IEEE Transactions on Power Systems; Journal Volume: 35; Journal Issue: 3","","Medium: ED; Size: p. 2072-2081","","","OE0000876","Journal ID: ISSN 0885-8950","10.1109/tpwrs.2019.2950132","","2020-11-04T00:00:00Z","1692378","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/1692378","https://www.osti.gov/servlets/purl/1692378","IEEE Transactions on Power Systems","3","35"

Without a comprehensive understanding of thermal plant operation, we may over- or underestimate our ability to integrate variable generation resources and thus draw incomplete or inaccurate conclusions regarding their potential economic and environmental effects. The only public data source for understanding many elements of the operational characteristics of the thermal fleet is the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency Clean Air Markets database of historical power plant operation. However, though these data sets have been widely utilized, their use has proven to be difficult, and methods to clean and filter the data are not transparent. Here, we describe the database and a method to clean and filter it. We then use the cleaned database to demonstrate several characteristics of historical plant operation, including frequent part load operation. Finally, we provide a cleaned data set with heat rate curves and describe how to use it in general modeling activities and analysis.","American Chemical Society (ACS)","","National Renewable Energy Lab.

A key question is what is sector coupling, and how does it impact the flexibility of the energy system? Here, the energy system includes several sectors - electricity, gas, heat, and transportation - that have been independent for decades in most countries except for their coupling via combined heat and power (CHP) units. In energy systems integration, some sectors may provide flexibility to other sectors, while other sectors will require flexibility when interlinking. To support these synergies among sectors, it is important to explore and quantify mutual interactions as well as seek examples of how these integrations can provide flexibility and other benefits. From the perspective of the electricity sector, it is important to ensure that there is enough flexibility in the interconnected systems to support decarbonization goals, such as those set in the Paris Agreement, while ensuring operational reliability.","","","National Renewable Energy Lab.

The method was applied to nine major outage events, including hurricanes and windstorms. In one event, Hurricane Irma, a network of about 1000 thermostats provided quantitatively similar results to detailed utility data with respect to the number of homes without power and identification of the most severely affected regions. The method generated regionally uniform outage data that would give emergency authorities additional visibility into the scope and magnitude of outages.

We report a novel one-step fabrication method of incorporating carbon in aluminum alloys by the application of a high electric current to molten Al metal containing particles of activated carbon at high temperature and under Ar atmosphere. We propose that the mechanism for carbon incorporation is similar to electromigration where the current facilitates ionization of the carbon atoms followed by polymerization of the carbon structures and the formation of graphitic chains and ribbons along preferred directions of the Al lattice. Furthermore, the current induces transformation from amorphous carbon to crystalline graphitic structures that propagate in the metal matrix. The carbon is identified by the C-K edge in electron energy loss spectra, X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy, Raman and Kelvin probe force microscopy. The stiffness is increased in these samples; hardness, on the other hand, decreases for some samples compared to reference Al alloys with no carbon. Here, the electrical conductivity is superior to that of Al-carbon nanotube composites previously reported. The enhanced properties of Al covetics show potential for naval and aerospace applications and power transmission lines.","Elsevier","","Univ. of Maryland, College Park, MD (United States)","USDOE; ONR","","United States","2019-04-15T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: Carbon; Journal Volume: 149","","Medium: ED; Size: p. 203-212","","","EE0008313","Journal ID: ISSN 0008-6223; 6F-30062; N000141410042; 1120-1120-99","10.1016/j.carbon.2019.04.049","","2022-06-09T00:00:00Z","1870688","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/1870688","https://www.osti.gov/servlets/purl/1870688","Carbon","","149"

Each load in the ensemble is assumed to be equipped with a random number generator switching heating/cooling on or off with a Poisson rate, <italic>r</italic> , when the load leaves the comfort zone. Ensemble diversity is modeled through inhomogeneity/disorder in the deterministic dynamics of loads. Approached from the standpoint of statistical physics, the ensemble represents a non-equilibrium system driven away from its natural steady state by the DR. The ability of the ensemble to recover by mixing faster to the steady state after its DR’s use is advantageous. The trade-off between the level of the aggregator’s control, commanding the devices to lower the rate <italic>r</italic> , and the phase-space-oscillatory deterministic dynamics is analyzed. Then, we study the effect of the load diversity, investigating four different disorder probability distributions (DPDs) ranging from the case of the Gaussian DPD to the case of the uniform with finite support DPD. We show that stronger regularity of the DPD results in faster mixing, which is similar to the Landau damping in plasma physics. Our theoretical analysis is supported by extensive numerical validation. </p>","Nature Publishing Group","","Los Alamos National Lab.

To help gauge these challenges to the power system, we quantify IAV of wind and solar resource and electricity generation across the Electric Reliability Council of Texas (ERCOT) power system, then assess the IAV of wind and solar electricity generation during peak-load hours (i.e., IAV of wind and solar capacity values) for the current ERCOT wind and solar generator fleet. To do so, we leverage the long timespan of four reanalysis datasets with the high resolution of grid integration datasets. We find the IAV (quantified as the coefficient of variation) of wind generation ranges from 2.3%-11% across ERCOT, while the IAV of solar generation ranges from 1.7%-5% across ERCOT. We also find significant seasonal and regional variability in the IAV of wind and solar generation, highlighting the importance of considering multiple temporal and spatial scales when planning and operating the power system. In addition, the IAV of the current wind and solar fleets' capacity values (defined as generation during peak load hours) are larger than the IAV of the same fleets' capacity factors. IAV of annual generation and capacity values of wind and solar could impact operations and planning in several ways, e.g. through annual emissions, meeting emission reduction targets, and investment needs to maintain capacity adequacy.","IOP Publishing","","National Renewable Energy Lab.

This paper presents a new hybrid converter to address this need. The converter uses two interleaved inductors for complete soft charging of flying capacitors to efficiently provide high output currents with no capacitor hard-charge loss. This dual inductor hybrid (DIH) converter features a smaller number of switches and more effective switch utilization than a recently reported Hybrid Dickson converter, yielding substantially less switch losses represented by smaller volt-ampere products and smaller equivalent output resistance. Converter operation principle is analyzed in detail to confirm the feasibility and benefits, and design considerations are provided to identify a practical design process.

"Data-Driven Distribution System Load Modeling for Quasi-Static Time-Series Simulation","Zhu, Xiangqi; Mather, Barry","24 POWER TRANSMISSION AND DISTRIBUTION; load modeling; distribution system; diversity; quasi-static time series; QSTS; variability","This paper presents a data-driven distribution system load modeling methodology targeting quasi-static time-series (QSTS) simulation. The proposed methodology is appropriate for modeling down to the level of the customer transformer, and it has three main features: 1) both load pattern diversity and intra-second load variability are considered, 2) the load profiles can be populated for multiple nodes on a circuit in such a way that the diversity factor of the feeder can be defined and tuned, and 3) the load aggregation method can be used to populate the profiles for different nodes at various load aggregation levels. Furthermore, as the foundation of the modeling methodology, variability and diversity libraries have been established based on high-resolution load data collected on customer transformers from real utility feeders. The proposed modeling methodology has been used to build load data sets for both the IEEE 123-bus feeder model and a realistic utility feeder model. The QSTS simulation results on the two evaluation feeders have demonstrated that the load data sets established from the proposed modeling methodology can effectively capture the load impact on feeder operations. For the realistic utility feeder, the effectiveness of the proposed methodology has also been validated by comparing the voltage characteristics of the feeder with modeled loads and the voltage characteristics of realistic voltage data from the same feeder.","IEEE","","National Renewable Energy Lab.

"Monitoring Long Term Voltage Instability due to Distribution & Transmission Interaction using Unbalanced μPMU & PMU Measurements","Matavalam, Amarsagar Reddy Ramapuram; Singhal, Ankit; Ajjarapu, Venkataramana","24 POWER TRANSMISSION AND DISTRIBUTION; Long Term Voltage Stability, Thevenin Equivalent, Phasor Measurement Unit, Voltage Stability Index","This research extends the idea of the Thevenin equivalent into unbalanced 3φ circuits and proposes a 3φ long-term voltage stability indicator (VSI), that can identify critical loads in a system. Furthermore, in order to identify whether the voltage stability limit is due to the transmission network or a distribution network, a transmission-distribution distinguishing index (TDDI) is proposed. The novelty in the proposed indices is that they can account for the unbalance in the lines and loads, enabling them to use unbalanced phasor measurements naturally. This is supported by mathematical derivations and numerical results. A convex optimization formulation to estimate the 3φ Thevenin equivalent using PMU & μPMU measurements is proposed, making it possible to calculate VSI and TDDI in an online model-free manner. Numerical simulations performed using co-simulation between Pypower and GridlabD are presented for the IEEE 9 bus and the 30 bus transmission networks combined with several modified IEEE 13 node and 37 node distribution networks. These case studies validate the proposed 3φ-VSI and TDDI over a wide range of scenarios and demonstrate the importance of μPMU measurements in identifying the regions causing long term voltage instability.","IEEE","","Iowa State Univ., Ames, IA (United States)","USDOE Office of Electricity (OE)","","United States","2019-05-21T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: IEEE Transactions on Smart Grid; Journal Volume: 11; Journal Issue: 1","","Medium: ED; Size: p. 873-883","","","OE0000876","Journal ID: ISSN 1949-3053","10.1109/TSG.2019.2917676","","2022-05-27T00:00:00Z","1572408","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/1572408","https://www.osti.gov/servlets/purl/1572408","IEEE Transactions on Smart Grid","1","11"
"A method to identify weak points of interconnection of renewable energy resources","Wu, Di; Aldaoudeyeh, Al Motasem; Javadi, Milad; Ma, Feng; Tan, Jin; Jiang, John N.","24 POWER TRANSMISSION AND DISTRIBUTION; renewable energy resources; grid reliability; weakness analysis; grid strength; short circuit ratio","The increasing penetration of renewable energy resources (RERs) is challenging power grid planning and operation in maintaining grid reliability. Potential power grid reliability and stability issues may arise when large-scale RERs are connected to a weak power grid. These issues may become more significant due to the mutual interactions among RERs that are interconnected electrically close through a power network. Weakness analysis based on grid strength assessment is useful for identifying the potential weak grid issues. However, when taking into account the impact of the interactions among RERs, the weakness analysis becomes computationally challenging. Different combinations of points of interconnections (POIs) of RERs may have different impacts on grid strength at each POI. Due to the combination nature, such weakness analysis may be time-consuming when identifying the weakest combination of POIs from a large number of potential candidates in realistic power grids. To address this concern, the impact of the power network structure on grid strength is analyzed in this paper. It is found that the impact mainly depends on the impedance ratios at POIs. The findings can be summarized as two criteria to develop a recursive method for fast identification of the weakest combination in this paper. The efficacy of the proposed method is demonstrated through case studies on the IEEE 39-bus system and a realistic power grid.","Elsevier","","National Renewable Energy Lab.

Individual agents make sensor measurements of an unknown parameter belonging to a compact set, and, at every time step, a fraction of the agents’ sensor measurements may fall under attack and take arbitrary values. We present the Saturated Innovation Update (SIU) algorithm for distributed estimation resilient to sensor attacks. Under the iterative SIU algorithm, if less than one half of the agent sensors fall under attack, then, all of the agents’ estimates converge at a polynomial rate (with respect to the number of iterations) to the true parameter. The resilience of SIU to sensor attacks does not depend on the topology of the inter-agent communication network, as long as it remains connected. We demonstrate the performance of SIU with numerical examples.","IEEE","","Carnegie Mellon Univ., Pittsburgh, PA (United States)","USDOE Office of Energy Efficiency and Renewable Energy (EERE); USDOE Office of Electricity (OE); Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency (DARPA)","","United States","2019-09-01T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: IEEE Transactions on Automatic Control; Journal Volume: 64; Journal Issue: 9","","Medium: ED; Size: p. 3772-3779","","","EE0007165; OE0000779; FA8750-12-2-0291; HR00111320007","Journal ID: ISSN 0018-9286","10.1109/tac.2018.2882168","","2020-12-02T00:00:00Z","1724568","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/1724568","https://www.osti.gov/servlets/purl/1724568","IEEE Transactions on Automatic Control","9","64"

Improving the accuracy of PV generation estimation is beneficial for both the PV owners and the grid operators. Recently, deep learning algorithms possible by the availability of data have shown its advantages for time series estimation; however, its application on PV generation estimation is still in the early stage. In this paper, a hybrid estimation model with a combination of long-short-term-memory network (LSTM) and persistence model (PM) is developed to provide day-ahead PV estimation at 15-minute time interval with high accuracy and robustness.

"Providing reliable and financially sustainable electricity access in India using super-efficient appliances","Phadke, Amol; Park, Won Young; Abhyankar, Nikit","24 POWER TRANSMISSION AND DISTRIBUTION; Electricity access; Electricity service; Energy efficiency; Storage; Procurement; India","In India, 46 million, mostly rural, households lack access to electricity – over 50% of those are in the states of Bihar and Uttar Pradesh. While India has set an aggressive goal of extending the grid to all households by 2019, grid extension does not necessarily imply reliable electricity access. Indian utilities face a financial disincentive to supplying reliable electricity in rural areas because of subsidized tariffs and low consumer willingness-to-pay. Tariff subsidies for full household electrification in these states would be about Rs 15,000 Cr per year, which is two-times the existing subsidies and equivalent to 20–30% of their annual utility revenues. We find that super-efficient lamps, TVs, and fans can reduce the energy consumption of a rural household by over 70% cost-effectively, resulting in a net reduction in the total subsidy burden. Reduced consumption offers an opportunity to raise consumer tariffs while ensuring consumers’ monthly electricity bills reduced. We also argue that super-efficient appliances make consumer-side storage cost-effective, leading to greater consumer willingness-to-pay. We recommend adoption of super-efficient appliances as part of the electricity access initiative in India, and electricity service based tariff setting as the next policy steps towards providing a reliable and sustainable electricity access.","Elsevier","","Lawrence Berkeley National Lab.

"Including operational aspects in the planning of power systems with large amounts of variable generation: A review of modeling approaches","Helistö, Niina; Kiviluoma, Juha; Holttinen, Hannele; Lara, Jose Daniel; Hodge, Bri-Mathias","24 POWER TRANSMISSION AND DISTRIBUTION; power system; planning; operation; variable generation; modeling; optimization","In the past, power system planning was based on meeting the load duration curve at minimum cost. The increasing share of variable generation (VG) makes operational constraints more important in the planning problem, and there is more and more interest in considering aspects such as sufficient ramping capability, sufficient reserve procurement, power system stability, storage behavior, and the integration of other energy sectors often through demand response assets. In VG integration studies, several methods have been applied to combine the planning and operational timescales. We present a four-level categorization for the modeling methods, in order of increasing complexity: (1a) investment model only, (1b) operational model only, (2) unidirectionally soft-linked investment and operational models, (3a) bidirectionally soft-linked investment and operational models, (3b) operational model with an investment update algorithm, and (4) co-optimization of investments and operation. The review shows that using a low temporal resolution or only few representative days will not suffice in order to determine the optimal generation portfolio. In addition, considering operational effects proves to be important in order to get a more optimal generation portfolio and more realistic estimations of system costs. However, operational details appear to be less significant than the temporal representation. Furthermore, the benefits and impacts of more advanced modeling techniques on the resulting generation capacity mix significantly depend on the system properties. Thus, the choice of the model should depend on the purpose of the study as well as on system characteristics.","Wiley","","National Renewable Energy Lab.

However, there is typically little if any coordination between the district developers and the local utility. Most attention is paid to the district's annual net load and generation without considering their instantaneous imbalance or the connecting network's state. This presents an opportunity to learn lessons from the design of distribution feeders for districts characterized by low loads and high penetrations of DERs that can be applied to the distribution grid at large. The aim of this overview is to summarize current practices in sustainable district planning as well as advances in modeling and design tools for incorporating the power distribution system into the district planning process. Recent developments in the modeling and optimization of district power systems, including their coordination with multi-energy systems and the impact of high penetration levels of renewable energy, are introduced. Sustainable districts in England and Japan are reviewed as case studies to illustrate the extent to which distribution system planning has been considered in practice. Finally, newly developed building-to-grid modeling tools that can facilitate coordinated district and power system design with utility involvement are introduced, along with suggestions for future research directions.","Wiley","","National Renewable Energy Lab.

Dynamic MGs are commonly dominated by grid-forming inverters and nested in unbalanced distribution feeders. Unlike balanced systems where only positive-sequence components exist, proper operation of unbalanced dynamic MGs presents additional challenges. A distributed secondary control strategy is developed in this study for distributed generators (DGs) interfaced with gridforming inverters in unbalanced dynamic MGs by providing coordinated regulations on both positive- and negative-sequence system models. System frequency and voltage are under constant regulation, along with voltage unbalance (VU) management for multiple critical load buses (CLB). The proposed control strategy enables seamless system transition during unbalanced dynamic MGs reconfiguration, and guarantees proportional positive- and negative-sequence power sharing among connected DGs with respect to system topology variation. Detailed controller designs are provided and stability analyses are derived.

As power systems increasingly shift towards wind and solar power, these resource changes will increasingly impact power system operations. We assess how power system operations will be affected by climate change impacts on wind and solar resources by generating wind and solar generation profiles for a reference period and five climate change projections. We then run a unit commitment and economic dispatch model to dispatch a high-renewable generator fleet with these profiles. For climate change projections, we use 2041–2050 output from five global climate models (GCMs) for Representative Concentration Pathway 8.5 for Texas, our study system. All five GCMs indicate increased wind generation potential by 1%–4% under climate change in Texas, while three and two GCMs indicate increased and decreased solar generation potential, respectively, by up to 1%. Uneven generation potential changes across time result in greater changes in dispatched generation by fuel type. Notably, nuclear generation decreases across GCMs by up to 7%, largely in low-demand (winter) months when nuclear plants, which have a high minimum stable load, must reduce their generation to avoid overgeneration. Increased wind and/or solar generation result in reduced system CO<sub>2</sub> emissions and electricity production costs across four of the five GCMs by 8–16 million tons and $216–516 million, or by 2% and 1%, respectively. Future research should assess the atmospheric and climate dynamics that underlie such changes in power system operations.","IOP Publishing","","National Renewable Energy Lab.

From this analysis, a closed form expression approximating the recovery time is derived and the key load parameters impacting the behavior of voltage recovery are identified. A monitoring scheme based on the measured load admittance is then proposed to detect the onset of stalling, even in the presence of voltage oscillations, and estimate the duration of the delayed voltage recovery. A mitigation scheme utilizing smart thermostats and offline learning is also derived to ensure that the voltage recovers to the pre-contingency voltage within a specified time. Both the monitoring and mitigation schemes only need local measurements at a substation making them promising for online applications.

The modified metrics better support reliability planning in the US because they separately measure the effectiveness of actions to improve reliability made by the two distinct groups of firms (and their regulators or oversight bodies) that are responsible for planning and operating each portion of the US electric power system. The authors then present for the first time quantitative information on the reliability of each portion of the US electric power system. When reliability is measured using the system average interruption duration index and the system average interruption frequency index, they find that the distribution system accounts for at least 94 and 92%, respectively, of all interruptions.

Advanced distribution grids are considered to be functionally more sophisticated than traditional ones. The desirable advanced functionalities include – reconfiguration, real-time sensing, DERs, self-healing, etc. Some of these functionalities are currently being realized by microgrids as well. However, it is not feasible to convert each section of a distribution grid into a microgrid, but can be instituted with functionalities by design and controls at relatively lower costs. Interconnection of DERs, including energy storage to improve reliability and resilience is presented in details. Resilience of distribution grids is gaining greater importance and research towards enhancing it utilizing DERs is a key area. A real-time resilience framework with Analytical Hierarchical Processes (AHP) is developed that adapts to changing configurations, DERs, switching operations, grid conditions, etc. to provide an accurate and adoptable composite resilience metric. This framework and the composite resilience metric can play a unique role in operational and design decisions for operating future distribution grids. Advanced functionalities such as scenario-based reconfiguration in distribution grids are considered, with resilience metrics as performance criteria for choosing a preferred combination. Simulations are performed using Digital Real-Time Simulator (DRTS) and characterized response of flow battery validated against actual flow battery hardware is imposed to provide realistic results. Reconfiguration program is interfaced with DRTS for bi-directional real-time communication. Key contributions include enhancement of resilience of distribution grids using energy storage system under dynamic operating conditions.","Elsevier","","Idaho National Lab.

Internal temperature monitoring of operating power transformers can also be leveraged for asset monitoring applications targeting at fault detection enabling condition-based maintenance. Transformers present a variety of challenging sensing environments such as high levels of electromagnetic interference and limited space for conventional sensors to operate. Immersion of power transformers in insulation oils for thermal management during operation and the presence of relatively large and time-varying electrical and occasional magnetic fields make sensing technologies requiring electrical wires or active power at sensing locations highly undesirable. In this work, we investigate thermal response of a standard telecom fiber instrumented on compact transformer cores by using an optical frequency-domain reflectometry scheme. As a result, correlation between conventional temperature sensing methods and fiber-optic sensing results as well as tradeoffs between spatial resolution and temperature measurement accuracy is discussed and spatially resolved real-time monitoring of temperatures in energized transformers is experimentally demonstrated.","IEEE","","National Energy Technology Laboratory (NETL), Pittsburgh, PA, Morgantown, WV, and Albany, OR (United States)","USDOE Office of Fossil Energy (FE)","","United States","2019-04-23T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: IEEE Transactions on Power Delivery; Journal Volume: 34; Journal Issue: 4","","Medium: ED","","NA","","Journal ID: ISSN 0885-8977","10.1109/TPWRD.2019.2912866","","2021-10-27T00:00:00Z","1582381","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/1582381","https://www.osti.gov/servlets/purl/1582381","IEEE Transactions on Power Delivery","4","34"

The findings show that each grid-support function exposes the power system to distinct types and magnitudes of risk. The physical impact from cyber actions was analysed in cases of DER providing distribution system voltage regulation and transmission system support.

Unlike a centralized optimization-based energy management system, it schedules distributed energy resources and energy storage systems, as well as residential appliances, indirectly through iterative interaction between the microgrid central controller and home energy management systems, based on price signals. In each iteration, the microgrid central controller adjusts the scheduling of distributed energy resources and energy storage systems at the microgrid level. Meanwhile, the home energy management system of each house adjusts the scheduling of residential appliances. Then, the energy price at each bus is updated according to the unbalanced power between generation and demand. The optimization converges when the unbalanced power of all buses is close to zero, i.e., the microgrid central controller and home energy management systems reach an agreement on the energy price and generation/consumption. In particular, a detailed thermal dynamic model of the house is integrated into the HEMS scheduling for intelligent control of the heating, ventilation, and air-conditioning system by customers. Lastly, the distribution network is also considered to make the energy price signal locational. Results of case studies validate the efficacy of the proposed distributed energy management system.","Elsevier","","Oak Ridge National Lab.

The framework optimizes the operation of both DERs that are individually controllable and groups of DERs (i.e., aggregations) that are jointly controlled at an electrical point of connection. From an electrical standpoint, wye and delta single- and multi-phase connections are accounted for. The algorithm enables (groups of) DERs to pursue given performance objectives, while adjusting their (aggregate) powers to respond to services requested by grid operators and to maintain electrical quantities within engineering limits. The design of the algorithm leverages a time-varying bi-level problem formulation capturing various performance objectives and engineering constraints, and an online implementation of primal-dual projected-gradient methods. The gradient steps are suitably modified to accommodate appropriate measurements from the distribution network and the DERs. Stability and convergence claims are established in terms of tracking of the solution of the time-varying optimization problem. Finally, the method is tested in a realistic distribution.","IEEE","","National Renewable Energy Lab.

The proposed synthesis includes an optimal tracker as the seed controller and explicitly imposes all the relevant constraints on system input, on the rate of change in the input, and on system output by using the tools of barrier functions, input-output feedback linearization, comparison argument, Lyapunov argument, and a real-time constrained optimization. The proposed design is applied to microgrid operation with high penetration of renewable generation, where net load and variable generation must be balanced and the microgrid should be operated at an optimal or near-optimal performance level. Since traditional generation has a limited ramping rate, battery storage devices and demand responses become necessary to effectively deal with variability of renewable generation and to maintain frequency stability, but their capacities are also limited. Finally,it is shown that the proposed design is effective for coordinated control of traditional generation, storage and demand response so that the power system frequency is guaranteed to be within the required operational limits and that renewable curtailment is eliminated or minimized.","IEEE","","Univ. of Central Florida, Orlando, FL (United States)","USDOE Office of Energy Efficiency and Renewable Energy (EERE); National Science Foundation (NSF); US Department of Transportation","","United States","2019-07-16T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: IEEE Control Systems Letters; Journal Volume: 4; Journal Issue: 2","","Medium: ED; Size: p. 367-372","","","EE0007327; EE0007998; EE0006340; ECCS-1308928; ECCS-1552073; DTRT13-G-UTC51","Journal ID: ISSN 2475-1456","10.1109/LCSYS.2019.2929159","","2021-09-21T00:00:00Z","1601127","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/1601127","https://www.osti.gov/servlets/purl/1601127","IEEE Control Systems Letters","2","4"

Using the proposed method, the daily consumption of unobserved customers is extracted from their monthly billing data based on three machine learning models. In the first model, a spectral clustering algorithm is used to infer the typical daily load profiles of customers with SMs. Each typical daily load behavior represents a distinct class of customer behavior. In the second module, a multi-timescale learning model is trained to estimate the hourly consumption using monthly energy data for the customers of each class. The third stage leverages a recursive Bayesian learning method and branch current state estimation residuals to estimate the daily load profiles of unobserved customers without SMs. Furthermore, the proposed data-driven method has been tested and verified using real utility data.","IEEE","","Iowa State Univ., Ames, IA (United States)","USDOE Office of Electricity (OE)","","United States","2019-01-17T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: IEEE Transactions on Power Systems; Journal Volume: 34; Journal Issue: 4","","Medium: ED; Size: p. 3168-3177","","","OE0000875","Journal ID: ISSN 0885-8950","10.1109/tpwrs.2019.2893821","","2023-03-17T00:00:00Z","1961200","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/1961200","https://www.osti.gov/servlets/purl/1961200","IEEE Transactions on Power Systems","4","34"

The proposed technique is based on a game-theoretic expansion of relevance vector machines (RVMs). This platform is able to estimate the nodal power consumption and quantify its uncertainty while reducing the prohibitive computational burden of model training for large AMI datasets. To achieve this objective, the large training set is decomposed and distributed among multiple parallel learning entities. The resulting estimations from the parallel RVMs are then combined using a game-theoretic model based on the idea of repeated games with vector payoff. It is observed that through this approach and by exploiting the seasonal changes in customers’ behavior the accuracy of pseudo-measurements can be considerably improved, while introducing robustness against bad training data samples. The proposed pseudo-measurement generation model is integrated into a DSSE using a closed-loop information system, which takes advantage of a branch current state estimator (BCSE) to further improve the performance of the designed machine learning framework. This method has been tested on a practical distribution feeder model with smart meter data for verification.","IEEE","","Iowa State Univ., Ames, IA (United States)","USDOE Office of Electricity (OE)","","United States","2019-01-17T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: IEEE Transactions on Smart Grid; Journal Volume: 10; Journal Issue: 6","","Medium: ED; Size: p. 5942-5951","","","OE0000875","Journal ID: ISSN 1949-3053","10.1109/tsg.2019.2893818","","2023-03-17T00:00:00Z","1961204","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/1961204","https://www.osti.gov/servlets/purl/1961204","IEEE Transactions on Smart Grid","6","10"

Further, a stochastic optimization model is proposed for multi-fidelity co-optimization of energy and flexibility reserve in day-ahead power systems operation. The proposed model integrates operation decisions with different levels of modeling fidelity in a single stochastic optimization problem. More specifically, day-ahead energy trajectories, day-ahead flexibility reserve capacity trajectories, and real-time flexibility reserve deployment trajectories are modeled by Bernstein polynomials with different degrees as required to match the load and renewable generation with different levels of variability in day-ahead and real-time operations. The proposed model is implemented on the IEEE reliability test system using load and solar generation data of California ISO, where the numerical results demonstrate that the proposed model schedules a reserve capacity that more accurately matches the real-time energy imbalance and ramping requirements of net-load, while reducing the total operation cost of the system.","IEEE","","Univ. of Utah, Salt Lake City, UT (United States)","USDOE Office of Electricity (OE)","","United States","2019-07-09T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: IEEE Transactions on Smart Grid; Journal Volume: 11; Journal Issue: 1","","Medium: ED; Size: p. 644-654","","","OE0000882","Journal ID: ISSN 1949-3053","10.1109/tsg.2019.2927600","","2022-06-08T00:00:00Z","1801339","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/1801339","https://www.osti.gov/servlets/purl/1801339","IEEE Transactions on Smart Grid","1","11"
"Real-Time Identifiability of Power Distribution Network Topologies With Limited Monitoring","Cavraro, Guido; Bernstein, Andrey; Kekatos, Vassilis; Zhang, Yingchen","24 POWER TRANSMISSION AND DISTRIBUTION; energy systems; identification; smart grid","Recovering the distribution grid topology in real time is essential to perform several distribution system operator (DSO) functions. DSOs often do not have any direct monitoring of switch statuses to track reconfiguration. At the same time, installing real-time meters at a large number of buses is challenging due to the cost of endowing every metered bus with a real-time communication channel. The goal of this letter is to develop a meter placement strategy allowing DSOs to deploy only few real-time meters. After casting the topology recovery task as an optimization problem, a meter placement strategy ensuring unique recovery of the true topology is devised. A graph-theoretical approach is pursued to partition the grid into connected portions called observable islands . The proposed strategy then simply requires installing a meter in the path between every pair of boundary nodes , i.e., ends of edges connecting two different islands. Under some ideal assumptions, this placement strategy ensures unique recovery of the topology. The approach is also validated through numerical simulations under realistic scenarios using a standard IEEE benchmark feeder.","IEEE","","National Renewable Energy Lab.

The motivation of our work is to fulfill a fast residential load control for frequency stability enhancement. For this purpose, a novel Mobile Distribution-level Phasor Measurement Unit (MDPMU) is developed for disturbance event detection, power mismatch estimation and fast load control. First, the systematic design of the MDPMU introduced. The proposed MDPMU has the major advantages of low cost and high frequency measurement accuracy. Second, the distribution-level measurement is utilized for the Rate Of Change Of Frequency (ROCOF) calculation. Upon detection of a power system frequency event, power mismatch is estimated at the early stage of the event. Details of a robust approach to calculate ROCOF and determine the event starting point are presented. Practical issues including the measurement reporting rate and estimation time are also examined. Finally, with the proposed control system, residential load responses can be controlled coordinately based on load availability and compensation prices offered by customers, providing adaptive frequency regulation service after large resource contingencies. The accuracy of frequency measurement and power mismatch estimation are evaluated via experimental analysis.

"A Stochastic Multi-Commodity Logistic Model for Disaster Preparation in Distribution Systems","Arif, Anmar; Wang, Zhaoyu; Chen, Chen; Chen, Bo","24 POWER TRANSMISSION AND DISTRIBUTION; stochastic programming; Allocation; disaster preparation; distribution system; extreme weather","In this paper, we propose a stochastic optimization approach for disaster preparation in distribution systems. For an upcoming storm, utilities should have a preparation plan that includes warehousing restoration supplies, securing staging sites (depots), and prepositioning crews and equipment. Pre-storm planning enables faster and more efficient post-disaster deploy ment of crews and equipment resources to damage locations. To assist utilities in making this important preparation, this paper develops a two-stage stochastic mixed integer linear program. The first stage determines the depots, number of crews in each site, and the amount of equipment. The second stage is the recourse action that deals with acquiring new equipment and assigning crews to repair damages in realized scenarios. The objective of the developed model is to minimize the costs of depots, crews, equipment, and penalty costs associated with delays in obtain ing equipment and restoration. We consider the uncertainties of damaged lines, number and type of equipment required, and expected repair times. The model is validated on modified IEEE 123-bus distribution test system.","IEEE","","Argonne National Lab.

To achieve this, the proposed coordinated frequency controller (CFC) enables the SCESS and PSH plant to provide the frequency response. The CFC scheme employs a dynamic droop characteristic in parallel with an integral controller and a distribution function. The dynamic droop characteristic determines the power production for frequency regulation employing a variable gain, which varies with the total capacity of the frequency control units and magnitude of the system frequency error with time; the gain increases with the frequency error, and thereby, arresting the frequency nadir at a higher level than in the conventional droop characteristic. In addition, the distribution function dispatches the power from the dynamic droop and integral controller to the control units in proportion to their headrooms; furthermore, the distribution function considers a sudden loss of generation from an SCESS by its operational constraint during the frequency support. Thus, the proposed dynamic frequency support scheme can enhance the short-term frequency stability for a frequency event.","","","National Renewable Energy Lab.

We demonstrate the application of EMP on a single-column air separation unit. The scheduling problem is cast as a mixed integer linear program that can be solved in a practical amount of time.

To properly size the optimal amount and location of de-energized loads in the presence of both conventional and renewable sources, a precise optimization-based load recovery tool is proposed in this paper. The steady-state and transient behaviors of loads have been taken into account. The proposed tool contains three separate problems that interact with each other during the restoration period. The first-level problem determines the dispatching of generation units. The second-level problem comprises the non-linear algebraic equations, whose task is to provide the initial conditions for the third-level problem. Finally, the third-level problem intends to determine the optimal location and amount of load pickup through modeling the governor of generators as well as loads' dynamic behaviors. To examine the effectiveness of the proposed tool, a modified IEEE 39-system under a partial blackout condition has been tested. The results are verified by a commercial time-domain simulation software (PSS/E) to demonstrate the accuracy of the proposed approach. Ultimately, the impact of wind turbine frequency control on the load recovery process has been studied under different penetration levels.","IEEE","","Univ. of Central Florida, Orlando, FL (United States)","USDOE Office of Energy Efficiency and Renewable Energy (EERE); National Science Foundation (NSF)","","United States","2019-06-13T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: IEEE Transactions on Power Systems; Journal Volume: 34; Journal Issue: 6","","Medium: ED; Size: p. 4204-4215","","","EE0007327; ECCS-1552073; EE0007998","Journal ID: ISSN 0885-8950","10.1109/TPWRS.2019.2922653","","2021-09-21T00:00:00Z","1601128","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/1601128","https://www.osti.gov/servlets/purl/1601128","IEEE Transactions on Power Systems","6","34"

Meanwhile, the significantly increasing deployment of wind power necessitates that IEGSs operation considers wind power output uncertainty. How to model the impact of wind power uncertainty on IEGSs power and gas flows dispatch is challenging. In this paper, a hybrid distributionally-robust chance-constrained and interval optimization (DRCC-IO) based model is proposed to consider the influence of wind power uncertainty and its spatial-temporal correlation on IEGSs operation. First, the DRCC-OPF model is proposed to obtain reliable economic dispatch solutions for the electricity network considering the wind power forecast errors. The spatial-temporal correlation of the wind power plant (WPP) forecasts is considered with a sparse correlation covariance matrix. Then, the interval optimization (IO) model is used to model the impacts of the power variations of gas-fired units on the natural gas network. Finally, the proposed model considers the impacts of wind power uncertainty on both the electricity and natural gas networks. Case studies performed on a six-bus power system coupled with a seven-node gas system and an IEEE 118-bus power system with a 14-node gas system verify the effectiveness of the proposed method to improve system security and reduce costs of the IEGSs. The robustness of the wind power forecast errors can be controlled in the proposed model to trade off the security and costs of the IEGSs.","","","National Renewable Energy Lab.

We define a very general class of purely local feedback controllers in which reactive power injection is adjusted based on the local voltage measurements. This class includes most of the solutions proposed in the literature and in the latest grid codes. We show that these strategies do not guarantee the desired regulation, as each of them can have an equilibrium that is not feasible with respect to the desired voltage and power constraints. We then propose a networked feedback law to show that, by adding short-range communication between microgenerators, it is possible to design control strategies that provably converge to the feasible set. This fundamental performance gap between local and networked strategies is finally illustrated via simulations.","","","National Renewable Energy Lab.

In the proposed algorithm, each DER only maintains a set of variables and updates them through information exchange with a few neighboring DERs over a time-varying directed communication network. We show that the proposed distributed algorithm with appropriately chosen diminishing step-sizes solves the optimal DER coordination problem if the time-varying directed communication network is uniformly jointly strongly connected. Moreover, in order to improve the convergence speed and to reduce the communication burden, we propose an accelerated distributed algorithm with a fixed step-size. We show that the new proposed algorithm exponentially solves the optimal DER coordination problem if the cost functions satisfy an additional assumption and the selected step-size is less than a certain critical value.

"Individual Load Model Parameter Estimation in Distribution Systems Using Load Switching Events","Shahsavari, Alireza; Farajollahi, Mohammad; Mohsenian-Rad, Hamed","24 POWER TRANSMISSION AND DISTRIBUTION","There currently exists a mature literature on modeling the aggregate load of a distribution feeder by making use of measurements at its feeder-head at substation. The primary application of such feeder-aggregated load models is in sub-transmission or transmission system analysis. However, there is a growing need in practice also to model each individual load across the feeder. If available, such individual load models have applications in power distribution system analysis, e.g., to better integrate distributed energy resources or to improve power quality and reliability. Motivated by this observation, in this paper, we propose a new method for individual load modeling in power distribution systems. It works by using the measurements only at the feeder-head. It takes an innovative approach to analyzing the load switching events across the distribution feeder itself, instead of or in addition to relying on upstream voltage events that are commonly used in feeder-aggregated load modeling. By tracking the downstream load switching events, the proposed method can make a robust estimation of the ZIP load model parameters for all individual loads. The proposed method is examined on small illustrative test-feeders as well as the IEEE 33-bus test system under various operating scenarios. The adverse impact of errors in measurements and system parameters are also investigated on the performance of the developed load modeling method.","IEEE","","Univ. of California, Riverside, CA (United States)","USDOE Office of Energy Efficiency and Renewable Energy (EERE)","","United States","2019-06-04T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: IEEE Transactions on Power Systems; Journal Volume: 34; Journal Issue: 6","","Medium: ED; Size: p. 4652-4664","","","EE0008001","Journal ID: ISSN 0885-8950","10.1109/tpwrs.2019.2919901","","2022-06-02T00:00:00Z","1799415","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/1799415","https://www.osti.gov/servlets/purl/1799415","IEEE Transactions on Power Systems","6","34"

Such a behavior makes interaction among the nodes a game. We characterize Nash equilibrium of the game as the optimum of a global optimization problem and establish its asymptotic global stability. We also show that the signal-anticipating voltage control has less restrictive convergence condition than the signal-taking control. We then introduce the notion of price of signal-anticipation (PoSA) to characterize the impact of signal-anticipating control, and use the gap in cost between network equilibrium in the signal-taking control and Nash equilibrium in the signal-anticipating control as the metric for PoSA. We characterize how the PoSA scales with the size, topology, and heterogeneity of the distribution network for a few network settings. Our results show that the PoSA is upper bounded by a constant and the average PoSA per node will go to zero as the size of the network increases. This is desirable as it means that the PoSA will not be arbitrarily large, no matter what the size of the network is, and no mechanism is needed to mitigate the signal-anticipating behavior. We further carry out numerical experiments with a real-world distribution circuit to complement the theoretical analysis.","","","National Renewable Energy Lab.

"Stochastic Optimization with Risk Aversion for Virtual Power Plant Operations: A Rolling Horizon Control","Castillo, Andrea; Flicker, Jack; Johnson, Jay; Hansen, Clifford W.; Watson, Jean -Paul","24 POWER TRANSMISSION AND DISTRIBUTION","While the concept of aggregating and controlling renewable distributed energy resources (DERs) to provide grid services is not new, increasing policy support of DER market participation has driven research and development in algorithms to pool DERs for economically viable market participation. Sandia National Laboratories recently undertook a three-year research program to create the components of a real-world virtual power plant (VPP) that can simultaneously participate in multiple markets. Our research extends current state-of-the-art rolling horizon control through the application of stochastic programming with risk aversion at various time resolutions. Our rolling horizon control consists of (1) day-ahead optimization to produce an hourly aggregate schedule for the VPP operator and (2) sub-hourly optimization for real-time dispatch of each VPP subresource. Both optimization routines leverage a two-stage stochastic program (SP) with risk aversion, and integrate the most up-to-date forecasts to generate probabilistic scenarios in real operating time. Our results demonstrate the benefits to the VPP operator of constructing a stochastic solution regardless of the weather. In more extreme weather, applying risk optimization strategies can dramatically increase the financial viability of the VPP. As a result, the methodologies presented here can be further tailored for optimal control of any VPP asset fleet and its operational requirements.","Institution of Engineering and Technology","","Sandia National Lab.

This report introduces an approach to reflect the existence of multiple system operators making scheduling decisions within an interconnected power system. The approach is explicitly designed to reflect each operator's limited knowledge about other regions when making scheduling decisions. Detailed analysis using a modified IEEE Reliability Test System reveals that the approach mimics real system operations by providing imperfect information to each operator about external operations and external constraints. The approach scales to a 78,000-bus model of the Eastern Interconnection, where a regression analysis provides quantitative insight into which constraints cause inefficiencies when improperly managed in a multi-operator simulation. Because the approach generates distinct regional scheduling problems, unit commitment and economic dispatch simulations can be applied to individual regions and solved in parallel, enabling production cost simulations at a previously intractable scale.","IEEE","","National Renewable Energy Lab.

We study the target hosting capacity problem where the objective is to find the least-cost sequence of system upgrades to reach a predefined hosting capacity target value. We show that commonly used short-term cost minimization approaches often lead to suboptimal long-term solutions. By comparing our method against such myopic techniques on real distribution systems, we show that our algorithm is able to reduce the overall integration costs by looking at future decisions. Because hosting capacity is hard to compute, this problem requires efficient methods to search the space. We demonstrate that heuristics using domain-specific knowledge can be efficiently used to improve the algorithm performance, such that real distribution systems can be studied.","","","National Renewable Energy Lab.

"Introducing Uncertainty Components in Locational Marginal Prices for Pricing Wind Power and Load Uncertainties","Fang, Xin; Hodge, Bri-Mathias Scott; Du, Ershun; Kang, Chongqing; Li, Fangxing Fran","24 POWER TRANSMISSION AND DISTRIBUTION; economic dispatch; locational marginal price (LMP); uncertainty; optimal power flow; chance constrained optimization","With substantially increasing penetration levels of wind power, electric power system flexibility is needed to address the variability and uncertainty of wind power output. Thus, it has become an urgent issue to obtain an optimal trade-off between economics and reliability, and to price system uncertainties. This paper proposes a new electricity market-clearing mechanism based on locational marginal prices (LMPs) for pricing uncertain generation and load. The uncertainty contained locational marginal price (U-LMP) is derived from a distributionally robust chance-constrained optimal power flow (DRCC-OPF) model in which only the first-order and second-order moments of the uncertain sources' probability distribution are needed. Compared with traditional LMPs, the proposed U-LMP formulation includes two new uncertainty components: transmission line overload uncertainty price and generation violation uncertainty price. These LMP uncertainty components are the price signals reflecting the system costs as a result of wind generation and demand uncertainty at different locations. Finally, using parametric case studies, the relationship among uncertainty levels, system generation cost, and LMP uncertainty components are established. Case studies performed on the PJM 5-bus and IEEE 118-bus systems verify the proposed U-LMP method.","IEEE","","National Renewable Energy Lab.

"Mechanism Design for Demand Response Programs","Muthirayan, Deepan; Kalathil, Dileep; Poolla, Kameshwar; Varaiya, Pravin","24 POWER TRANSMISSION AND DISTRIBUTION; demand response; baseline estimation; demand-side management; smart grids","Demand response (DR) programs serve to reduce the consumption of electricity at times when the supply is scarce and expensive. Consumers or agents with flexible consumption profiles are recruited by an aggregator who manages the DR program. The aggregator calls on a subset of its pool of recruited agents to reduce their electricity use during DR events. Agents are paid for reducing their energy consumption from contractually established baselines. Baselines are counter-factual consumption estimates of the energy an agent would have consumed if they were not participating in the DR program. Baselines are used to determine payments to agents. This creates an incentive for agents to inflate their baselines in order to increase the payments they receive. There are several newsworthy cases of agents gaming their baseline for economic benefit. We propose a novel self-reported baseline mechanism (SRBM) where each agent reports its baseline and marginal utility. These reports are strategic and need not be truthful. Based on the reported information, the aggregator selects or calls on agents with a certain probability to meet the load reduction target. Called agents are paid for observed reductions from their self-reported baselines. Agents who are not called face penalties for consumption shortfalls below their baselines. Under SRBM, we show that truthful reporting of baseline consumption and marginal utility is a dominant strategy. Thus, SRBM eliminates the incentive for agents to inflate baselines. SRBM is assured to meet the load reduction target. To conclude, we show that SRBM is almost optimal in the metric of average cost of DR provision faced by the aggregator.","IEEE","","Lawrence Berkeley National Lab.

In the design stage, the event occurrence time and duration, which are highly uncertain and cannot be effectively predicted, may affect the needed battery and backup generator capacity but are usually assumed to be pre-determined in utility planning tools. This study investigates the optimal battery and backup generator sizing problem considering the stochastic event occurrence time and duration for the grid-tied microgrid under islanded operation. The reliability requirement is quantified by the mean value of the critical customer interruption time in each stochastic islanding time window (ITW), whose length is the duration and the centre is the occurrence time. The stochastic ITW constraint is then transformed to a probability-weighted expression to derive an equivalent Mixed Integer Linear Programming model. Numerical simulations on a realistic grid-tied PV-based microgrid demonstrate that the total cost is reduced by 11.5% considering the stochastic ITW, compared with the deterministic ITW under the same reliability requirement.","Institution of Engineering and Technology","","Oak Ridge National Lab.

The increased integration of distributed energy resources (DERs) is bringing a number of challenges to the power grid. These include reverse power flows in distribution systems and potentially transmission systems and grid stability. So far, specialized tools have been developed to capture some of the impact of DERs at the distribution level. However, distribution system operators lack visibility into the overall system conditions. Furthermore, the impact of increasing DERs is not limited to the distribution level but also influences the transmission grid. To support the planning and operation of the grid, we developed a co-simulation platform called CyDER (A Cyber Physical Co-simulation Platform for Distributed Energy Resources in Smart Grids) that integrates various domain-specific simulation tools. CyDER is based on the functional mock-up interface standard. This paper gives an overview of CyDER and demonstrates its use based on two applications.","Taylor & Francis","External Audience (Unlimited)","Lawrence Livermore National Lab.

"Setting cost targets for zero-emission electricity generation technologies","Mai, Trieu T.; Cole, Wesley J.; Reimers, Andrew","24 POWER TRANSMISSION AND DISTRIBUTION; 29 ENERGY PLANNING, POLICY, AND ECONOMY; power system modeling; energy economics; technology innovation; grid integration","Clean energy deployment scenarios typically assume a diverse mix of low-emission generation. However, because of historically low natural gas prices and cost reductions for onshore wind and photovoltaic technologies, recent new capacity deployment, especially in the United States, has come largely from these three generation sources. Here, we quantify competitive cost targets for three less-common zero-emission generation technologies -- nuclear, concentrating solar, and offshore wind -- under a range of future conditions. We determine the cost targets based on the technologies' system value, such that technology value equals or exceeds its cost. Using a capacity expansion model that develops system-wide, economically optimal generation scenarios of the United States power sector, we find that nuclear, concentrating solar, and offshore wind would need to attain levelized cost ranges of $53-84/MWh, $65-91/MWh, and $39-77/MWh, respectively, to achieve 1% additional grid penetration. We refer to this metric as the 'required cost,' which is a technology's levelized cost of energy needed to achieve a specific penetration level. Higher penetrations lead to lower required costs as lower-cost generation is displaced. We estimate that to reach 10% penetration, the required cost for nuclear declines to $45-76/MWh. Because of resource variability and increased transmission needs for concentrating solar power and offshore wind, even lower costs are needed to reach higher penetrations: required cost ranges to achieve 10% penetration are estimated to be $30-56/MWh and $18-40/MWh for these two technologies respectively. Our analysis informs research and development priorities and the design of policies supporting clean technologies.","Elsevier","","National Renewable Energy Lab.

We add to the current body of literature by outlining a framework which properly accounts for the effects of outage duration. We begin by separating costs into categories depending on whether the cost varies with outage duration and whether the cost is due to perishable inventory. We derive useful functional forms for each cost category and discuss how parameters vary by load type and outage characteristics. We derive outage cost estimates for an unexpected loss of power to both an example manufacturing plant and an example fire station. The framework described in this paper can easily be employed to model outage costs for a wide range of specific operating conditions.","Springer","","National Renewable Energy Lab.

"Spillover as a cause of bias in baseline evaluation methods for demand response programs","Todd, Annika; Cappers, Peter; Spurlock, C. Anna; Jin, Ling","24 POWER TRANSMISSION AND DISTRIBUTION; Baseline prediction; Demand response; Critical peak pricing; Peak demand savings; Experimental design; Randomized control trials","Prior research has shown load reduction estimates from residential event-driven demand response programs (e.g., Critical Peak Pricing)using X of the highest Y days with a weather adjustment method are the best performing within the class of currently used baseline methods. However, they are still biased relative to estimates produced from randomized control trials (RCTs), the unbiased “gold standard” evaluation method. In this paper we identify underlying factors that cause some of the bias found in one commonly used baseline method. Rather than simply quantifying bias, our research provides a deeper understanding of what causes the bias and thus can be used to develop more accurate methods that are not subject to these underlying factors. Previous studies have compared various baseline methods relative to each other; however, because all baseline methods are biased, it is impossible to determine the true bias that exists in them. We have access to a unique RCT dataset: the Sacramento Municipal Utility District's study of critical peak pricing. Our analysis of 23 event days over two summers allows us to identify the true bias on load reduction estimates by using the RCT estimates as the unbiased gold standard against which we compare the estimates from the baseline methods. We found that spillover of energy reductions, from hours targeted by a program onto other hours, is one underlying factor that is a major cause of bias in baseline methods. We discuss alternative baseline methods that may not be subject to this same bias.","Elsevier","","Lawrence Berkeley National Lab.

In this context, the present study considers here the potential impact of the HEMP early-time component (E1) on the winding of a typical transmission power line transformer. A time-domain, fully electromagnetic, three-dimensional, finite-element model was used to simulate the propagation of an E1-induced voltage surge into the transformer winding. The analysis is focused on the first few turns of the winding, the ones that are impacted by the largest electric field resulting from the applied pulse. The model follows the transient dynamics, while the pulse is traveling along the conductor, and the electric field is established across the insulation gaps through capacitive coupling. The simulations also considered the effect of an electrically floating, “shield” winding conductor. This is used as a countermeasure to improve the voltage uniformity across the winding during fast-rise transients. In this case, the propagation of the E1-induced pulse is compared with that from a slower rising, lightning standard waveform. The simulation results show that the presence of the shield conductor can effectively reduce the peak electric field between winding turns, in the presence of either E1 or lightning waveforms.","IEEE","","Oak Ridge National Lab.

New technologies in modern distribution systems bring opportunities and challenges to distribution system restoration. As fast response energy resources, plug-in hybrid electric vehicles (PHEVs) can accelerate the load pickup by compensating the imbalance between available generation and distribution system load. This study provides a bottom-up restoration strategy to use PHEVs for reliable load pickup and faster restoration process. The optimisation problem of finding load pickup sequence to maximise restored energy is formulated as a mixed integer linear programming (MILP) problem. Moreover, the coordination between transmission and distribution restoration is developed to efficiently restore the entire system back to normal operating conditions. Simulation results on one 100-feeder test system demonstrate the efficiency of MILP-based restoration strategy and the benefit from PHEVs to restore more energy in given restoration time. The proposed restoration strategy has great potential to facilitate system operators to achieve efficient system restoration plans. It also provides incentives to deploy a large amount of PHEVs to improve system resiliency.","The Institution of Engineering and Technology","","Univ. of Central Florida, Orlando, FL (United States)","USDOE Office of Energy Efficiency and Renewable Energy (EERE); National Science Foundation (NSF)","","United States","2018-10-26T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: IET Smart Grid; Journal Volume: 2; Journal Issue: 1","","Medium: ED; Size: p. 42-49","","","EE0007327; ECCS-1552073","Journal ID: ISSN 2515-2947","10.1049/iet-stg.2018.0054","","2021-01-13T00:00:00Z","1601135","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/1601135","https://www.osti.gov/servlets/purl/1601135","IET Smart Grid","1","2"

Furthermore, it can generate timing signal within 1μs drift to maintain measurement accuracy level for more than 1.5 hours in holdover state.

The flexibility of operating in grid-connected or islanded modes enables a microgrid to serve loads reliably. In the case of unexpected events happening to the main grid, the microgrid will isolate itself and operate in islanded mode to prevent any adversary impacts. The availability of renewable generation in the microgrid has significant impacts on the islanding strategy and different scenarios need to be considered. This study proposes a comprehensive microgrid self-healing strategy under different circumstances. The proposed strategy encompasses generation re-dispatch, network reconfiguration, and load shedding. The microgrid self-healing problem is formulated as a mixed-integer quadratic programming problem, which provides a globally optimal solution to facilitate smooth islanding of the microgrid.

"The Role of Input Assumptions and Model Structures in Projections of Variable Renewable Energy: A Multi-Model Perspective of the U.S. Electricity System","Mai, Trieu; Bistline, John; Sun, Yinong; Cole, Wesley; Marcy, Cara; Namovicz, Chris; Young, David","24 POWER TRANSMISSION AND DISTRIBUTION; 29 ENERGY PLANNING, POLICY, AND ECONOMY; renewable energy; intermodel comparison; capacity expansion modeling; grid integration","Recent wind and solar deployment in the United States has grown at unprecedented rates, but the extent to which this growth will continue is a key question. Energy-economic planning models are often used to develop future projections of these technologies, and although it is well-understood that model outcomes are sensitive to assumptions about technology developments and market conditions, it is less clear how underlying model structures might impact outcomes. For wind and solar technologies, model structures might be an even larger driver due to the complexity required to represent their variability, uncertainty, and location-dependence. Here, we apply three state-of-the-art electric sector planning models to evaluate variable renewable generation under different conditions with both harmonized and native input assumptions to isolate the impact that model structures might have on deployment outcomes. We find growth in wind and solar deployment in all models under a business-as-usual scenario (without new policies), where the median value for variable renewable energy generation share is found to be 27% by 2050 - but with a wide range of estimates (18-43%), types of renewable technologies deployed, and regional distributions across models. With harmonized assumptions about technology costs and market conditions the range narrows slightly, but a large range in penetration outcomes remains (24-41% by 2050) suggesting that model representations play significant roles in projections of future wind and solar deployment. We also assess the implications of achieving 55% wind and solar penetration by 2050 - to assess potential challenges at higher penetration levels - and the magnitude of variable generation under a carbon-constrained future. Finally, we identify research needs to better assess the future deployment of variable renewable energy.","Elsevier","","National Renewable Energy Lab.

The nature of failure propagation and extent of damage, among other factors, is dependent on the structural features of the grid, that are distinct from that of random networks. This paper analyzes the structural vulnerability of real power grids to impending disasters and presents intuitive graphical metrics to quantify the extent of topological damage. We develop two improved graph eigen-value based bounds on the grid vulnerability. Further we study adversarial attacks aimed at weakening the grid’s structural robustness and present three combinatorial algorithms to determine the optimal topological attack. Simulations on power grid networks and comparison with existing work show the improvements of the proposed measures and attack schemes.","Public Library of Science","","Los Alamos National Lab.

"A Novel Transactive Energy Control Mechanism for Collaborative Networked Microgrids","Liu, Weijia; Zhan, Junpeng; Chung, C. Y.","24 POWER TRANSMISSION AND DISTRIBUTION; decentralized optimization; electricity market; networked microgrids; renewable energy; transactive energy control","Collaboration of networked microgrids (NMGs) with diverse generation sources is a promising solution to smooth volatile generation output and enhance the utilization efficiency of renewable energies. In addition to centralized and decentralized collaboration mechanisms, transactive energy control (TEC) is an emerging and effective market-based control to enable energy transactions among distributed entities such as NMGs. However, existing studies on TEC suffer from several major weaknesses such as unconstrained/simplified model formulations and slow convergence rates. This paper proposes here a novel TEC mechanism to tackle these weaknesses. First, the centralized mechanism, de-centralized mechanism, and subgradient-based TEC mechanism to coordinate the operation of NMGs are briefly reviewed and modeled by a scenario-based stochastic optimization method. A new TEC mechanism is then proposed, consisting of a TEC framework, mathematical model, pricing rule, and algorithm. The optimality of the proposed TEC mathematical model and pricing rule is demonstrated. The effectiveness of the proposed TEC mechanism is verified in case studies where the NMGs operate in grid-connected, islanded, and congested modes. The advantages of the proposed TEC mechanism are also illustrated through comparisons with the centralized mechanism, decentralized mechanism, and subgradient-based TEC mechanism.","IEEE","","Brookhaven National Lab.

To this end, the newly developed notion of information transfer between the states of a dynamical system is used. In particular, using the concept of information transfer, which characterizes influence between the various states of a dynamical system, we identify the generators and states which are responsible for causing instability of the power network. While characterizing influence from state to state, information transfer can also describe influence from state to modes thereby generalizing the well-known notion of participation factor while at the same time overcoming some of the limitations of the participation factor. The developed framework is applied to reproduce known results for the three bus system, identifying the various causes of instabilities, and is extended to IEEE 39 bus system.","IEEE","","Iowa State Univ., Ames, IA (United States)","USDOE Office of Electricity (OE)","","United States","2019-04-09T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: IEEE Transactions on Power Systems; Journal Volume: 34; Journal Issue: 5","","Medium: ED; Size: p. 3804-3812","","","OE0000876","Journal ID: ISSN 0885-8950","10.1109/TPWRS.2019.2909723","","2020-04-09T00:00:00Z","1572391","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/1572391","https://www.osti.gov/servlets/purl/1572391","IEEE Transactions on Power Systems","5","34"

Firstly, based on the energy hub model, a generic method for modelling the steady-state energy balance equation of MES is proposed. Then, considering the multi-energy substitution effect in the background of multi-energy coupling, the concept of price-based integrated demand response (P-IDR) is introduced. Meanwhile, based on the price elasticity theory and the discrete choice theory, the energy timing transfer characteristics and energy substitution characteristics in P-IDR is modelled. Furthermore, after taking into account the P-IDR, an MINLP model for day-ahead dispatch of MES is built, and a generalized benders decomposition method is used for solution. Case studies are conducted on an MES to verify the effectiveness of the proposed modelling method. Here, the result shows that it is beneficial to improve renewable energy accommodation and reduce the peak and off-peak difference of energy load when the P-IDR is deployed. In addition, consider the energy substitution characteristics can reduce the user’s cost on energy purchase and be more in line with the user’s rational consumption behaviour.","Elsevier","","Univ. of Central Florida, Orlando, FL (United States)","USDOE Office of Energy Efficiency and Renewable Energy (EERE)","","United States","2019-04-02T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: Energy (Oxford); Journal Volume: 176; Journal Issue: C","","Medium: ED; Size: p. 171-183","","","EE0007327","Journal ID: ISSN 0360-5442","10.1016/j.energy.2019.04.004","","2020-04-02T00:00:00Z","1592333","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/1592333","https://www.osti.gov/servlets/purl/1592333","Energy (Oxford)","C","176"

However, such gas generation systems are typically focused on hydrogen production, which has compatibility issues with the existing natural gas pipeline infrastructures. This study presents a power-to-synthetic natural gas (SNG) plant design and a techno-economic analysis of its performance for producing SNG by reacting renewably generated hydrogen from low-temperature electrolysis with captured carbon dioxide. The study presents a 'bulk' methanation process that is unique due to the high concentration of carbon oxides and hydrogen. Carbon dioxide, as the only carbon feedstock, has much different reaction characteristics than carbon monoxide. Thermodynamic and kinetic considerations of the methanation reaction are explored to design a system of multistaged reactors for the conversion of hydrogen and carbon dioxide to SNG. Heat recuperation from the methanation reaction is accomplished using organic Rankine cycle (ORC) units to generate electricity. The product SNG has a Wobbe index of 47.5?MJ/m3 and the overall plant efficiency (H2/CO2 to SNG) is shown to be 78.1% LHV (83.2% HHV). The nominal production cost for SNG is estimated at 132 $/MWh (38.8 $/MMBTU) with 3 $/kg hydrogen and a 65% capacity factor. At U.S. DOE target hydrogen production costs (2.2 $/kg), SNG cost is estimated to be as low as 97.6 $/MWh (28.6 $/MMBtu or 1.46 $/kgSNG).","ASME","","National Renewable Energy Lab.

The buyers can adjust the energy consumption behavior based on the price and quantity of the energy offered by the sellers. There exist two separate competitions during the trading process: 1) price competition among the sellers; and 2) seller selection competition among the buyers. The price competition among the sellers is modeled as a noncooperative game. The evolutionary game theory is used to model the dynamics of the buyers for selecting sellers. Moreover, an M-leader and N-follower Stackelberg game approach is used to model the interaction between buyers and sellers. Two iterative algorithms are proposed for the implementation of the games such that an equilibrium state exists in each of the games. The proposed method is applied to a small community microgrid with photo-voltaic and energy storage systems. Simulation results show the convergence of the algorithms and the effectiveness of the proposed model to handle P2P energy trading. The results also show that P2P energy trading provides significant financial and technical benefits to the community, and it is emerging as an alternative to cost-intensive energy storage systems.","IEEE","","National Renewable Energy Lab.

The design of the algorithm is based on continuous-time primal-dual dynamics, properly modified to incorporate feedback from the LTI dynamical system, applied to a proximal augmented Lagrangian function. The resultant closed-loop algorithm tracks the solution of the time-varying optimization problem without requiring knowledge of (time-varying) disturbances in the dynamical system. The analysis leverages integral quadratic constraints to provide linear matrix inequality (LMI) conditions that guarantee global exponential stability and bounded tracking error. Analytical results show that, under a sufficient time-scale separation between the dynamics of the LTI dynamical system and the algorithm, the LMI conditions can be always satisfied. The paper further proposes a modified algorithm that can track an approximate solution trajectory of the constrained optimization problem under less restrictive assumptions. As an illustrative example, the proposed algorithms are showcased for power transmission systems, to compress the time scales between secondary and tertiary control, and allow to simultaneously power re-balancing and tracking of DC optimal power flow points.","IEEE","","National Renewable Energy Lab.

These small energy-consuming devices are increasingly being aggregated for participation in grid markets, planning and operations. A cyber attack penetrating the control system of aggregated DERs could negatively impact the operation of the grid. In the worst case, the power grid could be severely damaged and physical safety compromised. In this paper we analyze cybersecurity risks associated with the aggregation of DERs and develop an approach to mitigating that risk. The approaches to both cyber risk analysis and mitigation were developed during a recent research project that serves as an example of how the approaches could be applied. However, both the risk analysis and mitigation are applicable to the broader domain of all DERs. An important conclusion is that the successful cyber compromise of aggregated DERs could have a significant impact on the bulk power system. This is the case even if each individual DER falls below the threshold of compliance with bulk-grid cybersecurity standards. For this reason, we specifically investigate how National Electricity Reliability Corporation's Critical Infrastructure Protection requirements could flow down to interactions between DER aggregators and the DERs themselves in order to protect the grid from these bulk-scale cyber attack impacts.","Elsevier","","National Renewable Energy Lab.

Detection of the EV ahead of its arrival will initiate energizing of the transmitter buried inside the road to enable just-in-time transfer of power. At low speeds, communication can be a reliable method to power up the transmitter coil. However, at high speeds on highways, communication latency time for the detection of an EV is long and hence impractical.

This paper presents a novel plug-and-play occupancy sensing method which will enable temporal minimization of building energy consumption to meet building usage behavior without privacy concerns. The proposed wireless occupancy sensing platform is based on long-wave infra-red (LWIR) focal-plane arrays (FPAs), or thermal imagers, that detect thermal energy rather than visible light. We developed an advanced sensor package consisting of multiple thermal imagers with low-cost optical enhancements to increase field of view and increase sensitivity to occupant detection (filtering building clutter). These imagers can be coupled with radio frequency and ultrasonic-based radar to enhance data collection at key occupant zone boundaries to improve accuracy. Standard filtering and estimation techniques from the image processing and computer vision communities are introduced to overcome the accuracy issues suffered by traditional PIR based sensing, especially when occupants remain relatively still. Accurate low-level counting of individuals can be achieved with minimal impact on privacy. As a result, the proposed occupancy detection method can work as a retrofit to enable real-time understanding of the building operational state and usage behavior. Sensor data obtained from real test building zones was used to test the efficacy of the method.","Elsevier","","Oak Ridge National Lab.

"Dynamic Capabilities of an Energy Storage-Embedded DFIG System","Kim, Jinho; Muljadi, Eduard; Gevorgian, Vahan; Hoke, Anderson F","24 POWER TRANSMISSION AND DISTRIBUTION; doubly fed induction generator; energy storage; frequency response; inertial response; renewable power plant","Power electronic-based wind turbine generators (WTGs) are capable of providing inertial response to the grid by releasing kinetic energy from the turbine blade; thus, as conventional power plants are retired, the reduction of online inertia can be compensated by designing frequency controls for the WTGs. Deployment of energy storage technology for renewable generations has been increased to have the renewables centralized with a system operator as an independent power supply by making up for their nature of generation. In addition, the cost of energy storage has dropped over time and global research activities on energy storage have been funded by private industries and governments. This paper investigates the opportunity of deploying an energy storage on a doubly fed induction generator (DFIG)-based WTG to respond to the system frequency, and then explores dynamic capabilities of the energy storage-embedded DFIG to boost its contribution while the frequency response is being provided by the power system's online inertia; thus, enabling an effective delivery of ancillary services to the system. To do this, the dynamic models of DFIG and energy storage are combined and simulated under the different operating conditions of a DFIG, such as subsynchronous, synchronous, and supersynchronous operations, using the PSCAD.","","","National Renewable Energy Lab.

The technologies used for this process are typically dependent on the quality and temperature grades of waste heat. To maximize the efficiency of cascade heat utilization, it is important to optimize the choice of waste heat recovery technologies and their operation. Here, a detailed mixed integer linear programming optimization model is proposed for waste heat recovery in a district-scale microgrid. The model can distinguish waste heat quality for planning and operation optimization of distributed energy systems. Heat utilization technologies are formulated in this developed model and categorized in different temperature grades. The developed model is validated using four typical cases under different settings of system operation and business models. It is found that the optimization model, by distinguishing waste heat temperature, can increase energy cost savings by around 5%, compared to models that do not consider waste heat temperature grades. Additionally, the results indicate that the developed model can provide more realistic configuration and technologies dispatch.","Elsevier","","Lawrence Berkeley National Lab.

However, it cannot predict the magnitude of resonance or explain resonance-generated distortions in the absence of an external disturbance at the resonance frequency. This paper presents an impedance-based theory for the prediction of the magnitude of resonance or resonance-generated distortions in grid-connected converters. It is discovered that the impedance response of a converter starts changing with the magnitude of resonance at its terminals. The changing converter impedance response may stabilize an unstable growing resonance mode beyond a certain magnitude, at which point the converter enters a limit cycle mode of sustained oscillations. The proposed theory uses large-signal impedance for the prediction of resonance-generated distortions; the large-signal impedance of an electrical equipment represents its impedance response for different magnitudes of perturbation injected at its terminals. Large-signal impedance-based prediction of resonance-generated distortions is demonstrated for a three-phase grid-connected voltage-source converter.","","","National Renewable Energy Lab.

"Resilient Reinforcement in Secure State Estimation against Sensor Attacks with a priori Information","Shinohara, Takumi; Namerikawa, Toru; Qu, Zhihua","42 ENGINEERING; 24 POWER TRANSMISSION AND DISTRIBUTION; system security; secure state estimation; sensor attacks","Recent control systems severe depend on information technology infrastructures, especially the Internet of things (IoT) devices, which create many opportunities for the interaction between the physical world and cyberspace. Due to the tight connection, however, cyber attacks have the potential to generate evil consequences for the physical entities, and therefore, securing control systems is a vital issue to be addressed for building smart societies. To this end, this paper especially deals with the state estimation problem in the presence of malicious sensor attacks. Unlike the existing work, in this paper, we consider the problem with a priori information of the state to be estimated. Specifically, we address three prior knowledge- the sparsity information, (α, $\bar{n}$ 0 )-sparsity information, and side information, and in each scenario, we show that the state can be reconstructed even if more sensors are compromised. This implies that the prior information reinforces the system resilience against malicious sensor attacks. Then, an estimator under sensor attacks considering the information is developed and, under a certain condition, the estimator can be relaxed into a tractable convex optimization problem. Further, we extend this analysis to systems in the presence of measurement noises, and it is shown that the prior information reduces the state-estimation error caused by the noise. The numerical simulations in a diffusion process finally illustrate the reinforcement and error-reduction results with the information.","IEEE","","Univ. of Central Florida, Orlando, FL (United States)","USDOE Office of Energy Efficiency and Renewable Energy (EERE), Renewable Power Office.

To damp inter-area oscillations, the controller modulates the power transfer of the PDCI, a ±500 kV DCtransmission line in the WI. The control system utilizes real-time phasor measurement unit feedback to construct a commanded power signal which is added to the scheduled power flow for the PDCI. After years of design, simulations, and development, this controller has been implemented in hardware and successfully tested in both open and closed-loop operation. The most important design specifications were safe, reliable performance, no degradation of any system modes in any circumstances, and improve damping to the controllable modes in the WI. The main finding is that the controller adds significant damping to the modes of the WI and does not adversely affect the system response in any of the test cases. The primary contribution of this paper, to the state of the art research, is the design methods and test results of the first North American real-time control system that uses wide area PMU feedback.","IEEE","","Sandia National Lab.

Note that the large-signal impedance of a network represents its impedance response for different magnitudes of perturbation injected at its terminals. This paper presents large-signal impedance-based modeling and mitigation of resonance of grid-connected voltage source converters (VSCs). Challenges of large-signal modeling because of the inapplicability of the small-signal approximation are addressed by leveraging the dominating influence of hard nonlinearities (such as pulse-width modulation saturation and limiters) over soft nonlinearities (such as Park's transformations and PLL) in shaping the large-signal behavior of the converter. The paper develops large-signal gains of hard nonlinearities using different types of describing functions. The paper shows that the large-signal impedance of a VSC can be shaped to reduce resonance-generated distortions by inserting limiters in the control system of the VSC. Developed large-signal impedance models are validated using numerical simulations of a VSC with dq current control and PLL. In conclusion, a large-signal impedance measurements of a commercial 1 MW VSC-based inverter and a medium-voltage doubly-fed induction generator with approximate 4 MW rating are presented to experimentally demonstrate the influence of the injected perturbation magnitude on the impedance response.","IEEE","","National Renewable Energy Lab.

"Joint Chance Constraints in AC Optimal Power Flow: Improving Bounds through Learning","Baker, Kyri; Bernstein, Andrey","24 POWER TRANSMISSION AND DISTRIBUTION; optimization; uncertainty; upper bound; voltage control; Monte Carlo methods; estimation; power systems","This paper considers distribution systems with a high penetration of distributed, renewable generation and addresses the problem of incorporating the associated uncertainty into the optimal operation of these networks. Joint chance constraints, which satisfy multiple constraints simultaneously with a prescribed probability, are one way to incorporate uncertainty across sets of constraints, leading to a chance-constrained optimal power flow problem. Departing from the computationally-heavy scenario-based approaches or approximations that transform the joint constraint into conservative deterministic constraints, this paper develops a scalable, data-driven approach which learns operational trends in a power network, eliminates zero-probability events (e.g., inactive constraints), and accurately and efficiently approximates bounds on the joint chance constraint iteratively. In particular, the proposed framework improves upon the classic methods based on the union bound (or Boole's inequality) by generating a much less conservative set of single chance constraints that also guarantees the satisfaction of the original joint constraint. The proposed framework is evaluated numerically using the IEEE 37-node test feeder, focusing on the problem of voltage regulation in distribution grids.","IEEE","","National Renewable Energy Lab.

Postmortem investigations reported that tripping commands were caused by phase-locked loops (PLLs) and dc-side dynamics, which are typically unmodeled in transient stability studies. Since existing simulation packages rely on simplified models that neglect these dynamics, they have a limited capability to predict converter behavior during faults. To address this shortcoming, we set forth a positive-sequence model for PV power plants that is derived from physics and controls first principles. As seen on utility-scale three-phase converters, the model includes PLLs, dc-side dynamics, and closed-loop controllers. Instances of the developed model are integrated into illustrative power systems containing also conventional generators.

How to model this spatial-temporal correlation in the actual system dispatch is challenging. In this paper, a sparse correlation matrix is utilized to efficiently model the spatial-temporal correlation of wind power forecast in the generation dispatch model. A novel, adjustable, and distributionally-robust chance-constrained multi-interval optimal power flow (ADRCC-MIOPF) model is proposed to obtain reliable economic dispatch (ED) solutions. The spatial-temporal correlation of wind power plants power forecasts is represented by the sparse correlation covariance matrix obtained from historical, time series wind power forecast error data. The chance constraints in the ADRCC-MIOPF model are transformed into a set of second-order-cone (SOC) constraints in which an adjustable coefficient in the chance constraints controls the robustness of the ADRCC-MIOPF model to the wind power forecast errors distribution. Case studies performed on the PJM 5-bus system and IEEE 118-bus system verify the proposed method to improve the system security and reduce the cost especially under the high wind penetration levels. All the cases can be solved within several minutes for both the small and large cases which validates the efficiency of the proposed sparse matrix model. In addition, considering the spatial-temporal correlation of wind power forecast and the distributional robustness of wind power forecast error leads to a more reliable economic dispatch with lower system violations.","Elsevier","","National Renewable Energy Lab.

The OPM uses regression tree models fed by numerical weather prediction outputs, spatially distributed information on soil, vegetation, electric utility assets, and historical power outage data to forecast the number and spatial distribution of outages across the power distribution grid. New modules introduced hereby consist in 1) a storm classifier based on weather variables; 2) a multimodel optimization of regression tree output; and 3) a post-processing routine for more accurately describing tree-leaf conditions. Model implementations are tested through leave-one-storm-out cross-validations performed on 120 storms of varying intensity and characteristics. The results demonstrate that the median absolute percentage error of the new OPM version decreased from 130% to 59% for outage predictions at the service territory level, and the OPM skills for operational forecasts are consistent with the skills based on historical storm analyses.","IEEE","","National Renewable Energy Lab.

In order to try to integrate a very large share of variable renewable energy sources into the energy system, an integrated energy planning approach was used, including ice storage in the cooling sector, a smart charging option in the transport sector, and an excess capacity of reverse osmosis technology that was utilised in order to provide flexibility to the energy system. A unit commitment and economic dispatch tool (PLEXOS) was used, and the model was run with both 5 min and 1 h time resolutions. The case study was carried out for a typical Caribbean island nation, based on data derived from measured data from Aruba. The results showed that 78.1% of the final electricity demand in 2020 was met by variable renewable energy sources, having 1.0% of curtailed energy in the energy system. The total economic cost of the modelled energy system was similar to the current energy system, dominated by the fossil fuel imports. Here, the results are relevant for many populated islands and island nations.</p>","MDPI AG","","National Renewable Energy Lab.

With the increasing number of electrical vehicles and charging/discharging stations, two systems are become tightly coupled. However, to optimize the two systems target using electrical vehicles as decision control variables cannot be easily solved using a uniformed optimization frame work. Thus we propose a hierarchical optimization approach to address this problem, which consists of a higher and a lower level. In the higher level, the power distribution system and urban transportation system are treated together to minimize the social cost. Meanwhile, the electrical vehicles and the charging/discharging stations are treated as customers to minimize their own expenditures. Then, an equilibrium is designed to determine the optimal charging/discharging price. In the lower level, the models of power distribution system and urban transportation system are developed to provide a detailed analysis. Specifically, in power distribution system, the three-phase unbalanced optimal power flow problem is relaxed with the semidefinite relaxation programming, and solved with alternating direction method of multiplier. A dynamic user equilibrium problem is formulated for the urban transportation system. For electrical vehicles, the state of charge is considered to optimize the charging/discharging schedule and reduce the impacts of power distribution systems. We conducted the simulation and numerical analysis using the IEEE 8500-bus distribution system and the Sioux Falls system with about 10,000 cars. The results demonstrate the feasibility and effectiveness of the proposed approach.","Elsevier","","National Renewable Energy Lab.

Time-domain simulation based assessment of the system robustness against uncertain and stochastic disturbances is extremely time-consuming. In this paper, we develop an alternative approach, which has its roots in the input-output stability analysis for Lur'e systems. Our approach consists of a mathematically rigorous characterization of the external disturbances that the power system is transiently stable and the frequency constraints are not violated. As a result, the derived certificate is efficiently constructed via convex optimization and is shown to be non-conservative for different IEEE test cases.","IEEE","","Pacific Northwest National Lab.

"A generative graph model for electrical infrastructure networks","Aksoy, Sinan G.; Purvine, Emilie AH; Cotilla Sanchez, Eduardo; Halappanavar, Mahantesh","24 POWER TRANSMISSION AND DISTRIBUTION; power grid graph model; Chung-Lu model; network-of-networks","We propose a generative graph model for electrical infrastructure networks that accounts for heterogeneity in both node and edge type. To inform the design of this model, we analyze the properties of power grid graphs derived from the U.S. Eastern Interconnection, Texas Interconnection, and Poland transmission system power grids. Across these datasets, we find subgraphs induced by nodes of the same voltage level exhibit shared structural properties atypical to small-world networks, including low local clustering, large diameter and large average distance. On the other hand, we find subgraphs induced by transformer edges linking nodes of different voltage types contain a more limited structure, consisting mainly of small, disjoint star graphs. The goal of our proposed model is to match both these inter and intra-network properties by proceeding in two phases: we first generate subgraphs for each voltage level and then generate transformer edges that connect these subgraphs. The first phase of the model adapts the Chung-Lu random graph model, taking desired vertex degrees and desired diameter as inputs, while the second phase of the model is based on a simpler random star graph generation process. We test the performance of our model by comparing its output across many runs to the aforementioned real data. In nearly all categories tested, we find our model is more accurate in reproducing the unusual mixture of properties apparent in the data than the Chung-Lu model. We also include graph visualization comparisons, as well as a brief analysis of edge-deletion resiliency. Ultimately, our model may be used to generate synthetic graph data, test hypotheses and algorithms at different scales, and serve as a baseline model on top of which further electrical network properties, device models, and interdependencies to other networks, may be appended.","Oxford University Press","","Pacific Northwest National Lab.

"A generic microgrid controller: Concept, testing, and insights","Razeghi, Ghazal; Gu, Fei; Neal, Russell; Samuelsen, Scott","24 POWER TRANSMISSION AND DISTRIBUTION","Microgrids have garnered attention in recent years as a way to increase the reliability of the grid, increase the reliability of electricity service to customers, adapt to an increasing percentage of intermittent renewable generation, and serve both customer critical loads and the needs of adjacent communities in the case of emergencies such as natural disasters. One barrier to microgrids is the historic cost and lack of standardization associated with microgrid controllers. To reduce this cost and address standardization, specifications for a Generic Microgrid Controller (GMC) were developed with the goal to facilitate the design and ease of adaptation of microgrid controllers to various microgrids of different sizes and with different resources. A GMC must address two core functions, Transition and Dispatch, as well as several optional higher level functions such as economic dispatch, and renewable and load forecasting. The GMC specifications were demonstrated and evaluated using a commercial simulation platform for two different microgrids, a 20MW-Class community microgrid and a 10MW-Class medical center microgrid. For each microgrid, the GMC was tested in hardware-in-the-loop (HIL) using an OPAL-RT real-time digital simulator, and the two core functions were assessed. The results established that (1) the GMC is successful in seamlessly transitioning the microgrids to and from an islanded mode, (2) a load/generation mismatch at the time of separation depends on the microgrid configuration and must be lower than a specific value determined by simulation testing, and (3) the GMC Dispatch Function response is acceptable in maintaining, in the islanded mode, 60Hz for a range of load changes.","Elsevier","","Univ. of California, Irvine, CA (United States)","USDOE Office of Electricity (OE)","","United States","2018-08-13T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: Applied Energy; Journal Volume: 229; Journal Issue: C","","Medium: ED; Size: p. 660-671","","","OE0000730","Journal ID: ISSN 0306-2619; PII: S0306261918311693","10.1016/j.apenergy.2018.08.014","","2021-07-27T00:00:00Z","1464787","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/1464787","https://www.osti.gov/servlets/purl/1464787","Applied Energy","C","229"

Here, these data are aggregated to compute publicly reported metrics describing high-level characteristics of grid performance. The current work explores the depth of insights that can be gained from public data, and the implications of losing visibility into heterogeneity in grid performance through aggregation. We present an exploratory analysis examining three years of high-resolution power interruption data collected by archiving information posted in real-time on the public-facing website of a utility in the Western United States. We report on the size, frequency and duration of individual power interruptions, and on spatio-temporal variability in aggregate reliability metrics. Our results show that metrics of grid performance can vary spatially and temporally by orders of magnitude, revealing heterogeneity that is not evidenced in publicly reported metrics. We show that limited access to granular information presents a substantive barrier to conducting detailed policy analysis, and discuss how more widespread data access could help to answer questions that remain unanswered in the literature to date. Lastly, given open questions about whether grid performance is adequate to support societal needs, we recommend establishing pathways to make high-resolution power interruption data available to support policy research.","Elsevier","","Lawrence Berkeley National Lab.

We additionally compare the performance of relaxations of the ACOPF problem, including the rectangular form without reference bus constraints, the rectangular form with reference bus constraints, and the polar form. We find that relaxations of the rectangular form significantly strengthen existing relaxations if reference bus constraints are included. Overall, relaxations of the polar form perform the best. However, neither the rectangular nor the polar form dominates the other. Ultimately, with these strategies, we are able to reduce the optimality gap to less than 0.1% on all but 5 NESTA test cases with up to 300 buses by performing OBBT alone.","IEEE","","Sandia National Lab.

This converter has the inductor placed at the input with a smaller voltage swing, leading to possible use of a smaller inductor and low-voltage rating switches that generally translate to reduced conduction losses. Analyses of converter operation and losses to reveal its original characteristics and design guidelines are presented to facilitate the components optimization. The converter architecture is verified by a proof-of-concept 15-W inductor-less lithium-ion battery charger prototype that uses a 1-m USB 3.0 cable as inductor. The converter, switched at 2 MHz from a 5-V input, experimentally achieves 89.7% peak efficiency and 6% higher efficiency at full load than a Buck converter counterpart. This high efficiency and zero onboard inductor yield a relative 45.7% onboard loss reduction at full load, promising excellent integration feasibility and superior system thermal management.","IEEE","","National Renewable Energy Lab.

"Statistical Bus Ranking for Flexible Robust Unit Commitment","Gupta, Amandeep; Anderson, C.

This paper presents a statistical ranking methodology that allows adaptive robust stochastic unit commitment using a modular structure, with much-needed flexibility. Specifically, this paper describes a bus ranking methodology that identifies the most critical buses based on a worst-case metric. An important innovation is the ability to identify alternative metrics on which to rank the uncertainty set-for example, to minimize economic dispatch cost or ramping needs, to provide a customized robust unit commitment solution. Compared to traditional robust unit commitment models, the proposed model combines statistical tools with analytical framework of power system networks. The resulting formulation is easily implementable and customizable to the needs of the system operator. The method and its applications are validated against other established approaches, showing equivalent solution to the state-of-the-art approach. Case studies were conducted on the IEEE-30, IEEE-118, and the pegase-1354 networks. In addition, the flexibility of bus ranking formulation is illustrated through implementation of alternative definitions of worst-case metrics. Results show that the bus ranking method performs as well as the best of these methods, with the provision of additional flexibility and potential for parallelization.","IEEE","","Cornell Univ., Ithaca, NY (United States)","USDOE Office of Electricity (OE); National Science Foundation (NSF)","","United States","2018-08-07T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: IEEE Transactions on Power Systems; Journal Volume: 34; Journal Issue: 1","","Medium: ED; Size: p. 236-245","","TPWRS-01722-2017","OE0000843; EPAS-1453615","Journal ID: ISSN 0885-8950; EPAS-1453615","10.1109/tpwrs.2018.2864131","","2022-07-20T00:00:00Z","1871547","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/1871547","https://www.osti.gov/servlets/purl/1871547","IEEE Transactions on Power Systems","1","34"

The challenge however is to transform the large amount of data that is generated by micro-PMUs to actionable information and then match the information to use cases with practical value to system operators. This open problem is addressed in this paper. First, we introduce a novel data-driven event detection technique to pick out valuable portion of data from extremely large raw micro-PMU data. Subsequently, a datadriven event classifier is developed to effectively classify power quality events. Importantly, we use field expert knowledge and utility records to conduct an extensive data-driven event labeling. Moreover, certain aspects from event detection analysis are adopted as additional features to be fed into the classifier model. In this regard, a multi-class support vector machine (multi-SVM) classifier is trained and tested over 15 days of real-world data from two micro-PMUs on a distribution feeder in Riverside, CA. In total, we analyze 1.2 billion measurement points, and 10,700 events. Here, the effectiveness of the developed event classifier is compared with prevalent multi-class classification methods, including k-nearest neighbor method as well as decision-tree method.

This paper introduces and tests a potential market structure that includes a short-term reserve market for renewable resources where the realized energy is drawn within the bounds of the hourly capacity offered. The study presents a risk-aware stochastic model that determines, based on the day-ahead offer derived using a classic newsvendor formula, the best intraday offers for a renewable energy power plant. The stochastic approach takes into account the uncertainties of energy production and market prices. The proposed risk-sensitive model aims to maximize the renewable power plant's revenues and minimize potential risks of loss in a multi-product multi-timescale market setup. To demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed formulation, we study the case of a hypothetical 750-kW wave power plant coupled with energy storage. The study shows that the risk of profit loss is not uniformly distributed across the risk-aversion factor space. We also find that the introduction of the short-term reserve market results in a wider range of conditional value at risk while inducing 5% profit increase and a lower profit reduction across the risk range. In addition, the study reveals that the short-term reserve market is profitable for both the system operator and the wave energy power plant considered.","Elsevier","","National Renewable Energy Lab.

In contrast to the celebrated Kuramoto model, we do not work in polar coordinates and do not consider oscillations of fixed magnitude. We propose a synchronizing feedback based on relative state information and local measurements that induces consensus-like dynamics. We show that, under a mild stability condition, the combination of the synchronizing feedback with a decentralized magnitude control law renders the oscillators' almost globally asymptotically stable with respect to set points for the phase shift, frequency, and magnitude. We apply these result to rigorously solve an open problem in control of inverter-based ac power systems. In this context, the proposed control strategy can be implemented using purely local information, induces a grid-forming behavior, and ensures that a network of ac power inverters is almost globally asymptotically stable with respect to a prespecified solution of the ac power-flow equations. Moreover, we show that the controller exhibits a droop-like behavior around the standard operating point, thus, making it backward compatible with the existing power system operation.","","","National Renewable Energy Lab.

The goal of the formulation is to minimize the cost of inverter installation, average power import, and average distributed generation curtailment. Threephase and single-phase inverter models are presented that preserve the underlying mappings between renewable uncertainty to power injection. The uncertainty of distributed generators (DGs) and loads are characterized by a finite set of scenarios. Linear multi-phase power flow approximations are used in conjunction with scenario reduction techniques to arrive at a tractable twostage stochastic formulation for optimal DG placement and sizing. First-stage decisions are locations for DG deployment and capacity sizes, and second-stage decisions include DG real power curtailment, reactive power support, as well as feeder voltage profile. The resulting formulation is a mixed-integer second-order cone program and can be solved efficiently either by existing optimization solvers or by relaxing the binary variables to the [0,1] interval. Simulation studies on standard multi-phase IEEE test feeders promise that optimal stochastic planning of DGs reduces costs during validation, compared to a scheme where uncertainty is only represented by its average value.","IEEE","","National Renewable Energy Lab.

"Decentralized wind uncertainty management: Alternating direction method of multipliers based distributionally-robust chance constrained optimal power flow","Fang, Xin; Hodge, Bri-Mathias; Jiang, Huaiguang; Zhang, Yingchen","17 WIND ENERGY; 24 POWER TRANSMISSION AND DISTRIBUTION; economic dispatch; correlation; wind power uncertainty; alternating direction method of multiplier; ADMM; distributionally robust chance constrained optimal power flow; DRCC-OPF","How to manage wind power uncertainty in system operation is an urgent and important issue, especially under substantially increasing penetration levels of wind generation in electric power systems. With increasing numbers of wind power plants (WPPs) integrated into power systems, their variability and uncertain power outputs become a challenge to maintaining system reliability. Traditional stochastic optimization-based models face the curse of dimensionality when the number of WPPs increases. This paper proposes a novel decentralized wind power uncertainty management model. In this model, conventional generators optimize their power capacity output and their participation to mitigate wind power uncertainty locally with only limited information exchange with the system operators. First, a distributionally-robust chance-constrained optimal power flow (DRCC-OPF) model is deployed to schedule the generation and reserve considering the wind power forecast uncertainty. Then, the alternating direction method of multipliers (ADMM) is used to reformulate the DRCC-OPF model into the distributed optimization model for each conventional generator and WPP. The tests on a small PJM 5-bus system and the IEEE 118-bus system demonstrate that the proposed decentralized model can increase the operation reliability without sacrificing system operating cost, especially when the wind power penetration levels are high. Using the proposed model, the optimal solutions can be obtained within one minute, for all studied cases, which verifies the computation efficiency of the proposed decentralized model. Furthermore, considering a large number of WPPs integrated into the system, the proposed decentralized method obtains a lower operating cost within one minute which demonstrates its efficiency to deal with high dimension of uncertainties.","Elsevier","","National Renewable Energy Lab.

The HRRR model can provide accurate 18- hour forecasts with a 15-minute temporal resolution. Typical static ratings used for over head transmission lines use overly conservative assumptions for local weather conditions, such as using the maximum solar irradiance or temperature measured during the summer combined with low wind speed for an entire season. The HRRR forecast model used here has a high spatial resolution to provide local forecast conditions along the entire length of a transmission line. The area that is of interest in this study is in southern Idaho spanning a total of 15,000 square kilometers. The forecasted weather data is coupled with a computational fluid dynamics model of the wind in the region to improve the resolution to an even finer scale for resolving local convective cooling rates on each individual transmission line midpoint span. This high fidelity approach can be used to find the minimum ampacity limit across all given midpoints of a transmission line to determine the absolute minimum to be used for the line rating. The ability to increase the line rating above the conservative static approach with the forecasted weather data provides a large potential to alleviate congestion and provide data for the utility market transactions. Furthermore, this study shows that for the region of interest, using forecasted weather data coupled with CFD modeling will calculate DLR ampacity rating above static about 90% of the time, with only a small relative error in the forecasted ampacity over time.","Elsevier","","Idaho National Lab.

DoS can be a frequent threat to DC microgrids with advanced controllers that hinge on active information exchanges: it can paralyze data communications and cause control ineptness or even system instability. Furthermore, we show that temporal DoS incidents render the DC microgrid cyber-physical topology and parameters time-varying and cause them to jump between faulty conditions. As existing DC microgrid stability analysis results are primarily developed from time-invariant systems, they might not be valid for the DoS interrupted systems. In this paper, we seek to study whether a DC microgrid is resilient against time-varying unknown DoS incidents. The problem is formulated as a stability analysis problem for a system with randomly switching dynamics. Scalable conditions are developed to provide provable resilience guarantees. In addition, we exploit the special structure of the conditions to yield quantified resilience measure by convex optimization techniques. As a result, the measure can be used for the evaluation of the resilience of different DC microgrid design against DoS incidents. We demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed work using simulation case studies.","IEEE","","Argonne National Lab.

This work develops a learning framework to reconstruct the radial operational structure of the distribution grid from synchronized voltage measurements. To detect operational lines our learning algorithm uses conditional independence tests for continuous random variables that is applicable to a wide class of probability distributions and Gaussian injections in particular.

First, a multimodel machine learning-based ensemble deterministic forecasting framework is adopted to generate deterministic forecasts. The deterministic forecast is assumed to be the mean value of the predictive distribution at each forecasting time stamp. Then, the optimal unknown parameter (i.e., standard deviation) of the predictive distribution is estimated by a support vector regression surrogate model based on the deterministic forecasts. Lastly, probabilistic forecasts are generated from the predictive distribution.

"Decentralized Voltage and Power Control of Multi-Machine Power Systems With Global Asymptotic Stability","Liu, Hui; Su, Jinshuo; Qi, Junjian; Wang, Ni; Li, Canbing","24 POWER TRANSMISSION AND DISTRIBUTION","Maintaining power system stability is becoming urgent due to the large-scale interconnection of power grids and the high penetration of uncertain renewable energy sources. The excitation control and governor control of synchronous generators have been considered as two crucial measures for enhancing the power system stability. However, a major challenge is to simultaneously achieve global asymptotic stability (GAS), voltage regulation (VR), and power regulation (PR) in the excitation and governor control. In this paper, a Lyapunov-based decentralized control (LBC) is proposed to address this challenge. The time-derivative of the Lyapunov function is designed by the feedback control of synchronous generators in order to guarantee GAS. VR and PR are ensured by considering voltage and power deviations as the feedback variables. The simulation results on the New-England ten-machine power system validate the effectiveness of the proposed LBC in improving power system transient stability and simultaneously achieving VR and PR. Although the proportional-integral- and power system stabilizer-based control can also perform VR and PR, the proposed control has much better dynamic performance and can more significantly improve the system transient stability.","IEEE","","Univ. of Central Florida, Orlando, FL (United States)","USDOE Office of Energy Efficiency and Renewable Energy (EERE); National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC)","","United States","2019-01-21T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: IEEE Access; Journal Volume: 7","","Medium: ED; Size: p. 14273-14282","","","EE0007327","Journal ID: ISSN 2169-3536","10.1109/ACCESS.2019.2893409","","2020-01-24T00:00:00Z","1592009","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/1592009","https://www.osti.gov/servlets/purl/1592009","IEEE Access","","7"

In this paper we present a scalable decomposition algorithm, based on the integer L-shaped method, for solving this problem for realistic power systems. The algorithm works by partitioning the problem into a master problem and a slave problem. The master problem optimizes over energization sequences of generators, buses and branches, for the entire restoration horizon, while respecting stylized energization requirements. The slave problem verifies that there exist power flow solutions supporting the energization sequences proposed by the master problem, adding cuts to the master if an infeasible sequence is detected. The power flow verification is carried out using a piece-wise linear approximation of the power flow equations, capable of capturing overvoltage situations common in restoration procedures. We develop specialized binary cuts and hybrid Benders-binary cuts for separating infeasible islands, which are stronger than regular no-good cuts, as well as heuristics for obtaining feasible solutions. We present numerical results for the IEEE 39- and 118-bus systems, and for the Chilean 1500-bus grid, where our algorithm finds near-optimal restoration sequences orders of magnitude faster than the state-of-the-art, demonstrating the effectiveness of the proposed approach.","See Research Organization","External Audience (Unlimited)","Lawrence Livermore National Lab.

"A phase model approach for thermostatically controlled load demand response","Bomela, Walter Botongo; Zlotnik, Anatoly V.; Li, Jr -Shin","24 POWER TRANSMISSION AND DISTRIBUTION; Energy Sciences; Mathematics; demand response; ancillary services; renewable energy; phase model","A significant portion of electricity consumed worldwide is used to power thermostatically controlled loads (TCLs) such as air conditioners, refrigerators, and water heaters. Because the short-term timing of operation of such systems is inconsequential as long as their long-run average power consumption is maintained, they are increasingly used in demand response (DR) programs to balance supply and demand on the power grid. Here, we present an ab initio phase model for general TCLs, and use the concept to develop a continuous oscillator model of a TCL and compute its phase response to changes in temperature and applied power. This yields a simple control system model that can be used to evaluate control policies for modulating the power consumption of aggregated loads with parameter heterogeneity and stochastic drift. We demonstrate this concept by comparing simulations of ensembles of heterogeneous loads using the continuous state model and an established hybrid state model. The developed phase model approach is a novel means of evaluating DR provision using TCLs, and is instrumental in estimating the capacity of ancillary services or DR on different time scales. We further propose a novel phase response based open-loop control policy that effectively modulates the aggregate power of a heterogeneous TCL population while maintaining load diversity and minimizing power overshoots. This is demonstrated by low-error tracking of a regulation signal by filtering it into frequency bands and using TCL sub-ensembles with duty cycles in corresponding ranges. As a result, control policies that can maintain a uniform distribution of power consumption by aggregated heterogeneous loads will enable distribution system management (DSM) approaches that maintain stability as well as power quality, and further allow more integration of renewable energy sources.","Elsevier","","Los Alamos National Lab.

We examine barriers and opportunities associated with these most difficult-to-decarbonize services, including possible technological solutions and research and development priorities. A range of existing technologies could meet future demands for these services without net addition of CO2 to the atmosphere, but these options are expensive in comparison to current costs of services.

Specifically, the source authentication is performed when the measurements are subjected to three types of spoofing attacks. Some practical difficulties in applying the proposed method on real-time authentication caused by insufficient measurement data have also been solved.

"Distributed Load Restoration in Unbalanced Active Distribution Systems","Roofegari Nejad, Reza; Sun, Wei","24 POWER TRANSMISSION AND DISTRIBUTION; 14 SOLAR ENERGY; Alternating direction method of multipliers (ADMM); bidirectional unbalanced power flow; convex quadratic programming; distributed energy resources; load restoration","We present that the resilience of modern power systems has been constantly threatened by various natural disasters and manmade attacks. Under those threats, fast and automatic restoration actions are critical for restoring impacted systems to normal operating conditions and preventing from additional disastrous consequences. Smart grid technologies, such as distributed energy resources (DERs) and microgrids, provide both opportunities and challenges for distribution system restoration. In this paper, distributed load restoration (DLR), in unbalanced active distribution networks is developed using the alternating direction method of multipliers (ADMM) algorithm. The step-by-step restoration actions are provided to schedule the output of DERs and distribution system control devices, as well as the power consumption from transmission system restoration. The nonlinearities from three-phase unbalanced power flow and distribution components modeling are relaxed into a convex quadratic programming model. Then, the problem is decomposed into subproblems for each node by applying ADMM-DLR; and solves through each agent by exchanging limited information with neighboring nodes in an iterative procedure. The developed models and algorithms are validated and demonstrated through testing of the IEEE 13-node and 123-node test feeders. Lastly, simulation results demonstrate the effectiveness of restoring unbalanced distribution system with the hybrid bottom-up and top-down restoration strategies.","IEEE","","Univ. of Central Florida, Orlando, FL (United States)","USDOE Office of Energy Efficiency and Renewable Energy (EERE)","","United States","2019-01-08T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: IEEE Transactions on Smart Grid; Journal Volume: 10; Journal Issue: 5","","Medium: ED; Size: p. 5759-5769","","","EE0007327; EE0007998","Journal ID: ISSN 1949-3053","10.1109/TSG.2019.2891419","","2021-09-16T00:00:00Z","1601125","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/1601125","https://www.osti.gov/servlets/purl/1601125","IEEE Transactions on Smart Grid","5","10"

"An Equivalent Time-Variant Storage Model to Harness EV Flexibility: Forecast and Aggregation","Pertl, Michael; Carducci, Francesco; Tabone, Michaelangelo; Marinelli, Mattia; Kiliccote, Sila; Kara, Emre C.","24 POWER TRANSMISSION AND DISTRIBUTION; Aggregation; data analysis; demand response (DR); electric vehicles (EVs); power system flexibility","The demand for vehicle charging will necessitate large investments in power distribution, transmission, and generation. However, this demand is often also flexible in time, and can be actively managed to reduce the needed investments, and to better integrate renewable electricity. Harnessing this flexibility requires forecasting and controlling electric vehicle (EV) charging at thousands of stations. In this work, we address the problem of forecasting and management of the aggregate flexible demand from tens to thousands of EV supply equipment (EVSEs). First, it presents an equivalent time-variant storage model for flexible demand at an aggregation of EVSEs. The proposed model is generalizable to different markets, and also to different flexible loads. Model parameters representing multiple EVSEs can be easily aggregated by summation, and forecasted using autoregressive models. The forecastability of uncontrolled demand and storage parameters is evaluated using data from 1341 nonresidential EVSEs located in Northern California. The median coefficient of variation is as low as 24% for the forecast of uncontrolled demand at the highest aggregation and 10-15% for the storage parameters. The benefits of aggregation and forecastability are demonstrated using an energy arbitrage scenario. Purchasing energy day ahead is less expensive than in the real-time market, but relies on a uncertain forecast of charging availability. The results show that the forecastability significantly improves for larger aggregations. This helps the aggregator make a better forecast, and decreases the cost of charging in comparison to an uncontrolled case by 60% with respect to an oracle scenario.","IEEE","","SLAC National Accelerator Lab., Menlo Park, CA (United States)","USDOE","","United States","2018-08-16T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: IEEE Transactions on Industrial Informatics; Journal Volume: 15; Journal Issue: 4","","Medium: ED; Size: p. 1899-1910","","","0000-1756; AC02-76SF00515; 609687","Journal ID: ISSN 1551-3203","10.1109/tii.2018.2865433","","2021-07-30T00:00:00Z","1529174","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/1529174","https://www.osti.gov/servlets/purl/1529174","IEEE Transactions on Industrial Informatics","4","15"

This paper proposes a framework for exact optimal active and reactive power dispatch of distributed photovoltaic (PV) generation, switched capacitors, and tap changers in large multi-phase unbalanced distribution systems. The objectives of the optimal dispatch are minimization of the energy loss, PV active power curtailment, and capacitor and tap changer switching operations, in addition to elimination of voltage violations and reverse power flow. The optimization problem is formulated in rectangular coordinates as a nonlinear, nonconvex problem. Effective computational strategies are proposed to allow the application of predictorcorrector primal-dual interior point method to solve optimization problems in real-time with a large number of constraints and variables, including discrete variables corresponding to switched capacitors and tap changers. The accuracy of the numerical solution and the ability to implement the proposed framework are validated using the unbalanced multi-phase IEEE 34-bus and EPRI 2,998-bus distribution systems with 15-minute load and PV data.

"Chance Constraints for Improving the Security of AC Optimal Power Flow","Lubin, M.; Dvorkin, Y.; Roald, L.","24 POWER TRANSMISSION AND DISTRIBUTION; Mathematical model; Uncertainty; Generators; Reactive power; Production; Load flow; Voltage control","This paper introduces a scalable method for improving the solutions of ac optimal power flow (AC OPF) with respect to deviations in predicted power injections from wind and other uncertain generation resources. The aim of this paper is on providing solutions that are more robust to short-term deviations, and that optimize both the initial operating point and a parametrized response policy for control during fluctuations. We formulate this as a chance-constrained optimization problem. To obtain a tractable representation of the chance constraints, we introduce a number of modeling assumptions and leverage recent theoretical results to reformulate the problem as a convex, second-order cone program, which is efficiently solvable even for large instances. Our experiments demonstrate that the proposed procedure improves the feasibility and cost performance of the OPF solution, while the additional computation time is on the same magnitude as a single deterministic AC OPF calculation.","IEEE","","Los Alamos National Lab.

This is pivotal in assessing the capability of the power system to accommodate net load variability and its impacts on the grid such as voltage rise, narrowing peak demand duration, and reducing the cost of energy storage. Although the extant literature has focused on load clustering, this paper uses a symbolic aggregate approximation-based (SAX-based) dimensionality- reduction and k-means techniques to cluster net consumption of smart meter data for more than 3500 residential customers in a month at different temporal resolutions. This study proposes the use of cumulative explained variance in the principal component analysis to determine the optimal number of segments and dimensionality of the transformed space during discretization while retaining the data integrity instead of using intuition, as proposed by the extant literature. Also, this paper describes a screening methodology to determine the distribution of high-voltage customers among the resulting clusters of customers with and without on-site solar photovoltaic generation at different time resolutions.","Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers","","National Renewable Energy Lab.

By regulating the operation of SOPs, the strategy can reduce power losses and simultaneously mitigate the three-phase unbalance of the upper-level grid.

Energy systems have evolved from individual systems with little or no dependencies into a complex set of integrated systems at scales that include customers, cities, and regions. This evolution has been driven by political, economic, and environmental objectives. As we try to meet the globally recognized imperative to reduce carbon emissions through the deployment of large renewable energy capacities while also maintaining reliability and competitiveness, flexible energy systems are required. This flexibility can be attained through integrating various systems: by physically linking energy vectors, namely electricity, heat, and fuels; by coordinating these vectors across other infrastructures, namely water, data, and transport; by institutionally coordinating energy markets; and, spatially, by increasing market footprint with granularity all the way down to the customer level. Smart grids and ESI are related, in particular, the coupling between electricity, consumers, data and transport. This special section focuses on the aspects of ESI where electricity is coupled to water, heat and fuels and where this coupling brings challenges and/or opportunities.","IEEE","","National Renewable Energy Lab.

This development suggests the need for closer communication and coordination between gas and power transmission system operators in order to improve the efficiency and reliability of the combined energy system. In this paper, we present a co-simulation platform for examining the interdependence between natural gas and electricity transmission networks based on a direct current unit-commitment and economic dispatch model for the power system and a transient hydraulic gas model for the gas system. We analyze the value of day-ahead coordination of power and natural gas network operations and show the importance of considering gas system constraints when analyzing power systems operation with high penetration of gas generators and renewable energy sources. Results show that day-ahead coordination contributes to a reduction in curtailed gas during high stress periods (e.g., large gas offtake ramps) and a reduction in energy consumption of gas compressor stations.","MDPI AG","","National Renewable Energy Lab.

"Integrating solar into Florida's power system: Potential roles for flexibility","Hale, Elaine T.; Stoll, Brady L.; Novacheck, Joshua E.","14 SOLAR ENERGY; 24 POWER TRANSMISSION AND DISTRIBUTION; renewable energy integration; solar photovoltaics; battery energy storage; demand response; operational flexibility","Although Florida has very little photovoltaic (PV) generation to date, it is reasonable to expect significant deployment in the 2020s under a variety of future policy and cost scenarios. To understand these potential futures, we model Florida Reliability Coordinating Council operations in 2026 over a wide range of PV penetrations with various combinations of battery storage capacity, demand response, and increased operational flexibility. By calculating the value of PV under a wide range of conditions, we find that at least 5%, and more likely 10-24%, PV penetration is cost competitive in Florida within the next decade with baseline flexibility and all but the most pessimistic of assumptions. For high PV penetrations, we demonstrate Florida's electrical net-load variability (duck curve) challenges, the associated reduction of PV's value to the system, and the ability of flexibility options-in particular energy-shifting resources-to preserve value and increase the economic carrying capacity of PV. A high level of demand response boosts the economic carrying capacity of PV by up to 0.5-2 percentage points, which is comparable to the impact of deploying 1 GW of battery storage. Adding 4 GW of battery storage expands the economic carrying capacity of PV by up to 6 percentage points.","Elsevier","","National Renewable Energy Lab.

"Toward a Synthetic Model for Distribution System Restoration and Crew Dispatch","Chen, Bo; Ye, Zhigang; Chen, Chen; Wang, Jianhui; Ding, Tao; Bie, Zhaohong","24 POWER TRANSMISSION AND DISTRIBUTION","Distribution service restoration (DSR) is critical for improving the resilience and reliability of modern distribution systems by strategically and sequentially energizing the system components and customer loads. Restoring electricity service to affected customers also requires multiple crews with different skill sets to perform multiple tasks that are procedurally interdependent with safety guaranteed. However, in existing DSR practices, switch operations and crew dispatch are scheduled separately, and their interdependence is not fully considered. As advanced technologies are enabling remote communication, control, and dispatch, utilities now desire an integrated DSR framework to achieve seamless coordination among multiple DSR tasks such as switch operation, crew dispatch, and component repair. In this paper, we introduce a synthetic model that integrates the service restoration model and the crew dispatch model based on a universal routing model. The proposed model can provide the estimated time of restoration for each load, the switching sequence for safely operating remotely/manually operated switches, and dispatch solutions for crews with different skill sets. The proposed synthetic model is formulated as a mixed-integer linear programming model, and its effectiveness is evaluated via the IEEE 123 bus test feeder and several large-scale test feeders (EPRI Ckt5, Ckt7, Ckt24, and IEEE 8500 node test feeder.","IEEE","","Argonne National Lab.

Recent works propose distribution level microgrid formation models using mixed-integer linear programming techniques.

In this article we introduce a heuristic approach that allows to approximately solve the post-disturbance microgrid formation problem for medium to large, more realistic, instances. Furthermore, the proposed approach allows to approximately solve the pre-disturbance microgrid formation problem (a stochastic version of the post-disturbance problem), in which the aim is to allocate extra generation capacity to the network to immunize it, as best as possible, against an uncertain cascading failure. Our results are illustrated by solving versions of the problem on ten test cases with up to 3012 buses.","IEEE","","National Renewable Energy Lab.

Anticipating continued reduction in the cost of electricity storage, we look into the potential opportunity in electrical power system where consumers share storage with each other. We consider two different scenarios. In the first scenario, consumers are assumed to already have individual storage devices and they explore cooperation to minimize the realized electricity consumption cost. In the second scenario, a group of consumers is interested to invest in joint storage capacity and operate it cooperatively. The resulting system problems are modeled using cooperative game theory. Finally, in both cases, the cooperative games are shown to have non-empty cores and we develop efficient cost allocations in the core with analytical expressions. Thus, sharing of storage in cooperative manner is shown to be very effective for the electric power system.","IEEE","","Lawrence Berkeley National Lab.

The chosen sensors are arrays of 50 Mu-m thin Low Gain Avalanche Detectors (LGAD). This paper presents results on single LGAD sensors with a surface area of 1.3x1.3 mm2 and arrays with 2x2 pads with a surface area of 2x2 mm2 or 3x3 mm2 each and different implant doses of the p+ multiplication layer. They are obtained from data collected during a beam test campaign in autumn 2016 with a pion beam of 120 GeV energy at the CERN SPS. In addition to several quantities measured inclusively for each pad, the gain, efficiency and time resolution have been estimated as a function of the position of the incident particle inside the pad by using a beam telescope with a position resolution of few Mu-m. Different methods to measure the time resolution are compared, yielding consistent results. The sensors with a surface area of 1.3x1.3 mm<sup>2</sup> have a time resolution of about 40 ps for a gain of 20 and of about 27 ps for a gain of 50 and fulfill the HGTD requirements. Larger sensors have, as expected, a degraded time resolution. All sensors show very good efficiency and time resolution uniformity.","Institute of Physics (IOP)","","Brookhaven National Lab.

Different approaches are briefly described, and general benefits and drawbacks presented based on recent experiences and available literature. The pace of micro-grid deployment has suffered from a lack of private sector investment, which is often inhibited by unfavorable policies and uncertainty around tariffs. Traditional utility tariffs are too low to allow micro-grid investors to recover their full costs, but a variety of new approaches can be applied to address these challenges. Broad consensus suggests that cost-reflective tariffs are a critical enabler for micro-grid scale-up. Such tariffs can be coupled with subsidies or with hybridized approaches as well as unique new methods of tapping alternative revenue streams to maintain affordability for low-income customers and financial sustainability for micro-grids. There is no one-size-fits-all approach so long as lifetime costs can be recouped.","Springer","","National Renewable Energy Lab.

We adopt and compare different types of turbine inertial control methods with the proposed modifications to cope with realistic wind conditions in the field. The simulation procedure is started with the software-based simulation, in which we employ the high-fidelity wind turbine simulator FAST that models a real three-bladed controls advanced research turbine (CART3). The advantages of using FAST are that it can provide convincing simulation results and address the interactions between turbine electrical and mechanical systems. The developed controller model is then rapidly prototyped for the real-time simulation with the hardware-in-the-loop scheme. CART3 will respond to a virtual frequency event triggered in the emulated electric grid modeled in a digital real-time simulator. The introduced simulation platform streamlines the procedure of designing turbine auxiliary controls, and these simulations results give insights on the turbine controls and their impacts on the interconnected power system, as well as the effects on turbine mechanical components. For example, the results indicate that the inertial controls tend to reduce the out-of-plane mechanical loadings in region 2, while such loadings are dominated by the pitch actions in region 3.","IEEE","","National Renewable Energy Lab.

This paper studies graph reduction methods of power grids that are favorable for fast simulations and follow-up applications. While the classical Kron reduction has been successful in reduced order modeling of power grids with traditional, hierarchical design, the selection of reference nodes for the reduced model in a multiscale, distribution and transmission, network becomes ambiguous. In this work we extend the use of the iterative Kron reduction by utilizing the electric grid's graph topology for the selection of reference nodes, consistent with the design features of multiscale networks. Additionally, we propose further reductions by aggregation of coherent subnetworks of triangular meshes, based on the graph topology and network characteristics, in order to preserve currents and build another power-flow equivalent network. Our reductions are achieved through the use of iterative aggregation of subgraphs that include general tree structures, lines, and triangles. Important features of our reduction algorithms include that (i) the reductions are either equivalent to the Kron reduction or otherwise produce a power-flow equivalent network; (ii) due to the mentioned power-flow equivalence, the reduced network can model the dynamic of the swing equations for a lossless, inductive, steady state network; (iii) the algorithms efficiently utilize hash tables to store the sequential reduction steps. The third feature allows for easy reintroduction of detailed models into the reduced, conceptual network and makes the final reduced order model backward compatible with a sequence of intermediate, partially reduced networks with varying resolution---the ordered sequence of iterative reductions corresponds to a sequence of reduced order models. The performance of our graph reduction algorithms and features of the reduced grids are discussed on a real-word transmission and distribution grid. We produce visualizations of the reduced models through open source libraries and release our reduction algorithms with example code and toy data.","SIAM","","Los Alamos National Lab.

"Strategic Offering for Wind Power Producers Considering Energy and Flexible Ramping Products","Fang, Xin; Krishnan, Venkat; Hodge, Bri-Mathias","17 WIND ENERGY; 24 POWER TRANSMISSION AND DISTRIBUTION; wind power; flexible ramping; strategic offers; electricity market; mathematical program with equilibrium constraints","The increasing deployments of renewable generation methods, such as wind, affects the flexibility of electric power system operating due to their inherent variability and uncertainty. To mitigate this, power systems need flexible resources. This paper investigates the potential for wind power to provide flexible ramping products in the real-time market, an additional value stream to the energy it provides. The proposed model for wind power’s strategic offering is formulated as a bi-level optimization problem with wind profit maximization at the upper level and the independent system operator’s economic dispatch—considering both the energy balance and the flexible ramping requirement to counter uncertainty—at the lower level. This bi-level model is converted to a mathematical program with equilibrium constraints (MPEC) by recasting the lower level problem with its Karush–Kuhn–Tucker optimality conditions. Then, through strong duality theory and the big-M method, the MPEC model is converted to a mixed-integer linear programming model. The opportunity cost and the price for wind power-providing ramping products are analyzed.

Industrial demand response (DR), has emerged as a strong candidate for mitigating demand variability. In this paper, we demonstrate the application of DR to an air separation unit (ASU), a chemical process that consumes significant amounts of electricity. We develop a novel optimal production scheduling framework that accounts for day-ahead electricity prices to modulate the grid load presented by the plant. Our framework accounts for the dynamics of the plant using a novel dynamic modeling framework. Further, we present a new decomposition scheme that allows us to solve the corresponding optimization problem in a matter of minutes.

"A Model Predictive Control Based Generator Start-Up Optimization Strategy for Restoration With Microgrids as Black-Start Resources","Zhao, Yuxuan; Lin, Zhenzhi; Ding, Yi; Liu, Yilu; Sun, Lei; Yan, Yong","24 POWER TRANSMISSION AND DISTRIBUTION","Microgrids (MGs) can operate in an islanded mode and serve as black-start resources for power system restoration (PSR). Here, a model predictive control (MPC) based generator start-up optimization strategy for PSR is proposed utilizing MGs as black-start resources. First, the generator start-up sequence (GSUS) optimization is formulated as a mixed integer linear programming. Then, the uncertainties of MG black-start resources (MBSRs) are modeled by discretizing the probability distribution of the forecast errors, and representative scenarios for MBSRs extracted by formulating the probability mass transportation problem. Third, the generator start-up optimization strategy considering MBSRs is proposed utilizing the MPC technique, in which the optimization objective is to maximize the energy capability of the power systems and minimize the load curtailment of the MGs in each looking-ahead interval. Simulations on the IEEE 118 bus system with MGs and Zhejiang provincial power system in China verify that the introduced strategy for PSR can successfully restore the power system and effectively determine the optimal GSUS.","IEEE","","Oak Ridge National Lab.

For each inverter, we place no restrictions on the converter topology and merely assume that the ac-side switch-averaged voltage can be controlled via pulsewidth modulation. The ac output of each inverter interfaces through an LCL filter to the grid. The closed-loop system contains a phase locked loop for grid synchronization, and real- and reactive-power control are realized with inner and outer PI current- and power-control loops. We derive a necessary and sufficient set of parametric relationships to ensure that a reduced-order aggregated state-space model for an arbitrary number of such paralleled inverters has the same model order and structure as any single inverter. We also present reduced-order models for the settings where the real- and reactive-power setpoints are different and where the inverters have different power ratings. We anticipate the proposed model being useful in analyzing the dynamics of large collections of parallel-connected inverters with minimal computational complexity. The aggregate model is validated against measurements obtained from a multi-inverter experimental setup consisting of three 750-VA paralleled grid-connected inverters, hence establishing robustness of the analytical result to parametric variations seen in practice.","","","National Renewable Energy Lab.

This paper studies the impact of cyber attacks on high voltage DC (HVDC) transmission oscillation damping control. Three kinds of cyber attack models are considered: timing attack , replay attack, and false data injection attack. The attacks are applied to the HVDC damping controller, which requires widearea measurements and long-distance communication. A modified IEEE New England 39-Bus AC-HVDC system is used as the test system. Simulation results have shown that all three kinds of attacks are capable of driving the AC-HVDC system into swing or unstable conditions.","MDPI AG","","Pacific Northwest National Lab.

"ARC algorithm: A novel approach to forecast and manage daily electrical maximum demand","Wu, Da-Chun; Amini, Amin; Razban, Ali; Chen, Jie","24 POWER TRANSMISSION AND DISTRIBUTION; Load forecast; Electrical maximum demand; Stochastic model; Peak shaving","This paper proposes an innovative algorithm for predicting short-term electrical maximum demand by using historical demand data. The ability to recognize in peak demand pattern for commercial or industrial customers would propose numerous direct and indirect benefits to the customers and utility providers in terms of demand reduction, cost control, and system stability. Prior works in electrical maximum demand forecasting have been mainly focused on seasonal effects, which is not a feasible approach for industrial manufacturing facilities in short-term load forecasting. The proposed algorithm, denoted as the Adaptive Rate of Change (ARC), determines the logarithmic rate-of-change in load profile prior to a peak by postulating the demand curve as a stochastic, mean-reverting process. The rationale behind this analysis, is that the energy efficient program requires not only demand estimation but also to warn the user of imminent maximum peak occurrence. This paper analyzes demand trend data and incorporates stochastic model and mean reverting half-life to develop an electrical maximum demand forecasting algorithm, which is statistically evaluated by cross-table and F-score for three different manufacturing facilities. Lastly, the aggregate results show an overall accuracy of 0.91 and a F-score of 0.43, which indicates that the algorithm is effective predicting peak demand in predicting peak demand.","Elsevier","","Indiana Univ., Indianapolis, IN (United States)","USDOE Office of Energy Efficiency and Renewable Energy (EERE), Energy Efficiency Office.

High levels of uncertainty means that it is not longer possible to guarantee operational feasibility with certainty, instead constraints are required to be satisfied with high probability. We present a chance-constrained economic dispatch model that efficiently integrates energy storage and high renewable penetration to satisfy renewable portfolio requirements. Specifically, it is required that wind energy contributes at least a prespecified ratio of the total demand and that the scheduled wind energy is dispatchable with high probability. We develop an approximated partial sample average approximation (PSAA) framework to enable efficient solution of large-scale chanceconstrained economic dispatch problems. Computational experiments on the IEEE-24 bus system show that the proposed PSAA approach is more accurate, closer to the prescribed tolerance, and about 100 times faster than sample average approximation. Improved efficiency of our PSAA approach enables solution of WECC-240 system in minutes.","Springer","","Sandia National Lab.

The model captures the uncertainty and variability of renewable generation and the flexibility limits of thermal plants.

The absolute value and standard deviation of area control errors (ACE), and the North American Electric Reliability Corporation Control Performance Standard 2 (CPS2) score are calculated through the multi-timescale scheduling simulation, including the day-ahead unit commitment (DU), real-time unit commitment (RU), real-time economic dispatch (RE), automatic generation control (AGC) sub-models. The absolute area control error in energy (AACEE), CPS2 violations, CPS2 score, and standard deviation of the raw ACE are all calculated and combined as the ESR metric. Numerical simulations show that the reliability benefits of multi-timescale power system operations are significantly increased due to the improved solar power forecasts.","IEEE","","National Renewable Energy Lab.

"Setting the Smart Solar Standard: Collaborations Between Hawaiian Electric and the National Renewable Energy Laboratory","Hoke, Andy; Giraldez, Julieta; Palmintier, Bryan; Ifuku, Earle; Asano, Marc; Ueda, Reid; Symko-Davies, Martha","14 SOLAR ENERGY; 24 POWER TRANSMISSION AND DISTRIBUTION; distributed generation; inverters; photovoltaic systems; quasti-static time-series simulation; power hardware-in-the-loop","Driving through many neighborhoods of Hawai'i, it is hard to miss the nearly ubiquitous rooftop solar photovoltaic (PV) systems that have popped up during the past eight years or so. Relatively high electricity costs associated with island grids, coupled with various incentives, have made it cost-effective to install solar over the last eight years, as evidenced by the PV-deployment chart in Figure 1. On the most populous island, O'ahu, the PV nameplate acgenerating capacity of 502 MW totals nearly half of the annual peak load for the entire island, which is 1.1 GW . Of that 502 MW of PVs, 54% is from private rooftop solar-nearly 50,000 residences or roughly one of every three single family homes. But Hawaiian Electric, the local utility, has no way to monitor or control the PV generation, even for most nonresidential systems. This means that on sunny days, up to approximately half of the PV generation is outside of the utility's control. This poses many challenges for utility planners and operators-challenges that Hawaiian Electric has been working diligently to address, along with various partners, notably the U.S. Department of Energy (DOE), the National Renewable Energy Laboratory (NREL), and its Energy System's Integration Facility (ESIF). This article describes how Hawaiian Electric has worked with engineers in NREL's Power Systems Engineering Center to improve the way its grid operates with very high levels of distributed PVs, largely by changing the way the PV inverters are operated.","IEEE","","National Renewable Energy Lab.

From the system perspective, their reliable and cost effective integration requires accounting for their physical properties in operating tools used by the DSO. This work describes an decomposable approach to leverage the dispatch flexibility of thermostatically controlled loads (TCLs) for operating distribution systems with a high penetration level of photovoltaic resources. Each TCL ensemble is modeled using the Markov Decision Process (MDP). The MDP model is then integrated with a chance constrained optimal power flow that accounts for the uncertainty of PV resources. Since the integrated optimization model cannot be solved efficiently by existing dynamic programming methods or off-the-shelf solvers, this paper proposes an iterative Spatio-Temporal Dual Decomposition algorithm (ST-D2). Finally, we demonstrate the merits of the proposed integrated optimization and ST-D2 algorithm on the IEEE 33-bus test system.","IEEE","","Los Alamos National Lab.

"The impact of planning reserve margins in long-term planning models of the electricity sector","Reimers, Andrew; Cole, Wesley; Frew, Bethany","24 POWER TRANSMISSION AND DISTRIBUTION; 29 ENERGY PLANNING, POLICY, AND ECONOMY; planning reserve margin; NERC; capacity expansion","The planning reserve margin is the predominant metric used in long-term planning models to ensure the resource adequacy of projected power systems. Considerable work has been done to estimate the contribution of variable renewable energy resources, such as wind and solar, to the planning reserve margin, but little work has been done to assess what planning reserve margin should be used in planning models. Typically, U.S.-based models use the North American Electric Reliability Corporation (NERC)-recommended reserve margin levels. However, historical reserve margins have often exceeded the NERC-recommended levels, suggesting that the use of NERC-recommended levels in planning models may negatively bias projected future capacity investments relative to real-world trends. Using the Regional Energy Deployment System capacity expansion model, we show that setting the planning reserve margin to observed levels in lieu of the NERC-recommended levels leads to substantial differences in near-term capacity additions. Scenarios using alternative specifications for the reserve margin resulted in increased national solar builds of 20-100 GW. Given that the magnitude on results from altering the reserve margin level is similar to or greater than many policies frequently analyzed with planning models, careful consideration of the reserve margin level is crucial for developing accurate power sector projections.","Elsevier","","National Renewable Energy Lab.

A centralized MIMO controller was preferred compared to a decentralized control approach because previous simulation studies showed that the coupling effect identified during the simultaneous control of the turbine speed and cathode airflow was better minimized. The MIMO controller was developed using a state-space dynamic model of the system that was derived using first-order transfer functions empirically obtained through experimental tests. The controller performance was evaluated in terms of disturbance rejection through perturbations in the gas turbine operation, and setpoint tracking maneuver through turbine speed and cathode airflow steps. The experimental results illustrate that a multicoordination control strategy was able to mitigate the coupling of each actuator to each output during the simultaneous control of the system, and improved the overall system performance during transient conditions. On the other hand, the controller showed different performance during validation in simulation environment compared to validation in the physical facility, which will require a better dynamic modeling of the system for the implementation of future multivariable control strategies.","ASME","","Ames Lab., Ames, IA (United States)","USDOE Office of Fossil Energy (FE)","","United States","2018-04-11T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: Journal of Electrochemical Energy Conversion and Storage; Journal Volume: 15; Journal Issue: 3","","Medium: ED; Size: Article No. 031007","","IS-J-9580","AC02-07CH11358","Journal ID: ISSN 2381-6872","10.1115/1.4039356","","2022-05-23T00:00:00Z","1433655","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/1433655","https://www.osti.gov/servlets/purl/1433655","Journal of Electrochemical Energy Conversion and Storage","3","15"

Historically, however, access to high quality geospatial energy data has been limited to few agencies because of commercial licenses restrictions, and those resources which are widely accessible have been of poor quality, particularly with respect to reliability. Recent efforts to develop a highly reliable and publicly accessible alternative to the existing datasets were met with numerous challenges – not the least of which was filling the gaps in power transmission line voltage ratings. To address the line voltage rating problem, we developed and tested a basic methodology that fuses knowledge and techniques from power systems, geography, and machine learning domains. Specifically, we identified predictors of nominal voltage that could be extracted from aerial imagery and developed a tree-based classifier to classify nominal line voltage ratings. Overall, we found that line support height, support span, and conductor spacing are the best predictors of voltage ratings, and that the classifier built with these predictors had a reliable predictive accuracy (that is, within one voltage class for four out of the five classes sampled). In conclusion, we applied our approach to a study area in Minnesota.","Taylor & Francis","","Oak Ridge National Lab.

Several such blocks, each containing a converter power stage and controls, are connected in series on their ac sides to obtain transformerless medium-voltage ac interfaces for PV power plants. The series-connected structure is made possible by a quadruple active bridge dc-dc converter that provides isolation between the PV input and each of the three ac-side phases within each block. Furthermore, since incoming PV power is transferred as constant balanced three-phase ac power, instantaneous inputoutput power balance bypasses the need for bulk energy storage. To streamline implementation and maximize system scalability and resilience, decentralized block-level controllers accomplish dc-link voltage regulation, maximum power point tracking, and ac-side power sharing without centralized means. The proposed architecture is validated by simulations of a PV string to mediumvoltage ac system consisting of six blocks and on a proof-of-concept hardware prototype that consists of three cascaded converter blocks.","IEEE","","National Renewable Energy Lab.

Hybrid simulation models are needed to capture the mixed communication technologies and IP address mechanisms in one simulation. To close this gap, we have developed a suite of hybrid communication system simulation models to validate the critical system design criteria for a distributed solar Photovoltaic (PV) communications system, including a single trip latency of 300 ms, throughput of 9.6 Kbps, and packet loss rate of 1%.

First, a framework and mathematical models of multi-energy residential systems (MERS) are proposed. Based on the characteristics of residential energy distribution networks, the complex MERS models are reformulated to relieve the computational burden. Furthermore, the uncertainty factors such as renewable energy generation fluctuations and demand variations are handled by a reformulated chance con-strained programming technique. The feasibility and effectiveness of the proposed method are validated through a combined electric power and natural gas test system.

Yet interannual variability significantly impacts the generation from one year to another of renewable power systems such as wind and PV. Consequently, the interannual variability of power generation corresponds to the interannual variability of capital returns on investment. The penetration of PV systems within the Hawaiian Electric Companies' portfolio has rapidly accelerated in recent years and is expected to continue to increase given the state's energy objectives laid out by the Hawaii Clean Energy Initiative. We use the National Solar Radiation Database (1998-2015) to characterize the interannual variability of the solar irradiance and meteorological conditions across the State of Hawaii. These data sets are passed to the National Renewable Energy Laboratory's System Advisory Model (SAM) to calculate an 18-year PV power generation data set to characterize the variability of PV power generation. We calculate the interannual coefficient of variability (COV) for annual average global horizontal irradiance (GHI) on the order of 2% and COV for annual capacity factor on the order of 3% across the Hawaiian archipelago. Regarding the interannual variability of seasonal trends, we calculate the COV for monthly average GHI values on the order of 5% and COV for monthly capacity factor on the order of 10%. We model residential-scale and utility-scale PV systems and calculate the economic returns of each system via the payback period and the net present value. We demonstrate that studies based on single-year data sets for economic evaluations reach conclusions that deviate from the true values realized by accounting for interannual variability.","Elsevier","","National Renewable Energy Lab.

In this paper, we propose an accurate and computational attractive approach for FDIA detection. In this work, we first rely on the low rank characteristic of the measurement matrix and the sparsity of the attack matrix to reformulate the FDIA detection as a matrix separation problem. Then, four algorithms that solve this problem are presented and compared, including the traditional augmented Lagrange multipliers (ALMs), double-noise-dual-problem (DNDP) ALM, the low rank matrix factorization, and the proposed new “Go Decomposition (GoDec).” Numerical simulation results show that our GoDec algorithm outperforms the other three alternatives and demonstrates a much higher computational efficiency. Furthermore, GoDec is shown to be able to handle measurement noise and applicable for large-scale attacks.","IEEE","External Audience (Unlimited)","Lawrence Livermore National Lab.

As important members in the power system, both generators and loads should take the responsibility of carbon reduction and thus carbon obligation is supposed to be allocated between both sides. Consequently, the carbon obligation allocation between the generation side and the demand side is proposed, and the problem is modeled as a cooperative game based cost allocation problem. The Aumann-Shapley method is used to solve the problem. The mechanism of allocating carbon obligation in both generation side and load side is compared with the allocation only on the generation side and the load side. The results of case study show that both generators and loads take the responsibility of emission reduction of the power system in the proposed mechanism, which can stimulate the energy saving and consumption reduction behavior of generators and loads and reduce the carbon emission of the power system.","State Grid Electric Power Research Institute Press","","National Renewable Energy Lab.

"Robust Operation of Soft Open Points in Active Distribution Networks with High Penetration of Photovoltaic Integration","Ji, Haoran; Wang, Chengshan; Li, Peng; Ding, Fei; Wu, Jianzhong","14 SOLAR ENERGY; 24 POWER TRANSMISSION AND DISTRIBUTION; active distribution network; photovoltaic generation; soft open point (SOP); uncertainty; robust optimization","Distributed generators (DGs) including photovoltaic panels (PVs) have been integrated dramatically in active distribution networks (ADNs). Due to the strong volatility and uncertainty, the high penetration of PV generation immensely exacerbates the conditions of voltage violation in ADNs. However, the emerging flexible interconnection technology based on soft open points (SOPs) provides increased controllability and flexibility to the system operation. For fully exploiting the regulation ability of SOPs to address the problems caused by PV, this paper proposes a robust optimization method to achieve the robust optimal operation of SOPs in ADNs. A two-stage adjustable robust optimization model is built to tackle the uncertainties of PV outputs, in which robust operation strategies of SOPs are generated to eliminate the voltage violations and reduce the power losses of ADNs. A column-and-constraint generation (C&CG) algorithm is developed to solve the proposed robust optimization model, which are formulated as second-order cone program (SOCP) to facilitate the accuracy and computation efficiency. Here, case studies on the modified IEEE 33-node system and comparisons with the deterministic optimization approach are conducted to verify the effectiveness and robustness of the proposed method.","IEEE","","National Renewable Energy Lab.

The var capacity provided by DG inverters is a potential solution for voltage regulation. The conventional centralized control strategies limited by computation and communication burdens are difficult to meet the requirement of rapid voltage control. However, the local control strategies based on real-time measurements have a fast response to the frequent fluctuations of DG outputs. The performance of these local controllers depends on the tuning of the control parameters. This paper proposes a centralized-based method to determine the local voltage control strategies for DGs. A centralized parameter tuning model of control curves is built, in which and curves of DG inverters are mathematically formulated based on piecewise linearization. The original mixed-integer nonlinear programming (MINLP) model is converted into an effectively solved mixed-integer second-order cone programming (MISOCP) model using convex relaxation. The potential benefits of DG inverters are explored to regulate both reactive and curtailed active power, based on local voltage measurements. Case studies on a modified PG&E 69-node distribution system are carried out to verify the effectiveness of the proposed method.

In the event of a sudden change in generation or load, the proposed scheme can restore the nominal frequency and the reference inter-area power flows, while minimizing the total cost of control for participating generators and loads. Power network stability under the proposed control is proved with a relatively realistic model which includes nonlinear power flow and a generic (potentially nonlinear or high-order) turbine-governor model, and further with first- and second-order turbine-governor models as special cases. Finally, in simulations, the proposed control scheme shows a comparable performance to the existing automatic generation control (AGC) when implemented only on the generator side, and demonstrates better dynamic characteristics than AGC when each scheme is implemented on both generators and controllable loads.

However, the potential value to the grid from managed charging has not been fully quantified. This paper adopts the tools used in the National Renewable Energy Laboratory's California Low Carbon Grid Study to quantify value to the grid from managed charging by using three levels of managed loads for 13 terawatt-hours of annual load from three million EVs in a 2030 California grid scenario. Simulation results show that management of the EV fleet's aggregate load from unmanaged to 100% managed results in savings between 210 million and 660 million annually in generation system costs, depending on grid conditions. The simulation results also suggest that targeted EV supply equipment (EVSE) deployments at workplaces and other mid-day parking locations will be needed to support managed charging in a high-renewables California and enable the identified value to the grid. Although the value of generation to the grid from managed EV load paired with high renewables seems substantial, we estimate that the installed cost of an EVSE must be between 1,000 and 3,000 for a 10-year life to be cost neutral, depending on grid conditions.","IEEE","","National Renewable Energy Lab.

Furthermore, the technical and economic characteristics of demand-side technologies could also complement the supply side by providing system services, such as adequacy and flexibility, which are increasingly required due to high variable renewable energy penetration. A capacity expansion methodology that captures the interactions between the supply and demand sides is developed to find cost-optimal and adequate investment portfolios. For the case study presented, the integrated energy system leverages the technical and economic complementarities of different supply and demand-side technologies. As a result, system integration using demand-side technologies improves the value proposition for decentralization given that the technologies can provide heat demand, while also meeting electricity demand and providing adequacy and flexibility.","IEEE","","National Renewable Energy Lab.

"Inversion Reduction Method for Real and Complex Distribution Feeder Models","Pecenak, Zachary K.; Disfani, Vahid R.; Reno, Matthew J.; Kleissl, Jan","24 POWER TRANSMISSION AND DISTRIBUTION; Distribution system; network reduction; mutual impedance; quasi static time-series simulations","We report the proliferation of distributed generation on distribution feeders triggers a large number of integration and planning studies. Further, the complexity of distribution feeder models, short simulation time steps, and long simulation horizons rapidly render studies computational burdensome. To mend this issue, we propose a methodology for reducing the number of nodes, loads, generators, line, and transformers of p-phase distribution feeders with unbalanced loads and generation, non-symmetric wire impedance, mutual coupling, shunt capacitance, and changes in voltage and phase. The methodology is derived on a constant power load assumption and employs a Gaussian elimination inversion technique to design the reduced feeder. Compared to previous work by the authors, the inversion reduction takes half the time and voltage errors after reduction are reduced by an order of magnitude. Using a snapshot simulation the reduction is tested on six additional publicly available feeders with a maximum voltage error 0.0075 p.u. regardless of feeder size or complexity, and typical errors on the order of 1 × 10 <sup>-4</sup> p.u. Lastly, for a day long quasi-static time series simulation on the UCSD A feeder, errors are shown to increase with changes in loading when a large number of buses removed, but shows less variation for less than 85% of buses removed.","IEEE","","Sandia National Lab.

"Integration of optimal operational dispatch and controller determined dynamics for microgrid survivability","Cattaneo, Alessandro; Madathil, Sreenath Chalil; Backhaus, Scott N.","24 POWER TRANSMISSION AND DISTRIBUTION; 32 ENERGY CONSERVATION, CONSUMPTION, AND UTILIZATION; Microgrids; Transients; Optimization; Operations; Control systems","We present that the reliability and resilience of the electrical power grids are essential to industry, economy and society. Microgrids that are able to island from the bulk electrical grid are one technology that may vastly improve electrical power service to customer loads. To achieve these improvements, an islanded microgrid should be able to operate through the loss of one of its generators without shedding electrical load. The loss of one generator will typically result in significant additional loads, including transient overloads, being placed on the remaining generators. There is also the possibility of additional generator tripping during these processes (i.e. cascading failures), which would likely result in the collapse of the microgrid. The novelty of our work consists in incorporating dynamic models of generator controllers into a microgrid optimal dispatch formulation with the ultimate goal to avoid operational failures and ensure the “survivability” of all-inverter microgrids to generator loss and transient overloads. The integration of generator and controller dynamics into the optimal dispatch formulation significantly increases the computational complexity. As we develop algorithms to restore speed of the optimization, our method can be readily implemented into a new operational strategy capable of an unprecedented level of reliability against generator contingencies. In addition, we quantitatively illustrate the effect of the survivability constraints on the microgrid operating costs and how the related trade-off between capital and operating costs should be taken into account at the design stage. Finally, the methods developed here also apply to the dispatch of off-grid microgrids.","Elsevier","","Los Alamos National Lab.

"Dynamic Power Distribution System Management With a Locally Connected Communication Network","Zhang, Kaiqing; Shi, Wei; Zhu, Hao; Dall'Anese, Emiliano; Basar, Tamer","24 POWER TRANSMISSION AND DISTRIBUTION; coordinated optimization; control; distribution; communications; distributed energy resources; DERs","Coordinated optimization and control of distribution-level assets can enable a reliable and optimal integration of massive amount of distributed energy resources (DERs) and facilitate distribution system management (DSM). Accordingly, the objective is to coordinate the power injection at the DERs to maintain certain quantities across the network, e.g., voltage magnitude, line flows, or line losses, to be close to a desired profile. By and large, the performance of the DSM algorithms has been challenged by two factors: i) the possibly non-strongly connected communication network over DERs that hinders the coordination; ii) the dynamics of the real system caused by the DERs with heterogeneous capabilities, time-varying operating conditions, and real-time measurement mismatches. In this paper, we investigate the modeling and algorithm design and analysis with the consideration of these two factors. In particular, a game theoretic characterization is first proposed to account for a locally connected communication network over DERs, along with the analysis of the existence and uniqueness of the Nash equilibrium (NE) therein. To achieve the equilibrium in a distributed fashion, a projected-gradient-based asynchronous DSM algorithm is then advocated. The algorithm performance, including the convergence speed and the tracking error, is analytically guaranteed under the dynamic setting. In conclusion, extensive numerical tests on both synthetic and realistic cases corroborate the analytical results derived.","IEEE","","National Renewable Energy Lab.

"A fully distributed asynchronous approach for multi-area coordinated network-constrained unit commitment","Wang, Yamin; Wu, Lei; Li, Jie","24 POWER TRANSMISSION AND DISTRIBUTION; 42 ENGINEERING","This paper discusses a consensus-based alternating direction method of multipliers (ADMM) approach to solve the multi-area coordinated network-constrained unit commitment (NCUC) problem in a distributed manner. Due to political and technical difficulties, it is neither practical nor feasible to solve the multi-area coordination problem in a centralized fashion, which requires full access to all data of individual areas. In comparison, in the proposed fully-distributed approach, local NCUC problems of individual areas can be solved independently, and only limited information is exchanged among adjacent areas for facilitating multi-area coordination. Furthermore, as traditional ADMM can only guarantee convergence for convex problems, this paper discusses several strategies to mitigate oscillations, enhance convergence performance, and derive good-enough feasible solutions, including: (i) A tie-line power flow based area coordination strategy is designed to reduce the number of global consensus variables; (ii) Different penalty parameters \r{ho} are assigned to individual consensus variables and are updated via certain rules during the iterative procedure, which would reduce the impact of initial values of \r{ho} on convergence performance; (iii) Heuristic rules are adopted to fix certain unit commitment variables for avoiding oscillations during the iterative procedure; and (iv) An asynchronous distributed strategy is studied, which solves NCUC subproblems of small areas multiple times and exchanges information with adjacent areas more frequently within one complete run of slower NCUC subproblems of large areas. Numerical cases illustrate effectiveness of the proposed asynchronous fully-distributed NCUC approach, and investigate key factors that would affect its convergence performance.","Springer","","Clarkson Univ., Potsdam, NY (United States)","USDOE Office of Electricity (OE)","","United States","2018-02-21T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: Optimization and Engineering; Journal Volume: 19; Journal Issue: 2","","Medium: ED; Size: p. 419-452","","","OE0000842","Journal ID: ISSN 1389-4420","10.1007/s11081-018-9375-8","","2023-03-16T00:00:00Z","1870058","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/1870058","https://www.osti.gov/servlets/purl/1870058","Optimization and Engineering","2","19"

This allows distributed energy resources be aggregated to provide transmission-level services without causing operational issues in the distribution grids. At the beginning of each operation interval, a transmission system controller will issue DR commands to distribution system controllers. In the first stage, the distribution system controller uses a VLSM-based dispatch algorithm to dispatch the available DR resources on the distribution feeder with an objective to minimize the total voltage deviations at the lowest cost. Then, power flow studies are conducted assuming that the DR commands have been executed. If voltage violations are detected, a second-stage VLSM-based DR dispatch will be performed to remove those violations. After that, the upper and lower DR limits calculated for the next operation interval are sent back to the transmission system controller so the transmission optimization algorithm can use them as operational constraints to make subsequent decisions. The DR resources include smart photovoltaic (PV) inverters that can curtail real power and provide reactive power support, controllable loads and capacitor banks. In conclusion, the IEEE 123-bus test system with 5-minute PV and load data is used to evaluate the performance of the algorithm. In conclusion, simulation results show that the proposed algorithm can fulfill the transmission-level DR requests while maintaining the voltage in the distribution system within limits.","IEEE","","Pacific Northwest National Lab.

Derived from nodal analysis, such approaches represent network constraints in terms of the familiar bus admittance matrix, Ybus. A fixed Ybus is unable to represent common circuit breaker actions such as bus splitting. Work-arounds for Ybus-based analysis typically rely on topology processing, switching between different Ybus matrices depending on breaker settings. In this work, we propose a very general node-breaker approach, employing multi-port element models and using a Sparse Tableau Formulation (STF) for network constraints. Instead of treating breaker action as altering network topology, and hence changing the structure of KVL and KCL equations, this approach represents a breaker's position as impacting only constraints associated with a single component, thereby maintaining fixed structure in the KVL and KCL constraints. While larger numbers of variables are required, STF proves sparser than Ybus formulations. In conclusion, numerical case studies herein demonstrate that STF provides computational efficiency comparable to a Ybus-based ACOPF at the scale of several hundred buses, and lower computational cost in an example of over one thousand buses.","IEEE","","Pacific Northwest National Lab.

"A Clarke Transformation-Based DFT Phasor and Frequency Algorithm for Wide Frequency Range","Zhan, Lingwei; Liu, Yong; Liu, Yilu","24 POWER TRANSMISSION AND DISTRIBUTION","Despite its wide applications in power grid monitoring, the classic discrete Fourier transform (DFT)-based synchrophasor estimation algorithms suffer from significant errors when the power system operates under off-nominal frequency conditions. This phenomenon is caused by spectral leakage of DFT and becomes even more severe for single-phase synchrophasor estimation. To address this issue, a theory to eliminate the spectral leakage-caused errors is proposed and a Clarke transformation-based DFT synchrophasor estimation algorithm is proposed to implement the theory in this paper. The Clarke transformation constructs a second signal that has exactly 90° phase angle difference from the original single-phase input signal and helps eliminate the estimation errors for a wide frequency range. The proposed algorithm is tested under the conditions required in the phasor measurement unit standard C37.118.1-2011 and C37.118.1a-2014, as well as the harmonic and noise conditions not required in the standard to verify its performance. More importantly, the idea of using Clarke transformation can be used for other DFT-based synchrophasor algorithms in order to achieve higher synchrophasor measurement accuracy under dynamic conditions. An example is presented at last to demonstrate the expandability of the proposed idea.","IEEE","","Oak Ridge National Lab.

Naturally, there is an ever increasing need for a tool for assessing the LTVS of a distribution system. This paper presents a fast and reliable tool for constructing inner approximations of LTVS regions in multidimensional injection space such that every point in our constructed region is guaranteed to be solvable. Numerical simulations demonstrate that our approach outperforms all existing inner approximation methods in most cases. Furthermore, the constructed regions are shown to cover substantial fractions of the true voltage stability region.

"Techno-economic analysis of DC power distribution in commercial buildings","Vossos, Vagelis; Gerber, Daniel; Bennani, Youness; Brown, Richard; Marnay, Chris","24 POWER TRANSMISSION AND DISTRIBUTION; 32 ENERGY CONSERVATION, CONSUMPTION, AND UTILIZATION; Direct current; DC distribution; Techno-economic analysis; Commercial building; DC Microgrid","Improvements in building end-use efficiency have significantly reduced the energy intensity of new buildings, but diminishing returns make it a challenge to build very-low energy buildings cost-effectively. A largely untapped efficiency strategy is to improve the efficiency of power distribution within buildings. Direct current (DC) distribution with modern power electronics has the potential to eliminate much of the power conversion loss in alternating current (AC) building distribution networks that include photovoltaics and DC end uses. Previous literature suggests up to 15% energy savings from DC power distribution in very energy efficient buildings with onsite generation and battery storage. This paper extends prior energy modeling of DC versus AC distribution in buildings, to consider the cost of implementing DC systems on a life-cycle basis. A techno-economic analysis framework based on commercially available products that evaluates the cost-effectiveness of DC systems is presented. The analysis is conducted for three commercial building types in two California climate zones and for various PV and battery storage capacities. Monte Carlo simulation is used to compute the payback period and lifecycle cost savings of DC versus AC distribution systems. A future-market scenario is also examined, which evaluates how future efficiency improvements in power converters and changes in electricity tariffs may affect cost savings. This analysis shows that DC systems can be cost-effective in all scenarios that include large capacities of battery storage and onsite solar, whereas for systems without storage, DC distribution is generally not cost-effective.","Elsevier","","Lawrence Berkeley National Lab.

Compared to state-of-the-art methods that are distributed at best, the proposed architecture requires no communication, and hence, presents a variety of advantages with regard to reliability, modularity, and cost. The method is based on the digital implementation of the dynamics of a Lienard-type oscillator circuit as the controller for the converters. Each controller only requires the locally measured output current to synthesize the pulsewidth modulation (PWM) carrier waveform. The intrinsic electrical coupling between converters drives the nonlinear-oscillator-based controllers to converge to an interleaved state with uniform phase spacing across PWM carriers, independent of the number of converters, the load, and initial conditions. We provide analytical guarantees for existence and stability of the interleaved state as well as extensive hardware results for a system of five 120 W 48 V-to-12 V dc-dc buck converters that demonstrate convergence to the interleaved state in the face of a variety of large-signal disturbances.","","","National Renewable Energy Lab.

In this work, we examine the value of these two technologies, when used independently and concurrently, for two real case studies that represent the generation mixes for the California and Midcontinent Independent System Operators (CAISO and MISO). Since both technologies provide additional system flexibility they reduce operational costs and renewable curtailment for both generation mixes under study. Interestingly, the relative impacts are quite similar when both technologies are used together. Though both flexibility options can solve some of the same issues that arise with high penetration levels of renewables, they do not seem to significantly increase or decrease the economic potential of the other technology.","Elsevier","","National Renewable Energy Lab.

However, the term 'distributed control' is often loosely applied to a variety of very different control strategies. In particular there is a lack of discrimination between aspects related to communication topology, physical distribution of components, and associated control objectives. This has lead to a lack of objective criteria for performance comparison and general quality assessment of state of the art distributed control solutions. For such comparison, a classification is required that is consistent across the different aspects mentioned above. This paper develops systematic categories of control strategies that accounts for communication, control and physical distribution aspects of the problem, and provides a set of criteria that can be assessed for these categories. The proposed taxonomy is applied to the state of the art as part of a review of existing work on distributed control of DER. Finally, we demonstrate the applicability and usefulness of the proposed classification to researchers and system designers.","IEEE","","National Renewable Energy Lab.

Particular emphasis is given to systems with high integration of renewables, where adjustments of the real and reactive output powers from renewable sources of energy are necessary in order to enforce voltage regulation. The AC OPF problem is known to be nonconvex (and, in fact, NP-hard). Convex relaxation techniques have been recently explored to solve the OPF task with reduced computational burden; however, sufficient conditions for tightness of these relaxations are only available for restricted classes of system topologies and problem setups. Identifying feasible power-flow solutions remains hard in more general problem formulations, especially in unbalanced multi-phase systems with renewables. To identify feasible and optimal AC OPF solutions in challenging scenarios where existing methods may fail, this paper leverages the Feasible Point Pursuit - Successive Convex Approximation algorithm - a powerful approach for general nonconvex quadratically constrained quadratic programs. The merits of the approach are illustrated using single- and multiphase distribution networks with renewables, as well as several transmission systems.","IEEE","","National Renewable Energy Lab.

These advancements are also bringing multi-terminal direct current (MTDC) systems closer to practical application. In addition, the continued deployment of phasor measurement units (PMUs) makes dynamic information about a large power system readily available for highly controllable components, such as HVDC lines. All these trends have increased the appeal of modulating HVDC lines and MTDC systems to provide grid services in addition to bulk power transfers. This paper provides a literature survey of HVDC and MTDC damping controllers for interarea oscillations in large interconnected power systems. The literature shows a progression from theoretical research to practical applications. Finally, there are already practical implementations of HVDC modulation for lines in point-to-point configuration, although the modulation of MTDC systems is still in the research stage.

Our model is based on linearized or ""DC"" optimal power flow, similar to models in widespread use by independent system operators (ISOs) and regional transmission operators (RTOs). Our computational experiments indicate that proactive redispatch alone can reduce the expected load shed by as much as 25% relative to standard economic dispatch. This resiliency enhancement strategy requires no capital investments and is implementable by ISOs and RTOs solely through operational adjustments. We additionally demonstrate that transmission line hardening and increases in transmission capacity can, in limited quantities, be effective strategies to further enhance power grid resiliency, although at significant capital investment cost. We perform a cross validation analysis to demonstrate the robustness of proposed recommendations. Our proposed model can be augmented to incorporate a variety of other operational and investment resilience strategies, or combination of such strategies.","Mathematical Optimization Society","","Sandia National Lab.

This paper presents a new architecture for the medium voltage AC/DC hybrid distribution network; where the AC and DC subgrids are looped by normally closed AC soft open point (ACSOP) and DC soft open point (DCSOP); respectively. The proposed AC/DC hybrid distribution systems contain renewable generation (i.e., wind power and photovoltaic (PV) generation); energy storage systems (ESSs); soft open points (SOPs); and both AC and DC flexible demands. An energy management strategy for the hybrid system is presented based on the dynamic optimal power flow (DOPF) method. The main objective of the proposed power scheduling strategy is to minimize the operating cost and reduce the curtailment of renewable generation while meeting operational and technical constraints. The proposed approach is verified in five scenarios. The five scenarios are classified as pure AC system; hybrid AC/DC system; hybrid system with interlinking converter; hybrid system with DC flexible demand; and hybrid system with SOPs. Results show that the proposed scheduling method can successfully dispatch the controllable elements; and that the presented architecture for the AC/DC hybrid distribution system is beneficial for reducing operating cost and renewable generation curtailment.","MDPI","","National Renewable Energy Lab.

There are two principal ways to control the heat flux - keep temperature fixed but adjust velocity of the carrier (typically water) or keep the velocity flow steady but then adjust temperature at the heat producing source (heat plant). Here, we study the latter scenario, commonly used for operations in Russia and Nordic countries, and analyze dynamics of the heat front as it propagates through the system. Steady velocity flows in the district heating pipelines are typically turbulent and incompressible. Changes in the heat, on either consumption or production sides, lead to slow transients which last from tens of minutes to hours. We classify relevant physical phenomena in a single pipe, e.g. turbulent spread of the turbulent front. We then explain how to describe dynamics of temperature and heat flux evolution over a network efficiently and illustrate the network solution on a simple example involving one producer and one consumer of heat connected by “hot” and “cold” pipes. We conclude the manuscript motivating future research directions.","Elsevier","","Los Alamos National Lab.

Following an outage or blackout, system operators cannot only restore one network while simply ignoring the interconnection with the other network. Effective restoration strategies that involve co-ordination between power system and communication network have become critical in enhancing the resilience. In this work, an optimisation-based restoration strategy is developed to coordinate the restoration actions between two networks. The problem is modelled as a mixed integer linear programming problem, with the objective of activating every node in both networks with the minimum number of activation/energisation of branches. The developed strategies are tested on the modified IEEE 14-bus system incorporating communication network. Simulation results demonstrate that the coordinated restoration strategies are effective and critical in the successful recovery of interdependent networks. The developed model could also provide insights in network design and planning to enhance the resilience of interdependent power system and communication network.","Institution of Engineering and Technology (IET)","","Univ. of Central Florida, Orlando, FL (United States)","USDOE; National Science Foundation (NSF)","","Country unknown/Code not available","2018-01-19T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: The Journal of Engineering Journal Volume: 2017 Journal Issue: 13","","Medium: X; Size: p. 1760-1764","","","DE‐EE0006340; DE‐EE0007327; EE0007998; EE0006340; EE0007327; ECCS-1552073","Journal ID: ISSN 2051-3305","10.1049/joe.2017.0634","","2021-01-18T00:00:00Z","1760064","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/1760064","","The Journal of Engineering","13","2017"

The problem is formulated as a two-stage stochastic mixed integer problem. The first stage is to make ROD decisions, i.e., hardening existing distribution lines and deploying ROD resources such as back-up distributed generators and automatic switches. The second stage evaluates the system operation cost during a realized extreme weather event and repair cost after the event. A novel modeling strategy is proposed to deal with the decision-dependent uncertainty of distribution line damage status, which is affected by the first-stage hardening decisions. As both stages have binary variables, a modified and computationally efficient progressive hedging algorithm with scenario bundling is introduced. The algorithm performance is evaluated by calculating lower bounds of solutions. In conclusion, the proposed model and algorithms are demonstrated on 34-bus and 123-bus test feeders.","IEEE","","Argonne National Lab.

Hydrogen can be integrated in multiple energy sectors and has the potential to increase overall energy system flexibility, improve energy security, and reduce environmental impact. In this paper, the interactions between fuel cell electric vehicles (FCEVs), hydrogen production facilities, and the electric power grid are explored. The flexibility of hydrogen production systems can create synergistic opportunities to better integrate renewable sources into the electricity system. To quantify this potential, we project the hourly system-wide balancing challenges in California out to 2025 as more renewables are deployed and electricity demand continues to grow. Passenger FCEV adoption and refueling behavior are modeled in detail to spatially and temporally resolve the hydrogen demand. We then quantify the system-wide balancing benefits of controlling hydrogen production from water electrolysis to mitigate renewable intermittency, without compromising the mobility needs of FCEV drivers. Finally, a control algorithm that can achieve different objectives, including peak shaving, valley filling, and ramping mitigation is proposed. Here, our results show that oversizing electrolyzers can provide considerable benefits to mitigate renewable intermittency, while also supporting the deployment of hydrogen vehicles to help decarbonize the transportation sector.","Elsevier","","National Renewable Energy Lab.

In the substation scheduling model, the objective is to minimize the system cost with variable renewable generations. The given error distribution model of renewable generation is formulated as a chance constraint, and derived into a deterministic form by Gaussian mixture model (GMM) with genetic algorithm-based expectation-maximization (GAEM). In the feeder scheduling model, the system cost is further reduced with the optimal power flow (OPF) at a timescale of minutes. Considering the nonconvexity of the three-phase unbalanced OPF problem in distribution systems, the semidefinite programming (SDP) is used to relax the problem into a convex problem, and a distributed computation approach is built based on alternating direction method of multiplier (ADMM). The IEEE 123-bus distribution system, DU (University of Denver) campus distribution system, and the IEEE 8500-bus distribution system are used as the test bench for the proposed approach.

Because false data injection (FDI) is one of the crucial threats faced by future microgrids, the study of the impact of FDI on distributed load sharing is both of theoretical merit and practical value. Here, we consider the distributed load sharing problem of the microgrids operating in autonomous mode under FDI. Each bus is assumed to be equipped with an agent. Under a well-developed distributed load sharing protocol based on multiagent systems, we first construct an FDI attack model, where the attacker is capable of injecting false data into the bus agents. Finally, a utilization level is introduced for coordinating generators, and its variation is evaluated in the presence of FDI attacks with given injection strategies. The stable region of the microgrid is defined, and conditions are given to determine stability. In conclusion, theoretical results are validated on the Canadian urban distribution system.","IEEE","","Univ. of Central Florida, Orlando, FL (United States)","USDOE Office of Electricity (OE)","","United States","2018-01-17T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: IEEE Translations on Industrial Electronics; Journal Volume: 66; Journal Issue: 2","","Medium: ED; Size: p. 1543-1551","","","EE0007327","Journal ID: ISSN 0278-0046","10.1109/TIE.2018.2793241","","2021-08-02T00:00:00Z","1592008","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/1592008","https://www.osti.gov/servlets/purl/1592008","IEEE Translations on Industrial Electronics","2","66"
"An Islanding Detection Test Platform for Multi-Inverter Islands Using Power HIL","Hoke, Anderson F.; Nelson, Austin; Chakraborty, Sudipta; Bell, Frances; McCarty, Michael","24 POWER TRANSMISSION AND DISTRIBUTION; anti-islanding; distributed energy resources (DER); inverters; power hardware-in-the-loop (PHIL)","When an unintentional island is formed on the electric power system, distributed energy resources (DERs) are typically required to detect and de-energize the island. This requirement may become more challenging as the number of DERs in an island rises. Thus, it is of interest to experimentally verify whether DERs can successfully detect and de-energize islands containing many DERs connected at different points. This paper presents a power hardware-in-the-loop (PHIL) platform for testing the duration of islands containing multiple inverters connected at multiple points in a network. The PHIL platform uses real-time simulation to represent islanded distribution circuits, with DER inverters connected in hardware. This allows efficient testing of a large number of island configurations simply by changing the distribution circuit model in the real-time simulator. A method for calculating the quality factor of an arbitrary distribution circuit in real time, designed for anti-islanding tests, is also presented. Experimental results are included demonstrating the use of the PHIL method to test a variety of three-inverter islands.","IEEE","","National Renewable Energy Lab.

Building on the performance of individual microgrids during extreme events, there has been an increasing interest in the operations of network microgrids. By networking microgrids during extreme events, it is possible to share resources, increase the duration for which they can operate islanded, and increase the resiliency of critical end-use loads. While there are benefits to networking the operations of resiliency-based microgrids, the switching operations that they require introduce transients which can result in a loss of dynamic stability. The issue of dynamic stability is especially acute in microgrids with high penetrations of inverter-connected generation, and a correspondingly low system inertia. While the low-inertia of these microgrids can be increased by over-sizing the rotating generators, the increased capital and operating costs can become a barrier to deployment.

Considering the huge amount of streaming PMU data, a data compression algorithm, swinging door trending (SDT), is first used to compress the PMU data and generate multiple compression intervals. Then dynamic programming is utilized to solve the optimization problem, which is recursively constituted by a score function. Based on predefined PMU event rules, dynamic programming merges adjacent compression intervals with the same slope direction. Finally, all the PMU event features are characterized. A conventional wavelet-based event detection method is compared with the developed dynamic programming based SDT (DPSDT) method. Numerical simulations on the real-time and synthetic PMU data show that the DPSDT method can accurately detect the start-time of an event and the event placement with relatively high precision. Furthermore, the PMU event features, including the magnitude and duration of strokes, are characterized.","IEEE","","National Renewable Energy Lab.

To better understand how storage transitions from increasing to decreasing system CO<sub>2</sub> emissions, we quantify the effect of storage on operational CO<sub>2</sub> emissions as a power system decarbonizes under a moderate and strong CO<sub>2</sub> emission reduction target through 2045. Under each target, we compare the effect of storage on CO<sub>2</sub> emissions when storage participates in only energy, only reserve, and energy and reserve markets. We conduct our study in the Electricity Reliability Council of Texas (ERCOT) system and use a capacity expansion model to forecast generator fleet changes and a unit commitment and economic dispatch model to quantify system CO<sub>2</sub> emissions with and without storage. We find that storage would increase CO<sub>2</sub> emissions in the current ERCOT system, but would decrease CO<sub>2</sub> emissions in 2025 through 2045 under both decarbonization targets. Storage reduces CO<sub>2</sub> emissions primarily by enabling gas-fired generation to displace coal-fired generation, but also by reducing wind and solar curtailment. We further find that the market in which storage participates drives large differences in the magnitude, but not the direction, of the effect of storage on CO<sub>2</sub> emissions.","IOP Publishing","","National Renewable Energy Lab.

"Coordinated Control of Wind Turbine and Energy Storage System for Reducing Wind Power Fluctuation","Kim, Chunghun; Muljadi, Eduard; Chung, Chung Choo","17 WIND ENERGY; 24 POWER TRANSMISSION AND DISTRIBUTION; wind power fluctuation; energy storage system (ESS); state of charge (SoC) management; coordinated control","This paper proposes a method for the coordinated control of a wind turbine and an energy storage system (ESS). Because wind power (WP) is highly dependent on wind speed, which is variable, severe stability problems can be caused in power systems, especially when the WP has a high penetration level. To solve this problem, many power generation corporations or grid operators have begun using ESSs. An ESS has very quick response and good performance for reducing the impact of WP fluctuation; however, its installation cost is high. Therefore, it is important to design the control algorithm by considering both the ESS capacity and WP fluctuation. Thus, we propose a control algorithm to mitigate the WP fluctuation by using the coordinated control between the wind turbine and the ESS by considering the ESS capacity and the WP fluctuation. Using de-loaded control, according to the WP fluctuation and ESS capacity, we can expand the ESS lifespan and improve grid reliability by avoiding the extreme value of state of charge (SoC) (i.e., 0 or 1 pu). The effectiveness of the proposed method was validated via MATLAB/Simulink by considering a small power system that includes both a wind turbine generator and conventional generators that react to system frequency deviation. We found that the proposed method has better performance in SoC management, thereby improving the frequency regulation by mitigating the impact of the WP fluctuation on the small power system.","MDPI AG","","Hanyang Univ., Seoul (Korea, Republic of); National Renewable Energy Lab.

"Coordinated Use of Smart Inverters with Legacy Voltage Regulating Devices in Distribution Systems with High Distributed PV Penetration — Increase CVR Energy Savings","Ding, Fei; Baggu, Murali","14 SOLAR ENERGY; 24 POWER TRANSMISSION AND DISTRIBUTION; photovoltaic; smart inverter; volt/VAR; CVR; reactive power control; energy saving; power quality","This paper studies the coordinated use of smart inverters with legacy voltage regulating devices to help increase the energy savings from conservation voltage reduction (CVR) in distribution systems with high photovoltaic penetration. Two voltage optimization algorithms are developed to evaluate the CVR benefit by considering two types of smart inverter functions: aggregated reactive power control and autonomous volt/VAR control. In each algorithm, smart inverters are coordinately controlled with the operation of legacy voltage regulating devices including load tap changers and capacitor banks. Both algorithms are tested on representative utility distribution system models. In conclusion, simulation results demonstrate that the proposed algorithms can achieve around 1.8-3.6% energy savings when only using legacy voltage regulating devices and an additional 0.3-0.9% when adding smart inverters.","IEEE","","National Renewable Energy Lab.

"Image phase shift invariance based cloud motion displacement vector calculation method for ultra-short-term solar PV power forecasting","Wang, Fei; Zhen, Zhao; Liu, Chun; Mi, Zengqiang; Hodge, Bri-Mathias; Shafie-khah, Miadreza; Catalao, Joao P. S.","14 SOLAR ENERGY; 24 POWER TRANSMISSION AND DISTRIBUTION; phase correlation; Fourier transform; cloud motion displacement vector; sky image; solar forecasting","Irradiance received on the earth's surface is the main factor that affects the output power of solar PV plants, and is chiefly determined by the cloud distribution seen in a ground-based sky image at the corresponding moment in time. It is the foundation for those linear extrapolation-based ultra-short-term solar PV power forecasting approaches to obtain the cloud distribution in future sky images from the accurate calculation of cloud motion displacement vectors (CMDVs) by using historical sky images. Theoretically, the CMDV can be obtained from the coordinate of the peak pulse calculated from a Fourier phase correlation theory (FPCT) method through the frequency domain information of sky images. The peak pulse is significant and unique only when the cloud deformation between two consecutive sky images is slight enough, which is likely possible for a very short time interval (such as 1?min or shorter) with common changes in the speed of cloud. Sometimes, there will be more than one pulse with similar values when the deformation of the clouds between two consecutive sky images is comparatively obvious under fast changing cloud speeds. This would probably lead to significant errors if the CMDVs were still only obtained from the single coordinate of the peak value pulse. However, the deformation estimation of clouds between two images and its influence on FPCT-based CMDV calculations are terrifically complex and difficult because the motion of clouds is complicated to describe and model. Therefore, to improve the accuracy and reliability under these circumstances in a simple manner, an image-phase-shift-invariance (IPSI) based CMDV calculation method using FPCT is proposed for minute time scale solar power forecasting. First, multiple different CMDVs are calculated from the corresponding consecutive images pairs obtained through different synchronous rotation angles compared to the original images by using the FPCT method. Second, the final CMDV is generated from all of the calculated CMDVs through a centroid iteration strategy based on its density and distance distribution. Third, the influence of different rotation angle resolution on the final CMDV is analyzed as a means of parameter estimation. Simulations under various scenarios including both thick and thin clouds conditions indicated that the proposed IPSI-based CMDV calculation method using FPCT is more accurate and reliable than the original FPCT method, optimal flow (OF) method, and particle image velocimetry (PIV) method.","Elsevier","","National Renewable Energy Lab.

"Understanding DERMS","Seal, Brian","24 POWER TRANSMISSION AND DISTRIBUTION","With the rapid deployment of distributed energy resources (DER), there is a high level of interest in how these devices can be integrated with utility operations at all levels for management and monitoring purposes. This integration is challenging in that the number of devices is high and that ownership is often that of a customer or third party. Industry stakeholders first began to address DER integration by identifying and standardizing the functions that individual DER can perform autonomously, a distributed manner. Device-level functions like “voltage ride-through”, “volt-var”, “frequency-watt”, and “dynamic reactive current” were designed and documented and are now supported by communication standards and grid codes worldwide, making grid-supportive capabilities mandatory for new interconnections. This was a first step. A necessary step, but not sufficient to achieve end-to-end integration of DER with the grid. A substantial gap was recognized between the granular controls of individual DER and the type of organized services needed for grid support, integration with distribution management systems (DMS) and grid operations. In 2012, stakeholders began working to define a common set of grid-supportive services and means to integrate large quantities of DERs into utility systems in a way that is practical, sustainable and extensible. Because multiple parties could be involved; utilities, DMS providers, DER aggregators and facility/microgrid controller providers are working together.","EPRI","","PPL Electric Utilities Corp., Allentown, PA (United States)","USDOE Office of Energy Efficiency and Renewable Energy (EERE), Renewable Power Office.

The inverters in the system can adjust their frequencies and power angles very quickly, so the modeling focuses on establishing a common reference frequency and angle in the microgrid based on the spinning machines. From this dynamic model, nonlinear Hamiltonian surface shaping and power flow control method is applied and shown to stabilize. From this approach the energy flow in the system is used to show the energy storage device requirements and limitations for the system. This paper first describes the model for a single bus AC microgrid with a Hamiltonian control, then extends this model and control to a more general class of multiple bus AC microgrids. Finally, simulation results demonstrate the efficacy of the approach in stabilizing and optimization of the microgrid.","Elsevier","","Sandia National Lab.

This has included debate about the cost associated with integrating these generators onto the electric grid. For photovoltaics (PV), this encompasses costs incurred on both the bulk power and distribution systems, as well as the value provided to them. These costs and benefits, in particular those associated with integrating PV onto the distribution system, are not well understood. We seek to advance the state of understanding of 'grid integration costs' for the distribution system by reviewing prior literature and outlining a transparent, bottom-up approach that can be used to calculate these costs. We provide a clear delineation of costs to integrate PV in to the distribution system within the larger context of total costs and benefits associated with PV generators. We emphasize that these costs are situationally dependent, and that a single 'cost of integration' cannot be obtained. We additionally emphasize that benefits must be considered when evaluating the competitiveness of the technology in a given situation.","Elsevier","","National Renewable Energy Lab.

Here, this paper provides a formal approach to evaluate the operational resiliency of PDS, and quantify the resiliency of a system using a code-based metric. A combination of steady state and dynamic simulation tools is used to determine the resiliency metric. Dynamic simulation tools help with analyzing impact of short-term events, which might affect operational resiliency in long term. A dynamic optimization algorithm for changing operating criteria to increase the sustainability of the most critical loads has been proposed. The proposed theoretical approach is validated using a simple power distribution system model and simulation results demonstrate the ability to quantify the resiliency using the proposed code-based metric. The time-dependent quantification of resiliency has been demonstrated on a test system of two connected CERTS microgrids.","IEEE","","Idaho National Lab.

This paper demonstrates a co-simulation based on AS-PSH units between penstock hydrodynamics and power system events in a real-time environment. Co-simulation provides an accurate insight into the dynamic and transient operation of AS-PSH connected to a bulk power system network. The two modes of operation of AS-PSH presented in this paper are turbine and pump modes. A general philosophy of operating in turbine mode is prevalent in the field when the prices of electricity are high and in the pumping mode when prices are low.

"Analyzing storage for wind integration in a transmission-constrained power system","Jorgenson, Jennie; Denholm, Paul; Mai, Trieu","17 WIND ENERGY; 24 POWER TRANSMISSION AND DISTRIBUTION; energy storage; wind energy; production cost modeling; transmission; renewable curtailment","High levels of energy from variable generation sources such as wind and solar photovoltaics (PV) can result in significant curtailment, in which the wind and PV energy cannot be used to serve demand. Adding transmission and energy storage can assist in reducing renewable curtailment, but the relative merits of each enabling technology individually or combined is not well understood. Thus, we compare the role of transmission and storage in reducing curtailment, as well as reducing generation costs from conventional sources. Using a high-fidelity model of the electric power grid, we examine a scenario in which the western portion of the U.S. and Canada reaches 37% energy from wind and 12% energy from solar PV. In the case studied, we find that transmission is generally more effective than energy storage in reducing curtailment, due to the curtailment patterns of wind. However, the interaction between transmission and energy storage shows that the two technologies act symbiotically, meaning that their combined energy value is greater than that of each individually. This analysis demonstrates that fully realizing the benefits of wind resources located far from demand centers will require an effective method to deliver wind power at the right times to the right locations.","Elsevier","","National Renewable Energy Lab.

Our paper focuses on a case study of four diurnal cycles with significant power production, and assesses the skill of the wind farm parameterization (WFP) distributed with the Weather Research and Forecasting (WRF) model version 3.8.1, as well as its sensitivity to model configuration. After validating the simulated ambient flow with observations, we quantify the value of the WFP as it accounts for wake impacts on power production of downwind turbines. We also illustrate with statistical significance that a vertical grid with approximately 12 m vertical resolution is necessary for reproducing the observed power production. Further, the WFP overestimates wake effects and hence underestimates downwind power production during high wind speed, highly stable, and low turbulence conditions. We also find the WFP performance is independent of the number of wind turbines per model grid cell and the upwind–downwind position of turbines. Rather, the ability of the WFP to predict power production is most dependent on the skill of the WRF model in simulating the ambient wind speed.</p>","European Geosciences Union","","National Renewable Energy Lab.

We show that the vulnerable set consists of a small but topologically central portion of the network and that large cascades are disproportionately more likely to be triggered by initial failures close to this set.

However, there is a shortage of realistic test systems that are publically available for development, testing, and evaluation of such new algorithms. Concerns around revealing critical infrastructure details and customer privacy have severely limited the number of actual networks published and that are available for testing.

This paper presents a first-of-a-kind structured literature review of published distribution test networks with a special emphasis on classifying their main characteristics and identifying the types of studies for which they have been used. As a result, this both aids researchers in choosing suitable test networks for their needs and highlights the opportunities and directions for further test system development.

"EMP Coupling to a Straight Conductor Above Ground: Transmission Line Formulation Based on Electromagnetic Reciprocity","Olsen, Robert G.; Tarditi, Alfonso G.","24 POWER TRANSMISSION AND DISTRIBUTION; Electromagnetic pulse (EMP); high-voltage transmission lines; transmission line analysis","A simple model for coupling of an electromagnetic plane wave incident on a conductor above ground has been developed using reciprocity theory, providing some advantages as compared to the conventional transmission line approach. The model is developed using a semi-infinitely long single conductor above a lossy ground plane and connected by an arbitrary load impedance to a vertical grounding conductor. This configuration corresponds to the worst-case wave coupling, because it leads to a line induced current larger than in the cases of finite and multiconductor lines. A frequency-domain Thévenin equivalent model is developed to relate the incident wave amplitude to the voltage across a generic load, connected at any point on the vertical conductor. The application to the threat analysis of a high-altitude electromagnetic pulse impact on a power transmission line is discussed by considering the time-domain solution (via inverse Fourier transform) for an incident EMP fast-rise transient (E1) waveshape, following the standard IEC specifications. For typical high-voltage power line load impedances, it is shown that voltage magnitudes in the MV range can be induced across the line termination, in the case of a wave with a near-grazing incidence angle and with wave vector aligned along the horizontal conductor.","IEEE","","Oak Ridge National Lab.

The platform must be multi-tasking and able to host multiple applications running simultaneously. Given such a system, the core functions of power grid control systems include grid state determination, low level control, fault intelligence and reconfiguration, outage intelligence, power quality measurement, remote asset monitoring, configuration management, power and energy management (including local distributed energy resources, such as wind, solar and energy storage) can be eventually distributed. However, making this move requires extensive regression testing of systems to prove out new technologies, such as phasor measurement units (PMU). Additionally, as the complexity of the systems increase with the inclusion of new functionality (especially at the distribution and consumer levels), hidden coupling issues becomes a challenge with possible N-way interactions known and not known by device and application developers. Therefore, it is very important to provide core abstractions that ensure uniform operational semantics across such interactions.

PV inertia and governor emulation requires reserving PV output and leads to solar energy waste. This paper exploits current grid resources and explores energy storage for primary frequency response under high PV penetration at the interconnection level. Based on the actual models of the U.S. Eastern Interconnection grid and the Texas grid, effects of multiple factors associated with primary frequency response, including the governor ratio, governor deadband, droop rate, and fast load response, are assessed under high PV penetration scenarios. In addition, performance of batteries and supercapacitors using different control strategies is studied in the two interconnections.

The beams are generated using a quantum cascade laser (QCL) in combination with a Fourier phase grating. The grating is fully characterized using a third order distributed feedback (DFB) QCL with a single mode emission at 4.7 THz as the input. The measured diffraction efficiency of 74.3% is in an excellent agreement with the calculated result of 75.4% using a 3D simulation. We show that the power distribution among the diffracted beams is uniform enough for pumping an array receiver. To validate the grating bandwidth, we apply a far-infrared (FIR) gas laser emission at 5.3 THz as the input and find a very similar performance in terms of efficiency, power distribution, and spatial configuration of the diffracted beams. Both results represent the highest operating frequencies of THz phase gratings reported in the literature. By injecting one of the eight diffracted 4.7 THz beams into a superconducting hot electron bolometer (HEB) mixer, we find that the coupled power, taking the optical loss into account, is in consistency with the QCL power value.","Optical Society of America (OSA)","","Sandia National Lab.

Though the underlying mechanism has been relatively well understood, the accurate assessment and effective enhancement of the U.S. interconnections' frequency response under extra-high PV penetration conditions remains an issue. In this paper, the industry-provided full-detail interconnection models were further validated by synchrophasor frequency measurements and realistically-projected PV geographic distribution information were used to develop extra-high PV penetration scenarios and dynamic models for the three main U.S. interconnections, including Eastern Interconnection (EI), Western Electricity Coordinating Council (WECC), and Electric Reliability Council of Texas (ERCOT). Up to 65% instantaneous PV and 15% wind penetration were simulated and the frequency response change trend of each U.S. interconnection due to the increasing PV penetration level were examined. Most importantly, the practical solutions to address the declining frequency response were discussed. This paper will provide valuable guidance for policy makers, utility operators and academic researchers not only in the U.S. but also other countries in the world.","IEEE","","National Renewable Energy Lab.

Based on experimental findings electrolyzer systems are observed to have a high level of controllability and hence can add flexibility to the grid from demand side. Greater awareness and controllability is proposed, developed, implemented, and tested by a 'frond end controller' in real-time environment. It can optimize the operation of electrolyzer systems based on the information collected by a communication module. Real-time tests are performed to verify the performance of front end controller driven electrolyzers to provide grid support that enables greater economic revenue and grid support for hydrogen producers under dynamic conditions.

The optimal multi-energy coordinated scheduling, in which uncertainties of renewable energy generation and electricity demand are described by uncertainty intervals, is considered within the capacity planning model. To solve the capacity planning problem while considering the optimal scheduling with uncertainties, a two-level optimisation approach is proposed by integrating interval mixed integer linear programming for scheduling into the multi-objective particle swarm optimisation for capacity planning. The multi-objective addresses the economic issue by minimising the worst-case optimal annual costs of device investments, operation and maintenance, and pollutant emission treatment, as well as the reliability concern by minimising the worst-case optimal annual costs of energy outage.

In the framework, correlations of SCADA and Phasor Measurements (PMUs) are calculated separately through unscented transformation and a Vector Auto-Regression (VAR) model. In particular, PMU measurements during the waiting period of two SCADA measurement scans are buffered to develop the VAR model with robustly estimated parameters using projection statistics approach. The latter takes into account the temporal and spatial correlations of PMU measurements and provides redundant measurements to suppress bad data and mitigate imperfect synchronization. In case where the SCADA and PMU measurements are not time synchronized, either the forecasted PMU measurements or the prior SCADA measurements from the last estimation run are leveraged to restore system observability. Then, a robust generalized maximum-likelihood (GM)-estimator is extended to integrate measurement error correlations and to handle the outliers in the SCADA and PMU measurements. Simulation results that stem from a comprehensive comparison with other alternatives under various conditions demonstrate the benefits of the proposed framework.","IEEE","","Pacific Northwest National Lab.

Their simulation efficiency is generally constrained by the EMT simulation. With an increasing number of distributed energy resources and non-conventional loads being installed in distribution systems, it is imperative to extend the hybrid simulation application to include distribution systems and integrated transmission and distribution systems. Meanwhile, it is equally important to improve the simulation efficiency as the modeling scope and complexity of the detailed system in the EMT simulation increases. To meet both requirements, this paper introduces an advanced EMT and phasor-domain hybrid simulation approach. This approach has two main features: 1) a comprehensive phasor-domain modeling framework which supports positive-sequence, three-sequence, three-phase and mixed three-sequence/three-phase representations and 2) a robust and flexible simulation mode switching scheme. The developed scheme enables simulation switching from hybrid simulation mode back to pure phasor-domain dynamic simulation mode to achieve significantly improved simulation efficiency. The proposed method has been tested on integrated transmission and distribution systems. In conclusion, the results show that with the developed simulation switching feature, the total computational time is significantly reduced compared to running the hybrid simulation for the whole simulation period, while maintaining good simulation accuracy.","IEEE","","Pacific Northwest National Lab.

We utilise this fact to devise a novel methodology to estimate the contribution of a load-shifting demand response resource to system adequacy. We then simulate an electricity market using mixed complementarity models to determine how the participation of demand response in capacity markets impacts on market outcomes. Demand response primarily affects the equilibrium outcome through the energy market, however demand response also reduces both equilibrium prices and consumer costs through its capacity market contribution. The effect is particularly pronounced when there is a high level of variable renewable generation and initial undercapacity. In the absence of demand response, increased wind generation leads to higher capacity prices as generators seek to offset depressed energy prices. However, we find that demand response's participation in the capacity market can combat these increased capacity prices. These results suggest that demand response participation in capacity markets can mitigate some of the market challenges of renewable integration, particularly that of the 'missing money' problem.","","","National Renewable Energy Lab.

In particular, the droop slopes are engineered such that DERs respond in proportion to their power ratings and they are not unfairly penalized in power provisioning based on their location in the distribution network. The main contribution of our approach is that a guaranteed level of frequency regulation can be guaranteed at the feeder head, while ensuring that the outputs of individual DERs conform to some well-defined notion of fairness. The approach we adopt leverages an optimization-based perspective and suitable linearizations of the power-flow equations to embed notions of fairness and information regarding the physics of the power flows within the distribution network into the droop slopes. Time-domain simulations from a differential algebraic equation model of the 39-bus New England test-case system augmented with three instances of the IEEE 37-node distribution-network with frequency-sensitive DERs are provided to validate our approach.","IEEE","","National Renewable Energy Lab.

"Survivability of Autonomous Microgrid during Overload Events","Du, Wei; Lasseter, Robert H.; Khalsa, Amrit S.","24 POWER TRANSMISSION AND DISTRIBUTION; Microgrids; Frequency control; Voltage control; Inverters; Transient analysis; Switches; survivability; overload mitigation; grid-forming source; droop control","Grid-forming sources are voltage sources that draw necessary currents to meet any load changes. A load step can cause part or all of these sources to become overloaded in a microgrid. This paper presents an overload mitigation controller that addresses the two overload issues in a microgrid by actively controlling the sources’ frequency. When part of the sources in a microgrid is overloaded, the controller autonomously transfers the extra load to other sources by rapidly reducing its frequency. The frequency difference between sources during transient results in a change of phase angle, which redistributes the power flow. When all sources in a microgrid are overloaded, each source keeps dropping the frequency. Therefore, under frequency load shedding can be used to trip the non-critical loads resulting in the survival of microgrid. The advantages of these concepts are that communications between sources are not needed during transient, and the robust voltage control is maintained. Simulation and field tests from CERTS/AEP microgrid test site verify that the control strategy is effective in both purely inverter-based microgrids and inverter & generator mixed microgrids.","IEEE","","Pacific Northwest National Lab.

"An enhanced SOCP-based method for feeder load balancing using the multi-terminal soft open point in active distribution networks","Ji, Haoran; Wang, Chengshan; Li, Peng; Zhao, Jinli; Song, Guanyu; Ding, Fei; Wu, Jianzhong","24 POWER TRANSMISSION AND DISTRIBUTION; distributed generator; flexible interconnection; multi-terminal soft open point; feeder load balancing; enhanced second-order cone programming","The integration of distributed generators (DGs) exacerbates the feeder power flow fluctuation and load unbalanced condition in active distribution networks (ADNs). The unbalanced feeder load causes inefficient use of network assets and network congestion during system operation. The flexible interconnection based on the multi-terminal soft open point (SOP) significantly benefits the operation of ADNs. The multi-terminal SOP, which is a controllable power electronic device installed to replace the normally open point, provides accurate active and reactive power flow control to enable the flexible connection of feeders. An enhanced SOCP-based method for feeder load balancing using the multi-terminal SOP is proposed in this paper. Furthermore, by regulating the operation of the multi-terminal SOP, the proposed method can mitigate the unbalanced condition of feeder load and simultaneously reduce the power losses of ADNs. Then, the original non-convex model is converted into a second-order cone programming (SOCP) model using convex relaxation. In order to tighten the SOCP relaxation and improve the computation efficiency, an enhanced SOCP-based approach is developed to solve the proposed model. Finally, case studies are performed on the modified IEEE 33-node system to verify the effectiveness and efficiency of the proposed method.","Elsevier","","National Renewable Energy Lab.

The reliability of system operations and smooth integration of wind energy into electricity markets has been strongly supported by years of improvement in weather and wind power forecasting systems. Deterministic forecasts are still predominant in utility practice although truly optimal decisions and risk hedging are only possible with the adoption of uncertainty forecasts. One of the main barriers for the industrial adoption of uncertainty forecasts is the lack of understanding of its information content (e.g., its physical and statistical modeling) and standardization of uncertainty forecast products, which frequently leads to mistrust towards uncertainty forecasts and their applicability in practice. Our paper aims at improving this understanding by establishing a common terminology and reviewing the methods to determine, estimate, and communicate the uncertainty in weather and wind power forecasts. This conceptual analysis of the state of the art highlights that: (i) end-users should start to look at the forecast's properties in order to map different uncertainty representations to specific wind energy-related user requirements; (ii) a multidisciplinary team is required to foster the integration of stochastic methods in the industry sector. Furthermore, a set of recommendations for standardization and improved training of operators are provided along with examples of best practices.","MDPI AG","","National Renewable Energy Lab.

On one hand, most distributed energy resources (DER) are converter-interfaced and do not inherently respond to frequency variations. On the other hand, current inertia emulation approach cannot provide guaranteed response. In this paper, a model reference control based inertia emulation strategy is proposed for the diesel-wind systems. Desired inertia can be precisely emulated through the proposed strategy. A typical frequency response model with parametric inertia is set to be the reference model. A measurement at a specific location delivers the information about the disturbance acting on the diesel-wind system to the reference model. The objective is for the speed of the diesel generator to track the reference so that the desired inertial response is realized. In addition, polytopic parameter uncertainty will be considered. The control strategy is configured in different ways according to different operating points. The parameters of the reference model are scheduled to ensure adequate frequency response under a pre-defined worst case. The controller is implemented in a nonlinear three-phase diesel-wind system fed microgrid using the Simulink software platform. Lastly, the results show exact synthetic inertia is emulated and adequate frequency response is achieved.","IEEE","","Oak Ridge National Lab.

There is considerable interest in integrating intermittent renewable energy and plug-in electric vehicles into power systems. Therefore, power systems are in an environment with increasing uncertain variability. In this paper, the uncertain variability is described as a continuous-time stochastic process, and thus, the power system under uncertain variability is modeled by stochastic differential equations. To quantify impacts of uncertain variability on power system dynamics, an intra-region probability index is presented. Based on the stochastic averaging method, an analytical method is proposed to calculate the intra-region probability. Compared to Monte Carlo simulation, the proposed method is many orders of magnitude faster without sacrificing the result accuracy. As a result, several insights are given to improve the power system dynamics under uncertain variability.","IEEE","","Oak Ridge National Lab.

"Impedance-Based Stability Analysis in Grid Interconnection Impact Study Owing to the Increased Adoption of Converter-Interfaced Generators","Cho, Youngho; Hur, Kyeon; Kang, Yong; Muljadi, Eduard","24 POWER TRANSMISSION AND DISTRIBUTION; impedance-based stability; generator interconnection; converter-interfaced generation; harmonic stability","This study investigates the emerging harmonic stability concerns to be addressed by grid planners in generation interconnection studies, owing to the increased adoption of renewable energy resources connected to the grid via power electronic converters. The wideband and high-frequency electromagnetic transient (EMT) characteristics of these converter-interfaced generators (CIGs) and their interaction with the grid impedance are not accurately captured in the typical dynamic studies conducted by grid planners. This paper thus identifies the desired components to be studied and subsequently develops a practical process for integrating a new CIG into a grid with the existing CIGs. The steps of this process are as follows: the impedance equation of a CIG using its control dynamics and an interface filter to the grid, for example, an LCL filter (inductor-capacitor-inductor type), is developed; an equivalent impedance model including the existing CIGs nearby and the grid observed from the point of common coupling are derived; the system stability for credible operating scenarios is assessed. Detailed EMT simulations validate the accuracy of the impedance models and stability assessment for various connection scenarios. Here, by complementing the conventional EMT simulation studies, the proposed analytical approach enables grid planners to identify critical design parameters for seamlessly integrating a new CIG and ensuring the reliability of the grid.","MDPI AG","","National Renewable Energy Lab.

"Proposal and evaluation of subordinate standard solar irradiance spectra for applications in solar energy systems","Jessen, Wilko; Wilbert, Stefan; Gueymard, Christian A.; Polo, Jesus; Bian, Zeqiang; Driesse, Anton; Habte, Aron; Marzo, Aitor; Armstrong, Peter R.; Vignola, Frank; Ramirez, Lourdes","14 SOLAR ENERGY; 24 POWER TRANSMISSION AND DISTRIBUTION; solar spectra; efficiency rating; spectral response; standardization","Reference solar irradiance spectra are needed to specify key parameters of solar technologies such as photovoltaic cell efficiency, in a comparable way. The IEC 60904-3 and ASTM G173 standards present such spectra for Direct Normal Irradiance (DNI) and Global Tilted Irradiance (GTI) on a 37 degrees tilted sun-facing surface for one set of clear-sky conditions with an air mass of 1.5 and low aerosol content. The IEC/G173 standard spectra are the widely accepted references for these purposes. Hence, the authors support the future replacement of the outdated ISO 9845 spectra with the IEC spectra within the ongoing update of this ISO standard. The use of a single reference spectrum per component of irradiance is important for clarity when comparing and rating solar devices such as PV cells. However, at some locations the average spectra can differ strongly from those defined in the IEC/G173 standards due to widely different atmospheric conditions and collector tilt angles. Therefore, additional subordinate standard spectra for other atmospheric conditions and tilt angles are of interest for a rough comparison of product performance under representative field conditions, in addition to using the main standard spectrum for product certification under standard test conditions. This simplifies the product selection for solar power systems when a fully-detailed performance analysis is not feasible (e.g. small installations). Also, the effort for a detailed yield analyses can be reduced by decreasing the number of initial product options. After appropriate testing, this contribution suggests a number of additional spectra related to eight sets of atmospheric conditions and tilt angles that are currently considered within ASTM and ISO working groups. The additional spectra, called subordinate standard spectra, are motivated by significant spectral mismatches compared to the IEC/G173 spectra (up to 6.5%, for PV at 37 degrees tilt and 10-15% for CPV). These mismatches correspond to potential accuracy improvements for a quick estimation of the average efficiency by applying the appropriate subordinate standard spectrum instead of the IEC/G173 spectra. The applicability of these spectra for PV performance analyses is confirmed at five test sites, for which subordinate spectra could be intuitively selected based on the average atmospheric aerosol optical depth (AOD) and precipitable water vapor at those locations. The development of subordinate standard spectra for DNI and concentrating solar power (CSP) and concentrating PV (CPV) is also considered. However, it is found that many more sets of atmospheric conditions would be required to allow the intuitive selection of DNI spectra for the five test sites, due in particular to the stronger effect of AOD on DNI compared to GTI. In conclusion, the matrix of subordinate GTI spectra described in this paper are recommended to appear as an option in the annex of future standards, in addition to the obligatory use of the main spectrum from the ASTM G173 and IEC 60904 standards.","Elsevier","","National Renewable Energy Lab.

This paper proposes a multiport bidirectional switched reluctance motor (SRM) drive for solar-assisted HEB (SHEB) powertrain, which not only improves the motoring performance, but also achieves flexible charging functions. To extend the driving miles and achieve self-charging ability, photovoltaic (PV) panels are installed on the bus to decrease the reliance on fuelsbatteries and charging stations. A bidirectional front-end circuit with a PV-fed circuit is designed to integrate electrical components into one converter. Six driving and five charging modes are achieved. The dc voltage is boosted by the battery in generator control unit (GCU) driving mode and by the charge capacitor in battery driving mode, where the torque capability is improved. Usually, an extra converter is needed to achieve battery charging. In this paper, the battery can be directly charged by the demagnetization current in GCU or PV driving mode, and can be quickly charged by the PV panels and GCUAC grids at SHEB standstill conditions, by utilizing the traction motor windings and integrated converter circuit, without external charging converters.

"Cost comparison of printed circuit heat exchanger to low cost periodic flow regenerator for use as recuperator in a s-CO<sub>2</sub> Brayton cycle","Hinze, Jacob F.; Nellis, Gregory F.; Anderson, Mark H.","42 ENGINEERING; 24 POWER TRANSMISSION AND DISTRIBUTION; 32 ENERGY CONSERVATION, CONSUMPTION, AND UTILIZATION; Supercritical CO2; Brayton; Regenerator; Recuperator","Supercritical Carbon Dioxide (sCO<sub>2</sub>) power cycles have the potential to deliver high efficiency at low cost. However, in order for an sCO<sub>2</sub> cycle to reach high efficiency, highly effective recuperators are needed. These recuperative heat exchangers must transfer heat at a rate that is substantially larger than the heat transfer to the cycle itself and can therefore represent a significant portion of the power block costs. Regenerators are proposed as a cost saving alternative to high cost printed circuit recuperators for this application. A regenerator is an indirect heat exchanger which periodically stores and releases heat to the working fluid. The simple design of a regenerator can be made more inexpensively compared to current options. The objective of this paper is a detailed evaluation of regenerators as a competing technology for recuperators within an sCO<sub>2</sub> Brayton cycle. The level of the analysis presented here is sufficient to identify issues with the regenerator system in order to direct future work and also to clarify the potential advantage of pursuing this technology. A reduced order model of a regenerator is implemented into a cycle model of an sCO<sub>2</sub> Brayton cycle. An economic analysis investigates the cost savings that is possible by switching from recuperative heat exchangers to switched-bed regenerators. The cost of the regenerators was estimated using the amount of material required if the pressure vessel is sized using ASME Boiler Pressure Vessel Code (BPVC) requirements. The cost of the associated valves is found to be substantial for the regenerator system and is estimated in collaboration with an industrial valve supplier. The result of this analysis suggests that a 21.2% reduction in the contribution to the Levelized Cost of Electricity (LCoE) from the power block can be realized by switching to a regenerator-based system.","Elsevier","","Univ. of Wisconsin, Madison, WI (United States)","USDOE","","United States","2017-09-21T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: Applied Energy; Journal Volume: 208; Journal Issue: C","","Medium: ED; Size: p. 1150-1161","","","EE0007120","Journal ID: ISSN 0306-2619; PII: S0306261917313120","10.1016/j.apenergy.2017.09.037","","2021-07-26T00:00:00Z","1434935","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/1434935","https://www.osti.gov/servlets/purl/1434935","Applied Energy","C","208"

"New Educational Modules Using a Cyber-Distribution System Testbed","Xie, Jing; Bedoya, Juan Carlos; Liu, Chen-Ching; Hahn, Adam; Kaur, Kudrat; Singh, Rajveer","24 POWER TRANSMISSION AND DISTRIBUTION","At Washington State University (WSU), a modern cyber-physical system testbed has been implemented based on an industry grade distribution management system (DMS) that is integrated with remote terminal units (RTUs), smart meters, and a solar photovoltaic (PV). In addition, the real model from the Avista Utilities distribution system in Pullman, WA, is modeled in DMS. The proposed testbed environment allows students and instructors to utilize these facilities for innovations in learning and teaching. For power engineering education, this testbed helps students understand the interaction between a cyber system and a physical distribution system through industrial level visualization. The testbed provides a distribution system monitoring and control environment for students. Compared with a simulation based approach, the testbed brings the students' learning environment a step closer to the real world. The educational modules allow students to learn the concepts of a cyber-physical system and an electricity market through an integrated testbed. Furthermore, the testbed provides a platform in the study mode for students to practice working on a real distribution system model. Here, this paper describes the new educational modules based on the testbed environment. Three modules are described together with the underlying educational principles and associated projects.","IEEE","","Pacific Northwest National Lab.

In most developed countries, these requirements also apply to renewable sources, mainly wind power plants and photovoltaic installations connected to the grid. This study proposes an alternative characterisation solution to classify and visualise a large number of collected events in light of current limits and requirements. The authors' approach is based on linearised root-mean-square-(RMS)-voltage trajectories, taking into account LRVT requirements, and a clustering process to identify the most likely pattern trajectories. The proposed solution gives extensive information on an event's severity by providing a simple but complete visualisation of the linearised RMS-voltage patterns. In addition, these patterns are compared to current LVRT requirements to determine similarities or discrepancies. A large number of collected events can then be automatically classified and visualised for comparative purposes. Real disturbances collected from renewable sources in Spain are used to assess the proposed solution. Extensive results and discussions are also included in this study.","Institution of Engineering and Technology","","National Renewable Energy Lab.

"Optimal Transmission Line Switching under Geomagnetic Disturbances","Lu, Mowen; Nagarajan, Harsha; Yamangil, Emre; Bent, Russell; Backhaus, Scott; Barnes, Arthur","24 POWER TRANSMISSION AND DISTRIBUTION; GMD; transmission line switching; convex relaxations; ACOPF; GIC","Recently, there have been increasing concerns about how geomagnetic disturbances (GMDs) impact electrical power systems. Geomagnetically-induced currents (GICs) can saturate transformers, induce hot spot heating and increase reactive power losses. These effects can potentially cause catastrophic damage to transformers and severely impact the ability of a power system to deliver power. To address this problem, we develop a model of GIC impacts to power systems that includes 1) GIC thermal capacity of transformers as a function of normal Alternating Current (AC) and 2) reactive power losses as a function of GIC. We also use this model to derive an optimization problem that protects power systems from GIC impacts through line switching, generator dispatch, and load shedding. We then employ state-of-the-art convex relaxations of AC power flow equations to lower bound the objective. We demonstrate the approach on a modified RTS96 system and UIUC 150-bus system and show that line switching is an effective means to mitigate GIC impacts. We also provide a sensitivity analysis of decisions with respect to GMD direction.","IEEE","","Los Alamos National Lab.

"Distributed Link Removal Using Local Estimation of Network Topology","Gusrialdi, Azwirman; Qu, Zhihua; Hirche, Sandra","97 MATHEMATICS AND COMPUTING; Link removal; largest eigenvalue minimization; distributed algorithm; matrix perturbation; 24 POWER TRANSMISSION AND DISTRIBUTION","This paper considers the problem of network structure manipulation in the absence of information on the global network topology. In particular, the problem of removing some of links is investigated in order to slow or stop the spread of disease in a network while preserving its connectivity. Existing methods solve this combinatorial problem in a centralized manner and they require the global information of network structure. In this paper, we propose a distributed design algorithm to compute a suboptimal solution to this problem efficiently by mimicking gradient based method, namely by iteratively removing one or multiple links at a time from the network. Specifically, using matrix perturbation analysis we formulate an optimization problem involving the eigenvector associated with the largest eigenvalue of the adjacency matrix and whose solution is equal to a suboptimal solution to the original problem. This strategy also enables us to overcome the combinatorial issue of the problem. Distributed algorithms to estimate the eigenvector and to verify network's connectivity are then proposed which facilitate us to solve the new optimization problem. In addition, topological insights into the proposed algorithm and optimality of its solution are also discussed. Finally, the proposed distributed design method is demonstrated and evaluated via several numerical examples.","IEEE","","Univ. of Central Florida, Orlando, FL (United States)","USDOE Office of Energy Efficiency and Renewable Energy (EERE); National Science Foundation (NSF); US Department of Transportation; L-3 Communication; Leidos","","United States","2018-03-12T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: IEEE Transactions on Network Science and Engineering; Journal Volume: 6; Journal Issue: 3","","Medium: ED; Size: p. 280-292","","","EE0007327; EE0006340; ECCS-1308928; CCF-0956501; DTRT13-G-UTC51; 11013I2034; P010161530; EE0007998","Journal ID: ISSN 2334-329X","10.1109/TNSE.2018.2813426","","2020-04-29T00:00:00Z","1601126","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/1601126","https://www.osti.gov/servlets/purl/1601126","IEEE Transactions on Network Science and Engineering","3","6"
"Enabling CCS via Low-temperature Geothermal Energy Integration for Fossil-fired Power Generation","Davidson, Casie L.; Heldebrant, D. J.; Bearden, M. D.; Horner, J. A.; Freeman, C. J.","24 POWER TRANSMISSION AND DISTRIBUTION; geothermal; CO2BOLs; CCS; GHGT13","Here, among the key barriers to commercial scale deployment is the cost associated with CO<sub>2</sub> capture. This is particularly true for existing large, fossil-fired assets that account for a large fraction of the electricity generation fleet in developed nations, including the U.S. Fitting conventional combustion technologies with CO<sub>2</sub> capture systems can carry an energy penalty of thirty percent or more, resulting in an increased price of power to the grid, as well as an overall decrease in net plant output. Taken together with the positive growth in demand for electricity, this implies a need for accelerated capital build-out in the power generation markets to accommodate both demand growth and decreased output at retrofitted plants. In this paper, the authors present the results of a study to assess the potential to use geothermal energy to provide boiler feedwater preheating, capturing efficiency improvements designed to offset the losses associated with CO<sub>2</sub> capture. Based on NETL benchmark cases and subsequent analysis of the application using site-specific data from the North Valmy power plant, several cases for CO<sub>2</sub> capture were evaluated. These included geothermally assisted MEA capture, CO2BOLs capture, and stand-alone hybrid power generation, compared with a baseline, no-geothermal case. Based on Case 10, and assuming 2.7 MMlb/h of geothermally sourced 150 ºC water, the parasitic power load associated with MEA capture could be offset by roughly seven percent, resulting in a small (~1 percent) overall loss to net power generation, but at levelized costs of electricity similar to the no-geothermal CCS case. For the CO<sub>2</sub>BOLs case, the availability of 150°C geothermal fluid could allow the facility to not only offset the net power decrease associated with CO<sub>2</sub>BOLs capture alone, but could increase nameplate capacity by two percent. The geothermally coupled CO<sub>2</sub>BOLs case also decreases LCOE by 0.75 ¢/kWh relative to the non-hybrid CO<sub>2</sub>BOLs case, with the improved performance over the MEA case driven by the lower regeneration temperature and associated duty for CO<sub>2</sub>BOLs relative to MEA.","Elsevier","","Pacific Northwest National Lab.

While their ability to provide critical services is well documented, microgrids present a more dynamic operational environment than grid-connected distribution systems. The electrodynamics of a microgrid are commonly driven by the high inertia of rotating generators, which are common in many microgrids. In such high-inertia systems, the impact of end-use load electromechanical dynamics are often not examined. However, with the increased penetration of inverter-based generation with little or no inertia, it is necessary to consider the impact that the dynamics of the end-use loads have on the operations of microgrids, particularly for a resiliency-based operation. These operations include, but are not limited to, switching operations, loss of generating units, and the starting of induction motors. This paper examines the importance of including multi-state electromechanical dynamic models of the end-use load when evaluating the operations of low inertia microgrids, and shows that by properly representing their behavior, it is possible to cost effectively size equipment while supporting resilient operations of critical end-use loads.","IEEE","","Pacific Northwest National Lab.

The selection of transformer winding connection is critical especially when the PV inverter has a reactive power controller. In general, transformer winding connection can be arranged in star-star (with neutral earthed) or star-delta. The reactive power controller supports voltage regulation of the power system particularly under transient faults. Its control strategy is based on utilizing the grid currents to make a three-phase reactive unbalanced current with a small gain. The gain is determined by the system impedance. Simulation results exhibit that the control strategy works very well particularly under disturbance conditions when the transformer winding connection is star-star with both neutrals grounded.

Particularly, the controllers update the power setpoints based on voltage measurements as well as given (time-varying) OPF targets, and entail elementary operations implementable onto low-cost microcontrollers that accompany power-electronics interfaces of gateways and inverters. The design of the control framework is based on suitable linear approximations of the AC power-flow equations as well as Lagrangian regularization methods. Convergence and OPF-target tracking capabilities of the controllers are analytically established.

This prompts a need for new simulation techniques that can simultaneously capture all the components of these large integrated smart grid systems. This paper describes a novel platform that combines three emerging research areas: power systems co-simulation, power hardware in the loop (PHIL) simulation, and lab-lab links. The platform is distributed, real-time capable, allows for easy internet-based connection from geographically-dispersed participants, and is software platform agnostic. We demonstrate its utility by studying real-time PHIL co-simulation of coordinated solar PV firming control of two inverters connected in multiple electric distribution network models, prototypical of U.S. and Australian systems.

This paper provides a formal approach to evaluate the operational resiliency of PDS, and quantify the resiliency of a system using a code-based metric. A combination of steady state and dynamic simulation tools is used to determine the resiliency metric. Dynamic simulation tools help with analyzing impact of short-term events, which might affect operational resiliency in long term. A dynamic optimization algorithm for changing operating criteria to increase the sustainability of the most critical loads has been proposed. The proposed theoretical approach is validated using a simple power distribution system model and simulation results demonstrate the ability to quantify the resiliency using the proposed code-based metric. The time-dependent quantification of resiliency has been demonstrated on a test system of two connected CERTS microgrids.","","","Idaho National Lab.

"An islanding detection methodology combining decision trees and Sandia frequency shift for inverter-based distributed generations","Azim, Riyasat; Li, Fangxing; Xue, Yaosuo; Starke, Michael; Wang, Honggang","24 POWER TRANSMISSION AND DISTRIBUTION; power generation economics; distributed power generation; power grids; pattern classification; power supply quality; decision trees; power system security; invertors; islanding detection methodology; power mismatch scenario; Sandia frequency shift technique; load quality factor","Distributed generations (DGs) for grid-connected applications require an accurate and reliable islanding detection methodology (IDM) for secure system operation. This paper presents an IDM for grid-connected inverter-based DGs. The proposed method is a combination of passive and active islanding detection techniques for aggregation of their advantages and elimination/minimisation of the drawbacks. In the proposed IDM, the passive method utilises critical system attributes extracted from local voltage measurements at target DG locations as well as employs decision tree-based classifiers for characterisation and detection of islanding events. The active method is based on Sandia frequency shift technique and is initiated only when the passive method is unable to differentiate islanding events from other system events. Thus, the power quality degradation introduced into the system by active islanding detection techniques can be minimised. Furthermore, a combination of active and passive techniques allows detection of islanding events under low power mismatch scenarios eliminating the disadvantage associated with the use of passive techniques alone. Finally, detailed case study results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method in detection of islanding events under various power mismatch scenarios, load quality factors and in the presence of single or multiple grid-connected inverter-based DG units.","Institution of Engineering and Technology","","Oak Ridge National Lab.

Technical issues associated with the restoration process are analyzed, including the operation of network protectors, inrush currents caused by the energization of network transformers, synchronization of DGs to the network, and circulating currents among DGs. A look-ahead load restoration framework is proposed, incorporating technical issues associated with secondary networks, limits on DG capacity and generation resources, dynamic constraints, and operational limits. The entire outage duration is divided into a sequence of periods. Restoration strategies can be adjusted at the beginning of each period using the latest information. Finally, numerical simulation of the modified IEEE 342-node low voltage networked test system is performed to validate the effectiveness of the proposed method.","IEEE","","Pacific Northwest National Lab.

RES units today represent a major share of the generation, and the traditional approach of integrating themas grid following units can lead to frequency instability. Many researchers have pointed towards using inverters with virtual inertia control algorithms so that they appear as synchronous generators to the grid, maintaining and enhancing system stability. Our paper presents a literature review of the current state-of-the-art of virtual inertia implementation techniques, and explores potential research directions and challenges. The major virtual inertia topologies are compared and classified. Through literature review and simulations of some selected topologies it has been shown that similar inertial response can be achieved by relating the parameters of these topologies through time constants and inertia constants, although the exact frequency dynamics may vary slightly. The suitability of a topology depends on system control architecture and desired level of detail in replication of the dynamics of synchronous generators. We present a discussion on the challenges and research directions which points out several research needs, especially for systems level integration of virtual inertia systems.","MDPI","","Idaho National Lab.

Twelve possible combinations of three WF level reactive power dispatch strategies and four Wind Turbine (WT) level reactive power control strategies are investigated. All of the combined strategies are formulated based on the comprehensive loss models of WFs, including the loss models of DFIGs, converters, filters, transformers, and cables of the collection system. Optimization problems are solved by a Modified Particle Swarm Optimization (MPSO) algorithm. The effectiveness of these strategies is evaluated by simulations on a carefully designed WF under a series of cases with different wind speeds and reactive power requirements of the WF. The wind speed at each WT inside the WF is calculated using the Jensen wake model. The results show that the best reactive power dispatch strategy for loss minimization comes when the WF level strategy and WT level control are coordinated and the losses from each device in the WF are considered in the objective.","MDPI AG","","National Renewable Energy Lab.

"How low can you go? The importance of quantifying minimum generation levels for renewable integration","Denholm, Paul; Brinkman, Greg; Mai, Trieu","17 WIND ENERGY; 24 POWER TRANSMISSION AND DISTRIBUTION; renewable integration; electricity planning; grid modeling; grid flexibility","One of the significant limitations of solar and wind deployment is declining value caused by the limited correlation of renewable energy supply and electricity demand as well as limited flexibility of the power system. Limited flexibility can result from thermal and hydro plants that cannot turn off or reduce output due to technical or economic limits. These limits include the operating range of conventional thermal power plants, the need for process heat from combined heat and power plants, and restrictions on hydro unit operation. To appropriately analyze regional and national energy policies related to renewable deployment, these limits must be accurately captured in grid planning models. In this work, we summarize data sources and methods for U.S. power plants that can be used to capture minimum generation levels in grid planning tools, such as production cost models. We also provide case studies for two locations in the U.S. (California and Texas) that demonstrate the sensitivity of variable generation (VG) curtailment to grid flexibility assumptions which shows the importance of analyzing (and documenting) minimum generation levels in studies of increased VG penetration.","Elsevier","","National Renewable Energy Lab.

Typically, simulations with a small time-step, 1 millisecond or less, are only run for a few seconds or a couple of minutes. While this trade-off has allowed for short duration simulations of large systems, it has prevented the complete analysis of power system phenomena that span minutes to hours, such as fault induced delayed voltage recovery. As power system operations become more complex with the deployment of new technologies, it will become more important to model dynamic behavior over greater time scales. This will include the ability to model system dynamics at the distribution level, including the end-use loads. This paper will present a computationally efficient method of adaptive dynamic simulations that enable transitions between time-series and dynamic modes, as necessary to capture system dynamics, while also being able to run for extended periods of time. This capability can support the direct analysis of dynamic events, co-simulation of transmission and distribution systems, and the development of reduced-order models.","IEEE","","SLAC National Accelerator Lab., Menlo Park, CA (United States); Pacific Northwest National Lab.

"A simulation-based efficiency comparison of AC and DC power distribution networks in commercial buildings","Gerber, Daniel L.; Vossos, Vagelis; Feng, Wei; Marnay, Chris; Nordman, Bruce; Brown, Richard","24 POWER TRANSMISSION AND DISTRIBUTION","Direct current (DC) power distribution has recently gained traction in buildings research due to the proliferation of on-site electricity generation and battery storage, and an increasing prevalence of internal DC loads. The research discussed in this paper uses Modelica-based simulation to compare the efficiency of DC building power distribution with an equivalent alternating current (AC) distribution. The buildings are all modeled with solar generation, battery storage, and loads that are representative of the most efficient building technology. A variety of paramet ric simulations determine how and when DC distribution proves advantageous. These simulations also validate previous studies that use simpler approaches and arithmetic efficiency models. This work shows that using DC distribution can be considerably more efficient: a medium sized office building using DC distribution has an expected baseline of 12% savings, but may also save up to 18%. In these results, the baseline simulation parameters are for a zero net energy (ZNE) building that can island as a microgrid. DC is most advantageous in buildings with large solar capacity, large battery capacity, and high voltage distribution.","Elsevier","","Lawrence Berkeley National Lab.

"Chance-Constrained AC Optimal Power Flow: Reformulations and Efficient Algorithms","Roald, Line Alnaes; Andersson, Goran","24 POWER TRANSMISSION AND DISTRIBUTION; 97 MATHEMATICS AND COMPUTING; Mathematics","Higher levels of renewable electricity generation increase uncertainty in power system operation. To ensure secure system operation, new tools that account for this uncertainty are required. Here, in this paper, we adopt a chance-constrained AC optimal power flow formulation, which guarantees that generation, power flows and voltages remain within their bounds with a pre-defined probability. We then discuss different chance-constraint reformulations and solution approaches for the problem. Additionally, we first discuss an analytical reformulation based on partial linearization, which enables us to obtain a tractable representation of the optimization problem. We then provide an efficient algorithm based on an iterative solution scheme which alternates between solving a deterministic AC OPF problem and assessing the impact of uncertainty. This more flexible computational framework enables not only scalable implementations, but also alternative chance-constraint reformulations. In particular, we suggest two sample based reformulations that do not require any approximation or relaxation of the AC power flow equations.","IEEE","","Los Alamos National Lab.

Recently with the increased integration of photovoltaics, the variable power output has led to increased voltage fluctuations and violation of operating limits. This study proposes an optimization model based on a recently developed heuristic search method, grey wolf optimization, to coordinate the various distribution controllers. Several different case studies on IEEE 33 and 69 bus test systems modified by including tap changing transformers, capacitors and photovoltaic solar panels are performed. Simulation results are compared to two other heuristic-based optimization methods: harmony search and differential evolution. Finally, the simulation results show the effectiveness of the method and indicate the usage of reactive power outputs of PVs facilitates better voltage magnitude profile.","Springer Nature","","Oak Ridge National Lab.

Tanks and pumps are optimally managed to satisfy water demand while improving power grid operations; {for the power network, an AC optimal power flow formulation is augmented to accommodate the controllability of water pumps.} Unfortunately, the physics governing the operation of the two infrastructures and coupling constraints lead to a nonconvex (and, in fact, NP-hard) problem; however, after reformulating OWPF as a nonconvex, quadratically-constrained quadratic problem, a feasible point pursuit-successive convex approximation approach is used to identify feasible and optimal solutions. In addition, a distributed solver based on the alternating direction method of multipliers enables water and power operators to pursue individual objectives while respecting the couplings between the two networks. The merits of the proposed approach are demonstrated for the case of a distribution feeder coupled with a municipal water distribution network.","IEEE","","National Renewable Energy Lab.

"Chemical Sensing Strategies for Real-Time Monitoring of Transformer Oil: A Review","Sun, Chenhu; Ohodnicki, Paul R.; Stewart, Emma M.","24 POWER TRANSMISSION AND DISTRIBUTION; 37 INORGANIC, ORGANIC, PHYSICAL, AND ANALYTICAL CHEMISTRY","Power transformers are a central component in the field of energy distribution and transmission. The early recognition of incipient faults in operating transformers is substantially cost effective by lessening impromptu blackouts. A standout amongst the most responsive and dependable strategies utilized for assessing the health of oil filled electrical equipment is dissolved gas analysis (DGA). Nowadays, there is an expanding requirement for better nonintrusive diagnostic and online monitoring tools to survey the internal state of the transformers. Chemical sensors are viewed as a key innovation for condition monitoring of transformer health, coordinating the non-invasiveness with typical sensor features, such as cost, usability, portability, and the integration with the data networks. Low-cost chemical sensors-based DGA techniques are expected to drastically augment the diagnostic abilities empowering the deployment on a broader range of oil filled power assets. The recent development involves both specific sensors designed to detect individual dissolved gas in transformer oil and non-specific sensors, operated in near ambient conditions, with the potential to be applied in a DGA system. In this paper, general background and operating guidelines of DGA are presented to address the origin of the gas formation, methods for their detection and the interpretation of the results by data analytics. The recent significant interest and advancements in chemical sensors to DGA applications are reviewed. Lastly, future research perspectives and challenges for the development of novel DGA chemical sensors are also discussed.","IEEE","","National Energy Technology Lab.

Voltage unbalance and other key performance indicators including voltage magnitudes, line loading, and energy losses are used to characterize and demonstrate the technical value of optimizing system topology on a per-phase basis in response to feeder conditions. The near-optimal per-phase topology control is defined as a series of hierarchical optimization problems. The proposed approach is respectively applied to IEEE 13-bus and 123-bus test systems for demonstration, which included the impact of integrating electric vehicles (EVs) in the test circuit. It is concluded that the proposed approach can be effectively leveraged to improve voltage profiles with electric vehicles, the extent of which depends upon the performance of the base case without EVs.","IEEE","","National Renewable Energy Lab.

As a result of the energy transition, technological advances, and the scientific interest in distributed control and optimization methods, a plethora of distributed frequency control strategies have been proposed recently that rely on communication amongst local controllers. In this paper we propose a fully decentralized leaky integral controller for frequency restoration that is derived from a classic lag element. We study steady-state, asymptotic optimality, nominal stability, input-to-state stability, noise rejection, transient performance, and robustness properties of this controller in closed loop with a nonlinear and multivariable power system model. Here, we demonstrate that the leaky integral controller can strike an acceptable trade-off between performance and robustness as well as between asymptotic disturbance rejection and transient convergence rate by tuning its DC gain and time constant. We compare our findings to conventional decentralized integral control and distributed- averaging-based integral control in theory and simulations.","IEEE","","National Renewable Energy Lab.

When a power grid is under attack, the detection delay, which is defined as the time difference between the occurrence and detection of the attack, is critical to power grid operations. A shorter detection delay can shorten the response time, thus prevent catastrophic impacts from the attack. The objective of this paper is to develop low-latency false data detection algorithms that can minimize the detection delay subject to constraints on false alarm probability. The false data injection can be modeled with a sparse attack vector, with each non-zero element corresponding to one meter under attack. Since neither the support nor the values of the sparse attack vector is known, a new orthogonal matching pursuit cumulative sum (OMP-CUSUM) algorithm is proposed to identify the meters under attack while minimizing the detection delay. In order to recover the support of the sparse vector, we develop a new stopping condition for the iterative OMP algorithm by analyzing the statistical properties of the power grid measurements. Theoretical analysis and simulation results show that the proposed OMP-CUSUM algorithm can efficiently identify the meters under attack, and reliably detect false data injections with low delays while maintaining good detection accuracy.","Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers","","Univ. of Arkansas, Little Rock, AR (United States)","USDOE","","United States","2018-01-01T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: IEEE Access Journal Volume: 6","","Medium: X; Size: p. 58564-58573","","","OE0000779; ECCS-1405403; ECCS-1711087","Journal ID: ISSN 2169-3536; 8485421","10.1109/ACCESS.2018.2873981","","2022-01-13T00:00:00Z","1482403","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/1482403","","IEEE Access","","6"

The converter configuration replaces the conventional bulky line frequency transformer with several high frequency transformers, potentially reducing the balance of systems cost of PV systems. The front-end converter for each port is a neutral-point diode clamped (NPC) multi-level dc-dc dual-active bridge (ML-DAB) which allows maximum power point tracking (MPPT). The integrated high frequency transformer provides the galvanic isolation between the PV and grid side and also steps up the low dc voltage from PV source. Following the ML-DAB stage, in each port, is a NPC inverter. N number of NPC inverters’ outputs are cascaded to attain the per-phase line-to-neutral voltage to connect directly to the distribution grid (i.e., 13.8 kV). The cascaded NPC (CNPC) inverters have the inherent advantage of using lower rated devices, smaller filters and low total harmonic distortion required for PV grid interconnection. The proposed converter system is modular, scalable, and serviceable with zero downtime with lower foot print and lower overall cost. A novel voltage balance control at each module based on power mismatch among N-ports, have been presented and verified in simulation.

An effective restoration methodology is desired to optimally integrate emerging smart grid technologies and pave the way for developing self-healing smart grids. In this paper, a sequential service restoration (SSR) framework is proposed to generate restoration solutions for distribution systems and microgrids in the event of large-scale power outages. The restoration solution contains a sequence of control actions that properly coordinate switches, distributed generators, and switchable loads to form multiple isolated microgrids. The SSR can be applied for three-phase unbalanced distribution systems and microgrids and can adapt to various operation conditions. Mathematical models are introduced for three-phase unbalanced power flow, voltage regulators, transformers, and loads. Furthermore, the SSR problem is formulated as a mixed-integer linear programming model, and its effectiveness is evaluated via the modified IEEE 123 node test feeder.","IEEE","","Argonne National Lab.

The presence of remote control switches (RCSs), distributed generators (DGs), and energy storage systems (ESS) provides both challenges and opportunities for developing post-fault service restoration methodologies. Inter-temporal constraints of DGs, ESS, and loads under cold load pickup (CLPU) conditions impose extra complexity on problem formulation and solution. In this paper, a multi-time step service restoration methodology is proposed to optimally generate a sequence of control actions for controllable switches, ESSs, and dispatchable DGs to assist the system operator with decision making. The restoration sequence is determined to minimize the unserved customers by energizing the system step by step without violating operational constraints at each time step. The proposed methodology is formulated as a mixed-integer linear programming (MILP) model and can adapt to various operation conditions. Furthermore, the proposed method is validated through several case studies that are performed on modified IEEE 13-node and IEEE 123-node test feeders.","IEEE","","Argonne National Lab.

An elitist genetic algorithm combined with a hierarchical clustering and a Thevenin network reduction is implemented to compute strategic locations and aggregate demand within each area. The aggregation reduces large distribution networks having thousands of nodes to an equivalent network with few aggregated loads, thereby significantly reducing the computational burden. Furthermore, it not only helps distribution system operators in making faster operational decisions by understanding during which time of the day will be in need of flexibility, from which specific area, and in which amount, but also enables the flexibilities stemming from small distributed resources to be traded in various power/energy markets. A combination of central and local aggregation scheme where a central aggregator enables market participation, while local aggregators materialize the accepted bids, is implemented to realize this concept. The effectiveness of the proposed method is evaluated by comparing network performances with and without aggregation. Finally, for a given network configuration, steady-state performance of aggregated network is significantly accurate (≈ ±1.5% error) compared to very high errors associated with forecast of individual consumer demand.","Elsevier","","Idaho National Lab.

This has an impact on the private investments in distributed energy resources (DER), since it occurs exactly when the PV prices are becoming attractive, and the opportunity to an energy transition based on solar technologies is being wasted. In particular, this limitation of the networks is a barrier for larger consumers, such as commercial and public buildings, aiming at investing in PV capacity and start operating as microgrids connected to the MV network. To address this challenge, this paper presents a coordinated approach to the microgrid investment and planning problem, where the system operator and the microgrid owner collaborate to improve the voltage control capabilities of the distribution network, increasing the PV potential. The results prove that this collaboration has the benefit of increasing the value of the microgrid investments while improving the quality of service of the system and it should be considered in the future regulatory framework.","Elsevier","","Lawrence Berkeley National Lab.

The impact of stochastic continuous disturbances on power system transient stability attracts significant attention. To address this problem, this paper proposes an analytical assessment method for transient stability of multi-machine power systems under stochastic continuous disturbances. In the proposed method, a probability measure of transient stability is presented and analytically solved by stochastic averaging. Compared with the conventional method (Monte Carlo simulation), the proposed method is many orders of magnitude faster, which makes it very attractive in practice when many plans for transient stability must be compared or when transient stability must be analyzed quickly. Also, it is found that the evolution of system energy over time is almost a simple diffusion process by the proposed method, which explains the impact mechanism of stochastic continuous disturbances on transient stability in theory.","IEEE","","Oak Ridge National Lab.

This paper presents a review on load modeling and identification techniques. Load models can be classified into two broad categories: static and dynamic models, while there are two types of approaches to identify model parameters: measurement-based and component-based. Load modeling has received more attention in recent years because of the renewable integration, demand-side management, and smart metering devices. However, the commonly used load models are outdated, and cannot represent emerging loads. There is a need to systematically review existing load modeling techniques and suggest future research directions to meet the increasing interests from industry and academia.

The inevitable high dimensionality and nonlinearity of first-principles dynamic process models makes incorporating them in scheduling calculations challenging. In this work, we describe a general framework for deriving data-driven surrogate models of the closed-loop process dynamics. Focusing on Hammerstein–Wiener and finite step response (FSR) model forms, we show that these models can be (exactly) linearized and embedded in production scheduling calculations. The resulting scheduling problems are mixed-integer linear programs with a special structure, which we exploit in a novel and efficient solution strategy. A polymerization reactor case study is utilized to demonstrate the merits of this method. Finally, our framework compares favorably to existing approaches that embed dynamics in scheduling calculations, showing considerable reductions in computational effort.","Elsevier","","Univ. of Texas, Austin, TX (United States); Univ. of Texas at Austin, TX (United States)","USDOE Office of Electricity (OE); National Science Foundation (NSF)","","United States","2017-11-28T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: Computers and Chemical Engineering; Journal Volume: 110; Journal Issue: C","","Medium: ED; Size: p. 35-52","","","OE0000841","Journal ID: ISSN 0098-1354","10.1016/j.compchemeng.2017.11.021","","2020-04-27T00:00:00Z","1605935","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/1605935","https://www.osti.gov/servlets/purl/1605935","Computers and Chemical Engineering","C","110"

This paper proposes a power-smoothing scheme of a doubly-fed induction generator (DFIG) that significantly mitigates the system frequency fluctuation while preventing over-deceleration of the rotor speed. The proposed scheme employs an additional control loop relying on the system frequency deviation that operates in combination with the maximum power point tracking control loop. To improve the power-smoothing capability while preventing over-deceleration of the rotor speed, the gain of the additional loop is modified with the rotor speed and frequency deviation. The gain is set to be high if the rotor speed and/or frequency deviation is large. In conclusion, the simulation results based on the IEEE 14-bus system clearly demonstrate that the proposed scheme significantly lessens the output power fluctuation of a WPP under various scenarios by modifying the gain with the rotor speed and frequency deviation, and thereby it can regulate the frequency deviation within a narrow range.","MDPI AG","","National Renewable Energy Lab.

Our multicriteria assessment of wind and solar potential for large regions of Africa shows how economically competitive and low-environmental– impact renewable resources can significantly contribute to meeting this demand. We created the Multicriteria Analysis for Planning Renewable Energy (MapRE) framework to map and characterize solar and wind energy zones in 21 countries in the Southern African Power Pool (SAPP) and the Eastern Africa Power Pool (EAPP) and find that potential is several times greater than demand in many countries. Significant fractions of demand can be quickly served with “no-regrets” options—or zones that are low-cost, low-environmental impact, and highly accessible. Because no-regrets options are spatially heterogeneous, international interconnections are necessary to help achieve low-carbon development for the region as a whole, and interconnections that support the best renewable options may differ from those planned for hydropower expansion. Additionally, interconnections and selecting wind sites to match demand reduce the need for SAPP-wide conventional generation capacity by 9.5% in a high-wind scenario, resulting in a 6–20% cost savings, depending on the avoided conventional technology. Strategic selection of low-impact and accessible zones is more cost effective with interconnections compared with solutions without interconnections. In conclusion, the overall results are robust to multiple load growth scenarios. Together, results show that multicriteria site selection and deliberate planning of interconnections may significantly increase the economic and environmental competitiveness of renewable alternatives relative to conventional generation.","National Academy of Sciences, Washington, DC (United States)","","Lawrence Berkeley National Lab.

"Reducing Cascading Failure Risk by Increasing Infrastructure Network Interdependence","Korkali, Mert; Veneman, Jason G.; Tivnan, Brian F.; Bagrow, James P.; Hines, Paul D. H.","42 ENGINEERING; 24 POWER TRANSMISSION AND DISTRIBUTION; 29 ENERGY PLANNING, POLICY AND ECONOMY; 97 MATHEMATICS AND COMPUTING; Complex networks; Computational science; Energy grids and networks","Increased coupling between critical infrastructure networks, such as power and communication systems, has important implications for the reliability and security of these systems. To understand the effects of power-communication coupling, several researchers have studied models of interdependent networks and reported that increased coupling can increase vulnerability. However, these conclusions come largely from models that have substantially different mechanisms of cascading failure, relative to those found in actual power and communication networks, and that do not capture the benefits of connecting systems with complementary capabilities. In order to understand the importance of these details, this paper compares network vulnerability in simple topological models and in models that more accurately capture the dynamics of cascading in power systems. First, we compare a simple model of topological contagion to a model of cascading in power systems and find that the power grid model shows a higher level of vulnerability, relative to the contagion model. Second, we compare a percolation model of topological cascading in coupled networks to three different models of power networks coupled to communication systems. Again, the more accurate models suggest very different conclusions than the percolation model. In all but the most extreme case, the physics-based power grid models indicate that increased power-communication coupling decreases vulnerability. This is opposite from what one would conclude from the percolation model, in which zero coupling is optimal.

It is supported by theory and experience. Over the past 25 years, wind and solar generation has undergone dramatic growth, resulting in a variety of experiences that model the integration of wind and solar into the planning and operation of modern electric power systems.

The charging process is modeled as a dynamic linear program instead of the normal day-ahead and real-time regulation strategy, to capture the advantages of both global and real-time optimization. Different from conventional price forecasting algorithms, a dynamic price vector formation model is proposed based on a clustering algorithm to form an RTP vector for a particular day. A dynamic feasible energy demand region (DFEDR) model considering grid voltage profiles is designed to calculate the lower and upper bounds. A deduction method is proposed to deal with the unknown information of future intervals, such as the actual stochastic arrival and departure times of EVs, which make the DFEDR model suitable for global optimization. Finally, both the comparative cases articulate the advantages of the developed methods and the validity in reducing electricity costs, mitigating peak charging demand, and improving PV self-consumption of the proposed strategy are verified through simulation scenarios.","IEEE","","National Renewable Energy Lab.

"Adaptive Gain-based Stable Power Smoothing of a DFIG","Muljadi, Eduard; Lee, Hyewon; Hwang, Min; Lee, Jinsik; Jung, Hong -Ju; Kang, Yong Cheol","24 POWER TRANSMISSION AND DISTRIBUTION; frequency deviation; kinetic energy; power fluctuation; power smoothing; rotor speed; and stable operation","In a power system that has a high wind penetration, the output power fluctuation of a large-scale wind turbine generator (WTG) caused by the varying wind speed increases the maximum frequency deviation, which is an important metric to assess the quality of electricity, because of the reduced system inertia. This paper proposes a stable power-smoothing scheme of a doubly-fed induction generator (DFIG) that can suppress the maximum frequency deviation, particularly for a power system with a high wind penetration. To do this, the proposed scheme employs an additional control loop relying on the system frequency deviation that operates in combination with the maximum power point tracking control loop. To improve the power-smoothing capability while guaranteeing the stable operation of a DFIG, the gain of the additional loop is modified with the rotor speed and frequency deviation. The gain is set to be high if the rotor speed and/or frequency deviation is large. Here, the simulation results based on the IEEE 14-bus system demonstrate that the proposed scheme significantly lessens the output power fluctuation of a WTG under various scenarios by modifying the gain with the rotor speed and frequency deviation, and thereby it can regulate the frequency deviation within a narrow range.","Korean Institute of Electrical Engineers","","National Renewable Energy Lab.

"Ensemble Kalman Filter for Dynamic State Estimation of Power Grids Stochastically Driven by Time-correlated Mechanical Input Power","Rosenthal, William Steven; Tartakovsky, Alex; Huang, Zhenyu","24 POWER TRANSMISSION AND DISTRIBUTION; Power system estimation; power system dynamics; wind power generation; time-correlation; stochastic processes; stochastic resonance; ensemble Kalman filter; filter divergence; parameter estimation","State and parameter estimation of power transmission networks is important for monitoring power grid operating conditions and analyzing transient stability. Wind power generation depends on fluctuating input power levels, which are correlated in time and contribute to uncertainty in turbine dynamical models. The ensemble Kalman filter (EnKF), a standard state estimation technique, uses a deterministic forecast and does not explicitly model time-correlated noise in parameters such as mechanical input power. However, this uncertainty affects the probability of fault-induced transient instability and increased prediction bias. Here a novel approach is to model input power noise with time-correlated stochastic fluctuations, and integrate them with the network dynamics during the forecast. While the EnKF has been used to calibrate constant parameters in turbine dynamical models, the calibration of a statistical model for a time-correlated parameter has not been investigated. In this study, twin experiments on a standard transmission network test case are used to validate our time-correlated noise model framework for state estimation of unsteady operating conditions and transient stability analysis, and a methodology is proposed for the inference of the mechanical input power time-correlation length parameter using time-series data from PMUs monitoring power dynamics at generator buses.","IEEE","","Pacific Northwest National Lab.

The conventional voltage regulation devices limited by the physical constraints are difficult to meet the requirement of real-time voltage and VAR control (VVC) with high precision when DGs fluctuate frequently. But, soft open point (SOP), a flexible power electronic device, can be used as the continuous reactive power source to realize the fast voltage regulation. Considering the cooperation of SOP and multiple regulation devices, this paper proposes a coordinated VVC method based on SOP for ADNs. Firstly, a time-series model of coordi-nated VVC is developed to minimize operation costs and eliminate voltage violations of ADNs. Then, by applying the linearization and conic relaxation, the original nonconvex mixed-integer non-linear optimization model is converted into a mixed-integer second-order cone programming (MISOCP) model which can be efficiently solved to meet the requirement of voltage regulation rapidity.

The negligence of the strong coupling due to power lines impedance leads to large transient line currents, which might trigger false protection. Besides, the droop-based control methods unnecessarily introduce system frequency and voltage deviations. To overcome these issues, a novel distributed control scheme is proposed for the inverter-interfaced microgrids in this study. The objective of the primary control is to regulate the bus voltages and frequency while suppressing the transient line currents. The objective of secondary control is to maintain fair load sharing. Both primary control and secondary control are distributed and subsystems or control agents only require measurements from local and neighboring subsystems. The detailed control problem formulation, control design and stability analysis are presented in the paper. Finally, the effectiveness of the proposed control solution is evaluated through extensive simulations based on both simplified and detailed models.","IEEE","","Oak Ridge National Lab.

Two distinct inertial control (IC) methods are analysed in terms of their impacts on the grids and the response of the turbine itself. The released kinetic energy in the IC methods are determined by the frequency measurement or shaped active power reference in the turbine speed-power plane. The wind turbine model is based on the high-fidelity turbine simulator fatigue, aerodynamic, structures and turbulence, which constitutes the aggregated wind power plant model with the simplified power converter model. The IC methods are implemented over the baseline CART3 controller, evaluated in the modified 9-bus and 14-bus testing power grids considering different wind speeds and different wind power penetration levels.

The proposed algorithm affords an online implementation to enable tracking of the solutions in the presence of time-varying operational conditions and changing optimization objectives. It involves a strategy where the network operator collects voltage measurements throughout the feeder to build incentive signals for the DER-owners in real time; DERs then adjust the generated/consumed powers in order to avoid the violation of the voltage constraints while maximizing given objectives.

"Fast and self-learning indoor airflow simulation based on in situ adaptive tabulation","Tian, Wei; Sevilla, Thomas Alonso; Li, Dan; Zuo, Wangda; Wetter, Michael","24 POWER TRANSMISSION AND DISTRIBUTION; in situ adaptive tabulation; fast fluid dynamics; reduced order model; self-learning; indoor airflow simulation","Fast simulation for stratified indoor airflow distributions is desired for various applications, such as design of advanced indoor environments, emergency management, and coupled annual energy simulation for buildings with stratified air distributions. Reduced order models trained by pre-computed computational fluid dynamics results are fast, but their prediction may be inaccurate when applied for conditions outside the training domain. To overcome this limitation, we propose in this paper a fast and self-learning model based on an in situ adaptive tabulation (ISAT) algorithm, which is trained by a fast fluid dynamics (FFD) model as an example. The idea is that the ISAT will retrieve the solutions from an existing data set if the estimated prediction error is within a pre-defined tolerance. Otherwise, the ISAT will execute the FFD simulation, which is accelerated by running in parallel on a graphics processing unit, for a full-scale simulation. This paper systematically investigates the feasibility of the ISAT for indoor airflow simulations by presenting the ISAT-FFD implementation alongside results related to its overall performance. Using a stratified indoor airflow as an example, we evaluated how the training time of ISAT was impacted by four factors (training methods, error tolerances, number of inputs, and number of outputs). Then we demonstrated that a trained ISAT model can predict the key information for inputs both inside and outside the training domain. The ISAT was able to answer query points both inside and close to training domain using retrieve actions within a time less than 0.001 s for each query. In conclusion, we provided suggestions for using the ISAT for building applications.","Taylor & Francis","","Lawrence Berkeley National Lab.

The proposed approach contains two major steps: the first step is big data analysis of wide-area monitoring to detect a UMI and locate it; the second step is particle swarm optimization (PSO)-based stability enhancement for the UMI. First, an optimal synchrophasor measurement device selection (OSMDS) and matching pursuit decomposition (MPD)-based spatial-temporal analysis approach is proposed to significantly reduce the volume of data while keeping appropriate information from the synchrophasor measurements. Second, a random forest-based ensemble learning approach is trained to detect the UMI. When combined with grid topology, the UMI can be located. Then the stability problem of the UMI is formulated as an optimization problem and the PSO is used to find the optimal operational parameters of the UMI. An eigenvalue-based multiobjective function is proposed, which aims to improve the damping and dynamic characteristics of the UMI.

We examine spatial and temporal variations in generation mix across the region and year using the PLEXOS unit commitment and dispatch model with a production cost model database adapted from the Western Electricity Coordinating Council. Emissions estimates are computed by combining the dispatch model results with unit-specific, emissions-load relationships. Wind energy displaces natural gas and coal in scenarios with relatively expensive natural gas or with GHG fees. Correspondingly, annual emissions of NOx, SO2, and CO2 are reduced by 20-40% in these cases. NOx emissions, which are a concern as a precursor of ground-level ozone, are relatively high and consistent across scenarios during summer, when peak electricity loads occur and wind resources in the region are comparatively weak. Accounting for the difference in start-up versus stabilized NOx emissions rates for natural gas plants had little impact on region-wide emissions estimates due to the dominant contribution from coal-fired plants, but would be more important in the vicinity of the natural gas units.","Elsevier","","National Renewable Energy Lab.

Given parameters such as start-up and shut-down penalties, expected electricity price profiles, solar availability, and system interoperability requirements, this paper seeks a profit-maximizing solution that determines start-up and shut-down times for the power cycle and solar receiver, and the times at which to dispatch stored and instantaneous quantities of energy over a 48-h horizon at hourly fidelity. The mixed-integer linear program (MIP) is subject to constraints including: (i) minimum and maximum rates of start-up and shut-down, (ii) energy balance, including energetic state of the system as a whole and its components, (iii) logical rules governing the operational modes of the power cycle and solar receiver, and (iv) operational consistency between time periods. The novelty in this work lies in the successful integration of a dispatch optimization model into a detailed techno-economic analysis tool, specifically, the National Renewable Energy Laboratory's System Advisor Model (SAM). The MIP produces an optimized operating strategy, historically determined via a heuristic. Using several market electricity pricing profiles, we present comparative results for a system with and without dispatch optimization, indicating that dispatch optimization can improve plant profitability by 5-20% and thereby alter the economics of concentrating solar power technology. While we examine a molten salt power tower system, this analysis is equally applicable to the more mature concentrating solar parabolic trough system with thermal energy storage.","Elsevier","","National Renewable Energy Lab.

The side-by-side drivers can be directly wire bonded to the VCSEL diode array, supporting up to 4 channels. To increase the bandwidth of the driver, an internal feed-forward path is added for pole-zero cancellation, without increasing the power consumption. An edge-configurable pre-emphasis technique is proposed to achieve high bandwidth and minimize the asymmetry of the fall and rise times of the driver output current. Measurement results demonstrate a RMS jitter of 0.68 ps for 10 Gb/s operation. Tests demonstrate negligible crosstalk between channels. Under irradiation, the modulation amplitude degrades less than 5% up to 300 Mrad ionizing dose. Finally, the area of the quaddriver array is 500 μm by 1000 μm and the total power consumption for the entire driver array chip is 130 mW for the typical current setting.","IEEE","","Southern Methodist Univ., Dallas, TX (United States)","USDOE","","United States","2017-05-08T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: IEEE Transactions on Nuclear Science; Journal Volume: 64; Journal Issue: 6","","Medium: ED; Size: p. 1599-1604","","","SC0007830","Journal ID: ISSN 0018-9499; TRN: US1702206","10.1109/TNS.2017.2702064","","2021-07-23T00:00:00Z","1374395","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/1374395","https://www.osti.gov/servlets/purl/1374395","IEEE Transactions on Nuclear Science","6","64"

The mechanism of this issue is analyzed, and then a solution based on fundamental-frequency reactive circulating current (FFRCC) injection is proposed. The influence of FFRCC injection is analyzed in terms of the fluctuated arm capacitor energy and the current stress of semiconductors.

The technique involves repeatedly solving the load-flow problem for a distribution system model and is useful for distributed energy resource (DER) planning. When a QSTS simulation has a small time step and a long duration, the computational burden of the simulation can be a barrier to integration into utility workflows. One way to relieve the computational burden is to simplify the system model. The segment substitution method of simplifying distribution system models introduced in this paper offers model bus reduction of up to 98% with a simplification error as low as 0.2% (0.002 pu voltage). Finally, in contrast to existing methods of distribution system model simplification, which rely on topological inspection and linearization, the segment substitution method uses black-box segment data and an assumed simplified topology.","IEEE","","Pacific Northwest National Lab.

The performance of OPF solution techniques strongly depends on the problem’s feasible space. This paper presents an algorithm that is guaranteed to compute the entire feasible spaces of small OPF problems to within a specified discretization tolerance. Specifically, the feasible space is computed by discretizing certain of the OPF problem’s inequality constraints to obtain a set of power flow equations. All solutions to the power flow equations at each discretization point are obtained using the Numerical Polynomial Homotopy Continuation (NPHC) algorithm. To improve computational tractability, “bound tightening” and “grid pruning” algorithms use convex relaxations to preclude consideration of many discretization points that are infeasible for the OPF problem. Here, the proposed algorithm is used to generate the feasible spaces of two small test cases.","IEEE","","Argonne National Lab.

In this study, we develop a data-driven two-stage stochastic transmission expansion planning with uncertainties. In the proposed approach, purely by learning from the historical data, we first construct a confidence set for the unknown distribution of the uncertain parameters. Then, we develop a two-stage data-driven transmission expansion framework, by considering the worst-case distribution within the constructed confidence set, so as to provide a reliable while economic transmission planning decision. Furthermore, to tackle the model complexity, we propose a decomposition framework embedded with Benders' and Column-and-Constraint generation methods.

The proposed method hinges on a chance-constrained AC OPF formulation where probabilistic constraints are utilized to enforce voltage regulation with prescribed probability. A computationally more affordable convex reformulation is developed by resorting to suitable linear approximations of the AC power-flow equations as well as convex approximations of the chance constraints. The approximate chance constraints provide conservative bounds that hold for arbitrary distributions of the forecasting errors. An adaptive strategy is then obtained by embedding the proposed AC OPF task into a model predictive control framework. Finally, a distributed solver is developed to strategically distribute the solution of the optimization problems across utility and customers.","IEEE","","National Renewable Energy Lab.

First, the EV charging problem from consumer, aggregator, and grid operator’s perspective is investigated.

This is realized by integrating a multi-time scale control, which works from a day-ahead scheduling up to real-time adaptive control. The performance of the developed method is investigated with high EV penetration in a typical distribution network. The simulation results demonstrates that HCA exploit EV flexibility to solve grid unbalancing and congestions with simultaneous maximization of economic benefits by ensuring EV participation to day-ahead, balancing, and regulation markets. For the given network configuration and pricing structure, HCA ensures the EV owners to get paid up to 5 times the cost they were paying without control.","MDPI AG","","Idaho National Lab.

Unlike traditional synchronized frequency measurement devices, which rely on potential transformers and current transformers physically connected to system elements, a WEFS is used to realize wireless signal acquisition in the vicinity of any HV apparatus. The MES performs real-time frequency estimation using a recursive discrete Fourier transform based algorithm. Network time protocol (NTP) is used for time synchronization, increasing the system flexibility by eliminating global positioning system reliance. An NTP-based synchronized sampling control method is proposed and implemented in MES to compensate the sampling time error caused by local time drift and division residue. The proposed system has the advantages of portability and lower cost, making it highly accessible and useful for a wide array of synchronized frequency measurement applications. Experiment results verify the accuracy and effectiveness of the proposed system.","IEEE","","Oak Ridge National Lab.

"Synchrophasor Data Correction under GPS Spoofing Attack: A State Estimation Based Approach","Fan, Xiaoyuan; Du, Liang; Duan, Dongliang","24 POWER TRANSMISSION AND DISTRIBUTION; phasor measurement units; global positioning system; synchronization; state estimation; current measurement; power grids; voltage measurement","GPS spoofing attack (GSA) has been shown to be one of the most imminent threats to almost all cyber-physical systems incorporated with the civilian GPS signal. Specifically, for our current agenda of the modernization of the power grid, this may greatly jeopardize the benefits provided by the pervasively installed phasor measurement units (PMU). In this study, we consider the case where synchrophasor data from PMUs are compromised due to the presence of a single GSA, and show that it can be corrected by signal processing techniques. In particular, we introduce a statistical model for synchrophasorbased power system state estimation (SE), and then derive the spoofing-matched algorithms for synchrophasor data correction against GPS spoofing attack. Different testing scenarios in IEEE 14-, 30-, 57-, 118-bus systems are simulated to show the proposed algorithms’ performance on GSA detection and state estimation. Numerical results demonstrate that our proposed algorithms can consistently locate and correct the spoofed synchrophasor data with good accuracy as long as the system observability is satisfied. Finally, the accuracy of state estimation is significantly improved compared with the traditional weighted least square method and approaches the performance under the Genie-aided method.","IEEE","","Pacific Northwest National Lab.

We present a case study to show how this methodology is applied to a multi-use/ multi-function telecommunications facility in southern California. In the case study, we first identify photovoltaic (PV) and battery energy storage system (BESS) technologies that minimize the lifecycle cost of energy at the site under normal, grid-connected operation. We then evaluate how those technologies could be incorporated alongside existing diesel generators in a microgrid to increase resiliency at the site, where resiliency is quantified in terms of the amount of time that the microgrid can sustain the critical load during a grid outage. We find that adding PV and BESS to the existing backup diesel generators with a fixed fuel supply extends the amount of time the site could survive an outage by 1.8 days, from 1.7 days for the existing diesel-only backup system to 3.5 days for the PV/diesel/BESS hybrid system. Furthermore, even after diesel fuel supplies are exhausted, the site can continue to operate critical loads during daytime hours using just the PV/BESS when there is sufficient solar resource. We find that the site can save approximately 100,000 dollars in energy costs over the 25-year lifecycle while doubling the amount of time they can survive an outage. Here, the methodology presented here provides a template for increasing resiliency at telecomm sites by implementing renewable energy solutions, which provide additional benefits of carbon emission reduction and energy cost savings.","Emerald Publishing Ltd.","","National Renewable Energy Lab.

Light, strong, high-conductivity materials are desirable for this application to reduce both construction and operational costs. In this study an Al/Ca (11.5% vol.) composite with nano-filamentary reinforcement was produced by powder metallurgy then extruded, swaged, and wire drawn to a maximum true strain of 12.7. The tensile strength increased exponentially as the filament size was reduced to the sub-micron level. In an effort to improve the conductor's ability to operate at elevated temperatures, the deformation-processed wires were heat-treated at 260°C to transform the Ca-reinforcing filaments to Al<sub>2</sub>Ca. In conclusion, such a transformation raised the tensile strength by as much as 28%, and caused little change in ductility, while the electrical conductivity was reduced by only 1% to 3%. Al/Al<sub>2</sub>Ca composites are compared to existing conductor materials to show how implementation could affect installation and performance.","IOP Publishing","","Ames Lab., Ames, IA (United States)","USDOE","","United States","2017-08-01T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: IOP Conference Series.

WAMPAC relies heavily on the security of measurements and control commands transmitted over wide-area communication networks for real-time operational, protection, and control functions. Also, the current “N-1 security criteria” for grid operation is inadequate to address malicious cyber events and therefore it is important to fundamentally redesign WAMPAC and to enhance Energy Management System (EMS) applications to make them attack-resilient. In this paper, we propose an end-to-end defense-in-depth architecture for attack-resilient WAMPAC that addresses resilience at both the infrastructure layer and the application layers. Also, we propose an attack-resilient cyber-physical security framework that encompasses the entire security life cycle including risk assessment, attack prevention, attack detection, attack mitigation, and attack resilience. The overarching objective of this paper is to provide a broad scope that comprehensively describes most of the major research issues and potential solutions in the context of cyber-physical security of WAMPAC for the power grid.","Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers","","Pacific Northwest National Lab.

The proposed scheme employs an additional loop based on the system frequency deviation that operates in conjunction with the maximum power point tracking (MPPT) control loop. Unlike the conventional, fixed-gain scheme, its control gain is modified with the rotor speed. In the proposed scheme, the control gain is determined by considering the ratio of the output of the additional loop to that of the MPPT loop. To improve the contribution of the scheme toward maintaining the frequency while ensuring the stable operation of WTGs, in the low rotor speed region, the ratio is set to be proportional to the rotor speed; in the high rotor speed region, the ratio remains constant. The performance of the proposed scheme is investigated under varying wind conditions for the IEEE 14-bus system. The simulation results demonstrate that the scheme successfully operates regardless of the output power fluctuation of a WTG by adjusting the gain with the rotor speed, and thereby improves the frequency-regulating capability of a WTG.","IEEE","","National Renewable Energy Lab.

However, wind is generally thought of as causing the need for ramping services, not as being a potential source for the service. In this paper, a multi-timescale unit commitment and economic dispatch model is developed to consider the wind power ramping product (WPRP). An optimized swinging door algorithm with dynamic programming is applied to identify and forecast wind power ramps (WPRs). Designed as positive characteristics of WPRs, the WPRP is then integrated into the multi-timescale dispatch model that considers new objective functions, ramping capacity limits, active power limits, and flexible ramping requirements. Numerical simulations on the modified IEEE 118-bus system show the potential effectiveness of WPRP in increasing the economic efficiency of power system operations with high levels of wind power penetration. It is found that WPRP not only reduces the production cost by using less ramping reserves scheduled by conventional generators, but also possibly enhances the reliability of power system operations. Moreover, wind power forecasts play an important role in providing high-quality WPRP service.","IEEE","","National Renewable Energy Lab.

Weather forecasts, electricity prices, and shifting load patterns introduce higher levels of uncertainty and can yield optimization problems that are difficult to solve in an efficient manner. Solution methods for single chance constraints in optimal power flow problems have been considered in the literature, ensuring single constraints are satisfied with a prescribed probability; however, joint chance constraints, ensuring multiple constraints are simultaneously satisfied, have predominantly been solved via scenario-based approaches or by utilizing Boole's inequality as an upper bound. In this paper, joint chance constraints are used to solve an AC optimal power flow problem while preventing overvoltages in distribution grids under high penetrations of photovoltaic systems. A tighter version of Boole's inequality is derived and used to provide a new upper bound on the joint chance constraint, and simulation results are shown demonstrating the benefit of the proposed upper bound. The new framework allows for a less conservative and more computationally efficient solution to considering joint chance constraints, specifically regarding preventing overvoltages.","Elsevier","","National Renewable Energy Lab.

To address this issue, we develop an optimization model and an algorithm for capacity planning and operations of microgrids that include N-1 security and other practical modeling features like AC power flow physics, component efficiencies and thermal limits.

It is implemented using fast ramping reserves that are expensive and wasteful, and which are expected to become increasingly necessary with the current acceleration of renewable penetration. The most promising solution to this problem is the use of demand response, i.e., load participation in frequency control. Yet it is still unclear how to efficiently integrate load participation without introducing instabilities and violating operational constraints. In this paper, we present a comprehensive load-side frequency control mechanism that can maintain the grid within operational constraints. In particular, our controllers can rebalance supply and demand after disturbances, restore the frequency to its nominal value, and preserve interarea power flows. Furthermore, our controllers are distributed (unlike the currently implemented frequency control), can allocate load updates optimally, and can maintain line flows within thermal limits. We prove that such a distributed load-side control is globally asymptotically stable and robust to unknown load parameters.

The proposed approach uses an active monitoring of power imbalances to rapidly redispatch CIGs. This approach differs from previously proposed frequency control schemes in that it employs feed-forward control based on a measured power imbalance rather that relying on a frequency measurement. As a result, time-domain simulations of the full Western Electricity Coordinating Council (WECC) system are conducted to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method, showing improved performance.","IEEE","","Sandia National Lab.

"Analysis of operating reserve demand curves in power system operations in the presence of variable generation","Krad, Ibrahim; Gao, David Wenzhong; Ela, Erik; Ibanez, Eduardo; Wu, Hongyu","24 POWER TRANSMISSION AND DISTRIBUTION; operating reserve; flexibility reserve; variable generation; variability; uncertainty; reliability; capacity","The electric power industry landscape is continually evolving. As emerging technologies such as wind and solar generating systems become more cost effective, traditional power system operating strategies will need to be re-evaluated. The presence of wind and solar generation (commonly referred to as variable generation or VG) can increase variability and uncertainty in the net-load profile. One mechanism to mitigate this issue is to schedule and dispatch additional operating reserves. These operating reserves aim to ensure that there is enough capacity online in the system to account for the increased variability and uncertainty occurring at finer temporal resolutions. A new operating reserve strategy, referred to as flexibility reserve, has been introduced in some regions. A similar implementation is explored in this study, and its implications on power system operations are analyzed. Results show that flexibility reserve products can improve economic metrics, particularly in significantly reducing the number of scarcity pricing events, with minimal impacts on reliability metrics and production costs. Furthermore, the production costs increased due to increased VG curtailment - i.e. including the flexible ramping product in the commitment of excess thermal capacity that needed to remain online at the expense of VG output.","Institution of Engineering and Technology (IET)","","National Renewable Energy Lab.

"A Bayesian Approach Based Outage Prediction in Electric Utility Systems Using Radar Measurement Data","Yue, Meng; Toto, Tami; Jensen, Michael P.; Giangrande, Scott E.; Lofaro, Robert","24 POWER TRANSMISSION AND DISTRIBUTION","Severe weather events such as strong thunderstorms are some of the most significant and frequent threats to the electrical grid infrastructure. Outages resulting from storms can be very costly. While some tools are available to utilities to predict storm occurrences and damage, they are typically very crude and provide little means of facilitating restoration efforts. This study developed a methodology to use historical high-resolution (both temporal and spatial) radar observations of storm characteristics and outage information to develop weather condition dependent failure rate models (FRMs) for different grid components. Such models can provide an estimation or prediction of the outage numbers in small areas of a utility’s service territory once the real-time measurement or forecasted data of weather conditions become available as the input to the models. Considering the potential value provided by real-time outages reported, a Bayesian outage prediction (BOP) algorithm is proposed to account for both strength and uncertainties of the reported outages and failure rate models. The potential benefit of this outage prediction scheme is illustrated in this study.","IEEE","","Brookhaven National Lab.

In the proposed scheme, the output of the additional control loop is determined as the product of the frequency deviation and adaptive gain, which is modified depending on the rate of change of frequency (ROCOF) and rotor speed. To achieve these objectives, the adaptive gain is set to be high during the early stage of a disturbance, when the ROCOF and rotor speed are high. Until the frequency nadir (FN), the gain decreases with the ROCOF and rotor speed. After the FN, the gain decreases only with the rotor speed. The simulation results demonstrate that the proposed scheme improves the FN and maximum ROCOF while ensuring the stable operation of a DFIG under various wind conditions irrespective of the disturbance conditions by adaptively changing the control gain with the ROCOF and rotor speed, even if the wind speed decreases and a consecutive disturbance occurs.","IEEE","","National Renewable Energy Lab.

As a specific example, consider just the bulk electric power system which is comprised of more than 200,000 miles of highvoltage transmission lines, thousands of generation plants and millions of digital controls. More than 1,800 entities own and operate portions of the grid system, with thousands more involved in the operation of distribution networks across North America. The interconnected and interdependent nature of the bulk power system requires a consistent and systematic application of risk mitigation across the entire grid system to be truly effective. Similar situations are found throughout automation where frequently an aging infrastructure is in place too. Consider, for example, the situation present in a refinery or chemical processing setting with the requirement for leak detection inspection of pipes, interconnects and systems stretching across the plant. The current practices and challenges relating just to this task - leak detection and repair (LDAR) – of detecting any fugitive emissions present and documenting all measurements thereby meeting air compliance regulations are typically “handled” by a small army of individuals with handheld or backpack-sized detectors who crawl through piping racks conducting measurements at each flange. Such work is performed in difficult conditions (temperature, humidity, physically challenging) with frequently a high level of employee turnover. Finaly, enter low cost sensors and mobile platforms – in other words unmanned aerial systems (UASs, or drones) with enhanced sensing capabilities.","Instrument Society of America","","Oak Ridge National Lab.

"Assessing the system value of optimal load shifting","Merrick, James; Ye, Yinyu; Entriken, Bob","97 MATHEMATICS AND COMPUTING; 24 POWER TRANSMISSION AND DISTRIBUTION","We analyze a competitive electricity market, where consumers exhibit optimal load shifting behavior to maximize utility and producers/suppliers maximize their profit under supply capacity constraints. The associated computationally tractable formulation can be used to inform market design or policy analysis in the context of increasing availability of the smart grid technologies that enable optimal load shifting. Through analytic and numeric assessment of the model, we assess the equilibrium value of optimal electricity load shifting, including how the value changes as more electricity consumers adopt associated technologies. For our illustrative numerical case, derived from the Current Trends scenario of the ERCOT Long Term System Assessment, the average energy arbitrage value per ERCOT customer of optimal load shifting technologies is estimated to be $3 for the 2031 scenario year. We assess the sensitivity of this result to the flexibility of load, along with its relationship to the deployment of renewables. Finally, the model presented can also be a starting point for designing system operation infrastructure that communicates with the devices that schedule loads in response to price signals.","IEEE","","Energy Modeling Forum at Stanford Univ., Stanford, CA (United States)","USDOE Office of Science (SC)","","United States","2017-04-30T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: IEEE Transactions on Smart Grid; Journal Volume: PP; Journal Issue: 99 (Early Access Article)","","Medium: ED; Size: 10 p.","","","SC0005171","Journal ID: ISSN 1949-3053","10.1109/TSG.2017.2699921","","2018-05-01T00:00:00Z","1373112","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/1373112","https://www.osti.gov/servlets/purl/1373112","IEEE Transactions on Smart Grid","99 (Early Access Article)","PP"

In the proposed scheme, the WPP controller dispatches different voltage set points to the DFIGs depending on their rotor voltage margins. The DFIGs inject different reactive power with the flexible I<sub>Q</sub>-V schemes implemented in the rotor-side and grid-side converters. The I<sub>Q</sub>-V characteristic, which consists of the gain and width of a linear band and I<sub>Q</sub> capability, varies with time depending on the I<sub>Q</sub> capability of the converters and a voltage dip at the point of interconnection (POI). To increase the I<sub>Q</sub> capability during a fault, the active current is reduced in proportion to a voltage dip. If the I<sub>Q</sub> capability and/or the POI voltage dip are large, the I<sub>Q</sub>-V gain is set to be high, thereby providing rapid voltage regulation. To avoid an overvoltage after the fault clearance, a rapid I<sub>Q</sub> reduction scheme is implemented in the WPP and DFIG controllers. The performance of the proposed flexible scheme was verified under scenarios with various disturbances. In conclusion, the proposed scheme can help increase wind power penetration without jeopardizing voltage stability.","IEEE","","National Renewable Energy Lab.

For the sake of system reliability and economics, it is essential for power system operators to better understand the ramping features of renewable, load, and netload. An optimized swinging door algorithm (OpSDA) is used and extended to accurately and efficiently detect ramping events. For wind power ramps detection, a process of merging 'bumps' (that have a different changing direction) into adjacent ramping segments is included to improve the performance of the OpSDA method. For solar ramps detection, ramping events that occur in both clear-sky and measured (or forecasted) solar power are removed to account for the diurnal pattern of solar generation. Ramping features are extracted and extensively compared between load and netload under different renewable penetration levels (9.77%, 15.85%, and 51.38%). Comparison results show that (i) netload ramp events with shorter durations and smaller magnitudes occur more frequently when renewable penetration level increases, and the total number of ramping events also increases; and (ii) different ramping characteristics are observed in load and netload even with a low renewable penetration level.","Elsevier","","National Renewable Energy Lab.

This paper examines the overvoltages that can be supported by inverters during single phase to ground faults via theory, simulation and experiment, identifies the relevant physical mechanisms, quantifies expected levels of overvoltage, and makes recommendations for optimal mitigation.","IEEE","","National Renewable Energy Lab.

"Evaluating the effects of real power losses in optimal power flow based storage integration","Castillo, Anya; Gayme, Dennice","24 POWER TRANSMISSION AND DISTRIBUTION","This study proposes a DC optimal power flow (DCOPF) with losses formulation (the `-DCOPF+S problem) and uses it to investigate the role of real power losses in OPF based grid-scale storage integration. We derive the `- DCOPF+S problem by augmenting a standard DCOPF with storage (DCOPF+S) problem to include quadratic real power loss approximations. This procedure leads to a multi-period nonconvex quadratically constrained quadratic program, which we prove can be solved to optimality using either a semidefinite or second order cone relaxation. Our approach has some important benefits over existing models. It is more computationally tractable than ACOPF with storage (ACOPF+S) formulations and the provably exact convex relaxations guarantee that an optimal solution can be attained for a feasible problem. Adding loss approximations to a DCOPF+S model leads to a more accurate representation of locational marginal prices, which have been shown to be critical to determining optimal storage dispatch and siting in prior ACOPF+S based studies. Case studies demonstrate the improved accuracy of the `-DCOPF+S model over a DCOPF+S model and the computational advantages over an ACOPF+S formulation.","IEEE","","Sandia National Lab.

The aggregation reduces a distribution network having thousands of nodes to an equivalent network with a few aggregated nodes, thereby enabling distribution system operators (DSOs) to make faster operational decisions. Moreover, the aggregation enables flexibility from small distributed flexible resources to be traded to different power and energy markets. A hierarchical control architecture comprising a combination of centralized and decentralized control approaches is proposed to practically deploy the aggregated flexibility. The proposed method serves as a great operational tool for DSOs to decide the exact amount of required flexibilities from different network section(s) for solving grid constraint violations. The effectiveness of the proposed method is demonstrated through simulation of three operational scenarios in a real low voltage distribution system having high penetrations of electric vehicles and heat pumps. Finally, the simulation results demonstrated that the aggregation helps DSOs not only in taking faster operational decisions, but also in effectively utilizing the available flexibility.","IEEE","","Idaho National Lab.

"An assessment of flexibility reserves in stochastic modeling at multiple timescales","Krad, Ibrahim; Gao, David Wenzhong; Wu, Hongyu","24 POWER TRANSMISSION AND DISTRIBUTION; operating reserves; reserve scheduling; security constrained economic dispatch; SCED; security constrained unit commitment; SCUC; stochastic optimization","Due to recent technological achievements, stochastic optimization, which inherently captures the uncertainty of intermittent resources, is being used to capture the variability and uncertainty of wind and solar resources. However, due to persistent computational limitations, it is not practical to consider all possible variable generation scenarios. As a result, a reduced number of most likely scenarios is usually considered. While this helps reduce the computational burden, it also leaves the system operator vulnerable to some risk. In order to address this issue, this paper aims at providing insight into using an explicit reserve requirement in a stochastic modeling framework in order to provide system operators with greater confidence in stochastic dispatch solutions. This is accomplished by simulating a modified version of the IEEE 118 bus system in a fully stochastic, multi-timescale framework with flexibility reserve requirements. Results show that utilizing a stochastic flexibility reserve requirement within the stochastic modeling framework offers the most reliability benefit.","Chinese Society for Electrical Engineering (CSEE)","","National Renewable Energy Lab.

Large ramps, one of the biggest concerns, can significantly influence system economics and reliability. The Wind Forecast Improvement Project (WFIP) was to improve the accuracy of forecasts and to evaluate the economic benefits of these improvements to grid operators. This paper evaluates the ramp forecasting accuracy gained by improving the performance of short-term wind power forecasting. This study focuses on the WFIP southern study region, which encompasses most of the Electric Reliability Council of Texas (ERCOT) territory, to compare the experimental WFIP forecasts to the existing short-term wind power forecasts (used at ERCOT) at multiple spatial and temporal scales. The study employs four significant wind power ramping definitions according to the power change magnitude, direction, and duration. The optimized swinging door algorithm is adopted to extract ramp events from actual and forecasted wind power time series. The results show that the experimental WFIP forecasts improve the accuracy of the wind power ramp forecasting. This improvement can result in substantial costs savings and power system reliability enhancements.","Elsevier","","National Renewable Energy Lab.

"Evaluating the Performance of the IEEE Standard 1366 Method for Identifying Major Event Days","Eto, Joseph H.; LaCommare, Kristina Hamachi; Sohn, Michael D.; Caswell, Heidemarie C.","24 POWER TRANSMISSION AND DISTRIBUTION","IEEE Standard 1366 offers a method for segmenting reliability performance data to isolate the effects of major events from the underlying year-to-year trends in reliability. Recent analysis by the IEEE Distribution Reliability Working Group (DRWG) has found that reliability performance of some utilities differs from the expectations that helped guide the development of the Standard 1366 method. This paper proposes quantitative metrics to evaluate the performance of the Standard 1366 method in identifying major events and in reducing year-to-year variability in utility reliability. The metrics are applied to a large sample of utility-reported reliability data to assess performance of the method with alternative specifications that have been considered by the DRWG. We find that none of the alternatives perform uniformly 'better' than the current Standard 1366 method. That is, none of the modifications uniformly lowers the year-to-year variability in System Average Interruption Duration Index without major events. Instead, for any given alternative, while it may lower the value of this metric for some utilities, it also increases it for other utilities (sometimes dramatically). Thus, we illustrate some of the trade-offs that must be considered in using the Standard 1366 method and highlight the usefulness of the metrics we have proposed in conducting these evaluations.","IEEE","","Lawrence Berkeley National Lab.

The main result is a time-domain expression which provides an exact representation of the summed and interleaved triangular waveforms, where the peak amplitude and parameters of the time-periodic component are all specified in closed-form. Analysis is general and can be used to study various applications in multi-converter systems. This model is unique not only in that it reveals a simple and intuitive expression for the net ripple, but its derivation via modular arithmetic and Fourier series is distinct from prior approaches.

The design of the distributed control algorithm is based on suitable linear approximation of the ac power-flow equations, and leverages the so-called alternating direction method of multipliers (ADMM). Convergence of the RES-inverter output powers to solutions of the approximate ac OPF problem is established under suitable conditions on the mismatches between the commanded setpoints and actual RES output powers. Overall, since the proposed scheme can be cast as an ADMM with inexact primal and dual updates, the convergence results can be applied to more general distributed optimization settings.","IEEE","","National Renewable Energy Lab.

Emerging concepts of smart communities/cities are examining the potential to leverage cleaner sources of generation, as well as integrating electricity generation with other municipal functions. When grid connected, these generation assets can supplement the existing interconnections with the bulk transmission system, and in the event of an extreme event, they can provide power via a collection of microgrids. To achieve the highest level of resiliency, it may be necessary to conduct switching operations to interconnect individual microgrids. While the interconnection of multiple microgrids can increase the resiliency of the system, the associated switching operations can cause large transients in low inertia microgrids.

Specifically, the transmission-distribution-network coordination issue of the hierarchical modeling method is investigated. First, a curve-fitting approach is developed to provide a cost function of the slave model for the master model, which reflects the impacts of each slave model. Second, the transmission and distribution networks are decoupled at feeder buses, and all the distribution networks are coordinated by the master reactive power optimization model to achieve the global optimality.

To help better manage and dispatch the wind power, this paper develops a data-driven probabilistic WPR forecasting (p-WPRF) method based on a large number of simulated scenarios. A machine learning technique is first adopted to forecast the basic wind power forecasting scenario and produce the historical forecasting errors. To accurately model the distribution of wind power forecasting errors, a generalized Gaussian mixture model is developed and the cumulative distribution function (CDF) is also analytically deduced. The inverse transform method based on the CDF is used to generate a large number of forecasting error scenarios. An optimized swinging door algorithm is adopted to extract all the WPRs from the complete set of wind power forecasting scenarios. The p-WPRF is generated based on all generated scenarios under different weather and time conditions. Numerical simulations on publicly available wind power data show that the developed p-WPRF method can predict WPRs with a high level of reliability and accuracy.","IEEE","","National Renewable Energy Lab.

Flexibility of operation, the ability of a power system to respond to change in demand and supply, is critical to enable higher levels of variable generation. One way to unlock this potential flexibility is to tap into other energy domains. This concept of interconnecting energy domains is called ESI. ESI is the process of coordinating the operation and planning of energy systems across multiple pathways and/or geographical scales to deliver reliable, cost-effective energy services with minimal impact on the environment. Integrating energy domains adds flexibility to the electrical power system. ESI includes interactions among energy vectors and with other large-scale infrastructures including water, transport, and data and communications networks, which are an enabling technology for ESI.","IEEE","","National Renewable Energy Lab.

From this perspective, we define 'social energy' as a complex sociotechnical system of energy systems, social systems and the derived artificial virtual systems which characterize the intense intersystem and intra-system interactions. The recent advancement in intelligent technology, including artificial intelligence and machine learning technologies, sensing and communication in Internet of Things technologies, and massive high performance computing and extreme-scale data analytics technologies, enables the possibility of substantial advancement in socio-technical system optimization, scheduling, control and management. In this paper, we provide a discussion on the nature of energy, and then propose the concept and intention of social energy systems for electrical power. A general methodology of establishing and investigating social energy is proposed, which is based on the ACP approach, i.e., 'artificial systems' (A), 'computational experiments' (C) and 'parallel execution' (P), and parallel system methodology. A case study on the University of Denver (DU) campus grid is provided and studied to demonstrate the social energy concept. In the concluding remarks, we discuss the technical pathway, in both social and nature sciences, to social energy, and our vision on its future.","","","National Renewable Energy Lab.

"Optimal Placement of Dynamic Var Sources by Using Empirical Controllability Covariance","Qi, Junjian; Huang, Weihong; Sun, Kai (ORCID:0000000203052725); Kang, Wei","24 POWER TRANSMISSION AND DISTRIBUTION","In this paper, the empirical controllability covariance (ECC), which is calculated around the considered operating condition of a power system, is applied to quantify the degree of controllability of system voltages under specific dynamic var source locations. An optimal dynamic var source placement method addressing fault-induced delayed voltage recovery (FIDVR) issues is further formulated as an optimization problem that maximizes the determinant of ECC. The optimization problem is effectively solved by the NOMAD solver, which implements the mesh adaptive direct search algorithm. The proposed method is tested on an NPCC 140-bus system and the results show that the proposed method with fault specified ECC can solve the FIDVR issue caused by the most severe contingency with fewer dynamic var sources than the voltage sensitivity index (VSI)-based method. The proposed method with fault unspecified ECC does not depend on the settings of the contingency and can address more FIDVR issues than the VSI method when placing the same number of SVCs under different fault durations. It is also shown that the proposed method can help mitigate voltage collapse.","IEEE","","Argonne National Lab.

"Nonlinear Model Reduction in Power Systems by Balancing of Empirical Controllability and Observability Covariances","Qi, Junjian; Wang, Jianhui; Liu, Hui; Dimitrovski, Aleksandar D.","24 POWER TRANSMISSION AND DISTRIBUTION","Abstract: In this paper, nonlinear model reduction for power systems is performed by the balancing of empirical controllability and observability covariances that are calculated around the operating region. Unlike existing model reduction methods, the external system does not need to be linearized but is directly dealt with as a nonlinear system. A transformation is found to balance the controllability and observability covariances in order to determine which states have the greatest contribution to the input-output behavior. The original system model is then reduced by Galerkin projection based on this transformation. The proposed method is tested and validated on a system comprised of a 16-machine 68-bus system and an IEEE 50-machine 145-bus system. The results show that by using the proposed model reduction the calculation efficiency can be greatly improved; at the same time, the obtained state trajectories are close to those for directly simulating the whole system or partitioning the system while not performing reduction. Compared with the balanced truncation method based on a linearized model, the proposed nonlinear model reduction method can guarantee higher accuracy and similar calculation efficiency. It is shown that the proposed method is not sensitive to the choice of the matrices for calculating the empirical covariances.","IEEE","","Argonne National Lab.

"Rapid Active Power Control of Photovoltaic Systems for Grid Frequency Support","Hoke, Anderson (ORCID:0000000267917812); Shirazi, Mariko; Chakraborty, Sudipta; Muljadi, Eduard; Maksimovic, Dragan","14 SOLAR ENERGY; 24 POWER TRANSMISSION AND DISTRIBUTION; active power control; frequency control; photovoltaics; power systems","As deployment of power electronic coupled generation such as photovoltaic (PV) systems increases, grid operators have shown increasing interest in calling on inverter-coupled generation to help mitigate frequency contingency events by rapidly surging active power into the grid. When responding to contingency events, the faster the active power is provided, the more effective it may be for arresting the frequency event. This paper proposes a predictive PV inverter control method for very fast and accurate control of active power. This rapid active power control method will increase the effectiveness of various higher-level controls designed to mitigate grid frequency contingency events, including fast power-frequency droop, inertia emulation, and fast frequency response, without the need for energy storage. The rapid active power control method, coupled with a maximum power point estimation method, is implemented in a prototype PV inverter connected to a PV array. The prototype inverter's response to various frequency events is experimentally confirmed to be fast (beginning within 2 line cycles and completing within 4.5 line cycles of a severe test event) and accurate (below 2% steady-state error).","IEEE","","National Renewable Energy Lab.

The integrated eVoucher program entails demand side management, either in the positive or negative direction, following a popular customer-centric design principle. It provides the extra economic benefit to end-users and reduces the risk associated with the wholesale electricity market for electric distribution companies (EDCs), meanwhile improving the potential resilience of the distribution networks with consideration for frequency deviations. When implemented, the eVoucher program allows typical flexible loads, such as electric vehicle parking lots, to adjust their demand and consumption behavior according to financial incentives from an EDC. A distribution system operator (DSO) works as a third party to hasten negotiations between such parking lots and EDCs, as well as the price clearing process. Eventually, both electricity retailers and power system operators will benefit from the active participation of the flexible loads and energy customers.","Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers","","University of Michigan-Dearborn, MI (United States)","USDOE Office of Energy Efficiency and Renewable Energy (EERE)","","United States","2017-01-01T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: IEEE Access Journal Volume: 5","","Medium: X; Size: p. 2101-2110","","","EE0005565","Journal ID: ISSN 2169-3536; 7835154","10.1109/ACCESS.2017.2659704","","2021-10-12T00:00:00Z","1346439","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/1346439","","IEEE Access","","5"
