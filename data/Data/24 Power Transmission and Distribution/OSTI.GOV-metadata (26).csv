"Recent Trends in Variable Generation Forecasting and Its Value to the Power System","Orwig, Kirsten D.; Ahlstrom, Mark L.; Banunarayanan, Venkat; Sharp, Justin; Wilczak, James M.; Freedman, Jeffrey; Haupt, Sue Ellen; Cline, Joel; Bartholomy, Obadiah; Hamann, Hendrik F.; Hodge, Bri-Mathias; Finley, Catherine; Nakafuji, Dora; Peterson, Jack L.; Maggio, David; Marquis, Melinda","24 POWER TRANSMISSION AND DISTRIBUTION; forecasting; large-scale integration; market design; power system reliability; renewable energy (RE); solar energy; variable generation; wind energy; National Renewable Energy Laboratory (NREL); NREL","We report that the rapid deployment of wind and solar energy generation systems has resulted in a need to better understand, predict, and manage variable generation. The uncertainty around wind and solar power forecasts is still viewed by the power industry as being quite high, and many barriers to forecast adoption by power system operators still remain. In response, the U.S. Department of Energy has sponsored, in partnership with the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, public, private, and academic organizations, two projects to advance wind and solar power forecasts. Additionally, several utilities and grid operators have recognized the value of adopting variable generation forecasting and have taken great strides to enhance their usage of forecasting. In parallel, power system markets and operations are evolving to integrate greater amounts of variable generation. This paper will discuss the recent trends in wind and solar power forecasting technologies in the U.S., the role of forecasting in an evolving power system framework, and the benefits to intended forecast users.","IEEE","","National Renewable Energy Lab.

"Primary-Side Power Flow Control of Wireless Power Transfer for Electric Vehicle Charging","Miller, John M.; Onar, Omer C.; Chinthavali, Madhu","24 POWER TRANSMISSION AND DISTRIBUTION; 42 ENGINEERING; EV charging; inductive power transfer; wireless power transfer","Various noncontacting methods of plug-in electric vehicle charging are either under development or now deployed as aftermarket options in the light-duty automotive market. Wireless power transfer (WPT) is now the accepted term for wireless charging and is used synonymously for inductive power transfer and magnetic resonance coupling. WPT technology is in its infancy; standardization is lacking, especially on interoperability, center frequency selection, magnetic fringe field suppression, and the methods employed for power flow regulation. This paper proposes a new analysis concept for power flow in WPT in which the primary provides frequency selection and the tuned secondary, with its resemblance to a power transmission network having a reactive power voltage control, is analyzed as a transmission network. Analysis is supported with experimental data taken from Oak Ridge National Laboratory s WPT apparatus. Lastly, this paper also provides an experimental evidence for frequency selection, fringe field assessment, and the need for low-latency communications in the feedback path.","IEEE","","Oak Ridge National Lab.

"Electrical Current Leakage and Open-Core Threading Dislocations in AlGaN-Based Deep Ultraviolet Light-Emitting Diodes.","Moseley, Michael William; Allerman, Andrew A.; Crawford, Mary H.; Wierer, Jonathan; Smith, Michael L.; Biedermann, Laura","24 POWER TRANSMISSION AND DISTRIBUTION","Electrical current transport through leakage paths in AlGaN-based deep ultraviolet (DUV) lightemitting diodes (LEDs) and their effect on LED performance are investigated. Open-core threading dislocations, or nanopipes, are found to conduct current through nominally insulating Al0.7Ga0.3N layers and limit the performance of DUV-LEDs. A defect-sensitive phosphoric acid etch reveals these opencore threading dislocations in the form of large, micron-scale hexagonal etch pits visible with optical microscopy, while closed-core screw-, edge-, and mixed-type threading dislocations are represented by smaller and more numerous nanometer-scale pits visible by atomic-force microscopy. The electrical and optical performances of DUV-LEDs fabricated on similar Si-doped Al0.7Ga0.3N templates are found to have a strong correlation to the density of these nanopipes, despite their small fraction (<0.1% in this study) of the total density of threading dislocations.","American Institute of Physics (AIP)","","Sandia National Lab.

"Geographic Footprint of Electricity Use for Water Services in the Western U.S.","Tidwell, Vincent C.; Moreland, Barbara Denise; Zemlick, Katie","24 POWER TRANSMISSION AND DISTRIBUTION; 29 ENERGY PLANNING, POLICY, AND ECONOMY","A significant fraction of our nation’s electricity use goes to lift, convey, and treat water, while the resulting expenditures on electricity represent a key budgetary consideration for water service providers. In order to improve understanding of the electricity-for-water interdependency, electricity used in providing water services is mapped at the regional, state and county level for the 17-conterminous states in the Western U.S. Our study is unique in estimating electricity use for large-scale conveyance and agricultural pumping as well as mapping these electricity uses along with that for drinking and wastewater services at a state and county level. These results indicate that drinking and wastewater account for roughly 2% of total West-wide electricity use, while an additional 1.2% is consumed by large-scale conveyance projects and 2.6% is consumed by agricultural pumping. The percent of electricity used for water services varies strongly by state with some as high as 34%, while other states expend less than 1%. Every county in the West uses some electricity for water services; however, there is a large disparity in use ranging from 10 MWh/yr to 5.8 TWh/yr. Finally, our results support long-term transmission planning in the Western U.S. by characterizing an important component of the electric load.","American Chemical Society (ACS)","","Sandia National Lab.

Considering positive-, negative-, and zero-sequence components in both arm voltages and currents, the generalized instantaneous power of a phase unit is derived theoretically according to the equivalent circuit model of the MMC under unbalanced conditions. Based on this model, a novel double-line frequency dc-voltage ripple suppression control is proposed. This controller, together with the negative-and zero-sequence current control, could enhance the overall fault-tolerant capability of the HVDC system without additional cost. To further improve the fault-tolerant capability, the operation performance of the HVDC system with and without single-phase switching is discussed and compared in detail. Lastly, simulation results from a three-phase MMC-HVDC system generated with MATLAB/Simulink are provided to support the theoretical analysis and proposed control schemes.","IEEE","","Oak Ridge National Lab.

"Effects of Phasor Measurement Uncertainty on Power Line Outage Detection","Chen, Chen; Wang, Jianhui; Zhu, Hao","24 POWER TRANSMISSION AND DISTRIBUTION","Phasor measurement unit (PMU) technology provides an effective tool to enhance the wide-area monitoring systems (WAMSs) in power grids. Although extensive studies have been conducted to develop several PMU applications in power systems (e.g., state estimation, oscillation detection and control, voltage stability analysis, and line outage detection), the uncertainty aspects of PMUs have not been adequately investigated. This paper focuses on quantifying the impact of PMU uncertainty on power line outage detection and identification, in which a limited number of PMUs installed at a subset of buses are utilized to detect and identify the line outage events. Specifically, the line outage detection problem is formulated as a multi-hypothesis test, and a general Bayesian criterion is used for the detection procedure, in which the PMU uncertainty is analytically characterized. We further apply the minimum detection error criterion for the multi-hypothesis test and derive the expected detection error probability in terms of PMU uncertainty. The framework proposed provides fundamental guidance for quantifying the effects of PMU uncertainty on power line outage detection. Case studies are provided to validate our analysis and show how PMU uncertainty influences power line outage detection.","IEEE","","Argonne National Lab.

"Efficient algorithm for locating and sizing series compensation devices in large power transmission grids: I. Model implementation","Frolov, Vladimir; Backhaus, Scott; Chertkov, Misha","24 POWER TRANSMISSION AND DISTRIBUTION; power flows; series compensation devices; non-convex optimization","We explore optimization methods for planning the placement, sizing and operations of Flexible Alternating Current Transmission System (FACTS) devices installed to relieve transmission grid congestion. We limit our selection of FACTS devices to Series Compensation (SC) devices that can be represented by modification of the inductance of transmission lines. Our master optimization problem minimizes the l<sub>1</sub> norm of the inductance modification subject to the usual line thermal-limit constraints. We develop heuristics that reduce this non-convex optimization to a succession of Linear Programs (LP) which are accelerated further using cutting plane methods. The algorithm solves an instance of the MatPower Polish Grid model (3299 lines and 2746 nodes) in 40 seconds per iteration on a standard laptop—a speed up that allows the sizing and placement of a family of SC devices to correct a large set of anticipated congestions. We observe that our algorithm finds feasible solutions that are always sparse, i.e., SC devices are placed on only a few lines. In a companion manuscript, we demonstrate our approach on realistically-sized networks that suffer congestion from a range of causes including generator retirement. In this manuscript, we focus on the development of our approach, investigate its structure on a small test system subject to congestion from uniform load growth, and demonstrate computational efficiency on a realistically-sized network.","IOP Publishing","","Los Alamos National Lab.

Solutions and applications","Frolov, Vladimir; Backhaus, Scott; Chertkov, Misha","24 POWER TRANSMISSION AND DISTRIBUTION","In a companion manuscript, we developed a novel optimization method for placement, sizing, and operation of Flexible Alternating Current Transmission System (FACTS) devices to relieve transmission network congestion. Specifically, we addressed FACTS that provide Series Compensation (SC) via modification of line inductance.

The results on the 30-bus network are used to study the general properties of the solutions including non-locality and sparsity. The Polish grid is used as a demonstration of the computational efficiency of the heuristics that leverages sequential linearization of power flow constraints and cutting plane methods that take advantage of the sparse nature of the SC placement solutions. Using these approaches, the algorithm is able to solve an instance of Polish grid in tens of seconds. We explore the utility of the algorithm by analyzing transmission networks congested by (a) uniform load growth, (b) multiple overloaded configurations, and (c) sequential generator retirements.","IOP Publishing","","Los Alamos National Lab.

Power plants typically produce more power than necessary to ensure adequate power quality. By taking advantage of energy storage within the grid, many of these inefficiencies can be removed. Advanced modeling is required when using battery energy storage systems (BESS) for grid storage in order to accurately monitor and control the storage system. Battery management systems (BMS) control how the storage system will be used and a BMS that utilizes advanced physics-based models will offer for much more robust operation of the storage system. The paper outlines the current state of the art for modeling in BMS and the advanced models required to fully utilize BMS for both lithium-ion batteries and vanadium redox-flow batteries. In addition, system architecture and how it can be useful in monitoring and control is discussed.

As these new resources are interconnected with the EPS, it is essential that they not only comply with the relevant interconnection standards, but that they also are evaluated under various dynamic resource input and grid conditions to ensure that they will properly participate in the advancedEPS architecture. To this end, NREL leveraged controller hardware-in-the-loop (CHIL) and power hardware-in-the-lopp (PHIL) simulation techniques to create an advanced platform for the development and evaluation of photovoltaic (PV) inverters. This paper describes a CHIL-based methodology by which PV inverter controllers can be tested against simulated inverter hardware before prior to at powertesting, a PHIL-based PV simulator that can be used to test a PV inverter's response to the truly dynamic output of a PV array, and a grid interconnection evaluator that leverages PHIL techniques to automate the execution and analysis of key interconnection standard test procedures. A number of demonstration test results are presented. These capabilities make up a novel platform that will helpdevelop the PV inverters that will support the next generation EPS.","","","National Renewable Energy Lab.

We integrate the consumer response model into the Electricity Market Complex Adaptive System (EMCAS). EMCAS is an agent-based model that simulates restructured electricity markets. We explore the impacts of dynamic-pricing on price spikes, peak demand, consumer energy bills, power supplier profits, and congestion costs.

Applications for SOFCs encompass a large range of power levels including 1-2 kW residential combined heat and power applications, 100-250 kW sized systems for distributed generation and grid extension, and MW-scale power plants utilizing coal. This paper reports on the development of a highly efficient, small-scale SOFC power system operating on methane. The system uses adiabatic steam reforming of methane and anode gas recirculation to achieve high net electrical efficiency. The anode exit gas is recirculated and all of the heat and water required for the endothermic reforming reaction are provided by the anode gas emerging from the SOFC stack. Although the single-pass fuel utilization is only about 55%, because of the anode gas recirculation the overall fuel utilization is up to 93%. The demonstrated system achieved gross power output of 1650 to 2150 watts with a maximum net LHV efficiency of 56.7% at 1720 watts. Overall system efficiency could be further improved to over 60% with use of properly sized blowers.","","","Pacific Northwest National Lab.

However, a grid employing large amounts of wind and solar energy requires the balance of the system to be highly flexible to respond to the increased variability of the net load. This makes deployment of conventional nuclear power challenging both due to the technical challenges of plant cycling and economic limits of reduced capacity factor. In the United States nuclear power plants generally provide constant, base load power and are most economic when operated at constant power levels. Operating nuclear power plants in load-following modes decreases the plants' annual energy output and increases the levelized cost of energy, decreasing economic competitiveness. One possible solution is to couple thermal energy storage to nuclear power plants. This would enable the reactor to remain at nearly constant output, while cycling the electrical generator in response to the variability of the net load. This paper conceptually explores combinations of wind, solar, and nuclear that can provide a large fraction of a system's electricity, assuming the use of thermal energy storage that would allow nuclear power to provide load following and cycling duty while operating at a constant reactor power output.","","","National Renewable Energy Lab.

We present a detailed emissions analysis based on comprehensive modeling of power system operations with unit commitment and economic dispatch for different wind penetration levels. First, by minimizing cost, the unit commitment model decides which thermal power plants will be utilized based on a wind power forecast, and then, the economic dispatch model dictates the level of production for each unit as a function of the realized wind power generation. Finally, knowing the power production from each power plant, the emissions are calculated. The emissions model incorporates the effects of both cycling and start-ups of thermal power plants in analyzing emissions from an electric power system with increasing levels of wind power. Our results for the power system in the state of Illinois show significant emissions effects from increased cycling and particularly start-ups of thermal power plants. However, we conclude that as the wind power penetration increases, pollutant emissions decrease overall due to the replacement of fossil fuels.","","","Argonne National Lab.

The first avenue is a sudden and significant power unbalance exceeding reasonable operating reserve capacity. The second is a sudden increase of power flows on the system critical paths causing transmission violations. The challenge in managing these system unbalances is more significant for a standalone balancing area operation. The consolidation of balancing authorities into a single balancing area can offset the operating reserve problem but this strategy enhances incremental power flows on the transmission interfaces, potentially leading to more unpredictable transmission congestion. This paper evaluates the expectancy of occurrence of tail events due to forecast error extremes using California ISO and BPA data. Having this type of information, independent system operators and operating utilities could be better prepared to address the tail events by exploring alternative reserve options such as: wide area control coordination, new operating proce-dures and remedial actions.","","","Pacific Northwest National Lab.

Population modeling and other analyses to support Pacific salmon recovery efforts have assumed that the survival of juvenile salmonids during the transportation experience was 98%. To estimate survival during barge transport from Lower Granite Dam on the Snake River to a release area downstream of Bonneville Dam, a distance of 470 km, we used a novel adaptation of a release-recapture model with acoustic-tagged yearling Chinook salmon (Oncorhynchus tshawytscha) smolts. A total of 1,494 yearling Chinook salmon were surgically implanted with Juvenile Salmon Acoustic Telemetry System (JSATS) acoustic transmitters and passive integrated transponders (PIT) and divided into three groups. The three tagged groups consisted of; (1) a group which was released into the raceway with the population of fish which were later loaded into transportation barges (R{sub B}), (2) a group which was held in a net-pen suspended within the general barge population until 5-6 h prior to barge evacuation, at which time they were confirmed to be alive and then released into the general barge population (R{sub A}), and (3) to validate a model assumption, a group which was euthanized and released into the barge population 2-8 h prior to barge evacuation (R{sub D}). Six replicates of these groups were loaded onto fish transport barges that departed Lower Granite Dam on the Snake River between 29 April and 13 May, 2010. Acoustic receiver arrays between 70 and 220 km downstream of the barge evacuation site were used to detect tagged fish and served as the basis for estimation of survival within the barge. Tag-life-corrected estimates of reach survival were calculated for barged and control fish in each of the six replicate trials. The ratio of survival from release to Rkm 153 for barged fish relative to control fish provided the estimate of within-barge survival. The replicate survival estimates ranged from 0.9503 (SE = 0.0253) to 1.0003 (SE = 0.0155). The weighted average of the replicate estimates of within-barge survival was computed to be = 0.9833 (SE = 0.0062).

Electrochemical behaviors of the cathode based on graphitic mesoporous carbon supported Pt catalyst were examined using electrochemical impedance spectroscopy and cyclic voltammetry. Impedance data were plotted and expressed in the complex capacitance form to determine useful parameters in the transmission line model: the double-layer capacitance, peak frequency, and ionic resistance. Electrochemical surface area and hydrogen crossover current through the membrane were estimated from cyclic voltammogram, while cathode Faradaic resistance was compared with ionic resistance as a function of test time. It was observed that during an accelerated stress test of catalyst support, graphitic mesoporous carbon becomes hydrophilic which increases interfacial area between the ionomer and the catalyst up to 100 h. However, the ionic resistance in the catalyst layer drastically increases after 100 h with further carbon support oxidation. The underlying mechanism has been studied and it was found that significant degradation of ionic pathway throughout the catalyst layer due to catalyst support corrosion induces uneven hydration and mechanical stress in the ionomer.","","","Pacific Northwest National Lab.

Voltage optimization, demand response, electric vehicle charging, and energy storage are examples of technologies with characteristics having daily, seasonal, and/or annual variations. In addition to the seasonal variations, emerging technologies such as demand response and plug in electric vehicle charging have the potential to send control signals to the end use loads which will affect how they consume energy. In order to support time-series analysis over different time frames and to incorporate potential control signal inputs it is necessary to develop detailed end use load models which accurately represent the load under various conditions, and not just during the peak load period. This paper will build on previous work on detail end use load modeling in order to outline the method of general multi-state load models for distribution system analysis.","","","Pacific Northwest National Lab.

Most of us repeat this sequence many times each day, and never give it another thought. But that seemingly simple light switch on the wall connects us to one of the most complex systems in the world: the electrical grid. Most of the United States is served by a highly reliable and adequate supply of electrical power, which is distributed through a grid of thousands of miles of electricity-transmission lines. However, as the electricity-supply infrastructure ages and consumer demand for electricity grows, the capacity to deliver electrical power hasn't kept pace with demand, and upgrading the electrical-transmission grid has become a more pressing need. From 1988-1998, demand for transmission grew by 30 percent while transmission grew by only 15 percent. From 1999-2009, demand grew by 20 percent and transmission by only 3 percent Despite a short-term decline related to the economic downturn and improved efficiency, U.S. energy consumption is expected to increase by 14 percent between 2008 and 2035. This growth will drive the need to develop viable routes for new transmission lines. Because transmission lines extend over large distances, they typically cross many federal, tribal, state, local and private land jurisdictions, each with a complex and varying set of siting issues and land-management practices. And as the existing grid needs improvement to meet growing demand, the U.S. is rapidly developing renewable energy sources, particularly solar and wind energy, often in areas far removed from existing electricity-transmission infrastructure and energy-consumption areas.","","","Argonne National Lab.

The approach includes three steps: forecast data acquisition, statistical analysis of retrospective information, and prediction of grid balancing requirements for a specified time horizon and a given confidence level. An assessment of the capacity and ramping requirements is performed using a specially developed probabilistic algorithm based on histogram analysis, incorporating sources of uncertainty - both continuous (wind and load forecast errors) and discrete (forced generator outages and start-up failures). A new method called the 'flying-brick' technique is developed to evaluate the look-ahead required generation performance envelope for the worst case scenario within a user-specified confidence level. A self-validation process is used to validate the accuracy of the confidence intervals. To demonstrate the validity of the developed uncertainty assessment methods and its impact on grid operation, a framework for integrating the proposed methods with an EMS system is developed. Demonstration through EMS integration illustrates the applicability of the proposed methodology and the developed tool for actual grid operation and paves the road for integration with EMS systems in control rooms.","","","Pacific Northwest National Lab.

Here in Part 2, we describe how the JSATS cabled system was employed as a reference sensor network for detecting and tracking juvenile salmon. Time-of-arrival data for valid detections on four hydrophones were used to solve for the three-dimensional (3D) position of fish surgically implanted with JSATS acoustic transmitters. Validation tests demonstrated high accuracy of 3D tracking up to 100 m from the John Day Dam spillway. The along-dam component, used for assigning the route of fish passage, had the highest accuracy; the median errors ranged from 0.06 to 0.22 m, and root mean square errors ranged from 0.05 to 0.56 m at distances up to 100 m. For the case study at John Day Dam during 2008, the range for 3D tracking was more than 100 m upstream of the dam face where hydrophones were deployed, and detection and tracking probabilities of fish tagged with JSATS acoustic transmitters were higher than 98%. JSATS cabled systems have been successfully deployed on several major dams to acquire information for salmon protection and for development of more “fish-friendly” hydroelectric facilities.","","","Pacific Northwest National Lab.

The increase in the penetration of wind generation in recent years has led to a number of challenges for the planning and operation of power systems. A key metric for system adequacy is the capacity value of generation. The capacity value of a generator is the contribution that a given generator makes to overall system adequacy. The variable and stochastic nature of wind sets it apart from conventional energy sources. As a result, the modeling of wind generation in the same manner as conventional generation for capacity value calculations is inappropriate. In this paper a preferred method for calculation of the capacity value of wind is described and a discussion of the pertinent issues surrounding it is given. Approximate methods for the calculation are also described with their limitations highlighted. The outcome of recent wind capacity value analyses in Europe and North America are highlighted with a description of open research questions also given.","","","Pacific Northwest National Lab.

This CM circulating current can be separated into two separate components based on their frequency; the high-frequency component, close to the switching frequency, can be effectively limited by means of passive components; the low-frequency component, close to the fundamental frequency, embodies the jumping CM circulating current observed in parallel VSCs. This is the main reason why it is usually recommended not to implement discontinuous and interleaving PWM together. The origin of this low-frequency circulating current is analyzed in detail, and based on this, a method to eliminate its presence is proposed by impeding the simultaneous use of different zero vectors between the converters. This control method only requires six additional switching actions per line cycle, presenting a minimum impact on the converter thermal design. The analysis and the feasibility of the control method are verified by simulation and experimental results.","","","Oak Ridge National Lab.

In this paper, we will report techniques and results for ac loss measurements carried out on several HTS cables with and without an HTS shielding layer. For cables without a shielding layer, care must be taken to control the effect of the magnetic fields from return currents on loss measurements. The waveform of the axial magnetic field was also measured by a small pick-up coil placed inside a two-layer cable.

The V{sub 2}O{sub 5} film based electrodes showed stable reversible discharge capacity in the range of 200-250 mAh g{sup -1} when cycled in the voltage window 2-4 V. We further discuss the mechanism for controlling the particle growth and morphology, and also the optimization of reversible lithium storage capacity. The nanorods of V{sub 2}O{sub 5} formed after the anneal treatment also show reversible storage capacity indicative of the potential use of such film based electrodes for energy storage.","","","Oak Ridge National Lab.

"Complex Capacitance Scaling in Ionic Liquids-Filled Nanopores","Sumpter, Bobby G","24 POWER TRANSMISSION AND DISTRIBUTION; CAPACITANCE; ENERGY DENSITY; ENERGY STORAGE; MOLTEN SALTS; OPENINGS; POWER TRANSMISSION LINES; SOLVATION","Recent experiments have shown that the capacitance of subnanometer pores increases anomalously as the pore width decreases, thereby opening a new avenue for developing supercapacitors with enhanced energy density. However, this behavior is still subject to some controversy since its physical origins are not well understood. Using atomistic simulations, we show that the capacitance of slit-shaped nanopores in contact with room-temperature ionic liquids exhibits a U-shaped scaling behavior in pores with widths from 0.75 to 1.26 nm. The left branch of the capacitance scaling curve directly corresponds to the anomalous capacitance increase and thus reproduces the experimental observations. The right branch of the curve indirectly agrees with experimental findings that so far have received little attention. The overall U-shaped scaling behavior provides insights on the origins of the difficulty in experimentally observing the pore-width-dependent capacitance. We establish a theoretical framework for understanding the capacitance of electrical double layers in nanopores and provide mechanistic details into the origins of the observed scaling behavior. The framework highlights the critical role of 'ion solvation' in controlling pore capacitance and the importance of choosing anion/cation couples carefully for optimal energy storage in a given pore system.","","","Oak Ridge National Lab.

"Exploring Complex Systems Aspects of Blackout Risk and Mitigation","Newman, David E; Carreras, Benjamin A; Lynch, Vickie E; Dobson, Ian","24 POWER TRANSMISSION AND DISTRIBUTION; 45 MILITARY TECHNOLOGY, WEAPONRY, AND NATIONAL DEFENSE; CRITICALITY; ELECTRIC POWER; MITIGATION; NATIONAL SECURITY; OUTAGES; POWER TRANSMISSION; SIMULATION","Electric power transmission systems are a key infrastructure, and blackouts of these systems have major consequences for the economy and national security. Analyses of blackout data suggest that blackout size distributions have a power law form over much of their range. This result is an indication that blackouts behave as a complex dynamical system. We use a simulation of an upgrading power transmission system to investigate how these complex system dynamics impact the assessment and mitigation of blackout risk. The mitigation of failures in complex systems needs to be approached with care. The mitigation efforts can move the system to a new dynamic equilibrium while remaining near criticality and preserving the power law region. Thus, while the absolute frequency of blackouts of all sizes may be reduced, the underlying forces can still cause the relative frequency of large blackouts to small blackouts to remain the same. Moreover, in some cases, efforts to mitigate small blackouts can even increase the frequency of large blackouts. This result occurs because the large and small blackouts are not mutually independent, but are strongly coupled by the complex dynamics.","","","Oak Ridge National Lab.

In this paper a multiobjective optimization algorithm based on PSO applied to the optimal design of photovoltaic grid-connected systems (PVGCSs) is presented. The proposed methodology intends to suggest the optimal number of system devices and the optimal PV module installation details, such that the economic and environmental benefits achieved during the system's operational lifetime period are both maximized. The objective function describing the economic benefit of the proposed optimization process is the lifetime system's total net profit which is calculated according to the method of the Net Present Value (NPV). The second objective function, which corresponds to the environmental benefit, equals to the pollutant gas emissions avoided due to the use of the PVGCS. The optimization's decision variables are the optimal number of the PV modules, the PV modules optimal tilt angle, the optimal placement of the PV modules within the available installation area and the optimal distribution of the PV modules among the DC/AC converters.

The proposed system fundamentally consists of PV arrays and a single-phase multilevel inverter structure. First, configuration and structural parts of the PV assisted inverter system are introduced in detail. To produce reference output voltage waves, a simple switching strategy based on calculating switching angles is improved. By calculated switching angles, the reference signal is produced as a multilevel shaped output voltage wave. The control algorithm and operational principles of the proposed system are explained. Operating PV arrays in the same load condition is a considerable point; therefore a simulation study is performed to arrange the PV arrays. After determining the number and connection types of the PV arrays, the system is configured through the arrangement of the PV arrays. The validity of the proposed system is verified through simulations and experimental study. The results demonstrate that the system can achieve lower total harmonic distortion (THD) on the output voltage and load current, and it is capable of operating synchronous and transferring power values having different characteristic to the grid. Hence, it is suitable to use the proposed configuration as a PV power conversion system in various applications.

The proposed method predicts the reference PV voltage guarantying optimal power transfer between the PV generator and the main utility grid. The neuro-fuzzy network is composed of a fuzzy rule-based classifier and three multi-layered feed forwarded Artificial Neural Networks (ANN). Inputs of the network (irradiance and temperature) are classified before they are fed into the appropriated ANN for either training or estimation process while the output is the reference voltage. The main advantage of the proposed methodology, comparing to a conventional single neural network-based approach, is the distinct generalization ability regarding to the nonlinear and dynamic behavior of a PV generator. In fact, the neuro-fuzzy network is a neural network based multi-model machine learning that defines a set of local models emulating the complex and nonlinear behavior of a PV generator under a wide range of operating conditions. Simulation results under several rapid irradiance variations proved that the proposed MPPT method fulfilled the highest efficiency comparing to a conventional single neural network and the Perturb and Observe (P and O) algorithm dispositive.

This model accounts for automatic response of the grid to load fluctuations that take place on the scale of minutes, when optimum power flow adjustments and load shedding controls are unavailable. We describe extreme events, caused by load fluctuations, which cause cascading failures of loads, generators and lines. Our model is quasi-static in the causal, discrete time and sequential resolution of individual failures. The model, in its simplest realization based on the Directed Current description of the power flow problem, is tested on three standard IEEE systems consisting of 30, 39 and 118 buses. Our statistical analysis suggests a straightforward classification of cascading and islanding phases in terms of the ratios between average number of removed loads, generators and links. The analysis also demonstrates sensitivity to variations in line capacities. Future research challenges in modeling and control of cascading outages over real-world power networks are discussed.","","","Los Alamos National Lab.

The difference in metal-semiconductor barrier width and height for a planar and NW device is calculated based on the differences in depletion-layer width and image-force barrier-lowering effects. We calculate the ratio of the specific contact resistance of a NW contact to that of a planar contact assuming the two systems have been made of the same material set. Using a modified cylindrical transmission line model, we compare the effects of contacts in the two systems and discuss the reasons for larger contact effects in NW devices. The study suggests that the formation of a higher doping concentration in the contact regions is essential for better NW transistors.","","","Argonne National Lab.

Texas has had to deal with many of these issues beginning in 2002 when it restructured its electricity industry and introduced aggressive renewable portfolio standards that helped spur major investments in wind generation. In this paper we discuss the issues that have arisen in designing market protocols that take account of these special characteristics of wind generation and survey the regulatory and market rules that have been developed in Texas. We discuss the perverse incentives some of the rules gave wind generators to overschedule generation in order to receive balancing energy payments, and steps that have been taken to mitigate those incentive effects. Lastly, we discuss more recent steps taken by the market operator and regulators to ensure transmission capacity is available for new wind generators that are expected to come online in the future.","Elsevier","","National Renewable Energy Lab.

The control method used is the Extended Direct Power Control (EDPC), which is a generic approach for Direct Power Control (DPC) of multilevel inverters based on geometrical considerations. Maximum Power Point Tracking (MPPT) algorithms, that allow maximal power conversion into the grid, have been included. These methods are capable of extracting maximum power from each of the independent PV arrays connected to each DC link voltage level. The first one is a conventional MPPT which outputs DC link voltage references to EDPC. The second one is based on DPC concept. This new MPPT outputs power increment references to EDPC, thus avoiding the use of a DC link voltage regulator. The whole control system has been tested on a three-level NPC voltage source inverter connected to the grid and results confirm the validity of the method.

"Probing Signal Design for Power System Identification","Pierre, John W; Zhou, Ning; Tuffner, Francis K; Hauer, John F; Trudnowski, Daniel J; Mittelstadt, William","24 POWER TRANSMISSION AND DISTRIBUTION; DESIGN; ELECTRICITY; INTERCONNECTED POWER SYSTEMS; POWER SYSTEMS; PROCESSING; RESOLUTION","This paper investigates the design of effective input signals for low-level probing of power systems. In 2005, 2006, and 2008 the Western Electricity Coordinating Council (WECC) conducted four large-scale system wide tests of the western interconnected power system where probing signals were injected by modulating the control signal at the Celilo end of the Pacific DC intertie. A major objective of these tests is the accurate estimation of the inter-area electromechanical modes. A key aspect of any such test is the design of an effective probing signal that leads to measured outputs rich in information about the modes. This paper specifically studies low-level probing signal design for power-system identification. The paper describes the design methodology and the advantages of this new probing signal which was successfully applied during these tests. This probing input is a multi-sine signal with its frequency content focused in the range of the inter-area modes. The period of the signal is over two minutes providing high-frequency resolution. Up to 15 cycles of the signal are injected resulting in a processing gain of 15. The resulting system response is studied in the time and frequency domains. Because of the new probing signal characteristics, these results show significant improvement in the output SNR compared to previous tests.","","","Pacific Northwest National Lab.

Until now, various anti-islanding methods (AIMs) for detecting and preventing islanding of photovoltaic and other distributed generations (DGs) have been proposed. This paper presents an overview of recent anti-islanding method developments for grid-connected photovoltaic (PV) power generation, focusing on the concept and operating principle, mainly based on single phase system. For the performance comparison, the experimental results of the various AIMs with 3 kW PV inverter are provided based on the islanding detection capability and power quality. As a result, the active AIMs have better islanding detection capability rather than the passive one. However, the active AIMs have power quality degradation on harmonic distortion or displacement power factor based on the injected active signal type. In addition to the evaluation and comparison of the main anti-islanding methods, this paper also summarizes the related anti-islanding standards to evaluate anti-islanding capability for PV system. This paper can be used as a useful anti-islanding reference for future work in DG like PV, and wind turbine.

It is used at hydroelectric projects and in the laboratory for evaluating behavior and survival of juvenile salmonids migrating through the Federal Columbia River Power System to the Pacific Ocean. It provides critical data for salmon protection and development of more “fish-friendly” hydroelectric facilities. The objective of this study was to design and build a measurement and calibration system for evaluating the JSATS component, because the JSATS requires comprehensive acceptance and performance testing in a controlled environment before it is deployed in the field. The system consists of a reference transducer, a water test tank lined with anechoic material, a motion control unit, a reference receiver, a signal conditioner and amplifier unit, a data acquisition board, MATLAB control and analysis interface, and a computer. The fully integrated system has been evaluated successfully at various simulated distances and using different encoded signals at frequencies within the bandwidth of the JSATS transmitter. It provides accurate acoustic mapping capability in a controlled environment and automates the process that allows real-time measurements and evaluation of the piezoelectric transducers, sensors, or the acoustic fields. The measurement and calibration system has been in use since 2009 for acceptance and performance testing of, and further improvements to, the JSATS.","","","Pacific Northwest National Lab.

With massive integration in LV grids, a major concern is the possible negative impacts of excess power injection from on-site generation. For power-flow simulations of such grid impacts, an important consideration is the time resolution of demand and generation data. This paper investigates the impact of time averaging on high-resolution data series of domestic electricity demand and PV-DG output and on voltages in a simulated LV grid. Effects of 10-minutely and hourly averaging on descriptive statistics and duration curves were determined. Although time averaging has a considerable impact on statistical properties of the demand in individual households, the impact is smaller on aggregate demand, already smoothed from random coincidence, and on PV-DG output. Consequently, the statistical distribution of simulated grid voltages was also robust against time averaging. The overall judgement is that statistical investigation of voltage variations in the presence of PV-DG does not require higher resolution than hourly.

The high critical current density of the HTS layer in 2G wires reduces the surface superconductor hysteretic losses, for which a new formula is derived. Instead, gap and polygonal losses, flux transfer losses in imbalanced two-layer cables and ferromagnetic losses for wires with NiW substrates constitute the principal contributions. A formula for the flux transfer losses is also derived with a paramagnetic approximation for the substrate. Current imbalance and losses associated with the magnetic substrate can be minimized by orienting the substrates of the inner winding inward and the outer winding outward.","IOP Publishing","","Ames Lab., Ames, IA (United States)","USDOE Office of Science (SC)","","United States","2010-02-22T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: Superconductor Science and Technology; Journal Volume: 23; Journal Issue: 3","","Medium: X; Size: Article No. 034014","","IS-J 7548","DE-AC02-07CH11358","Journal ID: ISSN 0953-2048; TRN: US201009%%512","10.1088/0953-2048/23/3/034014","","2016-04-29T00:00:00Z","976055","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/976055","","Superconductor Science and Technology","3","23"
"Evaluating the impacts of real-time pricing on the usage of wind generation","Sioshansi, Ramteen; Short, Walter","17 WIND ENERGY; 24 POWER TRANSMISSION AND DISTRIBUTION; power system economics; wind power generation; variable renewable energy resources; real-time pricing; unit commitment","One of the impediments to large-scale use of wind generation within power systems is its nondispatchability and variable and uncertain real-time availability. Operating constraints on conventional generators such as minimum generation points, forbidden zones, and ramping limits as well as system constraints such as power flow limits and ancillary service requirements may force a system operator to curtail wind generation in order to ensure feasibility. Furthermore, the pattern of wind availability and electricity demand may not allow wind generation to be fully utilized in all hours. One solution to these issues, which could reduce these inflexibilities, is the use of real-time pricing (RTP) tariffs which can both smooth-out the diurnal load pattern in order to reduce the impact of binding unit operating and system constraints on wind utilization, and allow demand to increase in response to the availability of costless wind generation. As a result, we use and analyze a detailed unit commitment model of the Texas power system with different estimates of demand elasticities to demonstrate the potential increases in wind generation from implementing RTP.","IEEE","","National Renewable Energy Lab.

Transcripts of conversations were analyzed to reveal and assess NDM-based performance criteria. Findings/Design – An item analysis indicated that the operators’ Situation Awareness Levels, mental models, and mental simulations can be mapped at different points in the training scenario. This may identify improved training methods or analytical/ visualization tools. Originality/Value – This study applies for the first time, the concepts of Recognition Primed Decision Making, Situation Awareness Levels and Cognitive Task Analysis to training of electric power system operators.

The rf-driven multicusp ion source that originates from the Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory has been delivering 38 mA H beam in the linac at 60 Hz, 0.9 ms. To improve availability, a rf-driven external antenna multicusp ion source with a water-cooled ceramic aluminum nitride AlN plasma chamber is developed. Computer modeling and simulations have been made to analyze and optimize the rf performance of the new ion source. Operational statistics and test runs with up to 56 mA medium energy beam transport beam current identify the 2 MHz rf system as a limiting factor in the system availability and beam production. Plasma ignition system is under development by using a separate 13 MHz system. To improve the availability of the rf power system with easier maintenance, we tested a 70 kV isolation transformer for the 80 kW, 6% duty cycle 2 MHz amplifier to power the ion source from a grounded solid-state amplifier. 2010 American Institute of Physics.","","","Oak Ridge National Lab.

In particular, local voltage regulation has drawn much attention in regards to power system reliability and voltage stability, especially from past major cascading outages. This paper addresses the challenges of controlling DEs to regulate local voltage in distribution systems. An adaptive voltage control method has been proposed to dynamically modify control parameters to respond to system changes. Theoretical analysis shows that there exists a corresponding formulation of the dynamic control parameters; hence the adaptive control method is theoretically solid. Both simulation and field experiment test results at the Distributed Energy Communications and Controls (DECC) Laboratory confirm that this method is capable of satisfying the fast response requirement for operational use without causing oscillation, inefficiency, or system equipment interference. Since this method has a high tolerance to real-time data shortage and is widely adaptive to variable power system operational situations, it is quite suitable for broad utility application.","","","Oak Ridge National Lab.

An instantaneous power theory is adopted for real-time calculation and control. Three control schemes, current control, voltage control, and integrated control are proposed to compensate the unbalance of current, voltage, or both. The compensation results of the different control schemes in unbalance cases (load unbalance or voltage source unbalance) are compared and analyzed. The simulation and experimental results show that the control schemes can compensate the unbalance in load current or in the voltage source. Different compensation objectives can be achieved, i.e., balanced and unity power factor source current, balanced and regulated voltage, or both, by choosing appropriate control schemes.","","","Oak Ridge National Lab.

All parameters needed to create the model are clearly defined to ensure convergence and maximize accuracy.

The natural ferromagnetic resonance (FMR) frequencies for the two samples are about 8.5 and 11.5 GHz. A 50 mA dc produces a FMR frequency reduction of about 1 GHz in both samples. We extracted susceptibility spectra for the samples from the measurement data. We studied inductance variations of Py embedded transmission lines for different dc levels. With 50 mA dc, the operational frequencies of the inductances decreased by 9% and 12.5%. We also tested effects of magnetic fields generated by external magnets on the submicrometer patterns for comparison. To obtain the same magnetization rotation angle, the external magnetic field needs to be about five times larger than the Ampere field created by the direct current. This behavior is unique and may be associated with the increased thermal energy from the Joule heating effects.","","","Argonne National Lab.

Prior work on visualizing electric power systems has been limited to depicting raw or processed information on top of a geographic layout. Little effort has been devoted to maximize the analytical strengths naturally gained by the visualization itself. This paper introduces a visualization system prototype, known as GreenGrid, that explores the planning and monitoring of the North American Electricity Infrastructure. For the purposes of visualization, the power infrastructure can be described as a network of nodes and links. The nodes represent the electrical buses where generators and loads are connected, while the links represent the transmission lines that interconnect the buses. This paper focuses mainly on a customized technique within GreenGrid that is designed to visually identify abnormal characteristics of the electricity infrastructure. In particular, we examine an extreme event that occurred within the Western United States power grid on August 10, 1996. We compare our study results with the conclusion of the post-disturbance analysis and find that many of the disturbance characteristics can be readily identified with the proper form of visualization. The paper includes a lessons learned discussion to evaluate the visualization application.","","","Pacific Northwest National Lab.

Because this class of steels is the leading structural material for test blankets in ITER and future fusion power systems, the range of ongoing research activities is extremely broad. Since it is not possible to discuss all relevant work in this brief review, the objective of this paper is to highlight significant issues that have received recent attention. These include 1) efforts to measure and understand radiation-induced hardening and embrittlement at temperatures ≤ 400 °C, 2) experiments and modeling to characterize the effects of He on microstructural evolution and mechanical properties, 3) exploration of approaches for increasing the high-temperature (> 550 °C) creep resistance by introduction of a high-density of nanometer scale dispersoids or precipitates in the microstructure, 4) progress toward structural design criteria to account for loading conditions involving both creep and fatigue, and 5) development of nondestructive examination methods for flaw detection and evaluation.","","","Pacific Northwest National Lab.

These tests used a Wide Area Measurement System (WAMS) based primarily on Phasor Measurement Units (PMUs) to determine response to events including the insertion of the 1400-MW Chief Joseph braking resistor, probing signals, and ambient events. Test security was reinforced through real-time analysis of wide area effects, and high-quality data provided dynamic profiles for interarea modes across the entire western interconnection. The tests established that low-level optimized pseudo-random ±20-MW probing with the Pacific DC Intertie (PDCI) roughly doubles the apparent noise that is natural to the power system, providing sharp dynamic information with negligible interference to system operations. Such probing is an effective alternative to use of the 1400-MW Chief Joseph dynamic brake, and it is under consideration as a standard means for assessing dynamic security.","","","Pacific Northwest National Lab.

Charged vehicles can run on the stored energy when needed. A recent study by the Pacific Northwest National Laboratory concluded that some 73 percent of U.S. light vehicles can be supplied with the existing utility infrastructure in place, provided the charging was restricted to off-peak periods. That would reduce U.S. oil imports by 6.2 million barrels per day, roughly 52 percent of U.S. oil imports. The limiting factors increasingly appear to be on the utility side, for example, making sure that the vehicles are charged during off-peak hours at discounted prices.","","Available from: http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.tej.2008.12.019","","","","United States","2009-01-15T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: Electricity Journal; Journal Volume: 22; Journal Issue: 1; Other Information: Elsevier Ltd.

Nowhere has this personal power surge been more evident than in today's U.S Warfighter. The modern Warfighter is estimated to carry from 65 to 95 pounds of supplies in the field with over 30 pounds of this dedicated to portable power devices. These devices include computer displays, infrared sights, Global Positioning Systems (GPS), night vision and a variety of other sensor technologies. Over 80% of the energy needed to power these devices comes from primary (disposable) batteries. It is estimated that a brigade will consume as much as 7 tons of batteries in a 72 hour mission at a cost of $700,000. A recent comprehensive study on the energy needs of the future warrior published by the National Academy of Science in 2004 made a variety of recommendations for average power systems from 20 to 1,000 watts. For lower power systems recommendations included pursuing science and technology initiatives focused on: (1) 300 watt-hours per kilogram (Wh/kg) secondary battery technologies; (2) smart hybrids; and (3) fuel cells (with greater than 6 wt% hydrogen storage). Improved secondary (rechargeable) batteries may be the ideal solution for military power systems due to their ease of use and public acceptance. However, a 3X improvement in their specific energy density is not likely anytime soon. Today's Lithium Ion batteries, at about 150 Wh/kg, fall well short of the energy density that is required. Future battery technology may not be the answer since many experts do not predict more than a 2X improvement in Lithium battery systems over the next 10 years. That is why most auto companies have abandoned all electric vehicles in favor of fuel cells and hybrid vehicles. Fuel cells have very high specific energy densities but achieving high energy values will depend on the energy density and the storage method of its fuel. Improved methods of safely and efficiently storing larger amounts of hydrogen will be a key development area for portable fuel cell power systems. Despite their high potential energy, fuel cells exhibit low power densities. That is why many systems today are going hybrid. Hybrid systems typically combine low energy and high power components with high energy and low power components. Typical configurations include capacitors and fuel cells or batteries and fuel cells. If done correctly, a hybrid system often can have both high energy and high power density even higher than any of the individual components.","","available","Savannah River Site (SRS), Aiken, SC (United States)","USDOE","","United States","2009-01-06T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: Weapon Systems Technology Information Analysis Center Quarterly","","Medium: ED","","SRNL-MS-2009-0001","DE-AC09-08SR22470","TRN: US201006%%998","","","2010-04-15T00:00:00Z","972208","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/972208","https://www.osti.gov/servlets/purl/972208","Weapon Systems Technology Information Analysis Center Quarterly","",""

"The Balanced Billing Cycle Vehicle Routing Problem","Groer, Christopher S; Golden, Bruce; Edward, Wasil","24 POWER TRANSMISSION AND DISTRIBUTION; 32 ENERGY CONSERVATION, CONSUMPTION, AND UTILIZATION; ALGORITHMS; PERFORMANCE; ELECTRIC UTILITIES; VEHICLES; ROUTING; POWER METERS; DATA ACQUISITION","Utility companies typically send their meter readers out each day of the billing cycle in order to determine each customer s usage for the period. Customer churn requires the utility company to periodically remove some customer locations from its meter-reading routes. On the other hand, the addition of new customers and locations requires the utility company to add newstops to the existing routes. A utility that does not adjust its meter-reading routes over time can find itself with inefficient routes and, subsequently, higher meter-reading costs. Furthermore, the utility can end up with certain billing days that require substantially larger meter-reading resources than others. However, remedying this problem is not as simple as it may initially seem. Certain regulatory and customer service considerations can prevent the utility from shifting a customer s billing day by more than a few days in either direction. Thus, the problem of reducing the meterreading costs and balancing the workload can become quite difficult. We describe this Balanced Billing Cycle Vehicle Routing Problem in more detail and develop an algorithm for providing solutions to a slightly simplified version of the problem. Our algorithm uses a combination of heuristics and integer programming via a three-stage algorithm. We discuss the performance of our procedure on a real-world data set.","","","Oak Ridge National Lab.

Future cable projects will utilize second generation (2G) wire which is expected to become lower in cost but may have different thermal requirements than first generation (1G) BSCCO wire due to the lower critical temperature and to a lesser extent, the lower thermal conductivity of the wire.

Reciprocating wear tests were conducted under lubricated and non-lubricated conditions on three spheroidal cast irons which varied in strength and hardness (designated GGG450, GGG600, and GGG700). Hemispherically-tipped steel pins (designed 42CrMoS4/ 41CrS4) were used as the sliders. Except for the test duration, test procedures were similar to those described in ASTM Standard Test Method G133 for linearly-reciprocating sliding. Among the three cast irons tested, the harder and stronger the alloy, the lower was its wear rate. Wear factors were approximately four orders of magnitude lower for experiments lubricated in fresh, fully-formulated lubricating oil. There was a linear relationship between Brinell hardness of the alloys and the negative logarithm of the wear factors that were expressed in (mm3/N-m). Wear of lubricated test pins was not measurable due to the presence of deposits; however under non-lubricated sliding, the ratio of the wear of the flat specimen to that of the pin decreased as the hardness of the flat specimens approached that of the pin specimen.","","","Oak Ridge National Lab.

To simulate realistic markets, our model issues control signals only at given times and those signals are delayed during transmission. These two effects transform Alvarado's continuous system into a hybrid system, with consequential effects. The stability analysis of the new system reveals two important properties. First, there is an upper limit on the market clearing time and the delay of the price signal beyond which the system becomes unstable. Second, there is a counter-intuitive relationship between the market clearing time and price signal delay: when the market clearing time is relatively long, delaying the price signal can improve the market's stability while reducing the communication delay can destabilize the market. This counter-intuitive effect shows that the full impact of information technology on power markets can be significant and difficult to anticipate. Therefore, as markets are designed and regulated, careful attention should be paid to the effects of information technology on the market's dynamic behavior.","","","Oak Ridge National Lab.

However, there is a lack of a systematic approach to quantitatively identify the economic benefit. In addition, with deregulation and restructuring, it is important to indicate the amount of benefit that each market participant may potentially receive given the right price signals. If such information can be easily obtained and presented, it will be more convenient for decision-markers to determine the cost benefit sharing of installing a Var compensator. The vision of this paper is to lay out a possible method for quantitatively evaluating the benefits from local reactive power compensation. The approach is to quantify the benefits into several categories such as reduced losses, shifting reactive power flow to real power flow, and increased transfer. The calculation of these benefits are illustrated with a simple two-bus power system model and then presented with a more complicated model using Optimal Power Flow to calculate the benefits. Simulation on the more complex system is conducted with seven buses in two areas. The simulation results show that the possible economic benefits can be significant, if compared with capacity payments to central generators or payment of power factor penalties applied by utilities. The potential economic value of local Var compensation may give various parties in electricity supply, delivery and end-use consumption a better understanding of the Var benefits to assist their cost-benefit analysis for Var compensation installation. Sensitivity analysis is also provided to illustrate that the benefits may not be monotonically increasing. Also, this paper suggests that the future reactive power market should consider local Var providers or other way to encourage load Var capability, since local Var benefit is significant.","","","Oak Ridge National Lab.

The US DOE Fuel Cell subprogram emphasizes polymer electrolyte membrane (PEM) fuel cells as replacements for internal combustion engines in light-duty vehicles to support the goal of reducing oil use in the transportation sector. PEM fuel cells are the focus for light-duty vehicles because they are capable of rapid start-up, demonstrate high operating efficiency, and can operate at low temperatures. The program also supports fuel cells for stationary power, portable power, and auxiliary power applications where earlier market entry would assist in the development of a fuel cell manufacturing and supplier base. The technical focus is on developing materials and components that enable fuel cells to achieve the fuel cell subprogram objectives, primarily related to system cost and durability. For transportation applications, the performance and cost of a fuel cell vehicle must be comparable or superior to today's gasoline vehicles to achieve widespread penetration into the market and achieve the desired reduction in petroleum consumption. By translating vehicle performance requirements into fuel cell system needs, DOE has defined technical targets for 2010 and 2015. These targets are based on competitiveness with current internal combustion engine vehicles in terms of vehicle performance and cost, while providing improvements in efficiency of a factor of 2.5 to 3. The overall system targets are: a 60% peak-efficient, durable, direct hydrogen fuel cell power system for transportation at a cost of $45/kW by 2010 and $30/kW by 2015. DOE's approach to achieving these technical and cost targets is to improve existing materials and to identify and qualify new materials.","","","Argonne National Lab.

The proposed method utilizes an autoregressive moving average exogenous (ARMAX) model to account for typical measurement data, which includes low-level pseudo-random probing, ambient, and ringdown data. A robust objective function is utilized to reduce the negative influence from non-typical data, which include outliers and missing data. A dynamic regularization method is introduced to help include a priori knowledge about the system and reduce the influence of under-determined problems. Based on a 17-machine simulation model, it is shown through the Monte-Carlo method that the proposed R3LS method can estimate and track electromechani-cal modes by effectively using combined typical and non-typical measurement data.","IEEE","","Pacific Northwest National Lab.

Measurements were made using two different low-power techniques: a coherent technique using a vector network analyzer (VNA) and an incoherent technique using a radiometer. The measured loss in a 140 GHz 12.7 mm diameter TL system, consisting of 1.7 m of circular corrugated waveguide and three miter bends, is dominated by the miter bend loss. The measured loss was 0.3 {+-} 0.1 dB per miter bend using a VNA; and 0.22 {+-} 0.1 dB per miter bend using a radiometer. Good agreement between the two measurement techniques implies that both are useful for measuring small losses. To verify the methodology, the VNA technique was employed to measure the extremely small transmission loss in a 170 GHz ITER prototype TL system consisting of three lengths of 1 m, 63.5 mm diameter, circular corrugated waveguide and two miter bends. The measured loss of 0.05 {+-} 0.02 dB per miter bend may be compared with the theoretical loss of 0.027 dB per miter bend. These results suggest that low-power testing of TL losses, utilizing a small, simple TL system and a VNA, is a reliable method for evaluating performance of low-loss millimeter-wave TL components intended for use in high-power applications.","","","Oak Ridge National Lab.

To understand the relation between structure and electrochemical properties, an alternate approach to de Levi's cylindrical pore, transmission line method was utilized. Using electrochemical impedance spectroscopy, the capacitor can be studied as a dielectric system composed of a porous electrode and the electrolyte (tetraethylammonium tetrafluoroborate in propylene carbonate). The complex capacitance and power are used to study the behavior of the system below the relaxation frequency f{sub 0} ({var_phi} = -45{sup o}). Therefore, the relaxation of the capacitor system at the low frequency range, f&lt;f{sub 0}, may be used as a measure of pore/electrolyte interaction. The approach proposed here also allows for a direct experimental characterization of the capacitance and power at low frequencies, where small pores are likely to affect the diffusion kinetics and dynamics of the electrolyte molecules. The results suggest a correlation between the occurrence of small micropores and that of high power losses that are related to the resistive element at the low frequency range. Moreover, the impact of the micropore structure on the supercapacitor's performance is apparent in its capacitance and energy as well. In addition to the complex power and capacitance, other measurements including nitrogen physisorption, cyclic voltammetry, galvanic cycling, and x-ray Raman scattering were used to characterize the samples and support these results.","","","Argonne National Lab.

This environment produces atomic displacement damage ultimately equivalent to displacing every atom in the material up to about 150 times during its expected service life, as well as changes in chemical composition by transmutation reactions, including the introduction of damaging concentrations of reactive and insoluble gases. Radiation damage degrades materials properties through processes that include hardening, embrittlement, phase instabilities, segregation, precipitation, irradiation creep, volumetric swelling, He embrittlement, and radiation-induced conductivity. A long-standing feasibility issue is the development of structural materials that can tolerate the intense fusion neutron environment. The U. S. Fusion Materials Program is engaged in a science-based effort to develop the scientific understanding of the damage mechanisms controlling performance-limiting phenomena of materials for fusion power systems. The program employs the full suite of experimental and computational tools to explore life limiting materials degradation phenomena in the fusion neutron environment. Our overarching goal is to develop experimentally validated, physics-based, predictive models of complex material behavior that can be used to improve existing materials or to design better ones. To a large extent, structural materials in the fusion blanket region most strongly impact the technical feasibility, economic attractiveness and environmental acceptability of fusion power systems. Therefore research on structural materials is the main focus of the program. To produce an economically attractive fusion reactor, while simultaneously achieving safety and environmental acceptability goals, the program is developing low or reduced activation materials so that when they are removed from service they will not require long-term deep geological disposal and may be recyclable. Only a limited number of materials possess the physical, mechanical and low-activation characteristics required: reduced activation steels, vanadium alloys, and SiC/SiC composites. In the recent past the fusion materials research emphasis was on defect production and migration mechanisms, low-to-intermediate temperature deformation and fracture behavior of these materials, as well as the fundamental effects of irradiation on the electrical and thermal properties of SiC. In the future the program focus will be on investigating the synergistic effects of He, tritium and neutron irradiation on the properties of bonded materials, as well as developing a mechanistic understanding of damage evolution at high-temperatures due to creep, fatigue and creep-fatigue interaction. In this article we choose to highlight recent and ongoing experimental and computational efforts to characterize and understand the effects of He on microstructural evolution in ferritic/martensitic steels, and an important revolutionary class of materials – nanostructured ferritic alloys (NFA).","","","Pacific Northwest National Lab.

However, some alarming experimental counterexamples already exist which show that this boundary is not always convex.

However, this had led to the accelerated aging and degradation of splice connectors, which has been manifested by the formation of hot-spots that have been revealed by infrared imaging during inspection. The implications of connector aging is two-fold: (1) significant increase in resistivity of the splice connector (i.e., less efficient transmission of electricity) and (2) significant reduction in the connector clamping strength, which ultimately results in separation of the power transmission line at the joint. Therefore, the splice connector has become the weakest link in the electric power transmission infrastructure.

"A Framework to Quantify the Economic Benefit from Local VAR Compensation","Li, Fangxing; Zhang, Wenjuan; Tolbert, Leon M; Kueck, John D; Rizy, D Tom","24 POWER TRANSMISSION AND DISTRIBUTION; AVAILABILITY; BUSES; CAPACITY; DEREGULATION; ECONOMICS; ELECTRICITY; MARKET; POWER FACTOR; POWER SYSTEMS; PRICES; SENSITIVITY ANALYSIS; SIMULATION; VAR CONTROL SYSTEMS","Abstract It is generally accepted that reactive power (or Var) compensation will bring benefits for utilities and industrial customers by providing local voltage and power factor support. However, there is a lack of a systematic approach to quantitatively identify the economic benefit. In addition, with the deregulation and restructuring, it is important to indicate the amount of benefit that each market participant may potentially receive given the right price signals. If such information can be easily obtained and presented, it will be more convenient for decision-markers to determine the cost benefit sharing of installing a Var compensator. This vision of this paper is to lay out a possible method for quantitatively evaluating the benefits from local reactive power compensation. The approach is to quantify the benefits into several categories such as reduced losses, shifting reactive power flow to real power flow, and increased transfer. The calculation of these benefits are illustrated with a simple two-bus power system model and then presented with a more complicated model using Optimal Power Flow to calculate the benefits. Simulation on the more complex system is conducted with seven buses in two areas. The simulation results show that the possible economic benefits can be significant, if compared with capacity payments to central generators or payment of power factor penalties applied by utilities. The potential economic value of local Var compensation may give various parties in electricity supply, delivery and end-use consumption a better understanding of the Var benefits to assist their cost-benefit analysis for Var compensation installation. Sensitivity analysis is also provided to illustrate that the benefits may not be monotonically increasing. Also, this paper suggests that the future reactive power market should consider local Var providers or other way to encourage load Var capability, since local Var benefit is significant.","","","Oak Ridge National Lab.

"Using Distributed Energy Resources to Supply Reactive Power for Dynamic Voltage Regulation","Xu, Yan; Li, Fangxing; Li, Huijuan; Rizy, D Tom; Kueck, John D","24 POWER TRANSMISSION AND DISTRIBUTION; INTERCONNECTED POWER SYSTEMS; VOLTAGE REGULATORS; INVERTERS; PERFORMANCE; CONTROL SYSTEMS; OPTIMAL CONTROL; LOAD MANAGEMENT","Abstract Distributed energy (DE) resources are power sources located near load centers and equipped with power electronics converters to interface with the grid, therefore it is feasible for DE to provide reactive power (along with active power) locally for dynamic voltage regulation. In this paper, a synchronous condenser and a DE source with an inverter interface are implemented in parallel in a distribution system to regulate the local voltage. Developed voltage control schemes for the inverter and the synchronous condenser are presented. Experimental results show that both the inverter and the synchronous condenser can regulate the local voltage instantaneously although the dynamic response of the inverter is much faster than the synchronous condenser. In a system with multiple DEs performing local voltage regulation, the interaction of multiple DE at different locations under different load levels may have an impact to the control parameter setting for each individual DE control system. Future research is needed to find out the interaction of DEs to identify the optimal control parameter settings with the consideration of many factors such as system configuration, load variation, and so on","","","Oak Ridge National Lab.

A probe has been developed to determine the in situ integrity of plastic natural gas pipelines that can be installed on a traversing mechanism (pig) to detect abnormalities in the walls of the plastic natural gas pipeline from the interior. This probe has its own internal power source and can be deployed into existing natural gas supply lines.

The system includes 62 gauges: 3 current and 6 voltage monitors that are fielded on each of the accelerator's 4 vacuum-insulator stacks, 6 current monitors on each of the accelerator's 4 outer magnetically insulated transmission lines (MITLs), and 2 current monitors on the accelerator's inner MITL. The inner-MITL monitors are located 6 cm from the axis of the load. Each of the stack and outer-MITL current monitors comprises two separate B-dot sensors, each of which consists of four 3-mm-diameter wire loops wound in series. The two sensors are separately located within adjacent cavities machined out of a single piece of copper. The high electrical conductivity of copper minimizes penetration of magnetic flux into the cavity walls, which minimizes changes in the sensitivity of the sensors on the 100-ns time scale of the accelerator's power pulse. A model of flux penetration has been developed and is used to correct (to first order) the B-dot signals for the penetration that does occur. The two sensors are designed to produce signals with opposite polarities; hence, each current monitor may be regarded as a single detector with differential outputs. Common-mode-noise rejection is achieved by combining these signals in a 50-{Omega} balun. The signal cables that connect the B-dot monitors to the balun are chosen to provide reasonable bandwidth and acceptable levels of Compton drive in the bremsstrahlung field of the accelerator. A single 50-{omega} cable transmits the output signal of each balun to a double-wall screen room, where the signals are attenuated, digitized (0.5-ns/sample), numerically compensated for cable losses, and numerically integrated. By contrast, each inner-MITL current monitor contains only a single B-dot sensor. These monitors are fielded in opposite-polarity pairs. The two signals from a pair are not combined in a balun; they are instead numerically processed for common-mode-noise rejection after digitization. All the current monitors are calibrated on a 76-cm-diameter axisymmetric radial transmission line that is driven by a 10-kA current pulse. The reference current is measured by a current-viewing resistor (CVR). The stack voltage monitors are also differential-output gauges, consisting of one 1.8-cm-diameter D-dot sensor and one null sensor. Hence, each voltage monitor is also a differential detector with two output signals, processed as described above. The voltage monitors are calibrated in situ at 1.5 MV on dedicated accelerator shots with a short-circuit load. Faraday's law of induction is used to generate the reference voltage: currents are obtained from calibrated outer-MITL B-dot monitors, and inductances from the system geometry. In this way, both current and voltage measurements are traceable to a single CVR. Dependable and consistent measurements are thus obtained with this system of calibrated diagnostics. On accelerator shots that deliver 22 MA to a low-impedance z-pinch load, the peak lineal current densities at the stack, outer-MITL, and inner-MITL monitor locations are 0.5, 1, and 58 MA/m, respectively. On such shots the peak currents measured at these three locations agree to within 1%.","","","Sandia National Laboratories (SNL), Albuquerque, NM, and Livermore, CA (United States)","USDOE","","United States","2007-12-01T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: Proposed for publication in Physical Review Special Topics - Accelerators and Beams.","","Medium: X; Size: 60 p.","","SAND2007-7793J","AC04-94AL85000","TRN: US0900982","","","2009-12-16T00:00:00Z","946569","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/946569","","Proposed for publication in Physical Review Special Topics - Accelerators and Beams.","",""

The measurement data can either be ambient or ringdown. Also, the mode estimation is provided in real-time. The validity of the proposed RRLS algorithm is demon-strated with both simulation data from a 17-machine model and field measurement data from a Wide Area Measurement System (WAMS). Comparison with the conventional Recursive Least Square (RLS) and Least Means Square (LMS) algorithms shows that the proposed RRLS algorithm can identify the modes from the combined ringdown and ambient signals with outliers and missing data in real time without noticeable performance degra-dation. An adaptive detrend algorithm is also proposed to remove the signal trend based on the RRLS algorithm. It is shown that the algorithm can keep up with the measurement data flow and work on-line to provide real time mode estimation.","","","Pacific Northwest National Lab.

In work performed at the Ernest Orlando Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory (Berkeley, CA, 5 10-486-577 1)--a US Department of Energy national laboratory that conducts unclassified scientific research and is managed by the University of California--scientist Scott McHugo has obtained keen insights into the impaired performance of solar cells manufactured from polycrystalline silicon. The solar cell market is potentially vast, according to Berkeley Lab. Lightweight solar panels are highly beneficial for providing electrical power to remote locations in developing nations, since there is no need to build transmission lines or truck-in generator fuel. Moreover, industrial nations confronted with diminishing resources have active programs aimed at producing improved, less expensive solar cells. 'In a solar cell, there is a junction between p-type silicon and an n-type layer, such as diffused-in phosphorous', explained McHugo, who is now with Berkeley Lab's Accelerator and Fusion Research Division. 'When sunlight is absorbed, it frees electrons, which start migrating in a random-walk fashion toward that junction. If the electrons make it to the junction; they contribute to the cell's output of electric current. Often, however, before they reach the junction, they recombine at specific sites in the crystal' (and, therefore, cannot contribute to current output). McHugo scrutinized a map of a silicon wafer in which sites of high recombination appeared as dark regions. Previously, researchers had shown that such phenomena occurred not primarily at grain boundaries in the polycrystalline material, as might be expected, but more often at dislocations in the crystal. However, the dislocations themselves were not the problem. Using a unique heat treatment technique, McHugo performed electrical measurements to investigate the material at the dislocations. He was purportedly the first to show that they were 'decorated' with iron.","","","Lawrence Berkeley National Lab.

Thus it is hard to speed up “state estimation,” the procedure used to estimate the status of the power grid from measured input. State estimation is the core of grid operations, including contingency analysis, automatic generation control, and optimal power flow. How fast state estimation and contingency analysis are conducted (currently about every 5 minutes) needs to be increased radically so the analysis of contingencies is comprehensive and is conducted in real time. Further, traditional state estimation is based on a power flow model and only provides a static snapshot—a tiny piece of the state of a large-scale dynamic machine. Bringing dynamic aspects into real-time grid operations poses an even bigger challenge. Working with the latest, most advanced computing techniques and hardware, researchers at Pacific Northwest National Laboratory (PNNL) intend to transform grid operations by increasing computational speed and improving accuracy. Traditional power grid computation is conducted on single PC hardware platforms. This article shows how traditional power grid computation can be reformulated to take advantage of advanced computing techniques and be converted to high-performance computing platforms (e.g., PC clusters, reconfigurable hardware, scalable multicore shared memory computers, or multithreaded architectures). The improved performance is expected to have a huge impact on how power grids are operated and managed and ultimately will lead to more reliability and better asset utilization to the power industry.

The smallest eigenvalue of the matrix defines the mode of harmonic resonance. This paper applies this eigenvalue theory and proposes a method to determine which network components have significant contributions to a harmonic resonance phenomenon. The basic idea is to calculate the sensitivities of a resonance mode to the parameters of network components. The sensitivity results are then ranked to quantify the impact of each component. In this paper, the eigen-sensitivity theory as applied to harmonic resonance mode analysis is presented. Case studies are used to verify the theory. A practical example is given to illustrate the application of the proposed method. In addition, this paper further conducts extensive comparative analysis on three types of network oriented modal analysis techniques. The results have clarified the similarities and differences among the techniques.","","","Pacific Northwest National Lab.

The process for establishing the flexible laboratory control and data acquisition system that allows for the integration of multiple Distributed Energy (DE) devices in XXXX Laboratory's Distributed Energy - Communications and Controls Laboratory (DECC) is discussed. The DE devices control local distribution system voltage through dynamic reactive power production. Although original efforts were made to control the reactive power (RP) output using information from commercially available meters specifically designed for monitoring and analyzing electric power values, these ""intelligent"" meters did not provide the flexibility needed. A very flexible and capable real-time monitoring and control system was selected after the evaluation of various methods of data acquisition (DAQ) and control. The purpose of this paper is to describe the DAQ and controls system development. The chosen controller is a commercially available real-time controller from dSPACE. This controller has many excellent features including a very easy programming platform through Simulink and Matlab's Real Time Workshop. The dSPACE system proved to provide both the flexibility and expandability needed to integrate and control the RP producing devices under consideration. The desire was to develop controls with this flexible laboratory instrumentation and controls setup that could be eventually be included in an embedded controller on a DE device. Some experimental results are included that clearly show that some functional control strategies are currently being tested.","","","Oak Ridge National Lab.

"Complex systems analysis of series of blackouts: cascading failure, critical points, and self-organization","Dobson, Ian; Carreras, Benjamin A; Lynch, Vickie E; Newman, David E","24 POWER TRANSMISSION AND DISTRIBUTION; CRITICALITY; ECONOMICS; ELECTRIC POWER; MITIGATION; OUTAGES; POWER SYSTEMS; STATISTICS; SYSTEMS ANALYSIS","We give an overview of a complex systems approach to large blackouts of electric power transmission systems caused by cascading failure. Instead of looking at the details of particular blackouts, we study the statistics and dynamics of series of blackouts with approximate global models. Blackout data from several countries suggest that the frequency of large blackouts is governed by a power law. The power law makes the risk of large blackouts consequential and is consistent with the power system being a complex system designed and operated near a critical point. Power system overall loading or stress relative to operating limits is a key factor affecting the risk of cascading failure. Power system blackout models and abstract models of cascading failure show critical points with power law behavior as load is increased. To explain why the power system is operated near these critical points and inspired by concepts from self-organized criticality, we suggest that power system operating margins evolve slowly to near a critical point and confirm this idea using a power system model. The slow evolution of the power system is driven by a steady increase in electric loading, economic pressures to maximize the use of the grid, and the engineering responses to blackouts that upgrade the system. Mitigation of blackout risk should account for dynamical effects in complex self-organized critical systems. For example, some methods of suppressing small blackouts could ultimately increase the risk of large blackouts.","","","Oak Ridge National Lab.

Y.; Selvamanickam, V.","24 POWER TRANSMISSION AND DISTRIBUTION; AC LOSSES; CRITICAL CURRENT; CURRENT DENSITY; DEPOSITION; LASERS; NUMERICAL ANALYSIS; SPLICING; STABILITY; ac loss; YBCO tapes; filamentization; conductor stability","Reduction of ac losses in applied ac fields can be accomplished through either the creation of filaments and bridging in YBCO coated conductors or an assembly of narrow width YBCO tapes. The ac losses for each of these geometries were measured at 77 K in perpendicular ac fields up to 100 mT. While ac loss reduction was achieved with YBCO filaments created through laser scribing and inkjet deposition, the assembly of stacked YBCO conductor provides an alternative method of ac loss reduction. When compared to a 4-mm wide YBCO coated conductor with a critical current of 60 A, the ac loss in a stack of 2-mm wide YBCO coated conductors with a similar total critical current was reduced. While the reduction in ac loss in a 2-mm wide stack coincided with the reduction in the engineering current density of the conductor, further reduction of ac loss was obtained through the splicing of the 2-mm wide tapes with low resistance solders. To better determine the practicality of these methods from a stability point of view, a numerical analysis was carried out to determine the influence of bridging and splicing on stability of a YBCO coated conductor for both liquid nitrogen-cooled and conduction cooled geometries.","","","Oak Ridge National Lab.

Large wind generation facilities are necessarily evolving to look more and more like conventional generating plants in terms of their ability to interact with the transmission network in a way that does not compromise performance or system reliability. Such an evolution has only been possible through the cumulative contributions of an ever-growing number of power system engineers who have delved into the unique technologies and technical challenges presented by wind generation. The industry is still only part of the way up the learning curve, however. Numerous technical challenges remain, and as has been found, each new wind generation facility has the potential to generate some new questions.

Meanwhile, the fragrance of fresh-brewed coffee fills the house. You hear a momentary beep from the dryer that tells you that if you were to look, a high-energy price indicator would be displayed on the front panels of some of your favorite appliances. This tells you that you could save money right now by using less energy. (You’ve agreed to this arrangement to help your utility avoid a substation upgrade. In return, you get a lower rate most of the time.) So you turn off some of the unneeded lights in your home and opt to wait until evening to run the dishwasher. Meanwhile, some of your largest appliances have automatically responded to this signal and have already reduced your home’s energy consumption, saving you money. On January 11, 2006, demonstration projects were launched in 200 homes in the Pacific Northwest region of the United States to test and speed adoption of new smart grid technologies that can make the power grid more resilient and efficient. Pacific Northwest National Laboratory, a U.S. Department of Energy national laboratory in Richland, Washington, is managing the yearlong study called the Pacific Northwest GridWise™ Testbed Demonstration, a project funded primarily by DOE. Through the GridWise™ Demonstration projects, researchers are gaining insight into energy consumers’ behavior while testing new technologies designed to bring the electric transmission system into the information age. Northwest utilities, appliance manufacturers and technology companies are also supporting this effort to demonstrate the devices and assess the resulting consumer response. A combination of devices, software and advanced analytical tools will give homeowners more information about their energy use and cost, and we want to know if this will modify their behavior. Approximately 100 homes on the Olympic Peninsula in Washington State receive energy price information through a broadband Internet connection and have received automated demand-response thermostats and water heaters that can adjust energy use based on price. Fifty of those homes and an additional 50 homes in Yakima, Washington, and 50 homes in Gresham, Oregon, have computer chips helping control their dryers. These chips sense when the power transmission system is under stress and automatically turn off certain functions briefly until the grid can be stabilized by power operators.","","","Pacific Northwest National Lab.

"Postmortem analysis of power grid blackouts - The role of measurement systems","Dagle, Jeffery E","24 POWER TRANSMISSION AND DISTRIBUTION; POWER TRANSMISSION; OUTAGES; FAILURE MODE ANALYSIS; ON-LINE MEASUREMENT SYSTEMS; PERFORMANCE","Promptly following any blackout, an investigation is conducted to determine the who, what, where, when, why, and how. For system operators, it is important to quickly grasp the scale and magnitude of the event and rapidly restore service. Then a broader set of stakeholders get involved to assess system performance, determine root causes, compile lessons learned, and develop recommendations. At the heart of the post-mortem investigation is the detailed sequence of events. As accurately as possible, investigators need to know what happened and when. Especially during a cascading failure where events occur rapidly, accurate timing is crucial to understanding how the event unfolded so that the root causes can be determined. The sequence of events is based on vast amounts of data collected from multiple points in the system from a myriad of data collection instruments, some devoted to the purpose of supporting system disturbance post mortem analysis, others providing useful additional context or filling in missing gaps. The more that the investigators know about their available sources of data, and the inherent limitations of each, the better (and quicker) will be the analysis. This is especially important when a large blackout has occurred; there is pressure to find answers quickly, but due to the size and complexity of the event, a deliberate and methodical investigation is necessary. This article discusses the role that system monitoring plays in supporting the investigation of large-scale system disruptions and blackouts.","","","Pacific Northwest National Lab.

The data were obtained during tests on June 7, 2000, and they represent wide area response to several kinds of probing signals including Low-Level Pseudo-Random Noise (LLPRN) and Single-Mode Square Wave (SMSW) injected at the Celilo terminal of the Pacific HVDC In-tertie (PDCI). An identified model is validated using a cross vali-dation method. Also, the obtained electromechanical modes are compared with the results from Prony analysis of a ringdown and with signal analysis of ambient data measured under similar op-erating conditions. The consistent results show that methods in this class can be highly effective even when the probing signal is small.","","","Pacific Northwest National Lab.

Dynamic simulation results obtained using a representative distribution system confirm the validity and accuracy. The formulas presented are a useful tool for protection engineers; they can be used, for example, to assess the effectiveness of anti-islanding schemes based on ROCOF relays, or to assist the selection of relay settings, significantly reducing the number of repeated dynamic simulations necessary to carry out such studies.","","","Pacific Northwest National Lab.

This system can eliminate problems associated with wind intermittency and provide a source of electrical energy functionally equivalent to a large fossil or nuclear power plant. Compressed air energy storage (CAES) can be economically deployed in the Midwestern US, an area with significant low-cost wind resources. CAES systems require a combustible fuel, typically natural gas, which results in fuel price risk and greenhouse gas emissions. Replacing natural gas with synfuel derived from biomass gasification eliminates the use of fossil fuels, virtually eliminating net CO{sub 2} emissions from the system. In addition, by deriving energy completely from farm sources, this type of system may reduce some opposition to long distance transmission lines in rural areas, which may be an obstacle to large-scale wind deployment.","","","National Renewable Energy Lab.

CF8C plus steel has improved high temperature tensile, creep, fatigue, and creep-fatigue properties compared with standard CF8C steel. Changes to the CF8C steel composition, including additions of Mn and N, result in changes to the solidification behaviour and final microstructure of the alloy, which directly relate to the improved mechanical properties. Additionally, CF8C plus is a relatively inexpensive steel which exhibits good castability. The mechanical properties of the alloy have generated significant interest for the production/design of cast components for diesel engine turbochargers and other exhaust components, natural gas reciprocating engines for distributed power, and turbine end covers and casings for land based turbines. In the present paper, the microstructural evolution of CF8C and CF8C plus are presented in more detail, and the mechanical properties of the alloys are compared with each other and other engineering alloys.","","","Oak Ridge National Lab.

Which method has least social cost depends on how much additional investment in rail line, transmission, or pipeline infrastructure is required, as well as how much and how far energy is transported. If the existing rail lines have unused capacity, coal by rail is the cheapest method (up to 200 miles of additional track could be added). If no infrastructure exists, greater distances and larger amounts of energy favor coal by rail and gasified coal by pipeline over electricity transmission. For 1,000 miles and 9 gigawatts of power, a gas pipeline is cheapest, has less environmental discharges, uses less land, and is least obtrusive. 28 refs., 4 figs., 3 tabs.","","","","","","United States","2005-08-15T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: Environmental Science and Technology; Journal Volume: 39; Journal Issue: 16; Other Information: lave@cmu.edu","","Medium: X; Size: page(s) 5905-5910","","","","Journal ID: ISSN 0013-936X; ESTHAG; TRN: 001000277","10.1021/es048981t","","2010-06-03T00:00:00Z","20647749","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/20647749","","Environmental Science and Technology","16","39"

Microwave vacuum windows for modern high power sources and transmission lines operating at the megawatt power level require high quality diamond disks with a diameter of several centimeters and a thickness of a few millimeters. The microwave plasma-assisted CVD technique exploited today to produce such disks has low deposition rate, which limits the availability of large size diamond disk windows. High-electron-density plasma generated by the millimeter-wave power was suggested for enhanced-growth-rate CVD. In this paper a general description of the 30 GHz gyrotron-based facility is presented. The output radiation of the gyrotron is converted into four wave-beams. Free localized plasma in the shape of a disk with diameter much larger than the wavelength of the radiation is formed in the intersection area of the wave-beams. The results of investigation of the plasma parameters, as well as the first results of diamond film deposition are presented. The prospects for commercially producing vacuum window diamond disks for high power microwave devices at much lower costs and processing times than currently available are outlined.","","","Lawrence Livermore National Lab.

In comparison with conventional power generation technologies, fuel cells potentially offer high chemical to electrical conversion efficiency, modular construction, high quality waste heat, and lower pollutants emissions. Among the various types of fuel cells being developed, solid oxide fuel cells (SOFCs) have several advantages over other types of fuel cells, such as alkaline, polymer and molten carbonate. Advantages include fuel flexibility, solid state construction, an invariant (solid) electrolyte, high quality waste heat, and the absence of precious metals. However, a number of challenges must be overcome before SOFC-based power systems can be considered a viable alternative in the power generation marketplace. Many of these challenges are related to the severe demands that this technology places on the materials from which SOFC cells and stacks are constructed due to their high operating temperature (typically 600-1000 C). Considerable progress will be required in terms to materials of construction, fabrication techniques, and design for the performance and cost goals necessary for large-scale commercialization to be achieved.","","","Pacific Northwest National Lab.

This paper discusses the modeling of uncertainties in aggregated thermostatically controlled loads using a state queueing (SQ) model. The cycling times of thermostatically controlled appliances (TCAs) vary with the TCA types and sizes, as well as the ambient temperatures. The random consumption of consumers, which besides phase shifting, shortens or prolongs a specific TCA cycling period, introduces another degree of uncertainty. By modifying the state transition matrix, these random factors can be taken into account in a discrete SQ model. The impacts of considering load diversity in the SQ model on simulating TCA setpoint response are also studied.","","","Pacific Northwest National Lab.

The analysis is based on the concepts of detection-time versus active power-imbalance curves and critical active power imbalance. Such curves are obtained through dynamic simulations. The performance of these devices considering different scenarios is determined and compared. Factors such as voltage-dependent loads, generator inertia constant and multi-distributed generator system are analyzed. False operation of these relays due to faults in adjacent feeders is also addressed. Results show that ROCOF relays are more reliable to detect islanding than vector surge relays when the active power imbalance in the islanded system is small. However, ROCOF relays are more susceptible to false operation than vector surge relays.","","","Pacific Northwest National Lab.

As the electromagnetic pulse propagates along the transmission line, it is subject to impedance by the dielectric properties of the media along the transmission line (e.g., air, water, and sediment), reflection at dielectric discontinuities (e.g., air-water or water-sediment interface), and attenuation by electrically conductive materials (e.g., salts and clays). Taken together, these characteristics provide a basis for integrated stream monitoring, specifically, concurrent measurement of stream stage, channel profile, and aqueous conductivity. Requisite for such application is a means of extracting the desired stream parameters from measured TDR traces. Analysis is complicated by the fact that interface location and aqueous conductivity vary concurrently and multiple interfaces may be present at any time. For this reason a physically based multisection model employing the S11 scatter function and Debeye parameters for dielectric dispersion and loss is used to analyze acquired TDR traces. Here we explore the capability of this multisection modeling approach for interpreting TDR data acquired from complex environments, such as encountered in stream monitoring. A series of laboratory tank experiments was performed in which the depth of water, depth of sediment, and conductivity were varied systematically. Comparisons between modeled and independently measured data indicate that TDR measurements can be made with an accuracy of {+-} 3.4 x 10{sup -3} m for sensing the location of an air-water or water-sediment interface and {+-} 7.4% of actual for the aqueous conductivity.","","","Sandia National Laboratories (SNL), Albuquerque, NM, and Livermore, CA (United States)","USDOE","","United States","2005-03-01T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: Proposed for publication in Water Resources Research.","","Medium: X; Size: 34 p.","","SAND2005-2007J","AC04-94AL85000","TRN: US200909%%511","10.1029/2004WR003416","","2009-12-16T00:00:00Z","949844","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/949844","","Proposed for publication in Water Resources Research.","",""

"Use of Time-Aggregated Data in Economic Screening Analyses of Combined Heat and Power Systems","Hudson, II, Carl Randy","24 POWER TRANSMISSION AND DISTRIBUTION; COGENERATION; DAILY VARIATIONS; ECONOMICS; EVALUATION; MANAGEMENT; POWER SYSTEMS; SIMULATION; VIABILITY","Combined heat and power (CHP) projects (also known as cogeneration projects) usually undergo a series of assessments and viability checks before any commitment is made. A screening analysis, with electrical and thermal loads characterized on an annual basis, may be performed initially to quickly determine the economic viability of the proposed project. Screening analyses using time-aggregated data do not reflect several critical cost influences, however. Seasonal and diurnal variations in electrical and thermal loads, as well as time-of-use utility pricing structures, can have a dramatic impact on the economics. A more accurate economic assessment requires additional detailed data on electrical and thermal demand (e.g., hourly load data), which may not be readily available for the specific facility under study. Recent developments in CHP evaluation tools, however, can generate the needed hourly data through the use of historical data libraries and building simulation. This article utilizes model-generated hourly load data for four potential CHP applications and compares the calculated cost savings of a CHP system when evaluated on a time-aggregated (i.e., annual) basis to the savings when evaluated on an hour-by-hour basis. It is observed that the simple, aggregated analysis forecasts much greater savings (i.e., greater economic viability) than the more detailed hourly analysis. The findings confirm that the simpler tool produces results with a much more optimistic outlook, which, if taken by itself, might lead to erroneous project decisions. The more rigorous approach, being more reflective of actual requirements and conditions, presents a more accurate economic comparison of the alternatives, which, in turn, leads to better decision risk management.","","","Oak Ridge National Lab.

In most parts of these transmission lines the electrons are constrained by the self-magnetic field to flow parallel to the conductors. In very low impedance systems, such as those used to drive Z-pinch radiation sources, the currents from multiple transmission lines are added together. This addition necessarily involves magnetic nulls that connect the positive and negative electrodes. The resultant local loss of magnetic insulation results in electron losses at the anode in the vicinity of the nulls. The lost current due to the magnetic null might or might not be appreciable. In some cases the lost current due to the null is not large, but is spatially localized, and may create a gas and plasma release from the anode that can lead to an excessive loss, and possibly to catastrophic damage to the hardware. In this paper we describe an analytic model that uses one geometric parameter (aside from straightforward hardware size measurements) that determines the loss to the anode, and the extent of the loss region when the driving source and load are known. The parameter can be calculated in terms of the magnetic field in the region of the null calculated when no electron flow is present. The model is compared to some experimental data, and to simulations of several different hardware geometries, including some cases with multiple nulls, and unbalanced feeds.","","","Sandia National Laboratories (SNL), Albuquerque, NM, and Livermore, CA (United States)","USDOE","","United States","2004-08-01T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: Proposed for publication in Physics of Plasmas.","","Medium: X; Size: 31 p.","","SAND2004-3932J","AC04-94AL85000","TRN: US200921%%146","","","2009-11-23T00:00:00Z","964589","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/964589","","Proposed for publication in Physics of Plasmas.","",""

It has funded the development of tubular solid oxide fuel cell (SOFC) and molten carbonate fuel cell (MCFC) power systems operating at up to 60% efficiency on natural gas. The remarkable environmental performance of these fuel cells makes them likely candidates to help mitigate pollution. DOE is now pursuing more widely applicable solid oxide fuel cells for 2010 and beyond. DOE estimates that a 5 kW solid oxide fuel cell system can reach $400/kW at reasonable manufacturing volumes. SECA - the Solid State Energy Conversion Alliance - was formed by the National Energy Technology Laboratory (NETL) and the Pacific Northwest National Laboratory (PNNL) to accelerate the commercial readiness of planar and other solid oxide fuel cell systems utilizing 3-10 kW size modules by taking advantage of the projected economies of production from a mass customization approach. In addition, if the modular 3-10 kW size units can be ganged or scaled up to larger sizes with no increase in cost, then commercial, microgrid and other distributed generation markets will become attainable. Further scale-up and hybridization of SECA SOFCs with gas turbines could result in penetration of the bulk power market.

Ratepayers must foot the bill for costly mortgages on large capital assets sized to meet peak demands that occur only a few hours per year. Furthermore, in an effort to keep costs down, the grid is being forced to operate beyond what it was designed to do. For the last few decades, leading-edge industries have been using abundant real-time information, e-business systems and market efficiencies to minimize the need for inventory and infrastructure and to maximize productivity and efficiency. However, the power grid has been slow to embrace the transforming potential of information technology to gain these benefits.

The electromagnetic environment on the territory of the 500-kV outdoor switchgear is shown to be determined by narrow-band radiations (harmonics of the frequency of electric supply) and wide-band radiations due to corona discharges of high-voltage sources. This means that the personnel experience the action of a commercial-frequency electric field and electromagnetic radiation of a quite wide range, which is not allowed for by the existing guidelines. It is recommended to continue the study in cooperation with medical institutions in order to create guidelines that would allow for the joint action of commercial-frequency electric field and electromagnetic radiation and for the voltage in the line, the current load, the meteorological situation, and other factors.","","","","","","United States","2004-01-15T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: Power Technology and Engineering (Print); Journal Volume: 38; Journal Issue: 1; Other Information: DOI: 10.1023/B:HYCO.0000029636.31951.91; Copyright (c) 2004 Plenum Publishing Corporation; Country of input: International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA)","","Medium: X; Size: page(s) 57-60","","","","Journal ID: ISSN 1570-145X; TRN: US07L3252085948","10.1023/B:HYCO.0000029636.31951.91","","2010-06-03T00:00:00Z","21072581","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/21072581","","Power Technology and Engineering (Print)","1","38"

Several questions arise when fuel cells are discussed: - What are fuel cells? - What is the current status of fuel cells? - What fuel cell designs are being pursued by various organizations worldwide? - What are the advantages and disadvantages of the various fuel cell designs? - What size power systems have been produced and how well have they operated? Fuel cells are electrochemical energy conversion devices that directly convert chemical energy of a fuel to electricity, without combustion of the fuel. In this sense, they are similar to batteries. However, unlike a battery, where life is limited by the amount of chemical that is stored in it, fuel cells produce electricity as long as fuel is supplied. Thus, one might say that fuel cells are continuous batteries. Like batteries, there are many types of fuel cells: - Polymer electrolyte fuel cells are the most commonly discussed in the general interest media--newspapers, magazines and television. These fuel cells operate at {approx}90 degrees C and are the primary candidates for use in automobiles. - Alkaline fuel cells have been used in our space program since the early days of the Gemini and Apollo missions. - Phosphoric acid fuel cells are currently the most advanced on the market and are being commercialized by a division of United Technologies. - Solid oxide fuel cells (SOFCs) are based on zirconia electrolyte.

The combination of instrumentation used in this system allows high precision flux measurements without requiring on-site infrastructure such as prepositioned towers or line power. In addition, the system contains sensors to measure a suit of soil, climatic, and energy-related parameters that are needed to quality control the fluxes and to characterize the flux footprint. The physical design and instrument packaging used in the system allows for simple transport (fits in a standard minivan) and for rapid deployment with a minimal number of field personnel (usually less than a day for one person). The power requirement for the entire system (instruments and data loggers) is less than 35 W, which is provided by a companion solar power system. Side-by-side field comparisons between this system and two permanent AmeriFlux sites and between the roving AmeriFlux intercomparison system are described here. Results of these comparisons indicate that the portable system is capable of absolute flux resolutions of about {+-}1.2 {micro}mol m{sup -2} s{sup -1} for CO{sub 2}, {+-}15 W m{sup -2} for LE, {+-}7 W m{sup -2} for H, and {+-}0.06 m s{sup -1} for u* between any given 30-min averaging periods. It is also found that, compared to a permanent Ameriflux site, the relative accuracy of this flux estimates is between 1 percent and 7 percent. Based on these results, it is concluded that this portable system is capable of making ecosystem flux measurements with an accuracy and precision comparable to most permanent AmeriFlux systems.","","","Ernest Orlando Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory, Berkeley, CA (US) (US)","USDOE.

If implemented in large enough numbers, it may be feasible to leverage DER to provide ancillary services such as Spinning Reserve, System Inertia, or System Stabilization. In an attempt to determine the potential impacts of DER on transmission grid stability, dynamic models of DER/load combinations were created, reduced in order, and scattered throughout Central and Southern California within an existing WSCC dynamic model. Evaluation of the composite WSCC/DER dynamic model allows correlations to be drawn between various DER properties and the transmission grid stability. Key findings show that increasing DER inertia tends to destabilize the transmission system. The cause of this counter-intuitive relationship requires further study, but is likely related to the high impedance separating the DER from the transmission grid.","","","Pacific Northwest National Lab.

As a first phase of this project, a methanol steam reformer system was developed and demonstrated. The reformer system included a combustor, two vaporizers, and a steam-reforming reactor. The device was demonstrated as a thermally independent unit over the range of 14 to 80 Wt output. Assuming a 14-day mission life and an ultimate 1-kg fuel processor/fuel cell assembly, a base case was chosen to illustrate the expected system performance. Operating at 13 We, the system yielded a fuel processor efficiency of 45% (LHV of H2 out/LHV of fuel in) and an estimated net efficiency of 22% (assuming a fuel cell efficiency of 48%). The resulting energy density of 720 W-hr/kg is several times the energy density of the best lithium-ion batteries. Some immediate areas of improvement in thermal management also have been identified and an integrated fuel processor is under development. The final system will be a hybrid, containing a fuel reformer, fuel cell, and rechargeable battery.

It is comprised of three UTC-PDs periodically arranged along a coplanar waveguide transmission line. The photoresponse of the P-TW-UTC-PD is three times that of a single UTC-PD. A 3 dB bandwidth (f{sub 3dB}) of 115 GHz at 1.55 {mu}m was observed in a P-TW-UTC-PD with a terminal resistor located at the input end. This value of f{sub 3dB} is almost the same as that observed in a single UTC-PD. In P-TW-UTC-PDs with no terminal resistor, the 3 dB bandwidth degrades to 56 GHz as a result of the reflection of backward-propagating microwaves at the input end.

From the measurements, the ferromagnetic resonance properties of the magnetic wires have been extracted at frequencies ranging from 100 MHz to 40 GHz for various angles between the wire axis and an external static magnetic field up to 8 kOe. We report on extensive data obtained on the ferromagnetic resonance properties in arrays of nanowires of Ni, NiFe, and NiFeCo alloys with various diameters and packing densities. In such arrays, apart from the shape anisotropy, a strong dipolar coupling between wires is present which can be modulated by the wire density. Both ferromagnetic resonance spectra and hysteresis loops show that this coupling acts as an additional uniaxial anisotropy favoring an easy axis perpendicular to the wires. In particular, it is shown that the easy axis of magnetization can be tuned parallel or perpendicular to the wire axis by changing the wire packing density. Furthermore, ferromagnetic resonance occurs even at zero field and the resonance frequency is fixed by the saturation magnetization of the material independent of the packing density. {copyright} 2001 American Institute of Physics.","The American Physical Society","","","(US)","","United States","2001-06-01T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: Journal of Applied Physics; Journal Volume: 89; Journal Issue: 11; Other Information: DOI: 10.1063/1.1362638; Othernumber: JAPIAU000089000011006704000001; 480111MMM; PBD: 1 Jun 2001","","Medium: X; Size: page(s) 6704-6706","","","","Journal ID: ISSN 0021-8979; TRN: IM200107%%155","10.1063/1.1362638","","2009-12-17T00:00:00Z","40203845","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/40203845","","Journal of Applied Physics","11","89"

The method used in this research was HOMER, the Hybrid Optimization Model for Electric Renewables. HOMER is a computer program that optimizes electrical configurations under user-defined circumstances. According to HOMER, the optimal system for the four regions studied (Kansas, Massachusetts, Oregon, and Arizona) was a hybrid incorporating wind technology. The cost differences between these regions, however, were dependent upon regional renewable resources.

"The superconducting quantum interference device microstrip amplifier: Computer models","Mu''ck, Michael; Clarke, John","24 POWER TRANSMISSION AND DISTRIBUTION; AMPLIFIERS; CAPACITANCE; COMPUTERS; DAMPING; ELECTRODES; FEEDBACK; IMPEDANCE; INDUCTANCE; POWER TRANSMISSION LINES; SQUID DEVICES; WAVELENGTHS","Computer models are presented for a microstrip amplifier based on a dc superconducting quantum interference device (SQUID). In this device, the signal is applied between one end of the spiral input coil and the square washer on which it is deposited. The amplifier exhibits substantial power gain when the signal frequency is such that a half wavelength is approximately equal to the length of the microstrip formed by the coil and the groundplane. The resonant frequency is lowered significantly by the inductance of the square washer transformed into the input coil; this reduction is consistent with predictions of a simple model and with analog simulations. With the washer grounded, the gain of the amplifier peaks at a frequency that is lowered from the unloaded resonant frequency by the damping of the resistance associated with the source. The position and magnitude of the peak are in good agreement with both a lumped circuit model and with a model representing the microstrip as a transmission line. When the counter electrode of the SQUID is grounded and the washer floats, feedback from the output of the SQUID to the input via the capacitance of the microstrip plays a major role and is well described by simulations using the transmission line model. Measurements of the input impedance of the microstrip amplifier show that the return loss can be positive or negative, depending on the sign of the feedback and whether the frequency is above or below the resonant frequency. This behavior is in good accord with simulations.","The American Physical Society","","","(US)","","United States","2000-12-01T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: Journal of Applied Physics; Journal Volume: 88; Journal Issue: 11; Other Information: DOI: 10.1063/1.1321026; Othernumber: JAPIAU000088000011006910000001; 065023JAP; PBD: 1 Dec 2000","","Medium: X; Size: page(s) 6910-6918","","","","Journal ID: ISSN 0021-8979; TRN: US0107078","10.1063/1.1321026","","2009-12-17T00:00:00Z","40204966","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/40204966","","Journal of Applied Physics","11","88"

The architecture of the conductors was Y-123/CeO{sub 2}/IBAD YSZ/Inconel 625. A continuous and passivating Cr{sub 2}O{sub 3} layer forms between the YSZ layer and the Inconel substrate. CeO{sub 2} and Y-123 are closely lattice-matched, and misfit strain is accommodated at the YSZ/CeO{sub 2} interface. Localized reactions between the Y-123 film and the CeO{sub 2} buffer layer result in the formation of BaCeO{sub 3}, YCuO{sub 2}, and CuO. The positive volume change that occurs from the interfacial reaction may act as a kinetic barrier that limits the extent of the reaction. Excess copper and yttrium generated by the interfacial reaction appear to diffuse along grain boundaries and intercalate into Y-123 grains as single layers of the Y-247, Y-248, or Y-224 phases. The interfacial reactions do not preclude the attainment of high critical currents (I{sub c}) and current densities (J{sub c}) in these films nor do they affect to any appreciable extent the nucleation and alignment of the Y-123 film.

And those power levels are the highest in silicon power devices and are comparable to those of the gate turn-off thyristor (GTO). Compared to the conventional GTO, the ETO has much shorter storage time, voltage controlled turn-off capability, and much larger reverse biased safe operation area (RBSOA). Furthermore, ETO's have a forward-biased safe operation area (FBSOA) that enables it to control the turn-on di/dt similar to an insulated gate bipolar transistor (IGBT). These combined advantages make the ETO based power system simpler in terms of dv/dt snubber, di/dt snubber, over current protection, resulting in significant savings in the system cost.

"Consequence and impact of electric utility industry restructuring on transient stability and small-signal stability analysis","Vittal, V","29 ENERGY PLANNING, POLICY AND ECONOMY; 24 POWER TRANSMISSION AND DISTRIBUTION; ELECTRIC UTILITIES; DEREGULATION; POWER SYSTEMS; STABILITY; RELIABILITY; CALCULATION METHODS; ELECTRICAL TRANSIENTS","The electric utility industry is undergoing unprecedented changes in its structure worldwide. With the advent of an open market environment and competition in the industry, and restructuring of the industry into separate generation, transmission, and distribution entities, new issues in power system operation and planning are inevitable. One of the major consequences of this new electric utility environment is the greater emphasis on reliability and secure operation of the power system. This paper examines the impact of restructuring on power system dynamic analysis. It specifically addresses issues related to transient stability analysis and small-signal stability analysis. Four major topics to examine the effect on the nature of studies conducted are considered. These topics are (1) system adequacy and security, (2) system modeling data requirements, (3) system protection and control, and (4) system restoration. The consequences and impact of each of these topics on the nature of the studies conducted are examined and discussed. The emphasis on greater reliability has led to a clearer enunciation of standards, measurements, and guides in some countries. These requirements will result in: (1) more measurements on existing systems, (2) rigorous analysis of transient stability and small-signal stability to determine operating limits and plan systems, (3) greater emphasis on studies to verify coordination and proper performance of protection and controls, and (4) development of a detailed plan for system restoration in the case of wide-spread outages.","","","Iowa State Univ., Ames, IA (US)","","","United States","2000-02-01T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: Proceedings of the IEEE (Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers); Journal Volume: 88; Journal Issue: 2; Other Information: PBD: Feb 2000","","Medium: X; Size: page(s) 196-207","","","","Journal ID: ISSN 0018-9219; IEEPAD; TRN: US0004004","10.1109/5.823998","","2010-06-03T00:00:00Z","20080350","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/20080350","","Proceedings of the IEEE (Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers)","2","88"

Using the irradiance as input signal, the network models the effects of random cloud movement on the electrical variables of the Maximum Power Point Tracker (MPPT) and the variables of the utility-linked inverter over a short period of time. During short time intervals, the irradiance is considered as the only varying input parameter affecting the electrical variables of the system. The advantages of Artificial Neural Network (ANN) simulation over standard linear model is that it does not require the knowledge of internal system parameters, involves less computational effort, and offers a compact solution for multiple-variable problems. The model can be easily integrated into a typical utility system and resulting system behavior can be determined. The viability of the battery-supported PV system as dispatchable unit is also investigated. The simulated results are compared with the experimental results captured during cloudy days. This model can be a useful tool in solar Energy Engineering design and in PV-integrated utility operation.","","","Univ. of Massachusetts, Lowell, MA (US)","","","United States","1999-12-01T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: IEEE Transactions on Energy Conversion (Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers); Journal Volume: 14; Journal Issue: 4; Other Information: PBD: Dec 1999","","Medium: X; Size: page(s) 1572-1577","","","","Journal ID: ISSN 0018-9383; ITCNE4; TRN: IM200032%%144","10.1109/60.815107","","2010-06-03T00:00:00Z","20080379","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/20080379","","IEEE Transactions on Energy Conversion (Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers)","4","14"

Considerable progress has been made on developing light ion beams as a means of transporting this power to inertial fusion capsules. However, further progress is hampered by the lack of an adequate ion source. Alternatively, z-pinches can efficiently convert pulsed power into thermal radiation, which can be used to drive an inertial fusion capsule. However, a z-pinch driven fusion explosion will destroy a portion of the transmission line that delivers the electrical power to the z-pinch. They investigate several options for providing standoff for z-pinch driven fusion.

These models must work satisfactorily with different wind turbine designed so that risks to manufacturers, intending to adopt a particular type of turbine, are minimized. This paper presents a simple model for identifying critical busbars, where the levels of flicker may be high. It also describes a more complex model for accurately predicting flicker induced by operating wind turbines. The models are very flexible and were developed specifically to be coupled to an existing dynamic model of an entire wind turbine. The various models representing static and dynamic loads are described and their impact on flicker are investigated. In addition, the effects of the X/R ratio and fault level of the network are discussed. Various wind conditions and different network parameters have been simulated.

However, if the real and reactive powers of the load and PV system are closely matched, islanding detection by passive methods become difficult. Also most active methods lose effectiveness when there are several PV systems feeding the same island. The active frequency drift method (AFD), also called the frequency bias method, enables islanding detection by forcing the frequency of the voltage in the island to drift up or down. In this paper, AFD is studied analytically, using the describing function analysis technique, and by simulation, using MATLAB. It is shown that AFD has a nondetection zone (NDZ) in which it fails to detect islanding, and that his NDZ includes a range of unity-power-factor loads. Finally, the paper describes a novel method using positive feedback which significantly shrinks the size of the AFD NDZ.","","","Georgia Inst. of Tech., Atlanta, GA (US)","","","United States","1999-09-01T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: IEEE Transactions on Energy Conversion (Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers); Journal Volume: 14; Journal Issue: 3; Other Information: PBD: Sep 1999","","Medium: X; Size: page 810-816","","","","Journal ID: ISSN 0018-9383; ITCNE4","10.1109/60.790956","","2010-06-03T00:00:00Z","20001194","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/20001194","","IEEE Transactions on Energy Conversion (Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers)","3","14"

This study was performed with practical emphasis to examine the impact of cooling loop orientation and operation in the transformer lower plenum upon the electrification phenomenon. A simplified 1/4-scale shell-form transformer insulation structure was designed and fabricated for testing in an appropriately scaled tank complete with six individual cooling loops. Discrete electrodes along the oil flow path facilitated mapping of the internal streaming current distributions as a function of various operating conditions. The streaming current magnitudes and spatial distributions were found to vary with pump configuration, temperature and moisture. Furthermore, certain pumping arrangements which provided interfering transverse flows were shown to reduce local streaming electrification.","","","","","","United States","1999-07-01T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: IEEE Transactions on Power Delivery; Journal Volume: 14; Journal Issue: 3; Other Information: PBD: Jul 1999","","Medium: X; Size: pp. 978-985","","","","Journal ID: ITPDE5; ISSN 0885-8977; TRN: IM9939%%81","10.1109/61.772343","","2009-12-16T00:00:00Z","678025","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/678025","","IEEE Transactions on Power Delivery","3","14"
"Modeling and simulation, and their validation of three-phase transformers with three legs under DC bias","Fuchs, E F; You, Y; Roesler, D J","24 POWER TRANSMISSION AND DISTRIBUTION; TRANSFORMERS; MATHEMATICAL MODELS; COMPUTERIZED SIMULATION; ELECTRIC POTENTIAL","This paper proposes a new model for three-phase transformers with three legs with and without tank under DC bias based on electric and magnetic circuit theory. For the calculation of the nonsinusoidal no-load currents, a combination of time and frequency domains is used. The analysis shows that (1) asymmetric three-phase transformers with three legs generate magnetizing currents with triplen harmonics not being of the zero-sequence type. (2) The wave shapes of the three magnetizing currents of (asymmetric) transformers are dependent on the phase sequence. (3) The magnetic history of transformer magnetization -- due to residual magnetization and hysteresis of the tank -- cannot be ignored if a DC bias is present and the magnetic influence of the tank is relatively strong, e.g., for oil-cooled transformers. (4) Symmetric three-phase transformers with three legs generate no-load currents without triplen harmonics. (5) The effects of DC bias currents (e.g., reactive power demand, harmonic distortion) can be suppressed employing symmetric three-phase transformers with three legs including tank. Measurements corroborate computational results; thus this nonlinear model is valid and accurate.","","","","USDOE, Washington, DC (United States)","","United States","1999-04-01T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: IEEE Transactions on Power Delivery; Journal Volume: 14; Journal Issue: 2; Other Information: PBD: Apr 1999","","Medium: X; Size: pp. 443-449","","","","Journal ID: ITPDE5; ISSN 0885-8977; TRN: IM9928%%75","10.1109/61.754087","","2009-12-16T00:00:00Z","352481","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/352481","","IEEE Transactions on Power Delivery","2","14"

This paper presents the use of chaotic dynamics to describe the operation of nonlinear loads. Included is a discussion of the Lyapunov exponents, a measure of chaotic behavior. The alternate approach is applied to electric arc furnaces. A tuning mode is described to develop the parameters of a chaotic model.

"Development and calibration of a network-based streaming electrification model for core-form transformer structures","Brubaker, M A; Nelson, J K","24 POWER TRANSMISSION AND DISTRIBUTION; TRANSFORMERS; INSULATING OILS; ELECTRIC CHARGES; ELECTROSTATICS; MATHEMATICAL MODELS; ELECTRIC POTENTIAL","Streaming electrification occurs in large power transformers when oil circulated for cooling purposes acts to separate charges from the Debye layer on the cellulose insulation surfaces. This phenomenon is believed to have caused several catastrophic transformer failures and remains to be satisfactorily understood in realistic geometries. A network-based streaming electrification model is presented which utilizes single winding ducts as the basic element to investigate a core-form structure. The network is first analyzed using hydraulic duct parameters to calculate the oil flow distributions within the structure. This data is then provided to the electrification solver which predicts the charge densities at each duct outlet. The charge density results are ultimately used to determine the streaming potentials at each node based on a suitable matrix of leakage resistances. Development of the network model is presented along with empirically-based calibration data for a realistic section of core-form transformer geometry.","","","","USDOE, Washington, DC (United States)","","United States","1999-04-01T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: IEEE Transactions on Power Delivery; Journal Volume: 14; Journal Issue: 2; Other Information: PBD: Apr 1999","","Medium: X; Size: pp. 431-436","","","","Journal ID: ITPDE5; ISSN 0885-8977; TRN: IM9928%%74","10.1109/61.754085","","2009-12-16T00:00:00Z","352480","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/352480","","IEEE Transactions on Power Delivery","2","14"

A future application of such a device is as an uninterruptible power supply for critical loads on a distribution feeder. However, the same power electronics and flywheel system could also be used for dynamic voltage compensation. A comparison is made between series and parallel connection of such dynamic compensation techniques used to maintain rated load voltage on distribution feeders when there are momentary dips in the supply voltage. For each case a mathematical model is presented and analyzed.

"Leveling reliability in systems with large hydro resources","Gonzalez, C; Juan, J","13 HYDRO ENERGY; 24 POWER TRANSMISSION AND DISTRIBUTION; LOAD MANAGEMENT; INTERCONNECTED POWER SYSTEMS; HYDROELECTRIC POWER PLANTS; RELIABILITY; DECISION MAKING; PLANNING","Reliability analysis of a generating system is established in terms of the reliability characteristics of the different units in the system and in terms of the demand of energy to be satisfied. When the analysis is performed for the long-term (one year or more duration periods), the maintenance needs of thermal units as well as the time distribution of resources for units with energy restrictions, must also be taken into account. This paper describes a method for determining the optimal strategy for allocating the yearly energy resulting from random water inflows to the different subperiods of a year so that the reliability for all the subperiods is leveled. A characteristic feature of the method is that the uncertainty inherent in forecasting future available hydroenergy is transferred to the reliability index. The procedure is illustrated by an example prepared using the Spanish generating system.","","","","","","United States","1999-02-01T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: IEEE Transactions on Power Systems; Journal Volume: 14; Journal Issue: 1; Other Information: PBD: Feb 1999","","Medium: X; Size: pp. 23-28","","","","Journal ID: ITPSEG; ISSN 0885-8950; TRN: IM9915%%22","10.1109/59.744479","","2009-12-16T00:00:00Z","330506","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/330506","","IEEE Transactions on Power Systems","1","14"
"Scheduling hydro power systems with restricted operating zones and discharge ramping constraints","Guan, X; Svoboda, Al; Li, C","13 HYDRO ENERGY; 24 POWER TRANSMISSION AND DISTRIBUTION; POWER SYSTEMS; HYDROELECTRIC POWER PLANTS; PLANNING; POWER GENERATION","An optimization-based algorithm is presented for scheduling hydro power systems with restricted operating zones and discharge ramping constraints. Hydro watershed scheduling problems are difficult to solve because many constraints, continuous and discrete, including hydraulic coupling of cascaded reservoirs have to be considered. Restricted or forbidden operating zones as well as minimum generation limits of hydro units result in discontinuous preferred operating regions, and hinder direct applications of efficient continuous optimization methods such as network flow algorithms. Discharge ramping constraints due to navigational, environmental and recreational requirements in a hydro system add another dimension of difficulty since they couple generation or water discharge across time horizon. The key idea of this paper is to use additional sets of multipliers to relax discontinuous operating region and discharge ramping constraints on individual hydro units so that a two-level optimization structure is formed. The low level consists of a continuous discharge scheduling subproblem determining the generation levels of all units in the entire watershed, and a number of pure integer scheduling subproblems determining the hydro operating states, one for each unit. The discharge subproblem is solved by a network flow algorithm, and the integer scheduling problems are solved by dynamic programming with a small number of states and well-structured transitions. The two sets of subproblems are coordinated through multipliers updated at the high level by using a modified subgradient algorithm. After the dual problem converges, a feasible hydro schedule is obtained by using the same network flow algorithm with the operating states obtained, and operating ranges modified to guarantee satisfaction of ramping constraints.","","","","USDOE","","United States","1999-02-01T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: IEEE Transactions on Power Systems; Journal Volume: 14; Journal Issue: 1; Other Information: PBD: Feb 1999","","Medium: X; Size: pp. 126-131","","","","Journal ID: ITPSEG; ISSN 0885-8950; TRN: IM9915%%25","10.1109/59.744500","","2016-05-19T00:00:00Z","330509","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/330509","","IEEE Transactions on Power Systems","1","14"
"Making Prony analysis more accurate using multiple signals","Trudnowski, D J; Johnson, J M; Hauer, J F","24 POWER TRANSMISSION AND DISTRIBUTION; PRONY METHOD; POWER SYSTEMS; STABILITY; OSCILLATIONS; ELECTRICAL TRANSIENTS","Prony analysis has proven to be a valuable tool in estimating the modal content of power oscillations from measured ringdowns. The accuracy of the mode estimates is limited by the noise content always found in field measured signals. Current Prony analysis methods assume the system to be single output, and individual signals are analyzed independently often resulting in conflicting frequency and damping estimates (due to noise effects). This paper considers a simple extension to Prony analysis that allows multiple signals to be analyzed simultaneously resulting in one set of mode estimates. Examples are used to show that this extension improves the accuracy of modal estimates and simplifies the analysis steps. The first example uses a Monte Carlo type simulation model and the second analyzes field measured data from the western North American power system.","","","","","","United States","1999-02-01T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: IEEE Transactions on Power Systems; Journal Volume: 14; Journal Issue: 1; Other Information: PBD: Feb 1999","","Medium: X; Size: pp. 226-231","","","","Journal ID: ITPSEG; ISSN 0885-8950; TRN: IM9915%%26","10.1109/59.744537","","2009-12-16T00:00:00Z","330510","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/330510","","IEEE Transactions on Power Systems","1","14"

The ceramic materials for these filters include monolithics (usually non-oxides), oxide and non-oxide fiber-reinforced composites, and recrystallized silicon carbide. A concern of end users in using these types of filters, where over 3000 may be used in a single installation, is the lack of a data base on which to base decisions for reusing, replacing or predicting remaining life during plant shutdowns. One method to improve confidence of usage is to develop nondestructive evaluation (NDE) technology to provide surveillance methods for determination of the extent of damage or of life-limiting characteristics such as thermal fatigue, oxidation, damage from ash bridging such as localized cracking, damage from local burning, and elongation at elevated temperatures. Although in situ NDE methods would be desirable in order to avoid disassembly of the candle filter vessels, the possible presence of filter cakes and/or ash bridging, and the state of current NDE technology prevent this. Thus, off-line NDE methods, if demonstrated to be reliable, fast and cost effective, could be a significant step forward in developing confidence in utilization of rigid ceramic hot gas filters. Recently, NDE methods have been developed which show promise of providing information to build this confidence. Acousto-ultrasound, a totally nondestructive method, together with advanced digital signal processing, has been demonstrated to provide excellent correlation with remaining strength on new, as-produced filters, and for detecting damage in some monolithic filters when removed from service. Thermal imaging, with digital signal processing for determining through-wall thermal diffusivity, has also been demonstrated to correlate with remaining strength in both new (as-received) and in-service filters. Impact acoustic resonance using a scanning laser vibrometer has been demonstrated to allow detection of changes in frequency which may be correlated to remaining strength. These methods have been shown to be applicable to clay-bonded SiC filters, recrystallized SiC filters, CVI-SiC composite filters and oxide composite filters. Other NDE methods under development include: (a) fast, high spatial-resolution X-ray imaging for detecting density variations and dimensional changes; (b) air-coupled ultrasonic methods for determining through-thickness compositional variations; and (c) acoustic emission technology with mechanical loading for detecting localized bulk damage.","","","Argonne National Lab.

The transmitter assembly used a high-power-density array of infrared laser diode bars, water cooled via integrated microchannel heat sinks and focused by cylindrical microlenses. The diode array composite beam was refocused by a parabolic mirror over a 10 meter path, and received on a {approximately}15{times}25&hthinsp;cm panel of thin film high efficiency silicon solar cells. The maximum cell output obtained was several watts, and the cell output was used to drive a small motor. Due to operating constraints and unexpected effects, particularly the high nonuniformity of the output beam, both the distance and total received power in this demonstration were modest. However, the existing transmitter is capable of supplying several hundred watts of light output, with a projected received electric power in excess of 200 watts. The source radiance is approximately 5{times}10{sup 9}&hthinsp;W/m{sup 2}-steradian. With the existing 20 cm aperture, useful power transmission over ranges to {approximately}100 meters should be achievable with a DC to DC efficiency of greater than 10{percent}. Non-coherent sources of this type are readily scalable to powers of tens of kilowatts, and with larger apertures can be used directly for power transmission up to several kilometers. Future non-coherent diode laser sources may be suitable for power transmission over hundreds of kilometers. Also, the experience gained with non-coherent arrays will be directly applicable to power beaming systems using coherent diode arrays or other array-type laser sources. {copyright} {ital 1999 American Institute of Physics.}","","","Lawrence Livermore National Lab.

Energy deposited in anode surfaces may exceed anode plasma thermal-desorption creation thresholds on the time-scale of the pulse. Stimulated resorption by electron or photon bombardment can also lead to plasma formation on electrode or insulator surfaces. Device performance is limited above these thresholds, particularly impulse length and energy, by the formation and expansion of neutral and plasma layers formed, primarily from electrode contaminants. In-situ conditioning tech&ques to modify and eliminate the contaminants through multiple high-voltage pukes, low base pressures, RF discharge cleaning, heating, surface coatings, and ion- and electron-beam surface treatment allow access to new regimes of performance through control of plasma formation and modification of the plasma properties.

This paper presents an efficient technique which allows a single simulation to study probabilistically the impact of DSM on loss-of-load probability, energy not served and energy consumption in probabilistic production costing methodology. It also provides an analytical method to study the impact of DSM on capacity requirements. Another advantage of this technique is that the DSM administrative costs can directly be incorporated while simulating the DSM resources. The proposed technique does not alter the original load shape but basically models DSM resources as generating units in the system.

One alternative to address these problems is the use of six-phase transmission lines. Six-phase transmission lines can provide the same power capacity with a lower phase to phase voltage and smaller, more compact towers as compared to a standard double circuit three-phase line. The geometry of the six-phase compact towers may also aid in the reduction of magnetic fields. This study compares the installation costs of constructing a standard 115 kV double circuit three-phase transmission line to constructing a 66 kV six-phase transmission line to illustrate that the use of six-phase transmission can be a cost effective solution to address some of these problems. Both standard and constrained Rights-of-Way (ROW) are considered. Also the effect of incorporating losses in the evaluation is investigated.","","","","","","United States","1998-10-01T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: IEEE Transactions on Power Delivery; Journal Volume: 13; Journal Issue: 4; Other Information: PBD: Oct 1998","","Medium: X; Size: pp. 1521-1526","","","","Journal ID: ITPDE5; ISSN 0885-8977; TRN: IM9920%%11","10.1109/61.714849","","2009-12-16T00:00:00Z","346794","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/346794","","IEEE Transactions on Power Delivery","4","13"

"Instantaneous phasor method for obtaining instantaneous balanced fundamental components for power quality control and continuous diagnostics","Hsu, J S","24 POWER TRANSMISSION AND DISTRIBUTION; ELECTRIC POWER; QUALITY CONTROL; POWER LOSSES; HARMONICS; SURGES","Poor power quality not only causes additional energy losses, it may also cause detrimental interruptions to business and manufacturing operations. The growing popularity of electronic equipment, such as computers, televisions, electronic ballasts, solid-state motor controllers, and electronically controlled industry loads pollutes the power quality. In 1995, EPRI reported that the revenue losses due to poor power quality to US business alone were $400 billion per year. A new instantaneous phasor method for obtaining instantaneous balanced fundamental components is introduced. An example is presented. This technique may be used for active power quality control and for continuous diagnostics.","","","","","","United States","1998-10-01T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: IEEE Transactions on Power Delivery; Journal Volume: 13; Journal Issue: 4; Other Information: PBD: Oct 1998","","Medium: X; Size: pp. 1494-1500","","","","Journal ID: ITPDE5; ISSN 0885-8977; TRN: IM9920%%10","10.1109/61.714826","","2009-12-16T00:00:00Z","346793","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/346793","","IEEE Transactions on Power Delivery","4","13"

Unfortunately, the local magnetic properties in the actual core were still not understood fully. The study of soft magnetic materials commonly used in rotating machines and three-phase transformers is very important for saving energy. This paper deals with analysis by FEM for iron losses considering vector magnetic properties. The authors define the tensor magnetic reluctivity and calculate it from the data measured with two-dimensional measurement method. This numerical method is applied to the direct magnetic loss analysis. As a result, it is shown that the calculated results using the method are in a good agreement with measured ones.","","","","","","United States","1998-09-01T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: IEEE Transactions on Magnetics; Journal Volume: 34; Journal Issue: 5Pt1; Conference: COMPUMAG `97: 11. conference on the computation of electromagnetic fields, Rio de Janeiro (Brazil), 3-6 Nov 1997; Other Information: PBD: Sep 1998","","Medium: X; Size: pp. 3008-3011","","CONF-971159-","","Journal ID: IEMGAQ; ISSN 0018-9464; TRN: IM9830%%125","10.1109/20.717703","","2009-12-16T00:00:00Z","665278","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/665278","","IEEE Transactions on Magnetics","5Pt1","34"

The conclusion of their paper, that fewer than 30 competitive firms (or, equivalently, an HHI over 333) likely constitute an impermissibly concentrated market, is a startling one, since it is unlikely that any deregulated electricity market will have this many competitors. In examining the source of the RDR conclusion in some detail and seeing where it goes awry, the author thinks it is possible to glean principles that can guide regulators to draw more sensible conclusions about the number of competitors required in these markets.","","","","","","United States","1998-07-01T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: Electricity Journal; Journal Volume: 11; Journal Issue: 6; Other Information: PBD: Jul 1998","","Medium: X; Size: pp. 44-50","","","","Journal ID: ELEJE4; ISSN 1040-6190; TRN: IM9834%%281","10.1016/S1040-6190(98)00060-8","","2009-12-16T00:00:00Z","290002","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/290002","","Electricity Journal","6","11"

The PWM wave was composed of a 50Hz fundamental wave, a 16kHz carrier frequency wave and some other higher harmonics. It was found that the power losses of the inductor cores were much larger than those of the transformer cores when the cores were driven by a PWM inverter, although such a great difference was not observed under sinusoidal voltage excitation. Power losses of the inductor made of 6.5% silicon steel sheets and conventional grain oriented 3% silicon steel sheets under PWM voltage excitation were also investigated. It was found that the power losses of the inductor made of 6.5% silicon steel sheets were reduced by more than 30% compared to those of the inductor made of grain oriented 3% silicon steel sheets. This was because the grain oriented 3% silicon steel sheets had higher losses at higher harmonics found in the PWM excitation. Therefore, it was clearly shown that 6.5% silicon steel sheet was a suitable material for the inductor under PWM voltage excitation.","","","","","","United States","1998-07-01T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: IEEE Transactions on Magnetics; Journal Volume: 34; Journal Issue: 4Pt1; Conference: 7. joint MMM-intermag conference, San Francisco, CA (United States), 6-9 Jan 1998; Other Information: PBD: Jul 1998","","Medium: X; Size: pp. 1183-1185","","CONF-980102-","","Journal ID: IEMGAQ; ISSN 0018-9464; TRN: IM9825%%131","10.1109/20.706469","","2009-12-16T00:00:00Z","649518","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/649518","","IEEE Transactions on Magnetics","4Pt1","34"

It offers major potential advantages for the static and dynamic operation of transmission lines, but it brings with it major design challenges, both in the power electronics and from the perspective of the power system. As the UPFC transitions from concept to full-scale power system implementation, the control and protection of this sophisticated equipment are of primary concern. This paper describes the basic control, sequencing and protection philosophies that govern the operation of the UPFC, subject to the practical constraints encountered in an actual high power installation.

The method uses a statistical model for nonlinear load currents to generate the probabilities of specific harmonic voltage levels. The statistical model for the harmonic currents produced by a concentration of EVs accounts for partial harmonics cancellation introduced by uncertainty and variation in charger start-time and initial battery state-of-charge. A general solution technique is presented along with several examples using data from a commercially-available EV charger and an actual power distribution system. The results show that there is a definite threshold penetration below which EV charging has negligible impact on the number of buses whose voltage total harmonic distortion (THD{sub v}) exceeds 5%. During the late evening of a summer day, the example distribution system can accommodate EV penetration levels as high as 20%. A similar analysis of the system in the spring or fall indicates that the system can accommodate a 15% EV penetration before THD{sub v} exceeds 5% at an unacceptable number of buses.","","","","","","United States","1998-04-01T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: IEEE Transactions on Power Delivery; Journal Volume: 13; Journal Issue: 2; Other Information: PBD: Apr 1998","","Medium: X; Size: pp. 640-646","","","","Journal ID: ITPDE5; ISSN 0885-8977; TRN: IM9920%%14","10.1109/61.660951","","2009-12-16T00:00:00Z","346797","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/346797","","IEEE Transactions on Power Delivery","2","13"

The FCL employs two superconducting coils with differing critical currents wound noninductively. The analysis shows that to reduce the voltage drop under normal operating conditions, the coupling coefficient should be kept fairly high (k&gt;0.90). For a given coil configuration ({omega}{bar L}=constant), the limiting capability of the device increases with the resistance R of the trigger coil up to a certain value of R, then further increase in R changes very little the limiting capability of the FCL. However, further increase in R can reduce the heat generation rate in the device which will help alleviate the problem of relatively long recovery time. The fault current predicted from estimated values of R compares fairly well with results of an experiment reported in the literature. The discrepancy between the predicted and measured current is due mainly to the uncertainty in the estimated resistance R, because both the purity of Cu and the percentage of Cu in CuNi are not known. By varying the ratio of NbTi-Cu-CuNi in the matrix, the purity of Cu, and the percentage of Cu in CuNi various values of R, can be achieved, which should help to alleviate the problem of excessive Joule heating and recovery time.","","","Argonne National Lab.

The lowest cost service was generally provided by very large central power plants, or large hydroelectric facilities. Most of the emerging non-hydro renewable energy technologies used for electricity production today are now less costly than nuclear. However, they still appear to be more costly than the competing fossil fuel resources when evaluated in this central station model. According to conventional utility costs tests they are also less suited to large, central applications, because of their inherently diffuse and local nature. In the 1990s entirely different approaches to evaluating the benefits of renewable energy resources from both the societal and utility perspectives began to emerge, spurred by the widespread adoption of `integrated resource planning` (IRP). Large scale utility applications of wind, solar, geothermal and biomass were also producing important historical cost data, and driving costs down. At the same time the emerging `distributed utility` model began to show the value of dispersed applications of smaller and more localized energy sources, closer and better adapted to their end uses. The results of these analyses now stimulate the acceleration of the commercialization of utility-scale renewables. This article provides a review of the economics of the `sustained orderly development` of renewables, and of `distributed utility` economics from the standpoint of renewable resource applications. The article concludes with policy recommendations of the necessary conditions to revitalize renewable energy resource commercialization, and to assume a permanent and important role in economic development, within the rapidly changing electricity industry. 73 refs., 38 figs., 9 tabs.","","","","","","United States","1997-12-31T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: Advances in Solar Energy; Journal Volume: 11; Other Information: PBD: 1997","","Medium: X; Size: pp. 329-414","","","","Journal ID: ASOED9; ISSN 0731-8618; TRN: 98:000167-0007","","","2009-12-16T00:00:00Z","563443","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/563443","","Advances in Solar Energy","","11"

In some cases thee problems may be so slight as to be non-existent from a practical standpoint and so may be dismissed. Remember, just because modern test equipment such as a harmonic analyzer or power line analyzer (PLA) can detect and report on the harmonic currents and voltages for the circuit being examined, the presence of these conditions does not automatically mean trouble. Other common forms of power quality problems involve wiring system design, load-power source impedance interactions, switched on-off loads, and the unwanted effects of magnetic fields due to current flow in conductors of all types. This article briefly describes the above problems and provides some time-tested methods of dealing with their most common forms.","","","","","","United States","1997-12-31T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: Energy Engineering; Journal Volume: 94; Journal Issue: 5; Other Information: PBD: 1997","","Medium: X; Size: pp. 44-60","","","","Journal ID: EENGDO; ISSN 0199-8595; TRN: IM9803%%198","","","2009-12-16T00:00:00Z","562256","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/562256","","Energy Engineering","5","94"

The rotor has been wound with superconducting wire of Nb-Ti alloy. A closed-circuit liquid helium system has been designed and installed for cooling the superconducting windings. The stator carries the air-gap type armature windings and a laminated-iron flux-shield. A new concept in the design of superconducting generators with high short-circuit ratio (more than 5) has been introduced. This eliminates the requirement of Electro-magnetic Damper (EMD) and Quick Response Excitation System (QRES). The generator has been comprehensively tested in superconducting state. Open-circuit and sustained short-circuit tests, 3-phase sudden short-circuit test, synchronization with grid and parallel operation with power system have been conducted. The synchronous machine was operated up to its rated kVA in the four quadrants--as generator and as condenser with leading and lagging power factors. A few special tests on superconducting generator, which were not reported earlier, such as direct-on-line starting of a 20 HP squirrel-cage induction motor and negative phase sequence tests have also been performed successfully.

Perhaps nothing has influenced the growth of human society as much as the presence of energy technology. Today, ceramics are incorporated at all levels of the energy discipline, including dams, electric insulators, capacitors, refractories and fiberglass for home insulation. Tomorrow, leaders are going to expect new ways of harnessing, using and conserving clean and abundant energy. Superconductors and nuclear containment vessels are two developing areas of new ceramic applications. With new environmental regulations, the time of passing-on accepted methods of fabrication will come to an end. Ceramic engineers of the future will need to better understand the mechanisms of how materials behave.

It is demonstrated that in each of these conductors, critical current densities are dictated by the grain boundary misorientation distributions (GBMD{close_quote}s). Percolative networks of low-angle boundaries with fractions consistent with the active cross-sectional area of the conductor exist in each of these conductors. Further enhancements in the properties require increased numbers of small-angle grain boundaries. Given the processing methods used to fabricate these materials, no clear route employing a simple modification of the established processing method is apparent. To address this need, conductors with controlled or predetermined GBMD{close_quote}s are necessary. Development of biaxial texture appears to be the only possible way to increase the number of small-angle boundaries in a practical and controllable manner. We summarize in this paper recent results obtained on epitaxial superconducting films on rolling-assisted-biaxially-textured-substrates (RABiTS). This technique uses well established, industrially scalable, thermomechanical processes to impart a strong biaxial texture to a base metal. This is followed by vapor deposition of epitaxial buffer layers (metal and/or ceramic) to yield structurally and chemically compatible surfaces. Epitaxial YBa{sub 2}Cu{sub 3}O{sub 7{minus}{delta}} films grown using laser ablation on such substrates have critical current densities exceeding 10{sup 6} A/cm{sup 2} at 77 K in zero field and have a field dependence similar to epitaxial films on single crystal ceramic substrates. Deposited conductors made using this technique offer a potential route for the fabrication of the next generation high temperature superconducting (HTS) wire capable of carrying high currents in high magnetic fields and at elevated temperatures. {copyright} {ital 1997 Materials Research Society.}","","","Oak Ridge National Lab.

Load characteristics can significantly influence the results of synchronous stability and voltage stability studies. This paper presents a methodology for identification of power system load dynamics using neural networks. Input-output data of a power system dynamic load is used to design a neural network model which comprises delayed inputs and feedback connections. The developed neural network model can predict the future power system dynamic load behavior for arbitrary inputs. In particular, a third-order induction motor load neural network model is developed to verify the methodology. Neural network simulation results are illustrated and compared with the induction motor load response.","","","","","","United States","1997-11-01T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: IEEE Transactions on Power Systems; Journal Volume: 12; Journal Issue: 4; Other Information: PBD: Nov 1997","","Medium: X; Size: pp. 1468-1473","","","","Journal ID: ITPSEG; ISSN 0885-8950; TRN: IM9804%%6","10.1109/59.627843","","2009-12-16T00:00:00Z","563873","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/563873","","IEEE Transactions on Power Systems","4","12"

Observations presented in this study demonstrate that many single scenarios are often closely similar when distribution factors on interutility transmission ties are used to guide a scenario reduction technique. This process facilitates a reduction in the total number of scenarios needed to characterize a particular network configuration, while preserving their associated parallel path characteristics. This paper applies the technique to energy transactions and generator siting options using generator shift factors and suggests it can be used as an initial screening method for broad area assessment.","","","Argonne National Lab.

Integration of multiple modules would provide an amount of power that exceeds the power of a single module by combining and directing the coherent beams to the user`s receiver. The model developed for the DSPIL system conservatively predicts the laser output power (50 kW) that appears much less than the laser output (93 kW) obtained from the gain volume ratio extrapolation of experimental data. The difference in laser outputs may be attributed to reflector configurations adopted in both design and experiment. Even though the photon absorption by multiple reflections in experimental cavity setup was more efficient, the maximum secondary absorption amounts to be only 24.7 percent of the primary. However, the gain volume ratio shows 86 percent more power output than theoretical estimation that is roughly 60 percent more than the contribution by the secondary absorption. Such a difference indicates that the theoretical model adopted in the study underestimates the overall performance of the DSPIL. This fact may tolerate more flexible and radical selection of design parameters than used in this design study. The design achieves an overall specific power of approximately 5 W/kg and total mass of 10 metric tons.","","","","","","United States","1997-11-01T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: Journal of Solar Energy Engineering; Journal Volume: 119; Journal Issue: 4; Other Information: PBD: Nov 1997","","Medium: X; Size: pp. 304-311","","","","Journal ID: JSEEDO; ISSN 0199-6231; TRN: IM9811%%80","10.1115/1.2888037","","2016-04-08T00:00:00Z","590139","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/590139","","Journal of Solar Energy Engineering","4","119"

Operating details are taken for granted by the general public; only when some catastrophic failure takes place is power system stability seen as newsworthy. Faults occur on power systems, most often through natural phenomena beyond human control. However, a well designed system will, for the most common faults, recover automatically and continue power delivery with very little inconvenience to its customers. This level of performance is achieved at a high cost in terms of manpower and equipment. In the future, the market economy is likely to force power systems much closer to their limits of stable operation, and operating decisions will have to be based on accurate, online system information and simulations rather than the current practice of extensive offline simulation of a comprehensive set of possible system operating conditions.","","","","","","United States","1997-10-01T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: IEEE Computer Applications in Power; Journal Volume: 10; Journal Issue: 4; Other Information: PBD: Oct 1997","","Medium: X; Size: pp. 50-54","","","","Journal ID: ICAPEH; ISSN 0895-0156; TRN: IM9804%%53","10.1109/67.625375","","2009-12-16T00:00:00Z","563917","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/563917","","IEEE Computer Applications in Power","4","10"

Early pipeline construction consisted of bare steel or cast iron pipe, which was very well grounded. Bell and spigot, mechanical, or dresser-style joint couplings often were used, creating electrically discontinuous pipelines which are less susceptible to AC induction. Although induced AC affects any pipeline parallel to a high-voltage alternating current (HVAC) power line, the effects were not noticeable on bare pipelines. With the advent of welded steel pipelines, modern cathodic protection (CP) methods and materials, and the vastly improved quality of protective coatings, induced AC effects on pipelines have become a significant consideration on many pipeline rights-of-way. In the last two to three decades, one has been seeing much more joint occupancy of the same right-of-way by one or more pipelines and power lines. As the cost of right-of-way and the difficulty in acquisition, particularly in urban areas, have risen, the concept of joint occupancy rights-of-way has become more attractive to many utility companies. Federal and state regulations usually insist on joint-use right-of-way when a utility proposes crossing regulated or publicly owned lands, wherever there is an existing easement. Such joint use allows the induced AC phenomena to occur and may create electrical hazards and interference to pipeline facilities. Underground pipelines are especially susceptible if they are well-coated and electrically isolated for CP.","","","","","","United States","1997-10-01T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: Pipeline and Gas Journal; Journal Volume: 224; Journal Issue: 10; Other Information: PBD: Oct 1997","","Medium: X; Size: pp. 67-69","","","","Journal ID: PLGJAT; ISSN 0032-0188; TRN: 97:020379","","","2009-12-16T00:00:00Z","543543","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/543543","","Pipeline and Gas Journal","10","224"

Since the SFC uses 6-pulse rectifier technique, a large amount of harmonic currents are produced during the starting period. The harmonic distortion level at each bus of the power plant was very high. Especially, the total harmonic distortion (THD) of current at the lighting feeder reached up to 184%, so that power fuses were burned out. At first a 5 mH reactor was inserted in the SFC feeder and a 5th order and high pass filter was installed. However, the harmonic distortion levels were still too high, but there is no space for additional higher-order filters. Finally, the SFC is fed with an individual transformer, and the harmonic disturbance problem is avoided.

This paper presents a new expression of the vector magnetic properties under alternating and rotating flux conditions. The expression is defined by an improved reluctivity tensor based on measured results. Moreover, the expression is more accurate than conventional expressions about the approximation of magnetic properties in arbitrary direction. Accordingly, the new expression is introduced into a finite element formulation, and applied to a simple anisotropic magnetic field problem.

"An approach to harmonic current-free ac/dc power conversion for large industrial loads: The integration of a series active filter with a double-series diode rectifier","Fujita, Hideaki; Akagi, Hirofumi","24 POWER TRANSMISSION AND DISTRIBUTION; RECTIFIERS; ELECTRIC FILTERS; SEMICONDUCTOR DIODES; HARMONICS; DAMPING; ATTENUATION","This paper proposes a new harmonic current-free ac/dc power conversion system characterized by the integration of a small-rated series active filter with a large-rated double-series diode rectifier. The dc terminals of the active filter are directly connected in parallel with those of the diode rectifier, thereby forming a common dc bus. The active filter enables the diode rectifier to draw three-phase sinusoidal currents from the utility. In addition, it can provide the supplementary value-added function of regulating the common dc-bus voltage to a limited extent of {+-}5%, slightly increasing the rms voltage rating, but not increasing the peak voltage rating. Experimental results obtained from a 5-kW laboratory system verify the practical viability and cost effectiveness of the proposed system.","","","","","","United States","1997-09-01T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: IEEE Transactions on Industry Applications; Journal Volume: 33; Journal Issue: 5; Other Information: DN: Presented at the 1996 Industry Applications Society annual meeting, October 6--10, San Diego, CA (US); PBD: Sep-Oct 1997","","Medium: X; Size: pp. 1233-1240","","","","Journal ID: ITIACR; ISSN 0093-9994; TRN: IM9804%%49","10.1109/28.633801","","2009-12-16T00:00:00Z","563913","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/563913","","IEEE Transactions on Industry Applications","5","33"

Forecasts are needed for a variety of utility activities such as generation scheduling, scheduling of fuel purchases, maintenance scheduling and security analysis. Depending on power system characteristics, significant forecasting errors can lead to either excessively conservative scheduling or very marginal scheduling. Either can induce heavy economic penalties. This paper examines the economic impact of inaccurate load forecasts. Monte Carlo simulations were used to study the effect of different load forecasting accuracy. Investigations into the effect of improving the daily peak load forecasts, effect of different seasons of the year and effect of utilization factors are presented.","","","","","","United States","1997-08-01T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: IEEE Transactions on Power Systems; Journal Volume: 12; Journal Issue: 3; Other Information: PBD: Aug 1997","","Medium: X; Size: pp. 1388-1392","","","","Journal ID: ITPSEG; ISSN 0885-8950; TRN: 97:018566","10.1109/59.630486","","2009-12-16T00:00:00Z","538101","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/538101","","IEEE Transactions on Power Systems","3","12"

The Slovenian ecological monitoring system was set up fifteen years ago with the task of assuring acquisition of data about air pollution in the vicinity of thermal power plants. In the meantime it has been constantly upgraded and improved. At the end of 1994 immission, emission and meteorological data started to be on-line transmitted to the National Dispatching Centre. Problems with space and restrictions encountered at the construction of new transmission lines made researchers look for solutions that would allow a greater loading of transmission lines without threatening the system reliability. A method was consequently theoretically implemented about the monitoring of the thermal loading of the most important 400 kV transmission lines supported with meteorological data obtained from the EIS measuring system. Transmission of data from EIS into the Dispatching Centre, supported with an adequate software, will facilitate efficient control of the system at consideration of ecological limitations (electricity production in thermal power plants) and at the same time a more efficient exploitation of transmission lines in view of meteorological conditions. The main idea of this paper is the use of the same meteorological system for controlling both, thermal power generation and loading of important 400 kV overhead lines.","","","","","","United States","1997-08-01T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: IEEE Transactions on Power Systems; Journal Volume: 12; Journal Issue: 3; Other Information: DN: Paper presented at the 1996 IEEE/PES summer meeting, July 28--August 1, 1996, Denver, CO (US); PBD: Aug 1997","","Medium: X; Size: pp. 1068-1075","","","","Journal ID: ITPSEG; ISSN 0885-8950; TRN: IM9746%%19","10.1109/59.630445","","2009-12-16T00:00:00Z","538094","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/538094","","IEEE Transactions on Power Systems","3","12"

The problem is stochastically formulated in order to account for randomness in individual charger start-time and battery state-of-charge. The authors introduce a model that allows for partial harmonics cancellation due to diversity in magnitudes and phase angles. A general solution technique is presented along with an example using data from a commercially available EV charger. The results show that a limiting distribution of 7--10 chargers is adequate for accurately predicting harmonic injection currents using the Central Limit Theorem. The authors also show that the expected values of net harmonic currents are considerably less than the peak values that would have been realized if the same number of chargers were operated in unison.","","","","Electric Power Research Inst., Palo Alto, CA (United States)","","United States","1997-07-01T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: IEEE Transactions on Power Delivery; Journal Volume: 12; Journal Issue: 3; Other Information: DN: Paper presented at the 1996 IEEE/PES summer meeting, July 28--August 1, 1996, Denver, CO (US); PBD: Jul 1997","","Medium: X; Size: pp. 1258-1266","","","","Journal ID: ITPDE5; ISSN 0885-8977; TRN: IM9739%%98","10.1109/61.637002","","2009-12-16T00:00:00Z","522377","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/522377","","IEEE Transactions on Power Delivery","3","12"

Relays in different locations will detect greatly different currents during the same fault. This may be resolved by the use of the conventional per-unit time-current curve. However, many computer-aided time-current curve programs do not support this technique. The coordination of time overcurrent relays in this case can best be performed numerically using tables or spreadsheets. In addition, spreadsheet techniques may be used for setting other relays, such as feeder protection relays. An example of the coordination of an industrial power system with multiple generators connected through a synchronizing bus, which also has two utility ties, will be examined to illustrate these points.","","","","","","United States","1997-07-01T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: IEEE Transactions on Industry Applications; Journal Volume: 33; Journal Issue: 4; Other Information: DN: Paper presented at the 1996 Industry Applications Society annual meeting, October 6--10, San Diego, CA (US); PBD: Jul-Aug 1997","","Medium: X; Size: pp. 1096-1103","","","","Journal ID: ITIACR; ISSN 0093-9994; TRN: IM9746%%61","10.1109/28.605753","","2009-12-16T00:00:00Z","538136","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/538136","","IEEE Transactions on Industry Applications","4","33"

By looking at the harmonic-related losses in a specific electrical system--representing a commercial office building--energy savings and harmonic reduction benefits of different mitigation measures are quantified. Two single-phase and three three-phase active and passive harmonic filters are added to a typical building electrical system and evaluated by computer simulation. Current and voltage distortions are computed, and the estimated cost of these filters are compared to predicted losses in a power system where harmonic currents are not compensated.

Following the realization of high-field, high-current superconductors in 1961, researchers applied these type II materials, such as Nb-Ti and Nb{sub 3}Sn, to laboratory magnets, followed by generators, motors, and transmission cables. Successful prototypes for the latter were constructed and tested by the mid-1980s. It is fair to assume that widespread utility acceptance of these low-temperature superconducting (LTS) power applications was compromised by the necessity for liquid helium cooling. The discovery of the high-temperature superconductors (HTS) in 1986, which offered the prospect for liquid nitrogen cooling, provided renewed interest and impetus and spurred the development of HTS power components. The expectations for HTS power components are, in fact, near realization, as a result of the rapid worldwide progress in HTS wire and tape development. This paper will review the history and present status of superconducting power-system-related applications. The major problems facing this technology and the prospects for commercialization and eventual integration into the utility sector will be discussed. General acceptance for superconducting power equipment by the electric utilities and other end-users will ultimately be based on the respective system performance, efficiency, reliability and maintenance, operational lifetime, and installed cost compared to conventional technologies.","","","","","","United States","1997-06-01T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: Advances in Cryogenic Engineering; Journal Volume: 42B; Conference: CEC/ICMC `95: cryogenic engineering conference and international cryogenic materials conference, Columbus, OH (United States), 17-21 Jul 1995; Other Information: PBD: 1997","","Medium: X; Size: pp. 883-898","","CONF-950722-","","Journal ID: ACYEAC; ISSN 0065-2482; TRN: 97:001732-0051","","","2009-12-16T00:00:00Z","482099","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/482099","","Advances in Cryogenic Engineering","","42B"

If such a fault occurs, it can cause expensive damage to equipment and substantial revenue loss due to service interruption. A faulted element must, therefore, be disconnected without unnecessary delay. For this purpose, protective relays continuously monitor system elements (synchronous generators, transformers, transmission lines, motors, etc.) and isolate faulted elements by operating by operating circuit breakers. Originally, protective relays were designed containing electromechanical devices. Recently, however, rapid advances in digital-processor technology have prompted applying microprocessors to protective relays.

Each of these modules has been designed and implemented independently from the others by use of the expert system shell SMECI; the design of the whole UPS is realized under the control of a special module that rules the cooperation between the specialized experts. The results of this approach are presented, and the benefits of its application are pointed out.","","","","","","United States","1997-05-01T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: IEEE Transactions on Power Electronics; Journal Volume: 12; Journal Issue: 3; Other Information: PBD: May 1997","","Medium: X; Size: pp. 578-582","","","","Journal ID: ITPEE8; ISSN 0885-8993; TRN: IM9730%%14","10.1109/63.575685","","2009-12-16T00:00:00Z","492136","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/492136","","IEEE Transactions on Power Electronics","3","12"
"AGC simulator for price-based operation.

Through the passage of new public utility regulatory policies, the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (FERC) encourages an open market system for price based operation. Recently, the FERC has issued a notice of proposed rulemaking seeking comments on various ancillary services. One of these ancillary services is load following. This paper suggests the modifications required in the conventional AGC software to prepare students to study load following in price-based market operation. The details of implementing an academic power system are used to highlight the differences between the AGC operation in a vertically integrated industry (conventional paradigm) and a horizontally integrated industry (new paradigm). The future business environment for electric utilities is incompletely defined as of this writing. Therefore, a framework for price-based operation is developed to assist students in understanding AGC implementation in the new market structure. The proposed market structure is kept generic enough to capture all possibilities in marketing load following capability. Part 2 reports case study results of various load following contracts to illustrate the features of the proposed simulator model.","","","","","","United States","1997-05-01T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: IEEE Transactions on Power Systems; Journal Volume: 12; Journal Issue: 2; Other Information: DN: Presented at the 1996 IEEE/PES summer meeting, July 28--August 1, 1996, Denver, CO (US); PBD: May 1997","","Medium: X; Size: pp. 527-532","","","","Journal ID: ITPSEG; ISSN 0885-8950; TRN: IM9730%%15","10.1109/59.589593","","2009-12-16T00:00:00Z","492137","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/492137","","IEEE Transactions on Power Systems","2","12"

"Calculating short-run marginal costs of active and reactive power production","El-Keib, A A; Ma, X","24 POWER TRANSMISSION AND DISTRIBUTION; MARGINAL-COST PRICING; POWER GENERATION; CALCULATION METHODS; ECONOMICS; REAL TIME SYSTEMS","Proper pricing of active and reactive power is an important issue for economic and secure operations of power systems in an open transmission access (OTA) environment. This paper presents a flexible formulation for this purpose. The proposed formulation identifies an important price component for reactive power, which is fundamentally different from those existing in the literature. This makes the pricing of reactive power more understandable. The proposed approach is efficient for real-time application and allows for carrying out active and reactive power pricing simultaneously or independently through the use of the decoupled optimal power flow formulation. Price signals derived from this approach are quite meaningful from an engineering point of view. In addition, the proposed approach can be easily extended to evaluate NUGs and wheeling transactions. The paper includes test results on the 30- and 118-bus IEEE standard systems.","","","","","","United States","1997-05-01T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: IEEE Transactions on Power Systems; Journal Volume: 12; Journal Issue: 2; Other Information: PBD: May 1997","","Medium: X; Size: pp. 559-565","","","","Journal ID: ITPSEG; ISSN 0885-8950; TRN: 97:011894","10.1109/59.589604","","2009-12-16T00:00:00Z","492139","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/492139","","IEEE Transactions on Power Systems","2","12"

The combined hydrothermal unit commitment problem is solved by a decomposition and coordination approach. Thermal unit commitment is solved using a conventional Lagrangian relaxation technique. The hydro system is divided into watersheds, which are further broken down into reservoirs. The watersheds are optimized by Network Flow Programming (NFP). Priority-list-based Dynamic Programming is used to solve the Hydro Unit Commitment (HUC) problem at the reservoir level. A successive approximation method is used for updating the marginal water values (Lagrange multipliers) to improve the hydro unit commitment convergence, due to the large size and multiple couplings of water conservation constraints. The integration of the hydro unit commitment into the existing Hydro-Thermal Optimization (HTO) package greatly improves the quality of its solution in the PG and E power system.","","","","","","United States","1997-05-01T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: IEEE Transactions on Power Systems; Journal Volume: 12; Journal Issue: 2; Other Information: DN: Presented at the 1996 IEEE/PES summer meeting, July 28--August 1, 1996, Denver, CO (US); PBD: May 1997","","Medium: X; Size: pp. 764-769","","","","Journal ID: ITPSEG; ISSN 0885-8950; TRN: IM9730%%22","","","2009-12-16T00:00:00Z","492144","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/492144","","IEEE Transactions on Power Systems","2","12"

The purpose of the model is to represent the generation characteristic of the hydro plants accurately. In the modelling part the paper focuses on two requests stated from power producers in an earlier study. First, it is desirable to operate on points with good efficiency. Second, start-ups and shut-downs of the units should not be carried out too often, since this is related to a cost. The problem is decomposed into a subproblem for each hydro power plant by relaxing the power balance equation and using variable splitting. The advantage of this relaxation is that the authors can use network programming and dynamic programming methods, which have proved to work well for power system planning issues. The relaxation used in this work has not been applied in the field before. The master problem is solved by a subgradient technique. Finally, a numerical example from a part of the Swedish power system illustrates the technique.","","","","","","United States","1997-05-01T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: IEEE Transactions on Power Systems; Journal Volume: 12; Journal Issue: 2; Other Information: DN: Presented at the 1996 IEEE/PES summer meeting, July 28--August 1, 1996, Denver, CO (US); PBD: May 1997","","Medium: X; Size: pp. 770-775","","","","Journal ID: ITPSEG; ISSN 0885-8950; TRN: IM9730%%23","10.1109/59.589678","","2009-12-16T00:00:00Z","492145","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/492145","","IEEE Transactions on Power Systems","2","12"

The authors present a new methodology for estimating the cost of power outages in the business and public sections and illustrate with data for Israel. The methodology is based on the principle of revealed preference, the cost of an outage may be inferred from the actions taken by consumers to mitigate losses induced by unsupplied electricity. If outages impose costs on businesses, managers are likely to invest in back-up power to mitigate the losses that are incurred when electricity is not supplied. Investment in back-up generators may then be used to impute the mitigated and unmitigated damage from outages. 12 refs., 3 figs., 7 tabs.","","","","USDOE","","United States","1997-05-01T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: Energy Journal; Journal Volume: 18; Journal Issue: 2; Other Information: PBD: 1997","","Medium: X; Size: pp. 39-61","","","","Journal ID: ENJODN; ISSN 0195-6574; TRN: 97:002550-0003","10.5547/ISSN0195-6574-EJ-Vol18-No2-3","","2016-05-16T00:00:00Z","460068","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/460068","","Energy Journal","2","18"

Using the IEC/IEEE DGA criteria as references, a preliminary framework of the fuzzy diagnosis system is first built. Based on previous dissolved gas test records and their actual fault types, the proposed EP-based development technique is then employed to automatically modify the fuzzy if-then rules and simultaneously adjust the corresponding membership functions. In comparison to results of the conventional DGA and the artificial neural networks (ANN) classification methods, the proposed method has been verified to possess superior performance both in developing the diagnosis system and in identifying the practical transformer fault cases.","","","","","","United States","1997-04-01T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: IEEE Transactions on Power Delivery; Journal Volume: 12; Journal Issue: 2; Conference: 1996 Summer meeting of the IEEE Power Engineering Society, Denver, CO (United States), 28 Jul - 1 Aug 1996; Other Information: PBD: Apr 1997","","Medium: X; Size: pp. 761-767","","CONF-960725-","","Journal ID: ITPDE5; ISSN 0885-8977; TRN: IM9730%%74","10.1109/61.584363","","2009-12-16T00:00:00Z","492195","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/492195","","IEEE Transactions on Power Delivery","2","12"

These methods can be applied to any transformer of similar construction by simply changing the input data, and they can be used for most other single-phase transformers with small modifications. The approximate method is a technique for calculating the change in iron-core losses which can be done without a computer. The finite-element computer model performs a quasi three-dimensional field analysis on the iron-core region and calculates the flux density (B) and iron-core losses in each finite element, as well as the magnetizing and core-loss currents. The results of either method can be used as pre-processing for a (harmonic) power flow program.","","","","Electric Power Research Inst., Palo Alto, CA (United States)","","United States","1997-04-01T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: IEEE Transactions on Power Delivery; Journal Volume: 12; Journal Issue: 2; Conference: 1996 Summer meeting of the IEEE Power Engineering Society, Denver, CO (United States), 28 Jul - 1 Aug 1996; Other Information: PBD: Apr 1997","","Medium: X; Size: pp. 768-774","","CONF-960725-","","Journal ID: ITPDE5; ISSN 0885-8977; TRN: IM9730%%75","10.1109/61.584366","","2009-12-16T00:00:00Z","492196","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/492196","","IEEE Transactions on Power Delivery","2","12"

A one-line fault on the higher insulated circuit is either a shielding failure or a mid-span back-flashover. To discriminate shielding failures and mid-span back-flashovers among all the faults, the author analyzed the lightning performance of these unbalanced insulation lines. Both the unbalanced insulation lines and the balanced insulation lines are similar in the probability of causing a shielding failure and a mid-span back-flashover, since both are the same in the configuration of shielding wires and phase conductors independent of the insulation mode. As a result of analysis, the author estimated that about 25--40% of all the lightning faults on the double-circuit balanced insulation lines are shielding failures, and that few mid-span back-flashovers happen there.","","","","","","United States","1997-04-01T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: IEEE Transactions on Power Delivery; Journal Volume: 12; Journal Issue: 2; Conference: 1996 Summer meeting of the IEEE Power Engineering Society, Denver, CO (United States), 28 Jul - 1 Aug 1996; Other Information: PBD: Apr 1997","","Medium: X; Size: pp. 832-836","","CONF-960725-","","Journal ID: ITPDE5; ISSN 0885-8977; TRN: IM9730%%77","10.1109/61.584393","","2009-12-16T00:00:00Z","492198","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/492198","","IEEE Transactions on Power Delivery","2","12"

Porcelain rods coated with RTV silicone rubber to a thickness from 0.17 to 0.99 mm were studied. The dependence of current pulse rate and cumulative number of current pulses on coating thickness were determined as a function of time of exposure to combined electric stress and salt-fog. The surface roughness and the total content of low molecular weight (LMW) silicone fluid in the coating were measured before and after the salt-fog test as a function of coating thickness. The effects of heating the RTV in an electric oven on the production and loss of LMW silicone fluid were investigated in order to elucidate the influence of the heat generated by dry band discharges. The loss of weight of RTV at high temperatures (370 C) due to the decomposition of the alumina trihydrate filler into alumina and water was measured and found to be close to the theoretical value.","","","","","","United States","1997-04-01T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: IEEE Transactions on Power Delivery; Journal Volume: 12; Journal Issue: 2; Conference: 1996 Summer meeting of the IEEE Power Engineering Society, Denver, CO (United States), 28 Jul - 1 Aug 1996; Other Information: PBD: Apr 1997","","Medium: X; Size: pp. 857-866","","CONF-960725-","","Journal ID: ITPDE5; ISSN 0885-8977; TRN: IM9730%%81","10.1109/61.584405","","2009-12-16T00:00:00Z","492202","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/492202","","IEEE Transactions on Power Delivery","2","12"

This forms the basis for an effective and accurate evaluation of ac/dc converter harmonics, especially for the investigation of parameter dependencies and for the application in harmonic distortion studies. Selected examples demonstrate particularly the analytical description of the discrete dc currents.","","","","","","United States","1997-04-01T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: IEEE Transactions on Power Delivery; Journal Volume: 12; Journal Issue: 2; Conference: 1996 Summer meeting of the IEEE Power Engineering Society, Denver, CO (United States), 28 Jul - 1 Aug 1996; Other Information: PBD: Apr 1997","","Medium: X; Size: pp. 874-880","","CONF-960725-","","Journal ID: ITPDE5; ISSN 0885-8977; TRN: IM9730%%83","10.1109/61.584407","","2009-12-16T00:00:00Z","492204","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/492204","","IEEE Transactions on Power Delivery","2","12"
"The use of decoupled converters to optimize the power electronics of shunt and series ac system controllers","Raju, N R; Venkata, S S; Sastry, V V","24 POWER TRANSMISSION AND DISTRIBUTION; VAR CONTROL SYSTEMS; POWER DISTRIBUTION SYSTEMS; AC SYSTEMS; ELECTRIC CONTROLLERS; STABILIZATION; POWER TRANSMISSION","This paper presents a decoupled converter approach for solid-state compensation of ac power systems. The scheme employs a multi-step inverter for control of fundamental frequency components and PWM inverters for harmonic compensation. The inverters are arranged in such a manner that the high-frequency harmonic compensation module uses inverters of low power rating, while the slow-switching fundamental frequency compensation module supports most of the stresses. This decoupled approach is expected to result in a significant reduction in cost and losses associated with active compensators for high-power applications. The basic principle of operation, circuit structures and control strategy for shunt and series compensation based on the decoupled approach are described. Computer simulation and experimental results are presented to demonstrate the performance of the proposed system.","","","","","","United States","1997-04-01T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: IEEE Transactions on Power Delivery; Journal Volume: 12; Journal Issue: 2; Conference: 1996 Summer meeting of the IEEE Power Engineering Society, Denver, CO (United States), 28 Jul - 1 Aug 1996; Other Information: PBD: Apr 1997","","Medium: X; Size: pp. 895-900","","CONF-960725-","","Journal ID: ITPDE5; ISSN 0885-8977; TRN: IM9730%%85","10.1109/61.584410","","2009-12-16T00:00:00Z","492206","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/492206","","IEEE Transactions on Power Delivery","2","12"

In the new approach, power system transients are simulated using an Electromagnetic Transients Program (EMTP), while protective relays can be modeled using any high level language or commercially available software package, such as MATLAB. The interactions between power systems and relays are implemented by using an interaction buffer. Using this technique, the EMTP can be run in single-step, multiple-step, or mixed mode.

This paper describes some of the early findings of current-cycling tests on 4,000 kcmil aluminum cable connectors and defines the need for more stringent qualification test specifications. Use of the ANSI C119.4 light-duty (125 cycles) test specification revealed a strong dependency on basic parameters such as surface roughness, dimension, type and surface finish of hardware, surface preparation, mounting techniques, etc. The first batch of test samples failed dramatically at an early stage in the current and load cycling tests.

"Decomposition of transformer oils: A new approach for the determination of dissolved gases","Jalbert, J; Gilbert, R","24 POWER TRANSMISSION AND DISTRIBUTION; INSULATING OILS; TRANSFORMERS; DECOMPOSITION; CHROMATOGRAPHY; MAINTENANCE; SENSITIVITY; DISSOLVED GASES","The possibility of using a static headspace sampling technique for introducing gases into a chromatograph and performing dissolved-gas analysis automatically was demonstrated in a previous work. The main drawback of the method was the relatively long time that the analytes take to equilibrate between the oil and the headspace. In this paper, the application of mechanical agitation to a viscous matrix to enhance diffusion of the species during the equilibration period was investigated together with the use of an improved nickel catalyst system and a new porous-layer open tubular chromatographic column. The analytical performance of the technique is established and compared with that of method A of the ASTM D 3612 standard procedure. The comparison shows that the technique can be used to assess dissolved gases with the same precision (overall precision <5% at medium concentration) in a much shorter time (first sample in 55 min; 25 min for each subsequent sample) with a higher sensitivity of detection (0.6, 11, 11.2, 0.06, 0.09, 0.1, 0.05, 0.04, 0.04 and 0.2 ppm (v/v) for H{sub 2}, O{sub 2}, N{sub 2}, CH{sub 4}, CO, CO{sub 2}, C{sub 2}H{sub 2}, C{sub 2}H{sub 4}, C{sub 2}H{sub 6} and C{sub 3}H{sub 8}, respectively). An excellent correlation was observed between the analytical results of the two techniques applied to 35 transformer oil samples. The high sensitivity of detection achieved means that transformer fault diagnosis can now be extended to equipment newly commissioned or apparatus other than open breathing equipment, where the total gas content in oil is very low.","","","","","","United States","1997-04-01T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: IEEE Transactions on Power Delivery; Journal Volume: 12; Journal Issue: 2; Conference: 1996 Summer meeting of the IEEE Power Engineering Society, Denver, CO (United States), 28 Jul - 1 Aug 1996; Other Information: PBD: Apr 1997","","Medium: X; Size: pp. 754-760","","CONF-960725-","","Journal ID: ITPDE5; ISSN 0885-8977; TRN: IM9730%%73","10.1109/61.584362","","2009-12-16T00:00:00Z","492194","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/492194","","IEEE Transactions on Power Delivery","2","12"

The model treats the leakage inductances and the coupling effects of the core in a straightforward and integrated way. The long-established positive- and zero-sequence star equivalent circuits of a three-phase three-winding transformer are derived from the original equivalent magnetic circuit of the transformer by applying duality. Formulations for determining the values of the leakage inductances and the core loss resistances from transformer open- and short-circuit test data are presented. A supporting routine is written to generate the {lambda}-i curves for each segment of the core and the other input data for EMTP. Since the duality-derived model consists of only RLC elements, no device-specific code to EMTP time-step code is needed. Winding capacitances are lumped to the terminals. The model is suitable for simulation of power system low-frequency transients such as inrush currents and ferroresonance, short circuits, and abnormalities including transformer winding faults.","","","","USDOE","","United States","1997-04-01T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: IEEE Transactions on Power Delivery; Journal Volume: 12; Journal Issue: 2; Conference: 1996 Summer meeting of the IEEE Power Engineering Society, Denver, CO (United States), 28 Jul - 1 Aug 1996; Other Information: PBD: Apr 1997","","Medium: X; Size: pp. 775-782","","CONF-960725-","","Journal ID: ITPDE5; ISSN 0885-8977; TRN: IM9730%%76","10.1109/61.584369","","2016-04-29T00:00:00Z","492197","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/492197","","IEEE Transactions on Power Delivery","2","12"

New developments in a loss reduction formula, problem formulations, solution methodology and mathematical justification are presented. The problem is decoupled into two subproblems: the capacitor placement subproblem and the real-time control subproblem. An effective solution algorithm for placing capacitors and determining their real-time control schemes for general unbalanced distribution systems is proposed. To meet the need for efficient implementation in real-time environments, a fast pseudo gradient type mechanism for deriving capacitor control settings is incorporated into the solution algorithms. A quadratic integer programming based approach is proposed to determine the number, locations and sizing of capacitors to be placed in the distribution systems. The subproblem of determining capacitor control settings under varying loading conditions is formulated as another quadratic integer programming problem. Mathematical justification is provided to show that the proposed algorithms are guaranteed to yield local optimal solutions. Numerical studies on the determination of capacitor number, size, location and real-time control schemes on large-scale unbalanced distribution systems under nonlinear load variations are presented in great detail in the companion paper.","","","","USDOE","","United States","1997-04-01T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: IEEE Transactions on Power Delivery; Journal Volume: 12; Journal Issue: 2; Conference: IEEE/PES transmission and distribution conference and exposition: a crossroad of technology and change, Los Angeles, CA (United States), 15-20 Sep 1996; Other Information: PBD: Apr 1997","","Medium: X; Size: pp. 953-958","","CONF-9609171-","","Journal ID: ITPDE5; ISSN 0885-8977; TRN: IM9730%%91","10.1109/61.584419","","2016-05-24T00:00:00Z","492212","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/492212","","IEEE Transactions on Power Delivery","2","12"

This pressure, coupled with the decreasing availability of reserve margins dictates that there is a requirement for comprehensive system operation support through, among other things, the provision of quality information relating to the behavior of the primary and secondary systems. This paper will show how the data available within modern substation control and management systems can be exploited in a cost-effective manner, through the implementation of advanced substation functions in an open systems environment. Certain functions which are presently carried out at the control center could be distributed (or partially distributed) to the substation. These functions may provide the utility staff with quality information, which can in turn be used to satisfy the objectives of increasing quality and security of supply, in addition to optimizing the utility`s information, maintenance and asset management functions.","","","","","","United States","1997-04-01T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: IEEE Transactions on Power Delivery; Journal Volume: 12; Journal Issue: 2; Conference: IEEE/PES transmission and distribution conference and exposition: a crossroad of technology and change, Los Angeles, CA (United States), 15-20 Sep 1996; Other Information: PBD: Apr 1997","","Medium: X; Size: pp. 700-706","","CONF-9609171-","","Journal ID: ITPDE5; ISSN 0885-8977; TRN: IM9730%%65","10.1109/61.584351","","2009-12-16T00:00:00Z","492186","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/492186","","IEEE Transactions on Power Delivery","2","12"

The advantages of the method are based on the simplicity and accuracy of the formulae for solving uniform lumped parameter ladder circuits of any size and under any terminal conditions. The formulae are obtained by applying the general equations of the line represented by discrete parameters on a specific electrical circuit formed by a transmission line ground wire during ground faults. The paper also derives simple and exact expressions for solving ladder circuits formed by the discretization of underground conductors which are in continuous contact with earth (e.g., the sheaths of a cable, an interconnecting copper buried in the soil, a pipeline, etc.). The correct prediction of the expected ground fault current parts in soil and neutral conductors is of great importance in designing safe and economical substation grounding installations.","","","","","","United States","1997-04-01T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: IEEE Transactions on Power Delivery; Journal Volume: 12; Journal Issue: 2; Conference: IEEE/PES transmission and distribution conference and exposition: a crossroad of technology and change, Los Angeles, CA (United States), 15-20 Sep 1996; Other Information: PBD: Apr 1997","","Medium: X; Size: pp. 722-727","","CONF-9609171-","","Journal ID: ITPDE5; ISSN 0885-8977; TRN: IM9730%%68","10.1109/61.584356","","2009-12-16T00:00:00Z","492189","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/492189","","IEEE Transactions on Power Delivery","2","12"

Calculation shows no risk of puncture on the quality insulators for the impulse voltages of 2,500 kV/{micro}s steepness which is required by the standards.","","","","","","United States","1997-04-01T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: IEEE Transactions on Power Delivery; Journal Volume: 12; Journal Issue: 2; Conference: 1996 Summer meeting of the IEEE Power Engineering Society, Denver, CO (United States), 28 Jul - 1 Aug 1996; Other Information: PBD: Apr 1997","","Medium: X; Size: pp. 850-856","","CONF-960725-","","Journal ID: ITPDE5; ISSN 0885-8977; TRN: IM9730%%80","10.1109/61.584404","","2009-12-16T00:00:00Z","492201","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/492201","","IEEE Transactions on Power Delivery","2","12"
"Novel calculation of HVDC converter harmonics by linearization in the time-domain","Perkins, B K; Iravani, M R","24 POWER TRANSMISSION AND DISTRIBUTION; HVDC SYSTEMS; DC TO DC CONVERTERS; HARMONICS; POWER CONDITIONING CIRCUITS; POWER TRANSMISSION","There is an increasing interest in the steady-state analysis of high power converter circuits for the computation of both characteristic and uncharacteristic harmonics. Uncharacteristic harmonics arise due to asymmetries in excitation/operation and are of particular interest given their overall adverse effect on the power system. Frequency domain methods for harmonic analysis are efficient though not necessarily comprehensive; that is not all the necessary details of the system are simultaneously modeled. This paper presents a novel technique that is both efficient and comprehensive as the time domain nature of the differential/algebraic equations describing the converter operation is retained. Efficient convergence of the time domain boundary value problem is assured by an appropriate linearization. Subsequent Fourier analysis of the time domain solution yields the harmonic spectra. Comparison is made with time domain steady-state solutions obtained by brute-force computation.","","","","","","United States","1997-04-01T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: IEEE Transactions on Power Delivery; Journal Volume: 12; Journal Issue: 2; Conference: 1996 Summer meeting of the IEEE Power Engineering Society, Denver, CO (United States), 28 Jul - 1 Aug 1996; Other Information: PBD: Apr 1997","","Medium: X; Size: pp. 867-873","","CONF-960725-","","Journal ID: ITPDE5; ISSN 0885-8977; TRN: IM9730%%82","10.1109/61.584406","","2009-12-16T00:00:00Z","492203","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/492203","","IEEE Transactions on Power Delivery","2","12"

The measurements were performed using a coaxial measurement arrangement with different bundle and conductor types. The effects of conductor and bundle type, temperature, applied voltage and hoar frost thickness on corona losses were investigated. A two-conductor bundle had corona losses about 2.5--5 times higher than a three-conductor bundle. Relatively thin hoar frosts were used in the tests. Even the thinnest hoar frost resulted in remarkable corona losses and the losses were very sensitive to changes in the hoar frost thickness. The ambient temperature had a strong influence on the measured losses.","","","","","","United States","1997-04-01T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: IEEE Transactions on Power Delivery; Journal Volume: 12; Journal Issue: 2; Conference: 1996 Summer meeting of the IEEE Power Engineering Society, Denver, CO (United States), 28 Jul - 1 Aug 1996; Other Information: PBD: Apr 1997","","Medium: X; Size: pp. 928-933","","CONF-960725-","","Journal ID: ITPDE5; ISSN 0885-8977; TRN: IM9730%%88","10.1109/61.584415","","2009-12-16T00:00:00Z","492209","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/492209","","IEEE Transactions on Power Delivery","2","12"

These insulators are not always tested electrically during manufacture. Undetected internal failures in an insulator may endanger workers performing live line maintenance on the insulators. The live line maintenance requires careful testing of each insulator before use. For the selection of the most effective test method, insulators were purposely made with internal flaws and then subjected to megger, hot stick, partial discharge and RIV tests as well as measurement of the total and surface component of leakage current, together with surface heating measurement. The most sensitive method is the RIV test, which identified 6 insulators with flaws. The partial discharge and hot stick tests found 4 insulators with embedded wire. From a practical point of view, the modified hot stick test seems to be suitable for field test of the insulators.","","","","","","United States","1997-04-01T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: IEEE Transactions on Power Delivery; Journal Volume: 12; Journal Issue: 2; Conference: IEEE/PES transmission and distribution conference and exposition: a crossroad of technology and change, Los Angeles, CA (United States), 15-20 Sep 1996; Other Information: PBD: Apr 1997","","Medium: X; Size: pp. 965-970","","CONF-9609171-","","Journal ID: ITPDE5; ISSN 0885-8977; TRN: IM9730%%93","10.1109/61.584421","","2009-12-16T00:00:00Z","492214","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/492214","","IEEE Transactions on Power Delivery","2","12"

Traditional load modeling techniques used for distribution power flows are designed for system peak studies, and are not suitable for providing real-time statistical load estimates. This paper presents a real-time load modeling technique which incorporates the use of customer class curves and provides a measure of the uncertainty (statistics) in the estimates. It also incorporates the possibility of multiple line flow measurements and makes use of customer billing information. The load modeling technique is combined with a probabilistic distribution circuit state estimation algorithm. Results of the combined load modeling and state estimation algorithm are provided on an actual 934-bus distribution circuit illustrating its feasibility.","","","","","","United States","1997-04-01T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: IEEE Transactions on Power Delivery; Journal Volume: 12; Journal Issue: 2; Conference: IEEE/PES transmission and distribution conference and exposition: a crossroad of technology and change, Los Angeles, CA (United States), 15-20 Sep 1996; Other Information: PBD: Apr 1997","","Medium: X; Size: pp. 999-1005","","CONF-9609171-","","Journal ID: ITPDE5; ISSN 0885-8977; TRN: IM9730%%96","10.1109/61.584427","","2009-12-16T00:00:00Z","492217","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/492217","","IEEE Transactions on Power Delivery","2","12"

In the family of EMTP-type programs, these profile calculations are normally made by explicitly connecting a number of short line sections to create intermediate nodes where voltages and currents can be monitored. This approach is time-consuming, computationally intensive and can be inaccurate if the number of intermediate nodes is large. The model presented here allows the accurate evaluation of voltages and currents at an arbitrary number of equally-spaced points along the line. The frequency dependence of the line parameters is taken into account.

"Intelligent system identifies and locates transmission faults","Hong, H W; Colwell, D H","24 POWER TRANSMISSION AND DISTRIBUTION; POWER TRANSMISSION LINES; ELECTRICAL FAULTS; POWER SYSTEMS; POWER TRANSMISSION; DETECTION; AVAILABILITY; OUTAGES","Intelligent Fault Locator (IFL) is a PC/Windows-based operator`s tool that uses two-ended loop fault analysis to identify fault types and location. When faults occur on major transmission lines, the bulk power system is immediately exposed to potentially costly outages. During peak loading conditions, when line availability is most critical, a lengthy outage can be detrimental to system operations. In an age of open access and retail wheeling, power exchanges are bound by contract, and any unnecessary delay of energy restoration compromises a utility`s competitive position. It is necessary for protection and operation personnel to locate the fault as accurately and as expeditiously as possible. Within large utility systems, major transmission lines are located in remote or inaccessible areas, which makes fault finding difficult. The combination of using a two-ended algorithm along with the advent of improved communication technology, mathematical techniques, and PC applications made possible the development of an automatic fault location system. The system is innovative in its integration of mature, low cost, and reliable instrumentation, combined with advanced applied mathematics to achieve a mission-critical system for electric system maintenance and operation.","","","","","","United States","1997-04-01T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: IEEE Computer Applications in Power; Journal Volume: 10; Journal Issue: 2; Other Information: PBD: Apr 1997","","Medium: X; Size: pp. 31-35","","","","Journal ID: ICAPEH; ISSN 0895-0156; TRN: IM9730%%38","10.1109/67.582449","","2009-12-16T00:00:00Z","492159","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/492159","","IEEE Computer Applications in Power","2","10"
"Triggering tradeoffs for recording dynamics","Schulz, R P; Laios, B B","24 POWER TRANSMISSION AND DISTRIBUTION; MONITORS; POWER SYSTEMS; RESPONSE FUNCTIONS; ELECTRICAL TRANSIENTS; INSTABILITY; STABILIZATION","Dynamics recording devices (DRD) that monitor and record the transient or dynamic response of power systems are installed across power systems. DRDs that have been installed in the last decade have increasingly used digital computer implementation; these include digital relays, digital fault recorders, integrated electronic controls for substation automation, and many digitally implemented controls such as excitation system controls and stabilizers. The system dynamics of interest generally lie in the frequency range below 5 Hz and may require recordings up to 2 to 5 minutes. This timeframe includes the times for transient instability, oscillatory instability, and governing responses, as well as the initial responses of secondary controls including power plant controls and automatic generation control (AGC). In some applications, the frequency range may be greater for monitoring the faster dynamics associated with flexible alternating current transmission system (FACTS) devices and subsynchronous oscillatory interactions. Recordings from DRDs are used for event reconstruction, review of the action of control and protection systems, and detection of unexpected dynamics within the power system. In recent years, DRDs have been recognized as viable options for data to be used in control functions, including those associated with FACTS devices. DRDs and monitoring systems need triggering algorithms and settings that dependably and securely detect unusual events in the presence of normal power system events such as switching, customer load changes, and other routine operations. This article describes how to address these needs.","","","","","","United States","1997-04-01T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: IEEE Computer Applications in Power; Journal Volume: 10; Journal Issue: 2; Other Information: PBD: Apr 1997","","Medium: X; Size: pp. 44-49","","","","Journal ID: ICAPEH; ISSN 0895-0156; TRN: IM9730%%41","10.1109/67.582452","","2009-12-16T00:00:00Z","492162","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/492162","","IEEE Computer Applications in Power","2","10"

Crosslinked polyethylene (XLPE) insulated cables have many advantages over the traditional fluid-filled pressurized cable system with the elimination of the hydraulic system and the associated equipment and complications during the installation and operation/maintenance of such systems. Other advantages of the extruded cable system arise from the new accessory technologies and the use of splices and terminations that are prefabricated and pretested in the factory and require less time to install on site. Concerns over the long term reliability of high voltage cable systems, in particular the accessories and the lack of service experience above 300 kV led to the decision of Hydro-Quebec to carry out a prequalification (long-term) test program to assess the reliability of the cable materials and to verify the cable and accessory installation methods to be employed. The cables were installed in duct banks and manholes simulating actual installation conditions used in Hydro-Quebec underground cable network. This paper describes the program and results of the prequalification tests of 345-kV XLPE cables and accessories performed at Hydro-Quebec`s Research Institute (IREQ) in partnership with three international cable manufacturers, Alcatel, Fujikura and Pirelli.","","","","","","United States","1997-04-01T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: IEEE Transactions on Power Delivery; Journal Volume: 12; Journal Issue: 2; Conference: IEEE/PES transmission and distribution conference and exposition: a crossroad of technology and change, Los Angeles, CA (United States), 15-20 Sep 1996; Other Information: PBD: Apr 1997","","Medium: X; Size: pp. 547-550","","CONF-9609171-","","Journal ID: ITPDE5; ISSN 0885-8977; TRN: IM9730%%50","10.1109/61.584319","","2009-12-16T00:00:00Z","492171","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/492171","","IEEE Transactions on Power Delivery","2","12"

The article describes the methodology used to establish the voltage duration and magnitude of VLF (0.1 Hz) high voltage field tests suitable for crosslinked polyethylene (XLPE) insulated power cable. The results show that the voltage breakdown of laboratory aged XLPE cable at 0.1 Hz is approximately equal to that at 60 Hz, that proof tests at 0.1 Hz is approximately equal to that at 60 Hz, that proof tests at 0.1 Hz cause very little damage to the cable, and that 0.1 Hz testing appears to be a satisfactory alternate to dc testing. Preliminary values are suggested for voltage magnitude and time duration of cable acceptance, maintenance and proof tests at 0.1 Hz for XLPE cable rated up to 35 kV. A program is underway to similarly evaluate samples of service-aged XLPE cable; as well as to demonstrate the use of the preliminary test values at typical utility installations.","","","","Electric Power Research Inst., Palo Alto, CA (United States)","","United States","1997-04-01T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: IEEE Transactions on Power Delivery; Journal Volume: 12; Journal Issue: 2; Conference: IEEE/PES transmission and distribution conference and exposition: a crossroad of technology and change, Los Angeles, CA (United States), 15-20 Sep 1996; Other Information: PBD: Apr 1997","","Medium: X; Size: pp. 565-570","","CONF-9609171-","","Journal ID: ITPDE5; ISSN 0885-8977; TRN: IM9730%%53","10.1109/61.584323","","2009-12-16T00:00:00Z","492174","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/492174","","IEEE Transactions on Power Delivery","2","12"

"Application of current limiting fuses in distribution systems for improved power quality and protection","Kojovic, L; Hassler, S","24 POWER TRANSMISSION AND DISTRIBUTION; POWER DISTRIBUTION SYSTEMS; THRESHOLD CURRENT; CURRENT LIMITERS; ELECTRIC POWER; QUALITY CONTROL; STABILIZATION; E CODES","This paper presents a comparative analysis of the effects of distribution system expulsion and current limiting fuse operations on power quality. To perform this analysis, digital fuse models were developed for use with the EMTP/ATP program. Expulsion fuses interrupt current at current zeros and are easily modeled. Current limiting fuses (CLFs) interrupt current by forcing a current zero and therefore, require a special modeling technique. CLFs were modeled by representing them as nonlinear resistances. The nonlinear resistances were calculated using laboratory test results of actual CLF operations. This technique is very convenient for simulating CLF operations and analyzing their interaction with the distribution system. This paper shows that CLFs improve power quality by supporting system voltage during faults and reducing voltage dip duration. Additionally, CLFs reduce the fault let-through l{sup 2}t.","","","","","","United States","1997-04-01T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: IEEE Transactions on Power Delivery; Journal Volume: 12; Journal Issue: 2; Other Information: DN: Presented at the 1996 IEEE/PES winter meeting, January 21--25, Baltimore, MD (US); PBD: Apr 1997","","Medium: X; Size: pp. 791-800","","","","Journal ID: ITPDE5; ISSN 0885-8977; TRN: IM9730%%44","10.1109/61.584376","","2009-12-16T00:00:00Z","492165","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/492165","","IEEE Transactions on Power Delivery","2","12"
"Automated fault location and diagnosis on electric power distribution feeders","Zhu, J; Lubkeman, D L; Girgis, A A","24 POWER TRANSMISSION AND DISTRIBUTION; ELECTRICAL FAULTS; POWER DISTRIBUTION SYSTEMS; DETECTION; AUTOMATION; SYSTEMS ANALYSIS; ELECTRICAL TRANSIENTS","This paper presents new techniques for locating and diagnosing faults on electric power distribution feeders. The proposed fault location and diagnosis scheme is capable of accurately identifying the location of a fault upon its occurrence, based on the integration of information available from disturbance recording devices with knowledge contained in a distribution feeder database. The developed fault location and diagnosis system can also be applied to the investigation of temporary faults that may not result in a blown fuse. The proposed fault location algorithm is based on the steady-state analysis of the faulted distribution network. To deal with the uncertainties inherent in the system modeling and the phasor estimation, the fault location algorithm has been adapted to estimate fault regions based on probabilistic modeling and analysis. Since the distribution feeder is a radial network, multiple possibilities of fault locations could be computed with measurements available only at the substation. To identify the actual fault location, a fault diagnosis algorithm has been developed to prune down and rank the possible fault locations by integrating the available pieces of evidence. Testing of the developed fault location and diagnosis system using field data has demonstrated its potential for practical use.","","","","","","United States","1997-04-01T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: IEEE Transactions on Power Delivery; Journal Volume: 12; Journal Issue: 2; Other Information: DN: >Presented at the 1996 IEEE/PES winter meeting, January 21--25, Baltimore, MD (US); PBD: Apr 1997","","Medium: X; Size: pp. 801-809","","","","Journal ID: ITPDE5; ISSN 0885-8977; TRN: IM9730%%45","","","2009-12-16T00:00:00Z","492166","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/492166","","IEEE Transactions on Power Delivery","2","12"
"Modeling of altitude effects on AC flashover of polluted high voltage insulators","Rizk, F A.M.; Rezazada, A Q","24 POWER TRANSMISSION AND DISTRIBUTION; ELECTRICAL INSULATORS; FLASHOVER; MATHEMATICAL MODELS; DIELECTRIC PROPERTIES; SURFACE CONTAMINATION","The paper introduces a new physical approach to account for the effect of reduced air density on the flashover voltage and critical leakage current of polluted high voltage insulators. The analysis starts by updating the mathematical model, previously established, of power frequency flashover of polluted insulators at normal atmospheric pressure. It then proceeds to introduce the effect of ambient pressure on the physical parameters of the dielectric recovery equation. The effect of reduced pressure on the arc boundary radius is investigated. The combined effect of humidity and reduced air density on the dielectric strength at ambient temperature is also accounted for. The above analysis results in a new expression for the reignition voltage which includes ambient pressure effects. The analytical findings are then used to investigate the effect of reduced air density on the critical leakage current and flashover voltage of simple-shaped polluted insulators. The effect of more complex profiles is subsequently introduced. The model results are compared with experiments and the agreement established is quite satisfactory. Finally simple practical altitude correction factors for polluted insulators are proposed.","","","","","","United States","1997-04-01T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: IEEE Transactions on Power Delivery; Journal Volume: 12; Journal Issue: 2; Other Information: DN: Presented at the 1996 IEEE/PES winter meeting, January 21--25, Baltimore, MD (US); PBD: Apr 1997","","Medium: X; Size: pp. 810-815","","","","Journal ID: ITPDE5; ISSN 0885-8977; TRN: IM9730%%46","10.1109/61.584384","","2009-12-16T00:00:00Z","492167","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/492167","","IEEE Transactions on Power Delivery","2","12"

Cables insulated with conventional XLPE and a commercially available TR XLPE were used as reference test populations to affirm the test methodology. Under the chosen conditions, cable life of the new TR XLPE as calculated using Weibull and log normal statistical distributions, was more than twice that for the reference TRXLPE. Extensive diagnostic measurements (water content, dissipation factor, water tree analysis) were performed on failed cable samples to bring out the differences between the three insulations. Electron micrographic investigations revealed the size and distribution of micro voids in the new TR XLPE to be smaller supporting its extended life under these tests. The experimental details of the accelerated life tests are also documented in a clear manner facilitating any archival of the data for future analysis and comparison.","","","","","","United States","1997-04-01T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: IEEE Transactions on Power Delivery; Journal Volume: 12; Journal Issue: 2; Conference: IEEE/PES transmission and distribution conference and exposition: a crossroad of technology and change, Los Angeles, CA (United States), 15-20 Sep 1996; Other Information: PBD: Apr 1997","","Medium: X; Size: pp. 551-559","","CONF-9609171-","","Journal ID: ITPDE5; ISSN 0885-8977; TRN: IM9730%%51","10.1109/61.584320","","2009-12-16T00:00:00Z","492172","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/492172","","IEEE Transactions on Power Delivery","2","12"

These requirements generate the need for two power sources switched in and out by a computer-controlled relay. This relay must have contact current carrying capabilities equal to that of the cable on test. For large conductor sizes this expense becomes formidable. A method of making accurate ohm measurements of the connectors without connecting or disconnecting the conductor is given in this paper. Automation of the test can be established for a minimal investment with the information given. Automation will allow more information to be gathered, which will lead to the connector aging process being better understood and controlled.","","","","","","United States","1997-04-01T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: IEEE Transactions on Power Delivery; Journal Volume: 12; Journal Issue: 2; Conference: IEEE/PES transmission and distribution conference and exposition: a crossroad of technology and change, Los Angeles, CA (United States), 15-20 Sep 1996; Other Information: PBD: Apr 1997","","Medium: X; Size: pp. 560-564","","CONF-9609171-","","Journal ID: ITPDE5; ISSN 0885-8977; TRN: IM9730%%52","10.1109/61.584322","","2009-12-16T00:00:00Z","492173","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/492173","","IEEE Transactions on Power Delivery","2","12"

To date diameter limitations of conventional extruded dielectric cables has impeded their replacement in existing PILC conduits. This paper describes a study for the evaluation for reliably reducing the insulation thickness to achieve a lower diameter cable to effectively replace PILC cable in existing conduits. Part 1 of the investigation reviews the theory of insulation wall determination and the test program carried out to evaluate electrical performance of reduced wall EPR cables.

Previous studies have shown the cold load condition lasts between 2 and 60 minutes, or longer, depending on the duration of the outage, type of load, and the local weather. The theory presented in this paper is applicable to all microprocessor based overcurrent protective devices used at the distribution level. The example used in the paper is to provide a possible method to handle cold load pickup problems at line reclosers installed on the distribution system. The new approach is to control the pickup of the phase element of the recloser as a function of time. The pickup of the recloser starts at a present value after an extended outage and slowly decreases and returns to the normal pickup in a predetermined manner. The relationship of the pickup level and time could be determined by considering the maximum cold load current and its gradual decay with time.","","","","","","United States","1997-04-01T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: IEEE Transactions on Power Delivery; Journal Volume: 12; Journal Issue: 2; Conference: 1996 Summer meeting of the IEEE Power Engineering Society, Denver, CO (United States), 28 Jul - 1 Aug 1996; Other Information: PBD: Apr 1997","","Medium: X; Size: pp. 660-667","","CONF-960725-","","Journal ID: ITPDE5; ISSN 0885-8977; TRN: IM9730%%60","10.1109/61.584335","","2009-12-16T00:00:00Z","492181","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/492181","","IEEE Transactions on Power Delivery","2","12"

The reliability method is described, along with sample data and results.","","","","","","United States","1997-04-01T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: IEEE Transactions on Power Delivery; Journal Volume: 12; Journal Issue: 2; Conference: IEEE/PES transmission and distribution conference and exposition: a crossroad of technology and change, Los Angeles, CA (United States), 15-20 Sep 1996; Other Information: PBD: Apr 1997","","Medium: X; Size: pp. 675-680","","CONF-9609171-","","Journal ID: ITPDE5; ISSN 0885-8977; TRN: IM9730%%62","10.1109/61.584340","","2009-12-16T00:00:00Z","492183","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/492183","","IEEE Transactions on Power Delivery","2","12"

(CLP) is responsible for supplying electricity to the whole of Hong Kong except Hong Kong Island and Lamma Island. In CLP`s Castle Peak power plant, 19 kV and 23 kV electric supplies are generated. The voltage is then stepped up to 400 kV for transmission. The intermediate control between those transformers and the major 400 kV overhead transmission system lies with a standard One and a half Breaker Configuration switch substations. The substation houses single phase encapsulated SF{sub 6} circuit breakers. In the urban centers, 400 kV substations are installed to step down 400 kV to 132 kV or further to 11 kV for distribution. This paper describes the development of a on-line distributed information system for monitoring the conditions of the whole HV transmission system. The system continuously monitors status of each circuit breaker (CB) together with important operational parameters, such as duration during making and breaking, operations of hydraulic pumps and SF{sub 6} gas pressure etc. Each group of CBs is monitored by a standalone microcontroller using a local area network with a baud rate of 9,600. The information can be recorded on the harddisk of an on-site microcomputer and further transmitted back to a remote computer for alarm generation and multi-station supervision. The CLP 400 kV substation and the Tsz Wan Shan 400 kV substation are among the first targets for development.","","","","","","United States","1997-04-01T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: IEEE Transactions on Power Delivery; Journal Volume: 12; Journal Issue: 2; Conference: IEEE/PES transmission and distribution conference and exposition: a crossroad of technology and change, Los Angeles, CA (United States), 15-20 Sep 1996; Other Information: PBD: Apr 1997","","Medium: X; Size: pp. 707-713","","CONF-9609171-","","Journal ID: ITPDE5; ISSN 0885-8977; TRN: IM9730%%66","10.1109/61.584353","","2009-12-16T00:00:00Z","492187","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/492187","","IEEE Transactions on Power Delivery","2","12"

The objective is to find parameters that both are available from external acoustic measurements and usable for assessing whether a particle has the potential to cause an insulation breakdown. The elapsed time between subsequent particle impacts is a measure of how far into the high-field region the particle can move, and thus also a measure on criticality. Secondly, the amplitude of the acoustic signal generated as a particle impacts the enclosure increases with increasing particle length and thus also with increasing criticality. Moreover, plotting these two parameters against each other (particle flight time vs. signal amplitude at impact) for a significant number of impacts (e.g., 1,000) always yields a very characteristic pattern, which in itself is a strong indication that the recorded signals are generated by one, moving particle.","","","","","","United States","1997-04-01T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: IEEE Transactions on Power Delivery; Journal Volume: 12; Journal Issue: 2; Conference: IEEE/PES transmission and distribution conference and exposition: a crossroad of technology and change, Los Angeles, CA (United States), 15-20 Sep 1996; Other Information: PBD: Apr 1997","","Medium: X; Size: pp. 714-721","","CONF-9609171-","","Journal ID: ITPDE5; ISSN 0885-8977; TRN: IM9730%%67","10.1109/61.584354","","2009-12-16T00:00:00Z","492188","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/492188","","IEEE Transactions on Power Delivery","2","12"

(TEP). SWPP, which markets 40- and 45-foot static cast poles, is a joint-venture with Maquinaria y Equipos Veracruz, S.A. de C.V., a Mexican company that provides poles to that nation`s federal power authority. The co-op estimates it is saving $50 per pole at the time of purchase and will save substantially more as a result of reduced costs in years to come. Labor costs will drop because poles will not need to be replaced. Fewer man hours--and, consequently, fewer kilowatt-hour sales--will be lost as a result of fewer outages, Peck said. Instead of having a wood pole inspection service check the poles annually, Peck said, {open_quotes}We`ll just drive by ourselves and take a look.{close_quotes} Concrete poles are the pole of choice in most of the world, though their first widespread use in the United States did not come until Virginia Electric Power Co. started to use them in 1968, according to a paper presented last summer at the first seminar sponsored by the Electric Power Research Institute to deal exclusively with pole selection.","","","","","","United States","1997-04-01T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: Electric Light and Power; Journal Volume: 75; Journal Issue: 4; Other Information: PBD: Apr 1997","","Medium: X; Size: pp. 18, 20","","","","Journal ID: ELLPAJ; ISSN 0013-4120; TRN: 97:002716-0004","","","2009-12-16T00:00:00Z","468407","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/468407","","Electric Light and Power","4","75"

The first approach employs an extended delta transformer arrangement, which results in near equal leakage inductance in series with each diode rectifier bridge. This promotes equal current sharing and improved performance. A specially tapped interphase transformer is then introduced with two additional diodes to extend the conventional 12-pulse operation to 24-pulse operation from the input current point of view. The proposed system exhibits clean power characteristics with fifth, seventh, eleventh, thirteenth, seventeenth, and nineteenth harmonics eliminated from the utility line currents. The second scheme is a reduced voltampere approach employing autotransformers to obtain 24-pulse operation.

The concept of switching functions has been proposed before to evaluate harmonics produced by a phase-controlled six-pulse converter under both balanced and unbalanced power supply conditions. This paper extends the switching-functions approach to establish analytical equations for the dc output voltage harmonics produced by 12-, 18-, and 24-pulse converters. The problem is approached from the standpoint of symmetrical voltage components. The increase in distortion under unbalance is caused by the appearance of a second harmonic component. A method, based on an asymmetrical firing angle, to cancel the second harmonic at the converter output under unbalanced voltage supply is also presented. Cancellation of the second harmonic improves converter dc output voltage quality.","","","","","","United States","1997-03-01T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: IEEE Transactions on Power Electronics; Journal Volume: 12; Journal Issue: 2; Other Information: PBD: Mar 1997","","Medium: X; Size: pp. 332-342","","","","Journal ID: ITPEE8; ISSN 0885-8993; TRN: IM9729%%158","10.1109/63.558756","","2009-12-16T00:00:00Z","490907","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/490907","","IEEE Transactions on Power Electronics","2","12"

The model can be used under various time-transient conditions and can easily be implemented into a larger system in a circuit simulation package, such as Saber, to study a transformer`s interaction with switching overvoltages, for example.","","","","","","United States","1997-03-01T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: IEEE Transactions on Magnetics; Journal Volume: 33; Journal Issue: 2Pt2; Conference: 1996 Summer meeting of the IEEE Power Engineering Society, Denver, CO (United States), 28 Jul - 1 Aug 1996; Other Information: PBD: Mar 1997","","Medium: X; Size: pp. 1306-1309","","CONF-960725-","","Journal ID: IEMGAQ; ISSN 0018-9464; TRN: IM9719%%108","10.1109/20.582495","","2009-12-16T00:00:00Z","462638","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/462638","","IEEE Transactions on Magnetics","2Pt2","33"

These limitations include (1) the inability to treat the system uncertainty when a stable nominal plant becomes an unstable perturbed plant; (2) the cancellation of the plant`s poorly damped poles by the controller`s zeros. The proposed multiple inputs single output controller for the excitation system is based on the numerator-denominator uncertainty representation which is not restricted in the modeling of uncertainty as compared to the standard additive or multiplicative uncertainty representation. Furthermore, the bilinear transformation has been used in the design to prevent the pole-zero cancellation of the poorly damped poles and to improve the control system performance. Simulation results have shown satisfactory performance of the proposed PSS for a wide range of operating conditions and good stability margin as compared to both the conventional PSS and the standard H{sub {infinity}}-PSS.","","","","","","United States","1997-03-01T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: IEEE Transactions on Energy Conversion; Journal Volume: 12; Journal Issue: 1; Conference: 7. biennial IEEE conference on electromagnetic field computation, Okayama (Japan), 18-21 Mar 1996; Other Information: PBD: Mar 1997","","Medium: X; Size: pp. 45-50","","CONF-9603111-","","Journal ID: ITCNE4; ISSN 0885-8969; TRN: IM9720%%333","10.1109/60.577279","","2009-12-16T00:00:00Z","465118","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/465118","","IEEE Transactions on Energy Conversion","1","12"
"Multiobjective power dispatch with line flow constraints using the fast Newton-Raphson method","Chen, J F; Chen, S D","24 POWER TRANSMISSION AND DISTRIBUTION; POWER DISTRIBUTION SYSTEMS; LOAD ANALYSIS; CALCULATION METHODS; OPTIMIZATION; FUEL SUPPLIES; ENVIRONMENTAL IMPACTS; COMPUTERIZED SIMULATION","The fast Newton-Raphson approach based on an alternative Jacobian matrix is proposed to solve the multiobjective power dispatch (MPD) problem with line flow constraints. Two conflicting objectives including minimization of fuel cost and environmental impact of emission are considered in this study. The Jacobian matrix is formulated by the incremental transmission loss in terms of the sensitivity factors, line flows, and line resistances. The sensitivity factors are obtained from line flow solutions based on a DC load flow model. Moreover, the B-coefficients matrix and the Lagrange function can be shown as convex functions. Therefore, the existence and uniqueness of the solution for the nonlinear equation of the MPD problem can be proven. The proposed approach is tested on the IEEE 14- and 30-bus systems. Simulation results obtained from the proposed method confirm the advantage of computation rapidity and solution accuracy over that of the AC load flow method and the conventional B-coefficients method, respectively. The comparison confirms the capability of the proposed method in real-time implementation for the MPD problem.","","","","National Science Council, Taipei (Taiwan, Province of China)","","United States","1997-03-01T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: IEEE Transactions on Energy Conversion; Journal Volume: 12; Journal Issue: 1; Conference: 7. biennial IEEE conference on electromagnetic field computation, Okayama (Japan), 18-21 Mar 1996; Other Information: PBD: Mar 1997","","Medium: X; Size: pp. 86-93","","CONF-9603111-","","Journal ID: ITCNE4; ISSN 0885-8969; TRN: IM9720%%339","10.1109/60.577285","","2016-05-03T00:00:00Z","465124","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/465124","","IEEE Transactions on Energy Conversion","1","12"

"Photovoltaics support distribution feeder","Barker, P P; Bailey, B; Peterson, Jr, A J","24 POWER TRANSMISSION AND DISTRIBUTION; POWER DISTRIBUTION SYSTEMS; DISPERSED STORAGE AND GENERATION; POWER DISTRIBUTION; PHOTOVOLTAIC POWER SUPPLIES","The concept of supporting the transmission and distribution (T&D) system with a photovoltaic (PV) distributed energy source has gained increasing attention as the cost of PV energy has declined. Locating a PV system at a strategic point on the distribution feeder can enhance the overall T&D system performance and provide a source of renewable power generation. In such applications, the PV system peak output ranges from a few percent up to about 20 percent of the peak feeder load. A good example of one such project on a line supplied by the Pacific Gas & Electric Co.`s Kerman Substation near Fresno, California. Given the success of this and other projects, Niagara Mohawk Power Corp. (NMPC) will be testing a 100 kW ac output system interconnected with a 13.2 kV distribution feeder to demonstrate PV T&D support concepts in its service territory. The demonstration system construction and operation is to be funded by NMPC, Utility Photovoltaics Group (UPVG) and New York State Energy Research and Development Authority (NYSERDA). AWS Scientific will manage the site construction and be responsible for maintaining, operating and monitoring the performance of the system. As a prerequisite to construction of the system, the NMPC research and development department funded AWS Scientific Inc. (Albany, N.Y.) and Power Technologies Inc.

The study involved reviewing a large number of distribution circuits throughout NMPC`s service territory to find candidate locations for the 100 kW demonstration project. A key focus of the study was to find a feeder whereby the injection of PV energy provided maximum dispersed generation benefits.","","","","","","United States","1997-03-01T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: Electric Light and Power; Journal Volume: 75; Journal Issue: 3; Other Information: PBD: Mar 1997","","Medium: X; Size: pp. 20-21","","","","Journal ID: ELLPAJ; ISSN 0013-4120; TRN: 97:001935-0005","","","2009-12-16T00:00:00Z","456722","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/456722","","Electric Light and Power","3","75"
"Coupled conduction-convection problem for an underground rectangular duct containing three insulated cables","Liu, Y; Phan-Thien, N; Kemp, R; Luo, X L","24 POWER TRANSMISSION AND DISTRIBUTION; UNDERGROUND POWER TRANSMISSION; DUCTS; HEAT TRANSFER; ELECTRIC CABLES; POWER TRANSMISSION LINES; NUMERICAL ANALYSIS","The coupled heat conduction-convection problem for three insulating cables resting in a rectangular duct filled with air, which is buried underground, is solved by an operator-splitting pseudo-time-stepping finite element method. The method automatically satisfies the continuity of the interfacial temperature and heat flux. The temperature distribution in the metal cores, in the insulating layers, and in the surrounding air and soil, together with the convective flow pattern, are obtained simultaneously. From the profile of the local Nusselt number, which is strongly dependent on the thermal conductivity ratios and weakly dependent on the Rayleigh number, it is concluded that most of the heat transfer takes place via the bottom of the enclosure through a conductive mode.","","","","USDOE","","United States","1997-03-01T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: Numerical Heat Transfer.

The induced electric fields were calculated with a homogeneous tissue equivalent prolate spheroid. The stimulation level of the field was computed with the SENN model by using a folded axon with 2 mm separation for the Ranvier nodes. In the case of rectangler induced electric field pulses, the asymptotic stimulation level for electric field strength was 10 Vm{sup -1} with pulse durations greater than 100 {mu}s and for integrated electric field strength 1 x 10{sup -3} V m{sup -1} s with pulse durations less than 100 {mu}s. The latter threshold level was exceeded in the surface of the prolate spheroid when the magnetic flux density changed by more than 7.4 mT within 100 {mu}s. For Sinusoidal bursts, the threshold amplitude of the magnetic field decreased asymptotically to a minimum value 2.5 mT when the carrier frequency and burst duration exceeded 5 kHz and 100 {mu}s, respectively. If the same safety criteria are applied for pulsed and continuous exposure, the peak limits for induced current densities and magnetic field can exceed the amplitude values of the limits for continuous exposure only by a factor varying from 3 to 10. 31 refs., 12 figs.","","","","USDOE","","United States","1997-03-01T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: Health Physics; Journal Volume: 72; Journal Issue: 3; Other Information: PBD: Mar 1997","","Medium: X; Size: pp. 408-416","","","","Journal ID: HLTPAO; ISSN 0017-9078; TRN: 97:001939-0005","10.1097/00004032-199703000-00008","","2016-04-25T00:00:00Z","460091","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/460091","","Health Physics","3","72"

Various elements of digital protection systems are identified and organized to generate an systematic approach to modeling the actual hardware of relay systems. Discussion is limited to conventional relaying systems that monitor the vitality of the 60 Hz voltages and/or currents. TACS functions for transport delay and pulse generators are used to model dynamics associated with analog to digital conversion and sampling systems. DSP algorithms convert a sequence of sampled data into a sequence of values for magnitude and phase components.

Generic restoration actions (GRAs) have been identified in previous research based on a variety of restoration strategies used by utilities. This paper proposed a scheduling method using the Petri Net (PN) techniques. The PN model incorporates the conditions that have to be met before an action can be taken. The time required to perform an action is also modeled in the net. A token passing and a backward search processes are used to identify the sequence of restoration actions and their timing. The advantages of the proposed methods are (1) the time required to restore a subsystem can be estimated, (2) a systematical method is obtained for identification of the sequence of actions.

For such estimators, the authors describe an efficient implementation, one that builds naturally on existing least squares software, that is based on an iterative Gauss-Newton solution of the KKT optimality conditions. The authors illustrate the behavior of a quadratic-linear and a quadratic-constant objective function on a set of test networks. The former is closely related to the Huber M-estimator.

In the introduction the authors address three questions about start-ups of hydro power units: What causes the costs in the start-up? How much does a start-up cost? How do start-ups effect the short-term scheduling strategies of power producers in Sweden? In order to answer these questions, they have interviewed employees working with generation planning at the eight largest power producers in Sweden. They found five aspects causing start-up costs: Loss of water during maintenance; wear and tear of the windings due to temperature changes during the start-up; wear and tear of mechanical equipment during the start-up; malfunctions in the control equipment during the start-up; and loss of water during the start-up. The aspects causing the largest costs are maintenance due to the wear and tear and the unavailability and personnel costs due to malfunctions in the control equipment. The cost of lost water is usually small. The authors` conclusions are the following: (1) Start-ups cost. The cost will depend on the nominal power of the unit and the unit model. (2) The majority of the power producers consider start-ups in their planning. (3) There is a need for better knowledge about start-up cost. (4) There is a need for planning software which considers start-up costs of hydro units.","","","","","","United States","1997-02-01T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: IEEE Transactions on Power Systems; Journal Volume: 12; Journal Issue: 1; Conference: IEEE Power Engineering Society (PES) Winter meeting, Baltimore, MD (United States), 21-25 Jan 1996; Other Information: PBD: Feb 1997","","Medium: X; Size: pp. 38-44","","CONF-960111-","","Journal ID: ITPSEG; ISSN 0885-8950; TRN: IM9727%%52","10.1109/59.574921","","2009-12-16T00:00:00Z","484884","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/484884","","IEEE Transactions on Power Systems","1","12"

It is believed that reactive power pricing and management under open-access will depend upon two important developments: (1) the functional unbundling of facilities that support the reactive power and voltage control service, and (2) grid rules to facilitate the coordination between generation and transmission systems for reliable system operation. The paper discusses the characteristics of reactive power that must be considered in order to develop a framework for reactive power pricing and management. Several cost allocation methods for valuing reactive power are presented. Two workable reactive power pricing structures are also proposed.

The analysis of IEEE-RTS is also included for a number of studies representing the various operating design characteristics.","","","","","","United States","1997-02-01T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: IEEE Transactions on Power Systems; Journal Volume: 12; Journal Issue: 1; Conference: IEEE Power Engineering Society (PES) Winter meeting, Baltimore, MD (United States), 21-25 Jan 1996; Other Information: PBD: Feb 1997","","Medium: X; Size: pp. 464-470","","CONF-960111-","","Journal ID: ITPSEG; ISSN 0885-8950; TRN: IM9727%%103","10.1109/59.575785","","2009-12-16T00:00:00Z","484935","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/484935","","IEEE Transactions on Power Systems","1","12"
"The effects of voltage collapse problems in the reliability evaluation of composite systems","Melo, A C.G.; Mello, J C.O.; Granville, S","24 POWER TRANSMISSION AND DISTRIBUTION; POWER SYSTEMS; STABILITY; VOLTAGE DROP; RELIABILITY; CALCULATION METHODS","This paper describes an approach to calculate voltage collapse related bulk reliability indices as well as their impact on the adequacy reliability indices. In this approach, the adequacy analysis of each selected system state is carried out in two steps. In the first one, it is computed the minimum load shedding to restore system solvability, neglecting operational constraints such as bus voltage levels and circuit power flows. In the second one, it is calculated the additional minimum load curtailment to alleviate any operating limit violations. In each step, an optimal power flow is solved by a direct interior point algorithm, and related reliability indices are evaluated. The proposed methodology can be used in both enumeration and Monte Carlo methods. Case studies with a practical 11-bus network (the Brazilian Reduced Mato Grosso system) and with a 1,600-bus network derived from the Brazilian South/Southeast/Central West system are presented and discussed.","","","","","","United States","1997-02-01T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: IEEE Transactions on Power Systems; Journal Volume: 12; Journal Issue: 1; Conference: IEEE Power Engineering Society (PES) Winter meeting, Baltimore, MD (United States), 21-25 Jan 1996; Other Information: PBD: Feb 1997","","Medium: X; Size: pp. 480-488","","CONF-960111-","","Journal ID: ITPSEG; ISSN 0885-8950; TRN: IM9727%%105","","","2009-12-16T00:00:00Z","484937","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/484937","","IEEE Transactions on Power Systems","1","12"

Derived herein are optimal real-time prices for both real and reactive power. The optimal prices are temporally and spatially differentiated. The prices derived include additive premia, or opportunity costs, reflecting the effects of voltage regulation, maintenance of generation and transmission reserves, regulation of frequency and tie-line flows, removal and/or control of power harmonics, and others.

The costs of operating, maintaining and expanding the transmission system, that is pricing transmission services, needs to be addressed. This has to be done on an economically rational and technically meaningful basis and this paper suggests an approach which distinguishes between operating and embedded costs and develops separate methods in respect of each of these components. Capacity use as well as reliability benefits derived by different users are taken into account in the disbursement of charges for investment recovery.

"Cost-effectiveness of emission control at fossil-fuel units for different cumulative load patterns","Roy, S","24 POWER TRANSMISSION AND DISTRIBUTION; 20 FOSSIL-FUELED POWER PLANTS; POWER SYSTEMS; FOSSIL-FUEL POWER PLANTS; AIR POLLUTION CONTROL; POWER GENERATION; OPERATION; ECONOMICS","This paper describes a method to recommend allocation of generating units, with a view to achieve cost-effective control of particulate and gaseous emissions over an energy scenario. Definition of relative cost and relative emission, with respect to corresponding base-case values, allows one to develop a model that describes cost and emission aspects of the chosen scenario. Optimization of this model, by any appropriate linear-programming software, yields the allocation levels to be recommended. The emphasis of this paper is on the way in which results of the said optimization model reflect the effect of demand patterns on the allocation levels. Depending on the demands, required generation levels from each individual unit may differ. This affects the overall generation cost, and simultaneously the emissions from the thermal units, both relative to respective base values. Since the optimization algorithm attempts to reduce both the relative quantities, its results always reflect the changing generation vs. emission tradeoff for utilities vis-a-vis different demand patterns.","","","","","","United States","1997-02-01T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: IEEE Transactions on Power Systems; Journal Volume: 12; Journal Issue: 1; Conference: IEEE Power Engineering Society (PES) Winter meeting, Baltimore, MD (United States), 21-25 Jan 1996; Other Information: PBD: Feb 1997","","Medium: X; Size: pp. 321-328","","CONF-960111-","","Journal ID: ITPSEG; ISSN 0885-8950; TRN: IM9727%%84","10.1109/59.574954","","2009-12-16T00:00:00Z","484916","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/484916","","IEEE Transactions on Power Systems","1","12"

The authors build sagittal diagrams which represent the fuzzy relations for power systems, and diagnose fault sections using the sagittal diagrams. Next, they examine the malfunction or wrong alarm of relays and circuit breakers based on the alarm information and the estimated fault section. The proposed system provides the fault section candidates in terms of the degree of membership and the malfunction or wrong alarm. An operator monitors these candidates and is able to diagnose the fault section, coping with uncertainties. Experimental studies for real power systems reveal usefulness of the proposed technique to diagnose faults that have uncertainty.","","","","","","United States","1997-02-01T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: IEEE Transactions on Power Systems; Journal Volume: 12; Journal Issue: 1; Conference: IEEE Power Engineering Society (PES) Winter meeting, Baltimore, MD (United States), 21-25 Jan 1996; Other Information: PBD: Feb 1997","","Medium: X; Size: pp. 342-348","","CONF-960111-","","Journal ID: ITPSEG; ISSN 0885-8950; TRN: IM9727%%87","","","2009-12-16T00:00:00Z","484919","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/484919","","IEEE Transactions on Power Systems","1","12"

Use of these measurements may lead to multiple solutions and therefore to the loss of unique observability for certain measurement configurations. The paper proposes a simple method based on the commonly used measurement residual covariance matrix, in order to detect the possibility of multiple solutions for a given measurement set. The proposed test is simple to implement and uses the already available matrices and data structures of the commonly used weighted least squares state estimation programs. It can be utilized as a planning tool during the initial stages of measurement system design as well as an online observability analysis tool to enhance the capability of the existing observability programs which can not properly process the current magnitude measurements.

Here the authors concentrate on and give results only for one day ahead forecasts although the method is also applicable for 7--10 days ahead. A forecasting model has been developed which identifies a normal or weather-insensitive load component and a weather-sensitive load component. Linear regression analysis of past load and weather data is used to identify the normal load model. The weather-sensitive component of the load is estimated using the parameters of the regression analysis. Certain design features of the short-term load forecasting system are important for its successful operation over time. These include adaptability to changing operational conditions, computational economy and robustness. An automated load forecasting system is presented here that includes these design features. A fully automated algorithm for updating the model is described in detail as are the techniques employed in both the identification and treatment of influential points in the data base and the selection of predictors for the weather-load model. Monthly error statistics of forecast load for only one day ahead are presented for recorded weather conditions.","","","","","","United States","1997-02-01T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: IEEE Transactions on Power Systems; Journal Volume: 12; Journal Issue: 1; Conference: IEEE Power Engineering Society (PES) Winter meeting, Baltimore, MD (United States), 21-25 Jan 1996; Other Information: PBD: Feb 1997","","Medium: X; Size: pp. 84-94","","CONF-960111-","","Journal ID: ITPSEG; ISSN 0885-8950; TRN: IM9727%%58","10.1109/59.574927","","2009-12-16T00:00:00Z","484890","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/484890","","IEEE Transactions on Power Systems","1","12"

With this formulation, the conventional steps of forming the Jacobian matrix, LU factorization and forward/back substitution are replaced by back/forward sweeps on radial feeders with equivalent impedances. Tests on several large distribution systems ranged from 490 to 1651 in nodes, 0.15 to 5.48 in r/x ratio and 0.0004 {Omega} to 3.07 {Omega} in line impedance have shown that the proposed method is as robust and efficient as the back/forward sweep method.

More strictly, the obtainable points by the method are the stationary points including not only CLL but also farthest and saddle points. An operating solution and a low voltage load flow solution are used to efficiently estimate the node injections at a CLL as well as the left and right eigenvectors corresponding to the zero eigenvalue of the load flow Jacobian. They can be used in monitoring loadability margin, in identification of weak spots in a power system and in the examination of an optimal control against voltage collapse. Most of the computation time of the proposed method is taken in calculating the load flow solution pair. The remaining computation time is less than that of an ordinary load flow.","","","","","","United States","1997-02-01T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: IEEE Transactions on Power Systems; Journal Volume: 12; Journal Issue: 1; Conference: IEEE Power Engineering Society (PES) Winter meeting, Baltimore, MD (United States), 21-25 Jan 1996; Other Information: PBD: Feb 1997","","Medium: X; Size: pp. 424-429","","CONF-960111-","","Journal ID: ITPSEG; ISSN 0885-8950; TRN: IM9727%%98","10.1109/59.575754","","2009-12-16T00:00:00Z","484930","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/484930","","IEEE Transactions on Power Systems","1","12"
"Distribution circuit state estimation using a probabilistic approach","Ghosh, A K; Lubkeman, D L; Downey, M J; Jones, R H","24 POWER TRANSMISSION AND DISTRIBUTION; POWER DISTRIBUTION SYSTEMS; POWER TRANSMISSION; ON-LINE CONTROL SYSTEMS; AUTOMATION; LOAD ANALYSIS; POWER DEMAND","Past work on distribution circuit state estimation has focused on the adoption of a transmission state estimator approach, without necessarily accounting for the specific requirements of a distribution circuit-based analysis. On distribution circuits, typically, there are very few available real-time measurements, and thus, researchers have treated customer load demand estimates as pseudo-measurements in a weighted-least-squares formulation. This can lead to convergence problems, and also, the approach effectively assumes that all bus load demands are normally distributed (gaussian) which may not be valid on distribution circuits. This paper presents an alternative approach to distribution circuit state estimation using a probabilistic extension of the radial load flow algorithm while accounting for real-time measurements as solution constraints. The algorithm which takes advantage of the radial nature of distribution circuits also accounts for other issues specific to distribution circuits. Namely, the algorithm accounts for non-normally distributed loads, incorporates the concept of load diversity (load correlation) and can interact with a load allocation routine. The effectiveness of the algorithm is illustrated through comparisons made with Monte Carlo simulations.","","","","Empire State Electric Energy Research Corp., New York, NY (United States)","","United States","1997-02-01T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: IEEE Transactions on Power Systems; Journal Volume: 12; Journal Issue: 1; Conference: IEEE Power Engineering Society (PES) Winter meeting, Baltimore, MD (United States), 21-25 Jan 1996; Other Information: PBD: Feb 1997","","Medium: X; Size: pp. 45-51","","CONF-960111-","","Journal ID: ITPSEG; ISSN 0885-8950; TRN: IM9727%%53","10.1109/59.574922","","2009-12-16T00:00:00Z","484885","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/484885","","IEEE Transactions on Power Systems","1","12"

The lack of uniformity in usage and definition has also been a source of challenge to developers/users in OPF. The increasing need for OPF to solve problems of today`s deregulated industry, and the unsolved problems in the vertically integrated industry has caused the working group on operating economics, through task force, challenges to OPF to evaluate the capabilities of existing OPF, in terms of their abilities. OPF has enjoyed the renewed interest in a variety of formulations, though the use of advanced optimized techniques such as, Genetic Algorithms, Interior Point methods, simulated annealing method, decomposition and Newton`s method, and their contributions have been significant. Several production grade software suits with a family of applications have been in the market place and various industry and research archives. In spite of all the investment and work to date on OPF, several questions regarding what challenges are before OPF remain to be answered. Summaries of the presentations at the panel are presented herein to provide a working reference to needs and interest in OPF technology.","","","","","","United States","1997-02-01T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: IEEE Transactions on Power Systems; Journal Volume: 12; Journal Issue: 1; Conference: IEEE Power Engineering Society (PES) Winter meeting, Baltimore, MD (United States), 21-25 Jan 1996; Other Information: PBD: Feb 1997","","Medium: X; Size: pp. 444-455","","CONF-960111-","","Journal ID: ITPSEG; ISSN 0885-8950; TRN: IM9727%%101","10.1109/59.575768","","2009-12-16T00:00:00Z","484933","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/484933","","IEEE Transactions on Power Systems","1","12"

A polynomial approximation with respect to time is applied to the wave form of the transients in estimating the inertia constant, and a simple model based on the idea of average system frequency is assumed in estimating the capacity of the generators. Results of the estimation using the transients at 10 events show that the inertia constant of the 60Hz power system of Japan is around 14 to 18 seconds in the system load base, and the capacity of the spinning-reserve support generators is 20 to 40% of the system load.

The size of this matrix can be as large as ten times the number of buses in the system. Comparisons of the two IP implementations with large scale power systems with as many as 4,000 buses are presented.

"On-line economic load dispatch based on fuel cost dynamics","Yoshikawa, M; Toshida, N; Nakajima, H; Harada, Y; Tsurugai, M; Nakata, Y","24 POWER TRANSMISSION AND DISTRIBUTION; POWER SYSTEMS; ENERGY EXPENSES; LOAD MANAGEMENT; LOAD ANALYSIS; ECONOMICS; PLANNING; OPERATION; MATHEMATICAL MODELS","To reduce boiler fuel cost, a fuel cost model, which is more accurate than a conventional one, is developed and this model is applied to economic load dispatch (ELD). The purpose of ELD is to determine power demands of individual generators so that total fuel cost of those generators may be minimized. Here, in evaluating the fuel cost of each generator, an approximate model, which describes the fuel cost as a function of the generation, is used. Therefore, the accuracy of the model has a great influence on the preciseness of the minimization. So far, one of the most prevailing model has been a quadratic model, which describes the fuel cost as a quadratic function of the generation. However, this model being contrasted with actual data, it is noticed that the model often deviates from the actual data, especially during the time while the generation is dynamically varying. This fact implies that, if a model, which is accurate even when the generation dynamically varies, is developed and the model is applied to ELD, the total fuel cost can be reduced. First, taking into account that the deviation might be due to the dynamics of the automatic boiler controller (ABC), the authors employed as a supplementary model the autoregressive moving average (ARMA) model, which is capable of describing dynamics and is suitable for an on-line ELD calculation. Second, ELD problem based on the ARMA-model-supplemented quadratic model is formulated as a quadratic programming (QP) problem, which can be solved by the standard QP method. Finally, the cost reduction effect is evaluated by computer simulations on Kansai electric Power System.","","","","","","United States","1997-02-01T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: IEEE Transactions on Power Systems; Journal Volume: 12; Journal Issue: 1; Conference: IEEE Power Engineering Society (PES) Winter meeting, Baltimore, MD (United States), 21-25 Jan 1996; Other Information: PBD: Feb 1997","","Medium: X; Size: pp. 315-320","","CONF-960111-","","Journal ID: ITPSEG; ISSN 0885-8950; TRN: IM9727%%83","10.1109/59.574953","","2009-12-16T00:00:00Z","484915","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/484915","","IEEE Transactions on Power Systems","1","12"

The method is general in the sense that it does not assume any particular property of the problem being solved, such as linearity or convexity. Moreover, it has the ability to provide solutions arbitrarily close to an optimum (i.e., it is asymptotically convergent) as the cooling process slows down. The drawback of the approach is the computational burden: finding optimal solutions may be extremely expensive in some cases. This paper presents a Parallel Simulated Annealing, PSA, algorithm for solving the long term transmission network expansion planning problem. A strategy that does not affect the basic convergence properties of the Sequential Simulated Annealing algorithm have been implemented and tested. The paper investigates the conditions under which the parallel algorithm is most efficient. The parallel implementations have been tested on three example networks: a small 6-bus network, and two complex real-life networks. Excellent results are reported in the test section of the paper: in addition to reductions in computing times, the Parallel Simulated Annealing algorithm proposed in the paper has shown significant improvements in solution quality for the largest of the test networks.","","","","","","United States","1997-02-01T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: IEEE Transactions on Power Systems; Journal Volume: 12; Journal Issue: 1; Conference: IEEE Power Engineering Society (PES) Winter meeting, Baltimore, MD (United States), 21-25 Jan 1996; Other Information: PBD: Feb 1997","","Medium: X; Size: pp. 181-188","","CONF-960111-","","Journal ID: ITPSEG; ISSN 0885-8950; TRN: IM9727%%69","10.1109/59.574938","","2009-12-16T00:00:00Z","484901","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/484901","","IEEE Transactions on Power Systems","1","12"

This paper describes a technique for answering these questions which is not limited to incremental changes and which is applicable to both active and reactive power. Starting from a power flow solution, the technique first identifies the busses which are reached by power produced by each generator. Then it determines the sets of busses supplied by the same generators. Using a proportionality assumption, it is then possible to calculate the contribution of each generator to the loads and flows. The applicability of the proposed technique is demonstrated using a 30-bus example.","","","","","","United States","1997-02-01T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: IEEE Transactions on Power Systems; Journal Volume: 12; Journal Issue: 1; Conference: IEEE Power Engineering Society (PES) Winter meeting, Baltimore, MD (United States), 21-25 Jan 1996; Other Information: PBD: Feb 1997","","Medium: X; Size: pp. 52-60","","CONF-960111-","","Journal ID: ITPSEG; ISSN 0885-8950; TRN: IM9727%%54","10.1109/59.574923","","2009-12-16T00:00:00Z","484886","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/484886","","IEEE Transactions on Power Systems","1","12"

Some attractive features of the method are: the parameters of all controllers are jointly determined, there is no restrictions on the type of supplementary signals to be used, and controller structures are compatible with those nowadays employed in electric utilities. The control problem solution exploits sparsity, combining a system description which preserves a sparse structure with an adequate mathematical formulation of the optimal design approach. The resulting method is thus made applicable to large power systems. Results for two test systems, including a large 750-bus system, are presented. For both systems, settings for several power system stabilizers are simultaneously determined. The results are validated by using both eigenvalue analysis and nonlinear simulation.","","","","Fundacao Coordenacao de Aperfeicoamento de Pessoal de Nivel Superior (CAPES) (Brazil)","","United States","1997-02-01T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: IEEE Transactions on Power Systems; Journal Volume: 12; Journal Issue: 1; Conference: IEEE Power Engineering Society (PES) Winter meeting, Baltimore, MD (United States), 21-25 Jan 1996; Other Information: PBD: Feb 1997","","Medium: X; Size: pp. 144-152","","CONF-960111-","","Journal ID: ITPSEG; ISSN 0885-8950; TRN: IM9727%%65","10.1109/59.574934","","2009-12-16T00:00:00Z","484897","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/484897","","IEEE Transactions on Power Systems","1","12"
"A new unit commitment method","Li, C; Johnson, R B; Svoboda, A J","24 POWER TRANSMISSION AND DISTRIBUTION; 29 ENERGY PLANNING AND POLICY; POWER SYSTEMS; OPERATION; CAPACITY; POWER GENERATION; POWER TRANSMISSION","This paper introduces a new unit commitment method based on a decommitment procedure for solving the power system resource scheduling problem. From an initial schedule of all available units committed over the study period, a one-at-a-time unit decommitment is accomplished by Dynamic Programming according to some specified economic criteria. The decommitment process continues until no further reduction in total cost is possible, or the unit schedules of two consecutive iterations over the time period remain unchanged without any violation of the spinning reserve constraint. Two criteria for decommitting a unit are introduced and described in detail. Comparisons of the proposed unit commitment method with the Lagrangian Relaxation (LR) approach and Fred Lee`s Sequential Unit Commitment method (SUC) demonstrate the potential benefits of the proposed approach for power system operations planning.","","","","","","United States","1997-02-01T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: IEEE Transactions on Power Systems; Journal Volume: 12; Journal Issue: 1; Conference: IEEE Power Engineering Society (PES) Winter meeting, Baltimore, MD (United States), 21-25 Jan 1996; Other Information: PBD: Feb 1997","","Medium: X; Size: pp. 113-119","","CONF-960111-","","Journal ID: ITPSEG; ISSN 0885-8950; TRN: IM9727%%61","","","2009-12-16T00:00:00Z","484893","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/484893","","IEEE Transactions on Power Systems","1","12"
"Development of static and simulation programs for voltage stability studies of bulk power system","Nagao, T; Tanaka, K; Takenaka, K","24 POWER TRANSMISSION AND DISTRIBUTION; POWER SYSTEMS; STABILITY; COMPUTER CALCULATIONS; POWER TRANSMISSION; COMPUTERIZED SIMULATION","In the analysis and evaluation of voltage stability, it is necessary to accurately identify the stability margin at each load point under specific system configuration or power balance condition. Voltage stability margin can be basically identified by the multi-solution load flow calculation method. When predicted by this static analysis that voltage instability may occur, time domain simulation will be required which includes the models of various control equipments related with system voltage profile. To deal with this, the following two analytical computer codes shown below were developed. (1) Voltage stability static analysis computer code employing a new load flow calculation method. (2) Time domain long term simulation computer code for voltage stability. These computer codes can also calculate the voltage stability index at each load point which is based on the margin to the stability power limit at each load point. The practicality of these codes developed were verified by applying to the IEEE-118 test system.","","","","","","United States","1997-02-01T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: IEEE Transactions on Power Systems; Journal Volume: 12; Journal Issue: 1; Conference: IEEE Power Engineering Society (PES) Winter meeting, Baltimore, MD (United States), 21-25 Jan 1996; Other Information: PBD: Feb 1997","","Medium: X; Size: pp. 273-281","","CONF-960111-","","Journal ID: ITPSEG; ISSN 0885-8950; TRN: IM9727%%79","10.1109/59.574948","","2009-12-16T00:00:00Z","484911","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/484911","","IEEE Transactions on Power Systems","1","12"

The paper deals with the modelling of a load consisting of a static load plus an aggregate of induction motors. The behavior of three simplified models for such a load configuration is compared. The three models are (A) a generic non-linear dynamic model of the first order as proposed by Karlsson and Hill, (B) A static exponential load plus a dynamic first-order model for the induction motors, (C) a static exponential load plus a dynamic third-order model for the induction motors. A power system with a longitudinal structure is chosen as the case-study. It is shown that for the same perturbation (tripping of one of two high-voltage parallel lines) the simulation results are quite different from each other and, in certain cases, only the third-order dynamic model correctly predicts the voltage collapse phenomena at the load bus. An interpretation of the different behavior of the various models is given.","","","","","","United States","1997-02-01T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: IEEE Transactions on Power Systems; Journal Volume: 12; Journal Issue: 1; Conference: IEEE Power Engineering Society (PES) Winter meeting, Baltimore, MD (United States), 21-25 Jan 1996; Other Information: PBD: Feb 1997","","Medium: X; Size: pp. 293-303","","CONF-960111-","","Journal ID: ITPSEG; ISSN 0885-8950; TRN: IM9727%%81","10.1109/59.574950","","2009-12-16T00:00:00Z","484913","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/484913","","IEEE Transactions on Power Systems","1","12"

To find the switching line, the authors apply the slow coherency transformation to the full system and project a slow subsystem trajectory found from the trajectory reversing method onto the predominant interarea mode. The method is illustrated by the time simulation of a six-machine power system with two interarea modes and is shown to give the desired result.","","","","National Science Foundation, Washington, DC (United States)","","United States","1997-02-01T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: IEEE Transactions on Power Systems; Journal Volume: 12; Journal Issue: 1; Conference: IEEE Power Engineering Society (PES) Winter meeting, Baltimore, MD (United States), 21-25 Jan 1996; Other Information: PBD: Feb 1997","","Medium: X; Size: pp. 215-221","","CONF-960111-","","Journal ID: ITPSEG; ISSN 0885-8950; TRN: IM9727%%73","10.1109/59.574942","","2009-12-16T00:00:00Z","484905","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/484905","","IEEE Transactions on Power Systems","1","12"

"SOHO studies solar activity","Cowen, R C","24 POWER TRANSMISSION AND DISTRIBUTION; SOLAR ACTIVITY; POWER SYSTEMS; SOLAR FLARES; RESEARCH PROGRAMS; MAGNETIC FIELDS; INDUCTION","For solar scientists, the new sun-studying Solar and Heliospheric Observatory (SOHO) satellite is an eye-opener. Its view, undistorted by Earth`s atmosphere, has revealed a previously unknown kind of solar eruption that directly affects the planet. The eruptions are produced when a magnetic trap circling the sun`s equator collects electrically charged particles. This trap forms a magnetic inner tube of these particles around sun that fills and eventually bursts. Then, unlike the well-known flares that eject narrow jets, this outburst becomes a global event because it shoots out highly energetic particles in all directions. While this discovery is important for scientists, it is equally important for everyone on Earth who depends on electric power lines or electronic communications. Streams of energetic solar particles laced with magnetic field lines can damage satellites. They interact with Earth`s magnetic field in ways that disrupt radio communications and power lines. That`s why the United States and some other nations run solar-flare forecasting services. This article reports briefly on current investigations.","","","","USDOE","","United States","1997-02-01T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: IEEE Power Engineering Review; Journal Volume: 17; Journal Issue: 2; Other Information: PBD: Feb 1997","","Medium: X; Size: pp. 9","","","","Journal ID: IPERDV; ISSN 0272-1724; TRN: IM9725%%183","10.1109/MPER.1997.566437","","2016-05-12T00:00:00Z","479421","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/479421","","IEEE Power Engineering Review","2","17"

As demand for electricity increases and the construction of new transmission lines becomes more difficult and expensive, electric utilities are relying on their existing transmission systems more heavily than ever. In recent years, the skyrocketing number of independent power producers--which also use utilities` lines-- and power transfers between utilities have taxed available transmission-line capacity even further.As a power system is loaded more heavily, it becomes more complicated to operate due to the large number of power transfers from multiple sources. As a result, it often operates below its rated capacity; otherwise, reliability would be jeopardized. Heavily loaded systems can have other inherent reliability problems because large power transfers lead to voltage sags. If sags get too extreme, a phenomenon called voltage collapse occurs, and the entire grid can go down.","","","","","","United States","1997-02-01T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: Mechanical Engineering; Journal Volume: 119; Journal Issue: 2; Other Information: PBD: Feb 1997","","Medium: X; Size: pp. 78-79","","","","Journal ID: MEENAH; ISSN 0025-6501; TRN: IM9712%%88","","","2009-12-16T00:00:00Z","442663","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/442663","","Mechanical Engineering","2","119"

A key element in that development is optimizing the specific geometry of both the Silicon-Film{trademark} sheet and the resulting solar cell. That decision has been influenced by cost factors, engineering concerns, and marketing issues. The geometry investigation has focused first on sheet nominally 15 cm wide. This sheet generated solar cells with areas of 240cm{sup 2} and 675cm{sup 2}. Most recently a new sheet fabrication machine was constructed that produces Silicon-Film{trademark} with a width in excess of 30 cm. The results of testing have indicated that there is no limit to the width of sheet generated by this process. The new wide material has led to prototype solar cells with areas of 300, 400 and 1800cm{sup 2}. Test results are available on some sizes, with all results expected later this year.

Analytical expressions were derived for calculating the gains and time constants of the current and voltage regulators. The mathematical model was used to control a 140-kW regenerative VSC. The synchronous reference frame model was used to define feedforward signals in the current regulators to eliminate the cross coupling between the d and q phases. It allowed the reduction of the current control loop to first-order plants and improved their tracking capability. The bandwidths of the current and voltage-control loops were found to be approximately 20 and 60 times (respectively) smaller than the sampling frequency.

"General-purpose fuzzy controller for dc-dc converters","Mattavelli, P; Rossetto, L; Spiazzi, G; Tenti, P","24 POWER TRANSMISSION AND DISTRIBUTION; COMPUTERIZED CONTROL SYSTEMS; DC TO DC CONVERTERS; FUZZY LOGIC; MATHEMATICAL MODELS; CONTROL THEORY","In this paper, a general-purpose fuzzy controller for dc-dc converters is investigated. Based on a qualitative description of the system to be controlled, fuzzy controllers are capable of good performances, even for those systems where linear control techniques fail, e.g., when a mathematical description is not available or is in the presence of wide parameter variations. The presented approach is general and can be applied to any dc-dc converter topologies. Controller implementation is relatively simple and can guarantee a small-signal response as fast and stable as other standard regulators and an improved large-signal response. Simulation results of Buck-Boost and Sepic converters show control potentialities.","","","","","","United States","1997-01-01T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: IEEE Transactions on Power Electronics; Journal Volume: 12; Journal Issue: 1; Other Information: PBD: Jan 1997","","Medium: X; Size: pp. 79-86","","","","Journal ID: ITPEE8; ISSN 0885-8993; TRN: IM9728%%84","10.1109/63.554172","","2009-12-16T00:00:00Z","488893","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/488893","","IEEE Transactions on Power Electronics","1","12"
"Operation of a voltage source converter at increased utility voltage","Kaura, V; Blasko, V","24 POWER TRANSMISSION AND DISTRIBUTION; POWER SUPPLIES; RECTIFIERS; OVERVOLTAGE; OPERATION; POWER FACTOR","The operation of a voltage source converter (VSC) with regeneration capability, controllable power factor, and low distortion of utility currents is analyzed at increased utility voltage. Increase in the utility voltage causes a VSC to saturate and enter a nonlinear mode of operation. To operate under elevated utility, two steps are taken: (1) a pulse width modulation (PWM) algorithm is implemented which extends the linear region of operation by 15% and (2) a PWM saturation regulator is used to control the reactive current at higher utility voltages. The PWM algorithm reduces the switching losses by at least 33% and the effect of blanking time by one-third. All analytical results are experimentally verified on a 100 kW three-phase VSC.","","","","","","United States","1997-01-01T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: IEEE Transactions on Power Electronics; Journal Volume: 12; Journal Issue: 1; Other Information: PBD: Jan 1997","","Medium: X; Size: pp. 132-137","","","","Journal ID: ITPEE8; ISSN 0885-8993; TRN: IM9728%%89","10.1109/63.554178","","2009-12-16T00:00:00Z","488898","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/488898","","IEEE Transactions on Power Electronics","1","12"
"A soft-switched, high-frequency resonant rectifier and characteristics of the controlled system","Choi, H C; Youn, M J","24 POWER TRANSMISSION AND DISTRIBUTION; RECTIFIERS; ELECTRIC POWER; QUALITY CONTROL; HARMONICS; POWER SUPPLIES","In this paper, a high frequency and soft-switched ac/dc rectifier employing a series-type resonant circuit is proposed to obtain the sinusoidal ac line current. Using the proposed rectifier, the high power factor and low harmonic currents are obtained in the ac line. Furthermore, several advantages such as the high power density and wide output voltage range can also be available. To regulate the output voltage of the proposed circuit, the digital proportional-integral (PI) controller is used whose sampling time corresponds to the zero-crossing point of the ac line voltage. Including this controller, the model for the closed-loop system is developed in order to examine the stability and dynamic characteristics. With this model, the gain of the PI controller is determined by the pole assignment technique and the closed-loop dynamics is investigated by the root locus plots. A good agreement is made between the simulated and experimental results.","","","","","","United States","1997-01-01T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: IEEE Transactions on Power Electronics; Journal Volume: 12; Journal Issue: 1; Other Information: PBD: Jan 1997","","Medium: X; Size: pp. 161-172","","","","Journal ID: ITPEE8; ISSN 0885-8993; TRN: IM9728%%92","10.1109/63.554182","","2016-04-08T00:00:00Z","488901","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/488901","","IEEE Transactions on Power Electronics","1","12"
"A new low-cost, fully fault-protected PWM-VSI inverter with true phase-current information","Blaabjerg, F; Pedersen, J K","24 POWER TRANSMISSION AND DISTRIBUTION; INVERTERS; EQUIPMENT PROTECTION DEVICES; ELECTRICAL FAULTS; DESIGN; COMPUTERIZED CONTROL SYSTEMS","This paper proposes a new topology for a low-cost three-phase pulse width modulation (PWM) VSI inverter where a true phase current information exists with the use of only one current sensor in the dc link. The topology also has the benefits of full protection of the inverter such as short circuits in the dc link, output phase faults, and output earth faults. Previously suggested methods have problems at low speed in detecting the phase current, but by the use of space vector modulation in a double-sided implementation, the PWM-pulses are adjusted so true information about the phase current exists even at very low speed. The dc link current is sampled twice during one switching period, and it is proposed to sample in the center of the PWM-pulses to obtain a real average phase current. The effects of blanking-time and overmodulation are also discussed. The strategy is implemented in a 16-b microcontroller, and the test results show the technique is useful in the whole speed range. It is concluded by the use of the proposed topology that only one current sensor will be necessary in the future for PWM-VSI inverters.","","","","","","United States","1997-01-01T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: IEEE Transactions on Power Electronics; Journal Volume: 12; Journal Issue: 1; Other Information: PBD: Jan 1997","","Medium: X; Size: pp. 187-196","","","","Journal ID: ITPEE8; ISSN 0885-8993; TRN: IM9728%%94","10.1109/63.554185","","2009-12-16T00:00:00Z","488903","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/488903","","IEEE Transactions on Power Electronics","1","12"

The basic concept is to find the optimal control voltage for tracking the reference current with minimum time under the voltage limit constraint. Though this minimum time control concept is also applicable to all the machine drive systems, this paper focuses on the current regulation in the three-phase pulse width modulation (PWM) converter. In the simulation and experimental results, it is observed that the proposed controller has much less transient time than the conventional synchronous PI regulator and the performance of the dc link voltage control is also greatly improved with the proposed current controller.","","","","","","United States","1997-01-01T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: IEEE Transactions on Power Electronics; Journal Volume: 12; Journal Issue: 1; Other Information: PBD: Jan 1997","","Medium: X; Size: pp. 124-131","","","","Journal ID: ITPEE8; ISSN 0885-8993; TRN: IM9728%%88","","","2009-12-16T00:00:00Z","488897","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/488897","","IEEE Transactions on Power Electronics","1","12"

Line-commutated thyristor structures have been proposed to replace tap changers, but problems related to filter requirements or the number of switches have limited their utilization. This paper proposes a pulse width modulation (PWM) quadrature-booster phase shifter based on a force-commutated ac controller. It offers features such as fast dynamic response, continuous variation of the phase angle with low harmonic injection, and it requires a simple power structure and can be controlled by adjusting the duty cycle of the switches. The operating principles of the proposed phase shifter are analyzed and their feasibility is demonstrated through digital simulation and experimental implementation.","","","","","","United States","1997-01-01T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: IEEE Transactions on Power Electronics; Journal Volume: 12; Journal Issue: 1; Other Information: PBD: Jan 1997","","Medium: X; Size: pp. 138-144","","","","Journal ID: ITPEE8; ISSN 0885-8993; TRN: IM9728%%90","10.1109/63.554179","","2009-12-16T00:00:00Z","488899","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/488899","","IEEE Transactions on Power Electronics","1","12"

This trend has been driven by the increased use of power electronic switching devices in transmission and industrial power systems and electric arcing devices in industrial applications. Electric utilities supplying power to these systems have become increasingly sensitive about harmonics emanating from these loads. This has resulted in increasingly complex filter designs with multiple branches tuned at different frequencies in order to achieve a harmonic distortion level that will meet standardized requirements. This paper focuses on the switching surge duties imposed on capacitors and air-cored reactors which are used in single tuned filters at arc furnace installations. Switching surge studies are often necessary to fully rate these components. Rating guidelines are provided. An example compares conventional filter designs with designs in which switching surges are considered.","","","","","","United States","1997-01-01T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: IEEE Transactions on Industry Applications; Journal Volume: 33; Journal Issue: 1; Other Information: DN: Presented at the 1995 Industry Applications Society annual meeting, Lake Buena Vista, FL (US), October 8--12; PBD: Jan-Feb 1997","","Medium: X; Size: pp. 226-233","","","","Journal ID: ITIACR; ISSN 0093-9994; TRN: IM9725%%168","10.1109/28.567118","","2009-12-16T00:00:00Z","479406","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/479406","","IEEE Transactions on Industry Applications","1","33"

Five islands formed with controlled and uncontrolled load shedding, uncontrolled generation tripping, and with a blackout in southern Idaho. The western power system is operated by power companies belonging to the Western Systems Coordinating Council (WSCC), which had a peak 1996 summer load of around 118,000 MW. July 2 was the third and, until the August 10 large-scale power failure, the most disruptive of a series of western system breakups. The first was caused by the January 17, 1994, Northridge California earthquake. The second breakup occurred in the early morning hours of December 14, 1994, and, like July 2, originated in southern Idaho and Wyoming. Modern computer and communication technologies greatly facilitated dissemination of information, analysis, report writing, and event simulation for the July 2 cascading outage.

Voltage drop and other network calculations can be performed only after the length of each cable segment is determined. Although automatic cable routers are currently available, they are mainly for formally planned urban areas. These routers are not always appropriate for use in designing rural distribution networks, because they fail to account for some of the special circumstances found in rural areas. A more practical approach bases automatic cable routing on the terrain of a given area rather than on the layout of roads. The automatic Distribution Network Router (DNR) finds the least-cost path (not merely the shortest one) connecting two nodes. This article briefly discusses methods currently used to determine cable routes for distribution networks, the unsuitability of these methods for routing cables in rural and informal urban areas, the proposed approach that relies on dividing the terrain into cost regions, and the benefits gained in its application. Emphasis is on the practical application of the new approach.","","","","","","United States","1997-01-01T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: IEEE Computer Applications in Power; Journal Volume: 10; Journal Issue: 1; Other Information: PBD: Jan 1997","","Medium: X; Size: pp. 42-46","","","","Journal ID: ICAPEH; ISSN 0895-0156; TRN: IM9712%%108","10.1109/67.560861","","2009-12-16T00:00:00Z","442683","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/442683","","IEEE Computer Applications in Power","1","10"

The package featured in this article is designed for the many new players in the power industry who will never operate an actual system but who must have a basic understanding of its operations.","","","","","","United States","1997-01-01T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: IEEE Computer Applications in Power; Journal Volume: 10; Journal Issue: 1; Other Information: PBD: Jan 1997","","Medium: X; Size: pp. 53-58","","","","Journal ID: ICAPEH; ISSN 0895-0156; TRN: IM9712%%110","10.1109/67.560868","","2009-12-16T00:00:00Z","442685","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/442685","","IEEE Computer Applications in Power","1","10"
"Developing an electrical distribution monitoring system","Roldan, M C.S.C.; Alonso-Betanzos, A; Arias-Rodriguez, J E","24 POWER TRANSMISSION AND DISTRIBUTION; COMPUTERIZED CONTROL SYSTEMS; POWER DISTRIBUTION SYSTEMS; ENERGY MANAGEMENT SYSTEMS; MAN-MACHINE SYSTEMS; HUMAN FACTORS ENGINEERING","Modern industrial production processes have always been supervised and/or controlled in many different ways. The evolution of control methods was motivated by technological advances and by the requirements of the processes themselves. Many processes are supervised and controlled in an automated environment due to improvements in electronics and computer science. In the electric power industry, there is a strong need to control and supervise the production and distribution of energy, so as to avoid possible power failures. The supply of energy must always be guaranteed (even in adverse conditions), and control involves different systems (high and low voltage lines, compensation, and filtering systems, etc.), so operators require quick and reliable access to meaningful information. The option to interfere in some processes must be provided. All these goals are accomplished using an appropriate control architecture, communication networks, and symbolic representation of electrical network systems. Operator efficiency will be assured if these requirements are met. There are no unique guidelines for developing electrical monitoring projects, since any choice will depend on many specific variables; however, the most important points to take into account are covered in this article.","","","","","","United States","1997-01-01T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: IEEE Computer Applications in Power; Journal Volume: 10; Journal Issue: 1; Other Information: PBD: Jan 1997","","Medium: X; Size: pp. 36-41","","","","Journal ID: ICAPEH; ISSN 0895-0156; TRN: IM9712%%107","10.1109/67.560857","","2009-12-16T00:00:00Z","442682","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/442682","","IEEE Computer Applications in Power","1","10"

Hydrogen permeation out of the heat pipe is enhanced by using a condenser design with a re-entrant annular gas cavity and an array of small diameter, thin-walled tubes to increase the permeation area. An experimental heat pipe with a nickel envelope was fabricated and tested. The heat pipe operated between 993K and 1073K, using sodium as the working fluid. During steady-state operation, hydrogen gas was injected into the heat pipe. The response of the heat pipe was monitored while the hydrogen permeated out of the heat pipe in the condenser section. For each of the tests run, the hydrogen gas was removed from the heat pipe in approximately 5 to 10 minutes. A model of the experimental heat pipe was developed to predict the enhancement in the hydrogen permeation rate out of the heat pipe. A significant improvement in the rate at which hydrogen permeates out of a heat pipe was predicted for the use of the special condenser geometry developed here. Agreement between the model and the experimental results was qualitatively good. Inclusion of the additional effects of fluid flow in the heat pipe are recommended for future work. {copyright} {ital 1997 American Institute of Physics.}","","","","USDOE","","United States","1997-01-01T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: AIP Conference Proceedings; Journal Volume: 387; Journal Issue: 1; Conference: Space technology and applications international forum (STAIF - 97), Albuquerque, NM (United States), 26-30 Jan 1997; Other Information: PBD: Jan 1997","","Medium: X; Size: pp. 345-352","","CONF-970115-","FG01-94NE32182","Journal ID: APCPCS; ISSN 0094-243X; TRN: 9808M0003","10.1063/1.52013","","2016-05-05T00:00:00Z","627584","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/627584","","AIP Conference Proceedings","1","387"
"Ampacity of cables in single covered trays","Harshe, B L; Black, W Z","20 FOSSIL-FUELED POWER PLANTS; 24 POWER TRANSMISSION AND DISTRIBUTION; ELECTRIC CABLES; CAPACITY; POWER PLANTS; MATHEMATICAL MODELS; CALCULATION METHODS","A mathematical thermal model is developed to predict the operating temperatures of cables in a single covered tray when there is load diversity in the cable bundle. The model accommodates two different loading scenarios--one in which the heat is distributed evenly across the cable tray cross section and the second one which concentrates the heavily loaded cables along the centerline, while surrounding them with more lightly loaded cables. The temperature predictions provided by the model are compared to data found in other IEEE papers, data collected in laboratory measurements, and new data from a four-year study of cable trays in an operating nuclear plant. Reasons for differences between the field data and the computer results are discussed. The model is used to evaluate the conservatism in the available Codes and Standards. A derating factor is introduced that is defined in terms of the ampacity of cables in open-top trays. The derating factor accounts for the added thermal resistance present when a cover is placed over the cables, trapping a layer of stagnant air on top of the cable mass. The computer model is then used to predict values for the derating factor as a function of cable depth. The derating factor is shown to be independent of the composition of cables in the tray. The presence of a cover is shown to reduce the ampacity based on an uncovered tray by up to 25 percent depending on the depth of the cables in the tray.","","","","","","United States","1997-01-01T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: IEEE Transactions on Power Delivery; Journal Volume: 12; Journal Issue: 1; Conference: IEEE Power Engineering Society (PES) Winter meeting, Baltimore, MD (United States), 21-25 Jan 1996; Other Information: PBD: Jan 1997","","Medium: X; Size: pp. 3-14","","CONF-960111-","","Journal ID: ITPDE5; ISSN 0885-8977; TRN: IM9724%%56","10.1109/61.568219","","2009-12-16T00:00:00Z","477179","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/477179","","IEEE Transactions on Power Delivery","1","12"
"Dielectric performance of interfaces in premolded cable joints","Dang, C; Fournier, D","24 POWER TRANSMISSION AND DISTRIBUTION; ELECTRIC CABLES; JOINTS; DIELECTRIC PROPERTIES; GREASES; ELECTRIC ARCS","Great progress has been made in developing high-quality insulating materials, in maintaining consistent manufacturing processes, and in designing cable joints for easy installation. However, little attention has been given to the interfaces in cable joints. Greases are generally used as a lubricant for installation of premolded cable joints (excluding heat-shrink and cold-shrink splices), and are therefore always found at these interfaces. Analysis of field-aged cable joints has revealed two common problems related to greases dry and sticky interfaces causing great difficulties in power disconnection, and interfacial discharges (or surface tracking) leading to dielectric breakdown. The focus of this study is on the dielectric performance of interfaces in cable joints. Measurements of breakdown voltage and pressure were carried out at interfaces of both new and field-aged cable joints. The effect of surface conditions was also investigated. Results show that the dielectric performance at interfaces is intimately related to the surface conditions, and a distinct long-term behavior is found for each type of interface in cable joints. The significance of the results and their implications are discussed.","","","","Hydro-Quebec, Montreal, PQ (Canada)","","United States","1997-01-01T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: IEEE Transactions on Power Delivery; Journal Volume: 12; Journal Issue: 1; Conference: 1996 Summer meeting of the IEEE Power Engineering Society, Denver, CO (United States), 28 Jul - 1 Aug 1996; Other Information: PBD: Jan 1997","","Medium: X; Size: pp. 29-32","","CONF-960725-","","Journal ID: ITPDE5; ISSN 0885-8977; TRN: IM9724%%58","10.1109/61.568221","","2009-12-16T00:00:00Z","477181","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/477181","","IEEE Transactions on Power Delivery","1","12"

Adaptive relaying seeks to make adjustments to the relay characteristics as system conditions change, thereby making the relay more attuned to the prevailing power system conditions. The work described here began as a theoretical examination of the out-of-step relaying application, its possible shortcomings, and the opportunities to make adaptive improvements. It is shown that for a system that behaves primarily as a two-machine power system, the out-of-step relay could be made more secure by applying the principle of equal area criterion. The paper describes the theory of such a relay, its hardware configuration, and the system as it is installed in the field. The newly developed technology of synchronized phasor measurements plays an important role in the realization of this relay.

Reliable and fast phase selection is thus imperative in order to avoid potential problems of system insecurity and instability. Conventional phase selectors, primarily based on power frequency measurands, can suffer some impairment in performance because of their heavy dependency on varying system and fault conditions. However, the advent of artificial neural networks (ANNs), with their ability to map complex and highly non-linear input/output patterns, provides an attractive potential solution to the long-standing problems of accurate and fast phase selection. This paper describes the design of a novel phase selector using ANNs. The technique is based on utilizing fault generated high frequency noise (captured through the high voltage coupling capacitor of a conventional Capacitor Voltage Transformer) to essentially recognize the various patterns generated within the frequency spectra of the fault generated noise signals on the three phases, for the purposes of accurately deducing the faulted phase. The paper demonstrates a new concept and methodology in phase selection which will facilitate single-pole autoreclosure applications in power systems.","","","","","","United States","1997-01-01T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: IEEE Transactions on Power Delivery; Journal Volume: 12; Journal Issue: 1; Conference: IEEE Power Engineering Society (PES) Winter meeting, Baltimore, MD (United States), 21-25 Jan 1996; Other Information: PBD: Jan 1997","","Medium: X; Size: pp. 106-115","","CONF-960111-","","Journal ID: ITPDE5; ISSN 0885-8977; TRN: IM9724%%67","10.1109/61.568230","","2009-12-16T00:00:00Z","477190","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/477190","","IEEE Transactions on Power Delivery","1","12"
"Voltage escalation and reignition behavior of vacuum generator circuit breakers during load shedding","Glinkowski, M T; Gutierrez, M R; Braun, D","24 POWER TRANSMISSION AND DISTRIBUTION; CIRCUIT BREAKERS; LOAD MANAGEMENT; ELECTRICAL TRANSIENTS; PERFORMANCE; RESPONSE FUNCTIONS","This paper focuses on multiple reignitions and voltage escalation that may occur during load shedding when vacuum circuit-breakers are used as generator circuit-breakers. The probability of multiple reignitions and voltage escalation is proportional to the arc angle and is very small. However, repeated reignitions and voltage escalation may be observed in vacuum switching devices after opening operations due to their ability to interrupt high frequency currents. The transformer side capacitance and the magnitude of the load shedding play a significant role in developing repeated reignitions and voltage escalation when vacuum circuit breakers are used as generator circuit breakers. Of particular concern is the case when a protective capacitor is connected to the system side of the circuit breaker. Although this capacitor reduces the magnitude of the Transient Recovery Voltage, it decreases the transient frequencies and increases the reignition current that flows through the vacuum circuit breaker after a voltage breakdown. In all the cases under study, the reignition/escalation problems are more severe with the protective capacitor connected to the system for relative low load shedding at short arc angles.","","","","","","United States","1997-01-01T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: IEEE Transactions on Power Delivery; Journal Volume: 12; Journal Issue: 1; Conference: 1996 Summer meeting of the IEEE Power Engineering Society, Denver, CO (United States), 28 Jul - 1 Aug 1996; Other Information: PBD: Jan 1997","","Medium: X; Size: pp. 219-226","","CONF-960725-","","Journal ID: ITPDE5; ISSN 0885-8977; TRN: IM9724%%81","10.1109/61.568244","","2009-12-16T00:00:00Z","477204","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/477204","","IEEE Transactions on Power Delivery","1","12"

"Frequency estimation by demodulation of two complex signals","Akke, M","24 POWER TRANSMISSION AND DISTRIBUTION; FREQUENCY MEASUREMENT; POWER SYSTEMS; SIGNAL-TO-NOISE RATIO; ACCURACY; EQUIPMENT PROTECTION DEVICES","This paper presents a method for frequency estimation in power system by demodulation of two complex signals. In power system analysis, the {alpha}{beta}-transform is used to convert three phase quantities to a complex quantity where the real part is the quadrature component. This complex signal is demodulated with a known complex phasor rotating in opposite direction to the input. The advantage of this method is that the demodulation does not introduce a double frequency component. For signals with high signal to noise ratio, the filtering demand for the double frequency component can often limit the speed of the frequency estimator. Hence, the method can improve fast frequency estimation of signals with good noise properties. The method looses its benefit for noisy signals, where the filter design is governed by the demand to filter harmonics and white noise. The method has been previously published, but not explored to its potential. The paper presents four examples to illustrate the strengths and weaknesses of the method.","","","","","","United States","1997-01-01T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: IEEE Transactions on Power Delivery; Journal Volume: 12; Journal Issue: 1; Conference: 1996 Summer meeting of the IEEE Power Engineering Society, Denver, CO (United States), 28 Jul - 1 Aug 1996; Other Information: PBD: Jan 1997","","Medium: X; Size: pp. 157-163","","CONF-960725-","","Journal ID: ITPDE5; ISSN 0885-8977; TRN: IM9724%%72","10.1109/61.568235","","2009-12-16T00:00:00Z","477195","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/477195","","IEEE Transactions on Power Delivery","1","12"

Digital simulation results are presented and compared with the results by using just the reactive current control with fundamental switching frequency.","","","","Electric Power Research Inst., Palo Alto, CA (United States)","","United States","1997-01-01T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: IEEE Transactions on Power Delivery; Journal Volume: 12; Journal Issue: 1; Conference: International symposium on electric power engineering, Stockholm (Sweden), 18-22 Jun 1995; Other Information: PBD: Jan 1997","","Medium: X; Size: pp. 273-278","","CONF-950635-","","Journal ID: ITPDE5; ISSN 0885-8977; TRN: IM9724%%87","10.1109/61.568250","","2009-12-16T00:00:00Z","477210","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/477210","","IEEE Transactions on Power Delivery","1","12"
"Surface voltages and resistance of grounding systems of grid and rods in two-layer earth by the rapid Galerkin`s moment method","Chow, Y L; Salama, M M.A.; Elsherbiny, M M","24 POWER TRANSMISSION AND DISTRIBUTION; POWER SUBSTATIONS; ELECTRIC GROUNDS; PHYSICAL PROPERTIES; ELECTRICAL PROPERTIES; OPERATION; SAFETY","The point matching moment method has been the prime candidate for grounding system analysis. The regular method yields accurate results as long as the segmentation is very fine. This means a large number of basis functions and frequently requires a supercomputer. In the present paper, the authors propose an alternate moment method in the Galerkin`s form. This form is variational (i.e., with error reduction property) which allows for very few basis functions, resulting in a very fast convergence but still gives less than 2% error in the grounding resistance. Each basis function in this form can be a whole rod with uniform current distribution, representing a vertical driven rod or a horizontal rod across a whole grid. Such basis functions give good results in the grounding resistance, it is obvious that they need not give good results in the voltages (ground potential rise -- GPR, touch, and step) on the earth surface near the grid intersections. To correct this, a second type of a basis functions, namely spheres, is added at the intersections. Since the intersections are few, the total number of basis functions is still small. With such basis functions added, however, the resulting voltage now have errors generally less than 4%. With such high accuracy and small matrix size ({approx} 10X10 to 50X50) in the moment method it is easy to do parametric studies, even for an extensive grounding system.","","","","","","United States","1997-01-01T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: IEEE Transactions on Power Delivery; Journal Volume: 12; Journal Issue: 1; Conference: 1996 Summer meeting of the IEEE Power Engineering Society, Denver, CO (United States), 28 Jul - 1 Aug 1996; Other Information: PBD: Jan 1997","","Medium: X; Size: pp. 179-185","","CONF-960725-","","Journal ID: ITPDE5; ISSN 0885-8977; TRN: IM9724%%76","10.1109/61.568239","","2009-12-16T00:00:00Z","477199","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/477199","","IEEE Transactions on Power Delivery","1","12"

To overcome these problems a combined system of a passive filter, using only one LC filter tuned to the lowest typical line current harmonic, and a shunt active power filter, sharing the filter capacitor to be decoupled from the fundamental line voltage, is proposed. These features strongly decrease the rated power of the active filter which is controlled only to suppress the harmonics of higher order and to eliminate resonance effects between the line impedance and the passive filter.","","","","","","United States","1997-01-01T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: IEEE Transactions on Power Delivery; Journal Volume: 12; Journal Issue: 1; Conference: International symposium on electric power engineering, Stockholm (Sweden), 18-22 Jun 1995; Other Information: PBD: Jan 1997","","Medium: X; Size: pp. 266-272","","CONF-950635-","","Journal ID: ITPDE5; ISSN 0885-8977; TRN: IM9724%%86","10.1109/61.568249","","2009-12-16T00:00:00Z","477209","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/477209","","IEEE Transactions on Power Delivery","1","12"

The induced voltage is calculated by the method where the tangential component of the electric field to the overhead wire is looked upon as inducing sources. Accuracy of the calculated result is ensured with experimental results obtained by using a reduced-scale model. The induced voltage on an overhead wire turns out to be influenced by its branch, and is found to be dependent not only on the configuration of a branch line but also on the location of the lightning striking point.

This compensator, called Static Synchronous Series Compensator (SSSC), can provide controllable compensating voltage over an identical capacitive and inductive range, independently of the magnitude of the line current. It is immune to classical network resonances. In addition to series reactive compensation, with an external dc power supply it can also compensate the voltage drop across the resistive component of the line impedance. The compensation of the real part of the impedance can maintain high X/R ratio even if the line has very high degree of series compensation. Concurrent and coordinated modulation of reactive and real compensation can greatly increase power oscillation damping. The paper discusses the basic operating and performance characteristics of the SSSC, and compares them to those characterizing the more conventional compensators based on thyristor-switched or controlled series capacitors. It also presents some of the results of TNA simulations carried out with an SSSC hardware model.","","","","","","United States","1997-01-01T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: IEEE Transactions on Power Delivery; Journal Volume: 12; Journal Issue: 1; Conference: IEEE Power Engineering Society (PES) Winter meeting, Baltimore, MD (United States), 21-25 Jan 1996; Other Information: PBD: Jan 1997","","Medium: X; Size: pp. 406-417","","CONF-960111-","","Journal ID: ITPDE5; ISSN 0885-8977; TRN: IM9724%%102","10.1109/61.568265","","2009-12-16T00:00:00Z","477225","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/477225","","IEEE Transactions on Power Delivery","1","12"

Because of lack of information and experimental data about the real power and reactive power demands at the various nodes of the distribution feeder, it has been customary to assume uniform load characteristics at constant power factor for the loads along the feeder. This paper presents an optimal capacitor allocation method that uses sensitivity factors and a characterization scheme for the load demands at the various feeder nodes. Sensitivity factors are used to reduce the number of solution alternatives to be evaluated. A distribution-analyzer-recorder (DAR) has been developed to collect data from the feeder. The data collected is processed into load multipliers that are used as input data for the optimization process. The proposed method has been applied to two test feeders, and simulation results appear very promising.","","","","","","United States","1997-01-01T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: IEEE Transactions on Power Delivery; Journal Volume: 12; Journal Issue: 1; Conference: 1996 Summer meeting of the IEEE Power Engineering Society, Denver, CO (United States), 28 Jul - 1 Aug 1996; Other Information: PBD: Jan 1997","","Medium: X; Size: pp. 464-469","","CONF-960725-","","Journal ID: ITPDE5; ISSN 0885-8977; TRN: IM9724%%109","10.1109/61.568272","","2009-12-16T00:00:00Z","477232","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/477232","","IEEE Transactions on Power Delivery","1","12"

The overall technique relies on the inherent functional and logical relationships between system elements such as lines, buses, relays and breakers to generate a diagnostic model rather than on experientially derived heuristics. This approach allows for a systematic implementation scheme that is more readily adapted to any power system. Logical models for relays, breakers, lines and buses are presented along with examples on how these models can be interconnected to represent a power system. The resulting system model can simulate the forward behavior of a power system. Inputs to the forward model consist of disorders or disturbances, and the outputs are manifestations or alarms. Using abductive logic, a reverse system model can be generated. This system model takes the alarms as inputs and produces a diagnosis by generating sets of disorders or disturbances that explain the observed alarms.","","","","","","United States","1997-01-01T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: IEEE Transactions on Power Delivery; Journal Volume: 12; Journal Issue: 1; Conference: 1996 Summer meeting of the IEEE Power Engineering Society, Denver, CO (United States), 28 Jul - 1 Aug 1996; Other Information: PBD: Jan 1997","","Medium: X; Size: pp. 515-522","","CONF-960725-","","Journal ID: ITPDE5; ISSN 0885-8977; TRN: IM9724%%116","10.1109/61.568279","","2009-12-16T00:00:00Z","477239","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/477239","","IEEE Transactions on Power Delivery","1","12"

The current lead has a cross sectional area altered along its axis in order to decrease the heat inlet and to prevent SF6 gas from liquefying. The current lead is insulated with Ethylene-propylene Rubber (EPR) because it passes through nitrogen gas which has low dielectric strength in comparison with liquid nitrogen and SF6 gas. 200A AC current and 70 kV AC voltage to ground were successfully applied simultaneously for 40 hours in total. The measured heat loss of the termination, 9W is in good agreement with the calculated value. As the next step, the applied voltage was increased and the termination was confirmed to withstand the voltage up to 120 kV AC and 400kV Imp to ground.","","","","","","United States","1997-01-01T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: IEEE Transactions on Power Delivery; Journal Volume: 12; Journal Issue: 1; Conference: 1996 Summer meeting of the IEEE Power Engineering Society, Denver, CO (United States), 28 Jul - 1 Aug 1996; Other Information: PBD: Jan 1997","","Medium: X; Size: pp. 33-38","","CONF-960725-","","Journal ID: ITPDE5; ISSN 0885-8977; TRN: IM9724%%59","10.1109/61.568222","","2009-12-16T00:00:00Z","477182","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/477182","","IEEE Transactions on Power Delivery","1","12"
"Adaptive distance protection of double-circuit lines using artificial neural networks","Jongepier, A G; Sluis, L van der","24 POWER TRANSMISSION AND DISTRIBUTION; EQUIPMENT PROTECTION DEVICES; EHV AC SYSTEMS; NEURAL NETWORKS; ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE; LEARNING","Because of the zero sequence mutual coupling of parallel circuits, the distance calculation performed by a ground distance relay is incorrect. This error is influenced by the actual power system condition. Although accounted for by using a large safety margin in the zone boundaries, unexpected overreach can still occur and the operation speed is decreased. Adaptive protection offers an approach to compensate for the influence of the variable power system conditions. By adapting the relay settings to the actual power system condition, the relay will respond more accurately to power system faults. The selectivity of the protection system is increased, as is the power system reliability. In this paper, an adaptive distance relaying concept is presented. In order to minimize the required communication, local measurements are used to estimate the entire power system condition. An artificial neutral network is used to estimate the actual power system condition and to calculate the appropriate tripping impedance.","","","","","","United States","1997-01-01T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: IEEE Transactions on Power Delivery; Journal Volume: 12; Journal Issue: 1; Conference: IEEE Power Engineering Society (PES) Winter meeting, Baltimore, MD (United States), 21-25 Jan 1996; Other Information: PBD: Jan 1997","","Medium: X; Size: pp. 97-105","","CONF-960111-","","Journal ID: ITPDE5; ISSN 0885-8977; TRN: IM9724%%66","10.1109/61.568229","","2009-12-16T00:00:00Z","477189","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/477189","","IEEE Transactions on Power Delivery","1","12"

"Sizing of cables in randomly-filled trays with consideration for load diversity","Leake, H C","20 FOSSIL-FUELED POWER PLANTS; 24 POWER TRANSMISSION AND DISTRIBUTION; ELECTRIC CABLES; CAPACITY; AMBIENT TEMPERATURE; HEAT TRANSFER; CALCULATION METHODS","Method for demonstrating increased ampacity of cables in trays with loading diversity. Ampacity tables for sizing cables in randomly-filled cable trays are provided in NEMA WC 51-1986 based on a model developed by J. Stolpe which ensures that the maximum cable temperature does not exceed the insulation rating (typically 90 C) under worst-case conditions. The Stolpe model intentionally disregards the reduced heating effect of deenergized or lightly-loaded cables to ensure that all possible hot spot conditions are enveloped. In recent years other methods have been proposed to credit loading diversity in order to justify increased ampacity. However, since they involve certain assumptions about the heat distribution within the cable mass, these methods may fail to identify individual overloaded conductors. This paper describes a simple method which considers the performance of individual conductors while providing a means of increasing ampacity as a result of loading diversity.","","","","","","United States","1997-01-01T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: IEEE Transactions on Power Delivery; Journal Volume: 12; Journal Issue: 1; Conference: 1996 Summer meeting of the IEEE Power Engineering Society, Denver, CO (United States), 28 Jul - 1 Aug 1996; Other Information: PBD: Jan 1997","","Medium: X; Size: pp. 39-45","","CONF-960725-","","Journal ID: ITPDE5; ISSN 0885-8977; TRN: IM9724%%60","10.1109/61.568223","","2009-12-16T00:00:00Z","477183","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/477183","","IEEE Transactions on Power Delivery","1","12"

This paper presents analysis of the influence of soil conductivity, location of feed point, grid size, depth, conductor separation, ground rods, and shape of the lightning current impulse, on the transient performance of ground grids with sizes ranging from 10 x 10 m{sup 2} to 120 x 120 m{sup 2} and with 4 to 124 meshes. Maximal transient ground potential rise and frequency dependent impedance are analyzed in time and frequency domain, respectively. Computations are made with computer model based on the electromagnetic field theory approach, taking accurately into account frequency dependent characteristics of large ground grids. Instead of usual simple approximations of the lightning current impulse, recorded channel base currents from triggered lightning are used for the time domain analysis.","","","","","","United States","1997-01-01T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: IEEE Transactions on Power Delivery; Journal Volume: 12; Journal Issue: 1; Conference: 1996 Summer meeting of the IEEE Power Engineering Society, Denver, CO (United States), 28 Jul - 1 Aug 1996; Other Information: PBD: Jan 1997","","Medium: X; Size: pp. 172-178","","CONF-960725-","","Journal ID: ITPDE5; ISSN 0885-8977; TRN: IM9724%%75","10.1109/61.568238","","2009-12-16T00:00:00Z","477198","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/477198","","IEEE Transactions on Power Delivery","1","12"

"An algorithm for compensating secondary currents of current transformers","Kang, Y C; Park, J K; Kang, S H; Johns, A T; Aggarwal, R K","24 POWER TRANSMISSION AND DISTRIBUTION; TRANSFORMERS; RELAYS; CONTROL; ALGORITHMS; STABILIZATION","Current transformer (CT) saturation may cause relays to malfunction. The conventional method to deal with the problem is overdimensioning of the core so that CTs can carry up to 20 times the rated current without exceeding 10% ratio correction. However, this not only reduces the sensitivity of relays, but also increases the CT core size. This paper presents a technique of estimating the secondary current corresponding to the CT ratio under CT saturation. The proposed algorithm can improve the sensitivity of relays to low level internal faults, minimize the instability of relays for external faults, and might ultimately assist in reducing the dimension of the required CT core cross section.","","","","","","United States","1997-01-01T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: IEEE Transactions on Power Delivery; Journal Volume: 12; Journal Issue: 1; Conference: IEEE Power Engineering Society (PES) Winter meeting, Baltimore, MD (United States), 21-25 Jan 1996; Other Information: PBD: Jan 1997","","Medium: X; Size: pp. 116-124","","CONF-960111-","","Journal ID: ITPDE5; ISSN 0885-8977; TRN: IM9724%%68","10.1109/61.568231","","2009-12-16T00:00:00Z","477191","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/477191","","IEEE Transactions on Power Delivery","1","12"

The measurements were compared to the temperature rise values obtained on the same transformers operating in overexcitation at 1.95 T. The results show that the tie plates of this particular type of transformer are the components most susceptible to rapid temperature rise. Smaller-scale tests on 100-kVA transformers were performed to take a specific look at these tie plates under the effect of a temperature increase. Finite-element simulations combined with analytical studies of temperature rise were performed in an attempt to determine a tolerable dc current limit based on permissible temperature standards.","","","","","","United States","1997-01-01T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: IEEE Transactions on Power Delivery; Journal Volume: 12; Journal Issue: 1; Conference: IEEE Power Engineering Society (PES) Winter meeting, Baltimore, MD (United States), 21-25 Jan 1996; Other Information: PBD: Jan 1997","","Medium: X; Size: pp. 257-265","","CONF-960111-","","Journal ID: ITPDE5; ISSN 0885-8977; TRN: IM9724%%85","10.1109/61.568248","","2009-12-16T00:00:00Z","477208","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/477208","","IEEE Transactions on Power Delivery","1","12"

"The response of fluorescent lamp with magnetic ballast to voltage distortion","Emanuel, A E; Peretto, L","24 POWER TRANSMISSION AND DISTRIBUTION; FLUORESCENT LAMPS; RESPONSE FUNCTIONS; PERFORMANCE TESTING; HARMONICS; ELECTRIC POWER; QUALITY CONTROL; MATHEMATICAL MODELS","Fluorescent lamps belong to the electric discharge lamp family, they convert the electrical energy into light by transforming electrical energy into kinetic energy of moving electrons and ions. The v{sub a}/i characteristic for an arc discharge lamp operating at 60Hz is nonlinear, Fig. 2a. The instantaneous power developed by the arc is p = v{sub a}i. The arc voltage v{sub a} remains nearly constant during each half-cycle of the current, Fig. 2b. The value V{sub a} depends on the lamp geometry (length, diameter) and the physical properties of the plasma (type of gas and pressure). This paper explains the light flicker mechanism in fluorescent lamps with magnetic ballast. The light flicker is caused by the jitter of the ignition angle. Voltage noninteger harmonics are found to be the main cause of flicker. Experimental oscillograms confirm the analytical model.","","","","","","United States","1997-01-01T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: IEEE Transactions on Power Delivery; Journal Volume: 12; Journal Issue: 1; Conference: IEEE Power Engineering Society (PES) Winter meeting, Baltimore, MD (United States), 21-25 Jan 1996; Other Information: PBD: Jan 1997","","Medium: X; Size: pp. 289-295","","CONF-960111-","","Journal ID: ITPDE5; ISSN 0885-8977; TRN: IM9724%%89","10.1109/61.568252","","2009-12-16T00:00:00Z","477212","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/477212","","IEEE Transactions on Power Delivery","1","12"

This simulation method is very useful in designing electric devices using magnetically driven arc technique. First, the authors describe the arc model. In this model, the arc is assumed to be a chain of small rigid cylindrical current elements. Each element receives Lorentz`s force from the magnetic field and a fluid drag force from the surrounding gas. Owing to the similarity between an arc and a rigid column, the drag force of the arc is expressed by that of the column. The element moves with the velocity determined by these forces. Consequently, the authors can obtain the behavior and the shape of the whole arc. Finally, simulation example is shown.","","","","","","United States","1997-01-01T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: IEEE Transactions on Power Delivery; Journal Volume: 12; Journal Issue: 1; Conference: 1996 Summer meeting of the IEEE Power Engineering Society, Denver, CO (United States), 28 Jul - 1 Aug 1996; Other Information: PBD: Jan 1997","","Medium: X; Size: pp. 213-218","","CONF-960725-","","Journal ID: ITPDE5; ISSN 0885-8977; TRN: IM9724%%80","10.1109/61.568243","","2009-12-16T00:00:00Z","477203","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/477203","","IEEE Transactions on Power Delivery","1","12"

This relation is based on an approximation which is equivalent to the linearization assumed within each time step in EMTP.

"A theoretical study of the incandescent filament lamp performance under voltage flicker","Peretto, L; Emanuel, A E","24 POWER TRANSMISSION AND DISTRIBUTION; LIGHT BULBS; RESPONSE FUNCTIONS; PERFORMANCE TESTING; HARMONICS; ELECTRIC POWER; QUALITY CONTROL; MATHEMATICAL MODELS","Incandescent filament lamp flicker, produced by voltage fluctuation, is a power quality problem that caused engineering concern since the onset of electrical illumination technology. The flicker phenomenon was analyzed and explained in early studies. Standards dealing with acceptable flicker levels are well known, nevertheless, today the discussion about flicker continues to be a top priority topic due to the fact that steady-state and transient voltage waveform distortion is a growing problem in low and medium voltage systems. In many situations voltage flicker is caused by subharmonics and interharmonics of voltage. Cycloconverters, welders and arc furnaces, eccentrically operating tools and integral cycle controlled power equipment are notorious for producing voltage flicker. The goal of this paper is to provide solid mathematical basis for the analytical modeling of incandescent filament lamp flicker when the voltage is nonsinusoidal. A mathematical model that enables the evaluation of the luminous flux modulation caused by noninteger harmonics (subharmonics and interharmonics) is presented. Three situations are detailed: square-wave voltage modulation, sinusoidal modulation and the case of noninteger harmonics with nearly contiguous frequencies.","","","","","","United States","1997-01-01T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: IEEE Transactions on Power Delivery; Journal Volume: 12; Journal Issue: 1; Conference: IEEE Power Engineering Society (PES) Winter meeting, Baltimore, MD (United States), 21-25 Jan 1996; Other Information: PBD: Jan 1997","","Medium: X; Size: pp. 279-288","","CONF-960111-","","Journal ID: ITPDE5; ISSN 0885-8977; TRN: IM9724%%88","10.1109/61.568251","","2009-12-16T00:00:00Z","477211","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/477211","","IEEE Transactions on Power Delivery","1","12"

"EMTP modeling of electromagnetic transients in multi-mode coaxial cables by finite sections","Meredith, R J","24 POWER TRANSMISSION AND DISTRIBUTION; COAXIAL CABLES; TRANSFORMERS; ELECTROMAGNETIC FIELDS; E CODES; ELECTRIC CABLES; TRANSIENTS","This paper introduces a way of modeling electromagnetic propagation in conductive materials, termed the method of finite sections. It addresses the issues of modeling frequency-dependent impedances and frequency-dependent coupling of conductors. Its use is demonstrated by application to transient modeling of a multi-mode coaxial cable system in the Electromagnetic Transients Program (EMTP), a situation which currently eludes accurate representation. In addition to its use in modeling coaxial cables, the method is applicable to modeling of overhead lines, pipe-type cables, transformer cores and walls, lightning arrestors and other situations in which sufficient planar or cylindrical symmetry exists. The method provides the only accurate EMTP means of modeling wave propagation in non-linear resistive and/or inductive conductors.","","","","","","United States","1997-01-01T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: IEEE Transactions on Power Delivery; Journal Volume: 12; Journal Issue: 1; Conference: 1996 Summer meeting of the IEEE Power Engineering Society, Denver, CO (United States), 28 Jul - 1 Aug 1996; Other Information: PBD: Jan 1997","","Medium: X; Size: pp. 489-496","","CONF-960725-","","Journal ID: ITPDE5; ISSN 0885-8977; TRN: IM9724%%113","10.1109/61.568276","","2009-12-16T00:00:00Z","477236","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/477236","","IEEE Transactions on Power Delivery","1","12"

A suitable small-signal model is developed which allows selection of control coefficients, analysis of parameter variation effects, characterization of the closed-loop behavior in terms of audiosusceptibility, output and input impedances, and reference to output transfer function. Unlike previous analyses, the model includes effects of the filters used to evaluate state variable errors.

"Analysis and control of a cellular converter system with stochastic ripple cancellation and minimal magnetics","Perreault, D J; Kassakian, J G","24 POWER TRANSMISSION AND DISTRIBUTION; DC TO DC CONVERTERS; INVERTERS; POWER TRANSMISSION; CONTROL THEORY; STRESSES; POWER LOSSES; MINIMIZATION","A parallel converter architecture based on the resonant pole inverter (RPI) topology is presented. It is shown that this architecture minimizes the output magnetics required for current sharing. A new current control scheme is introduced which reduces peak currents, losses, and output voltage ripple for many operating conditions. This new control method is applicable to both the single RPI and the parallel architecture. Additionally, the paper analytically quantifies the degree of passive ripple cancellation between cells of a parallel architecture. It is shown that the rms ripple current of an N-cell paralleled converter system is a factor of 1/{radical}N lower than for an equivalent single converter. These results are verified using a piecewise-linear model. The authors conclude that the parallel architecture overcomes some of the major disadvantages of the conventional RPI.","","","","","","United States","1997-01-01T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: IEEE Transactions on Power Electronics; Journal Volume: 12; Journal Issue: 1; Other Information: PBD: Jan 1997","","Medium: X; Size: pp. 145-152","","","","Journal ID: ITPEE8; ISSN 0885-8993; TRN: IM9728%%91","10.1109/63.554180","","2009-12-16T00:00:00Z","488900","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/488900","","IEEE Transactions on Power Electronics","1","12"

The former type of failure is particularly serious since it may result in the isolation of large sections of the network. However, the probability of a failure to operate can be reduced by carrying out preventive maintenance on protection systems. This paper describes an approach to determine the impact of preventive maintenance on protection systems on the reliability of the power supply to customers. The proposed approach is based on Markov models.","","","","","","United States","1997-01-01T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: IEEE Transactions on Power Delivery; Journal Volume: 12; Journal Issue: 1; Conference: IEEE Power Engineering Society (PES) Winter meeting, Baltimore, MD (United States), 21-25 Jan 1996; Other Information: PBD: Jan 1997","","Medium: X; Size: pp. 125-133","","CONF-960111-","","Journal ID: ITPDE5; ISSN 0885-8977; TRN: IM9724%%69","10.1109/61.568232","","2009-12-16T00:00:00Z","477192","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/477192","","IEEE Transactions on Power Delivery","1","12"

"Control strategy and site selection of a shunt active filter for damping of harmonic propagation in power distribution systems","Akagi, Hirofumi","24 POWER TRANSMISSION AND DISTRIBUTION; POWER DISTRIBUTION SYSTEMS; ELECTRIC FILTERS; HARMONICS; DAMPING; POWER CONDITIONING CIRCUITS; COMPUTERIZED SIMULATION","This paper deals with a shunt active filter which will be installed by an electric utility, putting much emphasis on the control strategy and the best point of installation of the shunt active filter on a feeder in a power distribution system. The objective of the shunt active filter is to damp harmonic propagation, which results from harmonic resonance between many capacitors for power factor improvement and line inductors in the feeder, rather than to minimize voltage distortion throughout the feeder. Harmonic mitigation is a welcome ``by-product`` of the shunt active filter, which comes from damping of harmonic propagation. This paper concludes that the shunt active filter based on detection of voltage at the point of installation is superior in stability to others, and that the best site selection is not the beginning terminal but the end terminal of the primary line in the feeder. Computer simulation is performed to verify the validity and effectiveness of the shunt active filter by means of an analog circuit simulator, which is characterized by installing it on a feeder of a radial distribution system in a residential area.","","","","","","United States","1997-01-01T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: IEEE Transactions on Power Delivery; Journal Volume: 12; Journal Issue: 1; Conference: IEEE Power Engineering Society (PES) Winter meeting, Baltimore, MD (United States), 21-25 Jan 1996; Other Information: PBD: Jan 1997","","Medium: X; Size: pp. 354-363","","CONF-960111-","","Journal ID: ITPDE5; ISSN 0885-8977; TRN: IM9724%%96","10.1109/61.568259","","2009-12-16T00:00:00Z","477219","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/477219","","IEEE Transactions on Power Delivery","1","12"

"Creating an electromagnetic transients program in MATLAB: MatEMTP","Mahseredjian, J; Alvarado, F","24 POWER TRANSMISSION AND DISTRIBUTION; POWER SYSTEMS; ELECTRICAL TRANSIENTS; COMPUTERIZED SIMULATION; M CODES; SYSTEMS ANALYSIS; RESPONSE FUNCTIONS","The traditional method for developing electric network analysis computer programs is based on coding using a conventional computer language: FORTRAN, C or Pascal. The programming language of the EMTP (Electromagnetic Transients Program) is FORTRAN-77. Such a program has a closed architecture and uses a large number of code lines to satisfy requirements ranging from low level data manipulation to the actual solution mathematics which eventually become diluted and almost impossible to visualize. This paper proposes a new design idea suitable for EMTP re-development in a high level programming context. It presents the creation of the transient analysis numerical simulator MatEMTP in the computational engine frame of MATLAB. This new approach to software engineering can afford a dramatic coding simplification for sophisticated algorithmic structures.","","","","","","United States","1997-01-01T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: IEEE Transactions on Power Delivery; Journal Volume: 12; Journal Issue: 1; Conference: IEEE Power Engineering Society (PES) Winter meeting, Baltimore, MD (United States), 21-25 Jan 1996; Other Information: PBD: Jan 1997","","Medium: X; Size: pp. 380-388","","CONF-960111-","","Journal ID: ITPDE5; ISSN 0885-8977; TRN: IM9724%%99","10.1109/61.568262","","2009-12-16T00:00:00Z","477222","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/477222","","IEEE Transactions on Power Delivery","1","12"

"Harmonic resonance on parallel high voltage transmission lines","Harries, J R; Randall, J L","24 POWER TRANSMISSION AND DISTRIBUTION; POWER TRANSMISSION LINES; EHV AC SYSTEMS; HARMONICS; RESONANCE; INTERFERENCE; TELEPHONES","The Bonneville Power Administration (BPA) has received complaints of telephone interference over a wide area of northwestern Washington State for several years. However, until 1995 investigations had proved inconclusive as either the source of the harmonics or the operating conditions changed whenever investigators arrived. The 2,100 Hz interference had been noticed at several optically isolated telephone exchanges. The area of complaint corresponded to electric service areas near the transmission line corridors of the BPA Custer-Monroe 500-kV lines. High 2,100 Hz field strength was measured near the 500-kV lines and also under lower voltage lines served from stations along the transmission line corridor. Tests and studies made with the Alternative Transients Program version of the Electromagnetic Transients Program (EMTP) were able to define the phenomena and isolate the source. Harmonic resonance has been observed, measured and modeled on parallel 500-kV lines that are about one wavelength at 2,100 Hz, the 35th harmonic. A seemingly small harmonic injection at one location on the system causes significant problems some distance away such as telephone interference.","","","","USDOE Bonneville Power Administration, Portland, OR (United States)","","United States","1997-01-01T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: IEEE Transactions on Power Delivery; Journal Volume: 12; Journal Issue: 1; Conference: 1996 Summer meeting of the IEEE Power Engineering Society, Denver, CO (United States), 28 Jul - 1 Aug 1996; Other Information: PBD: Jan 1997","","Medium: X; Size: pp. 477-482","","CONF-960725-","","Journal ID: ITPDE5; ISSN 0885-8977; TRN: IM9724%%111","10.1109/61.568274","","2009-12-16T00:00:00Z","477234","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/477234","","IEEE Transactions on Power Delivery","1","12"
