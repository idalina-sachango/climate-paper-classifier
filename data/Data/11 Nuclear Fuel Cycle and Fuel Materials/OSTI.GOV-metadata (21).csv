Protons have proven far superior to high energy x-rays for flash radiography because of their long mean free path, good position resolution, and low scatter background. Although this facility is primarily used for studying very fast phenomena such as high explosive driven experiments, it is finding increasing application to other fields, such as tomography of static objects, phase changes in materials and the dynamics of chemical reactions. The advantages of protons are discussed, data from some recent experiments will be reviewed and concepts for new techniques are introduced.","Springer","","Los Alamos National Lab.

"Characterization of the kinetics of NF<sub>3</sub>-fluorination of NpO<sub>2</sub>","Casella, Andrew M.; Scheele, Randall D.; McNamara, Bruce K.","11 NUCLEAR FUEL CYCLE AND FUEL MATERIALS; 37 INORGANIC, ORGANIC, PHYSICAL, AND ANALYTICAL CHEMISTRY","The exploitation of selected actinide and fission product fluoride volatilities has long been considered as a potentially attractive compact method for recycling used nuclear fuels to avoid generating the large volumes of radioactive waste arising from aqueous reprocessing . The most developed process uses the aggressive and hazardous fluorinating agents hydrogen fluoride (HF) and/or molecular fluorine (F<sub>2</sub>) at high temperatures to volatilize the greatest fraction of the used nuclear fuel into a single gas stream. The volatilized fluorides are subsequently separated using a series of fractionation and condensation columns to recover the valuable fuel constituents and fission products. In pursuit of a safer and less complicated approach, we investigated an alternative fluoride volatility-based process using the less hazardous fluorinating agent nitrogen trifluoride (NF<sub>3</sub>) and leveraging its less aggressive nature to selectively evolve fission product and actinide fluorides from the solid phase based on their reaction temperatures into a single recycle stream. In this approach, successive isothermal treatments using NF<sub>3</sub> will first evolve the more thermally susceptible used nuclear fuel constituents leaving the other constituents in the residual solids until subsequent isothermal temperature treatments cause these others to volatilize. During investigation of this process, individual neat used fuel components were treated with isothermal NF<sub>3</sub> in an attempt to characterize the kinetics of each fluorination reaction to provide input into the design of a new volatile fluoride separations approach. In these directed investigations, complex behavior was observed between NF<sub>3</sub> and certain solid reactants such as the actinide oxides of uranium, plutonium, and neptunium. Given the similar thermal reaction susceptibilities of neptunium oxide (NpO<sub>2</sub>) and uranium dioxide (UO<sub>2</sub>) and the importance of Np and U, we initially focused our efforts on determining the reaction kinetic parameters for NpO<sub>2</sub>. Characterizing the NF3 fluorination of NpO<sub>2</sub> using established models for gas-solid reactions [16] proved unsuccessful so we developed a series of successive fundamental reaction mechanisms to characterize the observed successive fluorination reactions leading to production of the volatile neptunium hexafluoride (NpF<sub>6</sub>).","American Institute of Physics (AIP)","","Pacific Northwest National Lab.

"Local measurement of thermal conductivity and diffusivity","Hurley, David H.; Schley, Robert S.; Khafizov, Marat; Wendt, Brycen L.","11 NUCLEAR FUEL CYCLE AND FUEL MATERIALS; thermal conductivity; metallic thin films; dispersion relations; gold; laser materials","Simultaneous measurement of local thermal diffusivity and conductivity is demonstrated on a range of ceramic samples. This was accomplished by measuring the temperature field spatial profile of samples excited by an amplitude modulated continuous wave laser beam. A thin gold film is applied to the samples to ensure strong optical absorption and to establish a second boundary condition that introduces an expression containing the substrate thermal conductivity. The diffusivity and conductivity are obtained by comparing the measured phase profile of the temperature field to a continuum based model. A sensitivity analysis is used to identify the optimal film thickness for extracting the both substrate conductivity and diffusivity. Proof of principle studies were conducted on a range of samples having thermal properties that are representative of current and advanced accident tolerant nuclear fuels. It is shown that by including the Kapitza resistance as an additional fitting parameter, the measured conductivity and diffusivity of all the samples considered agree closely with literature values. Lastly, a distinguishing feature of this technique is that it does not require a priori knowledge of the optical spot size which greatly increases measurement reliability and reproducibility.","American Institute of Physics (AIP)","","Idaho National Lab.

This report describes an investigation of the effects of various factors such as uranium speciation and presence of salts including sodium, calcium, magnesium, and bicarbonate, as well as trace elements such as vanadium on uranium adsorption kinetics in laboratory experiments. Adsorption models are also developed to describe the experimental data of uranium extraction from seawater. Results show that the presence of calcium and magnesium significantly slows down the uranium adsorption kinetics. Vanadium can replace uranium from amidoxime-based adsorbent in the presence of sodium in the solution. Results also show that bicarbonate in the solution strongly competes with amidoxime for binding uranium, and thus slows down the uranium adsorption kinetics. Developed on the basis of the experimental findings, the model is capable of describing the effects of pH, ionic strength, temperature, and concentration of various species. Finally, the results of this work are useful in the understanding of the important factors that control the adsorbent capacity and kinetics of uranium uptake by amidoxime-based adsorbents.","American Chemical Society (ACS)","","Oak Ridge National Lab.

During irradiation, TRISO-coated fuel particles act as a pressure vessel to contain fission gas and mitigate the diffusion of fission products to the coolant boundary. The fuel specifications place limits on key attributes to minimize fuel particle failure under irradiation and postulated accident conditions. PARFUME (an integrated mechanistic coated particle fuel performance code developed at the Idaho National Laboratory) was used to calculate fuel particle failure probabilities. By systematically varying key TRISO-coated particle attributes, failure probability functions were developed to understand how each attribute contributes to fuel particle failure. Critical manufacturing limits were calculated for the key attributes of a low enriched TRISO-coated nuclear fuel particle with a kernel diameter of 425 μm. As a result, these critical manufacturing limits identify ranges beyond where an increase in fuel particle failure probability is expected to occur.","Elsevier","","Idaho National Lab.

Batches of this adsorbent were conditioned with potassium hydroxide (KOH) at room temperature or 80 °C prior to contact with a uranium-spiked seawater simulant, with minimal differences in uptake observed as a function of conditioning temperature. A maximum capacity of 4.81 g-U/kg-ads was obtained following 42 days contact with uranium-spiked filtered environmental seawater, which demonstrates a comparable adsorption rate. A kinetic investigation revealed extremely rapid uranyl uptake, with more than 80% saturation reached within 14 days.

"Measurement and modelling of reactive transport in geological barriers for nuclear waste containment","Xiong, Qingrong; Joseph, Claudia; Schmeide, Katja; Jivkov, Andrey P.","11 NUCLEAR FUEL CYCLE AND RUEL MATERIALS; 38 RADIATION CHEMISTRY, RADIOCHEMISTRY, AND NUCLEAR CHEMISTRY","Compacted clays are considered as excellent candidates for barriers to radionuclide transport in future repositories for nuclear waste due to their very low hydraulic permeability. Diffusion is the dominant transport mechanism, controlled by a nano-scale pore system. Assessment of the clays' long-term containment function requires adequate modelling of such pore systems and their evolution. Existing characterisation techniques do not provide complete pore space information for effective modelling, such as pore and throat size distributions and connectivity. Special network models for reactive transport are proposed here using the complimentary character of the pore space and the solid phase. Here, this balances the insufficient characterisation information and provides the means for future mechanical–physical–chemical coupling. The anisotropy and heterogeneity of clays is represented using different length parameters and percentage of pores in different directions. Resulting networks are described as mathematical graphs with efficient discrete calculus formulation of transport. Opalinus Clay (OPA) is chosen as an example. Experimental data for the tritiated water (HTO) and U(VI) diffusion through OPA are presented. Calculated diffusion coefficients of HTO and uranium species are within the ranges of the experimentally determined data in different clay directions. This verifies the proposed pore network model and validates that uranium complexes are diffusing as neutral species in OPA. In the case of U(VI) diffusion the method is extended to account for sorption and convection. Finally, rather than changing pore radii by coarse grained mathematical formula, physical sorption is simulated in each pore, which is more accurate and realistic.","Royal Society of Chemistry","","Lawrence Livermore National Lab.

"The Multi-Step CADIS method for shutdown dose rate calculations and uncertainty propagation","Ibrahim, Ahmad M.; Peplow, Douglas E.; Grove, Robert E.; Peterson, Joshua L.; Johnson, Seth R.","11 NUCLEAR FUEL CYCLE AND FUEL MATERIALS","Shutdown dose rate (SDDR) analysis requires (a) a neutron transport calculation to estimate neutron flux fields, (b) an activation calculation to compute radionuclide inventories and associated photon sources, and (c) a photon transport calculation to estimate final SDDR. In some applications, accurate full-scale Monte Carlo (MC) SDDR simulations are needed for very large systems with massive amounts of shielding materials. However, these simulations are impractical because calculation of space- and energy-dependent neutron fluxes throughout the structural materials is needed to estimate distribution of radioisotopes causing the SDDR. Biasing the neutron MC calculation using an importance function is not simple because it is difficult to explicitly express the response function, which depends on subsequent computational steps. Furthermore, the typical SDDR calculations do not consider how uncertainties in MC neutron calculation impact SDDR uncertainty, even though MC neutron calculation uncertainties usually dominate SDDR uncertainty.","American Nuclear Society (ANS)","","Oak Ridge National Lab.

"The redox chemistry of neptunium in γ-irradiated aqueous nitric acid in the presence of an organic phase","Mincher, Bruce J.; Precek, Martin; Paulenova, Alena","11 NUCLEAR FUEL CYCLE AND FUEL MATERIALS; neptunium; radiation chemistry; redox chemistry; solvent extraction","The radiolytic changes in oxidation state for solutions of initially Np(V) and/or Np(VI) were investigated by gamma-irradiation in conjunction with UV/Vis spectroscopy of the aqueous phase. Samples were irradiated in varying concentrations of nitric acid, and with or without the presence of 30% TBP in dodecane. At short irradiation times Np(V) was oxidized to Np(VI), even in the presence of the organic phase. Upon the radiolytic production of sufficient amounts of nitrous acid, reduction of Np(VI) to Np(V) occurred in both phases. This was accompanied by stripping of the previously extracted Np(VI). Nitric acid concentrations of 6 M mitigated this reduction.","Springer","","Idaho National Lab.

"Critical processes and parameters in the development of accident tolerant fuels drop-in capsule irradiation tests","Barrett, K. E.; Ellis, K. D.; Glass, C. R.; Roth, G. A.; Teague, M. P.; Johns, J.","11 NUCLEAR FUEL CYCLE AND FUEL MATERIALS; critical processes; accident tolerant fuels","The goal of the Accident Tolerant Fuel (ATF) program is to develop the next generation of Light Water Reactor (LWR) fuels with improved performance, reliability, and safety characteristics during normal operations and accident conditions and with reduced waste generation. An irradiation test series has been defined to assess the performance of proposed ATF concepts under normal LWR operating conditions. The Phase I ATF irradiation test series is planned to be performed as a series of drop-in capsule tests to be irradiated in the Advanced Test Reactor (ATR) operated by the Idaho National Laboratory (INL). Design, analysis, and fabrication processes for ATR drop-in capsule experiment preparation are presented in this paper to demonstrate the importance of special design considerations, parameter sensitivity analysis, and precise fabrication and inspection techniques for figure innovative materials used in ATF experiment assemblies. A Taylor Series Method sensitivity analysis approach was used to identify the most critical variables in cladding and rodlet stress, temperature, and pressure calculations for design analyses. The results showed that internal rodlet pressure calculations are most sensitive to the fission gas release rate uncertainty while temperature calculations are most sensitive to cladding I.D. and O.D. dimensional uncertainty. The analysis showed that stress calculations are most sensitive to rodlet internal pressure uncertainties, however the results also indicated that the inside radius, outside radius, and internal pressure were all magnified as they propagate through the stress equation. This study demonstrates the importance for ATF concept development teams to provide the fabricators as much information as possible about the material properties and behavior observed in prototype testing, mock-up fabrication and assembly, and chemical and mechanical testing of the materials that may have been performed in the concept development phase. Special handling, machining, welding, and inspection of materials, if known, should also be communicated to the experiment fabrication and inspection team.","Elsevier","","Idaho National Lab.

"Uranium vacancy mobility at the Σ5 symmetric tilt and Σ5 twist grain boundaries in UO₂","Uberuaga, Blas Pedro; Andersson, David A.","36 MATERIALS SCIENCE; 11 NUCLEAR FUEL CYCLE AND FUEL MATERIALS; urania; grain boundaries, cation migration, kinetic Monte Carlo","Ionic transport at grain boundaries in oxides dictates a number of important phenomena, from ionic conductivity to sintering to creep. For nuclear fuels, it also influences fission gas bubble nucleation and growth. Here, using a combination of atomistic calculations and object kinetic Monte Carlo (okMC) simulations, we examine the kinetic pathways associated with uranium vacancies at two model grain boundaries in UO<sub>2</sub>. The barriers for vacancy motion were calculated using the nudged elastic band method at all uranium sites at each grain boundary and were used as the basis of the okMC simulations. For both boundaries considered – a simple tilt and a simple twist boundary – the mobility of uranium vacancies is significantly higher than in the bulk. For the tilt boundary, there is clearly preferred migration along the tilt axis as opposed to in the perpendicular direction while, for the twist boundary, migration is essentially isotropic within the boundary plane. These results show that cation defect mobility in fluorite-structured materials is enhanced at certain types of grain boundaries and is dependent on the boundary structure with the tilt boundary exhibiting higher rates of migration than the twist boundary.","Elsevier","","Los Alamos National Lab.

"Advanced multiphysics coupling for LWR fuel performance analysis","Hales, J. D.; Tonks, M. R.; Gleicher, F. N.; Spencer, B. W.; Novascone, S. R.; Williamson, R. L.; Pastore, G.; Perez, D. M.","11 NUCLEAR FUEL CYCLE AND FUEL MATERIALS; Multiphysics; Fuel performance analysis","Even the most basic nuclear fuel analysis is a multiphysics undertaking, as a credible simulation must consider at a minimum coupled heat conduction and mechanical deformation. The need for more realistic fuel modeling under a variety of conditions invariably leads to a desire to include coupling between a more complete set of the physical phenomena influencing fuel behavior, including neutronics, thermal hydraulics, and mechanisms occurring at lower length scales. This paper covers current efforts toward coupled multiphysics LWR fuel modeling in three main areas. The first area covered in this paper concerns thermomechanical coupling. The interaction of these two physics, particularly related to the feedback effect associated with heat transfer and mechanical contact at the fuel/clad gap, provides numerous computational challenges. An outline is provided of an effective approach used to manage the nonlinearities associated with an evolving gap in BISON, a nuclear fuel performance application. A second type of multiphysics coupling described here is that of coupling neutronics with thermomechanical LWR fuel performance. DeCART, a high-fidelity core analysis program based on the method of characteristics, has been coupled to BISON. DeCART provides sub-pin level resolution of the multigroup neutron flux, with resonance treatment, during a depletion or a fast transient simulation. Two-way coupling between these codes was achieved by mapping fission rate density and fast neutron flux fields from DeCART to BISON and the temperature field from BISON to DeCART while employing a Picard iterative algorithm. Finally, the need for multiscale coupling is considered. Fission gas production and evolution significantly impact fuel performance by causing swelling, a reduction in the thermal conductivity, and fission gas release. The mechanisms involved occur at the atomistic and grain scale and are therefore not the domain of a fuel performance code. However, it is possible to use lower length scale models such as those used in the mesoscale MARMOT code to compute average properties, e.g. swelling or thermal conductivity. These may then be used by an engineering-scale model. Examples of this type of multiscale, multiphysics modeling are shown.","Elsevier","","Idaho National Lab.

Solutions of MeTODGA and Me2TODGA in alkane diluents were subjected to 60Co γ-irradiation in the presence and absence of nitric acid and analyzed using LC-MS to determine their rates of radiolytic concentration decrease, as well as to identify radiolysis products. The results of product identification from three different laboratories are compared and found to be in good agreement. The diglycolamide (DGA) concentrations decreased exponentially with increasing absorbed dose. The MeTODGA degradation rate constants (dose constants) were uninfluenced by the presence of nitric acid, but the acid increased the rate of degradation for Me2TODGA. The degradation products formed by irradiation are also initially produced in greater amounts in acid-contacted solution, but products may also be degraded by continued radiolysis. As a result, the identified radiolysis products suggest that the weakest bonds are those in the diglycolamide center of these molecules.","Royal Society of Chemistry","","Idaho National Lab.

The irradiation-induced defect evolution was analyzed by using ion channeling technique. Experiment shows that NiFe is more irradiation-resistant than NiCo and pure Ni at low fluences. With continuously increasing the ion fluences, damage level is eventually saturated for all materials but at different dose levels. The saturation level in pure Ni appears at relatively lower irradiation fluence than the alloys, suggesting that damage accumulation slows down in the alloys. Here, under high-fluence irradiations, pure Ni has wider damage ranges than the alloys, indicating that defects in pure Ni have high mobility.","Elsevier","","Oak Ridge National Lab.

U.","11 NUCLEAR FUEL CYCLE AND FUEL MATERIALS; tritium; humidity-stimulated decontamination; temperature-driven decontamination","The impact of water vapor and temperature on the release of tritium from stainless steel was studied. Degreased stainless steel samples loaded with tritium at room temperature following a 24-h degassing in vacuum at room temperature were subjected to increasing temperatures or humidity. In general, increasing either the sample temperature or the humidity causes an increased quantity of tritium to be removed. Increasing the temperature to 300°C in a dry gas stream results in a significant release of tritium and is therefore an effective means for reducing the tritium inventory in steel. For humid purges at 30°C, a sixfold increase in humidity results in a tenfold increase in the peak outgassing rate. Increasing the humidity from 4 parts per million (ppm) to 1000 ppm when the sample temperature is 100°C causes a significant increase in the tritium outgassing rate. Finally, a simple calculation shows that only 15% of the activity present in the sample was removed in these experiments, suggesting that the surface layer of adsorbed water participates in regulating tritium desorption from the surface.","American Nuclear Society","","University of Rochester, Rochester, NY (United States).

Organically modified mesoporous silica is an efficient material for recovery and potential subsequent separation of actinides and lanthanides because of its high surface area, tunable ligand selection, and chemically robust substrate. Here, we have synthesized the first novel hybrid material composed of SBA-15 type mesoporous silica functionalized with diglycolamide ligands (DGA-SBA). Because of the high surface area substrate, the DGA-SBA was found to have the highest Eu capacity reported so far in the literature of all DGA solid-phase extractants. The sorption behavior of europium and americium on DGA-SBA in nitric and hydrochloric acid media was tested in batch contact experiments. DGA-SBA was found to have high sorption of Am and Eu in pH 1, 1 M, and 3 M nitric and hydrochloric acid concentrations, which makes it promising for sequestration of these metals from used nuclear fuel or legacy waste. The kinetics of Eu sorption were found to be two times slower than that for Am in 1 M HNO<sub>3</sub>. Additionally, the short-term susceptibility of DGA-SBA to degradation in the presence of acid was probed using <sup>29</sup>Si and <sup>13</sup>C solid-state NMR spectroscopy.

"Mixed monofunctional extractants for trivalent actinide/lanthanide separations: TALSPEAK-MME","Johnson, Aaron T.; Nash, Kenneth L.","11 NUCLEAR FUEL CYCLE AND FUEL MATERIALS; ALSPEAK; lanthanide; actinide; solvent extraction; Cyanex 923; HEH[EHP]","The basic features of an f-element extraction process based on a solvent composed of equimolar mixtures of Cyanex-923 (a mixed trialkyl phosphine oxide) and 2-ethylhexylphosphonic acid mono-2-ethylhexyl ester (HEH[EHP]) extractants in n-dodecane are investigated in this report. This system, which combines features of the TRPO and TALSPEAK processes, is based on co-extraction of trivalent lanthanides and actinides from 0.1 to 1.0 M HNO<sub>3</sub> followed by application of a buffered aminopolycarboxylate solution strip to accomplish a Reverse TALSPEAK selective removal of actinides. This mixed-extractant medium could enable a simplified approach to selective trivalent f-element extraction and actinide partitioning in a single process. As compared with other combined process applications in development for more compact actinide partitioning processes (DIAMEX-SANEX, GANEX, TRUSPEAK, ALSEP), this combination features only monofunctional extractants with high solubility limits and comparatively low molar mass. Selective actinide stripping from the loaded extractant phase is done using a glycine-buffered solution containing N-(2-hydroxyethyl)ethylenediaminetriacetic acid (HEDTA) or triethylenetetramine-N,N,N',N'',N''',N'''-hexaacetic acid (TTHA). Lastly, the results reported provide evidence for simplified interactions between the two extractants and demonstrate a pathway toward using mixed monofunctional extractants to separate trivalent actinides (An) from fission product lanthanides (Ln).","Taylor and Francis","","Idaho National Lab.

Two SLM extraction systems were investigated where the membrane was impregnated with either di-(2-ethylhexyl)phosphoric acid (HDEHP) or tributyl phosphate (TBP). A HDEHP impregnated membrane was used to extract neodymium (III), representative of a typical trivalent lanthanide. Cerium, which was oxidized by sodium bismuthate from trivalent to tetravalent state, was extracted by TBP. Oxidized cerium was used as a surrogate for oxidized americium to investigate the kinetics and possibility of americium and curium separation by membrane extraction. Both extraction systems were operated at varying nitric acid concentrations, and changes in the kinetics and extraction efficiency of metal ions were investigated. The proposed transport mechanism that was chosen for our studies was modified from the previous works by Danesi et al.[1,2] and Cussler et al.[3] The mechanism was selected due to the ability to accommodate and describe transport phenomena across a SLM when formation of extractant nano-channels in the membrane may exist. We were able to obtain acceptable fit of the models to our overall data trends although chemical and physical conditions must be well established and purity and homogeneity of the membrane are critical. A reverse transport of metal ions was observed when leaving the system for longer times which agrees with our model. The membrane was investigated for degradation and shown to be stable after contact with up to 7 M nitric acid for over 2000 minutes. Finally, we examined the possibility of partitioning americium from curium using a SLM impregnated by TBP. Separation of americium from curium was observed although not to a degree that was expected based on the Ce(IV) transport. Incomplete oxidation of Am(III) to Am(V) and reduction of Am(VI) on the membrane surface are possible causes for this observed discrepancy. Our model was, however, able to accurately predict Cm(III) transport through the membrane.","Taylor and Francis","","Univ. of California, Irvine, CA (United States)","USDOE Office of Nuclear Energy (NE).

The segregation rate is controlled by diffusion of fission gas atoms through the grains and interaction with the boundaries. Based on the mechanisms established from earlier density functional theory (DFT) and empirical potential calculations, diffusion models for xenon (Xe), uranium (U) vacancies and U interstitials in UO<sub>2</sub> have been derived for both intrinsic (no irradiation) and irradiation conditions. Segregation of Xe to grain boundaries is described by combining the bulk diffusion model with a model for the interaction between Xe atoms and three different grain boundaries in UO<sub>2</sub> (Σ5 tilt, Σ5 twist and a high angle random boundary), as derived from atomistic calculations. The present model does not attempt to capture nucleation or growth of fission gas bubbles at the grain boundaries. The point defect and Xe diffusion and segregation models are implemented in the MARMOT phase field code, which is used to calculate effective Xe and U diffusivities as well as to simulate Xe redistribution for a few simple microstructures.","Elsevier","","Idaho National Lab.

Measurements using transport current determined the pre- and post-irradiation resistivity, critical current density, and pinning force density, yielding critical temperatures, irreversibility lines, and inferred vortex creep rates.

A novel analysis technique called hiRX (high resolution X-ray) has been developed for the direct measurement of Pu in spent nuclear fuel dissolver solutions. hiRX is based on monochromatic wavelength dispersive X-ray fluorescence (MWDXRF), which provides enhanced sensitivity and specificity compared with conventional XRF techniques. A breadboard setup of the hiRX instrument was calibrated using spiked surrogate spent fuel (SSF) standards prepared as dried residues. Samples of actual spent fuel were utilized to evaluate the performance of the hiRX. The direct detection of just 39 ng of Pu is demonstrated. Initial quantitative results, with error of 4–27% and precision of 2% relative standard deviation (RSD), were obtained for spent fuel samples. The limit of detection for Pu (100 s) within an excitation spot of 200 μm diameter was 375 pg. This study demonstrates the potential for the hiRX technique to be utilized for the rapid, accurate, and precise determination of Pu. Moreover, the results highlight the analytical capability of hiRX for other applications requiring sensitive and selective nondestructive analyses.","Elsevier","","Los Alamos National Lab.

Similar to general photothermal reflectance methods, an intensity-modulated heating laser and a constant intensity probe laser are used to determine the surface temperature response under sinusoidal heating. The approach involves fixing the distance between the heating and probe laser spots, recording the phase lag of reflected probe laser intensity with respect to the heating laser frequency modulation, and extracting thermal diffusivity using the phase lag – (frequency)<sup>1/2</sup> relation. The experimental validation is performed on three samples (SiO<sub>2</sub>, CaF<sub>2</sub> and Ge), which have a wide range of thermal diffusivities. The measured thermal diffusivity values agree closely with literature values.

"Unexpected Actinyl Cation-Directed Structural Variation in Neptunyl(VI) A-Type Tri-lacunary Heteropolyoxotungstate Complexes","Berg, John M.; Gaunt, Andrew J.; May, Iain; Pugmire, Alison L.; Reilly, Sean D.; Scott, Brian L.; Wilkerson, Marianne P.","54 ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCES; 37 INORGANIC, ORGANIC, PHYSICAL, AND ANALYTICAL CHEMISTRY; 46 INSTRUMENTATION RELATED TO NUCLEAR SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY; 12 MANAGEMENT OF RADIOACTIVE AND NON-RADIOACTIVE WASTES FROM NUCLEAR FACILITIES; 11 NUCLEAR FUEL CYCLE AND FUEL MATERIALS; 38 RADIATION CHEMISTRY, RADIOCHEMISTRY, AND NUCLEAR CHEMISTRY","A-type tri-lacunary heteropolyoxotungstate anions (e.g., [PW<sub>9</sub>O<sub>34</sub>]<sup>9-</sup>, [AsW<sub>9</sub>O<sub>34</sub>]<sup>9-</sup>, [SiW<sub>9</sub>O<sub>34</sub>]<sup>10-</sup> and [GeW<sub>9</sub>O<sub>34</sub>]<sup>10-</sup>) are multi-dentate oxygen donor ligands that readily form sandwich complexes with actinyl cations ({UO<sub>2</sub>}<sup>2+</sup>, {NpO<sub>2</sub>}<sup>+</sup>, {NpO<sub>2</sub>}<sup>2+</sup> & {PuO<sub>2</sub>}<sup>2+</sup>) in near neutral/slightly alkaline aqueous solutions. Two or three actinyl cations are sandwiched between two trilacunary anions, with additional cations (Na<sup>+</sup>, K<sup>+</sup> or NH<sub>4</sub><sup> +</sup>) also often held within the cluster. Studies thus far have indicated that it is these additional +I cations, rather than the specific actinyl cation, that direct the structural variation in the complexes formed.

"The mobility of Nb in rutile-saturated NaCl- and NaF-bearing aqueous fluids from 1–6.5 GPa and 300–800 °C","Tanis, Elizabeth A.; Simon, Adam; Tschauner, Oliver; Chow, Paul; Xiao, Yuming; Burnley, Pamela; Cline, Christopher J.; Hanchar, John M.; Pettke, Thomas; Shen, Guoyin; Zhao, Yusheng","58 GEOSCIENCES; 11 NUCLEAR FUEL CYCLE AND FUEL MATERIALS; high field strength elements; niobium; synchrotron; hydrothermal diamond anvil cell; subduction; rutile; aqueous fluid","Rutile (TiO<sub>2</sub>) is an important host phase for high field strength elements (HFSE) such as Nb in metamorphic and subduction zone environments. The observed depletion of Nb in arc rocks is often explained by the hypothesis that rutile sequesters HFSE in the subducted slab and overlying sediment, and is chemically inert with respect to aqueous fluids evolved during prograde metamorphism in the forearc to subarc environment. However, field observations of exhumed terranes, and experimental studies, indicate that HFSE may be soluble in complex aqueous fluids at high pressure (i.e., >0.5 GPa) and moderate to high temperature (i.e., >300 °C). In this study, we investigated experimentally the mobility of Nb in NaCl- and NaF-bearing aqueous fluids in equilibrium with Nb-bearing rutile at pressure-temperature conditions applicable to fluid evolution in arc environments. Niobium concentrations in aqueous fluid at rutile saturation were measured directly by using a hydrothermal diamond-anvil cell (HDAC) and synchrotron X-ray fluorescence (SXRF) at 2.1 to 6.5 GPa and 300-500 °C, and indirectly by performing mass loss experiments in a piston-cylinder (PC) apparatus at similar to 1 GPa and 700-800 °C. The concentration of Nb in a 10 wt% NaCl aqueous fluid increases from 6 to 11 mu g/g as temperature increases from 300 to 500 °C, over a pressure range from 2.1 to 2.8 GPa, consistent with a positive temperature dependence. The concentration of Nb in a 20 wt% NaCl aqueous fluid varies from 55 to 150 mu g/g at 300 to 500 °C, over a pressure range from 1.8 to 6.4 GPa; however, there is no discernible temperature or pressure dependence. Here, the Nb concentration in a 4 wt% NaF-bearing aqueous fluid increases from 180 to 910 mu g/g as temperature increases from 300 to 500 °C over the pressure range 2.1 to 6.5 GPa. The data for the F-bearing fluid indicate that the Nb content of the fluid exhibits a dependence on temperature between 300 and 500 °C at ≥ 2 GPa, but there is no observed dependence on pressure. Together, the data demonstrate that the hydrothermal mobility of Nb is strongly controlled by the composition of the fluid, consistent with published data for Ti. At all experimental conditions, however, the concentration of Nb in the fluid is always lower than coexisting rutile, consistent with a role for rutile in moderating the Nb budget of arc rocks.","Mineralogical Society of America","","Univ. of Nevada, Las Vegas, NV (United States)","USDOE National Nuclear Security Administration (NNSA)","Univ Michigan, Earth & Environm Sci, Ann Arbor, MI 48109 USA [Show the Organization-Enhanced name(s)] [ 2 ] Univ Nevada, High Pressure Sci & Engn Ctr, Las Vegas, NV 89154 USA [Show the Organization-Enhanced name(s)] [ 3 ] Univ Nevada, Dept Geosci, Las Vegas, NV 89154 USA [Show the Organization-Enhanced name(s)] [ 4 ] Argonne Natl Lab, Adv Photon Source, HPCAT, Argonne, IL 60439 USA [Show the Organization-Enhanced name(s)] [ 5 ] Mem Univ Newfoundland, Earth Sci, St John, NF A1C 5S7, Canada [Show the Organization-Enhanced name(s)] [ 6 ] Univ Bern, Inst Geol Sci, CH-3012 Bern, Switzerland","United States","2015-07-01T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: American Mineralogist; Journal Volume: 100; Journal Issue: 7","","Medium: ED; Size: p. 1600-1609","","","NA0001982","Journal ID: ISSN 0003-004X","10.2138/am-2015-5031","","2021-07-21T00:00:00Z","1332405","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/1332405","https://www.osti.gov/servlets/purl/1332405","American Mineralogist","7","100"

Using a spontaneous fission source, this method can be utilized to quickly characterize an array of liquid scintillators in terms of crosstalk. The point model theory due to Feynman is corrected to account for these multiple scatterings. Using spectral information measured by the liquid scintillators, fractions of multiple scattering can be estimated, and mass reconstruction of fissile materials under investigation can be improved. Monte Carlo simulations of mono-energetic neutron sources were performed to estimate neutron crosstalk. A californium source in an array of liquid scintillators was modeled to illustrate the improvement of the mass reconstruction.","Elsevier","","Lawrence Livermore National Lab.

In order to study the consolidation behavior via SPS, sintering temperature and dwell time were correlated with microstructure, density, microhardness and shear yield strength of the sintered specimens.

Significant densification occurred at temperatures greater than 950 °C with a relative density higher than 98%. A variety of nanoparticles, some enriched in Fe and Cr oxides and copious nanoparticles smaller than 10 nm with faceted morphology and enriched in La and Ti oxides were observed. After SPS at 950 °C, the number density of Cr–Ti–La–O-enriched nanoclusters with an average radius of 1.5 nm was estimated to be 1.2 × 10<sup>24</sup> m<sup>–3</sup>. The La + Ti:O ratio was close to 1 after SPS at 950 and 1050 °C; however, the number density of nanoclusters decreased at 1050 °C.

These ORIGEN libraries are generated using two-dimensional lattice physics assembly models that include enrichment zoning and cross section data based on ENDF/B-VII.0 evaluations. Using the SCALE depletion sequence, burnup-dependent cross sections are created for selected commercial reactor assembly designs and a representative range of reactor operating conditions, fuel enrichments, and fuel burnup. The burnup dependent cross sections are then interpolated to provide problem-dependent cross sections for ORIGEN, avoiding the need for time-consuming lattice physics calculations. The ORIGEN libraries for MOX assembly designs are validated against destructive radiochemical assay measurements of MOX fuel from the MALIBU international experimental program. This program included measurements of MOX fuel from a 15 × 15 pressurized water reactor assembly and a 9 × 9 boiling water reactor assembly. The ORIGEN MOX libraries are also compared against detailed assembly calculations from the Phase IV-B numerical MOX fuel burnup credit benchmark coordinated by the Nuclear Energy Agency within the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development.

Measurements were made to assess wavespeeds for longitudinal and shear waves in different propagation directions and these were used along with density measurements to compute the longitudinal and shear moduli as well as Young's modulus. All moduli decreased with increasing graphite porosity and these variations could be interpreted using models describing the effect of porosity on material stiffness. Extrapolations for these models to zero porosity were used to infer the moduli for theoretically dense graphite; the results were far below predicted values reported in the literature for fully dense, polycrystalline, isotropic graphite. Differences can be attributed to microcracking in the graphite microstructure. Using models for the effects of microcracking on modulus, estimates for microcrack populations indicate that the number of cracks per unit volume must be much greater than the number of pores per unit volume. Experimental results reported in the literature for irradiated graphites as well as for the stress dependence of graphite modulus are consistent with the influence of microcracking on elastic behavior and could be interpreted using concepts developed here. In conclusion, results in this work for graphite structure- property relationships should allow for more sophisticated characterization of nuclear graphites using ultrasonic methods.","Elsevier","","Oak Ridge National Lab.

In this paper, we report a mechanism for oxygen transport in uranium dioxide (UO<sub>2</sub>) in which the kinetics is mediated by defect clustering dynamics. In particular, the kinetic Monte Carlo (KMC) method has been used to investigate the kinetics of oxygen transport in UO<sub>2</sub> under the condition of creation and annihilation of oxygen vacancies and interstitials as well as oxygen interstitial clustering, with variable offstoichiometry and temperature conditions. It is found that in hypo-stoichiometric UO<sub>2-x</sub>, oxygen transport is well described by the vacancy diffusion mechanism while in hyper-stoichiometric UO<sub>2+x</sub>, oxygen interstitial cluster diffusion contributes significantly to oxygen transport kinetics, particularly at high temperatures and high off-stoichiometry levels. It is also found that diinterstitial clusters and single interstitials play dominant roles in oxygen diffusion while other larger clusters have negligible contributions. However, the formation, coalescence and dissociation of these larger clusters indirectly affects the overall oxygen diffusion due to their interactions with mono and di-interstitials, thus providing a explanation of the experimental observation of saturation or even drop of oxygen diffusivity at high off-stoichiometry.","American Institute of Physics (AIP)","","Energy Frontier Research Centers (EFRC) (United States).

The DGA concentrations decreased exponentially with increasing dose, and the measured degradation rate constants were uninfluenced by the presence or absence of an acidic aqueous phase, or by chemical variations in the alkyl side-chains. The DGA degradation was attributed to reactions of the dodecane radical cation, whose kinetics were measured for TODGA using picosecond electron pulse radiolysis to be k2 = (9.72 ± 1.10) × 109 M-1 s-1.

The active mode calibration of the Uranium Neutron Collar - Light water reactor fuel (UNCL) instrument is normally performed using a non-linear fitting technique. The fitting technique relates the measured neutron coincidence rate (the predictor) to the linear density of <sup>235</sup>U (the response) in order to estimate model parameters of the nonlinear Parte equation, which traditionally is used to model the calibration data. Alternatively, following a simple data transformation, the fitting can also be performed using standard linear fitting methods. This article compares performance of the nonlinear technique to the linear technique, using a range of possible error variance magnitudes in the measured neutron coincidence rate. We develop the required formalism and then apply the traditional (nonlinear) and alternative approaches (linear) to the same experimental and corresponding simulated representative datasets. Here, we find that, in this context, because of the magnitude of the errors in the predictor, it is preferable not to transform to a linear model, and it is preferable not to adjust for the errors in the predictor when inferring the model parameters.","Elsevier","","Los Alamos National Lab.

"Comparison of the PHISICS/RELAP5-3D ring and block model results for phase I of the OECD/NEA MHTGR-350 benchmark","Strydom, G.; Epiney, A. S.; Alfonsi, Andrea; Rabiti, Cristian","11 NUCLEAR FUEL CYCLE AND FUEL MATERIALS; RELAP5-3D; MHTGR-350; OECD; PHISICS","The PHISICS code system has been under development at INL since 2010. It consists of several modules providing improved coupled core simulation capability: INSTANT (3D nodal transport core calculations), MRTAU (depletion and decay heat generation) and modules performing criticality searches, fuel shuffling and generalized perturbation. Coupling of the PHISICS code suite to the thermal hydraulics system code RELAP5-3D was finalized in 2013, and as part of the verification and validation effort the first phase of the OECD/NEA MHTGR-350 Benchmark has now been completed. The theoretical basis and latest development status of the coupled PHISICS/RELAP5-3D tool are described in more detail in a concurrent paper. This paper provides an overview of the OECD/NEA MHTGR-350 Benchmark and presents the results of Exercises 2 and 3 defined for Phase I. Exercise 2 required the modelling of a stand-alone thermal fluids solution at End of Equilibrium Cycle for the Modular High Temperature Reactor (MHTGR). The RELAP5-3D results of four sub-cases are discussed, consisting of various combinations of coolant bypass flows and material thermophysical properties. Exercise 3 required a coupled neutronics and thermal fluids solution, and the PHISICS/RELAP5-3D code suite was used to calculate the results of two sub-cases. The main focus of the paper is a comparison of results obtained with the traditional RELAP5-3D “ring” model approach against a much more detailed model that include kinetics feedback on individual block level and thermal feedbacks on a triangular sub-mesh. The higher fidelity that can be obtained by this “block” model is illustrated with comparison results on the temperature, power density and flux distributions. Furthermore, it is shown that the ring model leads to significantly lower fuel temperatures (up to 10%) when compared with the higher fidelity block model, and that the additional model development and run-time efforts are worth the gains obtained in the improved spatial temperature and flux distributions.","American Nuclear Society (ANS)","","Idaho National Lab.

As planned, the DBFT will demonstrate drilling and construction of two boreholes, one for initial scientific characterization, and the other at a larger diameter such as could be appropriate for waste disposal (the DBFT will not involve radioactive waste). A wide range of geoscience activities is planned for the Characterization Borehole, and an engineering demonstration of test package emplacement and retrieval is planned for the larger Field Test Borehole. Characterization activities will focus on measurements and samples that are important for evaluating the long-term isolation capability of the Deep Borehole Disposal (DBD) concept. Engineering demonstration activities will focus on providing data to evaluate the concept’s operational safety and practicality. Procurement of a scientifically acceptable DBFT site and a site management contractor is now underway. The concept of deep borehole disposal (DBD) for radioactive wastes is not new. It was considered by the National Academy of Science (NAS 1957) for liquid waste, studied in the 1980’s in the U.S. (Woodward–Clyde 1983), and has been evaluated by European waste disposal R&D programs in the past few decades (for example, Grundfelt and Crawford 2014; Grundfelt 2010). Deep injection of wastewater including hazardous wastes is ongoing in the U.S. and regulated by the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA 2001). The DBFT is being conducted with a view to use the DBD concept for future disposal of smaller-quantity, DOE-managed wastes from nuclear weapons production (i.e., Cs/Sr capsules and granular solid wastes). However, the concept may also have broader applicability for nations that have a need to dispose of limited amounts of spent fuel from nuclear power reactors. For such nations the cost for disposing of volumetrically limited waste streams could be lower than mined geologic repositories.","","","Sandia National Lab.

This paper provides an economic assessment of thorium availability by creating cumulative-availability and potential mining-industry cost curves, based on known thorium resources. These tools provide two perspectives on the economic availability of thorium. In the long term, physical quantities of thorium likely will not be a constraint on the development of a thorium fuel cycle. In the medium term, however, thorium supply may be limited by constraints associated with its production as a by-product of rare earth elements and heavy mineral sands. As a result, environmental concerns, social issues, regulation, and technology also present issues for the medium and long term supply of thorium.","Elsevier","","Idaho National Lab.

In this study, we investigate the diffusion couples of Ag and polycrystalline 3C–SiC, as well as Ag and single crystalline 4H–SiC samples before and after irradiation with C<sup>2+</sup> ions. The diffusion couple samples were exposed to temperatures of 1500 °C, 1535 °C, and 1569 °C, and the ensuing diffusion profiles were analyzed by secondary ion mass spectrometry (SIMS). We found that diffusion coefficients calculated from these measurements indicate that Ag diffusion was greatly enhanced by carbon irradiation due to a combined effect of radiation damage on diffusion and the presence of grain boundaries in polycrystalline SiC samples.","Elsevier","","Oak Ridge National Lab.

It has been demonstrated repeatedly in the literature that the success of these materials is due to the amidoxime functional group. While the amidoxime-uranyl chelation mode has been established, a number of essential binding constants remain unclear. This is largely due to the wide range of conflicting pK<sub>a</sub> values that have been reported for the amidoxime functional group in the literature. To resolve this existing controversy we investigated the pK<sub>a</sub> values of the amidoxime functional group using a combination of experimental and computational methods. Experimentally, we used spectroscopic titrations to measure the pK<sub>a</sub> values of representative amidoximes, acetamidoxime and benzamidoxime. Computationally, we report on the performance of several protocols for predicting the pK<sub>a</sub> values of aqueous oxoacids. Calculations carried out at the MP2 or M06-2X levels of theory combined with solvent effects calculated using the SMD model provide the best overall performance with a mean absolute error of 0.33 pK<sub>a</sub> units and 0.35 pK<sub>a</sub> units, respectively, and a root mean square deviation of 0.46 pK<sub>a</sub> units and 0.45 pK<sub>a</sub> units, respectively. Finally, we employ our two best methods to predict the pK<sub>a</sub> values of promising, uncharacterized amidoxime ligands. Hence, our study provides a convenient means for screening suitable amidoxime monomers for future generations of poly(acrylamidoxime) adsorbents used to mine uranium from seawater.","American Chemical Society","","Oak Ridge National Lab.

One example of bottom-up UQ expresses a measurement result as a function of one or more input variables that have associated errors, such as a measured count rate, which individually (or collectively) can be evaluated for impact on the uncertainty in the resulting measured value. In practice, it is often found that top-down UQ exhibits larger error variances than bottom-up UQ because some error sources are present in the fielded assay methods used in top-down UQ that are not present (or not recognized) in the assay studies used in bottom-up UQ One would like better consistency between the two approaches in order to claim understanding of the measurement process. The purpose of this paper is to refine bottom-up uncertainty estimation by using calibration information so that if there are no unknown error sources, the refined bottom-up uncertainty estimate will agree with the top-down uncertainty estimate to within a specified tolerance. Then, in practice, if the top-down uncertainty estimate is larger than the refined bottom-up uncertainty estimate by more than the specified tolerance, there must be omitted sources of error beyond those predicted from calibration uncertainty. The paper develops a refined bottom-up uncertainty approach for four cases of simple linear calibration: (1) inverse regression with negligible error in predictors, (2) inverse regression with non negligible error in predictors, (3) classical regression followed by inversion with negligible error in predictors, and (4) classical regression followed by inversion with non-negligible errors in predictors. Our illustrations are of general interest, but are drawn from our experience with nuclear material assay by non-destructive assay. The main example we use is gamma spectroscopy that applies the enrichment meter principle. Previous papers that ignore error in predictors have shown a tendency for inverse regression to have lower error variance than classical regression followed by inversion. Our paper supports that tendency both with and without error in predictors. Furthermore, the paper shows that calibration parameter estimates using error in predictor methods perform worse than without using error in predictor methods in the case of inverse regression, but perform better than without using error in predictor methods in the case of classical regression followed by inversion. Both inverse and classical regression involve the ratio of dependent random variables; therefore, the assumed error distribution(s) will matter in parameter estimation and in uncertainty calculations. Mainly for that reason, calibration using a single predictor is distinct from simple regression, and it has not been thoroughly treated in the literature, nor in the ISO Guide to the Expression of Uncertainty in Measurements (GUM). This refined approach is based on simulation, because we illustrate that analytical approximations are not adequate when there are, for example, 10 or fewer calibration measurements, which is common in calibration applications, each consisting of measured responses from known quantities.","Elsevier","","Oak Ridge National Lab.

"A novel approach to modeling plate deformations in fluid–structure interactions","Howard, T. K.; Marcum, W. R.; Jones, W. F.","11 NUCLEAR FUEL CYCLE AND FUEL MATERIALS; computational simulations; fluid-structure interactions (FSI)","With the ability of computational power always rising, there is an increased desire to use computational simulations while designing fuel plates. The downside is that multi-physics simulations – or more specifically, fluid-structure interactions (FSI) as addressed in this paper – require a larger amount of computational resources. Current simulations of a single plate can take weeks on a desktop computer, thus requiring the use of multiple servers or a cluster for FSI simulations. While computational fluid dynamic (CFD) codes coupled to computational structural mechanics (CSM) codes can provide a wealth of information regarding flow patterns, there should be some skepticism in whether or not they are the only means of achieving the desired solution, especially considering the parameters of relevance are the onset of plate collapse and the associated fluid channel velocities. The paper provides an alternative approach to solving FSI problem using a 1-D, semi-analytical model derived from first principles. The results are compared and contrasted to the numerical and experimental work performed by Kennedy (Kennedy, et al., 2014).","Elsevier","","Idaho National Lab.

The irradiation performance of the fuel including the extent of fission product release and the evolution of kernel and coating microstructures was evaluated based on detailed examination of the irradiation capsules, the fuel compacts, and individual particles. Fractional release of <sup>110m</sup>Ag from the fuel compacts was often significant, with capsule-average values ranging from 0.01 to 0.38. Analysis of silver release from individual compacts indicated that it was primarily dependent on fuel temperature history. Europium and strontium were released in small amounts through intact coatings, but were found to be significantly retained in the outer pyrocarbon and compact matrix. The capsule-average fractional release from the compacts was 1 × 10<sup>–4</sup> to 5 × 10<sup>–4</sup> for <sup>154</sup>Eu and 8 × 10<sup>–7</sup> to 3 × 10<sup>–5</sup> for <sup>90</sup>Sr. The average <sup>134</sup>Cs fractional release from compacts was <3 × 10<sup>–6</sup> when all particles maintained intact SiC. An estimated four particles out of 2.98 × 10<sup>5</sup> in the experiment experienced partial cesium release due to SiC failure during the irradiation, driving <sup>134</sup>Cs fractional release in two capsules to approximately 10<sup>–5</sup>. Identification and characterization of these particles has provided unprecedented insight into the nature and causes of SiC coating failure in high-quality TRISO fuel. In general, changes in coating morphology were found to be dominated by the behavior of the buffer and inner pyrolytic carbon (IPyC), and infrequently observed SiC layer damage was usually related to cracks in the IPyC. Palladium attack of the SiC layer was relatively minor, except for the particles that released cesium during irradiation, where SiC corrosion was found adjacent to IPyC cracks. In conclusion, palladium, silver, and uranium were found in the SiC layer of irradiated particles, and characterization of these elements within the SiC microstructure is the subject of ongoing focused study.","Elsevier","","Oak Ridge National Lab.

Apart from Ru, the solid fission products all exhibit higher activation energy than Xe. Furthermore, for all solid FPs except Y<sup>3+</sup>, the migration of the FP has lower barrier than the migration of a neighboring U atom, making the latter the rate limiting step for direct migration. An indirect mechanism, consisting of two successive migrations around the FP, is also investigated. The calculated diffusivities show that most solid fission products diffuse with rates similar to U self-diffusion. But, Ru, Ba and Sr exhibit faster diffusion than the other solid FPs, with Ru<sup>3+</sup> and Ru<sup>4+</sup> diffusing even faster than Xe for T < 1200 K.

The goals of this project focused on developing viable non-destructive assay techniques with capabilities to improve an independent verification of spent fuel assembly characteristics. For this purpose, the CIPN instrument combines active and passive neutron interrogation, along with passive gamma-ray measurements, to provide three independent observables. We describe the initial feasibility demonstration of the CIPN instrument, which involved measurements of four pressurized-water-reactor spent fuel assemblies with different levels of burnup and two initial enrichments. The measurements were performed at the Post-Irradiation Examination Facility at the Korea Atomic Energy Institute in the Republic of Korea. The key aim of the demonstration was to evaluate CIPN instrument performance under realistic deployment conditions, with the focus on a detailed assessment of systematic uncertainties that are best evaluated experimentally. The measurements revealed good positioning reproducibility, as well as a high degree of insensitivity of the CIPN instrument's response to irregularities in a radial burnup profile. Systematic uncertainty of individual CIPN instrument signals due to assembly rotation was found to be <4.5%, even for assemblies with fairly extreme gradients in the radial burnup profile. Lastly, these features suggest that the CIPN instrument is capable of providing a good representation of assembly average characteristics, independent of assembly orientation in the instrument.","Elsevier","","Los Alamos National Lab.

"Silicon Carbide as a tritium permeation barrier in tungsten plasma-facing components","Wright, G. M.; Durrett, M. G.; Hoover, K. W.; Kesler, L. A.; Whyte, D. G.","11 NUCLEAR FUEL CYCLE AND FUEL MATERIALS","The control of tritium inventory is of great importance in future fusion reactors, not only from a safety standpoint but also to maximize a reactor’s efficiency. Due to the high mobility of hydrogenic species in tungsten (W) one concern is the loss of tritium from the system via permeation through the tungsten plasma-facing components (PFC). This can lead to loss of tritium through the cooling channels of the wall thereby mandating tritium monitoring and recovery methods for the cooling system of the first wall. The permeated tritium is then out of the fuel cycle and cannot contribute to energy production until it is recovered and recycled into the system. Most work on tritium permeation barriers has been focused at the breeding blanket where tritium is bred to maintain a self-sustaining tritium fuel cycle. Tritium inventory control is critical there as well to maintain a viable tritium breeding ratio, but there is also a great benefit to reducing permeation of tritium through the PFC (e.g. the first wall). This stems from the fact that the rate at which the tritium recycles between the plasma and solute state in the plasma-facing materials is much larger than any other tritium “loop” in the reactor. Here, this work demonstrates that a thin layer of silicon carbide (SiC) can be used in a W PFC to greatly reduce hydrogenic permeation while maintaining structural integrity of the PFC through rapid thermal anneal and thermal cycling tests up to 1023 K.","Elsevier","","Nanohmics, Inc., Austin, TX (United States)","USDOE Office of Science (SC), Engineering & Technology.

"A comparative study on the wear behaviors of cladding candidates for accident-tolerant fuel","Lee, Young-Ho; Byun, Thak Sang","11 NUCLEAR FUEL CYCLE AND FUEL MATERIALS","Accident-tolerant fuels are expected to have considerably longer coping time to respond to the loss of active cooling under severe accidents and, at the same time, have comparable or improved fuel performance during normal operation. The wear resistance of accident tolerant fuels, therefore, needs to be examined to determine the applicability of these cladding candidates to the current operating PWRs because the most common failure of nuclear fuel claddings is still caused by grid-to-rod fretting during normal operations. In this study, reciprocating sliding wear tests on three kinds of cladding candidates for accident-tolerant fuels have been performed to investigate the tribological compatibilities of selfmated cladding candidates and to determine the direct applicability of conventional Zirconium-based alloys as supporting structural materials. The friction coefficients of the cladding candidates are strongly influenced by the test environments and coupled materials. The wear test results under water lubrication conditions indicate that the supporting structural materials for the cladding candidates of accident-tolerant fuels need to be replaced with the same cladding materials instead of using conventional Zirconium-based alloys.","Elsevier","","Pacific Northwest National Lab.

J.","11 NUCLEAR FUEL CYCLE AND FUEL MATERIALS; uranium; pyrite; carbonaceous; in-situ recovery (ISR); post-mining; restoration","© 2014. In-situ recovery (ISR) of uranium (U) from sandstone-type roll-front deposits is a technology that involves the injection of solutions that consist of ground water fortified with oxygen and carbonate to promote the oxidative dissolution of U, which is pumped to recovery facilities located at the surface that capture the dissolved U and recycle the treated water. The ISR process alters the geochemical conditions in the subsurface creating conditions that are more favorable to the migration of uranium and other metals associated with the uranium deposit. There is a lack of clear understanding of the impact of ISR mining on the aquifer and host rocks of the post-mined site and the fate of residual U and other metals within the mined ore zone. We performed detailed petrographic, mineralogical, and geochemical analyses of several samples taken from about 7m of core of the formerly the ISR-mined Smith Ranch-Highland uranium deposit in Wyoming. We show that previously mined cores contain significant residual uranium (U) present as coatings on pyrite and carbonaceous fragments. Coffinite was identified in three samples. Core samples with higher organic (&gt;1wt.%) and clay (&gt;6-17wt.%) contents yielded higher 234U/238U activity ratios (1.0-1.48) than those with lower organic and clay fractions. The ISR mining was inefficient in mobilizing U from the carbonaceous materials, which retained considerable U concentrations (374-11,534ppm). This is in contrast with the deeper part of the ore zone, which was highly depleted in U and had very low 234U/238U activity ratios. This probably is due to greater contact with the lixiviant (leaching solution) during ISR mining. EXAFS analyses performed on grains with the highest U and Fe concentrations reveal that Fe is present in a reduced form as pyrite and U occurs mostly as U(IV) complexed by organic matter or as U(IV) phases of carbonate complexes. Moreover, U-O distances of ~. 2.05. Å were noted, indicating the potential formation of other poorly defined U(IV/VI) species. We also noted a small contribution from U. O at 1.79. Å, which indicates that U is partially oxidized. There is no apparent U-S or U-Fe interaction in any of the U spectra analyzed. However, SEM analysis of thin sections prepared from the same core material reveals surficial U associated with pyrite which is probably a minor fraction of the total U present as thin coatings on the surface of pyrite.Our data show the presence of different structurally variable uranium forms associated with the mined cores. U associated with carbonaceous materials is probably from the original U mobilization that accumulated in the organic matter-rich areas under reducing conditions during shallow burial diagenesis. U associated with pyrite represents a small fraction of the total U and was likely deposited as a result of chemical reduction by pyrite. Our data suggest that areas rich in carbonaceous materials had limited exposure to the lixiviant solution, continue to be reducing, and still hold significant U resources. Because of their limited access to fluid flow, these areas might not contribute significantly to post-mining U release or attenuation. Areas with pyrite that are accessible to fluids seem to be more reactive and could act as reductants and facilitate U reduction and accumulation, limiting its migration.","Elsevier","","Los Alamos National Lab.

"Testing actinide fission yield treatment in CINDER90 for use in MCNP6 burnup calculations","Fensin, Michael Lorne; Umbel, Marissa","11 NUCLEAR FUEL CYCLE AND FUEL MATERIALS; 73 NUCLEAR PHYSICS AND RADIATION PHYSICS; MCNP6; CINDER90; fission yield; burnup","Most of the development of the MCNPX/6 burnup capability focused on features that were applied to the Boltzman transport or used to prepare coefficients for use in CINDER90, with little change to CINDER90 or the CINDER90 data. Though a scheme exists for best solving the coupled Boltzman and Bateman equations, the most significant approximation is that the employed nuclear data are correct and complete. Thus, the CINDER90 library file contains 60 different actinide fission yields encompassing 36 fissionable actinides (thermal, fast, high energy and spontaneous fission). Fission reaction data exists for more than 60 actinides and as a result, fission yield data must be approximated for actinides that do not possess fission yield information. Several types of approximations are used for estimating fission yields for actinides which do not possess explicit fission yield data. The objective of this study is to test whether or not certain approximations of fission yield selection have any impact on predictability of major actinides and fission products. Further we assess which other fission products, available in MCNP6 Tier 3, result in the largest difference in production. Because the CINDER90 library file is in ASCII format and therefore easily amendable, we assess reasons for choosing, as well as compare actinide and major fission product prediction for the H. B. Robinson benchmark for, three separate fission yield selection methods: (1) the current CINDER90 library file method (Base); (2) the element method (Element); and (3) the isobar method (Isobar). Results show that the three methods tested result in similar prediction of major actinides, Tc-99 and Cs-137; however, certain fission products resulted in significantly different production depending on the method of choice.","Elsevier","","Los Alamos National Lab.

The first sample, designated NSR-F-270409-1, was a depleted uranium powder of moderate purity (~1000 μg/g total elemental impurities). The chemical form of the uranium was a compound similar to K<sub>2</sub>(UO<sub>2</sub>)<sub>3</sub>O<sub>4</sub>·4H<sub>2</sub>O. While aliquoting NSR-F-270409-1 for analysis, the body and head of a Tineid moth was discovered in the sample. The second sample, designated NSR-F-270409-2, was also a depleted uranium powder. It was of reasonably high purity (~380 μg/g total elemental impurities). The chemical form of the uranium was primarily UO<sub>3</sub>·2H<sub>2</sub>O, with minor phases of U<sub>3</sub>O<sub>8</sub> and UO<sub>2</sub>. While aliquoting NSR-F-270409-2 for analysis, a metal staple of unknown origin was discovered in the sample. The presence of <sup>236</sup>U and <sup>232</sup>U in both samples indicates that the uranium feed stocks for these samples experienced a neutron flux at some point in their history. The reactor burn-up calculated from the isotopic composition of the uranium is consistent with that of spent fuel from natural uranium (NU) fueled Pu production. These nuclear forensic conclusions allow us to categorically exclude Australia as the origin of the material and greatly reduce the number of candidate sources.","de Gruyter","","Lawrence Livermore National Lab.

A number of experimental results for several different mixing vane options are reported for operation of a 12.5 cm engineering-scale contactor unit. Fewer straight vanes give greater mixing-zone hold-up compared to curved vanes. Quantitative comparison of droplet size distribution also showed a significant decrease in mean diameter for four straight vanes versus eight curved vanes. This set of measurements gives a compelling case for careful consideration of mixing vane geometry when evaluating hydraulic operation and extraction process efficiency of annular centrifugal contactors.","Taylor and Francis","","Argonne National Lab.

The earliest design for this fuel that was investigated via reactor testing was comprised of a nominally U-10Mo fuel foil encased in AA6061 (Al-6061) cladding. For a fuel design to be deemed adequate for final use in a reactor, it must maintain dimensional stability and retain fission products throughout irradiation, which means that there must be good integrity at the fuel foil/cladding interface. To investigate the nature of the fuel/cladding interface for this fuel type after irradiation, fuel plates that were tested in INL's Advanced Test Reactor (ATR) were subsequently characterized using optical metallography, scanning electron microscopy, and transmission electron microscopy. Results of this characterization showed that the fuel/cladding interaction layers present at the U-Mo fuel/AA6061 cladding interface after fabrication became amorphous during irradiation. Up to two main interaction layers, based on composition, could be found at the fuel/cladding interface, depending on location. After irradiation, an Al-rich layer contained very few fission gas bubbles, but did exhibit Xe enrichment near the AA6061 cladding interface. Another layer, which contained more Si, had more observable fission gas bubbles. Adjacent to the AA6061 cladding were Mg-rich precipitates, which was in close proximity to the region where Xe is observed to be enriched. In samples produced using a focused ion beam at the interaction zone/AA6061 cladding interface were possible indications of porosity/debonding, which suggested that the interface in this location is relatively weak.","ASM International","","Idaho National Lab.

However, atom probe analysis of oxides can be accompanied by measurement artifacts caused by laser-material interactions. In this investigation, two technologically relevant oxide materials with the same crystal structure and an anion to cation ratio of 2.00, pure cerium oxide (CeO2) and uranium oxide (UO2) are studied. It was determined that electronic structure, optical properties, heat transfer properties, and oxide stability strongly affect their evaporation behavior, thus altering their measured stoichiometry, with thermal conductance and thermodynamic stability being strong factors.","","","Energy Frontier Research Centers (EFRC) (United States).

Silver behavior was dominated by rapid release of an appreciable fraction of the compact inventory (3–34%) at the beginning of the tests, believed to be from inventory residing in the compact matrix and outer pyrocarbon (OPyC) prior to the safety test. Measurable release of silver from intact particles appears to become apparent only after ~60 h at 1800 °C. The release rate for europium and strontium was nearly constant for 300 h at 1600 °C (reaching maximum values of approximately 2×10⁻³ and 8×10⁻⁴ respectively), and at this temperature the release may be mostly limited to inventory in the compact matrix and OPyC prior to the safety test. The release rate for both elements increased after approximately 120 h at 1800 °C, possibly indicating additional measurable release through the intact particle coatings. Cesium fractional release from particles with intact coatings was <10⁻⁶ after 300 h at 1600 °C or 100 h at 1800 °C, but release from the rare particles that experienced SiC failure during the test could be significant. However, Kr release was still very low for 300 h 1600 °C (<2 × 10⁻⁶). At 1800 °C, krypton release increased noticeably after SiC failure, reflecting transport through the intact outer pyrocarbon layer. Nonetheless, the krypton and cesium release fractions remained less than approximately 10⁻³ after 277 h at 1800 °C.","Elsevier","","Idaho National Lab.

To simulate and evaluate the deformation and burst process of thin-walled cladding, an in-situ testing and evaluation method has been developed on the basis of visual imaging and image analysis techniques. The method uses a specialized optics system consisting of a high-resolution video camera, a light filtering unit, and monochromatic light sources. The in-situ testing is performed using a 50 mm long pressurized thin-walled tubular specimen set in a programmable furnace. As the first application, ten (10) candidate cladding materials for ATF, i.e., five FeCrAl alloys and five nanostructured steels, were tested using the newly developed method, and the time-dependent images were analyzed to produce detailed deformation and burst data such as true hoop stress, strain (creep) rate, and failure stress. Relatively soft FeCrAl alloys deformed and burst below 800 °C, while negligible strain rates were measured for higher strength alloys.","Elsevier","","Oak Ridge National Lab.

T.","11 NUCLEAR FUEL CYCLE AND FUEL MATERIALS; zirconium; iodine; stress corrosion cracking; failure; molecular dynamics; simulation; reactive force field; grain boundary","Iodine-induced stress-corrosion cracking (ISCC), a known failure mode for nuclear fuel cladding, occurs when iodine generated during the irradiation of a nuclear fuel pellet escapes the pellet through diffusion or thermal cracking and chemically interacts with the inner surface of the clad material, inducing a subsequent effect on the cladding’s resistance to mechanical stress. To complement experimental investigations of ISCC, a reactive force field (ReaxFF) compatible with the Zr-I chemical and materials systems has been developed and applied to simulate the impact of iodine exposure on the mechanical strength of the material. The study shows that the material’s resistance to stress (as captured by the yield stress of a high-energy grain boundary) is related to the surface coverage of iodine, with the implication that ISCC is the result of adsorption-enhanced decohesion.","Springer","","Los Alamos National Lab.

The PARFUME model for the AGR-1 experiment used the fuel compact volume average temperature for each of the 620 days of irradiation to calculate the release of silver, cesium, and strontium from a representative particle for a select number of AGR-1 compacts. Post-irradiation examination measurements provided data on release of these fission products from fuel compacts and fuel particles, and retention of silver in the compacts outside of the silicon carbide (SiC) layer. PARFUME-predicted fractional release of silver, cesium, and strontium was determined and compared to the PIE measurements. For silver, comparisons show a trend of over-prediction at low burnup and under-prediction at high burnup. PARFUME has limitations in the modeling of the temporal and spatial distributions of the temperature and burnup across the compacts, which affects the accuracy of its predictions. Nevertheless, the comparisons on silver release lie in the same order of magnitude. Results show an overall over-prediction of the fractional release of cesium by PARFUME. For particles with failed SiC layers, the over-prediction is by a factor of up to 3, corresponding to a potential over-estimation of the diffusivity in uranium oxycarbide (UCO) by a factor of up to 250. For intact particles, whose release is much lower, the over-prediction is by a factor of up to 100, which could be attributed to an over-estimated diffusivity in SiC by about 40% on average. The release of strontium from intact particles is also over-predicted by PARFUME, which also points towards an over-estimated diffusivity of strontium in either SiC or UCO, or possibly both. The measured strontium fractional release from intact particles varied considerably from compact to compact, making it difficult to assess the effective over-estimation of the diffusivities. Moreover, the release of strontium from particles with failed SiC is difficult to observe experimentally due to the release from intact particles, preventing any conclusions to be made on the accuracy or validity of the PARFUME predictions and the modeled diffusivity of strontium in UCO.","Elsevier","","Idaho National Lab.

Compared to the unaged CF8, the aged specimen appeared to have lower rate of damage accumulation. The rate of microstructural evolution under irradiation in the ferrite was significantly lower in the aged specimen than in the unaged.

"Evaluation of coupling approaches for thermomechanical simulations","Novascone, S. R.; Spencer, B. W.; Hales, J. D.; Williamson, R. L.","11 NUCLEAR FUEL CYCLE AND FUEL MATERIALS; 22 GENERAL STUDIES OF NUCLEAR REACTORS; 97 MATHEMATICS AND COMPUTING; coupled multiphysics; fuel performance","Many problems of interest, particularly in the nuclear engineering field, involve coupling between the thermal and mechanical response of an engineered system. The strength of the two-way feedback between the thermal and mechanical solution fields can vary significantly depending on the problem. Contact problems exhibit a particularly high degree of two-way feedback between those fields. This paper describes and demonstrates the application of a flexible simulation environment that permits the solution of coupled physics problems using either a tightly coupled approach or a loosely coupled approach. In the tight coupling approach, Newton iterations include the coupling effects between all physics, while in the loosely coupled approach, the individual physics models are solved independently, and fixed-point iterations are performed until the coupled system is converged. These approaches are applied to simple demonstration problems and to realistic nuclear engineering applications. The demonstration problems consist of single and multi-domain thermomechanics with and without thermal and mechanical contact. Simulations of a reactor pressure vessel under pressurized thermal shock conditions and a simulation of light water reactor fuel are also presented. Here, problems that include thermal and mechanical contact, such as the contact between the fuel and cladding in the fuel simulation, exhibit much stronger two-way feedback between the thermal and mechanical solutions, and as a result, are better solved using a tight coupling strategy.","Elsevier","","Idaho National Lab.

Through the integration of BISON with the DAKOTA software, a sensitivity analysis of the results to selected model parameters is carried out based on UO2 single-pellet simulations covering different power regimes. The parameters are varied within ranges representative of the relative uncertainties and consistent with the information from the open literature. The study leads to an initial quantitative assessment of the uncertainty in fission gas behavior modeling with the parameter characterization presently available. Also, the relative importance of the single parameters is evaluated. Moreover, a sensitivity analysis is carried out based on simulations of a fuel rod irradiation experiment, pointing out a significant impact of the considered uncertainties on the calculated fission gas release and cladding diametral strain. The results of the study indicate that the commonly accepted deviation between calculated and measured fission gas release by a factor of 2 approximately corresponds to the inherent modeling uncertainty at high fission gas release. Nevertheless, higher deviations may be expected for values around 10% and lower. Implications are discussed in terms of directions of research for the improved modeling of fission gas behavior for engineering purposes.","Elsevier","","Idaho National Lab.

Robert; Yamamoto, Takuya; Li, S.; Cole, James I.; Fielding, Randall","36 MATERIALS SCIENCE; 11 NUCLEAR FUEL CYCLE AND FUEL MATERIALS; ferritic; irradiation; cladding; reactor","Tensile test results at 25 and 300 °C on five 9-12Cr tempered martensitic steels and one 14Cr oxide dispersion strengthened alloy, that were side-by side irradiated to 6.5 dpa at 295 °C in the Advanced Test Reactor (ATR), are reported. The engineering stress–strain curves are analyzed to provide true stress–strain constitutive σ(ε) laws for all of these alloys. In the irradiated condition, the σ(ε) fall into categories of: strain softening, nearly perfectly plastic and strain hardening. Increases in yield stress (Δσ<sub>y</sub>) and reductions in uniform strain ductility (e<sub>u</sub>) are observed, where as the latter can be understood in terms of the alloy's σ(ε) behavior. Increases in the average σ(ε) in the range of 0–10% strain are smaller than the corresponding Δσ<sub>y</sub>, and vary more from alloy to alloy. The data are analyzed to establish relations between Δσ<sub>y</sub> and coupled changes in the ultimate stresses as well as the effects of both test temperature and the unirradiated yield stress (σ<sub>yu</sub>). The latter shows that higher σ<sub>yu</sub> correlates with lower Δσ<sub>y</sub>. In five out of six cases the effects of irradiation are generally consistent with previous observations on these alloys. However, the particular heat of the 12Cr HT-9 tempered martensitic steel in this study has a much higher e<sub>u</sub> than observed for earlier heats. The reasons for this improved behavior are not understood and may be microstructural in origin. However, it is noted that the new heat of HT-9, which was procured under modern quality assurance standards, has lower interstitial nitrogen than previous heats. As a result, notably lower interstitial solute contents correlate with improved ductility and homogenous deformation in broadly similar steels.","Elsevier","","Los Alamos National Lab.

AIMS is a novel <em>in situ</em> materials diagnostic technique based on the spectroscopic analysis of nuclear reaction products induced in PFC surfaces using an ~MeV beam of deuterons from a compact linear accelerator in between plasma shots. AIMS measurements of D retention on inner wall PFCs were acquired during diverted and limited plasma operations and during wall conditioning experiments. Intershot measurements demonstrate the local erosion and codeposition of boron films on PFC surfaces with a constant D/B ratio. This is steady with previous results suggesting that D codeposition with boron is insufficient to account for the net retention observed in Alcator C-Mod.

Analysis of in-core fuel performance is required for design and safety evaluations related to almost every aspect of the nuclear fuel cycle. This study presents a methodology for assessing the quality of uranium–molybdenum fuel images and describes image analysis routines designed for the characterization of several important microstructural properties. The analyses are performed in CellProfiler, an open-source program designed to enable biologists without training in computer vision or programming to automatically extract cellular measurements from large image sets. The quality metric scores an image based on three parameters: the illumination gradient across the image, the overall focus of the image, and the fraction of the image that contains scratches. The metric presents the user with the ability to ‘pass’ or ‘fail’ an image based on a reproducible quality score. Passable images may then be characterized through a separate CellProfiler pipeline, which enlists a variety of common image analysis techniques. The results demonstrate the ability to reliably pass or fail images based on the illumination, focus, and scratch fraction of the image, followed by automatic extraction of morphological data with respect to fission gas voids, interaction layers, and grain boundaries. - Graphical abstract: Display Omitted - Highlights: • A technique is developed to score U–10Mo FIB-SEM image quality using CellProfiler. • The pass/fail metric is based on image illumination, focus, and area scratched. • Automated image analysis is performed in pipeline fashion to characterize images. • Fission gas void, interaction layer, and grain boundary coverage data is extracted. • Preliminary characterization results demonstrate consistency of the algorithm.","","Available from http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.matchar.2015.03.034","","","","United States","2015-07-15T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: Materials Characterization; Journal Volume: 105; Other Information: Copyright (c) 2015 Elsevier Science B.V., Amsterdam, The Netherlands, All rights reserved.; Country of input: International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA)","","Medium: X; Size: page(s) 71-81","","","","Journal ID: ISSN 1044-5803; CODEN: MACHEX; PII: S1044-5803(15)00096-0; TRN: US16R2423045927","10.1016/J.MATCHAR.2015.03.034","","2016-05-11T00:00:00Z","22476112","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/22476112","","Materials Characterization","","105"

ZPPR operated at low power for testing nuclear reactor designs. This paper examines the temperature of Pu content ZPPR fuel while it is in storage. Heat is generated in the fuel due to Pu and Am decay and is a concern for possible cladding damage. Damage to the cladding could lead to fuel hydriding and oxidizing. A series of computer simulations were made to determine the range of temperatures potentially occuring in the ZPPR fuel. The maximum calculated fuel temperature is 292°C (558°F). Conservative assumptions in the model intentionally overestimate temperatures. The stored fuel temperatures are dependent on the distribution of fuel in the surrounding storage compartments, the heat generation rate of the fuel, and the orientation of fuel. Direct fuel temperatures could not be measured but storage bin doors, storage sleeve doors, and storage canister temperatures were measured. Comparison of these three temperatures to the calculations indicates that the temperatures calculated with conservative assumptions are, as expected, higher than the actual temperatures. The maximum calculated fuel temperature with the most conservative assumptions is significantly below the fuel failure criterion of 600°C (1,112°F).</p>","Hindawi Publishing Corporation","","Idaho National Lab.

"Phase stability in thermally-aged CASS CF8 under heavy ion irradiation","Li, Meimei; Miller, Michael K.; Chen, Wei-Ying","36 MATERIALS SCIENCE; 11 NUCLEAR FUEL CYCLE AND FUEL MATERIALS","The stability of the microstructure of a cast austenitic stainless steel (CASS), before and after heavy ion irradiation, was investigated by atom probe tomography (APT). A CF8 ferrite-austenite duplex alloy was thermally aged at 400 degrees C for 10,000 h. After this treatment, APT revealed nanometer-sized G-phase precipitates and Fe-rich alpha and Cr-enriched alpha' phase separated regions in the ferrite. The thermally-aged CF8 specimen was irradiated with 1 MeV Kr ions to a fluence of 1.88 x 10(19) ions/m(2) at 400 degrees C. After irradiation, APT analysis revealed a strong spatial/dose dependence of the G-phase precipitates and the alpha-alpha' spinodal decomposition in the ferrite. For the G-phase precipitates, the number density increased and the mean size decreased with increasing dose, and the particle size distribution changed considerably under irradiation. The inverse coarsening process can be described by recoil resolution. The amplitude of the alpha-alpha' spinodal decomposition in the ferrite was apparently reduced after heavy ion irradiation.

To prove the long duration, high burnup, high neutron exposure capability an experiment where the fuel pin was designed with a very large fission gas plenum and very low fuel smeared density (SD). The experiment, X496, operated to only 8.3 at. % burnup because the EBR-II reactor was scheduled for shut-down at that time. Many of the examinations of the fuel pins only funded recently with the resurgence of reactor designs using very high-burnup fuel. The results showed that, despite the low smeared density of 59% the fuel swelled radially to contact the cladding, fission gas release appeared to be slightly higher than demonstrated in conventional 75%SD fuel tests and axial growth was about the same as 75% SD fuel. There were axial positions in some of the fuel pins which showed evidence of fuel restructuring and an absence of fission products with low metaling points and gaseous precursors (Cs and Rb). Lastly, a model to investigate whether these areas may have overheated due to a loss of bond sodium indicates that it is a possible explanation for the fuel restructuring and something to be considered for fuel performance modeling of low SD fuel.","Elsevier","","Idaho National Lab.

However, fundamental studies have revealed undesired aspects of TALSPEAK, such as the significant partitioning of Na<sup>+</sup>, lactic acid, and water into the organic phase, thermodynamically unpredictable pH dependence, and the slow extraction kinetics. In the modified TALSPEAK process, the combination of the aqueous holdback complexant HEDTA (N-(2-hydroxyethyl)ethylenediamine-N,N',N'-triacetic acid) with the extractant HEH[EHP] (2-ethyl(hexyl) phosphonic acid mono-2-ethylhexyl ester) in the organic phase has been found to exhibit a nearly flat pH dependence between 2.5 and 4.5 and more rapid phase transfer kinetics for the heavier lanthanides. To help understand the speciation of Ln<sup>3+</sup> and An<sup>3+</sup> in the modified TALSPEAK, systematic studies are underway on the thermodynamics of major reactions in the HEDTA system under conditions relevant to the process (e.g., higher temperatures). Thermodynamics of the protonation and complexation of HEDTA with Ln<sup>3+</sup> were studied at variable temperatures. Equilibrium constants and enthalpies were determined by a combination of techniques including potentiometry and calorimetry. This paper presents the protonation constants of HEDTA at T = (25 to 70) °C. The potentiometric titrations have demonstrated that, stepwise, the first two protonation constants decrease and the third one slightly increases with the increase of temperature. This trend is in good agreement with the enthalpy of protonation directly determined by calorimetry. The results of NMR analysis further confirm that the first two protonation reactions occur on the diamine nitrogen atoms, while the third protonation reaction occurs on the oxygen of a carboxylate group. These data, in conjunction with the thermodynamic parameters of Ln<sup>3+</sup>/An<sup>3+</sup> complexes with HEDTA at different temperatures, will help to predict the speciation and temperature-dependent behavior of Ln<sup>3+</sup>/An<sup>3+</sup> in the modified TALSPEAK process.","Elsevier","","Idaho National Lab.

One aspect of the fuel development and qualification process is to demonstrate appropriate understanding of the extent of fission product release from the fuel under anticipated service environments. An apparatus capable of heating post-irradiated small-scale samples cut from larger fuel segments according to specified thermal profiles under a controlled atmosphere has been installed into a hot cell. Results show that optimized experimental parameters to investigate fission product release from small samples have been established. Initial measurements conducted on aluminum alloy clad uranium–molybdenum monolithic fuel samples reveal three clear fission gas release events over the temperature range of 30-1000 °C. The mechanisms responsible for these events are discussed, and the results have been compared with available information in the literature.","Elsevier","","Idaho National Lab.

The majority of the data presented is on mock material made with depleted uranium which mimics the x-ray attenuation characteristics of fuel rods while allowing for simpler handling. A range of data is presented including full thickness (5mm diameter) fuel rodlets, reduced thickness (1.8mm) sintering test samples, and pre/post irradiation samples (< 1mm thick). These data were taken on both a white beam (bending magnet) beamline and a high energy, monochromatic beamline. This data shows the utility of a synchrotron type source in the evealuation of manufacturing defects (pre-irradiation) and lays out the case for in situ CT of fuel pellet sintering. Finally, in addition data is shown from small post-irradiation samples and a case is made for post-irradiation CT of larger samples.","Canadian Institute for Non-destructive Evaluation","","Los Alamos National Lab.

"A Full-Core Resonance Self-Shielding Method Using a Continuous-Energy Quasi–One-Dimensional Slowing-Down Solution that Accounts for Temperature-Dependent Fuel Subregions and Resonance Interference","Liu, Yuxuan; Martin, William; Williams, Mark; Kim, Kang-Seog","11 NUCLEAR FUEL CYCLE AND FUEL MATERIALS; 36 MATERIALS SCIENCE","In this paper, a correction-based resonance self-shielding method is developed that allows annular subdivision of the fuel rod. The method performs the conventional iteration of the embedded self-shielding method (ESSM) without subdivision of the fuel to capture the interpin shielding effect. The resultant self-shielded cross sections are modified by correction factors incorporating the intrapin effects of radial variation of the shielded cross section, radial temperature distribution, and resonance interference. A quasi–one-dimensional slowing-down equation is developed to calculate such correction factors. The method is implemented in the DeCART code and compared with the conventional ESSM and subgroup method with benchmark MCNP results. The new method yields substantially improved results for both spatially dependent reaction rates and eigenvalues for typical pressurized water reactor pin cell cases with uniform and nonuniform fuel temperature profiles. Finally, the new method is also proved effective in treating assembly heterogeneity and complex material composition such as mixed oxide fuel, where resonance interference is much more intense.","American Nuclear Society","","Oak Ridge National Lab.

The analysis was performed in the context of a U.S. Department of Energy effort to develop a compendium of informative nuclear fuel cycle performance data. The objective of this paper is to determine whether intermediate spectrum systems, having a majority of fission events occurring with incident neutron energies between 1 eV and 10<sup>5</sup> eV, perform as well as fast spectrum systems in this fuel cycle. The intermediate spectrum options analyzed include tight lattice heavy or light water-cooled reactors, continuously refueled molten salt reactors, and a sodium-cooled reactor with hydride fuel. All options were modeled in reactor physics codes to calculate their lattice physics, spectrum characteristics, and fuel compositions over time. Based on these results, detailed metrics were calculated to compare the fuel cycle performance. These metrics include waste management and resource utilization, and are binned to accommodate uncertainties. In conclusion, the performance of the intermediate systems for this self-sustaining thorium fuel cycle was similar to a representative fast spectrum system. However, the number of fission neutrons emitted per neutron absorbed limits performance in intermediate spectrum systems.","Elsevier","","Oak Ridge National Lab.

For radiochemical applications, including as replacement solvents for nuclear fuel reprocessing, a thorough understanding of the radiation chemistry of ionic liquids will be required. Such an understanding can be achieved based on a combination of steady-state radiolysis experiments coupled with post-irradiation product identification and pulse-radiolysis experiments to acquire kinetic information. These techniques allow for the elucidation of radiolytic mechanisms.

In this fuel design, a thin layer of zirconium is used to eliminate the direct interaction between the U–Mo fuel meat and the aluminum-alloy cladding during irradiation. The co-rolling process used to bond the Zr barrier layer to the U–Mo foil during fabrication alters the microstructure of both the U–10Mo fuel meat and the U–Mo/Zr interface. This work studied the effects of post-rolling annealing treatment on the microstructure of the co-rolled U–Mo fuel meat and the U–Mo/Zr interaction layer. Microscopic characterization shows that the grain size of U–Mo fuel meat increases with the annealing temperature, as expected. The grain sizes were ~9, ~13, and ~20 μm for annealing temperature of 650, 750, and 850 °C, respectively. No abnormal grain growth was observed. The U–Mo/Zr interaction-layer thickness increased with the annealing temperature with an Arrhenius constant for growth of 184 kJ/mole, consistent with a previous diffusion-couple study. The interaction layer thickness was 3.2 ± 0.5 μm, 11.1 ± 2.1 μm, 27.1 ± 0.9 μm for annealing temperature of 650, 750, to 850 °C, respectively. The homogeneity of Mo improves with post rolling annealing temperature and with U–Mo coupon homogenization. The phases in the Zr/U–Mo interaction layer produced by co-rolling, however, differ from those reported in the previous diffusion couple studies.","Elsevier","","Idaho National Lab.

Recently, advanced characterization techniques have been used to examine fuel particles from the Idaho National Laboratory’s AGR-1 experiment. Nano-sized Ag and Pd precipitates were previously identified in grain boundaries and triple points in the SiC layer of irradiated TRISO nuclear fuel. Continuation of this initial research is reported in this paper and consists of the characterization of a relatively large number of nano-sized precipitates in three areas of the SiC layer of a single irradiated TRISO nuclear fuel particle using standardless EDS analysis on focused ion beam-prepared transmission electron microscopy samples. Composition and distribution analyses of these precipitates, which were located on grain boundaries, triple junctions and intragranular precipitates, revealed low levels, generally <10 atomic %, of palladium, silver and/or uranium with palladium being the most common element found. Palladium by itself, or associated with either silver or uranium, was found throughout the SiC layer. A small number of precipitates on grain boundaries and triple junctions were found to contain only silver or silver in association with palladium while uranium was always associated with palladium but never found by itself or in association with silver. Intergranular precipitates containing uranium were found to have migrated ~23 μm along a radial direction through the 35 μm thick SiC coating during the AGR-1 experiment while silver-containing intergranular precipitates were found at depths up to ~24 μm in the SiC layer. Also, Pd-rich, nano-precipitates (~10 nm in diameter), without evidence for the presence of either Ag or U, were revealed in intragranular regions throughout the SiC layer. Because not all grain boundaries and triple junctions contained precipitates with fission products and/or uranium, along with the differences in migration behavior between Pd, Ag and U, it was concluded that crystallographic grain boundary and triple junction parameters likely influence migration behavior.","Elsevier","","Tampere Univ. of Technology (Finland)","USDOE Office of Nuclear Energy (NE)","","United States","2015-05-01T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: Journal of Nuclear Materials; Journal Volume: 460","","Medium: X; Size: p. 97-106","","INL/JOU-14-33248","AC07-05ID14517","Journal ID: ISSN 0022-3115; TRN: US1500049","10.1016/j.jnucmat.2015.02.010","","2015-08-10T00:00:00Z","1177608","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/1177608","","Journal of Nuclear Materials","","460"

Analysis of in-core fuel performance is required for design and safety evaluations related to almost every aspect of the nuclear fuel cycle. This study presents a methodology for assessing the quality of uranium-molybdenum fuel images and describes image analysis routines designed for the characterization of several important microstructural properties. The analyses are performed in CellProfiler, an open-source program designed to enable biologists without training in computer vision or programming to automatically extract cellular measurements from large image sets. The quality metric scores an image based on three parameters: the illumination gradient across the image, the overall focus of the image, and the fraction of the image that contains scratches. The metric presents the user with the ability to ‘pass’ or ‘fail’ an image based on a reproducible quality score. Passable images may then be characterized through a separate CellProfiler pipeline, which enlists a variety of common image analysis techniques. The results demonstrate the ability to reliably pass or fail images based on the illumination, focus, and scratch fraction of the image, followed by automatic extraction of morphological data with respect to fission gas voids, interaction layers, and grain boundaries.","Elsevier","","Idaho National Lab.

Here, we have studied its degradation by exposing dry 1M TBP/n-dodecane solutions to gamma radiation from a cesium-137 source and in a mix of low and high linear energy transfer (LET) radiation by irradiating samples in the UC Irvine TRIGA® reactor and utilizing the <sup>10</sup>B(n,α)<sup>7</sup>Li reaction. In a 1 M solution of TBP in n-dodecane the degradation of TBP (G<sup>-</sup><sub>TBP</sub>) was found to be 0.36 and 0.14 μmol/J for low and high LET radiation, respectively. The formation of dibutyl phosphoric acid, DBP, (G<sup>+</sup><sub>DBP</sub>) in this solution was found to be 0.18 and 0.047 μmol/J for low and high LET radiation, respectively. In samples exposed to low LET as well as a mix of low and high LET a variety of TBP degradation products containing phosphorus were observed indicating that other degradation products than DBP and the monobutyl diacid (MBP) were formed. Our results for both low and high LET radiation compare well with previous studies on these systems indicating that high LET degrades TBP to a lesser extent than gamma radiation. Available data for high LET is not as abundant as for low LET making such comparisons challenging. Nevertheless, our method yields a value for G<sup>+</sup><sub>DBP</sub> that agrees well with previous alpha radiolysis studies indicating that our method shows promise for studying high LET radiolysis in liquid-liquid extraction systems.","Taylor and Francis","","Univ. of California, Irvine, CA (United States)","USDOE Office of Nuclear Energy (NE).

The simplified solution methodology, including a three-equation drift flux formulation and an optimized iteration scheme, yields very fast run times in comparison to conventional thermal-hydraulic systems codes used in the industry, while still retaining sufficient accuracy for applications such as BWR depletion calculations. Lastly, the capability to model advanced BWR fuel designs with part-length fuel rods and heterogeneous axial channel flow geometry has been implemented in PATHS, and the code has been validated against previously benchmarked advanced core simulators as well as BWR plant and experimental data. We describe the modifications to the codes and the results of the validation in this paper.","Taylor & Francis - formerly American Nuclear Society (ANS)","","Oak Ridge National Lab.

"Experimental investigation and CFD analysis on cross flow in the core of PMR200","Lee, Jeong -Hun; Yoon, Su -Jong; Cho, Hyoung -Kyu; Jae, Moosung; Park, Goon -Cherl","11 NUCLEAR FUEL CYCLE AND FUEL MATERIALS; bypass flow; cross flow; PMR2000; VHTR","The Prismatic Modular Reactor (PMR) is one of the major Very High Temperature Reactor (VHTR) concepts, which consists of hexagonal prismatic fuel blocks and reflector blocks made of nuclear gradegraphite. However, the shape of the graphite blocks could be easily changed by neutron damage duringthe reactor operation and the shape change can create gaps between the blocks inducing the bypass flow.In the VHTR core, two types of gaps, a vertical gap and a horizontal gap which are called bypass gap and cross gap, respectively, can be formed. The cross gap complicates the flow field in the reactor core by connecting the coolant channel to the bypass gap and it could lead to a loss of effective coolant flow in the fuel blocks. Thus, a cross flow experimental facility was constructed to investigate the cross flow phenomena in the core of the VHTR and a series of experiments were carried out under varying flow rates and gap sizes. The results of the experiments were compared with CFD (Computational Fluid Dynamics) analysis results in order to verify its prediction capability for the cross flow phenomena. Fairly good agreement was seen between experimental results and CFD predictions and the local characteristics of the cross flow was discussed in detail. Based on the calculation results, pressure loss coefficient across the cross gap was evaluated, which is necessary for the thermo-fluid analysis of the VHTR core using a lumped parameter code.","Elsevier","","Idaho National Lab.

The first high dose ion irradiation experiments on a ferritic-martensitic steel showing that ion irradiation closely emulates the full radiation damage microstructure created in-reactor are described. Ferritic-martensitic alloy HT9 (heat 84425) in the form of a hexagonal fuel bundle duct (ACO-3) accumulated 155 dpa at an average temperature of 443°C in the Fast Flux Test Facility (FFTF). Using invariance theory as a guide, irradiation of the same heat was conducted using self-ions (Fe++) at 5 MeV at a temperature of 460°C and to a dose of 188 displacements per atom. The void swelling was nearly identical between the two irradiation and the size and density of precipitates and loops following ion irradiation are within a factor of two of those for neutron irradiation. The level of agreement across all of the principal microstructure changes between ion and reactor irradiation establishes the capability of tailoring ion irradiation to emulate the reactor-irradiated microstructure.","Elsevier","","Idaho National Lab.

However, GB migration is slowed or even halted by resistive pressure applied by pores or particles. Zener’s original investigation of particle pinning, and subsequent modifications by other researchers, describe the resistive pressure for various spatial distributions of particles with respect to GBs. In this work, we develop a pinning model that considers the impact of the particle size distribution and we verify it by comparing to mesoscale phase field and Monte Carlo simulations. Resistive pressure expressions are developed that are functions of the percentage of GB area covered by particles and of the particle volume fraction for any spatial distribution of particles. In both expressions, the mean value of the resistive pressure decreases with increasing standard deviation of the particle radius.","","","Idaho National Lab.

However, it is known that compositional accuracy can be affected by experimental conditions. A study of the effect of laser energy, specimen base temperature, and detection rate is performed on the evaporation behavior of uranium dioxide (UO<sub>2</sub>). In laser-assisted mode, tip geometry and standing voltage also contribute to the evaporation behavior. In this investigation, it was determined that modifying the detection rate and temperature did not affect the evaporation behavior as significantly as laser energy. It was also determined that three laser evaporation regimes are present in UO<sub>2</sub>. Very low laser energy produces a behavior similar to DC-field evaporation, moderate laser energy produces the desired laser-assisted field evaporation characteristic and high laser energy induces thermal effects, negatively altering the evaporation behavior. The need for UO<sub>2</sub> to be analyzed under moderate laser energies to produce accurate stoichiometry distinguishes it from other oxides. The following experimental conditions providing the best combination of mass resolving power, accurate stoichiometry, and uniform evaporation behavior: 50 K, 10 pJ laser energy, a detection rate of 0.003 atoms per pulse, and a 100 kHz repetition rate.","Elsevier","","Idaho National Lab.

A salient component of that initiative is the conversion of research reactors from HEU to low enriched uranium (LEU) fuels. An innovative fuel is being developed to replace HEU in high-power research reactors. The new LEU fuel is a monolithic fuel made from a U-Mo alloy foil encapsulated in Al-6061 cladding. In order to support the fuel qualification process, the Laser Shockwave Technique (LST) is being developed to characterize the clad-clad and fuel-clad interface strengths in fresh and irradiated fuel plates. LST is a non-contact method that uses lasers for the generation and detection of large amplitude acoustic waves to characterize interfaces in nuclear fuel plates. However, because the deposition of laser energy into the containment layer on a specimen's surface is intractably complex, the shock wave energy is inferred from the surface velocity measured on the backside of the fuel plate and the depth of the impression left on the surface by the high pressure plasma pulse created by the shock laser. To help quantify the stresses generated at the interfaces, a finite element method (FEM) model is being utilized. This paper will report on initial efforts to develop and validate the model by comparing numerical and experimental results for back surface velocities and front surface depressions in a single aluminum plate representative of the fuel cladding.","","","","","","United States","2015-03-31T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","Conference","Journal Name: AIP Conference Proceedings; Journal Volume: 1650; Journal Issue: 1; Conference: 41.

Ion implantation diffusion couples fabricated from single crystal 4H-SiC and polycrystalline 3C-SiC substrates and exposed to 1500–1625°C, were investigated in this study by transmission electron microscopy and secondary ion mass spectrometry (SIMS). The high dynamic range of SIMS allowed for multiple diffusion régimes to be investigated, including enhanced diffusion by implantation-induced defects and grain boundary (GB) diffusion in undamaged SiC. Lastly, estimated diffusion coefficients suggest GB diffusion in bulk SiC does not properly describe the release observed from TRISO fuel.","Elsevier","","Oak Ridge National Lab.

V.","11 NUCLEAR FUEL CYCLE AND FUEL MATERIALS; CONTROL SYSTEMS; DEUTERIUM; ELECTROLYTIC CELLS; FUEL CYCLE; HYDROGEN; ISOTOPE SEPARATION; NUCLEAR FUELS; SIMULATION; TRITIUM; WATER","Hundreds of thousands of tons of tritiated light water have been accumulating from the enterprises of nuclear fuel cycles around the world. The Dual-Temperature Water-Hydrogen (DTWH) process looks like the only practical alternative to Combined Electrolysis and Catalytic Exchange (CECE). In DTWH power-consuming lower reflux device (electrolytic cell) is replaced by a so-called 'hot tower' (LPCE column operating at conditions which ensure relatively small value of elementary separation factor α(hot)). In the upper, cold tower, the tritium transfers from hydrogen to water while in the lower, hot tower - in the opposite direction - from water to hydrogen. The DTWH process is much more complicated compared to CECE; it must be thoroughly computed and strictly controlled by an automatic control system. The use of a simulation code for DTWH is absolutely important. The simulation code EVIO-5 deals with 3 flows inside a column (hydrogen gas, water vapour and liquid water) and 2 simultaneous isotope exchange sub-processes (counter-current phase exchange and co-current catalytic exchange). EVIO-5 takes into account the strong dependence of process performance on given conditions (temperature and pressure). It calculates steady-state isotope concentration profiles considering a full set of reversible exchange reactions between different isotope modifications of water and hydrogen (12 molecular species). So the code can be used for simulation of LPCE column operation for detritiation of hydrogen and water feed, which contains H and D not only at low concentrations but above 10 at.% also. EVIO-5 code is used to model a Tritium Removal Facility with a throughput capacity of about 400 m{sup 3}/day. Simulation results show that a huge amount of wet-proofed catalyst is required (about 6000 m{sup 3}), mainly (90%) in the first stage. One reason for these large expenses (apart from a big scale of the problem itself) is the relatively high tritium separation factor in the hot tower. The introduction of some quantity of deuterium into the gaseous flow before the hot tower lowers the tritium separation factor in that column. One possible variant of deuterium introduction to the hot tower of the first stage was modelled. The decontamination capacity increases by a 2.5 factor.","","Available from doi: http://dx.doi.org/10.13182/FST14-T23","","","","United States","2015-03-15T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","Conference","Journal Name: Fusion Science and Technology; Journal Volume: 67; Journal Issue: 2; Conference: TRITIUM 2013: 10.

Indian Lead Lithium cooled Ceramic Breeder Test Blanket Module (LLCB-TBM) would extract hydrogen isotopes through Cryogenic Molecular Sieve Bed (CMSB) adsorber system. A prototype Hydrogen Isotopes Recovery System (HIRS) is being developed to validate the concepts for tritium extraction by adsorption mass transfer mechanism. In this study, a design model has been developed and analyzed to simulate the adsorption mass transfer kinetics in a fixed bed adsorption column. The simulation leads primarily to effective design of HIRS, which is a state-of-the-art technology. The paper describes the process simulation approach and the results of Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) analysis. The effects of different operating conditions are studied to investigate their influence on the hydrogen isotopes adsorption capacity. The results of the present simulation study would be used to understand the best optimized transport phenomenon before realizing the TES as a system for LLCB-TBM.

MCA requirements are expected for tritium fusion machines and will be dictated by the host country or regulatory body where the machine is operated. Material Balance Areas (MBA) are defined to aid in the tracking and reporting of nuclear material movements and inventories. Material sub-accounts (MSA) are established along with key measurement points (KMP) to further subdivide a MBA to localize and minimize uncertainties in the inventory difference (ID) calculations for tritium accountancy. Fusion systems try to minimize tritium inventory which may require continuous movement of material through the MSA. The ability of making meaningful measurements of these material transfers is described in terms of establishing the MSA structure to perform and reconcile ID calculations. For fusion machines, changes to the traditional ID equation will be discussed which includes breeding, burn-up, and retention of tritium in the fusion device.

"Effect of specimen size and grain orientation on the mechanical and physical properties of NBG-18 nuclear graphite","Vasudevamurthy, G.; Byun, T. S.; Pappano, Pete; Snead, Lance L.; Burchell, Tim D.","36 MATERIALS SCIENCE; 11 NUCLEAR FUEL CYCLE AND FUEL MATERIALS","Here we present a comparison of the measured baseline mechanical and physical properties of with grain (WG) and against grain (AG) non-ASTM size NBG-18 graphite. The objectives of the experiments were twofold: (1) assess the variation in properties with grain orientation; (2) establish a correlation between specimen tensile strength and size. The tensile strength of the smallest sized (4 mm diameter) specimens were about 5% higher than the standard specimens (12 mm diameter) but still within one standard deviation of the ASTM specimen size indicating no significant dependence of strength on specimen size. The thermal expansion coefficient and elastic constants did not show significant dependence on specimen size. Lastly, experimental data indicated that the variation of thermal expansion coefficient and elastic constants were still within 5% between the different grain orientations, confirming the isotropic nature of NBG-18 graphite in physical properties.","Elsevier","","Oak Ridge National Lab.

"Nanostructure of Metallic Particles in Light Water Reactor Used Nuclear Fuel","Buck, Edgar C.; Mausolf, Edward J.; Mcnamara, Bruce K.; Soderquist, Chuck Z.; Schwantes, Jon M.","11 NUCLEAR FUEL CYCLE AND FUEL MATERIALS","The extraordinary nano-structure of metallic particles in light water reactor fuels points to possible high reactivity through increased surface area and a high concentration of high energy defect sites. We have analyzed the metallic epsilon particles from a high burn-up fuel from a boiling water reactor using transmission electron microscopy and have observed a much finer nanostructure in these particles than has been reported previously. The individual round particles that varying in size between ~20 and ~50 nm appear to consist of individual crystallites on the order of 2-3 nm in diameter. It is likely that in-reactor irradiation induce displacement cascades results in the formation of the nano-structure. The composition of these metallic phases is variable yet the structure of the material is consistent with the hexagonal close packed structure of epsilon-ruthenium. These findings suggest that unusual catalytic behavior of these materials might be expected, particularly under accident conditions.","Elsevier","","Pacific Northwest National Lab.

"Recent advances in f-element separations based on a new method for the production of pentavalent americium in acidic solution.","Mincher, Bruce J.; Schmitt, Nicholas C.","11 NUCLEAR FUEL CYCLE AND FUEL MATERIALS; americium; oxidation; solvent extraction; TRUEX","The peroxydisulfate anion has long been used for the preparation of hexavalent americium (AmVI) from the normally stable AmIII valence state in mildly acidic solutions. However, there has been no satisfactory means to directly prepare the pentavalent state (AmV) in that medium. Some early literature reports indicated that the peroxydisulfate oxidation was incomplete, and silver ion catalysis in conjunction with peroxydisulfate became accepted as the means to ensure quantitative generation of AmVI. Incomplete oxidation would be expected to leave residual AmIII, or to produce AmV in treated solutions. However, until recently, the use of peroxydisulfate as an AmV reagent has not been reported. Here, parameters influencing the oxidation were investigated, including peroxydisulfate and acid concentration, temperature, duration of oxidative treatment, and the presence of higher concentrations of other redox active metals such as plutonium. Using optimized conditions determined here, quantitative AmV was prepared in an acidic solution and the UV/Vis extinction coefficients of the AmV 513 nm peak were measured over a range of nitric acid concentrations. The utility of AmV for separations from the lanthanides and curium by solvent extraction, organic column chromatography and inorganic ion exchangers was also investigated.","","","Idaho National Lab.

One concept utilizes U–7 wt.% Mo (U–7Mo) fuel particles dispersed in Al matrix, where the fuel particles are coated with a 1 μm-thick ZrN coating. The ZrN serves as a diffusion barrier to eliminate a deleterious reaction that can occur between U–7Mo and Al when a dispersion fuel is irradiated under aggressive reactor conditions. To investigate the final microstructure of a physically-vapor-deposited ZrN coating in a dispersion fuel plate after it was fabricated using a rolling process, characterization samples were taken from a fuel plate that was fabricated at 500 °C using ZrN-coated U–7Mo particles, Al matrix and AA6061 cladding. Scanning electron and transmission electron microscopy analysis were performed. Data from these analyses will be used to support future microstructural examinations of irradiated fuel plates, in terms of understanding the effects of irradiation on the ZrN microstructure, and to determine the role of diffusion barrier microstructure in eliminating fuel/matrix interactions during irradiation. The as-fabricated coating was determined to be cubic-ZrN (cF8) phase. It exhibited a columnar microstructure comprised of nanometer-sized grains and a region of relatively high porosity, mainly near the Al matrix. Small impurity-containing phases were observed at the U–7Mo/ZrN interface, and no interaction zone was observed at the ZrN/Al interface. The bonding between the U–7Mo and ZrN appeared to be mechanical in nature. A relatively high level of oxygen was observed in the ZrN coating, extending from the Al matrix in the ZrN coating in decreasing concentration. The above microstructural characteristics are discussed in terms of what may be most optimal for a diffusion barrier in a dispersion fuel plate application.","Elsevier","","Idaho National Lab.

Lower length-scale models provide a detailed view of the material behavior that is used to determine the average material response at the macroscale. These lower length-scale calculations may provide insight into material behavior where experimental data is sparse or nonexistent. This multiscale approach is especially useful in the nuclear field, since irradiation experiments are difficult and expensive to conduct. The lower length-scale models complement the experiments by influencing the types of experiments required and by reducing the total number of experiments needed. This multiscale modeling approach is a central motivation in the development of the BISON-MARMOT fuel performance codes at Idaho National Laboratory. These codes seek to provide more accurate and predictive solutions for nuclear fuel behavior. One critical aspect of multiscale modeling is the ability to extract the relevant information from the lower length-scale sim- ulations. One approach, the asymptotic expansion homogenization (AEH) technique, has proven to be an effective method for determining homogenized material parameters. The AEH technique prescribes a system of equations to solve at the microscale that are used to compute homogenized material constants for use at the engineering scale. In this work, we employ AEH to explore the effect of evolving microstructural thermal conductivity and elastic constants on nuclear fuel performance. We show that the AEH approach fits cleanly into the BISON and MARMOT codes and provides a natural, multidimensional homogenization capability.","Elsevier","","Idaho National Lab.

To date, the effective thermal conductivity (ETC) of tristructural-isotropic (TRISO) fuel compacts has not been measured directly. The composite fuel is a complicated structure comprised of layered particles in a graphite matrix. In this work, finite element modeling is used to validate an analytic ETC model for application to the composite fuel material for particle-volume fractions up to 40%. The effect of each individual layer of a TRISO particle is analyzed showing that the overall ETC of the compact is most sensitive to the outer layer constituent. In conjunction with the modeling results, the thermal conductivity of matrix-graphite compacts and the ETC of surrogate TRISO fuel compacts have been successfully measured using a previously developed measurement system. The ETC of the surrogate fuel compacts varies between 50 and 30 W m<sup>-1</sup> K<sup>-1</sup> over a temperature range of 50-600°C. As a result of the numerical modeling and experimental measurements of the fuel compacts, a new model and approach for analyzing the effect of compact constituent materials on ETC is proposed that can estimate the fuel compact ETC with approximately 15-20% more accuracy than the old method. Using the ETC model with measured thermal conductivity of the graphite matrix-only material indicate that, in the composite form, the matrix material has a much greater thermal conductivity, which is attributed to the high anisotropy of graphite thermal conductivity. Therefore, simpler measurements of individual TRISO compact constituents combined with an analytic ETC model, will not provide accurate predictions of overall ETC of the compacts emphasizing the need for measurements of composite, surrogate compacts.","Elsevier","","Idaho National Lab.

Research reactor fuels are designed for efficient heat rejection, and are composed of assemblies of thin-plates clad in aluminum alloy. The development of low-enriched fuels to replace high-enriched fuels for these reactors requires a substantially increased uranium density in the fuel to offset the decrease in enrichment. Very few fuel phases have been identified that have the required combination of very-high uranium density and stable fuel behavior at high burnup. UMo alloys represent the best known tradeoff in these properties. Testing of aluminum matrix U-Mo aluminum matrix dispersion fuel revealed a pattern of breakaway swelling behavior at intermediate burnup, related to the formation of a molybdenum stabilized high aluminum intermetallic phase that forms during irradiation. In the case of monolithic fuel, this issue was addressed by eliminating, as much as possible, the interfacial area between U-Mo and aluminum. Based on scoping irradiation test data, a fuel plate system composed of solid U-10Mo fuel meat, a zirconium diffusion barrier, and Al6061 cladding was selected for development. Developmental testing of this fuel system indicates that it meets core criteria for fuel qualification, including stable and predictable swelling behavior, mechanical integrity to high burnup, and geometric stability. In addition, the fuel exhibits robust behavior during power-cooling mismatch events under irradiation at high power.","","","Idaho National Lab.

Isotopic and impurity content, phase composition, microstructure and other characteristics were measured on the seized sample, and the results were compared with similar material obtained from the suspected source (ore and ore concentrate material). While an extensive range of parameters were measured, the key ‘nuclear forensic signatures’ used to identify the material were the U isotopic composition, Pb and Sr isotope ratios, and the rare earth element pattern. These measurements, in combination with statistical analysis of the elemental and isotopic content of the material against a database of uranium ore concentrates sourced from mines located worldwide, led to the conclusion that the seized material (a uranium ore concentrate of natural isotopic abundance) most likely originated from Mary Kathleen, a former Australian uranium mine.","Elsevier","","Lawrence Livermore National Lab.

Collisions between fission fragments and their subsequent cascades can knock fission gas atoms out of bubbles and back into the fuel lattice. We showed that these collisions can be treated as using the so-called ‘‘homogenous’’ atom-by-atom re-solution theory and calculated using the Binary Collision Approximation code 3DOT. The calculations showed that there is a decrease in the re-solution parameter as bubble radius increases until about 50 nm, at which the re-solution parameter stays nearly constant. Furthermore, our model shows ion cascades created in the fuel result in many more implanted fission gas atoms than collisions directly with fission fragments.

Nondestructive assay (NDA) techniques are commonly used for safeguards inspections to ensure accountancy of declared nuclear materials. Common NDA techniques used include gamma-ray spectrometry and both passive and active neutron measurements. In the present study, neutron spectrometry was investigated for verification of UF<sub>6</sub> enrichment in 30B storage cylinders based on an unattended and passive measurement approach. MCNP5 and Geant4 simulated neutron spectra, for selected UF<sub>6</sub> enrichments and filling profiles, were used in the investigation. The simulated neutron spectra were analyzed using principal component analysis (PCA). The PCA technique is a well-established technique and has a wide area of application including feature analysis, outlier detection, and gamma-ray spectral analysis. Results obtained demonstrate that neutron spectrometry supported by spectral feature analysis has potential for assaying UF<sub>6</sub> enrichment in storage cylinders. Thus the results from the present study also showed that difficulties associated with the UF<sub>6</sub> filling profile and observed in other unattended passive neutron measurements can possibly be overcome using the approach presented.","Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers (IEEE)","","Sandia National Lab.

In this work, a specialized simulation tool was developed for the optimization of a Compton camera through realistic Monte Carlo simulations. This tool can be used for Compton cameras with different geometries. The MCNPX-PoliMi code was used to simulate Compton scatters and photoelectric absorptions in the camera's detectors. The imaging capability is derived from the physics of Compton scattering and the full-energy information obtained in photoelectric absorptions. The simulated system is a 1 1 m2 Compton camera consisting of two planar arrays of photon detectors. Several scintillators were evaluated: LaBr3, CaF2, and NaI(Tl) (all inorganic scintillators), and C9H10 (plastic organic scintillator). The investigation was carried out with a 137Cs source. A minimum detectable activity (MDA) was defined and used to assess the performance of cameras based on different detectors. The simulation results show that C9H10 is a reliable, low-cost, scatter-plane material, increasing the MDA by ~0.2 mCi when compared to a CaF2 scatter plane. On the other hand, the intrinsic background of LaBr3 undermines its above-average energy resolution as the MDA increased by ~0.5 mCi when compared to a NaI(Tl) absorption plane.","Elsevier","","Univ. of Michigan, Ann Arbor, MI (United States)","USDOE National Nuclear Security Administration (NNSA), Office of Nonproliferation and Verification Research and Development (NA-22)","","United States","2015-01-05T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: Progress in Nuclear Energy; Journal Volume: 81; Journal Issue: C","","Medium: ED; Size: p. 127-133","","","NA0002534","Journal ID: ISSN 0149-1970; PII: S014919701500013X","10.1016/j.pnucene.2015.01.009","","2020-04-28T00:00:00Z","1365721","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/1365721","https://www.osti.gov/servlets/purl/1365721","Progress in Nuclear Energy","C","81"

The defect structures were analyzed after the systems were fully relaxed. The states of the self-interstitial atoms (SIAs) were categorized into various types of dumbbells, the crowdion, and the octahedral interstitial.

The application of Zr barrier to the U-Mo fuel requires co-rolling process that utilizes a soaking temperature of 650°C, which represents the highest temperature the fuel system is exposed to during both fuel manufacturing and reactor application. Therefore, in this study, development of phase constituents, microstructure and diffusion kinetics of U-10wt.%Mo and Zr was examined using solid-to-solid diffusion couples annealed at 650°C for 240, 480 and 720 hours.

Twenty-one data points of primary knock-on atom (PKA) energies ranging from 100 eV (sub-threshold energy) to 100 key (similar to 780 x E<sub>d</sub>, where E<sub>d</sub> = 128 eV is the average displacement threshold energy) have been completed at 300 K, 1025 K and 2050 K. Within this range of PKA energies, two regimes of power-law energy-dependence of the defect production are observed. A distinct power-law exponent characterizes the number of Frenkel pairs produced within each regime. The two regimes intersect at a transition energy which occurs at approximately 250 x E<sub>d</sub>. The transition energy also marks the onset of the formation of large self-interstitial atom (SIA) clusters (size 14 or more). The observed defect clustering behavior is asymmetric, with SIA clustering increasing with temperature, while the vacancy clustering decreases. This asymmetry increases with temperature such that at 2050 K (similar to 0.5T<sub>m</sub>) practically no large vacancy clusters are formed, meanwhile large SIA clusters appear in all simulations. The implication of such asymmetry on the long-term defect survival and damage accumulation is discussed. Additionally, [1 0 0]{1 1 0} SIA loops are observed to form directly in the highest energy cascades, while vacancy [1 0 0] loops are observed to form at the lowest temperature and highest PKA energies, although the appearance of both the vacancy and SIA loops with Burgers vector of [1 0 0] type is relatively rare.","Elsevier","","Oak Ridge National Lab.

The results of experimental studies of uranium and cesium penetration into the single-crystal cladding of fuel elements with a carbonitride fuel are interpreted. Those fuel elements passed nuclear power tests in the Ya-82 pilot plant for 8300 h at a temperature of about 1500°C. It is shown that the diffusion coefficients for uranium diffusion into the cladding are virtually coincident with the diffusion coefficients measured earlier for uranium diffusion into polycrystalline molybdenum. It is found that the penetration of uranium into the cladding is likely to occur only in the case of a direct contact between the cladding and fuel. The experimentally observed nonmonotonic uranium-concentration profiles are explained in terms of predominant uranium diffusion along grain boundaries. It is shown that a substantially nonmonotonic behavior observed in our experiment for the uranium-concentration profile may be explained by the presence of a polycrystalline structure of the cladding in the surface region from its inner side. The diffusion coefficient is estimated for the grain-boundary diffusion of uranium. The diffusion coefficients for cesium are estimated on the basis of experimental data obtained in the present study.","","","","","","United States","2014-12-15T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: Physics of Atomic Nuclei; Journal Volume: 77; Journal Issue: 14; Other Information: Copyright (c) 2014 Pleiades Publishing, Ltd.; Country of input: International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA)","","Medium: X; Size: page(s) 1685-1691","","","","Journal ID: ISSN 1063-7788; CODEN: PANUEO; TRN: US15K0021020907","10.1134/S1063778814140105","","2015-03-03T00:00:00Z","22314709","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/22314709","","Physics of Atomic Nuclei","14","77"

Fabrication of UN in its microspherical form also has its own merits since the advent of the concept of accident-tolerant fuel, where UN is being considered as a potential fuel in the form of TRISO particles. But, not many processes have been well established to synthesize kernels of UN. Therefore, a process for synthesis of microspherical UN with a minimum amount of carbon is discussed herein. First, a series of single-phased microspheres of uranium sesquinitride (U<sub>2</sub>N<sub>3</sub>) were synthesized by nitridation of UO<sub>2</sub>+C microspheres at a few different temperatures. Resulting microspheres were of low-density U<sub>2</sub>N<sub>3</sub> and decomposed into low-density UN. The variation of density of the synthesized sesquinitrides as a function of its chemical composition indicated the presence of extra (interstitial) nitrogen atoms corresponding to its hyperstoichiometry, which is normally indicated as α-U<sub>2</sub>N<sub>3</sub>. Average grain sizes of both U<sub>2</sub>N<sub>3</sub> and UN varied in a range of 1–2.5 μm. In addition, these had a considerably large amount of pore spacing, indicating the potential sinterability of UN toward its use as a nuclear fuel.","American Chemical Society (ACS)","","Oak Ridge National Lab.

Fission fragments may also self-transfer, and sources made by self-transfer may need some decay time to reach radioactive equilibrium.","Elsevier","","Oak Ridge National Lab.

Post-irradiation samples were analyzed for the radiolytically-induced decrease in CMPO concentration, the appearance of degradation products, and their Am solvent extraction distribution ratios. The –G CMPO-value for the radiolytic degradation of CMPO was found to be very low compared to values previously reported for ?-irradiation. Additionally, isotopic irradiation to absorbed a-doses as high as 600 kGy in aerated solution had no effect on Am solvent extraction or stripping. The main CMPO radiolysis products identified in He-ion beam irradiated samples by ESI-MS include amides, an acidic amide, and amines produced by bond rupture on either side of the CMPO carbonyl group. Deaerated samples irradiated using the reactor in the absence of an aqueous phase, or with a dilute nitric acid aqueous phase showed small but measurable decreases in CMPO concentration with increasing absorbed doses. Higher concentrations of nitric acid resulted in lower decomposition rates for the CMPO. The radio-protection by dissolved oxygen and nitric acid previously found for ?-irradiated CMPO also occurs for a-irradiation. This suggests that similar free-radical mechanisms operate in the high-LET system, but with lower degradation yields due to the lower overall radical concentrations produced.","Taylor and Francis","","Idaho National Lab.

"Sensitivity Analysis and Data Assimilation in a Subcritical Plutonium Metal Benchmark","Evans, Richard T.; Mattingly, John K.; Cacuci, Dan G.","11 NUCLEAR FUEL CYCLE AND FUEL MATERIALS","Here, this work presents the application of first-order adjoint sensitivity analysis, uncertainty quantification, and data assimilation to a subcritical plutonium benchmark experiment using a modified version of the discrete ordinates radiation transport code Denovo. Previous Monte Carlo simulations of this benchmark saw a consistent overprediction of the mean and variance of the measured neutron multiplicity distribution. It was observed that a small scalar reduction in the value of the <sup>239</sup>Pu-induced fission neutron multiplicity was capable of significantly reducing the discrepancies. This work extends those results by computing first-order sensitivities to each nuclide, reaction type, energy, and material region in the benchmark. The sensitivities are then used in a data assimilationmethodology to simultaneously calibrate all responses and multigroup nuclear data. The resulting best-estimate values for the energy group differential multiplicity $\bar{v}$(E<sub>g</sub>) are 1σ to 2σ less than the nominal values found in ENDF/B-VII for energies less than 1.5 MeV.","Taylor & Francis","","North Carolina State Univ., Raleigh, NC (United States)","USDOE National Nuclear Security Administration (NNSA), Office of Nonproliferation and Verification Research and Development (NA-22); National Science Foundation (NSF)","","United States","2014-03-22T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: Nuclear Science and Engineering; Journal Volume: 176; Journal Issue: 3","","Medium: X; Size: p. 325-338","","","NA0000362; OCI-1053575","Journal ID: ISSN 0029-5639","10.13182/NSE13-24","","2023-02-22T00:00:00Z","1435964","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/1435964","","Nuclear Science and Engineering","3","176"

Models long ago predicted that these precipitates, which are not treated in current embrittlement regulations, would emerge only at high fluence. However, the mechanisms and variables that control Ni-Mn- Si precipitate formation, and their detailed characteristics, have not been well understood. High flux irradiations of six steels with systematic variations in Cu and Ni were carried out at ˜ 295±5°C to high and very high neutron fluences of ˜ 1.3x1020 and 1.1x1021 n/cm2. Atom probe tomography (APT) shows that significant mole fractions of these precipitates form in the Cu bearing steels at ˜ 1.3x1020 n/cm2, while they are only beginning to develop in Cu-free steels. However, large mole fractions, far in excess of those found in previous studies, are observed at 1.1x1021 n/cm2 at all Cu levels. The precipitates diffract, and in one case are compositionally and structurally consistent with the Mn6Ni16Si7 G-phase. At the highest fluence, the large precipitate mole fractions primarily depend on the steel Ni content, rather than Cu, and lead to enormous strength increases up to about 700 MPa. The implications of these results to light water reactor life extension are discussed briefly.","","","Idaho National Lab.

While a large fraction of the fuel grains is decorated with large bubbles, there is no evidence showing interlinking of these large bubbles at the specified fission density. The attachment of solid fission product precipitates to the bubbles is likely the result of fission product diffusion into these bubbles. The process of fission gas bubble superlattice collapse appears through bubble coalescence.

Recent computational studies have identified that differences in grain boundary structure have a significant effect on the segregation behavior of fission products. However, experimental work supporting these simulations is lacking. Atom probe tomography was used to measure the Kr distribution across grain boundaries in UO<sub>2</sub>. Polycrystalline depleted-UO<sub>2</sub> samples was irradiated with 0.7 and 1.8 MeV Kr-ions and annealed to 1000ºC, 1300ºC, and 1600°C for 1 hour to produce a Kr-bubble dominated microstructure. The results of this work indicate a strong dependence of Kr concentration as a function of grain boundary structure. Temperature also influences grain boundary chemistry with greater Kr concentration evident at higher temperatures, resulting in a reduced Kr concentration in the bulk. While Kr migration is active at elevated temperatures, no changes in grain size or texture were observed in the irradiated UO<sub>2</sub> samples.","Springer","","Idaho National Lab.

Stability constants for successive nitrato complexes (M(NO3)x3-x (aq) where M is Eu3+, Am3+ or Cm3+) were determined to assist in the calculation of the extraction constant, Kex, for the metal ions under study. Enthalpies of extraction (?Hextr) for the lanthanide series (excluding Pm3+) and Am3+ by TOPO have been measured using isothermal titration calorimetry. The observed ?Hextr were found to be constant at ~29 kJ mol-1across the series from La3+-Er3+, with a slight decrease observed from Tm3+-Lu3+. These heats were found to be consistent with enthalpies determined using van ’t Hoff analysis of temperature dependent extraction studies. A complete set of thermodynamic parameters (?G, ?H, ?S) was calculated for Eu(NO3)3, Am(NO3)3 and Cm(NO3)3 extraction by TOPO and Am3+ and Cm3+ extraction by bis(2-ethylhexyl) phosphoric acid (HDEHP). A discussion comparing the energetics of these systems is offered.

Kyle; Poitrasson-Riviere, Alexis; Klemm, Dietrich D.; Flaska, Marek; Clarke, Shaun D.; Pozzi, Sara A.; Tomanin, Alice; Peerani, Paolo","11 NUCLEAR FUEL CYCLE AND FUEL MATERIALS","A dual-particle imager with sensitivity to both neutrons and photons has been developed for the detection of special nuclear material. This system has the capability to provide spectral information on detected sources that is useful for safeguard applications. In nuclear facilities with high photon background rates, neutron detection can aid in identification and verification capabilities. The dual-particle imager creates a reconstructed neutron spectrum by correlating neutron counts in pairs of liquid scintillators. The reconstructed spectrum, a combination of energy deposited and time-of-flight, contains resolution effects that blur the true, emitted source-spectrum. To reduce the impact of resolution effects, the reconstructed spectrum can be unfolded to create an estimated source spectrum. A statistical technique, maximum-likelihood expectation-maximization, has been shown to produce an unfolded result for Cf-252 and Am-Be. This technique requires a system response-matrix that contains reconstructed spectra for single neutron energies. Since measuring mono-energetic neutrons is difficult, the system-response-matrix is simulated. Monte Carlo modeling with MCNPX-PoliMi has been show to produce an accurate system response. This work expands on previous neutron unfolding results by showing results for mixed-oxide fuel and plutonium metal measured with the dual-particle imager. Furthermore these results also demonstrate the ability of the dual-particle imager to discrimination between spontaneous fission neutrons and (α,n) reaction neutrons.","IEEE","","Univ. of Michigan, Ann Arbor, MI (United States)","USDOE National Nuclear Security Administration (NNSA), Office of Nonproliferation and Verification Research and Development (NA-22)","","United States","2014-11-01T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: Nuclear Science Symposium and Medical Imaging Conference record; Journal Volume: 2014; Conference: 2014 IEEE Nuclear Science Symposium and Medical Imaging Conference (NSS/MIC), Seattle, WA (United States), 8-15 Nov 2014; Related Information: ISBN 978-1-4799-6097-2","","Medium: ED; Size: p. 1-5","","","NA0002481; NA0002534; NE0000324","Journal ID: ISSN 1091-0026; TRN: US2102021","10.1109/NSSMIC.2014.7431257","","2021-04-12T00:00:00Z","1582004","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/1582004","https://www.osti.gov/servlets/purl/1582004","Nuclear Science Symposium and Medical Imaging Conference record","","2014"

J.; Dennis, B.; Meldrum, A.; Pozzi, S. A.","11 NUCLEAR FUEL CYCLE AND FUEL MATERIALS","Simulations of neutron multiplicity measurements of a highly multiplicative plutonium sphere measured with a moderated array of <sup>3</sup>He proportional counters have consistently overpredicted the mean and variance of the measured multiplicity distribution. In contrast, identical experiments using a <sup>252</sup>Cf source have been accurately simulated. This paper outlines a sensitivity analysis of several key parameters that could account for the overprediction in the simulation of the plutonium sphere. Parameters that were analyzed include source-detector distance, detector dead time, variations in density and volume of the plutonium, and the value of v for <sup>239</sup>Pu-induced fission. Of these parameters, the only factor that accounted for the overprediction within reasonable bounds was a change in the value of the <sup>239</sup>Pu $\bar{v}$ . The sensitivity analysis showed that a small change (1.14% reduction) in the value of $\bar{v}$ dramatically improved the simulated results.","Taylor & Francis","","North Carolina State Univ., Raleigh, NC (United States)","USDOE National Nuclear Security Administration (NNSA), Office of Nonproliferation and Verification Research and Development (NA-22); USDOD","","United States","2014-02-01T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: Nuclear Science and Engineering; Journal Volume: 176; Journal Issue: 2","","Medium: X; Size: p. 167-185","","","NA0000362","Journal ID: ISSN 0029-5639","10.13182/NSE12-53","","2023-02-22T00:00:00Z","1435962","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/1435962","","Nuclear Science and Engineering","2","176"

A primary issue with TRISO fuel operation is the observed release of 110m Ag from intact fuel particles. The release of Ag has prompted research efforts to directly measure the transport mechanism of Ag in bulk SiC. Recent research efforts have focused primarily on Ag ion implantation designs. The effect of the thermal exposure system on the ion implantation surface has been investigated. Results indicate the utilization of a mated sample geometry and the establishment of a static thermal exposure environment is critical to maintaining an intact surface for diffusion analysis. In conclusion, the nature of the implantation surface and its potential role in Ag diffusion analysis are discussed.","Elsevier","","Oak Ridge National Lab.

The dislocation evolution in the grain interior of polycrystalline UO2 was similar under Kr irradiation at different ion energies and temperatures. As expected, it was characterized by the nucleation and growth of dislocation loops at low irradiation doses, followed by transformation to extended dislocation lines and tangles at high doses. For the first time, a dislocation-denuded zone was observed near a grain boundary in the 1-MeV Kr-irradiated UO2 sample at 800C. The denuded zone in the vicinity of grain boundary was not found when the irradiation temperature was at 600C. The suppression of dislocation loop formation near the boundary is likely due to the enhanced interstitial diffusion toward grain boundary at the high temperature.","","","Idaho National Lab.

The DEM model clearly predicts realistic early-life crack patterns including both radial cracks and circumferential cracks. Simulation results clearly demonstrate the formation of radial cracks during the initial power rise, and formation of circumferential cracks as the power is ramped down. In these simulations, additional early-life power cycles do not lead to the formation of new thermal cracks. They do, however clearly indicate changes in the apertures of thermal cracks during later power cycles due to thermal expansion and shrinkage. The number of radial cracks increases with increasing power, which is consistent with the experimental observations.","","","Idaho National Lab.

"A cellular automaton method to simulate the microstructure and evolution of low-enriched uranium (LEU) U–Mo/Al dispersion type fuel plates","Drera, Saleem S.; Hofman, Gerard L.; Kee, Robert J.; King, Jeffrey C.","11 NUCLEAR FUEL CYCLE AND FUEL MATERIALS","Low-enriched uranium (LEU) fuel plates for high power materials test reactors (MTR) are composed of nominally spherical uranium-molybdenum (U-Mo) particles within an aluminum matrix. Fresh U-Mo particles typically range between 10 and 100 mu m in diameter, with particle volume fractions up to 50%. As the fuel ages, reaction-diffusion processes cause the formation and growth of interaction layers that surround the fuel particles. The growth rate depends upon the temperature and radiation environment. The cellular automaton algorithm described in this paper can synthesize realistic random fuel-particle structures and simulate the growth of the intermetallic interaction layers. Examples in the present paper pack approximately 1000 particles into three-dimensional rectangular fuel structures that are approximately 1 mm on each side. The computational approach is designed to yield synthetic microstructures consistent with images from actual fuel plates and is validated by comparison with empirical data on actual fuel plates.

One set of samples are thermally annealed under high vacuum at 450 C or 550 C for one hour. A second set of samples are annealed identically but with concurrent 3.5 MeV Fe++ ion irradiation. The Fe++ ion penetration depth is sufficient to reach the original interfaces. Rutherford backscattering spectrometry analysis with high fidelity spectral simulations is used to obtain interdiffusion profiles, which are used to examine differences in U diffusion and intermetallic phase formation at the buried interfaces. For all three diffusion systems, Fe++ ion irradiations enhance U diffusion. Furthermore, the irradiations accelerate the formation of intermetallic phases. In U/Fe couples, for example, the unirradiated samples show typical interdiffusion governed by Fick’s laws, while the irradiated ones show step-like profiles influenced by Gibbs phase rules.","Elsevier","","Idaho National Lab.

The results from these studies indicated that the principal mechanism of hot corrosion was associated with chromium leaching for all of the superalloys described above. However, HastelloyTM N displayed the best hot corrosion performance. This was not surprising given it was developed originally to withstand the harsh conditions of molten salt environment. However, the results obtained in this study provided confidence in the employed methods of computational thermodynamics and could be further used for future alloy design efforts.

"An analysis of nuclear fuel burnup in the AGR-1 TRISO fuel experiment using gamma spectrometry, mass spectrometry, and computational simulation techniques","Harp, Jason M.; Demkowicz, Paul A.; Winston, Philip L.; Sterbentz, James W.","11 NUCLEAR FUEL CYCLE AND FUEL MATERIALS; BURNUP; GAMMA SPECTROSCOPY; MASS SPECTROSCOPY; AGR-1; burnup; experiment computation comparison; gamma spectrometry; mass spectrometry; TRISO","AGR 1 was the first in a series of experiments designed to test US TRISO fuel under high temperature gas-cooled reactor irradiation conditions. This experiment was irradiated in the Advanced Test Reactor (ATR) at Idaho National Laboratory (INL) and is currently undergoing post irradiation examination (PIE) at INL and Oak Ridge National Laboratory. One component of the AGR 1 PIE is the experimental evaluation of the burnup of the fuel by two separate techniques. Gamma spectrometry was used to non destructively evaluate the burnup of all 72 of the TRISO fuel compacts that comprised the AGR 1 experiment. Two methods for evaluating burnup by gamma spectrometry were developed, one based on the Cs 137 activity and the other based on the ratio of Cs 134 and Cs 137 activities. Burnup values determined from both methods compared well with the values predicted from simulations. The highest measured burnup was 20.1% FIMA for the direct method and 20.0% FIMA for the ratio method (compared to 19.56% FIMA from simulations). An advantage of the ratio method is that the burnup of the cylindrical fuel compacts can determined in small (2.5 mm) axial increments and an axial burnup profile can be produced. Destructive chemical analysis by inductively coupled mass spectrometry (ICP MS) was then performed on selected compacts that were representative of the expected range of fuel burnups in the experiment to compare with the burnup values determined by gamma spectrometry. The compacts analyzed by mass spectrometry had a burnup range of 19.3% FIMA to 10.7% FIMA. The mass spectrometry evaluation of burnup for the four compacts agreed well with the gamma spectrometry burnup evaluations and the expected burnup from simulation. For all four compacts analyzed by mass spectrometry, the maximum range in the three experimentally determined values and the predicted value was 6% or less. Furthermore, the results confirm the accuracy of the nondestructive burnup evaluation from gamma spectrometry for TRISO fuel compacts across a burnup range of approximately 10 to 20% FIMA and also validate the approach used in the physics simulation of the AGR 1 experiment.","Elsevier","","Idaho National Lab.

M.","11 NUCLEAR FUEL CYCLE AND FUEL MATERIALS; 97 MATHEMATICS AND COMPUTING; nuclear fuel performance modeling; validation; verification","Complex multiphysics simulations such as nuclear fuel performance analysis are composed of many submodels used to describe specific phenomena. These phenomena include, as examples, the relationship between stress and strain, heat transfer across a gas gap, and mechanical contact. These submodels work in concert to simulate real-world events, like the behavior of a fuel rod in a reactor. If a simulation tool is able to represent real-world behavior, the tool is said to be validated. While much emphasis is rightly placed on validation, model verification may be undervalued. Verification involves showing that a model performs as intended, that it computes results consistent with its mathematical description. This paper explains the differences between verification and validation and shows how validation should be preceded by verification. Specific verification problems, including several specific to nuclear fuel analysis, are given. Validation results are also presented.","Elsevier","","Idaho National Lab.

"Modeling and simulation of hydrogen behavior in Zircaloy-4 fuel cladding","Hales, Jason D.; Various,","11 NUCLEAR FUEL CYCLE AND FUEL MATERIALS; Zirconium-alloy, Hydrogen, BISON, Fuel Cladding","As a result of corrosion during normal operation in nuclear reactors, hydrogen can enter the zirconium-alloy fuel cladding and precipitate as brittle hydride platelets, which can severely degrade the cladding ductility. Under a heterogeneous temperature distribution, hydrides tend to accumulate in the colder areas, creating local spots of degraded cladding that can favor crack initiation. Therefore, an estimation of the local hydride distribution is necessary to help predict the risk of cladding failure. The hydride distribution is governed by three competing phenomena. Hydrogen in solid solution diffuses under a concentration gradient due to Fick’s law and under a temperature gradient due to the Soret effect. Precipitation of the hydride platelets occurs once the hydrogen solubility limit is reached. A model of these phenomena was implemented in the 3D fuel performance code BISON in order to calculate the hydrogen distribution for arbitrary geometries, such as a nuclear fuel rod, and is now available for BISON users. Simulations have been performed on simple geometries to validate the model and its implementation. The simulations predict that before precipitation occurs, hydrogen tends to accumulate in the colder spots due to the Soret effect. Once the solubility limit is reached, hydrogen precipitates and forms a rim close to the outer edge of the cladding. The simulations also predict that the reactor shut down has little effect on already precipitated hydrides but causes the remaining hydrogen to precipitate homogeneously into hydrides.","","","Idaho National Lab.

A non-dimensional stress intensity factor formula is obtained through 2D axisymmetric analyses considering lenticular bubbles and Mode-I crack growth.

For coincident site lattice boundaries of different configurations, the boundary thermal resistance of unirradiated UO2 can be well described by a parameter-reduced formula by using boundary energies as variables. We extended the study to defect-loaded UO2 by introducing damage cascades in close vicinity to the boundaries. Following cascade annealing and defect migrations towards grain boundaries, the boundary energy increases and so does Kaptiza resistance. The correlations between these two still follow the same formula extracted from the unirradiated UO2. The finding will benefit multi-scale modeling of UO2 thermal properties under extreme radiation conditions by combining effects from boundary configurations and damage levels.","Elsevier","","Idaho National Lab.

Nine interatomic potentials, seven rigid-ion plus two core–shell ones, were utilized to elucidate possible potential dependence. Initiating from a notch, crack propagation along grain boundaries was observed for most potentials. The S3 boundary was found to be more prone to fracture than the S5 one, indicated by a lower energy release rate associated with the former. However, some potential dependence was identified on the existence of transient plastic deformation at crack tips, and the results were discussed regarding the relevant material properties including the excess energies of metastable phases and the critical energy release rate for intergranular fracture. In general, local plasticity at crack tips was observed in fracture simulations with potentials that predict low excess energies for metastable phases and high critical energy release rates for intergranular fracture.","Elsevier","","Idaho National Lab.

Due to the large radiation fields associated with these materials, they are hard to handle and typically have to be contained in large hot cells. Even the equipment used for performing characterization is housed in hot cells or shielded glove boxes. The result is not only a limitation in the techniques that can be employed for characterization, but also a limitation in the size of features that can be resolved The most standard characterization techniques include light optical metallography (WM), scanning electron microscopy (SEM), and electron probe microanalysis (EPMA). These techniques are applied to samples that are typically prepared using grinding and polishing approaches that will always generate some mechanical damage on the sample surface. As a result, when performing SEM analysis, for example, the analysis is limited by the quality of the sample surface that can be prepared. However, a new approach for characterizing irradiated nuclear fuel has recently been developed at the Idaho National Laboratory (INL) in Idaho Falls, Idaho. It allows for a dramatic improvement in the quality of characterization that can be performed when using an instrument like an SEM. This new approach uses a dual-beam scanning microscope, where one of the beams isa focused ion beam (FIB), which can be used to generate specimens of irradiated fuel (-10µm x 10µm) for microstructural characterization, and the other beam is the electron beam of an SEM. One significant benefit of this approach is that the specimen surface being characterized has received much less damage (and smearing) than is caused by the more traditional approaches, which enables the imaging of nanometer­ sized microstructural features in the SEM. The process details are for an irradiated low-enriched uranium (LEU) U-Mo alloy fuel Another type of irradiated fuel that has been characterized using this technique is a mixed oxide fuel.","","","Idaho National Lab.

In order to study the fundamental diffusional interactions between U with Fe and the alloying effect of Cr and Ni, solid-to-solid diffusion couples were assembled between pure U and Fe, Fe–15 wt.%Cr or Fe–15 wt.%Cr–15 wt.%Ni alloy, and annealed at high temperature ranging from 580 to 700 °C. The microstructures and concentration profiles that developed from the diffusion anneal were examined by scanning electron microscopy, and X-ray energy dispersive spectroscopy (XEDS), respectively.

The interdiffusion and reactions in the U vs. Fe and U vs. Fe–Cr–Ni exhibited a similar temperature dependence, while the U vs. Fe–Cr diffusion couples, without the presence of Ni, yielded greater activation energy for the growth of intermetallic phases – lower growth rate at lower temperature but higher growth rate at higher temperature.","","","Idaho National Lab.

Among the methods explored currently to improve zircaloys’ thermal stability in off-normal conditions, using a protective coat of the SiC filaments is considered because silicon carbide is well known for its remarkable chemical inertness at high temperatures. A typical SiC fiber contains ~50,000 individual filaments of 5 – 10 µm in diameter. In this paper, an effort was made to develop and apply mathematical morphology to the process of automatic defect identification in Zircaloy-4 rods braided with the protective layer of the silicon carbide filament. However, the issues of the braiding quality have to be addressed to ensure its full protective potential. We present the original mathematical morphology algorithms that allow solving this problem of quality assurance successfully.

"Modeling and Analysis of UN TRISO Fuel for LWR Application Using the PARFUME Code","Collin, Blaise","11 NUCLEAR FUEL CYCLE AND FUEL MATERIALS; AGR; Light Water Reactor; NGNP; PARFUME; TDO; TRISO; VHTR","The Idaho National Laboraroty (INL) PARFUME (particle fuel model) code was used to assess the overall fuel performance of uranium nitride (UN) tristructural isotropic (TRISO) ceramic fuel under irradiation conditions typical of a Light Water Reactor (LWR). The dimensional changes of the fuel particle layers and kernel were calculated, including the formation of an internal gap. The survivability of the UN TRISO particle was estimated depending on the strain behavior of the constituent materials at high fast fluence and burn up. For nominal cases, internal gas pressure and representative thermal profiles across the kernel and layers were determined along with stress levels in the inner and outer pyrolytic carbon (IPyC/OPyC) and silicon carbide (SiC) layers. These parameters were then used to evaluate fuel particle failure probabilities. Results of the study show that the survivability of UN TRISO fuel under LWR irradiation conditions might only be guaranteed if the kernel and PyC swelling rates are limited at high fast fluence and burn up. These material properties have large uncertainties at the irradiation levels expected to be reached by UN TRISO fuel in LWRs. Therefore, a large experimental effort would be needed to establish material properties, including kernel and PyC swelling rates, under these conditions before definitive conclusions can be drawn on the behavior of UN TRISO fuel in LWRs.","Elsevier","","Idaho National Lab.

"Synergistic Extraction of Dysprosium and Aggregate Formation in Solvent Extraction Systems Combining TBP and HDBP","Anderson, Timothy L.; Braatz, Alex; Ellis, Ross J.; Antonio, Mark R.; Nilsson, Mikael","11 NUCLEAR FUEL CYCLE AND FUEL MATERIALS; Synergism; aggregation; reverse micelles; nuclear fuel separation; lanthanides; Small-Angle X-ray Scattering (SAXS)","During treatment of nuclear fuel in the Plutonium/URanium EXtraction (PUREX) process, the extractant tri-n-butyl phosphate (TBP) is known to degrade to dibutylphosphoric acid (HDBP), which increases the extraction of metal ions, thereby inhibiting their stripping from the organic phase. To better understand this phenomenon, we investigated how mixtures of TBP and HDBP influenced the extraction of metal, nitric acid, and water, and correlated the results to aggregated structures in the organic phase. The mole ratios of TBP-HDBP mixtures had a non-linear effect on the extraction of Dy<sup>3+</sup> and water from 0.2 M HNO<sub>3</sub>, indicating synergism. In 2 M HNO<sub>3</sub>, the TBP:HDBP mole ratio had a more linear relation to Dy<sup>3+</sup> and water extraction, so the synergistic effect was less pronounced than in the low acid system. The extraction of nitric acid showed no synergistic effect and follows closely what would be expected in a system using TBP only. The small-angle X-ray scattering (SAXS) data of the 0.2 M acid system showed maximum contrast at a TBP:HDBP mole ratio of 0.25, so that the synergistic mixture is also the most aggregated at 0.2 M acid. The 2 M acid system also showed that the mixed system is more aggregated than the end members, although this does not result in peak extraction. Previous studies of synergistic extraction of metal cations explain the enhanced extraction by increased dehydration of the metal ion. Although our data do not rule out the formation of mixed complexes according to the classical mechanism of synergism, our evidence of increased water extraction and aggregate formation in systems combining TBP and HDBP are complementary to the metal-centric dehydration aspects of the process. The findings in this study give insights into the complex chemistry of solvent extraction, thus providing a possible link between formation of aggregates in the organic phase and synergistic extraction.","Taylor and Francis","","Argonne National Lab.

The detector is comprised of a series of energy-selective stacks of converter foils immersed in a noble-gas based mixture, coupled to a position-sensitive charge readout. Each foil in the various stacks is made of two layers of different thicknesses, fastened together: a hydrogen-rich (plastic) layer for neutron-to-proton conversion, and a hydrogen-free coating to selectively stop/absorb the recoil protons below a certain energy cut-off. The neutron-induced recoil protons, that escape the converter foils, release ionization electrons in the gas gaps between consecutive foils. The electrons are then drifted towards and localized by a position-sensitive charge amplification and readout stage. Comparison of the images detected by stacks with different energy cut-offs allows energy-selective imaging. Neutron energy spectrometry is realized by analyzing the responses of a sufficient large number of stacks of different energy response and unfolding techniques. In this paper, we present the results of computer simulation studies and discuss the expected performance of the new detector concept. Potential applications in various fields are also briefly discussed, in particularly, the application of energy-selective fast-neutron imaging for nuclear safeguards application, with the aim of determining the plutonium content in Mixed Oxide (MOX) fuels.","","","","","","United States","2014-07-15T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: Review of Scientific Instruments; Journal Volume: 85; Journal Issue: 7; Other Information: (c) 2014 AIP Publishing LLC; Country of input: International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA)","","Medium: X; Size: page(s) 073305-073305.8","","","","Journal ID: ISSN 0034-6748; CODEN: RSINAK; TRN: US14B4271014845","10.1063/1.4890392","","2015-02-27T00:00:00Z","22308672","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/22308672","","Review of Scientific Instruments","7","85"

The MURE package has been coupled to fission product beta decay nuclear databases for studying reactor antineutrino emission. This method is the only one able to predict the antineutrino emission from future reactor cores, which don't use the thermal fission of {sup 235}U, {sup 239}Pu and {sup 241}Pu. It is also the only way to include off-equilibrium effects, due to neutron captures and time evolution of the fission product concentrations during a reactor cycle. We will present here the first predictions of antineutrino energy spectra from innovative reactor designs (Generation IV reactors). We will then discuss a summary of our results of non-proliferation scenarios involving the latter reactor designs, taking into account reactor physics constraints.","","Available from http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.nds.2014.07.029","","","","United States","2014-06-15T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: Nuclear Data Sheets; Journal Volume: 120; Other Information: Copyright (c) 2014 Elsevier Science B.V., Amsterdam, The Netherlands, All rights reserved.; Country of input: International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA)","","Medium: X; Size: page(s) 141-144","","","","Journal ID: ISSN 0090-3752; CODEN: NDTSBA; PII: S0090-3752(14)00481-5; TRN: US15R2817006149","10.1016/J.NDS.2014.07.029","","2016-03-04T00:00:00Z","22436706","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/22436706","","Nuclear Data Sheets","","120"

"Large-eddy simulations of turbulent flow for grid-to-rod fretting in nuclear reactors","Bakosi, J.; Christon, M. A.; Lowrie, R. B.; Pritchett-Sheats, L. A.; Nourgaliev, R. R.","97 MATHEMATICS AND COMPUTING; 11 NUCLEAR FUEL CYCLE AND FUEL MATERIALS; 21 SPECIFIC NUCLEAR REACTORS AND ASSOCIATED PLANTS","The grid-to-rod fretting (GTRF) problem in pressurized water reactors is a flow-induced vibration problem that results in wear and failure of the fuel rods in nuclear assemblies. In order to understand the fluid dynamics of GTRF and to build an archival database of turbulence statistics for various configurations, implicit large-eddy simulations of time-dependent single-phase turbulent flow have been performed in 3 × 3 and 5 × 5 rod bundles with a single grid spacer. To assess the computational mesh and resolution requirements, a method for quantitative assessment of unstructured meshes with no-slip walls is described. The calculations have been carried out using Hydra-TH, a thermal-hydraulics code developed at Los Alamos for the Consortium for Advanced Simulation of Light water reactors, a United States Department of Energy Innovation Hub. Hydra-TH uses a second-order implicit incremental projection method to solve the singlephase incompressible Navier-Stokes equations. The simulations explicitly resolve the large scale motions of the turbulent flow field using first principles and rely on a monotonicity-preserving numerical technique to represent the unresolved scales. Each series of simulations for the 3 × 3 and 5 × 5 rod-bundle geometries is an analysis of the flow field statistics combined with a mesh-refinement study and validation with available experimental data. Our primary focus is the time history and statistics of the forces loading the fuel rods. These hydrodynamic forces are believed to be the key player resulting in rod vibration and GTRF wear, one of the leading causes for leaking nuclear fuel which costs power utilities millions of dollars in preventive measures. As a result, we demonstrate that implicit large-eddy simulation of rod-bundle flows is a viable way to calculate the excitation forces for the GTRF problem.","Elsevier","","Los Alamos National Lab.

"Irradiated Microsphere Gamma Analyzer for Examination of Particle Fuel","Demkowicz, Paul A.; Various,","11 NUCLEAR FUEL CYCLE AND FUEL MATERIALS; Irradiated Microsphere Gamma Analyzer, Partiicle f","Fabrication of the first series of fuel compacts for the current US tristructural isotropic (TRISO) coated particle fuel development and qualification effort was completed at Oak Ridge National Laboratory (ORNL) in 2006. In November of 2009, after almost 3 years and 620 effective full power days of irradiation in the Advanced Test Reactor at Idaho National Laboratory (INL), the first Advanced Gas Reactor irradiation test (AGR-1) was concluded. Compacts were irradiated at a calculated timeaveraged, volume-averaged temperature of 955–1136°C to a burnup ranging from 11.2–19.5% fissions per initial metal atom and a total fast fluence of 2.2–4.3·1025 n/m2 [1]. No indication of fission product release from TRISO coating failure was observed during the irradiation test, based on real-time monitoring of gaseous fission products. Post-irradiation examination (PIE) and hightemperature safety testing of the compacts has been in progress at both ORNL and INL since 2010, and have revealed small releases of a limited subset of fission products (such as silver, cesium, and europium). Past experience has shown that some elements can be released from TRISO particles when a defect forms in the SiC layer, even when one or more pyrocarbon layers remain intact and retain the gaseous fission products. Some volatile elements can also be released by diffusion through an intact SiC layer during safety testing if temperatures are high enough and the duration is long enough. In order to understand and quantify the release of certain radioactive fission products, it is sometimes necessary to individually examine each of the more than 4000 coated particles in a given compact. The Advanced Irradiated Microsphere Gamma Analyzer (Advanced- IMGA) was designed to perform this task in a remote hot cell environment. This paper describes the Advanced- IMGA equipment and examination process and gives results for a typical full compact evaluation.","","","Idaho National Lab.

Interdiffusion and reactions between Zr and Al, Al-2 wt.% Si, Al-5 wt.% Si or AA6061 were investigated using solid-to-solid diffusion couples annealed in the temperature range of 425 degrees to 625 degrees C. In the binary Al and Zr system, the Al3Zr and Al2Zr phases were identified, and the activation energy for the growth of the Al3Zr phase was determined to be 347 kJ/mol. Negligible diffusional interactions were observed for diffusion couples between Zr vs. Al-2 wt.% Si, Al-5 wt.% Si and AA6061 annealed at or below 475 degrees C. In diffusion couples with the binary Al–Si alloys at 560 degrees C, a significant variation in the development of the phase constituents was observed including the thick t1 (Al5SiZr2) with Si content up to 12 at.%, and thin layers of (Si,Al)2Zr, (Al,Si)3Zr, Al3SiZr2 and Al2Zr phases. The use of AA6061 as a terminal alloy resulted in the development of both T1 (Al5SiZr2) and (Al,Si)3Zr phases with a very thin layer of (Al,Si)2Zr. At 560 degrees C, with increasing Si content in the Al–Si alloy, an increase in the overall rate of diffusional interaction was observed; however, the diffusional interaction of Zr in contact with multicomponent AA6061 with 0.4–0.8 wt.% Si was most rapid.","","","Idaho National Lab.

This bias is due primarily to the thermal conductivity mismatch between sample and meter bars (reference), which is common for a sample of unknown thermal conductivity. A correction scheme, based on a finite element simulation of the measurement system, was proposed to reduce the magnitude of the overall measurement uncertainty. This scheme was experimentally validated by applying corrections on four types of sample measurements in which the specimen thermal conductivity is much smaller, slightly smaller, equal and much larger than that of the meter bar. As an alternative to the optimum guarding technique proposed before, the correction scheme can be used to minimize uncertainty contribution from the measurement system with non-optimal guarding conditions. It is especially necessary for large thermal conductivity mismatches between sample and meter bars.","","","Idaho National Lab.

"Trivalent Lanthanide/Actinide Separation Using Aqueous-Modified TALSPEAK Chemistry","Grimes, Travis S.; Tillotson, Richard D.; Martin, Leigh R.","11 NUCLEAR FUEL CYCLE AND FUEL MATERIALS; Amino Acid Buffer; Lanthanide Actinide Separations; TALSPEAK Chemistry","TALSPEAK is a liquid/liquid extraction process designed to separate trivalent lanthanides (Ln3+) from minor actinides (MAs) Am3+ and Cm3+. Traditional TALSPEAK organic phase is comprised of a monoacidic dialkyl bis(2-ethylhexyl)phosphoric acid extractant (HDEHP) in diisopropyl benzene (DIPB). The aqueous phase contains a soluble aminopolycarboxylate diethylenetriamine-N,N,N’,N”,N”-pentaacetic acid (DTPA) in a concentrated (1.0-2.0 M) lactic acid (HL) buffer with the aqueous acidity typically adjusted to pH 3.0. TALSPEAK balances the selective complexation of the actinides by DTPA against the electrostatic attraction of the lanthanides by the HDEHP extractant to achieve the desired trivalent lanthanide/actinide group separation. Although TALSPEAK is considered a successful separations scheme, recent fundamental studies have highlighted complex chemical interactions occurring in the aqueous and organic phases during the extraction process. Previous attempts to model the system have shown thermodynamic models do not accurately predict the observed extraction trends in the p[H+] range 2.5-4.8. In this study, the aqueous phase is modified by replacing the lactic acid buffer with a variety of simple and longer-chain amino acid buffers. The results show successful trivalent lanthanide/actinide group separation with the aqueous-modified TALSPEAK process at pH 2. The amino acid buffer concentrations were reduced to 0.5 M (at pH 2) and separations were performed without any effect on phase transfer kinetics. Successful modeling of the aqueous-modified TALSPEAK process (p[H+] 1.6-3.1) using a simplified thermodynamic model and an internally consistent set of thermodynamic data is presented.","","","Idaho National Lab.

However, new electron-diffraction data from two high-Zr inclusions in an alloy containing U, Pu, Np, Am, Zr, and rare-earth elements show that these inclusions are not a-Zr (which has a hexagonal structure) but instead have a face-centered cubic structure. This data is unique in that it combines single-crystal diffraction patterns and microchemical analyses from individual inclusions. More data on other high-Zr inclusions is clearly required.

At intermediate transit energies where electronic and nuclear energy losses are both significant, synergistic, additive or competitive processes may evolve that affect the dynamic response of materials to irradiation. The response of crystalline and nanostructured CeO2 and SiC to ion irradiation are studied under different nuclear and electronic stopping powers to describe some general material response in this transit energy regime. Although fast radiation-induced grain growth in CeO2 is evident with no phase transformation, different fluence and dose dependence on the growth rate is observed under Si and Au irradiations. While grain shrinkage and amorphization are observed in the nano-engineered 3C SiC with a high-density of stacking faults embedded in nanosize columnar grains, significantly enhanced radiation resistance is attributed to stacking faults that promote efficient point defect annihilation.

"Microstructural Characteristics of HIP-bonded Monolithic Nuclear Fuels with a Diffusion Barrier","Jue, Jan-Fong; Keiser, Jr., Dennis D.; Breckenridge, Cynthia R.; Moore, Glenn A.; Meyer, Mitchell K.","11 NUCLEAR FUEL CYCLE AND FUEL MATERIALS; 46 INSTRUMENTATION RELATED TO NUCLEAR SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY; diffusion barrier; microstructure; monolithic; nuclear fuel; U-Mo","Due to the limitation of maximum uranium load achievable by dispersion fuel type, the Global Threat Reduction Initiative (GTRI) is developing an advanced monolithic fuel to convert US high performance research reactors to low-enriched uranium. Hot-isostatic-press bonding was the single process down-selected to bond monolithic U-Mo fuel meat to aluminum alloy cladding. A diffusion barrier was applied to the U–Mo fuel meat by roll-bonding process to prevent extensive interaction between fuel meat and aluminum-alloy cladding. Microstructural characterization was performed on fresh fuel plates fabricated at Idaho National Laboratory. Interfaces between fuel meat, cladding, and diffusion barrier, as well as U–10Mo fuel meat and Al–6061 cladding were characterized by scanning electron microscopy. Preliminary results indicate that the interfaces contain many different phases while decomposition, second phases, and chemical banding were also observed in the fuel meat. The important attributes of the HIP-bonded monolithic fuel are • A typical Zr diffusion barrier of thickness 25 µm • Transverse cross section that exhibits relatively equiaxed grains with an average grain diameter of 10 µm • Chemical banding, in some areas more than 100 µm in length, that is very pronounced in longitudinal (i.e., rolling) direction with Mo concentration varying from 7–13 wt% • Decomposed areas containing plate-shaped low-Mo phase • A typical Zr/cladding interaction layer of thickness 1-2 µm • A visible UZr2 bearing layer of thickness 1-2 µm • Mo-rich precipitates (mainly Mo2Zr, forming a layer in some areas) followed by a Mo-depleted sub-layer between the visible UZr2-bearing layer and the U–Mo matrix • No excessive interaction between cladding and the uncoated fuel edge • Cladding-to-cladding bonding that exhibits no cracks or porosity with second phases high in Mg, Si, and O decorating the bond line. • Some of these attributes might be critical to the irradiation performance of monolithic U-10Mo nuclear fuel. There are several issues or concerns that warrant more detailed study, such as precipitation along cladding-to-cladding bond line, chemical banding, uncovered fuel-zone edge, and interaction layer between U–Mo fuel meat and zirconium. Future post-irradiation examination results will focus, among other things, on identifying in-reactor failure mechanisms and, eventually, directing further fresh fuel characterization efforts.","","","Idaho National Lab.

Irradiated AGR-1 fuel compacts have been cross-sectioned and analyzed with optical microscopy to characterize kernel, buffer, and coating behavior. Six compacts have been examined, spanning a range of irradiation conditions (burnup, fast fluence, and irradiation temperature) and including all four TRISO coating variations irradiated in the AGR-1 experiment. The cylindrical specimens were sectioned both transversely and longitudinally, then polished to expose from 36 to 79 individual particles near midplane on each mount. The analysis focused primarily on kernel swelling and porosity, buffer densification and fracturing, buffer–IPyC debonding, and fractures in the IPyC and SiC layers. Characteristic morphologies have been identified, 981 particles have been classified, and spatial distributions of particle types have been mapped. No significant spatial patterns were discovered in these cross sections. However, some trends were found between morphological types and certain behavioral aspects. Buffer fractures were found in 23% of the particles, and these fractures often resulted in unconstrained kernel protrusion into the open cavities. Fractured buffers and buffers that stayed bonded to IPyC layers appear related to larger pore size in kernels. Buffer–IPyC interface integrity evidently factored into initiation of rare IPyC fractures. Fractures through part of the SiC layer were found in only four classified particles, all in conjunction with IPyC–SiC debonding. Compiled results suggest that the deliberate coating fabrication variations influenced the frequencies of IPyC fractures and IPyC–SiC debonds.","","","Idaho National Lab.

During this multi-year experiment, release-to-birth rate ratios were computed at the end of each operating interval to provide information about fuel performance. Fission products released during irradiation were tracked daily by the Fission Product Monitoring System using 8-h measurements. Birth rate calculated by MCNP with ORIGEN for as-run conditions were computed at the end of each irradiation interval. Each time step in MCNP provided neutron flux, reaction rates and AGR-1 compact composition, which were used to determine birth rate using ORIGEN. The initial birth-rate data, consisting of four values for each irradiation interval at the beginning, end, and two intermediate times, were interpolated to obtain values for each 8-h activity. The problem with this method is that any daily changes in heat rates or perturbations, such as shim control movement or core/lobe power fluctuations, would not be reflected in the interpolated data and a true picture of the system would not be presented. At the conclusion of the AGR-1 experiment, great efforts were put forth to compute daily birthrates, which were reprocessed with the 8-h release activity.

In this paper a brief summary of results from characterization of microstructures in the coating layers of selected irradiated fuel particles with burnup of 11.3% and 19.3% FIMA will be given. The main objectives of the characterization were to study irradiation effects, fuel kernel porosity, layer debonding, layer degradation or corrosion, fission-product precipitation, grain sizes, and transport of fission products from the kernels across the TRISO layers. Characterization techniques such as scanning electron microscopy, transmission electron microscopy, energy dispersive spectroscopy, and wavelength dispersive spectroscopy were used. A new approach to microscopic quantification of fission-product precipitates is also briefly demonstrated. Microstructural characterization focused on fission-product precipitates in the SiC-IPyC interface, the SiC layer and the fuel-buffer interlayer. The results provide significant new insights into mechanisms of fission-product transport. Although Pd-rich precipitates were identified at the SiC-IPyC interlayer, no significant SiC-layer thinning was observed for the particles investigated. Characterization of these precipitates highlighted the difficulty of measuring low concentrations of Ag in precipitates with significantly higher concentrations of Pd and U. Different approaches to resolving this problem are discussed. An initial hypothesis is provided to explain fission-product precipitate compositions and locations. No SiC phase transformations were observed and no debonding of the SiC-IPyC interlayer as a result of irradiation was observed for the samples investigated. Lessons learned from the post-irradiation examination are described and future actions are recommended.","","","Idaho National Lab.

In this paper the possible mechanisms postulated in previous experimental studies, both in-reactor and out-of reactor research environment studies are critically reviewed and of particular interest are relevance to very high temperature gas reactor operating and accident conditions. Among the factors thought to influence Ag transport are grain boundary stoichiometry, SiC grain size and shape, the presence of free silicon, nano-cracks, thermal decomposition, palladium attack, transmutation products, layer thinning and coated particle shape. Additionally new insight to nature and location of fission products has been gained via recent post irradiation electron microscopy examination of TRISO coated particles from the DOE’s fuel development program. The combined effect of critical review and new analyses indicates a direction for investigating possible the Ag transport mechanism including the confidence level with which these mechanisms may be experimentally verified.","","","Idaho National Lab.

Determining the effects of alpha irradiation on a system may be of complementary interest to the effects of gamma irradiation, as alpha radiation has higher linear energy transfer (LET) and will likely result in different chemical damage effects. This becomes important in advanced nuclear fuel cycle processes where the radioactive materials to be handled in solutions contain significant amounts of alpha emitters. In this work, we describe a method for studying high LET radiation in a liquid system using a TRIGA® reactor and the <sup>10</sup>B(n,α)<sup>7</sup>Li reaction. By fitting a model based on neutron diffusion and absorption to experimentally obtained Fricke dosimetry data, the high LET dose to a sample was predictable over the full range of reactor power available and varying <sup>10</sup>B concentration. This method may be applied to study the effects of high LET radiation on any liquid system as long as a suitable molecule containing boron is used and appropriate neutron diffusion coefficients are known. A wide range of high LET dose rates from <10 Gy/h to >1,000 kGy/h may be obtained with this method.","Springer","","Univ. of California, Irvine, CA (United States)","USDOE Office of Nuclear Energy (NE).

Diffusional interactions between the U-Mo fuel alloy and Al-alloy cladding within the monolithic fuel plate construct necessitate incorporation of a barrier layer. Fundamentally, a diffusion barrier candidate must have good thermal conductivity, high melting point, minimal metallurgical interaction, and good irradiation performance. Refractory metals, Zr, Mo, and Nb are considered based on their physical properties, and the diffusion behavior must be carefully examined first with U-Mo fuel alloy. Solid-to-solid U-10wt.%Mo vs. Mo, Zr, or Nb diffusion couples were assembled and annealed at 600, 700, 800, 900 and 1000 degrees C for various times. The interdiffusion microstructures and chemical composition were examined via scanning electron microscopy and electron probe microanalysis, respectively. For all three systems, the growth rate of interdiffusion zone were calculated at 1000, 900 and 800 degrees C under the assumption of parabolic growth, and calculated for lower temperature of 700, 600 and 500 degrees C according to Arrhenius relationship. The growth rate was determined to be about 10 3 times slower for Zr, 10 5 times slower for Mo and 10 6 times slower for Nb, than the growth rates reported for the interaction between the U-Mo fuel alloy and pure Al or Al-Si cladding alloys. Zr, however was selected as the barrier metal due to a concern for thermo- mechanical behavior of UMo/Nb interface observed from diffusion couples, and for ductile-to-brittle transition of Mo near room temperature.","","","Idaho National Lab.

Specifially, samples from irradiated U–7Mo dispersion fuel elements with pure Al, Al–2Si and AA4043 (~4.5 wt.%Si) matrices were SEM characterized using polished samples and samples that were prepared with a focused ion beam (FIB). Features not observable for the polished samples could be captured in SEM images taken of the FIB samples. For the Al matrix sample, a relatively large FMI layer develops, with enrichment of Xe at the FMI layer/Al matrix interface and evidence of debonding. Overall, a significant penetration of Si from the FMI layer into the U–7Mo fuel was observed for samples with Si in the Al matrix, which resulted in a change of the size (larger) and shape (round) of the fission-gas bubbles. Additionally, solid-fission-product phases were observed to nucleate and grow within these bubbles. These changes in the localized regions of the microstructure of the U–7Mo may contribute to changes observed in the macroscopic swelling of fuel plates with Al–Si matrices.","","","Idaho National Lab.

H.","11 NUCLEAR FUEL CYCLE AND FUEL MATERIALS; diffusion; diffusion couples; interdiffusion; interdiffusion coefficients; molybdenum; nuclear fuel; zirconium","Zirconium has recently garnered attention for use as a diffusion barrier between U–Mo metallic nuclear fuels and Al alloy cladding. In order to gain a fundamental understanding of the diffusional interactions, the interdiffusion behavior in the binary Mo–Zr system was investigated via solid-to-solid diffusion couples annealed in the temperature range of 750 to 1050 degrees C. A combination of scanning electron microscopy, X-ray energy dispersive spectroscopy, and electron probe microanalysis were used to examine the microstructure and concentration profiles across the interdiffusion zone. A large __-Zr (cI2) solid solution layer and a thin (approximately 1–2 um) layer of Mo2Zr (cF24) developed in all couples. Parabolic growth constants and concentration dependent interdiffusion coefficients were calculated for the Mo2Zr and Zr solid solution phases, respectively. The pre-exponential factor and activation energy for growth of the Mo2Zr phase were determined to be approximately 6.5 × 10- 15 m2/s and 90 kJ/mol, respectively. The interdiffusion coefficient in ___-Zr solid solution decreased with an increase in Mo concentration. Both the pre-exponential factors (2 × 10- 8 m2/s at 2 at.% Mo to near 5 × 10- 8 m2/s at 9 at.% Mo) and activation energies (140 kJ/mol at 2 at.% Mo to approximately 155 kJ/mol at 9 at.% Mo) of interdiffusion coefficients were determined to increase with an increase in Mo concentration.","","","Idaho National Lab.

"Identification of Silver and Palladium in Irradiated TRISO Coated Particles of the AGR-1 Experiment","van Rooyen, Y. J.; Lillo, T. M.; Wu, Y. Q.","11 NUCLEAR FUEL CYCLE AND FUEL MATERIALS; SiC; silver transport; TRISO coated particle; PALLADIUM","Evidence of the release of certain metallic fission product through intact tristructural isotropic (TRISO) particles has been seen for decades around the world, as well as in the recent AGR-1 experiment at Idaho National Laboratory (INL). However, understanding the basic mechanism of transport is still lacking. This understanding is important because the TRISO coating is part of the high temperature gas reactor functional containment and critical for the safety strategy for licensing purposes. Our approach to identify fission products in irradiated AGR-1 TRISO fuel using scanning transmission electron microscopy (STEM), Electron Energy Loss Spectroscopy (EELS) and Energy Filtered TEM (EFTEM), has led to first-of-a-kind data at the nano-scale indicating the presence of silver at triple points and grain boundaries of the SiC layer in the TRISO particle. Cadmium was also found in the triple junctions. In this initial study, the silver was only identified in SiC grain boundaries and triple points on the edge of the SiC-IPyC interface up to a depth of approximately 0.5 um. Palladium was identified as the main constituent of micron-sized precipitates present at the SiC grain boundaries. Additionally spherical nano-sized palladium rich precipitates were found inside the SiC grains. These nano-sized Pd precipitates were distributed up to a depth of 5 um away from the SiC-IPyC interlayer. No silver was found in the center of the micron-sized fission product precipitates using these techniques, although silver was found on the outer edge of one of the Pd-U-Si containing precipitates which was facing the IPyC layer. Only Pd-U containing precipitates were identified in the IPyC layer and no silver was identified in the IPyC layer. The identification of silver alongside the grain boundaries and the findings of Pd alongside grain boundaries as well as inside the grains, provide significant knowledge for understanding silver and palladium transport in TIRSO fuel, which has been the topic of international research for the past forty years. Additionally the usefulness of the advanced electron microscopic techniques for TRISO coated particle research is demonstrated in this paper.","Elsevier","","Idaho National Lab.

Upon increasing the fluence above this threshold, severe surface flaking and disintegration of samples was observed. Based on scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and X-ray diffraction (XRD) observations the causes of surface failure were associated to high H atomic percent at the peak damage region due to low solubility of H in UO<sub>2</sub>. The resulting lattice stress is believed to exceed the fracture stress of the crystal at the observed fluencies.

The composition of nuclear fallout is complex varying isotopic compositions . As the gaseous cloud traverses from hotter to cooler regions of the atmosphere, the processes of condensation and nucleation entrain environmental materials, vaporized nuclear materials and fission products. The elemental and isotopic composition of the fission products is altered due to chemical fractionation (i.e. the fission product composition that would be expected from fission of the original nuclear material is altered by differences in condensation rates of the elements); the fallout may be enriched or depleted in volatile or refractory fission products. This work describes preliminary results to synthesize, irradiate and fractionate the fission product content of irradiated particulate glass using a thermal distillation two hours after irradiation. The glass was synthesized using a solution-based polymerization of tetraethyl orthosilicate. Uranium was incorporated into the glass particulate at trace concentrations during polymerization. The particulate was subjected to a short thermal neutron irradiation then heated to 1273 K approximately 2 hours after the end of irradiation. Fission products of 133, 134, 135I, 132, 134Te, 135Xe, 138Cs and 91, 92Sr were observed to be distilled from the particulate.

"Ultra-High Temperature Steam Corrosion of Complex Silicates for Nuclear Applications: A Computational Study","Rashkeev, Sergey N.; Glazoff, Michael V.; Tokuhiro, Akira","11 NUCLEAR FUEL CYCLE AND FUEL MATERIALS; steam corrosion","Stability of materials under extreme conditions is an important issue for safety of nuclear reactors. Presently, silicon carbide (SiC) is being studied as a cladding material candidate for fuel rods in boiling-water and pressurized water-cooled reactors (BWRs and PWRs) that would substitute or modify traditional zircaloy materials. The rate of corrosion of the SiC ceramics in hot vapor environment (up to 2200 degrees C) simulating emergency conditions of light water reactor (LWR) depends on many environmental factors such as pressure, temperature, viscosity, and surface quality. Using the paralinear oxidation theory developed for ceramics in the combustion reactor environment, we estimated the corrosion rate of SiC ceramics under the conditions representing a significant power excursion in a LWR. It was established that a significant time – at least 100 h – is required for a typical SiC braiding to significantly degrade even in the most aggressive vapor environment (with temperatures up to 2200 °C) which is possible in a LWR at emergency condition. This provides evidence in favor of using the SiC coatings/braidings for additional protection of nuclear reactor rods against off-normal material degradation during power excursions or LOCA incidents. Additionally, we discuss possibilities of using other silica based ceramics in order to find materials with even higher corrosion resistance than SiC. In particular, we found that zircon (ZrSiO4) is also a very promising material for nuclear applications. Thermodynamic and first-principles atomic-scale calculations provide evidence of zircon thermodynamic stability in aggressive environments at least up to 1535 degrees C.","Elsevier","","Idaho National Lab.

"Oxidation and Hydrogen Uptake in Zirconium, Zircaloy-2 and Zircaloy-4: Computational Thermodynamics and Ab Initio Calculations","Glazoff, Michael V.; Rashkeev, Sergey N.; Tokuhiro, Akira; Sabharwall, Piyush","11 NUCLEAR FUEL CYCLE AND FUEL MATERIALS; oxidation and hydrogen uptake","Zirconium-based alloys Zircaloy-2 and Zircaloy-4 are widely used in nuclear industry as cladding materials for BWRs and PWRs, respectively. Over more than 60 years these materials displayed a very good combination of properties such as low neutron absorption, creep behavior, stress-corrosion cracking resistance, reduced hydrogen uptake, corrosion, and/or oxidation, especially in the case of Zircaloy-4. However, over the last couple of years energetic efforts were undertaken to improve their oxidation resistance during off-normal temperature excursions, as well as to further improve upon the already achieved levels of mechanical behavior and reduced hydrogen uptake. In order to facilitate the development of such novel materials, it is very important to achieve not only engineering control, but also scientific understanding of the underlying material degradation mechanisms, both in working conditions and in storage of spent nuclear fuel. This paper strives to contribute to these efforts by constructing the thermodynamic models of both alloys, constructing of the respective phase diagrams, and oxidation mechanisms. A special emphasis was placed upon the role of zirconium suboxides in hydrogen uptake reduction and the atomic mechanisms of oxidation. To that end, computational thermodynamics calculations were conducted concurrently with first-principles atomistic modeling.","Elsevier","","Idaho National Lab.

Advancements in experimental techniques and equipment are allowing for new insights into previously irradiated samples. In this work dual column focused ion beam (FIB)/scanning electron microscope (SEM) was utilized to prepared transmission electron microscope samples from mixed oxide fuel with a burn-up of 6.7% FIMA. Utilizing the FIB/SEM for preparation resulted in samples with a dose rate of <0.5 mRem/h compared to approximately 1.1 R/h for a traditionally prepared TEM sample. The TEM analysis showed that the sample taken from the cooler rim region of the fuel pellet had approximately 2.5x higher dislocation density than that of the sample taken from the mid-radius due to the lower irradiation temperature of the rim. The dual column FIB/SEM was additionally used to prepared and serially slice approximately 25 um cubes. High quality electron back scatter diffraction (EBSD) were collected from the face at each step, showing, for the first time, the ability to obtain EBSD data from high activity irradiated fuel.","Elsevier","","Idaho National Lab.

"An optimal guarding scheme for thermal conductivity measurement using a guarded cut-bar technique, part 1 experimental study","Xing, Changhu; Jensen, Colby; Folsom, Charles; Ban, Heng; Marshall, Douglas W.","11 NUCLEAR FUEL CYCLE AND FUEL MATERIALS; NGNP; TDO; THERMAL CONDUCTIVITY","In the guarded cut-bar technique, a guard surrounding the measured sample and reference (meter) bars is temperature controlled to carefully regulate heat losses from the sample and reference bars. Guarding is typically carried out by matching the temperature profiles between the guard and the test stack of sample and meter bars. Problems arise in matching the profiles, especially when the thermal conductivitiesof the meter bars and of the sample differ, as is usually the case. In a previous numerical study, the applied guarding condition (guard temperature profile) was found to be an important factor in measurement accuracy. Different from the linear-matched or isothermal schemes recommended in literature, the optimal guarding condition is dependent on the system geometry and thermal conductivity ratio of sample to meter bar. To validate the numerical results, an experimental study was performed to investigate the resulting error under different guarding conditions using stainless steel 304 as both the sample and meter bars. The optimal guarding condition was further verified on a certified reference material, pyroceram 9606, and 99.95% pure iron whose thermal conductivities are much smaller and much larger, respectively, than that of the stainless steel meter bars. Additionally, measurements are performed using three different inert gases to show the effect of the insulation effective thermal conductivity on measurement error, revealing low conductivity, argon gas, gives the lowest error sensitivity when deviating from the optimal condition. The result of this study provides a general guideline for the specific measurement method and for methods requiring optimal guarding or insulation.","Elsevier","","Idaho National Lab.

"Characterization of Used Nuclear Fuel with Multivariate Analysis for Process Monitoring","Dayman, Kenneth J.; Coble, Jamie B.; Orton, Christopher R.; Schwantes, Jon M.","11 NUCLEAR FUEL CYCLE AND FUEL MATERIALS; Multi-Isotope Process Monitor; Safeguards; Fuel Reprocessing; Process Monitoring","The Multi-Isotope Process (MIP) Monitor combines gamma spectroscopy and multivariate analysis to detect anomalies in various process streams in a nuclear fuel reprocessing system. Measured spectra are compared to models of nominal behavior at each measurement location to detect unexpected changes in system behavior. In order to improve the accuracy and specificity of process monitoring, fuel characterization may be used to more accurately train subsequent models in a full analysis scheme. This paper presents initial development of a reactor-type classifier that is used to select a reactor-specific partial least squares model to predict fuel burnup. Nuclide activities for prototypic used fuel samples were generated in ORIGEN-ARP and used to investigate techniques to characterize used nuclear fuel in terms of reactor type (pressurized or boiling water reactor) and burnup. A variety of reactor type classification algorithms, including k-nearest neighbors, linear and quadratic discriminant analyses, and support vector machines, were evaluated to differentiate used fuel from pressurized and boiling water reactors. Then, reactor type-specific partial least squares models were developed to predict the burnup of the fuel. Using these reactor type-specific models instead of a model trained for all light water reactors improved the accuracy of burnup predictions. The developed classification and prediction models were combined and applied to a large dataset that included eight fuel assembly designs, two of which were not used in training the models, and spanned the range of the initial 235U enrichment, cooling time, and burnup values expected of future commercial used fuel for reprocessing. Error rates were consistent across the range of considered enrichment, cooling time, and burnup values. Average absolute relative errors in burnup predictions for validation data both within and outside the training space were 0.0574% and 0.0597%, respectively. The errors seen in this work are artificially low, because the models were trained, optimized, and tested on simulated, noise-free data. However, these results indicate that the developed models may generalize well to new data and that the proposed approach constitutes a viable first step in developing a fuel characterization algorithm based on gamma spectra.","Elsevier","","Pacific Northwest National Lab.

In this work, we use a phase field (PF) model to investigate the impact of temperature gradients on normal grain growth. GB motion in 2D UO2 polycrystals is predicted under increasing temperature gradients. We find that the temperature gradient does not significantly impact the average grain growth behavior, because the curvature driving force is dominant. However, it does cause significant local migration of the individual grains. In addition, the change in the GB mobility due to the temperature gradient results in larger grains in the hot portion of the polycrystal.","","","Idaho National Lab.

"Scoping assessments of ATF impact on late–stage accident progression including molten core-concrete interaction","Farmer, Mitchell T.; Leibowitz, Leonard; Terrani, Kurt A.; Robb, Kevin R.","11 NUCLEAR FUEL CYCLE AND FUEL MATERIALS","Simple scoping models that can be used to evaluate ATF performance under severe accident conditions have been developed. The methodology provides a fundamental technical basis (a.k.a. metric) based on the thermodynamic boundary for evaluating performance relative to that of traditional Zr-based claddings. The initial focus in this study was on UO<sub>2</sub> fuel with the advanced claddings 310 SS, D9, FeCrAl, and SiC. The evaluation considered only energy release with concurrent combustible gas production from fuel–cladding–coolant interactions and, separately, molten core–concrete interactions at high temperatures. Other important phenomenological effects that can influence the rate and extent of cladding decomposition (e.g., eutectic interactions, degradation of other core constituents) were not addressed. For the cladding types addressed, potential combustible gas production under both in-vessel and ex-vessel conditions was similar to that for Zr. However, exothermic energy release from cladding oxidation was substantially less for iron-based alloys (by at least a factor of 4), and modestly less (by ~20%) for SiC. Data on SiC-clad UO<sub>2</sub> fuel performance under severe accident conditions are sparse in the literature; thus, assumptions on the nature of the cladding decomposition process were made in order to perform this initial screening evaluation. Furthermore, experimental data for this system under severe accident conditions is needed for a proper evaluation and comparison to iron-based claddings.","Elsevier","","Oak Ridge National Lab.

In this paper, we develop estimates of the source term for a generic MHTGR to illustrate the performance of the radionuclide barriers that comprise the MHTGR functional containment.

Through the operation of the Experimental Breeder Reactor II metallic nuclear fuels have been shown to be robust and easily manufactured. However, concerns have been raised concerning loss of americium during the casting process because of its high vapor pressure. In order to address these concerns a gaseous diffusion model was developed and a series of experiments using both manganese and samarium as surrogates for americium were conducted. The modeling results showed that volatility losses can be controlled to essentially no losses with a modest overpressure. Experimental results also showed volatile species retention down to no detectable losses through overpressure, although the loss values varied from the model results the same trend was seen. Bases on these results it is very probably that americium losses through volatility can be controlled to no detectable losses through application of a modest overpressure during casting.","","","Idaho National Lab.

Optical metallography of fuel cross-sections measured the fuel-to-cladding gap, clad thickness, and central void evolution in the samples. The fuel-to-cladding gap closed significantly in samples with burn-ups below 7–9% FIMA. Samples with burn-ups in excess of 7–9% FIMA had a reopening of the fuel-to-cladding gap and evidence of joint oxide-gain (JOG) formation. Signs of axial fuel migration to the top of the fuel column were observed in the fuel pin with a peak burn-up of 23.7% FIMA. Additionally, high burn-up structure (HBS) was observed in the two highest burn-up samples (23.7% and 21.3% FIMA). The HBS layers were found to be 3–5 times thicker than the layers found in typical LWR fuel. The results of the study indicate that formation of JOG and or HBS prevents any significant fuel-cladding mechanical interaction from occurring, thereby extending the potential life of the fuel elements.","","","Idaho National Lab.

"Review of the NURE Assessment of the U.S. Gulf Coast Uranium Province","Hall, Susan M., E-mail: SusanHall@usgs.gov","11 NUCLEAR FUEL CYCLE AND FUEL MATERIALS; 58 GEOSCIENCES; COST; EVALUATION; EXPLORATION; MINES; MINING; PRICES; REVIEWS; URANIUM; URANIUM OXIDES U3O8; URANIUM RESERVES; US GULF COAST","Historic exploration and development were used to evaluate the reliability of domestic uranium reserves and potential resources estimated by the U.S. Department of Energy national uranium resource evaluation (NURE) program in the U.S. Gulf Coast Uranium Province. NURE estimated 87 million pounds of reserves in the $30/lb U{sub 3}O{sub 8} cost category in the Coast Plain uranium resource region, most in the Gulf Coast Uranium Province. Since NURE, 40 million pounds of reserves have been mined, and 38 million pounds are estimated to remain in place as of 2012, accounting for all but 9 million pounds of U{sub 3}O{sub 8} in the reserve or production categories in the NURE estimate. Considering the complexities and uncertainties of the analysis, this study indicates that the NURE reserve estimates for the province were accurate. An unconditional potential resource of 1.4 billion pounds of U{sub 3}O{sub 8}, 600 million pounds of U{sub 3}O{sub 8} in the forward cost category of $30/lb U{sub 3}O{sub 8} (1980 prices), was estimated in 106 favorable areas by the NURE program in the province. Removing potential resources from the non-productive Houston embayment, and those reserves estimated below historic and current mining depths reduces the unconditional potential resource 33% to about 930 million pounds of U{sub 3}O{sub 8}, and that in the $30/lb cost category 34% to 399 million pounds of U{sub 3}O{sub 8}. Based on production records and reserve estimates tabulated for the region, most of the production since 1980 is likely from the reserves identified by NURE. The potential resource predicted by NURE has not been developed, likely due to a variety of factors related to the low uranium prices that have prevailed since 1980.","","","","","","United States","2013-09-15T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: Natural Resources Research (New York, N.Y.); Journal Volume: 22; Journal Issue: 3; Other Information: Copyright (c) 2013 International Association for Mathematical Geology; Article Copyright (c) 2013 Springer Science+Business Media New York (outside the USA); http://www.springer-ny.com; Country of input: International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA)","","Medium: X; Size: page(s) 255-272","","","","Journal ID: ISSN 1520-7439; TRN: US14K0344031459","10.1007/S11053-013-9198-4","","2014-03-27T00:00:00Z","22210533","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/22210533","","Natural Resources Research (New York, N.Y.)","3","22"

La2O3 was added to this alloy instead of the traditionally used Y2O3. The effects of varying the ball milling parameters, such as milling time, steel ball size and ball to powder ratio, on the mechanical properties and micro structural characteristics of the as-milled powder were investigated. Nanocrystallites of a body-centered cubic ferritic solid solution matrix with a mean size of approximately 20 nm were observed by transmission electron microscopy. Nanoscale characterization of the as-milled powder by local electrode atom probe tomography revealed the formation of Cr–Ti–La–O-enriched nanoclusters during mechanical alloying. The Cr:Ti:La:O ratio is considered “non-stoichiometric”. The average size (radius) of the nanoclusters was about 1 nm, with number density of 3.7 1024 m3. The mechanism for formation of nanoclusters in the as-milled powder is discussed. La2O3 appears to be a promising alternative rare earth oxide for future nanostructured ferritic steels.","","","Idaho National Lab.

"Consideration of Grain Size Distribution in the Diffusion of Fission Gas to Grain Boundaries","Millett, Paul C.; Zhang, Yongfeng; Tonks, Michael R.; Biner, S. B.","11 NUCLEAR FUEL CYCLE AND FUEL MATERIALS; Fission Gas Release","We analyze the accumulation of fission gas on grain boundaries in a polycrystalline microstructure with a distribution of grain sizes. The diffusion equation is solved throughout the microstructure to evolve the gas concentration in space and time. Grain boundaries are treated as infinite sinks for the gas concentration, and we monitor the cumulative gas inventory on each grain boundary throughout time. We consider two important cases: first, a uniform initial distribution of gas concentration without gas production (correlating with post-irradiation annealing), and second, a constant gas production rate with no initial gas concentration (correlating with in-reactor conditions). The results show that a single-grain-size model, such as the Booth model, over predicts the gas accumulation on grain boundaries compared with a polycrystal with a grain size distribution. Also, a considerable degree of scatter, or variability, exists in the grain boundary gas accumulation when comparing all of the grain boundaries in the microstructure.","","","Idaho National Lab.

Choppin’s research group completed numerous investigations featuring the application of distribution techniques to the determination of metal complexation equilibrium quotients. Most of these studies focused on the chemistry of lanthanide and actinide complexes. In keeping with that tradition, this report discusses the complex formation equilibrium constants for complexes of trivalent europium (Eu3+) with benzene-1,2-diphosphonic acid (H4BzDP) determined using solvent extraction distribution experiments in 0.2 M (Na,H)ClO4 media in the temperature range of 5 – 45 degrees C. Protonation constants for HnBzDP4-n and stoichiometry and stability of BzDP4- complexes with Zn2+, Ni2+, and Cu2+ have also been determined using potentiometric titration (at I = 0.1 M) and 31P NMR spectroscopy. Heats of protonation of HnBzDPn-4 species have been determined by titration calorimetry. From the temperature dependence of the complex Eu3+-HnBzDPn-4 equilibrium constant, a composite enthalpy (?H = -15.1 (+/-1.0) kJ mol-1) of complexation has been computed. Comparing these thermodynamic parameters with literature reports on other diphosphonic acids and structurally similar carboxylic acids indicates that exothermic heats of complexation are unique to the Eu-BzDP system. Comparisons with thermodynamic data from the literature indicate that the fixed geometry imposed by the benzene ring enhances complex stability.","","","Idaho National Lab.

Spark plasma sintering (SPS) was used to consolidate the ODS alloys from powders that were milled with 0.5 wt.% Y2O3 powder only or with Y2O3 powder and 1 wt.% Ti. TEM characterization revealed that both alloys have a bimodal structure of nanometer-size (~ 100 – 500 nm) and micron-size grains with nanostructured oxide precipitates formed along and close to grain boundaries with diameters ranging from five to tens of nanometers.

"Radioactive Iodine and Krypton Control for Nuclear Fuel Reprocessing Facilities","Soelberg, Nicolas R.; Garn, Troy; Greenhalgh, Mitchell; Law, Jack; Jubin, Robert T.; Strachan, Denis M.; Thallapally, Praveen K.","11 NUCLEAR FUEL CYCLE AND FUEL MATERIALS","Nuclear fission results in the production of fission products and activation products, some of which tend to be volatile during used fuel reprocessing. These can evolve in volatile species in the reprocessing facility off-gas streams, depending on the separations and reprocessing technologies that are used. Radionuclides that have been identified as “volatile radionuclides” are noble gases (most notably isotopes of Kr and Xe); 3H; 14C; and 129I. Radionuclides that tend to form volatile species that evolve into reprocessing facility off-gas systems are more challenging to efficiently control compared to radionuclides that tend to stay in solid or liquid phases. Future used fuel reprocessing facilities in the United States can require efficient capture of some volatile radionuclides in their off-gas streams to meet regulatory emission requirements. In aqueous reprocessing, these radionuclides are most commonly expected to evolve into off-gas streams in tritiated water [3H2O (T2O) and 3HHO (THO)], radioactive CO2, noble gases, and gaseous HI, I2, or volatile organic iodides. The fate and speciation of these radionuclides from a non-aqueous fuel reprocessing facility is less well known at this time, but active investigations are in progress. An Off-Gas Sigma Team was formed in late FY 2009 to integrate and coordinate the Fuel Cycle Research and Development (FCR&D) activities directed towards the capture and sequestration of the these volatile radionuclides (Jubin 2012a). The Sigma Team concept was envisioned to bring together multidisciplinary teams from across the DOE complex that would work collaboratively to solve the technical challenges and to develop the scientific basis for the capture and immobilization technologies such that the sum of the efforts was greater than the individual parts. The Laboratories currently participating in this effort are Argonne National Laboratory (ANL), Idaho National Laboratory (INL), Oak Ridge National Laboratory (ORNL), Pacific Northwest National Laboratory (PNNL), and Sandia National Laboratories (SNL). This article focuses on control of volatile radionuclides that evolve during aqueous reprocessing of UNF. In particular, most of the work by the Off-gas Sigma Team has focused on the capture and sequestration of 129I and 85Kr, mainly because, as discussed below, control of 129I can require high efficiencies to meet regulatory requirements, and control of 85Kr using cryogenic processing, which has been the technology demonstrated and used commercially to date, can add considerable cost to a reprocessing facility.","","","Pacific Northwest National Lab.

"Technetium Chemistry in the Fuel Cycle: Combining Basic and Applied Studies","Poineau, Frederic; Mausolf, Edward; Jarvinen, Gordon D.; Sattelberger, Alfred P.; Czerwinski, Kenneth R.","11 NUCLEAR FUEL CYCLE AND FUEL MATERIALS","Technetium is intimately linked with nuclear reactions. The ultraminute natural levels in the environment are due to the spontaneous fission of uranium isotopes. The discovery of technetium was born from accelerator reactions, and its use and presence in the modern world are directly due to nuclear reactors. While occupying a central location in the periodic table, the chemistry of technetium is poorly explored, especially when compared to its neighboring elements, i.e., molybdenum, ruthenium, and rhenium. This state of affairs, which is tied to the small number of laboratories equipped to work with the long-lived (99)Tc isotope, provides a remarkable opportunity to combine basic studies with applications for the nuclear fuel cycle. An example is given through examination of the technetium halide compounds. Binary metal halides represent some of the most fundamental of inorganic compounds. The synthesis of new technetium halides demonstrates trends with structure, coordination number, and speciation that can be utilized in the nuclear fuel cycle. Examples are provided for technetium-zirconium alloys as waste forms and the formation of reduced technetium species in separations.","American Chemical Society (ACS)","","Lawrence Livermore National Lab.

The Fukushima Daiichi nuclear power plant suffered exten­sive and irreversible damage. Six operating units were at the site, each with a boiling water reactor. When the earthquake struck, three of the six reactors were operating and the others were in a periodic inspection outage phase. In one reactor, all of the fuel had been relocated to a spent fuel pool in the reactor building. The seismic acceleration caused by the earthquake brought the three operating units to an automatic shutdown. Since there was damage to the power transmission lines, the emergency diesel generators (EDG) were automat­ically started to ensure continued cooling of the reactors and spent fuel pools. The situation was under control until the tsunami hit about forty-five minutes later with a maximum wave height of approximately 15 meters, which was three times taller than the sea wall of 5m. The influx of water submerged the EDGs, the electrical switchgear, and dc batteries, resulting in the total loss of power to five of the six reactors. The flooding also resulted in the loss of instrumentation that would have other­ wise been used to monitor and control the emergency. The ugly aftermath included high radiation exposure to operators at the nuclear power plants and early contamina­tion of food supplies and water within several restricted areas in Japan, where high radiation levels have rendered them un­safe for human habitation. While the rest of the story will remain a tragic history, it is this part of the series of unfortunate events that has inspired our research. It has indubitably highlighted the need for a novel sensor and instrumentation system that can withstand similar or worse conditions to avoid future catastrophe and assume damage prevention as quickly as possible. This is the question which we are attempting to answer: Is it possible to implement a self-powered sensor that could transmit data independently of electronic networks while taking advantage of the harsh operating environment of the nuclear reactor?","","","Idaho National Lab.

R.; Egeland, Gerald W.; Zuck, Larry D.; Jewell, James K.; Akers, Douglas W.; Groenewold, Gary S.","11 NUCLEAR FUEL CYCLE AND FUEL MATERIALS; Green Strength; MA-MOX; Nuclear Fuel; Organic Binders; Radiation Damage","The fracture strength of green Minor Actinides (MA)-MOX pellets containing 75 wt.% DUO2, 20 wt. % PuO2, 3 wt. % AmO2 and 2 wt. % NpO2 was studied as a function of storage time, after mixing in the binder and before sintering, to test the effect of radiation damage on binders. Fracture strength degraded continuously over the 10 days of the study for all three binders studied: PEG binder (Carbowax 8000), microcrystalline wax (Mobilcer X) and Styrene-acrylic copolymer (Duramax B1022) but the fracture strength of Duramax B1022 degraded the least. For instance, for several hours after mixing Carbowax 8000 with MA MOX, the fracture strength of a pellet was reasonably high and pellets were easily handled without breaking but the pellets were too weak to handle after 10 days. Strength measured using diametral compression test showed strength degradation was more rapid in pellets containing 1.0 wt. % Carbowax PEG 8000 compared to those containing only 0.2 wt. %, suggesting that irradiation not only left the binder less effective but also reduced the pellet strength. In contrast the strength of pellets containing Duramax B1022 degraded very little over the 10 day period. It was suggested that the styrene portion of the Duramax B1022 copolymer provided the radiation resistance.","","","Idaho National Lab.

However, an efficient separation requires tight control of the pH which likely will be difficult to achieve on a large scale. To address this issue, we measured the distribution of lanthanide and actinide elements between aqueous and organic phases in the presence of complexants which were potentially less sensitive to pH control than the diethylenetriaminepentaacetic (DTPA) used in the process. To perform the extractions, a rapid and accurate method was developed for measuring distribution coefficients based on the preparation of lanthanide tracers in the Savannah River National Laboratory neutron activation analysis facility. The complexants tested included aceto-, benzo-, and salicylhydroxamic acids, N,N,N&#x27;,N&#x27;-tetrakis(2-pyridylmethyl)ethylenediamine (TPEN), and ammonium thiocyanate (NH{sub 4}SCN). The hydroxamic acids were the least effective of the complexants tested. The separation factors for TPEN and NH{sub 4}SCN were higher, especially for the heaviest lanthanides in the series; however, no conditions were identified which resulted in separations factors which consistently approached those measured for the use of DTPA.","","","Savannah River Site (SRS), Aiken, SC (United States)","USDOE (United States)","","United States","2013-04-15T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: Journal of Radioanalytical and Nuclear Chemistry; Journal Volume: 296; Journal Issue: 2","","Medium: ED; Size: 631","","SRNL-STI-2012-00415","DE-AC09-08SR22470","Journal ID: ISSN 0236--5731; TRN: US1300111","10.1007/s10967-012-2086-2","","2014-04-03T00:00:00Z","1073619","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/1073619","https://www.osti.gov/servlets/purl/1073619","Journal of Radioanalytical and Nuclear Chemistry","2","296"

An empirical model has been developed based on the calibration of the LSDS to responses generated from the simulated assay of six well-characterized fuel assemblies. The effects of self-shielding are taken into account by using empirical basis vectors calculated from the singular value decomposition (SVD) of a matrix containing the self-shielding functions from the assay of assemblies in the calibration set. The performance of the empirical algorithm was tested on version 1 of the Next-Generation Safeguards Initiative (NGSI) used fuel library consisting of 64 assemblies, as well as a set of 27 diversion assemblies, both of which were developed by Los Alamos National Laboratory.

Prior to ion irradiation it was found that the crystallinity of TiO2 layers depends on the individual layer thickness: While all TiO2 layers are amorphous at 5 nm individual layer thickness, at 100 nm they are crystalline with a rutile polymorph. After He+ irradiation up to ~6 dpa at room temperature, amorphization of TiO2 layers was not observed in both nanocrystalline TiO2 single layers and Fe–TiO2 multilayers. The suppression of radiation-induced amorphization in TiO2 is interpreted in terms of a high density of defect sinks in these nano-composites in the form of Fe–TiO2 interphase boundaries and columnar grains within each layer with nano-scale intercolumnar porosity. In addition, a high concentration of He is believed to be trapped at these interfaces in the form of sub-nanometer-scale clusters retarding the formation of relatively larger He bubbles that can be resolved in TEM.","Elsevier","","Energy Frontier Research Centers (EFRC) (United States).

In the current work, a quantitative comparison between C1 Hermite and C0 Lagrange elements is carried out using a continuous Galerkin FEM formulation. The different discretizations are evaluated using the method of manufactured solutions solved with Newton’s method and Jacobian-Free Newton Krylov. It is found that the use of linear Lagrange elements provides the fastest computation time for a given number of elements, while the use of cubic Hermite elements provides the lowest error.

"Measurements and Analysis of Oxygen Bubble Distributions in LiCl-KCl Molten Salt","Bezzant, Ryan W.; Phongikaroon, Supathorn; Simpson, Michael F.","11 NUCLEAR FUEL CYCLE AND FUEL MATERIALS; bubbles; molten salt; pyroprocessing","Transparent system experimental studies have been performed to provide measurement and analysis of oxygen bubble distributions and mass transfer coefficients at different sparging rates ranging from 0.05 to 0.20 L/min in LiCl-KCl molten salt at 500 degrees C using a high-speed digital camera and an oxygen sensor. The results reveal that bubble sizes and rise velocities increased with an increase in oxygen sparging rate. The bubbles observed were ellipsoidal in shape, and an equivalent diameter based on the ellipsoid volume was calculated. The average equivalent bubble diameters at 500 degrees C and these oxygen sparging rates range from 2.63 to 4.07 mm. Results show that the bubble equivalent diameters at each respective sparging rate are normally distributed. A Fanning friction factor correlation was produced to predict a bubble’s rise velocity based on its equivalent diameter. The oxygen mass transfer coefficients for four sparging rates were calculated using the oxygenation model. These calculated values were within the order of magnitude of 10-2 cm/sec and followed a decreasing trend corresponding to an increasing bubble size and sparging rate. The diffusivities were calculated based on two different types of mechanisms, one based on physics of the bubbles and the other on systematic properties. The results reveal that diffusivity values calculated from bubble physics are 1.65 to 8.40 x 10-5 cm2/sec, which are within the range suggested by literature for gases in liquids of a similar viscosity.","","","Idaho National Lab.

"Fuel Cycle System Analysis Implications of Sodium-Cooled Metal-Fueled Fast Reactor Transuranic Conversion Ratio","Piet, Steven J; Hoffman, Edward A; Bays, Samuel E; Matthern, Gretchen E; Jacobson, Jacob J; Clement, Ryan; Gerts, David W","11 NUCLEAR FUEL CYCLE AND FUEL MATERIALS; Breeding ratio; conversion ratio; Fast reactor; Fuel cycles; transuranic elements","If advanced fuel cycles are to include a large number of fast reactors (FRs), what should be the transuranic (TRU) conversion ratio (CR)? The nuclear energy era started with the assumption that they should be breeder reactors (CR > 1), but the full range of possible CRs eventually received attention. For example, during the recent U.S. Global Nuclear Energy Partnership program, the proposal was burner reactors (CR < 1). Yet, more recently, Massachusetts Institute of Technology's ""Future of the Nuclear Fuel Cycle"" proposed CR [approximately] 1. Meanwhile, the French company EDF remains focused on breeders. At least one of the reasons for the differences of approach is different fuel cycle objectives. To clarify matters, this paper analyzes the impact of TRU CR on many parameters relevant to fuel cycle systems and therefore spans a broad range of topic areas. The analyses are based on a FR physics parameter scan of TRU CR from 0 to [approximately]1.8 in a sodium-cooled metal-fueled FR (SMFR), in which the fuel from uranium-oxide-fueled light water reactors (LWRs) is recycled directly to FRs and FRs displace LWRs in the fleet. In this instance, the FRs are sodium cooled and metal fueled. Generally, it is assumed that all TRU elements are recycled, which maximizes uranium ore utilization for a given TRU CR and waste radiotoxicity reduction and is consistent with the assumption of used metal fuel separated by electrochemical means. In these analyses, the fuel burnup was constrained by imposing a neutron fluence limit to fuel cladding to the same constant value. This paper first presents static, time-independent measures of performance for the LWR [right arrow] FR fuel cycle, including mass, heat, gamma emission, radiotoxicity, and the two figures of merit for materials for weapon attractiveness developed by C. Bathke et al. No new fuel cycle will achieve a static equilibrium in the foreseeable future. Therefore, additional analyses are shown with dynamic, time-dependent measures of performance including uranium usage, TRU inventory, and radiotoxicity to evaluate the complex impacts of transition from the current uranium-fueled LWR system, and other more realistic impacts that may not be intuited from the time-independent steady-state conditions of the end-state fuel cycle. These analyses were performed using the Verifiable Fuel Cycle Simulation Model VISION. Compared with static calculations, dynamic results paint a different picture of option space and the urgency of starting a FR fleet. For example, in a static analysis, there is a sharp increase in uranium utilization as CR exceeds 1.0 (burner versus breeder). However, in dynamic analyses that examine uranium use over the next 1 to 2 centuries, behavior as CR crosses the 1.0 threshold is smooth, and other parameters such as the time required outside of reactors to recycle fuel become important. Overall, we find that there is no unambiguously superior value of TRU CR; preferences depend on the relative importance of different fuel cycle system objectives.","","","Idaho National Lab.

"Assessment of Possible Cycle Lengths for Fully Encapsulated Microstructure fueled light water reactor Concepts","Sen, R Sonat; Pope, Michael A; Ougouag, Abderrafi M; Pasamehmetoglu, Kemal O","11 NUCLEAR FUEL CYCLE AND FUEL MATERIALS; FCM; PWR; TRISO; UN","The use of TRISO-particle-based dispersion fuel within SiC matrix and cladding materials has the potential to allow the design of extremely safe LWRs with failure-proof fuel. This paper examines the feasibility of LWR-like cycle length for such fuel with the imposed constraint of strictly retaining the original geometry of the fuel pins and assemblies. The motivation for retaining the original geometry is to provide the ability to incorporate the fuel “as-is” into existing LWRs while retaining their thermal–hydraulic characteristics. Another mandatory constraint is use of low enriched uranium (at or below 20 w/o). The feasibility of using this fuel is assessed by looking at two factors: cycle lengths and fuel material failure rates. Other considerations (e.g., safety parameters such as reactivity coefficients, feedback, etc.) were not considered at this stage of the study. The study includes the examination of increases in the TRISO kernel sizes without changing the thickness of any of the coating layers. In addition, cases where the buffer layer thickness is allowed to vary are also considered. The study shows that a naïve use of UO2 (even up to 20 w/o enrichment) results in cycle lengths too short to be practical for existing LWR designs and operational demands. Increasing fissile inventory within the fuel compacts shows that acceptable cycle lengths can be achieved. The increase of fissile inventory can be accomplished through multiple means, including higher particle packing fraction, higher enrichment, larger fuel kernel sizes, and the use of higher density fuels (that contain a higher number of U atoms per unit volume). In this study, starting with the recognized highest packing fraction practically achievable (44%), combinations of the other means have been evaluated. The models demonstrate cycle lengths comparable to those of ordinary LWRs. As expected, TRISO particles with extremely large kernels are shown to fail under all considered scenarios. In contrast, the designs that do not depart too drastically from those of the nominal NGNP HTR fuel TRISO particles are shown to perform satisfactorily and display a high rates of survival under all considered scenarios.","","","Idaho National Lab.

It was demonstrated that individual fission product chloride salts were absorbed by zeolite-A in a solid-state process. As a result, recycling of LiCl-KCl appears feasible via adding a zone-freezing technique to the current treatment process. Ternary salt molten-state experiments showed the limiting kinetics of CsCl and SrCl2 sorption into the zeolite. CsCl sorption occurred rapidly relative to SrCl2 with no observed dependence on zeolite particle size, while SrCl2 sorption was highly dependent on particle size. The application of experimental data to a developed reaction-diffusion-based sorption model yielded diffusivities of 8.04 × 10-6 and 4.04 × 10-7 cm2 /s for CsCl and SrCl2, respectively. Additionally, the chemical reaction term in the developed model was found to be insignificant compared to the diffusion term.","","","Idaho National Lab.

In this work, molecular dynamics (MD) simulation is employed to determine the GB mobility using Cu bicrystals. Two grain configurations are considered: a shrinking circular grain and a half loop grain. The results obtained from the half loop configuration approaches asymptotically to that obtained from the circular configuration with increasing half loop width. We then verify the phase- field model by directly comparing to the MD simulation results, obtaining excellent agreement. Next, this phase-field model is used to predict the behavior in a common experimental setup that utilizes a half loop grain configuration in a bicrystal to measure the GB mobility. With a 3D simulation, we identify the two critical times within the experiments to reach an accurate value of the GB mobility. We use a series of 2D simulations to investigate the impact of the notch angle on these two critical times and we identify an angle of 60? as an optimal value. We also show that if the notch does not have a sharp tip, it may immobilize the GB migration indefinitely.","","","Idaho National Lab.

"Separation of CsCl from a Ternary CsCl-LiCl-KCl Salt via a Melt Crystallization Technique for Pyroprocessing Waste Minimization","Williams, Ammon; Phongikaroon, Supathorn; Simpson, Michael","11 NUCLEAR FUEL CYCLE AND FUEL MATERIALS; electrorefining; molten salt; zone freezing","A parametric study has been conducted to identify the effects of several parameters on the separation of CsCl from molten LiCl-KCl salt via a melt crystallization process. A reverse vertical Bridgman technique was used to grow the salt crystals. The investigated parameters were: (1) the advancement rate, (2) the crucible lid configuration, (3) the amount of salt mixture, (4) the initial composition of CsCl, and (5) the temperature difference between the high and low furnace zones. From each grown crystal, samples were taken axially and analyzed using inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry (ICP-MS). Results show that CsCl concentrations at the top of the crystals were low and increased to a maximum at the bottom of the salt. Salt (LiCl-KCl) recycle percentages for the experiments ranged from 50% to 75% and the CsCl composition in the waste salt was low. To increase the recycle percentage and the concentration of CsCl in the waste form, the possibility of using multiple crystallization stages was explored to further optimize the process. Results show that multiple crystallization stages are practical and the optimal experimental conditions should be operated at 5.0 mm/hr rate with a lid configuration and temperature difference of 200 °C for a total of five crystallization stages. Under these conditions, up to 88% of the salt can be recycled.","","","Idaho National Lab.

"Theoretical Insights into Covalency Driven f Element Separations","Roy, Lindsay E.; Bridges, Nicholas J.; Martin, Leigh R.","11 NUCLEAR FUEL CYCLE AND FUEL MATERIALS; Density Functional Theory; TALSPEAK","The lanthanide series, Am, and Cm are predominantly found in the trivalent oxidation state in aqueous solutions making their separation very difficult to achieve. To date, one of the mostly promising separation processes for transplutonium elements from the lanthanides is the TALSPEAK process. Though the mechanism of the TALSPEAK process is not fully understood, it has been demonstrated to provide excellent separation factors between the lanthanides and the trivalent lanthanides. Through Density Function Theory (DFT) calculations of di 2-ethylenetriamine-N,N,N',N”,N”-pentaacetic acid (DTPA), we set out to understand the structures and stabilities of the aqueous phase complexes [MIII(DTPA)-H2O]2- (M = Nd, Am) as well as the changes in Gibbs free energy for complexation in the gas phase and aqueous solution. Mulliken population analysis, Bader’s Atoms-in-Molecules (AIM) approach, and Natural Bond Orbital (NBO) analysis were then used to analyze the bonding in both molecules. The results discussed below suggest that the preference of the DTPA5- ligand for Am over Nd is mainly due to electrostatic and covalent interactions from the oxygen atoms with the nitrogen chelates provide an additional, yet small, covalent interaction. These results question the exclusive use of hard and soft acids and bases (HSAB) concepts for the design of extracting reagents and suggest that hard-soft interactions play more of a role in the separations process than previously thought.","","","Idaho National Lab.

"When Is the Simple Radiotoxicity Approach Useful for Advanced Fuel Cycle System Assessments Given the Existence of Complex Performance Dose Assessments?","Piet, Steven J.","11 NUCLEAR FUEL CYCLE AND FUEL MATERIALS; Disposal; Fuel cycle; radiotoxicity; Recycling; Waste management","Engineers often face the general question of which approximations are appropriate for a given analytical task. In particular, when is a simpler model useful if a more complex model also exists? This paper explores this question in the domain of radiotoxicity relative to geologic disposal performance dose assessments. Criterion 1 requires that the simpler approach, radiotoxicity, must be calculated correctly. The concept of ingestion radiotoxic inventories is analogous to the inventory of toxic chemicals in other industries. From a decision analysis perspective, it is also somewhat analogous to the nuclear reactor safety concept of “passive safety.” This paper explains some of the issues in calculating radiotoxicity, motivated by the author’s observations of errors in the literature: not accounting for radioactive progeny, misunderstanding natural “ore,” and focusing on transuranic (TRU) isotopes without adequate attention to actinide decay products. For example, Th/233U fuel cycles do have lower amounts of TRU isotopes than U/239Pu fuel cycles, but that does not necessarily mean lower long-term hazard. Criterion 2 requires that the uncertainties in the more complex approach, performance dose assessments, must raise issues for the assessments’ intended purposes—in which case, radiotoxic inventory may be of assistance until those issues are resolved. Performance dose assessments were developed for, and are legally the way to show, compliance with regulations, but the uncertainties are large. Less obvious is the degree to which dose assessments are applicable to other purposes—comparing fuel cycle options prior to site selection and showing the safety of a fuel cycle and waste management approach to the public. In the last sense especially, performance dose assessments are analogous to probabilistic risk assessments for nuclear reactor safety. The United States lacks a selected consensus site, selected fuel cycle approach (direct disposal versus recycling), and selected waste form. Thus, the paper does not intend to discuss all the issues with performance dose assessments but rather intends to focus on only those performance dose uncertainties that raise issues when comparing fuel cycles. Uncertainties associated with whether a generic geological environment is attractive or a specific location meets requirements are beyond the scope of this paper. Ingestion radiotoxicity correlates with heat, gamma, and inhalation radiotoxicity. Thus, options that are relatively high in ingestion radiotoxicity tend to be high in other parameters. Therefore, reduction in ingestion radiotoxicity means both that the potential source term for release is lower but also that one driving force for release (heat) is also lower. However, the most important time frames differ as heat is mainly an issue in decades and centuries after reactor discharge, but ingestion radiotoxicity is mainly an issue during longer time periods. Ingestion radiotoxicity points to the importance of actinides in long-term waste management, followed by specific fission products such as 99Tc, 129I, 93Zr, 135Cs, and 79Se.","American Nuclear Society","","Idaho National Lab.

P.; Marshall, Doug W.","11 NUCLEAR FUEL CYCLE AND FUEL MATERIALS; NGNP + TDO + VHTR + R&D + Fuel + AGR-1 + AG","Current Very High Temperature Reactor (VHTR) designs incorporate TRi-structural ISOtropic (TRISO) fuel, which consists of a spherical fissile fuel kernel surrounded by layers of pyrolytic carbon and silicon carbide. An internal sol-gel process forms the fuel kernel using wet chemistry to produce uranium oxyhydroxide gel spheres by dropping a cold precursor solution into a hot column of trichloroethylene (TCE). Over time, gelation byproducts inhibit complete gelation, and the TCE must be purified or discarded. The resulting TCE waste stream contains both radioactive and hazardous materials and is thus considered a mixed hazardous waste. Changing the forming fluid to a non-hazardous alternative could greatly improve the economics of TRISO fuel kernel production. Selection criteria for a replacement forming fluid narrowed a list of ~10,800 chemicals to yield ten potential replacement forming fluids: 1-bromododecane, 1- bromotetradecane, 1-bromoundecane, 1-chlorooctadecane, 1-chlorotetradecane, 1-iododecane, 1-iodododecane, 1-iodohexadecane, 1-iodooctadecane, and squalane. The density, viscosity, and surface tension for each potential replacement forming fluid were measured as a function of temperature between 25 °C and 80 °C. Calculated settling velocities and heat transfer rates give an overall column height approximation. 1-bromotetradecane, 1-chlorooctadecane, and 1-iodododecane show the greatest promise as replacements, and future tests will verify their ability to form satisfactory fuel kernels.","Elsevier","","Idaho National Lab.

Significant interaction takes place between the U-Mo fuel and Al during manufacturing and in-reactor irradiation. The interactions products are Al-rich phases with physical and thermal characteristics that adversely affect fuel performance and lead to premature failure. Detailed analysis of the interdiffusion and microstructural development of this system was carried through diffusion couples consisting of U-7wt.%Mo, U-10wt.%Mo and U-12wt.%Mo in contact with pure Al, Al-2wt.%Si, and Al-5wt.%Si, annealed at 823K for 1, 5 and 20 hours. Scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and transmission electron microscopy (TEM) were employed for the analysis. Diffusion couples consisting of U-Mo vs. pure Al contained UAl3, UAl4, U6Mo4Al43, and UMo2Al20 phases. The addition of Si to the Al significantly reduced the thickness of the interdiffusion zone. The interdiffusion zones developed Al and Si enriched regions, whose locations and size depended on the Si and Mo concentrations in the terminal alloys. In the couples, the (U,Mo)(Al,Si)3 phase was observed throughout interdiffusion zone, and the U6Mo4Al43 and UMo2Al20 phases were observed only where the Si concentrations were low.","","","Idaho National Lab.

An isothermal test loop was designed to recreate exchange or stratified flow that occurs in the lower plenum of VHTR after a break in the primary loop allows helium to leak out and reactor building air to enter the reactor core. The experiment was designed to measure stratified flow in the inlet pipe connecting to the lower plenum of the General Atomics gas turbine–modular helium reactor (GT-MHR). Instead of helium and air, brine and sucrose were used as heavy fluids, and water was used as the lighter fluid to create, using scaling laws, the appropriate flow characteristics of the lower plenum immediately after depressurization. These results clearly indicate that stratified flow is established even for very small density differences. Corresponding CFD results were validated with the experimental data. A grid sensitivity study on CFD models was also performed using the Richardson extrapolation and the grid convergence index method for the numerical accuracy of CFD calculations. The calculated current speed showed very good agreement with the experimental data, indicating that current CFD methods are suitable for simulating density gradient stratified flow phenomena in an air-ingress accident.","","","Idaho National Lab.

"Projected Salt Waste Production from a Commercial Pyroprocessing Facility","Simpson, Michael F.","11 NUCLEAR FUEL CYCLE AND FUEL MATERIALS; pyroprocessing; salt; waste","<p>Pyroprocessing of used nuclear fuel inevitably produces salt waste from electrorefining and/or oxide reduction unit operations. Various process design characteristics can affect the actual mass of such waste produced. This paper examines both oxide and metal fuel treatment, estimates the amount of salt waste generated, and assesses potential benefit of process options to mitigate the generation of salt waste. For reference purposes, a facility is considered in which 100 MT/year of fuel is processed. Salt waste estimates range from 8 to 20 MT/year from considering numerous scenarios. It appears that some benefit may be derived from advanced processes for separating fission products from molten salt waste, but the degree of improvement is limited. Waste form production is also considered but appears to be economically unfavorable. Direct disposal of salt into a salt basin type repository is found to be the most promising with respect to minimizing the impact of waste generation on the economic feasibility and sustainability of pyroprocessing.</p>","Hindawi","","Idaho National Lab.

"Overview of the international R&D recycling activities of the nuclear fuel cycle","Paviet-Hartmann, Patricia","11 NUCLEAR FUEL CYCLE AND FUEL MATERIALS; back end of the fuel cycle; extraction; minor actinides; nuclear repository; purex; recycling; reprocessing; used nuclear fuel","Nuclear power has demonstrated over the last thirty years its capacity to produce base-load electricity at a low, predictable and stable cost due to the very low economic dependence of the price of uranium. However the management of used nuclear fuel (UNF) remains the “Achilles’ heel of this energy source since the storage of UNF is increasing as evidenced by the following number with 2,000 to 2,300 of UNF produced each year by the 104 US nuclear reactor units which equates to a total of 62,000 UNF assemblies stored in dry cask storage and 88,000 stored in pools. Alarmingly, more than half of US commercial reactor sites have filled their pools to capacity and have had to add dry cask storage facilities. Two options adopted by several countries will be discussed. The first one adopted by Europe, Japan and Russia consists of recycling the used nuclear fuel after irradiation in a nuclear reactor. Ninety six percent of uranium and plutonium contained in the spent fuel could be reused to produce electricity and are worth recycling. The separation of uranium and plutonium from the wastes is realized through the industrial PUREX process so that they can be recycled for re-use in a nuclear reactor as a mixed oxide (MOX) fuel. The second option undertaken by Finland, Sweden and the United States implies the direct disposal of UNF into a geologic formation. One has to remind that only 30% of the worldwide UNF are currently recycled, the larger part being stored (90% in pool) waiting for scientific or political decisions. A third option is emerging with a closed fuel cycle which will improve the global sustainability of nuclear energy. This option will not only decrease the volume amount of nuclear waste but also the long-term radiotoxicity of the final waste, as well as improving the long-term safety and the heat-loading of the final repository. At the present time, numerous countries are focusing on the R&D recycling activities of the ultimate waste composed of fission products and minor actinides (americium and curium). Several new chemical extraction processes, such as TRUSPEAK, EXAM, or LUCA processes are pursued worldwide and their approaches will be highlighted.","","","Idaho National Lab.

Accident tolerant fuels have been specifically described as fuels that, in comparison with standard UO2-Zircaloy, can tolerate loss of active cooling in the reactor core for a considerably longer time period (depending on the LWR system and accident scenario) while maintaining or improving the fuel performance during normal operations, operational transients, as well as design-basis and beyond design-basis events.

Significant reactions have been observed between U-Mo fuels and Al or Al alloy matrix. Refractory metal Zr has been proposed as barrier material to reduce the interactions. In order to investigate the compatibility and barrier effects between U-Mo alloy and Zr, solid-to-solid U-10wt.%Mo vs. Zr diffusion couples were assembled and annealed at 600, 700, 800, 900 and 1000 °C for various times. The microstructures and concentration profiles due to interdiffusion and reactions were examined via scanning electron microscopy and electron probe microanalysis, respectively. Intermetallic phase Mo2Zr was found at the interface and its population increased when annealing temperature decreased. Diffusion paths were also plotted on the U-Mo-Zr ternary phase diagrams with good consistency. The growth rate of interdiffusion zone between U-10wt.%Mo and Zr was also calculated under the assumption of parabolic diffusion, and was determined to be about 103 times lower than the growth rate of diffusional interaction layer found in diffusion couples U-10wt.%Mo vs. Al or Al-Si alloy. Other desirable physical properties of Zr as barrier material, such as neutron adsorption rate, melting point and thermal conductivity are presented as supplementary information to demonstrate the great potential of Zr as the diffusion barrier for U-Mo fuel systems in RERTR.","","","Idaho National Lab.

"The Partitioning of Americium and the Lanthanides Using Tetrabutyldiglycolamide (TBDGA) in Octanol and in Ionic Liquid Solution","Mincher, M E; Quach, D L; Liao, Y J; Mincher, B J; Wai, C M","11 NUCLEAR FUEL CYCLE AND FUEL MATERIALS; americium; diamides; ionic liquids; lanthanides; rare earths","Separations among the lanthanides and the separation of Am from the lanthanides remain challenging, and research in this area continues to expand. The separation of adjacent lanthanides is of interest to high-tech industries because individual lanthanides have specialized uses and are in short supply. In nuclear fuel cycle applications Am would be incorporated into fast reactor fuels, yet the lanthanides are not desired. In this work the diamide N,N,N',N'-tetrabutyldiglycolamide (TBDGA) was investigated as a ligand for lanthanide and Am solvent extraction in both molecular and room temperature ionic liquid (RTIL) diluents. The RTIL [C4MIM][Tf2N-] showed very high extraction efficiency for these trivalent metals from low nitric acid concentrations, while the molecular diluent 1-octanol showed high extraction efficiency at high acid concentrations. This was attributed to the extraction of ionic nitrate complexes by the RTIL, whereas 1-octanol extracted neutral nitrate complexes. TBDGA in RTIL did not provide adequate separation factors for Am/lanthanide partitioning, but 1-octanol did show reasonable separation possibilities. Lanthanide intergroup separations appeared to be feasible in both diluents, but with higher separation factors from 1-octanol.","","","Idaho National Lab.

"Neutronic Analysis of the Burning of Transuranics in Fully Ceramic Micro-Encapsulated Tri-Isotropic Particle-Fuel in a PWR","Pope, Michael A; Sen, R Sonat; Ougouag, Abderrafi M; Youinou, Gilles; Boer, Brian","11 NUCLEAR FUEL CYCLE AND FUEL MATERIALS; FCM; Fully-Encapsulated; Microstructure; PWR; Transuranics; TRISO; TRU","Calculations have been performed to assess the neutronic behavior of pins of Fully-Ceramic Micro-encapsulated (FCM) fuel in otherwise-conventional Pressurized Water Reactor (PWR) fuel pins. The FCM fuel contains transuranic (TRU) – only oxide fuel in tri-isotropic (TRISO) particles with the TRU loading coming from the spent fuel of a conventional LWR after 5 years of cooling. Use of the TRISO particle fuel would provide an additional barrier to fission product release in the event of cladding failure. Depletion calculations were performed to evaluate reactivity-limited burnup of the TRU-only FCM fuel. These calculations showed that due to relatively little space available for fuel, the achievable burnup with these pins alone is quite small. Various reactivity parameters were also evaluated at each burnup step including moderator temperature coefficient (MTC), Doppler, and soluble boron worth. These were compared to reference UO2 and MOX unit cells. The TRU-only FCM fuel exhibits degraded MTC and Doppler coefficients relative to UO2 and MOX. Also, the reactivity effects of coolant voiding suggest that the behavior of this fuel would be similar to a MOX fuel of very high plutonium fraction, which are known to have positive void reactivity. In general, loading of TRU-only FCM fuel into an assembly without significant quantities of uranium presents challenges to the reactor design. However, if such FCM fuel pins are included in a heterogeneous assembly alongside LEU fuel pins, the overall reactivity behavior is dominated by the uranium pins while attractive TRU destruction performance levels in the TRU-only FCM fuel pins is. From this work, it is concluded that use of heterogeneous assemblies such as these appears feasible from a preliminary reactor physics standpoint.","","","Idaho National Lab.

"Using eigenmodes to perform the inverse problem associated with resonant ultrasound spectroscopy","Hurley, David; Farzbod, Farhad","11 NUCLEAR FUEL CYCLE AND FUEL MATERIALS; crystal orientation; eigenvectors; laser; resonant ultrasound spectroscopy","In principle, resonant ultrasonic spectroscopy (RUS) can be used to characterize any parameter that influences the mechanical resonant response of a sample. Examples include the elastic constants, sample dimensions, and crystal orientation. Extracting the parameter of interest involves performing the inverse problem, which typically entails an iterative routine that compares calculated and measured eigenfrequencies. Here, we propose an alternative method based on laser-based resonant ultrasound spectroscopy (LRUS) that uses the eigenmodes. LRUS uses a pulsed laser to thermoelastically excite ultrasound and an interferometer to detect out-of-plane displacement associated with ultrasonic resonances. By raster scanning the probe along the sample surface, an image of the out-ofplane displacement pattern (i.e., eigenmode) is obtained. As an example of this method, we describe a technique to calculate the crystallographic orientation of a single-crystal high-purity copper sample. The crystallographic orientation is computed by comparing theoretical and experimental eigenmodes. The computed angle is shown to be in very good agreement with the angle obtained using electron backscatter diffraction. In addition, a comparison is made using eigenfrequencies and eigenmodes to calculate the crystallographic orientation. It is found for this particular application, the eigenmode method has superior sensitivity to crystal orientation.","","","Idaho National Lab.

An extensive post-irradiation examination (PIE) campaign will be conducted on the AGR-1 fuel in order to characterize the irradiated fuel properties, assess the in-pile fuel performance in terms of coating integrity and fission metals release, and determine the fission product retention behavior during high temperature safety testing. A new furnace system has been designed, built, and tested to perform high temperature accident tests. The Fuel Accident Condition Simulator furnace system is designed to heat fuel specimens at temperatures up to 2000 degrees C in helium while monitoring the release of volatile fission metals (e.g. Cs, Ag, Sr, and Eu), iodine, and fission gases (Kr, Xe). Fission gases released from the fuel to the sweep gas are monitored in real time using dual cryogenic traps fitted with high purity germanium detectors. Condensable fission products are collected on a plate attached to a water-cooled cold finger that can be exchanged periodically without interrupting the test. Analysis of fission products on the condensation plates involves dry gamma counting followed by chemical analysis of selected isotopes. This paper will describe design and operational details of the Fuel Accident Condition Simulator furnace system and the associated fission gas monitoring system, as well as preliminary system calibration results.","","","Idaho National Lab.

This study describes the work done on un-irradiated SiC samples prepared with varying phosphorus levels to simulate the presence of phosphorus due to transmutation. 30Si transmutes to phosphorous (31P) and other transmutation products during irradiation, which may affect the integrity of the SiC layer. The P-doping levels of the SiC samples used in this study cover the range from 1.1x1015 to 1.2x1019 at/cm3 and are therefore relevant to the PBMR operating conditions. Annealing from 1000 C to 2100 C was performed to study the possible changes in nanostructures and various properties due to temperature. Characterization results by X-ray diffraction (XRD), secondary ion mass spectrometry (SIMS), scanning electron microscopy (SEM), transmission electron microscopy (TEM) and high resolution transmission electron microscopy (HRTEM), are reported in this article. As grain boundary diffusion is identified as a possible mechanism by which 110mAg, one of the fission activation products, might be released through intact SiC layer, grain size measurements is also included in this study. Temperature is evidently one of the factors/parameters amongst others known to influence the grain size of SiC and therefore it is important to investigate the effect of high temperature annealing on the SiC grain size. The ASTM E112 method as well as electron back scatter diffraction (EBSD) was used to determine the grain size of various commercial SiC samples and the SiC layer in experimental PBMR Coated Particles (CPs) after annealing at temperatures ranging from 1600 C to 2100 C. The HRTEM micrograph of the decomposition of SiC at 2100 C are shown and discussed. Nanotubes were not identified during the TEM and HRTEM analysis although graphitic structures were identified. The preliminary conclusion reached is that the P-content at these experimental levels (1.1x1015 - 1.2x1019 atom/cm3) does not have a significant influence on the nanostructure of SiC at high temperatures without irradiation.","","","Idaho National Lab.

"FABRICATION OF URANIUM OXYCARBIDE KERNELS AND COMPACTS FOR HTR FUEL","Phillips, Jeffrey A; Shaber, Eric L; Nagley, Scott G","11 NUCLEAR FUEL CYCLE AND FUEL MATERIALS; NGNP + TDO + VHTR + R&D + Fuel + AGR-1 + AG","As part of the program to demonstrate tristructural isotropic (TRISO)-coated fuel for the Next Generation Nuclear Plant (NGNP), Advanced Gas Reactor (AGR) fuel is being irradiation tested in the Advanced Test Reactor (ATR) at Idaho National Laboratory (INL). This testing has led to improved kernel fabrication techniques, the formation of TRISO fuel particles, and upgrades to the overcoating, compaction, and heat treatment processes. Combined, these improvements provide a fuel manufacturing process that meets the stringent requirements associated with testing in the AGR experimentation program. Researchers at Idaho National Laboratory (INL) are working in conjunction with a team from Babcock and Wilcox (B&W) and Oak Ridge National Laboratory (ORNL) to (a) improve the quality of uranium oxycarbide (UCO) fuel kernels, (b) deposit TRISO layers to produce a fuel that meets or exceeds the standard developed by German researches in the 1980s, and (c) develop a process to overcoat TRISO particles with the same matrix material, but applies it with water using equipment previously and successfully employed in the pharmaceutical industry. A primary goal of this work is to simplify the process, making it more robust and repeatable while relying less on operator technique than prior overcoating efforts. A secondary goal is to improve first-pass yields to greater than 95% through the use of established technology and equipment. In the first test, called “AGR-1,” graphite compacts containing approximately 300,000 coated particles were irradiated from December 2006 to November 2009. The AGR-1 fuel was designed to closely replicate many of the properties of German TRISO-coated particles, thought to be important for good fuel performance. No release of gaseous fission product, indicative of particle coating failure, was detected in the nearly 3-year irradiation to a peak burn up of 19.6% at a time-average temperature of 1038–1121°C. Before fabricating AGR-2 fuel, each fabrication process was improved and changed. Changes to the kernel fabrication process included replacing the carbon black powder feed with a surface-modified carbon slurry and shortening the sintering schedule. AGR-2 TRISO particles were produced in a 6-inch diameter coater using a charge size about 21-times that of the 2-inch diameter coater used to coat AGR-1 particles. The compacting process was changed to increase matrix density and throughput by increasing the temperature and pressure of pressing and using a different type of press. AGR-2 fuel began irradiation in the ATR in late spring 2010.","","","Idaho National Lab.

The ultimate goal is to implement TiN as an effective diffusion barrier to prevent the inter-diffusion between the nuclear fuel and the cladding material, and thus lead to a longer life time of the cladding tubes. Mechanical tests including hardness and scratch tests for the samples before and after thermal cycle tests show that the films have a high hardness of 28 GPa and excellent adhesion properties despite the thermal treatment. Thermal conductivity measurements demonstrate that the thin TiN films have very minimal impact on the overall thermal conductivity of the MA957 and HT9 substrates, i.e., the thermal conductivity of the uncoated HT-9 and MA957 substrates was 26.25 and 28.44 W m-1K-1 , and that of the coated ones was 26.21 and 28.38 W m-1K-1, respectively.

"AGR-2: The first irradiation of French HTR fuel in Advanced Test Reactor","Lambert, T; Grover, B; Guillermier, P; Moulinier, D; Huart, F Imbault","11 NUCLEAR FUEL CYCLE AND FUEL MATERIALS; Advanced Test Reactor; AGR-2; French HTR Fuel","AGR-2, the second irradiation of the US program for qualification of the NGNP fuel, is open to international participation within the scope of the Generation IV International Forum. In this frame, it includes in its multi-capsule irradiation rig an irradiation of French HTR fuel manufactured in the CAPRI line (GAIA facility at CEA/Cadarache and AREVA/CERCA compacting line at Romans). The AGR-2 irradiation is designed to place our first fabrications of HTR particles under operating conditions that are representative of ANTARES project while keeping close to the test range of the German fuel as much as possible, which is the reference in terms of irradiation behavior. A few batches of particles and 12 fuel compacts were produced and characterized in 2009 by CEA and CERCA. The fuel main characteristics are in conformity with our specifications and in compliance with INL requirements. The AGR-2 experiment is based on the design and devices used in the first experiment of the AGR program. The design makes it possible to monitor the irradiation conditions and in particular, the temperature, the power and the fission products released from fuel particles. The in pile equipment consists of a multi-capsule device designed to simultaneously irradiate six independent capsules with temperature control. The out-of-core part consists of the equipment for actively controlling temperature and measuring the fission products release on-line. The target conditions for the irradiation experiment were defined with the aim of comparing the results obtained under irradiation with German particles along with the objectives of reaching burn-up and fluence targets to validate the behavior of our fuel in a significant range (15% FIMA – 5 × 1025 n/m2 at 600 EFPD with centerline fuel temperature about 1100 degrees C). These conditions have to be representative of ANTARES project characteristics. These target conditions were compared with final results from neutron and thermal design studies performed by INL team, and preliminary thermal mechanical ATLAS calculations were carried out by CEA from this pre-design. Despite the mean burn-up achieved in approximately 600 EFPD being a little high (16.3% FIMA max. associated with a low fluence up to 2.85 × 1025 n/m2), this irradiation will nevertheless encompass the range of irradiation effects covered in our experimental objectives (maximum stress peak at start of irradiation then sign inversion of the stress in the SiC layer). In addition, the fluence and burn-up acceleration factors are very similar to those of the German reference experiments. This experimental irradiation began in July 2010 in the Advanced Test Reactor (ATR) at the Idaho National Laboratory (INL) and first results have been acquired.","","","Idaho National Lab.

Drawdown reaction selectivity is a major issue that needs to be investigated, since the goal is to remove actinides while leaving the fission products in the salt. A series of lithium drawdown tests with surrogate fission product chlorides was run to obtain selectivity data with non-radioactive salts, develop a predictive model, and draw conclusions about the viability of using this process with actinide-loadd salt. Results of tests with CsCl, LaCl3, CeCl3, and NdCl3 are reported here. An equilibrium model has been formulated and fit to the experimental data. Excellent fits to the data were achieved. Based on analysis and results obtained to date, it is concluded that clean separation between minor actinides and lanthanides will be difficult to achieve using lithium drawdown.","","","Idaho National Lab.

It is envisioned that a steam generator would operate with reactor outlet temperatures from 750 to 800 C, while an intermediate heat exchanger for primary to secondary helium would operate up to an outlet temperature of 950 C. Although both alloys are of interest due in part to their technical maturity, a number of specific properties require further characterization for design of nuclear components. Strain rate sensitivity of both alloys has been characterized and is found to be significant above 600 C. Both alloys also exhibit dynamic strain aging, characterized by serrated flow, over a wide range of temperatures and strain rates. High temperature tensile testing of Alloy 617 has been conducted over a range of temperatures. Dynamic strain aging is a concern for these materials since it is observed to result in reduced ductility for many solid solution alloys. Creep, fatigue, and creep-fatigue properties of Alloy 617 have been measured as well, with the goal of determining the influence of the temperature, strain rate and atmosphere on the creep fatigue life of Alloy 617.

In this paper are illustrated some aspects of the modeling of fast centrifuges for UF{sub 6} gas enrichment and of a typical cascade enrichment plant with the Theoretical Centrifuge and Cascade Simulator (TCCS). The background theory for reproducing the flow field characteristics of a centrifuge is derived from the work of Cohen where the separation parameters are calculated using the solution of a differential enrichment equation. In our case we chose to solve the hydrodynamic equations for the motion of a compressible fluid in a centrifugal field using the Berman - Olander vertical velocity radial distribution and the solution was obtained using the Matlab software tool. The importance of a correct estimation of the centrifuge separation parameters at different flow regimes, lies in the possibility to estimate in a reliable way the U enrichment plant performances, once the separation external parameters are set (feed flow rate and feed, product and tails assays). Using the separation parameters of a single centrifuge allow to determine the performances of an entire cascade and, for this purpose; the software Simulink was used. The outputs of the calculation are the concentrations (assays) and the flow rates of the enriched (product) and depleted (tails) gas mixture. These models represent a valid additional tool, in order to verify the compliance of the U enrichment plant operator declarations with the 'on site' inspectors' measurements.","","","","","","United States","2012-09-26T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","Conference","Journal Name: AIP Conference Proceedings; Journal Volume: 1479; Journal Issue: 1; Conference: ICNAAM 2012: International Conference of Numerical Analysis and Applied Mathematics, Kos (Greece), 19-25 Sep 2012; Other Information: (c) 2012 American Institute of Physics; Country of input: International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA)","","Medium: X; Size: page(s) 201-204","","","","Journal ID: ISSN 0094-243X; CODEN: APCPCS; TRN: US13A1678034628","10.1063/1.4756097","","2013-04-12T00:00:00Z","22075543","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/22075543","","AIP Conference Proceedings","1","1479"

"Conceptual Study on Air Ingress Mitigation for VHTRs","Oh, Chang H; Kim, Eung S","11 NUCLEAR FUEL CYCLE AND FUEL MATERIALS; Cavity Enclosure; Helium Injection; Very High Temperature Reactor; VHTR","An air-ingress accident followed by a pipe break is considered as a critical event for a very high temperature gas-cooled reactor (VHTR) safety. Following helium depressurization, it is anticipated that unless countermeasures are taken, air will enter the core through the break leading to oxidation of the in-core graphite structure. Thus, without mitigation features, this accident might lead to severe exothermic chemical reactions of graphite and oxygen depending on the accident scenario and the design. Under extreme circumstances, a loss of core structural integrity may occur and lead to a detrimental situation for the VHTR safety. This paper discusses various air-ingress mitigation concepts applicable for the VHTRs. The study begins with identifying important factors (or phenomena) associated with the air-ingress accident using a root-cause analysis. By preventing main causes of the important events identified in the root-cause diagram, the basic air-ingress mitigation ideas were conceptually developed. Among them, two concepts were finally evaluated as effective candidates. One concept is to inject helium into the lower plenum which is a direct in-vessel helium injection. The other concept is to enclose the reactor with a non-pressure boundary consisting of an opening at the bottom, which is an ex-vessel enclosure boundary. Computational fluid dynamics (CFD) methods were used to validate these concepts. As a result, it was shown that both concepts can effectively mitigate the air-ingress process. In the first concept, the injected helium replaces the air in the core and the lower plenum upper part by buoyancy force because of its low density. It prevented air from moving into the reactor core showing great potential for mitigating graphite oxidation in the core. In the second concept, the air-ingress rate is controlled by molecular diffusion through the opening at the enclosure bottom after depressurization. Some modified reactor cavity design is expected to play this role in the VHTRs.","","","Idaho National Lab.

"Crack model for toughness of green parts with moisture or a fluid binder","Cannon, W Roger; Lessing, Paul A; Zuck, Larry D","11 NUCLEAR FUEL CYCLE AND FUEL MATERIALS; Ceramic; Crack Model; Green Strength; Moisture; Nuclear Fuel","A model is presented to predict the toughness, KIC, of green ceramics based on the binding forces of meniscuses formed between particles near the tip of the critical flaw. The model considers capillary pressure, surface tension and the viscous flow of binder. Calculations were determined for moisture only but the model can also be applied to binder meniscuses. Capillary pressure is highest at low moisture content. By using well established force distance relationships for the meniscus between single particles, toughness was determined as a function of moisture content. For non-agglomerated particles, KIC increases with moisture content and decreases with contact angle and no particle size dependence was found. On the other hand, if particles are agglomerated and the meniscus is between agglomerates, the toughness is particles size dependent and the toughness reaches a maximum at low moisture content. This model assumes that the capillary pressure is transmitted throughout the green part. The calculated values of KIC agree approximately with the measured toughness values of binderless green parts having two different specific surface areas.","","","Idaho National Lab.

On that day we must be particularly certain that all special nuclear materials (SNM) are adequately accounted for and protected and that we have a clear understanding of the utility of nuclear materials to potential adversaries. To this end, this paper examines the attractiveness of materials mixtures containing SNM and alternate nuclear materials associated with the plutonium-uranium reduction extraction (Purex), uranium extraction (UREX), coextraction (COEX), thorium extraction (THOREX), and PYROX (an electrochemical refining method) reprocessing schemes. This paper provides a set of figures of merit for evaluating material attractiveness that covers a broad range of proliferant state and subnational group capabilities. The primary conclusion of this paper is that all fissile material must be rigorously safeguarded to detect diversion by a state and must be provided the highest levels of physical protection to prevent theft by subnational groups; no 'silver bullet' fuel cycle has been found that will permit the relaxation of current international safeguards or national physical security protection levels. The work reported herein has been performed at the request of the U.S. Department of Energy (DOE) and is based on the calculation of 'attractiveness levels' that are expressed in terms consistent with, but normally reserved for, the nuclear materials in DOE nuclear facilities.

Here, we use three-dimensional (3D) surface time-lapse electrical imaging to monitor subsurface electrical conductivity variations associated with stage-driven groundwater/surface-water interaction along a stretch of the Columbia River adjacent to the Hanford 300 Area, Hanford WA, USA. We reduce the resulting 3D conductivity time series using both correlation and time-frequency analysis to isolate a paleochannel causing enhanced groundwater/river-water interaction. Correlation analysis on the time-lapse imaging results concisely represents enhanced ground water/surface-water interaction within the paleochannel, and provides information concerning groundwater flow velocities. Time-frequency analysis using the Stockwell (S) Transform provides additional information by 1) identifying the stage periodicities driving ground water/river-water interaction due to upstream dam operations, 2) identifying segments in time-frequency space when these interactions are most active. These results provide new insight into the distribution and timing of river water intrusion into the Hanford 300 area, which has a governing influence on the behavior of a uranium plume left over from historical nuclear fuel processing operations.","","","Pacific Northwest National Lab.

To characterize the synergistic mechanisms, we determine the free energy of mixed co-assembly in aggregates. Aggregation in any point of a phase diagram can be followed not only structurally by SANS, SAXS, and SLS, but also thermodynamically by determining the concentration of monomers coexisting with reverse aggregates. Using the industrially used couple HDEHP/TOPO forming mixed reverse aggregates, and the representative couple U/Fe, we show that there is no peculiarity in the aggregates microstructure at the maximum of synergism. Nevertheless, the free energy of aggregation necessary to form mixed aggregates containing extracted ions in their polar core is comparable to the transfer free energy difference between target and nontarget ions, as deduced from the synergistic selectivity peak.

TLS is of great interest in this context since it combines the advantages of optical detection methods with an inherent suitability for small-scale samples. After validating the experimental principle in a classical thermal lens crossed-beam setup, we show the integration of a Young-interferometer with a microcapillary on a glass substrate, reducing the necessary sample size to 400 nl. The interferometer translates the photo-thermally induced refractive index change in the fluid to a phase shift of the fringe pattern, which can then be detected by a camera. Measurements of Co(II) in ethanol yield a detection limit of c = 5 x 10{sup -4} M for the crossed-beam setup and c = 6 x 10{sup -3} M for the integrated sensor. At an interaction length of 10 m, it detects a minimum absorbance of K = 1.2 x 10{sup -4} in a probed volume of 14 pl.

Hexavalent americium was prepared using room-temperature sodium bismuthate oxidation. Under these conditions the majority of the lanthanides were not oxidized and remained inextractable. A separation factor of approximately 50 was provided for americium from europium over the nitric acid concentration range 6–7 M. Cerium was the exception with oxidation to CeIV resulting in its co-extraction with AmVI. However, since americium is readily reduced to AmIII it was easily stripped with a dilute acidic solution of hydrogen peroxide. Although hydrogen peroxide also reduces cerium, it does so slowly, and a selective americium strip was achieved, with a separation factor of between 15–25. Alternatively, since americium spontaneously reduced in the loaded organic phase, samples allowed to stand for 2 hours could be selectively stripped of americium by contact with 1 M HNO3 containing no additional reagents. The implications for use in fuel cycle separations are discussed.","","","Idaho National Lab.

"Full-length U-xPu-10Zr (x=0, 8, 19 wt%) Fast Reactor Fuel Test in FFTF","Porter, D L; Tsai, H C","11 NUCLEAR FUEL CYCLE AND FUEL MATERIALS; metallic fast reactor fuel; U-Pu-Zr fuel","The Integral Fast Reactor-1 (IFR-1) experiment performed in the Fast Flux Test Facility (FFTF) was the only U-Pu-10Zr (Pu-0, 8 and 19 wt%) metallic fast reactor test with commercial-length (91.4 cm active fuel column length) conducted to date. With few remaining test reactors there is little opportunity for performing another test with a long active fuel column. The assembly was irradiated to the goal burnup of 10 at.%. The beginning of life (BOL) peak cladding temperature of the hottest pin was 608?C, cooling to 522?C at end of life (EOL). Selected fuel pins were examined non destructively using neutron radiography, precision axial gamma scanning, and both laser and spiral contact cladding profilometry. Destructive exams included plenum gas pressure, volume, and gas composition determinations on a number of pins followed by optical metallography, electron probe microanalysis (EPMA), and alpha and beta gamma autoradiography on a single U-19Pu-10Zr pin. The post-irradiation examinations (PIEs) showed very few differences compared to the short-pin (34.3 cm fuel column) testing performed on fuels of similar composition in Experimental Breeder Reactor-II (EBR-II). The fuel column grew axially slightly less than observed in the short pins, but with the same pattern of decreasing growth with increasing Pu content. There was a difference in the fuel-cladding chemical interaction (FCCI) in that the maximum cladding penetration by interdiffusion with fuel/fission products did not occur at the top of the fuel column where the cladding temperature is highest, as observed in EBR-II tests. Instead, the more exaggerated fission-rate profile of the FFTF pins resulted in a peak FCCI at ~0.7 X/L axial location along the fuel column. This resulted from a lower production of rare earth fission products higher in the fuel column as well as a much smaller delta-T between fuel center and cladding, and therefore less FCCI, despite the higher cladding temperature. This behavior could actually help extend the life of a fuel pin in a “long pin” reactor design to a higher peak fuel burnup.","","","Idaho National Lab.

Research projects to determine the fission product transport mechanisms in TRISO coated particles necessitate heat treatment studies as well as the manufacturing of a unique sealed system for experimentation at very high temperatures. This article describes firstly the design and creation of an alumina jig designed to contain 500 {mu}m diameter ZrO2 spheres intended for annealing experiments at temperatures up to 1600 C. Functional requirements of this jig are the precision positioning of spheres for laser ablation, welding and post weld heat treatment in order to ensure process repeatability and accurate indexing of individual spheres. The design challenges and the performance of the holding device are reported. Secondly the manufacture of a sealing system using laser micromachining is reported. ZrO2 micro plugs isolate the openings of micro-machined cavities to produce a gas-tight seal fit for application in a high temperature environment. The technique is described along with a discussion of the problems experienced during the sealing process. Typical problems experienced were seating dimensions and the relative small size ({approx} 200 {mu}m) of these plugs that posed handling challenges. Manufacturing processes for both the tapered seating cavity and the plug are demonstrated. In conclusion, this article demonstrates the application of Nd-YAG micromachining in an innovative way to solve practical research problems.","","","Idaho National Lab.

Fractionation of these isotopes is due to the 135 decay chain requiring several days to completely decay to Cs and the 137 decay chain less than one hour. Since the Cs precursors are gases, iodine and xenon, the 135Cs plume was deposited farther downwind than the 137Cs plume. Samples were obtained from the Las Vegas arm of Lake Mead, separated into segments, gamma counted to identify layers of activity and analyzed for 135Cs/137Cs ratios. The layers proved to have nearly identical highly fractionated isotope ratios. This information is consistent with a model where the cesium was initially deposited onto the land area draining into Lake Mead and the composite from all the above ground shots subsequently washed onto the Lake by high intensity rain and windstorms producing a layering of Cs activity where each layer is a portion of the composite.","","","Idaho National Lab.

"Natural Circulation Patterns in the VHTR Air-Ingress Accident and Related Issues","Oh, Chang H; Kim, Eung S","11 NUCLEAR FUEL CYCLE AND FUEL MATERIALS; Air Ingress; CFD; Natural Circulation Recireculation; Very High Temperature Reactor; VHTR","Natural circulation patterns in the VHTR during a hypothetical air-ingress accident have been investigated using computational fluid dynamic (CFD) methods in order to compare results from the previous 1-D model which was developed using GAMMA code for the air-ingress analyses. The GT-MHR 600 MWt reactor was selected to be the reference design and modeled by a half symmetric 3-D geometry using FLUENT 6.3, a commercial CFD code. CFD simulations were carried out as the steady-state calculation, and the boundary conditions were either assumed or provided from the 1-D GAMMA code results. Totally, 12 different cases have been reviewed, and many notable results have been obtained through in this work. According to the simulations, natural circulation patterns in the reactor were quite different from the previous 1-D assumptions. A large re-circulation flow with thermal stratification phenomena was clearly observed in the hot-leg and the lower plenum in the 3-D model. This re-circulation flow provided about an order faster air-ingress speed (0.46 m/s in superficial velocity) than previously predicted by 1-D modeling (0.02~0.03 m/s). It indicates that the 1-D air-ingress modeling may significantly distort the air-ingress scenario and consequences. In addition, complicated natural circulation patterns are eventually expected to result in very complex graphite oxidations and corrosion behaviors.","","","Idaho National Lab.

Several research activities showed some recycled spent fuel can be used as additional fuel loading for increasing fuel breeding capability as well as improving intrinsic aspect of nuclear non-proliferation. The present investigation intends to evaluate the composition of heavy metals inventories and fuel breeding capability in the FBR design based on the loaded fuel of light water reactor (LWR) spent fuel (SF) of 33 GWd/t with 5 years cooling time by adopting depletion code of ORIGEN. Whole core analysis of FBR design is performed by adopting and coupling codes such as SLAROM code, JOINT and CITATION codes. Nuclear data library, JFS-3-J-3.2R which is based on the JENDL 3.2 has been used for nuclear data analysis. JSFR design is the basis design reference which basically adopted 800 days cycle length for 4 batches system. Higher inventories of plutonium of MOX fuel and TRU fuel types at equilibrium composition than initial composition have been shown. Minor actinide (MA) inventory compositions obtain a different inventory trends at equilibrium composition for both fuel types. Higher Inventory of MA is obtained by MOX fuel and less MA inventory for TRU fuel at equilibrium composition than initial composition. Some different MA inventories can be estimated from the different inventory trend of americium (Am). Higher americium inventory for MOX fuel and less americium inventory for TRU fuel at equilibrium condition. Breeding ratio of TRU fuel is relatively higher compared with MOX fuel type. It can be estimated from relatively higher production of Pu-238 (through converted MA) in TRU fuel, and Pu-238 converts through neutron capture to produce Pu-239. Higher breeding ratio of MOX fuel and TRU fuel types at equilibrium condition are estimated from converted fertile material during reactor operation into fissile material of plutonium such as converted uranium fuel (converted U-238 into Pu-239) or additional converted fuel from MA into Pu-238 and changes into Pu-239 by capturing neutron. Loading LWR SF gives better fuel breeding capability and increase inventory of MA for doping material of MOX fuel; however, it requires more supply MA inventory for TRU fuel type.","","","","","","United States","2012-06-06T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","Conference","Journal Name: AIP Conference Proceedings; Journal Volume: 1448; Journal Issue: 1; Conference: ICANSE 2011: 3. international conference on advances in nuclear science and engineering, Bali (Indonesia), 14-17 Nov 2011; Other Information: (c) 2012 American Institute of Physics; Country of input: International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA)","","Medium: X; Size: page(s) 119-125","","","","Journal ID: ISSN 0094-243X; CODEN: APCPCS; TRN: US12A8561094265","10.1063/1.4725446","","2013-03-14T00:00:00Z","22004160","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/22004160","","AIP Conference Proceedings","1","1448"

Capabilities of the FEMAXI-V code to predict the thermal and fission gas release have been tested on MOX fuels in LWRs which has been done in SCK{center_dot}CEN and Belgonucleaire by using PRIMO MOX rod BD8 irradiation experiment after V Sobolev as reported O. J. Ott. Base irradiation in the BR3 reactor, the BD8 rod was transported to CEA-Saclay for irradiation in the OSIRIS reactor (ramp power excursion). The irradiation device used for the PRIMO ramps was the ISABELLE 1 loop, installed on a movable structure of the core periphery.

In addition, analysis on nuclear forensics which is related to spent fuel compositions becomes one of the interesting topics to evaluate the origin and the composition of spent fuels from the spent fuel foot-prints. Spent fuel compositions of different fuel types give some typical spent fuel foot prints and can be estimated the origin of source of those spent fuel compositions. Some technics or methods have been developing based on some science and technological capability including experimental and modeling or theoretical aspects of analyses. Some foot-print of nuclear forensics will identify the typical information of spent fuel compositions such as enrichment information, burnup or irradiation time, reactor types as well as the cooling time which is related to the age of spent fuels. This paper intends to evaluate the typical spent fuel compositions of light water (LWR) and fast breeder reactors (FBR) from the view point of some foot prints of nuclear forensics. An established depletion code of ORIGEN is adopted to analyze LWR spent fuel (SF) for several burnup constants and decay times. For analyzing some spent fuel compositions of FBR, some coupling codes such as SLAROM code, JOINT and CITATION codes including JFS-3-J-3.2R as nuclear data library have been adopted. Enriched U-235 fuel composition of oxide type is used for fresh fuel of LWR and a mixed oxide fuel (MOX) for FBR fresh fuel. Those MOX fuels of FBR come from the spent fuels of LWR. Some typical spent fuels from both LWR and FBR will be compared to distinguish some typical foot-prints of SF based on nuclear forensic analysis.","","","","","","United States","2012-06-06T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","Conference","Journal Name: AIP Conference Proceedings; Journal Volume: 1448; Journal Issue: 1; Conference: ICANSE 2011: 3. international conference on advances in nuclear science and engineering, Bali (Indonesia), 14-17 Nov 2011; Other Information: (c) 2012 American Institute of Physics; Country of input: International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA)","","Medium: X; Size: page(s) 142-152","","","","Journal ID: ISSN 0094-243X; CODEN: APCPCS; TRN: US12A8564094268","10.1063/1.4725449","","2013-03-14T00:00:00Z","22004163","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/22004163","","AIP Conference Proceedings","1","1448"

As the design concept should be compatible with current operating PWR plants, however, it shows a narrow gap between the fuel rods when compared with current solid nuclear fuel arrays and needs to modify the spacer grid shapes and their positions. In this study, fretting wear tests have been performed to evaluate the wear resistance of a dual-cooled fuel by using a proposed spring and dimple of spacer grids that have a cantilever type and hemispherical shape, respectively. As a result, the wear volume of the spring specimen gradually increases as the contact condition is changed from a certain gap, just contact to positive force. However, in the dimple specimen, just contact condition shows a large wear volume. In addition, a circular rod motion at upper region of contact surface is gradually increased and its diametric size depends on the wear depth increase. Based on the test results, the fretting wear resistance of the proposed spring and dimple is analyzed by comparing the wear measurement results and rod motion in detail.","","","","","","United States","2012-06-06T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","Conference","Journal Name: AIP Conference Proceedings; Journal Volume: 1448; Journal Issue: 1; Conference: ICANSE 2011: 3. international conference on advances in nuclear science and engineering, Bali (Indonesia), 14-17 Nov 2011; Other Information: (c) 2012 American Institute of Physics; Country of input: International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA)","","Medium: X; Size: page(s) 235-241","","","","Journal ID: ISSN 0094-243X; CODEN: APCPCS; TRN: US12A8569094273","10.1063/1.4725460","","2013-03-14T00:00:00Z","22004168","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/22004168","","AIP Conference Proceedings","1","1448"

Later on in the core, the reactor gradually converts the non-fissile material into the fissile in a process like a traveling wave. In this work, a TWR with spent nuclear fuel blanket was studied.

To increase reactor operation time and reduce excess-reactivity below 1% dk/k, Protactinium (Pa-231) is used as Burnable Poison. Protactinium-231 has very interesting neutronic properties, which enable the core to reduce initial excess-reactivity and simultaneously increase production of {sup 233}U to {sup 231}Pa in burn-up process. Optimizations of the content of {sup 231}Pa in the core enables the BWR core to sustain long period of operation time with reasonable burn-up reactivity swing.

The results suggest that fluid axial heat conduction in a natural circulation loop should be considered only when the modified Peclet number is {approx}1 or less, which is significantly smaller than the practical value of a lead liquid metal-cooled reactor.","","","Idaho National Lab.

Many metallic nuclear fuels are body-centered cubic alloys of uranium that swell under fission conditions, creating fission product gases such as helium, xenon and krypton. In this paper, helium, xenon, and krypton point defects are investigated in the a and ? phases of metallic uranium using first principles calculations. A density functional theory (DFT) framework is utilized with projector augmented-wave (PAW) pseudopotentials. Formation and incorporation energies of He, Xe, and Kr are calculated at various defect positions for the prediction of fission gas behavior in uranium. In most cases, defect energies follow a size effect, with helium incorporation and formation energies being the smallest. The most likely position for the larger Xe and Kr atoms in uranium is the substitutional site. Helium atoms are likely to be found in a wide variety of defect positions due to the comparable formation energies of all defect configurations analyzed. This is the first detailed study of the stability and incorporation of fission gases in uranium.","","","Idaho National Lab.

As part of this development, fuel plates have been irradiated in the Advanced Test Reactor and then characterized using optical metallography (OM) and scanning electron microscopy (SEM) to determine the as-irradiated microstructure. To demonstrate the irradiation performance of U-7Mo dispersion fuel plates with 2 wt% Si added to the matrix, fuel plates were tested to medium burnups at intermediate fission rates as part of the RERTR-6 experiment. Further testing was performed to higher fission rates as part of the RERTR-7A experiment, and very aggressive testing (high temperature, high fission density, high fission rate) was performed in the RERTR-9A, RERTR-9B and AFIP-1 experiments. As-irradiated microstructures were compared to those observed after fabrication to determine the effects of irradiation on the microstructure. Based on comparison of the microstructural characterization results for each irradiated sample, some general conclusions can be drawn about how the microstructure evolves during irradiation: there is growth of the fuel/matrix interaction layer (FMI), which was present in the samples to some degree after fabrication, during irradiation; Si diffuses from the FMI layer to deeper depths in the U-7Mo particles as the irradiation conditions are made more aggressive; lowering of the Si content in the FMI layer results in an increase in the size of the fission gas bubbles; as the FMI layer grows during irradiation more Si diffuses from the matrix to the FMI layer/matrix interface, and interlinking of fission gas bubbles in the fuel plate microstructure that may indicate breakaway swelling is not observed.","","","Idaho National Lab.

Nitrogen trifluoride is less chemically and reactively hazardous than the hazardous and aggressive fluorinating agents used to prepare uranium hexafluoride and considered for fluoride volatility based nuclear fuels reprocessing. In addition, nitrogen trifluoride’s less aggressive character may be used to separate the volatile fluorides from used fuel and from themselves based on the fluorination reaction’s temperature sensitivity (thermal tunability) rather than relying on differences in sublimation/boiling temperature and sorbents. Our thermodynamic calculations found that nitrogen trifluoride has the potential to produce volatile fission product and actinide fluorides from candidate oxides and metals. Our simultaneous thermogravimetric and differential thermal analyses found that the oxides of lanthanum, cerium, rhodium, and plutonium fluorinated but did not form volatile fluorides and that depending on temperature volatile fluorides formed from the oxides of niobium, molybdenum, ruthenium, tellurium, uranium, and neptunium. We also demonstrated near-quantitative removal of uranium from plutonium in a mixed oxide.","","","Pacific Northwest National Lab.

"TEM Characterization of U-7Mo/Al-2Si Dispersion Fuel Irradiated to Intermediate and High Fission Densities","Gan, J; Keiser, Jr, D D; Miller, B D; Robinson, A B; Jue, J-F; Medvedev, P G; Wachs, D M","11 NUCLEAR FUEL CYCLE AND FUEL MATERIALS; BUBBLES; DISTRIBUTION; FABRICATION; FISSION; FUEL PARTICLES; FUEL PLATES; GASES; IRRADIATION; SUPERLATTICES; SWELLING; fuel particle analysis; transmission electron microscopy; U-7Mo/Al-2Si","This paper will discuss the results of TEM analysis that was performed on two samples taken from the low flux and high flux sides of the fuel plate with U-7Mo fuel particles dispersed in U-2Si matrix. The corresponding local fission density of the fuel particles and the peak fuel plate centerline temperature between the low flux and high flux samples are 3.32 x 10{sup 27} f/m{sup 3} and 90 C, and 6.31 x 10{sup 27} f/m{sup 3} and 120 C, respectively. The results of this work showed the presence of a bubble superlattice within the U-7Mo grains that accommodated fission gases (e.g., Xe). The presence of this structure helps the U-7Mo exhibit a stable swelling behavior during irradiation. The Si-rich interaction layers that develop around the fuel particles at the U-7Mo/matrix interface during fuel plate fabrication and irradiation become amorphous during irradiation. The change in bubble distribution at the high fission density suggests that the bubble superlattice is stable as the U-7Mo matrix remains crystalline. It appears that there is a threshold Si content in the fuel particle above which the U-Mo turns to amorphous under irradiation. The threshold Si content is approximately 8 at.% and 4 at.% for low flux and high flux condition, respectively.","","","Idaho National Lab.

The addition of Dy2O3 (forming a solid solution) resulted in an increase in relative density and a decrease in grain size. The relative density of samples with Dy2O3 content of 6 and 10 mol% was over 95% when sintered at 1050 C under 500 MPa for holding times as short as 5 minutes. The application of high pressure facilitated the consolidation to relatively high densities with minimal grain growth. Heating rate and holding time, however, had insignificant effect on density but a measurable effect on grain size.","","","Idaho National Lab.

A HEX-Z partially-homogenized benchmark model of the FFTF fully-loaded core configuration was developed for evaluation of these measurements. Evaluated measurements include the critical eigenvalue of the fully-loaded core, two neutron spectra, 32 reactivity effects measurements, an isothermal temperature coefficient, and low-energy gamma and electron spectra. Dominant uncertainties in the critical configuration include the placement of radial shielding around the core, reactor core assembly pitch, composition of the stainless steel components, plutonium content in the fuel pellets, and boron content in the absorber pellets. Calculations of criticality, reactivity effects measurements, and the isothermal temperature coefficient using MCNP5 and ENDF/B-VII.0 cross sections with the benchmark model are in good agreement with the benchmark experiment measurements. There is only some correlation between calculated and measured spectral measurements; homogenization of many of the core components may have impacted computational assessment of these measurements.

In this work, solid-to-solid diffusion couples were assembled between pure U and Fe, and annealed at 853K, 888K and 923K where U exists as orthorhombic {alpha}, and at 953K and 973K where U exists as tetragonal {beta}. The microstructures and concentration profiles developed during annealing were examined by scanning electron microscopy and electron probe microanalysis, respectively. U{sub 6}Fe and UFe{sub 2} intermetallics developed in all diffusion couples, and U{sub 6}Fe was observed to grow faster than UFe{sub 2}. The interdiffusion fluxes of U and Fe were calculated to determine the integrated interdiffusion coefficients in U{sub 6}Fe and UFe{sub 2}. The extrinsic (K{sub I}) and intrinsic growth constants (K{sub II}) of U{sub 6}Fe and UFe{sub 2} were also calculated according to Wagner's formalism. The difference between K{sub I} and K{sub II} of UFe{sub 2} indicate that its growth was impeded by the fast-growing U{sub 6}Fe phase. However, the thin UFe{sub 2} played only a small role on the growth of U{sub 6}Fe as its K{sub I} and K{sub II} values were determined to be similar. The allotropic transformation of uranium (orthorhombic {alpha} to tetragonal {beta} phase) was observed to influence the growth of U{sub 6}Fe directly, because the growth rate of U{sub 6}Fe changed based on variation of activation energy. The change in chemical potential and crystal structure of U due to the allotropic transformation affected the interdiffusion between U and U{sub 6}Fe. Faster growth of U{sub 6}Fe is also examined with respect to various factors including crystal structure, phase diagram, and diffusion.","","","Idaho National Lab.

Ideally, the envisioned technologies would be capable of non-destructive, near-real-time (NRT), autonomous process monitoring. This paper describes results from proof-of-principle experiments designed to test the Multi-Isotope Process (MIP) Monitor, a novel approach to safeguarding reprocessing facilities. The MIP Monitor combines the detection of intrinsic gamma ray signatures emitted from process solutions with multivariate analysis to detect off-normal conditions in process streams nondestructively and in NRT. Commercial spent nuclear fuel of various irradiation histories was dissolved and separated using a PUREX-based batch solvent extraction. Extractions were performed at various nitric acid concentrations to mimic both normal and off-normal industrial plant operating conditions. Principal Component Analysis (PCA) was applied to the simulated gamma spectra to investigate pattern variations as a function of acid concentration, burnup and cooling time. Partial Least Squares (PLS) regression was applied to attempt to quantify both the acid concentration and burnup of the dissolved spent fuel during the initial separation stage of recycle. The MIP Monitor demonstrated sensitivity to induced variations of acid concentration, including the distinction of {+-} 1.3 M variation from normal process conditions by way of PCA. Acid concentration was predicted using measurements from the organic extract and PLS resulting in predictions with &lt;0.7 M relative error. Quantification of burnup levels from dissolved fuel spectra using PLS was demonstrated to be within 2.5% of previously measured values.","","","Pacific Northwest National Lab.

Currently, borosilicate glass is the waste form selected for immobilization of this waste stream, however, the low thermal stability and solubility of MoO{sub 3} in borosilicate glass translates into a maximum waste loading in the range of 15-20 mass%. Glass-ceramics provide the opportunity to target durable crystalline phases, e.g., powellite, oxyapatite, celsian, and pollucite, that will incorporate MoO{sub 3} as well as other waste components such as lanthanides, alkalis, and alkaline earths at levels 2X the solubility limits of a single-phase glass. In addition a glass-ceramic could provide higher thermal stability, depending upon the properties of the crystalline and amorphous phases. Glass-ceramics were successfully synthesized at waste loadings of 42, 45, and 50 mass% with the following glass additives: B{sub 2}O{sub 3}, Al{sub 2}O{sub 3}, CaO and SiO{sub 2} by slow cooling form from a glass melt. Glass-ceramics were characterized in terms of phase assemblage, morphology, and thermal stability. The targeted phases: powellite and oxyapatite were observed in all of the compositions along with a lanthanide borosilicate, and cerianite. Results of this initial investigation of glass-ceramics show promise as a potential waste form to replace single-phase borosilicate glass.","","","Pacific Northwest National Lab.

Many current modeling tools are strictly 2D axisymmetric or even 1.5D. This paper outlines the capabilities of a new fuel modeling tool able to analyze either 2D axisymmetric or fully 3D models. These capabilities include temperature-dependent thermal conductivity of fuel; swelling and densification; fuel creep; pellet fracture; fission gas release; cladding creep; irradiation growth; and gap mechanics (contact and gap heat transfer). The need for multiphysics, multidimensional modeling is then demonstrated through a discussion of results for a set of example problems. The first, a 10-pellet rodlet, demonstrates the viability of the solution method employed. This example highlights the effect of our smeared cracking model and also shows the multidimensional nature of discrete fuel pellet modeling. The second example relies on our multidimensional, multiphysics approach to analyze a missing pellet surface problem. The next example is the analysis of cesium diffusion in a TRISO fuel particle with defects. As a final example, we show a lower-length-scale simulation coupled to a continuum-scale simulation.","","","Idaho National Lab.

Pore migration is observed towards the high temperature domain with velocities that agree with analytical solution. Due to the low thermal conductivity of the pores, the temperature gradient across individual pores is increased, which in turn, accelerates the pore migration. In particular, for pores filled with xenon and helium, the pore velocities are increased by a factor of 2.2 and 2.1, respectively.

This approach exploits the unique isotope-specific signatures contained in the delayed gamma-ray emission spectra detected following active interrogation with an external neutron source. A high fidelity modeling approach that couples radiation transport, analytical decay/depletion, and a newly developed gamma-ray emission source reconstruction code is described. Initially simulated and analyzed was a “one-pass” delayed gamma-ray assay that focused on the long-lived signatures. Also presented are the results of an independent study that investigated “pulsed mode” measurements to capture the more isotope-specific, short-lived signatures. The initial modeling results outlined in this paper suggest that delayed gamma-ray assay of spent nuclear fuel assemblies can be accomplished with a neutron generator of sufficient strength and currently available gamma-ray detectors.","Institute of Nuclear Materials Management","External Audience (Unlimited)","Lawrence Livermore National Lab.

LCA literature indicates that life cycle GHG emissions from nuclear power are a fraction of traditional fossil sources, but the conditions and assumptions under which nuclear power are deployed can have a significant impact on the magnitude of life cycle GHG emissions relative to renewable technologies. Screening 274 references yielded 27 that reported 99 independent estimates of life cycle GHG emissions from light water reactors (LWRs). The published median, interquartile range (IQR), and range for the pool of LWR life cycle GHG emission estimates were 13, 23, and 220 grams of carbon dioxide equivalent per kilowatt-hour (g CO{sub 2}-eq/kWh), respectively. After harmonizing methods to use consistent gross system boundaries and values for several important system parameters, the same statistics were 12, 17, and 110 g CO{sub 2}-eq/kWh, respectively. Harmonization (especially of performance characteristics) clarifies the estimation of central tendency and variability. To explain the remaining variability, several additional, highly influential consequential factors were examined using other methods. These factors included the primary source energy mix, uranium ore grade, and the selected LCA method.

"Dissolution of cerium(IV)-lanthanide(III) oxides: Comparative effect of chemical composition, temperature, and acidity","Horlait, D.; Clavier, N.; Szenknect, S.; Dacheux, N.; Dubois, V.","11 NUCLEAR FUEL CYCLE AND FUEL MATERIALS; ACTIVATION ENERGY; CERIUM OXIDES; CHEMICAL COMPOSITION; CHEMICAL REACTION KINETICS; GRAIN BOUNDARIES; LEACHING; NITRIC ACID; PH VALUE; PHOSPHATES; SINTERING; SOLID SOLUTIONS; TEMPERATURE DEPENDENCE; X-RAY DIFFRACTION","The dissolution of Ce{sub 1-x}Ln{sub x}O{sub 2-x/2} solid solutions was undertaken in various acid media in order to evaluate the effects of several physicochemical parameters such as chemical composition, temperature, and acidity on the reaction kinetics. The normalized dissolution rates (R{sub L,0}) were found to be strongly modified by the trivalent lanthanide incorporation rate, due to the presence of oxygen vacancies decreasing the samples cohesion. Conversely, the nature of the trivalent cation considered only weakly impacted the R{sub L,0} values. The dependence of the normalized dissolution rates on the temperature then appeared to be of the same order of magnitude than that of chemical composition. Moreover, it allowed determining the corresponding activation energy (E{sub A} ≅ 60-85 kJ.mol{sup -1}) which accounts for a dissolution driven by surface-controlled reactions. A similar conclusion was made regarding the acidity of the solution: the partial order related to (H{sub 3}O{sup +}) reaching about 0.7. Finally, the prevailing effect of the incorporation of aliovalent cations in the fluorite-type CeO{sub 2} matrix on the dissolution kinetics precluded the observation of slight effects such as those linked to the complexing agents or to the crystal structure of the samples.

One consists of randomly oriented crystallites and exhibits isotropic elastic behavior (two elastic constants) and the other is highly textured by rolling and exhibits anisotropic elastic behavior (three elastic constants). The elastic constants are measured using electron backscatter diffraction, LRUS, and time domain laser ultrasound (LU). The elastic constants for the isotropic sample obtained using EBSD, LU and LRUS agree closely. However, for the anisotropic sample, there is considerable disagreement between results obtained using LRUS and results obtained using LU and EBSD. Analysis revels that increasing the dimensionality of the modulus space leads to questions of whether the solution is unique to within experimental error. The consequence is that small uncertainties in the assumed symmetry of the elastic stiffness tensor for anisotropic materials can lead to large uncertainties in the calculated elastic constants.","","","Idaho National Lab.

The magnesium oxide phase remains pure MgO, while the zirconia incorporates a small amount of magnesium oxide along with all of the plutonium oxide and erbium oxide. The performance of the material under reactor and repository environments was examined. Reactor conditions are examined using a pressure vessel to expose the material to 300 degrees C water. To assess the performance of the material as a waste form it was submerged in 90 degrees C water for 1000 h. In both aqueous dissolution studies there was minimal release of less than 0.8 wt.% of plutonium from the material. To examine the potential for recycling, the dissolution behavior of the fuel matrix was examined in acidic solutions: pure nitric acid and a nitric acid-hydrofluoric acid-peroxide solution. Both acidic media exhibit potential for dissolving plutonium from the zirconia matrix. The experiments performed in this study are meant to lay a foundation for the chemical performance of zirconia-magnesia inert matrix fuel containing fissile material and burnable poison.","","","Idaho National Lab.

"Nuclear Fuels: Promise and Limitations","McFarlane, Harold F.","11 NUCLEAR FUEL CYCLE AND FUEL MATERIALS; nuclear fuel cycle","From 1950 through 1980, scientists, engineers and national leaders confidently predicted an early twenty-first century where fast breeder reactors and commercial nuclear fuel reprocessing were commonplace. Such a scenario seemed necessary for a world with the more than 1000 GWe of nuclear energy needed to meet such an ever-increasing thirst for energy. Thirty years later uranium reserves are increasing on pace with consumption, the growth of nuclear power has been slowed, commercial breeder reactors have yet to enter the marketplace, and less than a handful of commercial reprocessing plants operate. As Nobel Laureate Niels Bohr famously said, “Prediction is very difficult, especially if it’s about the future.” The programme for IChemE’s 2012 conference on the nuclear fuel cycle features a graphic of an idealized nuclear fuel cycle that symbolizes the quest for a closed nuclear fuel cycle featuring careful husbanding of precious resources while minimizing the waste footprint. Progress toward achieving this ideal has been disrupted by technology innovations in the mining and petrochemical industries, as well as within the nuclear industry.","","","Idaho National Lab.

Because of the composite nature of the sample as well as the need to measure samples pre- and postirradiation, measurement must be performed on the whole compact non-destructively. No existing measurement system is capable of obtaining its thermal conductivity in a non-destructive manner. The designed apparatus is an adaptation of the guardedcomparative-longitudinal heat flow technique. The system uniquely demonstrates the use of a radiative heat sink to provide cooling which greatly simplifies the design and setup of such high-temperature systems. The design was aimed to measure thermalconductivity values covering the expected range of effective thermal conductivity of the composite nuclear fuel from 10W {center_dot} m{sup -1} {center_dot} K{sup -1} to 70W {center_dot} m{sup -1} {center_dot} K{sup -1}. Several materials having thermal conductivities covering this expected range have been measured for system validation, and results are presented. A comparison of the results has been made to data from existing literature.Additionally, an uncertainty analysis is presented finding an overall uncertainty in sample thermal conductivity to be 6%, matching well with the results of the validation samples.","","","Idaho National Lab.

The percolation of gas bubbles on grain boundaries, and the subsequent percolation of grain boundary networks is the primary mechanism of fission gas release from nuclear fuels. Both radial cracks and radial gradients in grain boundary property distributions are correlated with the fraction of grain boundaries vented to the free surfaces. Our results show that cracks surprisingly do not significantly increase the percolation of uniform grain boundary networks. However, for networks with radial gradients in boundary properties, the cracks can considerably raise the vented grain boundary content.","","","Idaho National Lab.

Nuclear transmutations caused by neutron activation occur in the beryllium reflector regions, which leads to unwanted neutron absorbing and radiation emitting isotopes. During the past year, two topics related to the HFIR beryllium reflector were reviewed. The first topic included studying the neutron poison (helium-3 and lithium-6) buildup in the reflector regions and its affect on beginning-of-cycle reactivity. A new methodology was developed to predict the reactivity impact and estimated symmetrical critical control element positions as a function of outage time between cycles due to helium-3 buildup and was shown to be in better agreement with actual symmetrical critical control element position data than the current methodology. The second topic included studying the composition of the beryllium reflector regions at discharge as well as during decay to assess the viability of transporting, storing, and ultimately disposing the reflector regions currently stored in the spent fuel pool. The post-irradiation curie inventories were used to determine whether the reflector regions are discharged as transuranic waste or become transuranic waste during the decay period for disposal purposes and to determine the nuclear hazard category, which may affect the controls invoked for transportation and temporary storage. Two of the reflector regions were determined to be transuranic waste at discharge and the other region was determined to become transuranic waste in less than 2 years after being discharged due to the initial uranium content (0.0044 weight percent uranium). It was also concluded that all three of the reflector regions could be classified as nuclear hazard category 3 (potential for localized consequences only).","","","Oak Ridge National Lab.

This application places such agents in contact with the decaying radionuclides, causing radiolysis of the agent in the organic diluent. Recent research seeks to replace common molecular diluents (such as n-dodecane) with hydrophobic room-temperature ionic liquids (ILs), which have superior solvation properties. In alkane diluents, rapid radiolytic deterioration of diglycolamide agents can be inhibited by addition of an aromatic cosolvent that scavenges highly reactive alkane radical cations before these oxidize the extracting agent. Do aromatic ILs exhibit a similar radioprotective effect? To answer this question, we used electron paramagnetic resonance spectroscopy to study the fragmentation pathways in radiolysis of neat diglycolamides, their model compounds, and their solutions in the ILs. Our study indicates that aromatic ILs do not protect these types of solutes from extensive radiolytic damage. Previous research indicated a similar lack of protection for crown ethers, whereas the ILs readily protected di- and trialkyl phosphates (another large class of metal-extracting agents). Our analysis of these unanticipated failures suggests that new types of organic anions are required in order to formulate ILs capable of radioprotection for these classes of solutes. This study is a cautionary tale of the fallacy of analogical thinking when applied to an entirely new and insufficiently understood class of chemical materials.","","","Oak Ridge National Lab.

As a twin approaches a grain boundary, local stress concentration develops due to the incompatible plastic deformations in the two neighboring grains. The magnitude of the stress concentration increases as the twin widens, leading to grain boundary cracking by nucleation and coalescence of microcracks/voids.","","","Idaho National Lab.

The results of prior field characterization studies indicate that the nitrate plume is undergoing a slow rate of attenuation via denitrification, and the results of bench-scale studies suggest that denitrification rates can potentially be increased by an order of magnitude with the addition of ethanol as a carbon substrate. The objective of the study was to investigate the potential of ethanol amendment for enhancing the natural denitrification occurring in the alluvial aquifer. Pilot tests were conducted using the single well, push-pull method and a natural-gradient test. The results showed that the concentration of nitrate decreased, while the concentration of nitrous oxide (a product of denitrification) increased. In addition, changes in aqueous concentrations of sulfate, iron, and manganese indicate the ethanol amendment effected a change in prevailing redox conditions. The results of compound-specific stable isotope analysis for nitrogen indicated that the nitrate concentration reductions were biologically mediated. Continued monitoring after completion of the pilot tests has shown that nitrate concentrations in the injection zone have remained at levels three orders of magnitude lower than the initial values, indicating that the impacts of the pilot tests have been sustained for several months.","","","Pacific Northwest National Lab.

Different ions and energies are used to study the effects of dose, temperature, atomic displacement rate and ionization rate on irradiation-induced amorphization and recrystallization. The dose for amorphization increases with temperature in two stages, below and above 150 K. In the high temperature stage relevant to actinide immobilization, the increase of amorphization dose with temperature exhibits a strong dependence on the ratio of ionization rate to displacement rate for the different ions. Data analysis using a dynamic model for amorphization reveals that ionization-induced processes, with activation energy of 0.15 0.02 eV, dominate dynamic recovery for ions from Ne through Xe. For heavier Au ions or for alpha-recoil nuclei emitted in alpha decay of actinides, ionization becomes less dominant and dynamic recovery is controlled primarily by thermally-driven processes. In post-irradiation annealing studies of amorphous samples, epitaxial thermal recrystallization is observed at 1123 K, and irradiation-enhanced nucleation of nanocrystallites is observed under irradiation with heavier ions. The recrystallization temperature under irradiation decreases with increasing ion mass to a value of ~ 823 K, which also defines the thermally-driven critical temperature for amorphization under irradiation with heavy ions. Some partial recovery due to alpha particle irradiation at 300 K is observed that suggests a self-healing mechanism in apatite phases containing actinides. Based on the results and dynamic model, the temperature and time dependences of amorphization in silicate-apatite host phases for actinide immobilization are predicted.","","","Oak Ridge National Lab.

To obtain adequate fissile loading the kernel of the TRISO particle will need to be UN. In support of the fuel development effort, an assessment of phase regions of interest in the U-C-N system was undertaken as the fuel will be prepared by the carbothermic reduction of the oxide and it will be in equilibrium with carbon within the TRISO particle. The phase equilibria and thermochemistry of the U-C-N system is reviewed, including nitrogen pressure measurements above various phase fields. Selected measurements were used to fit a first order model of the UC1-xNx phase, represented by the inter-solution of UN and UC. Fit to the data was significantly improved by also adjusting the heat of formation for UN by ~12 kJ/mol and the phase equilbria was best reproduced by also adjusting the heat for U2N3 by +XXX. The determined interaction parameters yielded a slightly positive deviation from ideality, which agrees with lattice parameter measurements which show positive deviation from Vegard s law. The resultant model together with reported values for other phases in the system were used to generate isothermal sections of the U-C-N phase diagram. Nitrogen partial pressures were also computed for regions of interest.","","","Oak Ridge National Lab.

First principles calculations are being used to investigate the critical issue of fission product palladium attack on the SiC coating layer. Density functional theory is being used to understand fission product diffusion within the plutonia oxide kernel. Kinetic Monte Carlo techniques are shedding light on transport of fission products, most notably silver, through the carbon and SiC coating layers.

Uranium that currently is mined and milled in one country will be converted, enriched, and fabricated into fuel for reactors in an expanding set of new countries. This expansion will make it harder to guarantee that regional activities stay regional and that diversion detection is timely unless new and sustainable tools are developed to improve inspector effectiveness. To deal with this emerging reality, the IAEA must increase its use of unattended monitoring and employ new tools and methods that enhance CoK during all phases of the fuel cycle. This approach will help provide useful information to aid in detecting undeclared activities and create opportunities for timely and appropriate responses to events well before they enter phases of greater concern (e.g., enrichment). The systems that maintain CoK of safeguarded assets rely on containment and surveillance (C/S) technologies. The 21st century fuel cycle will require increased use of these technologies and systems, plus greater implementation of unattended systems that can securely collect data when inspectors are not present.","","","Oak Ridge National Lab.

Based on review of current world lead or lead-bismuth test facilities and research needs listed in the Generation IV Roadmap, five broad areas of requirements were identified as listed: (1) Develop and Demonstrate Feasibility of Submerged Heat Exchanger; (2) Develop and Demonstrate Open-lattice Flow in Electrically Heated Core; (3) Develop and Demonstrate Chemistry Control; (4) Demonstrate Safe Operation; and (5) Provision for Future Testing. This paper discusses the preliminary design of systems, thermal hydraulic analysis, and simplified cost estimate. The facility thermal hydraulic design is based on the maximum simulated core power using seven electrical heater rods of 420 kW; average linear heat generation rate of 300 W/cm. The core inlet temperature for liquid lead or Pb/Bi eutectic is 4200 C. The design includes approximately seventy-five data measurements such as pressure, temperature, and flow rates.

This series of experiments was part of a larger set of experiments performed to evaluate operational safety margins at the Rocky Flats Plant. The experiments consisted of bare plutonium metal hemishells reflected by steel hemishells of increasing thickness and motor oil. The hemishell assembly was suspended within dual aluminum tanks. Criticality was achieved by pumping oil into the tanks such that effectively infinite reflection was achieved in all directions except directly above the assembly; then the critical oil height was recorded. The results of these experiments had been initially ignored because early computational methods had been inadequate to analyze partially-reflected configurations. The dominant uncertainties include the uncertainty in the average plutonium density and the composition of materials in the gaps between the plutonium hemishells. Simple and detailed benchmark models were developed. Eigenvalue calculations using MCNP5 and ENDF/B-VII.0 were within 2s of the benchmark values.

In order to characterize the mineralogical source of the U and possible structural controls on its presence, a deep (214 m) well was cored adjacent to one of the enriched wells. The highest gamma-ray emissions in the recovered core occur in coarse biotite granite at a depth just below 52 m. A slickenlined fault plane at 48.6 m and narrow pegmatite layers at depths of 113, 203 and 207 m also yield high gamma-ray counts. Thin sections were made from the above materials and along several subvertical healed fractures. Uraninite and coffinite are the principal U-rich minerals in the core. Other U-bearing minerals include thorite and thorogummite, monazite, zircon and allanite. Primary uraninite occurs in the biotite granite and in pegmatite layers. Secondary coffinite is present as tiny (&lt;5 {micro}m) crystals dispersed along fractures in the granite and pegmatites. Coffinite also occurs along the slickenlined fault plane, where it is associated with calcite and calcic zeolite and also replaces allanite. Coffinite lacks radiogenic Pb, hence is considerably younger than the uraninite. Dissolution of partially oxidized Ca-rich uraninite occurring in the surficial biotite granite (or secondary coffinite in fracture zones) is likely the main source for the current high levels of U in nearby area wells. The high-U well waters have a carbonate signature, consistent with pervasive calcite vein mineralization in the core. Aqueous speciation calculations suggest U transport as an uranyl (U{sup 6+}) hydroxyl-carbonate complex. Later reduction resulted in secondary precipitation along fractures as a U{sup 4+} mineral (i.e., coffinite).","","","Brookhaven National Lab.

Here, chalcogels are discussed in the context of nuclear fuel reprocessing and radioactive waste remediation. Motivated by previous work on removal of heavy metals in aqueous solution, we explored the application of germanium sulfide chalcogels as a sorbent for gas-phase I2 based on Pearson's Hard/Soft Acid-Base (HSAB) principle. This work was driven by a significant need for high-efficiency sorbents for I-129, a long-lived isotope evolved during irradiated UO2 nuclear fuel reprocessing. These chalcogel compositions are shown to possess an affinity for iodine gas, I2(g), at various concentrations in air and the affinity is attributed to a strong chemical attraction between the chalcogen and I2(g), according to the HSAB principle. The high sorption efficiency is facilitated by the high porosity as well as the exceptionally large surface area of the chalcogels.","","","Pacific Northwest National Lab.

Its neutron multiplication capability and low atomic weight make it very useful as a reflector in fission reactors. Its low atomic number and high chemical affinity for oxygen have led to its consideration as a plasma-facing material in fusion reactors. In both applications, the beryllium and the impurities in it become activated by neutrons, transmuting them to radionuclides, some of which are long-lived and difficult to dispose of. Also, gas production, notably helium and tritium, results in swelling, embrittlement, and cracking, which means that the beryllium must be replaced periodically, especially in fission reactors where dimensional tolerances must be maintained. It has long been known that neutron activation of inherent iron and cobalt in the beryllium results in significant {sup 60}Co activity. In 2001, it was discovered that activation of naturally occurring contaminants in the beryllium creates sufficient {sup 14}C and {sup 94}Nb to render the irradiated beryllium 'Greater-Than-Class-C' for disposal in U.S. radioactive waste facilities. It was further found that there was sufficient uranium impurity in beryllium that had been used in fission reactors up to that time that the irradiated beryllium had become transuranic in character, making it even more difficult to dispose of. In this paper we review the extent of the disposal issue, processes that have been investigated or considered for improving the disposability of irradiated beryllium, and approaches for recycling.","","","Idaho National Lab.

The irradiated samples have been characterized using in-situ ion channeling, ex-situ x-ray diffraction, and helium ion microscopy. Compared to monocrystalline 3C-SiC, a faster amorphization process in the nanocrystalline material (average grain size = 3.3 nm) is observed at 500 K. However, the nanograin grows with increasing ion fluence at 550 K and the grain size tends to saturate at high fluences. The striking contrast demonstrates a sharp transition from irradiation-induced interface-driven amorphization at 500 K to crystallization at 550 K. The results could show potential impacts of nanocrystalline SiC on nuclear fuel cladding and structural components of next-generation nuclear energy systems.","","","Pacific Northwest National Lab.

To achieve the best performance of these fuels during irradiation, optimization of the starting microstructure may be required by utilizing a heat treatment that results in the formation of uniform, Si-rich interaction layers between the U-Mo particles and Al-Si matrix. These layers behave in a stable manner under certain irradiation conditions. To identify the optimum heat treatment for producing these kinds of layers in a dispersion fuel plate, a systematic annealing study has been performed using actual dispersion fuel samples, which were fabricated at relatively low temperatures to limit the growth of any interaction layers in the samples prior to controlled heat treatment. These samples had different Al matrices with varying Si contents and were annealed between 450 and 525 C for up to 4 hours. The samples were then characterized using scanning electron microscopy (SEM) to examine the thickness, composition, and uniformity of the interaction layers. Image analysis was performed to quantify various attributes of the dispersion fuel microstructures that related to the development of the interaction layers. The most uniform layers were observed to form in fuel samples that had an Al matrix with at least 4 wt% Si and a heat treatment temperature of at least 475 C.","","","Idaho National Lab.

Lanthanide fission products are a major factor in limiting the lifetime of the fuel, because they migrate to the fuel slug peripheral surface where they participate in fuel-cladding chemical interactions (FCCI) with the steel cladding. Lanthanide carryover in recycled metal fuels can accelerate FCCI, as recycled lanthanides would likely segregate from the fuel phase, putting the lanthanides in prompt contact with the cladding. In out-of-pile tests we examined the use of Pd for binding the lanthanides, with Pd selected because of its known metallurgical properties in fuel related systems and because of its known behavior in irradiated EBR-II fuels. Initial results confirmed that palladium may be expected to mitigate FCCI arising from lanthanides, and it has been recommended for in-pile tests. We also evaluated transport phenomena responsible for lanthanide migration, and identified liquid-like behaviors as being dominant. Liquid-like behaviors include transport with liquid metals, liquid metal solutions, and rapid surface transport of alloys/metals near their melting temperatures. The analysis led to establishing general criteria for selecting alternate dopant additives, and identifying Sn, Sb, and Te as alternates for further testing.","","","Idaho National Lab.

We followed the mobility and aggregation of Xe atoms in the vacancy-saturated model compound for up to 2 ns. During this time we observed the aggregation of Xe atoms into nuclei, which are possible precursors to Xe bubbles. The nucleation was driven by the migration of Xe atoms via vacancy-assisted diffusion. The Xe clusters aggregate faster than grain boundary diffusion rates and are smaller than experimentally observed bubbles. As the system evolves to equilibrium, the vacancies reach a near steady-state distribution, the Xe atom cluster growth slows down significantly, and the lattice relaxes around the cluster. These simulations provide insights into fundamental physical processes that are inaccessible to experiment.","","","Pacific Northwest National Lab. (PNNL), Richland, WA (United States).

The strength of its complexes with trivalent americium (Am3+) and neodymium (Nd3+) in anhydrous methanol has been evaluated using spectrophotometric techniques. The purpose of this investigation is to assess this ligand (as representative of a class of similarly structured species) as a possible model compound for the challenging separation of trivalent actinides from lanthanides. This separation, important in the development of advanced nuclear fuel cycles, is best achieved through the agency of multidentate chelating agents containing some number of nitrogen or sulfur donor groups. To evaluate the relative strength of the bidentate complexes, the derived constants are compared to those of the same metal ions with 2,2*-bipyridyl (bipy), 1,10-phenanthroline (phen), and 2-pyridin-2-yl-1H-benzimidazole (PBIm). At issue is the relative affinity of the triazole moiety for trivalent f element ions. For all ligands, the derived stability constants are higher for Am3+ than Nd3+. In the case of Am3+ complexes with phen and PBIm, the presence of 1:2 (AmL2) species is indicated. Possible separations are suggested based on the relative stability and stoichiometry of the Am3+ and Nd3+ complexes. It can be noted that the 1,2,3-triazolyl group imparts a potentially useful selectivity for trivalent actinides (An(III)) over trivalent lanthanides (Ln(III)), though the attainment of higher complex stoichiometries in actinide compared with lanthanide complexes may be an important driver for developing successful separations.","","","Pacific Northwest National Lab.

In the spectral function of Mott-insulating uranium oxide, a resonance peak is observed in both theory and experiment and may be understood as a generalized Zhang-Rice state. We also investigate the interplay between electron-electron and electron-phonon interactions, both of which are responsible for the transport in the metallic compounds. Our findings allow us to gain insight in the roles played by different scattering mechanisms, and suggest how to improve their thermal conductivities.","","","","","","United States","2011-11-15T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: Physical Review.

Different ions and energies are used to study the effects of dose, temperature, atomic displacement rate and ionization rate on irradiation-induced amorphization and recrystallization. The dose for amorphization increases with temperature in two stages, below and above 150 K. In the high temperature stage relevant to actinide immobilization, the increase of amorphization dose with temperature exhibits a strong dependence on the ratio of ionization rate to displacement rate for the different ions. Data analysis using a dynamic model for amorphization reveals that ionization-induced processes, with activation energy of 0.15 {+-} 0.02 eV, dominate dynamic recovery for ions from Ne through Xe. For heavier Au ions or for alpha-recoil nuclei emitted in alpha decay of actinides, ionization becomes less dominant and dynamic recovery is controlled primarily by thermally-driven processes. In post-irradiation annealing studies of amorphous samples, epitaxial thermal recrystallization is observed at 1123 K, and irradiation-enhanced nucleation of nanocrystallites is observed under irradiation with heavier ions. The recrystallization temperature under irradiation decreases with increasing ion mass to a value of {approx} 823 K, which also defines the thermally-driven critical temperature for amorphization under irradiation with heavy ions. Some partial recovery due to alpha particle irradiation at 300 K is observed that suggests a self-healing mechanism in apatite phases containing actinides. Based on the results and dynamic model, the temperature and time dependences of amorphization in silicate-apatite host phases for actinide immobilization are predicted.","","","Pacific Northwest National Lab.

When oxidation was relatively uniform, Raman spectra collected using microscope optics with low spatial resolution were found to be similar to those collected with conventional Raman spectroscopy. These spectra could be used to identify major oxide corrosion products and follow changes in the composition of the oxides due to heating. However, when the oxidation films were comprised of multiple layers of varying composition, or with layers containing metallic phases, techniques with higher depth resolution and sensitivity to zero-valence metals were necessary. The requirements were met by combining Raman microprobe using different optical configurations and x-ray photoelectron spectroscopy.","","","Pacific Northwest National Lab.

Subsequent efforts adapted the vacuum salt distillation (VSD) technology for the removal of chloride and fluoride from less-volatile halide salts at the same process temperature and vacuum. Calcium chloride (CaCl{sub 2}), calcium fluoride (CaF{sub 2}), and plutonium fluoride (PuF{sub 3}) were of particular concern. To enable the use of the same operating conditions for the distillation process, SRNL employed in situ exchange reactions to convert the less-volatile halide salts to compounds that facilitated the distillation of halide without removal of plutonium.

This effectively removes uranium from solution resulting in groundwater concentrations below actionable standards. Three-dimensional, coupled variably-saturated flow and biogeochemical reactive transport modeling of a 2008 in situ uranium bioremediation field experiment is used to better understand the interplay of transport rates and biogeochemical reaction rates that determine the location and magnitude of key reaction products. A comprehensive reaction network, developed largely through previous 1-D modeling studies, was used to simulate the impacts on uranium behavior of pulsed acetate amendment, seasonal water table variation, spatially-variable physical (hydraulic conductivity, porosity) and geochemical (reactive surface area) material properties. A principal challenge is the mechanistic representation of biologically-mediated terminal electron acceptor process (TEAP) reactions whose products significantly alter geochemical controls on uranium mobility through increases in pH, alkalinity, exchangeable cations, and highly reactive reduction products. In general, these simulations of the 2008 Big Rusty acetate biostimulation field experiment in Rifle, Colorado confirmed previously identified behaviors including (1) initial dominance by iron reducing bacteria that concomitantly reduce aqueous U(VI), (2) sulfate reducing bacteria that become dominant after {approx}30 days and outcompete iron reducers for the acetate electron donor, (3) continuing iron-reducer activity and U(VI) bioreduction during dominantly sulfate reducing conditions, and (4) lower apparent U(VI) removal from groundwater during dominantly sulfate reducing conditions. New knowledge on simultaneously active metal and sulfate reducers has been incorporated into the modeling. In this case, an initially small population of slow growing sulfate reducers is active from the initiation of biostimulation. Three-dimensional, variably saturated flow modeling was used to address impacts of a falling water table during acetate injection. These impacts included a significant reduction in aquifer saturated thickness and isolation of residual reactants and products, as well as unmitigated uranium, in the newly unsaturated vadose zone. High permeability sandy gravel structures resulted in locally high flow rates in the vicinity of injection wells that increased acetate dilution. In downgradient locations, these structures created preferential flow paths for acetate delivery that enhanced local zones of TEAP reactivity and subsidiary reactions. Conversely, smaller transport rates associated with the lower permeability lithofacies (e.g., fine) and vadose zone were shown to limit acetate access and reaction. Once accessed by acetate, however, these same zones limited subsequent acetate dilution and provided longer residence times that resulted in higher concentrations of TEAP products when terminal electron donors and acceptors were not limiting. Finally, facies-based porosity and reactive surface area variations were shown to affect aqueous uranium concentration distributions; however, the ranges were sufficiently small to preserve general trends. Large computer memory and high computational performance were required to simulate the detailed coupled process models for multiple biogeochemical components in highly resolved heterogeneous materials for the 110-day field experiment and 50 days of post-biostimulation behavior. In this case, a highly-scalable subsurface simulator operating on 128 processor cores for 12 hours was used to simulate each realization. An equivalent simulation without parallel processing would have taken 60 days, assuming sufficient memory was available.","","","Pacific Northwest National Lab. (PNNL), Richland, WA (United States).

Scanning electron microscopy (SEM), transmission electron microscopy (TEM), and electron probe microanalysis (EPMA) were employed to examine the development of a very fine multiphase interaction layer with an approximately constant average composition of 80 at. pct Al. Extensive TEM was carried out to identify the constituent phases across the interaction layer based on selected area electron diffraction and convergent beam electron diffraction (CBED).

Residual stress from large differences in molar volume, evidenced by vertical cracks within the interaction layer, high Al mobility, Mo supersaturation, and partitioning toward equilibrium in the interdiffusion zone were employed to describe the complex microstructure and phase constituents observed.

Determining real anode surface area is a significant issue to be resolved for precisely modeling molten salt electrorefining. Based on a three-dimensional electrorefining model, calculated cell potentials compare with an experimental cell potential variation over 80 hours of operation of the Mark-IV electrorefiner with driver fuel from the Experimental Breeder Reactor II. We succeeded to achieve a good agreement with an overall trend of the experimental data with appropriate selection of a mode for real anode surface area, but there are still local inconsistencies between theoretical calculation and experimental observation. In addition, the results were validated and compared with two-dimensional results to identify possible uncertainty factors that had to be further considered in a computational electrorefining analysis. These uncertainty factors include material properties, heterogeneous material distribution, surface roughness, and current efficiency. Zirconium's abundance and complex behavior have more impact on uncertainty towards the latter period of electrorefining at given batch of fuel.

Availability of on-line real-time techniques that directly measure process concentrations of nuclear materials will enhance performance and proliferation resistance of the solvent extraction processes. Further, on-line monitoring of radiochemical streams will also improve reprocessing plant operation and safety. This report reviews current state of development of the spectroscopic on-line monitoring techniques for such solutions. To further examine applicability of optical spectroscopy for monitoring reprocessing solutions, segments of a spent nuclear fuel, with approximate burn-up values of 70 MWd/kgM, were dissolved in concentrated nitric acid and adjusted to varying final concentrations of HNO3. The resulting spent fuel solutions were batch-contacted with tributyl phosphate/dodecane organic solvent. The feed and equilibrium aqueous and loaded organic solutions were subjected to optical measurements. The obtained spectra showed the presence of the quantifiable Raman bands due to NO3- and UO22+ and Vis/NIR bands due to multiple species of Pu(IV), Pu(VI), Np(V), the Np(V)-U(VI) cation-cation complex, and Nd(III) in fuel solutions, justifying spectroscopic techniques as a promising methodology for monitoring spent fuel processing solutions in real-time. Quantitative evaluation of the fuel solution was performed based on spectroscopic measurements and compared to ICP-MS analysis.","","","Pacific Northwest National Lab.

The U-Mo fuel alloy dispersed in Al-Si alloy has attracted particular interest for this application. This paper reports our detailed characterization results of as-fabricated and annealed (475 Degrees C for 4 h) U-Mo dispersion fuels in Al-Si matrix with a Si concentration of 2 and 5 wt.%, named as As2Si, As5Si, An2Si, An5Si accordingly. Techniques employed for the characterization include scanning electron microscopy and transmission electron microscopy with specimen prepared by focused ion beam in situ lift-out. Fuel plates with Al-5 wt.% Si matrix consistently yielded thicker interaction layers developed between U-Mo particles and Al-Si matrix, than those with Al-2 wt.% Si matrix, given the same processing parameters. A single layer of interaction zone was observed in as-fabricated samples (i.e., As2Si, As5Si), and this layer mainly consisted of U3Si3Al2 phase. The annealed samples contained a two-layered interaction zone, with a Si-rich layer near the U-Mo side, and an Al-rich layer near the Al-Si matrix side. The U3Si5 appeared as the main phase in the Si-rich layer in An2Si sample, while both U3Si5 and U3Si3Al2 were identified in sample An5Si. The Al-rich layer in sample An2Si was amorphous, whereas that in sample An5Si mostly consisted of crystalline U(Al,Si)3, along with a small fraction of U(Al,Si)4 and U6Mo4Al43 phases. The influence of Si on the diffusion and reaction in the development of interaction layers in U(Mo)/Al(Si) is discussed in the light of growth-controlling mechanisms and irradiation performance.","","","Idaho National Lab.

In specific, typical air monitoring of radioactive gases or particulate involves complex systems of valves, pumps, piping and electronics. The challenge is to measure a representative sample in areas that are radioactively contaminated. Running cables and piping to these locations is very expensive due to the containment requirements. Penetration into and out of an airborne or containment area is complex and costly. The process rooms are built with thick rebar-enforced concrete walls with glove box containment chambers inside. Figure 1 shows high temperature radiation resistance cabling entering the top of a typical glove box. In some case, the entire processing area must be contained in a 'hot cell' where the only access into the chamber is via manipulators. An example is shown in Figure 2. A short range wireless network provides an ideal communication link for transmitting the data from the radiation sensor to a 'clean area', or area absent of any radiation fields or radioactive contamination. Radiation monitoring systems that protect personnel and equipment must meet stringent codes and standards due to the consequences of failure. At first glance a wired system would seem more desirable. Concerns with wireless communication include latency, jamming, spoofing, man in the middle attacks, and hacking. The Department of Energy's Savannah River National Laboratory (SRNL) has developed a prototype wireless radiation air monitoring system that address many of the concerns with wireless and allows quick deployment in radiation and contamination areas. It is stand alone and only requires a standard 120 VAC, 60 Hz power source. It is designed to be mounted or portable. The wireless link uses a National Security Agency (NSA) Suite B compliant wireless network from Fortress Technologies that is considered robust enough to be used for classified data transmission in place of NSA Type 1 devices.","","available","Savannah River Site (SRS), Aiken, SC (United States)","USDOE","","United States","2011-08-03T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: IEEE Instrumentation and Measurement","","Medium: ED","","SRNL-STI-2011-00449","DE-AC09-08SR22470","TRN: US1103990","10.1109/MIM.2011.6086894","","2013-01-10T00:00:00Z","1021456","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/1021456","https://www.osti.gov/servlets/purl/1021456","IEEE Instrumentation and Measurement","",""

C.","11 NUCLEAR FUEL CYCLE AND FUEL MATERIALS; 12 MANAGEMENT OF RADIOACTIVE AND NON-RADIOACTIVE WASTES FROM NUCLEAR FACILITIES; nuclear (including radiation effects), materials and chemistry by design, synthesis (novel materials), synthesis (self-assembly)","During the past 70 years, more than 2000 metric tonnes of Pu, and substantial quantities of the 'minor' actinides such as Np, Am and Cm, have been generated in nuclear reactors. Some of these transuranium elements can be a source of energy in fission reactions (e.g. ²³⁹Pu), a source of fissile material for nuclear weapons (e.g. ²³⁹Pu and ²³⁷Np), and of environmental concern because of their long half-lives and radiotoxicity (e.g. ²³⁹Pu and ²³⁷Np). There are two basic strategies for the disposition of these transuranium elements: (1) to 'burn' or fission the actinides using nuclear reactors or accelerators; (2) to dispose of the actinides directly as spent nuclear fuel or to 'sequester' the actinides in chemically durable, radiation-resistant materials that are also suitable for geological disposal. For the latter strategy, there has been substantial interest in the use of actinide-bearing minerals, especially isometric pyrochlore, A ₂ B ₂O₇ (A = rare earths; B = Ti, Zr, Sn, Hf), for the immobilization of actinides, particularly plutonium, both as inert matrix fuels and nuclear waste forms. Systematic studies of rare-earth pyrochlores have led to the discovery that certain compositions (B = Zr, Hf) are stable to very high doses of a -decay event damage. Recent developments in the understanding of the properties of actinide-bearing solids have opened up new possibilities for the design of advanced nuclear materials that can be used as fuels and waste forms. As an example, the amount of radiation damage that accumulates over time can be controlled by the selection of an appropriate composition for the pyrochlore and a consideration of the thermal environment of disposal. In the case of deep borehole disposal (3–5 km), the natural geothermal gradient may provide enough heat to reduce the amount of accumulated radiation damage bythermal annealing.","Mineralogical Society","","Energy Frontier Research Centers (EFRC) (United States).

Depending on the application, those criteria may consist of any combination of physical or chemical characteristics and/or various neutronic parameters. The ICSBEP Handbook contains a structured format helping the user narrow the search for experiments of interest. However, with nearly 4300 different experimental configurations and the ever increasing addition of experimental data, the necessity to perform multiple criteria searches have rendered these features insufficient. As a result, a relational database was created with information extracted from the ICSBEP Handbook. A users’ interface was designed by OECD and DOE to allow the interrogation of this database. The database and the corresponding users’ interface are referred to as DICE. DICE currently offers the capability to perform multiple criteria searches that go beyond simple fuel, physical form and spectra and includes expanded general information, fuel form, moderator/coolant, neutron-absorbing material, cladding, reflector, separator, geometry, benchmark results, spectra, and neutron balance parameters.

These core and depletion models depend on various computer codes. This research used MCNPX 2.6.0 and ERANOS 2.1 to model a standard 250MWt Advanced Burner Test Reactor (ABTR) core. The intent was to benchmark criticality and burnup results from a stochastic Monte Carlo code and a deterministic depletion code using a standard ABTR model created by Argonne National Laboratory. Because each of these codes solve the transport and burnup problem differently, there is a need to benchmark the core models in order to verify results and identify root causes for significant differences in results between codes. Flux calculations in ERANOS were performed using diffusion theory, Legendre polynomial approximations (using the VARIANT module) and discrete ordinates methods. The k-effective for the higher-order transport models remained within 1000 pcm of the MCNPX model. The difference between the total heavy nuclide mass balance in ERANOS using the various flux calculations and the MCNPX depletion model was less than 0.4% out to a burnup of 1095 days (67.45 GWd/MTHM). For individual heavy nuclides, the depletion models closely matched (< 5.0 % difference) throughout the depletion for isotopes of Uranium, Neptunium and Plutonium and most of the higher transuranics. Notable exceptions were 242Am, 242Cm, 243Cm and 246Cm where differences ranged from 0.1 – 0.2% after 26 days and increased to 11 - 136% at 1095 days.","","","Idaho National Lab.

Enhanced capabilities are described, including: UO2 temperature and burnup dependent thermal properties, solid and gaseous fission product swelling, fuel densification, fission gas release, cladding thermal and irradiation creep, cladding irradiation growth, gap heat transfer, and gap/plenum gas behavior during irradiation. This new capability is demonstrated using a 2D axisymmetric analysis of the upper section of a simplified multipellet fuel rod, during both steady and transient operation. Comparisons are made between discrete and smeared-pellet simulations. Computational results demonstrate the importance of a multidimensional, multipellet, fully-coupled thermomechanical approach. Interestingly, many of the inherent deficiencies in existing fuel performance codes (e.g., 1D thermomechanics, loose thermomechanical coupling, separate steady and transient analysis, cumbersome pre- and post-processing) are, in fact, ABAQUS strengths.","","","Idaho National Lab.

"Monte Carlo Criticality Analysis of Simple Geometrics COntaining Tungsten Rhenium Alloys Engrained with Uranium Dioxide and Uranium Mononitride","Webb, Jonathan A; Charit, Indrajit","11 NUCLEAR FUEL CYCLE AND FUEL MATERIALS; ALLOYS; CRITICAL MASS; CRITICALITY; DIMENSIONS; FRESH WATER; RADIATION ACCIDENTS; RHENIUM; RHENIUM ADDITIONS; RHENIUM ALLOYS; TUNGSTEN; URANIUM; URANIUM 228; URANIUM 235; URANIUM DIOXIDE; WATER; Criticality Analysis; Geometrics; Tungsten-Rhenium Alloys","The critical mass and dimensions of simple geometries containing highly enriched uraniumdioxide (UO2) and uraniummononitride (UN) encapsulated in tungsten-rhenium alloys are determined using MCNP5 criticality calculations. Spheres as well as cylinders with length to radius ratios of 1.82 are computationally built to consist of 60 vol.% fuel and 40 vol.% metal matrix. Within the geometries the uranium is enriched to 93 wt.% uranium-235 and the rhenium content within the metal alloy was modeled over a range of 0 to 30 at.%. The spheres containing UO2 were determined to have a critical radius of 18.29 cm to 19.11 cm and a critical mass ranging from 366 kg to 424 kg. The cylinders containing UO2 were found to have a critical radius ranging from 17.07 cm to 17.844 cm with a corresponding critical mass of 406 kg to 471 kg. Spheres engrained with UN were determined to have a critical radius ranging from 14.82 cm to 15.19 cm and a critical mass between 222 kg and 242 kg. Cylinders which were engrained with UN were determined to have a critical radius ranging from 13.811 cm to 14.155 cm with a corresponding critical mass of 245 kg to 267 kg. The critical geometries were also computationally submerged in a neutronaically infinite medium of fresh water to determine the effects of rhenium addition on criticality accidents due to water submersion. The monte carlo analysis demonstrated that rhenium addition of up to 30 at.% can reduce the excess reactivity due to water submersion by up to $5.07 for UO2 fueled cylinders, $3.87 for UO2 fueled spheres and approximately $3.00 for UN fueled spheres and cylinders.","","","Idaho National Lab.

Applications involving thermomechanical contact scenarios are also quite prevalent. Such problems can be challenging to solve due to the likelihood of thermal expansion affecting contact geometry which, in turn, can change the thermal behavior of the components being analyzed. This paper explores a simple model of a light water reactor nuclear fuel rod, which consists of cylindrical pellets of uranium dioxide (UO{sub 2}) fuel sealed within a Zircalloy cladding tube. The tube is initially filled with helium gas, which fills the gap between the pellets and cladding tube. The accurate modeling of heat transfer across the gap between fuel pellets and the protective cladding is essential to understanding fuel performance, including cladding stress and behavior under irradiated conditions, which are factors that affect the lifetime of the fuel. The thermomechanical contact approach developed here is based on the mortar finite element method, where Lagrange multipliers are used to enforce weak continuity constraints at participating interfaces. In this formulation, the heat equation couples to linear mechanics through a thermal expansion term. Lagrange multipliers are used to formulate the continuity constraints for both heat flux and interface traction at contact interfaces. The resulting system of nonlinear algebraic equations are cast in residual form for solution of the transient problem. A Jacobian-free Newton Krylov method is used to provide for fully-coupled solution of the coupled thermal contact and heat equations.","","Available from http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jcp.2011.04.038","","","","United States","2011-07-20T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: Journal of Computational Physics; Journal Volume: 230; Journal Issue: 17; Other Information: DOI: 10.1016/j.jcp.2011.04.038; PII: S0021-9991(11)00286-5; Copyright (c) 2011 Elsevier Science B.V., Amsterdam, The Netherlands, All rights reserved.; Country of input: International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA)","","Medium: X; Size: page(s) 6546-6562","","","","Journal ID: ISSN 0021-9991; JCTPAH; TRN: US12R0665070592","10.1016/j.jcp.2011.04.038","","2012-12-11T00:00:00Z","21592601","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/21592601","","Journal of Computational Physics","17","230"

Facility modeling that can integrate and interpret observations collected from monitored facilities in order to ascertain their functional details will be a critical element of these methods. Although improvements are continually sought, existing facility modeling tools can characterize all aspects of reactor operations and the majority of nuclear fuel cycle processing steps, and include algorithms for data processing and interpretation. Assessing nonproliferation status is challenging because observations can come from many sources, including local and remote sensors that monitor facility operations, as well as open sources that provide specific business information about the monitored facilities, and can be of many different types. Although many current facility models are capable of analyzing large amounts of information, they have not been integrated in an analyst-friendly manner. This paper addresses some of these facility modeling capabilities and illustrates how they could be integrated and utilized for nonproliferation analysis. The inverse problem of inferring facility conditions based on collected observations is described, along with a proposed architecture and computer framework for utilizing facility modeling tools. After considering a representative sampling of key facility modeling capabilities, the proposed integration framework is illustrated with several examples.","","available","Savannah River Site (SRS), Aiken, SC (United States)","USDOE","","United States","2011-07-18T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: Progress in Nuclear Energy","","Medium: ED","","SRNL-STI-2011-00426","DE-AC09-08SR22470","Journal ID: ISSN 0149-1970; PNENDE; TRN: US1104748","","","2014-10-10T00:00:00Z","1024475","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/1024475","https://www.osti.gov/servlets/purl/1024475","Progress in Nuclear Energy","",""

"Experimental Study of the Effect of Graphite Dispersion on the Heat Transfer Phenomena in a Reactor Cavity Cooling System","Vaghetto, Rodolfo; Capone, Luigi; Hassan, Yassin A","11 NUCLEAR FUEL CYCLE AND FUEL MATERIALS","An experimental activity was performed to observe and study the effects of graphite dispersion and deposition on thermal-hydraulic phenomena in a reactor cavity cooling system (RCCS). The small-scale RCCS experimental facility (16.5 x 16.5 x 30.4 cm) used for this activity represents half of the reactor cavity with an electrically heated vessel. Water flowing through five vertical pipes removes the heat produced in the vessel and releases it into the environment by mixing with cold water in a large tank. The particle image velocimetry technique was used to study the velocity field of the air inside the cavity. A set of 52 thermocouples was installed in the facility to monitor the temperature profiles of the vessel, pipe walls, and air. Ten grams of a fine graphite powder (average particle size 2 m) was injected into the cavity through a spraying nozzle placed at the bottom of the vessel. The temperatures and air velocity field were recorded and compared with the measurements obtained before the graphite dispersion, showing a decrease of the temperature surfaces that was related to an increase in their emissivity. The results contribute to the understanding of RCCS capability in an accident scenario.","","http://epubs.ans.org/?a=13367","Texas A & M Univ., College Station, TX (United States).

The thermodynamic and kinetic properties such as chemical free energy, interfacial energy, vacancy mobility, and annihilation rate of vacancies and interstitials are generally expressed as functions of the temperature. The developed model enables one to parametrically study critical void nucleus size, void growth kinetics, and void volume fraction evolutions.

The applied deformation accelerates the grain growth compared to a relaxed polycrystal, though the effect of the deformation decreases rapidly with time. The softest grain orientations with respect to the applied deformation grow at the expense of other orientations, though they have higher elastic energy density. Due to a rapid decrease in the elastic energy stored in the system, the GB energy eventually dominates the growth leading to a linear change in the average grain area with time. Increasing the magnitude of the applied deformation accelerates the growth, while increasing the temperature accelerates the growth but decreases the effect of the applied deformation.","","","Idaho National Lab.

While a γ' intermediate phase was not observed at either -120 °C or -155 °C, an unexplained shoulder on the δ (1 1 1) peak was detected at -155 °C.

The most favorable combinations are not limited by abundance sensitivity; rather, the limitations are the ability to generate a uranium ion beam of sufficient intensity to obtain the required number of counts on the minor isotopes in relationship to detector background. The most favorable situations can measure isotope ratios in the range of E10 if sufficient sample intensity is available. These are the triple sector mass spectrometer with porous ion emitters (PIE) and the single sector mass spectrometer with energy filtering.","","","Idaho National Lab.

The applied deformation accelerates the growth compared to a relaxed polycrystal, though the effect of the deformation decreases rapidly with time. The softest grain orientations with respect to the applied deformation grow at the expense of other orientations, such that a texture forms during the growth. Due to a rapid decrease in the elastic energy stored in the system, the GB energy eventually dominates the growth leading to a linear change in the average grain area with time. Increasing the magnitude of the applied deformation accelerates the growth while an increase in temperature accelerates the growth but slows the initial texture development.","","","Idaho National Lab.

This subcritical assembly was constructed to study the physics and the operation of accelerator-driven subcritical systems (ADS) for transmuting the light water reactors (LWR) spent nuclear fuel. The YALINA Booster facility has been accurately modeled, with no material homogenization, by the Monte Carlo codes MCNPX (MCNP/MCB) and MONK. The MONK geometrical model matches that of MCNPX. The assembly has also been analyzed by the deterministic code ERANOS. In addition, the differences between the effective neutron multiplication factor and the source multiplication factors have been examined by alternative calculational methodologies. The analyses include the delayed neutron fraction, prompt neutron lifetime, generation time, neutron flux profiles, and spectra in various experimental channels. The accuracy of the numerical models has been enhanced by accounting for all material impurities and the actual density of the polyethylene material used in the assembly (the latter value was obtained by dividing the total weight of the polyethylene by its volume in the numerical model). There is good agreement between the results from MONK, MCNPX, and ERANOS. The ERANOS results show small differences relative to the other results because of material homogenization and the energy and angle discretizations.The MCNPX results match the experimental measurements of the {sup 3}He(n,p) reaction rates obtained with the californium neutron source.","","","Argonne National Lab.

To improve the understanding of the as-fabricated microstructures of U–Mo dispersion fuel plates, particularly the interaction layers that can form between the fuel particles and the matrix, scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and transmission electron microscopy (TEM) analyses have been performed on samples from depleted U–7Mo (U–7Mo) dispersion fuel plates with either Al–2 wt.% Si(Al–2Si) or AA4043 alloy matrix. It was observed that in the thick interaction layers, U(Al, Si)3 and U6Mo4Al43 were present, and in the thin interaction layers, (U, Mo) (Al, Si)3, U(Al, Si)4, U3Si3Al2, U3Si5, and possibly USi-type phases were observed. The U3Si3Al2 phase contained some Mo. Based on the results of this investigation, the time that a dispersion fuel plate is exposed to a relatively high temperature during fabrication will impact the nature of the interaction layers around the fuel particles. Uniformly thin, Si-rich layers will develop around the U–7Mo particles for shorter exposure times, and thicker, Si-depleted layers will develop for the longer exposure times.","","","Idaho National Lab.

The measured contents of the two species were determined using a general detector efficiency calibration taken from a 12-inch point source.2 The authors corrected the raw spectra for container absorption as well as for geometry corrections to transform the calibration curve to the applicable axial symmetric cylindrical source - and disk source - of contamination. The authors derived the geometry corrections with exact calculus that are shown in equations (1) and (2) of our Experimental section. A cylindrical shell (oven source) acquisition configuration is described in reference 3, where the authors disclosed this configuration to gain improved sensitivity for holdup measure of U-235 in a ten-chamber oven. The oven was a piece of process equipment used in the Savannah River Plant M-Area Uranium Fuel Fabrication plant for which a U-235 holdup measurement was necessary for its decontamination and decommissioning in 2003.4 In reference 4 the authors calibrated a bare NaI detector for these U-235 holdup measurements. In references 5 and 6 the authors calibrated a bare HpGe detector in a cylindrical shell configuration for improved sensitivity measurements of U-235 in other M-Area process equipment. Sensitivity was vastly improved compared to a close field view of the sample, with detection efficiency of greater than 1% for the 185.7-keV {gamma}-ray from U-235. In none of references 3 - 7 did the authors resolve the exact calculus descriptions of the acquisition configurations. Only the empirical efficiency for detection of the 185.7-keV photon from U-235 decay was obtained. Not until the 2010 paper of reference 1 did the authors derive a good theoretical description of the flux of photons onto the front face of a detector from an axially symmetric cylindrical shell. Subsequent to publication of 1, the theoretical treatment of the cylindrical shell and disk source acquisition sources was recognized by the Los Alamos National Laboratory as suitable for including in the Safeguards Training Program.8 Therefore, we felt it was important to accurately demonstrate the calculus describing the cylindrical shell configuration for the HpGe detector and to theoretically account for the observed bare-detector efficiencies measured in references (3-6). In this paper we demonstrate the applicability of the cylindrical shell derivation to a flexible planar sheet of known Am-241, Eu-152, and Cs-137 activity that we rolled into a symmetrical cylindrical shell of radioactivity. Using the geometry correction equation of reference 1, we calculate geometry correction values using the known detector and source dimensions combined with source to detector distances. We then compare measured detection efficiencies from a cylindrical shell of activity for the 185.7-keV photon (U-235) and for the 414.3-keV photon (Pu-239) with those determined for a 12-inch point source(2,7) to demonstrate agreement between experiment and the theoretically calculated values derived by the Savannah River National Laboratory (SRNL) authors of reference 1. We demonstrate this geometry correction first for the 185.7- and 414.3-keV {gamma}-rays. But because the detector was point source calibrated at 12 inches for the energy range (60 -1700) keV (using two distinct sources) to map its intrinsic efficiency, the geometry correction for any acquisition configuration holds for all photon energies.2 We demonstrate that for ten photon energies in the range 121 keV to 967 keV. The good agreement between experiment and calculation is demonstrated at five source to detector distances using the identical shielded HpGe detector of references 4-7 as well as with a separate HpGe detector. We then extend the measurement to include a single acquisition where the flexible source is wrapped around the bare detector in a symmetrical cylinder that radiates on both faces of the detector as well as on to the detector's cylindrical sides of known dimensions. We derive the exact calculus to calculate the flux of the source on to the cylindrical sides of the detector. We then demonstrate outstanding agreement between the measured efficiency for the two primary U-235 and Pu-239 photons in this oven source configuration compared to the point source of activity for which the detector was originally calibrated.","","available","Savannah River Site (SRS), Aiken, SC (United States)","USDOE","","United States","2011-04-29T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: Review of Scientific Instruments","","Medium: ED","","SRNS-STI-2011-00224","DE-AC09-08SR22470","Journal ID: ISSN 0034-6748; RSINAK; TRN: US1102604","","","2011-06-06T00:00:00Z","1014144","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/1014144","https://www.osti.gov/servlets/purl/1014144","Review of Scientific Instruments","",""

We have found that the gamma-ray field in the target room 'disappears' 10 milliseconds after the x-ray flash, and that gamma ray spectroscopy will then be dominated by isomeric states/beta decay of fission products. When a polyethylene moderator is added to the DU target, a time-dependent signature of the DU is produced by thermalized neutrons. We observe this signature in gamma-spectra measured consecutively in the 0.1-1.0 ms time range.

The radiation stability of ILs is an important concern for some of these applications, as previous studies suggested extensive fragmentation of the constituent ions upon irradiation. In the present study, electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR) spectroscopy has been used to identify fragmentation pathways for constituent anions in ammonium, phosphonium, and imidazolium ILs. Many of these detrimental reactions are initiated by radiation-induced redox processes involving these anions. Scission of the oxidized anions is the main fragmentation pathway for the majority of the practically important anions; (internal) proton transfer involving the aliphatic arms of these anions is a competing reaction. For perfluorinated anions, fluoride loss following dissociative electron attachment to the anion can be even more prominent than this oxidative fragmentation. Bond scission in the anion was also observed for NO{sub 3}{sup -} and B(CN){sub 4}{sup -} anions and indirectly implicated for BF{sub 4}{sup -} and PF{sub 6}{sup -} anions. Among small anions, CF{sub 3}SO{sub 3}{sup -} and N(CN){sub 2}{sup -} are the most stable. Among larger anions, the derivatives of benzoate and imide anions were found to be relatively stable. This stability is due to suppression of the oxidative fragmentation. For benzoates, this is a consequence of the extensive sharing of unpaired electron density by the {pi}-system in the corresponding neutral radical; for the imides, this stability could be the consequence of N-N {sigma}{sup 2}{sigma}*{sup 1} bond formation involving the parent anion. While fragmentation does not occur for these 'exceptional' anions, H atom addition and electron attachment are prominent. Among the typically used constituent anions, aliphatic carboxylates were found to be the least resistant to oxidative fragmentation, followed by (di)alkyl phosphates and alkanesulfonates. The discussion of the radiation stability of ILs is continued in the second part of this study, which examines the fate of organic cations in such liquids.","","","Argonne National Lab.

In chloroform solutions also containing a crown ether (CE), water molecules strongly associate with the IL ions, and there is rapid proton exchange between these bound water molecules and hydronium associated with the CE. In neat ILs, the acids form clusters differing in their degree of association and ionization, and their interactions with the CEs are weak. The CE can either promote proton exchange between different clusters in IL solution when their association is weak or inhibit such exchange when the association is strong. Even strongly hydrophobic ILs are shown to readily extract nitric acid from aqueous solution, typically via the formation of a 1:1:1 {l_brace}H{sub 3}O{sup +} {center_dot} CE{r_brace}NO{sub 3}{sup -} complex.

Additionally, two specimens were fatigued to the edge of the nickel interlayer and then monotonically loaded. Micro-hardness profiles of the nickel interlayer were also measured. Fatigue behavior was found to be similar to previous studies in that arrest was only noted in the near threshold Paris regime (attributed to the presence of voids) and in the steady state regime exhibited an acceleration of crack growth rate through the nickel interlayer followed by a slight retardation. Monotonic loading resulted in crack branching or delamination along the interlayer.

The only current method for the direct oxidation of americium to Am(V) in strongly acidic media is with sodium bismuthate. We prepared Am(V) over a wide range of nitric acid concentrations and investigated its solvent extraction behavior for comparison to europium. While a separation is achievable in principal, the presence of macro amounts of cerium competes for the sparingly soluble oxidant and the oxidant itself competes for CMPO complexation. These factors conspire to reduce the Eu/Am separation factor from ~40 using tracer solutions to ~5 for extractions from first cycle raffinate simulant solution. To separate pentavalent americium directly from the lanthanides using the TRUEX process, an alternative oxidizing agent will be necessary.","","","Idaho National Lab.

This paper summarizes those insights from the context of the 2005 objectives and goals of the U.S. Advanced Fuel Cycle Initiative (AFCI). Our intent is not to compare options, assess options versus those objectives and goals, nor recommend changes to those objectives and goals. Rather, we organize what we have learned from dynamic simulations in the context of the AFCI objectives for waste management, proliferation resistance, uranium utilization, and economics. Thus, we do not merely describe “lessons learned” from dynamic simulations but attempt to answer the “so what” question by using this context. The analyses have been performed using the Verifiable Fuel Cycle Simulation of Nuclear Fuel Cycle Dynamics (VISION). We observe that the 2005 objectives and goals do not address many of the inherently dynamic discriminators among advanced fuel cycle options and transitions thereof.","","","Idaho National Lab.

Therefore, Annular Centrifugal Contactors (ACCs) are destined to play a more important role for such future processing schemes. This work continues the development of remote designs for ACCs that can process the large throughputs needed for future nuclear fuel recycling and radioactive waste treatment plants. A three stage, 12.5 cm diameter rotor module has been constructed and is being evaluated for use in highly radioactive environments. This prototype assembly employs three standard CINC V-05 clean-in-place (CIP) units modified for remote service and replacement via new methods of connection for solution inlets, outlets, drain and CIP. Hydraulic testing and functional checks were successfully conducted and then the prototype was evaluated for remote handling and maintenance. Removal and replacement of the center position V-05R contactor in the three stage assembly was demonstrated using an overhead rail mounted PaR manipulator. Initial evaluation indicates a viable new design for interconnecting and cleaning individual stages while retaining the benefits of commercially reliable ACC equipment. Replacement of a single stage via remote manipulators and tools is estimated to take about 30 minutes, perhaps fast enough to support a contactor change without loss of process equilibrium. The design presented in this work is scalable to commercial ACC models from V-05 to V-20 with total throughput rates ranging from 20 to 650 liters per minute.","","","Idaho National Lab.

The transport network submodel is an integrated-parameter, computational fluid dynamics solver, describing the thermal-hydrologic transport processes in the flow channel system of the cavity with laminar or turbulent flow and convective heat and mass transport, using MULTIFLUX. The porous medium submodel, using TOUGH2, is a solver for the heat and mass transport in the fractured rock mass. The new model solution extends the application fields of TOUGH2 by integrating it with turbulent flow and transport in a discrete flow network system. We present demonstrational results for a nuclear waste repository application at Yucca Mountain with the most realistic model assumptions and input parameters including the geometrical layout of the nuclear spent fuel and waste with variable heat load for the individual containers. The MULTIFLUX and TOUGH2 model elements are fully iterated, applying a programmed reprocessing of the Numerical Transport Code Functionalization model-element in an automated Outside Balance Iteration loop. The natural, convective airflow field and the heat and mass transport in a representative emplacement drift during postclosure are explicitly solved in the new model. The results demonstrate that the direction and magnitude of the air circulation patterns and all transport modes are strongly affected by the heat and moisture transport processes in the surrounding rock, justifying the need for a coupled, fully iterated model solution such as the one presented in the paper.","","","Lawrence Berkeley National Lab.

Ideally, the envisioned technologies would be capable of nondestructive, near-real-time, autonomous process monitoring. This paper describes recent results from model simulations designed to test the Multi-Isotope Process (MIP) monitor, a novel approach to safeguarding reprocessing plants. The MIP monitor combines the detection of intrinsic gamma ray signatures emitted from process solutions with multivariate analysis to detect off-normal conditions in process streams nondestructively and in near-real-time. Three computer models including ORIGEN-ARP, AMUSE, and SYNTH were used in series to predict spent nuclear fuel composition, estimate element partitioning during separation, and simulate spectra from product and raffinate streams using a variety of gamma detectors, respectively. Simulations were generated for fuel with various irradiation histories and under a variety of plant operating conditions. Principal component analysis (PCA) was applied to the simulated gamma spectra to investigate pattern variations as a function of acid concentration, burnup, and cooling time. Hierarchical cluster analysis (HCA) and partial least squares (PLS) were also used in the analysis. The MIP monitor was found to be sensitive to induced variations of several operating parameters including distinguishing ±2.5% variation from normal process acid concentrations. The ability of PLS to predict burnup levels from simulated spectra was also demonstrated to be within 3.5% of measured values.","","","Pacific Northwest National Lab.

As part of this model, the two-dimensional potential and current distributions within the molten salt electrolyte are calculated for U3+ , Zr4+ , and Pu3+ along with the total distributions, using the partial differential equation solver of the commercial Matlab software. The electrical conductivity of the electrolyte solution is shown to depend primarily on the composition of the electrolyte and to average 205 mho/m with a standard deviation of 2.5 × 10-5% throughout the electrorefining process. These distributions show that the highest potential gradients (thus, the highest current) exist directly between the two anodes and cathode. The total, uranium, and plutonium potential gradients are shown to increase throughout the process, with a slight decrease in that of zirconium.

"Safe management of actinides in the nuclear fuel cycle: Role of mineralogy","Ewing, Rodney C.","11 NUCLEAR FUEL CYCLE AND FUEL MATERIALS; nuclear (including radiation effects), materials and chemistry by design, synthesis (novel materials), synthesis (self-assembly)","During the past 60 years, more than 1800 metric tonnes of Pu, and substantial quantities of the “minor” actinides, such as Np, Am and Cm, have been generated in nuclear reactors. Some of these transuranium elements can be a source of energy in fission reactions (e.g., 239Pu), a source of fissile material for nuclear weapons (e.g., 239Pu and 237Np), and of environmental concern because of their long-half lives and radiotoxicity (e.g., 239Pu and 237Np). There are two basic strategies for the disposition of these heavy elements: (1) to “burn” or transmute the actinides using nuclear reactors or accelerators; (2) to “sequester” the actinides in chemically durable, radiation-resistant materials that are suitable for geologic disposal. There has been substantial interest in the use of actinide-bearing minerals, especially isometric pyrochlore, A2B2O7 (A = rare earths; B = Ti, Zr, Sn, Hf), for the immobilization of actinides, particularly plutonium, both as inert matrix fuels and nuclear waste forms. Systematic studies of rare-earth pyrochlores have led to the discovery that certain compositions (B = Zr, Hf) are stable to very high doses of alpha-decay event damage. Recent developments in our understanding of the properties of heavy element solids have opened up new possibilities for the design of advanced nuclear fuels and waste forms.","","","Energy Frontier Research Centers (EFRC) (United States).

Based upon experience in the U.S., both metal and mixed oxide (MOX) fuel types are discussed in terms of potential performance effects created by the increased operating temperatures. Assembly outlet temperatures of 600, 650 and 700 °C were used as goal temperatures. Fuel/cladding chemical interaction (FCCI) and fuel melting, as well as challenges to the mechanical integrity of the cladding material, were identified as the limiting phenomena. For example, starting with a recent 1000 MWth fast reactor design, raising the outlet temperature to 650 °C through pin power increase increased the MOX centerline temperature to more than 3300 °C and the metal fuel peak cladding temperature to more than 700 °C. These exceeded limitations to fuel performance; fuel melting was limiting for MOX and FCCI for metal fuel. Both could be alleviated by design ‘fixes’, such as using a barrier inside the cladding to minimize FCCI in the metal fuel, or using annular fuel in the case of MOX. Both would also require an advanced cladding material with improved stress rupture properties. While some of these are costly, the benefits of having a high-temperature reactor which can support hydrogen production, or other missions requiring high process heat may make the extra costs justified.","","","Idaho National Lab.

The reactor design incorporates zirconium hydride moderating rods in an axial blanket above the active core. The blanket design traps the active core’s axial leakage for the purpose of transmuting Am-241 into Pu-238. This Pu-238 is then co-recycled with the spent driver fuel to make new driver fuel. Because Pu-238 is significantly more fissile than Am-241 in a fast neutron spectrum, the fissile worth of the initial minor actinide material is upgraded by its preconditioning via transmutation in the axial targets. Because, the Am-241 neutron capture worth is significantly stronger in a moderated epithermal spectrum than the fast spectrum, the axial targets serve as a neutron trap which recovers the axial leakage lost by the active core. The sodium fast reactor proposed by this work is designed as an overall transuranic burner. Therefore, a low transuranic conversion ratio is achieved by a degree of core flattening which increases axial leakage. Unlike a traditional “pancake” design, neutron leakage is recovered by the axial target/blanket system. This heterogeneous core design is constrained to have sodium void and Doppler reactivity worth similar to that of an equivalent homogeneous design. Because minor actinides are irradiated only once in the axial target region; elemental partitioning is not required. This fact enables the use of metal targets with electrochemical reprocessing. Therefore, the irradiation environment of both drivers and targets was constrained to ensure applicability of the established experience database for metal alloy sodium fast reactor fuels.","","","Idaho National Lab.

As nuclear fuel cycles propagate around the globe, the need for improved materials accountancy techniques for irradiated light-water reactor fuel will increase. This modeling study investigates the use of delayed gamma rays from fission-product nuclei to directly measure the relative concentrations of U-235, Pu-239, and Pu-241 in spent fuel assemblies. The method is based on the unique distribution of fission-product nuclei produced from fission in each of these fissile isotopes. Fission is stimulated in the assembly with a pulse-capable source of interrogating neutrons. The measured distributions of the short-lived fission products from the unknown sample are then fit with a linear combination of the known fission-product yield curves from pure U-235, Pu-239, and Pu-241 to determine the original proportions of these fissile isotopes. Modeling approaches for the intense gamma-ray background promulgated by the long-lived fission-product inventory and for the high-energy gamma-ray signatures emitted by short-lived fission products from induced fission are described. Benchmarking measurements are presented and compare favorably with the results of these models. Results for the simulated assay of simplified individual fuel elements ranging from fresh to 60 GWd/MTU burnup demonstrate the utility of the modeling methods for viability studies, although additional work is needed to more realistically assess the potential of High-Energy Delayed Gamma Spectroscopy (HEDGS).","","","Pacific Northwest National Lab.

The successful implementation of the Romanian shipment also brought various new technology in the program, further used by other participating countries. Until 2009, the RRRFR program repatriated to the Russian Federation HEU spent nuclear fuel of Russian origin from many countries, like Uzbekistan, Czech Republic, Latvia, Hungary, Kazakhstan and Bulgaria. The means of transport used were various; from specialized TK-5 train for the carriage of Russian TUK-19 transport casks, to platform trains for 20 ft freight ISO containers carrying Czech Skoda VPVR/M casks; from river barge on the Danube, to vessel on the Mediterranean Sea and Atlantic Ocean. Initially, in 2005, the transport plan of the HEU spent nuclear fuel from the National Institute for R&amp;D in Nuclear Physics and Nuclear Engineering 'Horia Hulubei' in Magurele, Romania considered a similar scheme, using the specialized TK-5 train transiting Ukraine to the destination point in the Russian Federation, or, as an alternative, using the means and route of the spent nuclear fuel periodically shipped from the Bulgarian nuclear power plant Kosloduy (by barge on the Danube, and by train through Ukraine to the Russian Federation). Due to impossibility to reach an agreement in due time with the transit country, in February 2007 the US, Russian and Romanian project partners decided to adopt the air shipment of the spent nuclear fuel as prime option, eliminating the need for agreements with any transit countries. By this time the spent nuclear fuel inspections were completed, proving the compliance of the burn-up parameters with the international requirements for air shipments of radioactive materials. The short air route avoiding overflying of any other countries except the country of origin and the country of destination also contributed to the decision making in this issue. The efficient project management and cooperation between the three countries (Russia, Romania and USA) made possible, after two and a half years of preparation work, for the first fully certified spent nuclear fuel air shipment to take place on 29th of June 2009, from Romanian airport 'Henri Coanda' to the Russian airport 'Koltsovo' near Yekaterinburg. One day before that, after a record period of 3 weeks of preparation, another HEU cargo was shipped by air from Romanian Institute for Nuclear Research in Pitesti to Russia, containing fresh pellets and therefore making Romania the third HEU-free country in the RRRFR program.","","","Idaho National Lab.

A key element of the strategies is to use nuclear reactors for further irradiation of recovered chemical elements to transmute certain long-lived highly-radioactive isotopes into less hazardous isotopes. Both thermal and fast neutron spectrum reactors are being studied as part of integrated nuclear energy systems where separations, transmutation, and disposal are considered. Radiotoxicity is being used as one of the metrics for estimating the hazard of used fuel and the processing of wastes resulting from separations and recycle-fuel fabrication. Decay heat from the used fuel and/or wastes destined for disposal is used as a metric for use of a geologic repository. Results to date indicate that the most promising options appear to be those using fast reactors in a repeated recycle mode to limit buildup of higher actinides, since the transuranic elements are a key contributor to the radiotoxicity and decay heat. Using such an approach, there could be much lower environmental impact from the high-level waste as compared to direct disposal of the used fuel, but there would likely be greater generation of low-level wastes that will also require disposal. An additional potential waste management benefit is having the ability to tailor waste forms and contents to one or more targeted disposal environments (i.e., to be able to put waste in environments best-suited for the waste contents and forms).","","","Idaho National Lab.

The TALSPEAK process (Trivalent Actinide Lanthanide Separations by Phosphorus-reagent Extraction from Aqueous Komplexes) is a prime example of these separation processes. The objective of this paper is to explore the use of ionic liquids (ILs) for the TALSPEAK-like process, to further enhance its extraction efficiencies for lanthanides, and to investigate the potential of using this modified TALSPEAK process for separation of lanthanides among themselves. Eight imidazolium ILs ([Cnmim][NTf2] and [Cnmim][BETI], n=4,6,8,10) and one pyrrolidinium IL ([C4mPy][NTf2]) were investigated as diluents using di(2-ethylhexyl)phosphoric acid (HDEHP) as an extractant for separation of lanthanide ions from aqueous solutions of 50 mM glycolic acid or citric acid and 5 mM diethylenetriamine pentaacetic acid (DTPA). The extraction efficiencies were studied in comparison with diisopropylbenzene (DIPB), an organic solvent used as diluent for the conventional TALSPEAK extraction system. Excellent extraction efficiencies and selectivities were found for a number of lanthanide ions using HDEHP as an extractant in these ILs. The effects of different alkyl chain lengths in the cations of ILs and anions on extraction efficiencies and selectivities of lanthanide ions are also presented in this paper.","","","Oak Ridge National Lab.

This stream is generated during reprocessing of light-water-reactor spent fuel to recycle the actinides and separate fission products for waste disposal. U and Tc are co-extracted from a nitric acid solution using tri-n-butylphosphate in dodecane, so that Tc(VII) is present in the strip solution after the actinide separations. The goal is to separate uranyl from the pertechnetate in this U-Tc stream and then sequester Tc in the metallic form. Our approach is based on reductive stripping of pertechnetate either from aqueous solution (for column extractions) or organic solvents (for liquid-liquid extractions). In both of these methods, metallic zinc in the presence of formic acid serves as a reducing agent, and {sup 99}Tc is recovered as a co-precipitate of Zn(II) hydroxide and hydrous Tc(IV) oxide, with a Zn:Tc ratio between 1:1 and 2:1 mol/mol. This solid residue can be reduced to a Zn-Tc alloy by high temperature (500-700 C) hydrogenation, and the resulting heterophase alloy can be added to a metallic Fe-Zr-Mo waste form that is processed at 1600 C, with subsequent loss of Zn by evaporation. Alternatively, Zn and Tc can be separated and {sup 99}Tc sequestered as NH{sub 4}TcO{sub 4} for further reduction to Tc(0) metal. The aqueous Zn reduction process removes {approx}90% of {sup 99}Tc per cycle. The nonaqueous Zn reduction in 1:1 methanol-formic acid removes 60-70% of {sup 99}Tc per cycle, depending on the extracting agent (such as a tetraalkylammonium nitrate). The extracting agent is recycled in the process. The pertechnetate is extracted from the aqueous phase into 1,2-dichloroethane, which is removed by evaporation and reused. The residue is either calcined and steam reformed to Tc(0) or processed by the nonaqueous Zn reduction method. These methods can be used not only to remove the pertechnetate from the U-Tc product stream, but also to sequester the pertechnetate from aqueous waste streams generated through the processes described in this paper, thereby closing the cycle. The same approaches can be used to close the {sup 99}Tc cycle for other methods that are currently being developed at Los Alamos and Argonne National Laboratories.","","","Argonne National Lab.

"O and H diffusion in uraninite: Implications for fluid-uraninite interactions, nuclear waste disposal, and nuclear forensics","Fayek, Mostafa; Anovitz, Lawrence {Larry} M; Cole, David; Bostick, Debra A","11 NUCLEAR FUEL CYCLE AND FUEL MATERIALS; 08 HYDROGEN; 12 MANAGEMENT OF RADIOACTIVE WASTES, AND NON-RADIOACTIVE WASTES FROM NUCLEAR FACILITIES; ATOMS; CHEMICAL COMPOSITION; CLAYS; DEFECTS; DIFFUSION; FISSILE MATERIALS; FRACTIONATION; GROUND WATER; HYDROGEN; INTERSTITIALS; ISOTOPIC EXCHANGE; MINERALIZATION; NUCLEAR FUELS; OXYGEN; RADIOACTIVE WASTES; SILICATE MINERALS; TEXTURE; URANINITES; URANIUM; URANIUM DEPOSITS; VACANCIES","Diffusion coefficients for oxygen and hydrogen were determined from a series of natural uraninite H2O experiments between 50 and 700 C. Under hydrous conditions there are two diffusion mechanisms: (1) an initial extremely fast-path diffusion mechanism that overprinted the oxygen isotopic composition of the entire crystals regardless of temperature and (2) a slower volume-diffusive mechanism dominated by defect clusters that displace or eject nearest neighbor oxygen atoms to form two interstitial sites and two partial vacancies, and by vacancy migration. Using the volume diffusion coefficients in the temperature range of 400 600 C, diffusion coefficients for oxygen can be represented by D = 1.90e5 exp (123,382 J/RT) cm2/s and for temperatures between 100 and 300 C the diffusion coefficients can be represented by D = 1.95e10 exp (62484 J/ RT) cm2/s, where the activation energies for uraninite are 123.4 and 62.5 kJ/mol, respectively. Hydrogen diffusion in uraninite appears to be controlled by similar mechanisms as oxygen. Using the volume diffusion coefficients for temperatures between 50 and 700 C, diffusion coefficients for hydrogen can be represented by D = 9.28e6 exp (156,528 J/RT) cm2/s for temperatures between 450 and 700 C and D = 1.39e14 exp (34518 J/RT) cm2/s for temperatures between 50 and 400 C, where the activation energies for uraninite are 156.5 and 34.5 kJ/mol, respectively. Results from these new experiments have implications for isotopic exchange during natural UO2 water interactions. The exceptionally low d18O values of natural uraninites (i.e. 32& to 19.5&) from unconformity-type uranium deposits in Saskatchewan, in conjunction with theoretical and experimental uraninite water and UO3 water fractionation factors, suggest that primary uranium mineralization is not in oxygen isotopic equilibrium with coeval clay and silicate minerals. The low d18O values have been interpreted as resulting from the low temperature overprinting of primary uranium mineralization in the presence of relatively modern meteoric fluids having d18O values of ca. 18&, despite petrographic and U Pb isotope data that indicate limited alteration. Our data show that the anomalously low oxygen isotopic composition of the uraninite from the Athabasca Basin can be due to meteoric water overprinting under reducing conditions, and meteoric water or groundwater can significantly affect the oxygen isotopic composition of spent nuclear fuel in a geologic repository, with minimal change to the chemical composition or texture. Moreover, the rather fast oxygen and hydrogen diffusion coefficients for uraninite, especially at low temperatures, suggest that oxygen and hydrogen diffusion may impart characteristic isotopic signals that can be used to track the route of fissile material.","","","Oak Ridge National Lab.

During reactor operations or nuclear fuel reprocessing these ruthenium isotopes may be present as ruthenium tetroxide (RuO4) vapor, a highly mobile form of ruthenium that has been involved in a number of cases of accidental exposure to 106Ru or 103Ru. This paper summarizes the biokinetic database for ruthenium and proposes a new respiratory model for inhaled RuO4 vapor, a new biokinetic for systemic (absorbed) ruthenium, and material-specific gastrointestinal absorption fractions for ruthenium. The proposed respiratory model for RuO4 differs from the current ICRP model mainly in that it depicts slower clearance of deposited activity from the respiratory tract and lower absorption to blood than depicted in the current ICRP model. The proposed systemic biokinetic model depicts more realistic paths of movement of absorbed ruthenium in the body than the current ICRP model and, in contrast to the present model, a less uniform distribution of systemic activity. Implications of the proposed models with regard to inhalation and ingestion dose coefficients for 106Ru are examined.","","","Oak Ridge National Lab.

On the other hand, KENO-VI allows very complex geometric modeling. Both KENO codes can utilize either continuous-energy or multigroup cross-section data and have been thoroughly verified and validated with ENDF libraries through ENDF/B-VII.0, which has been first distributed with SCALE 6.

"Radioactive Waste Partitioning and Transmutation within Advanced Fuel Cycles: Achievements and Challenges","Salvatores, M; Palmiotti, G","11 NUCLEAR FUEL CYCLE AND FUEL MATERIALS; Nuclear Reactor, Partitioning, Transmutation, Adva","If nuclear power should become a sustainable source of energy, a safe, robust and acceptable solution must be pursued for existing and projected inventories of high-activity, long-lived radioactive waste. Remarkable progress in the last two decades has been made in the field of geological disposal. Some countries have reached important milestones and geological disposal (of spent fuel) is expected to start in 2020 in Finland and in 2022 in Sweden and in fact the licensing of the geological repositories in both countries is now entering into their final phases. In France disposal of Intermediate Level Wastes (ILW) and vitrified High Level Wastes (HLW) is expected to start around 2025, according to the roadmap defined by a Parliament Act in 2006. In this context, transmutation of part of the waste through use of advanced fuel cycles, probably feasible in the coming decades, has the potential of reducing the burden on the geological repository. This article presents the physical principle of transmutation and reviews several strategies of P&T (Partitioning and Transmutation). Many recent studies have demonstrated that the impact of P&T on geological disposal concepts is not overwhelmingly high. However, by reducing waste heat production a more efficient utilization of repository space is likely. Moreover, even if radionuclide release from the waste to the environment and related calculated doses to the population are only partially reduced by P&T, it is important to point out that a clear reduction of the actinide inventory in the High Level Waste definitely reduces risks arising from less probable evolutions of a repository, i.e. increase of actinide mobility in certain geochemical situations and radiological impact by human intrusion.","","","Idaho National Lab.

In this paper QUADRISO particles are proposed to manage the initial excess reactivity of high temperature reactors. The QUADRISO concept synergistically couples the decrease of the burnable poison with the decrease of the fissile materials at the fuel particle level. This mechanism is set up by introducing a burnable poison layer around the fuel kernel in ordinary TRISO particles or by mixing the burnable poison with any of the TRISO coated layers. At the beginning of life, the initial excess reactivity is small because some neutrons are absorbed in the burnable poison and they are prevented from entering the fuel kernel. At the end of life, when the absorber is almost depleted, more neutrons stream into the fuel kernel of QUADRISO particles causing fission reactions. The mechanism has been applied to a prismatic high temperature reactor with europium or erbium burnable absorbers, showing a significant reduction in the initial excess reactivity of the core.","","","Argonne National Lab.

When released into the environment, large quantities of these radionuclides can present considerable problems to man and biota due to their radioactive nature and, in some cases as with the actinides, their chemical toxicity. Radionuclides are expected to decay at a known rate. Yet, research has shown the rate of elimination from an ecosystem to differ from the decay rate due to physical, chemical and biological processes that remove the contaminant or reduce its biological availability. Knowledge regarding the rate by which a contaminant is eliminated from an ecosystem (ecological half-life) is important for evaluating the duration and potential severity of risk. To better understand a contaminants impact on an environment, consideration should be given to plants. As primary producers, they represent an important mode of contamination transfer from sediments and soils into the food chain. Contaminants that are chemically and/or physically sequestered in a media are less likely to be bio-available to plants and therefore an ecosystem.","","available","Savannah River Site (SRS), Aiken, SC (United States)","USDOE","","United States","2010-12-16T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: Journal of Environmental Monitoring","","Medium: ED","","WSRC-TR-2011-DB06","DE-AC09-08SR22470","Journal ID: ISSN 1464-0325; TRN: US1104548","","","2014-10-10T00:00:00Z","1023447","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/1023447","https://www.osti.gov/servlets/purl/1023447","Journal of Environmental Monitoring","",""

The report was prepared in support of providing data for preparation of a NEPA Environmental Impact Statement in support the U. S. Department of Energy (DOE) Global Nuclear Energy Partnership (GNEP). One of the GNEP objectives was to reduce the inventory of long lived actinide from the light water reactor (LWR) spent fuel. The LWR spent fuel contains Plutonium (Pu) -239 and other transuranics (TRU) such as Americium-241. One of the options is to transmute or burn these actinides in fast neutron spectra as well as generate the electricity. A sodium-cooled Advanced Recycling Reactor (ARR) concept was proposed to achieve this goal. However, fuel with relatively high TRU content has not been used in the fast reactor. To demonstrate the utilization of TRU fuel in a fast reactor, an Advanced Burner Reactor (ABR) prototype of ARR was proposed, which would necessarily be started up using weapons grade (WG) Pu fuel. The WG Pu is distinguished by relatively highest proportions of Pu-239 and lesser amount of other actinides. The WG Pu was assumed to be used as the startup fuel along with TRU fuel in lead test assemblies. Because such fuel is not currently being produced in the US, a new facility (or new capability in an existing facility) was being considered for fabrication of WG Pu fuel for the ABR. It was estimated that the facility will provide the startup fuel for 10-15 years and would take 3 to 5 years to construct.","","","Idaho National Lab.

One such application involves U–Zr as nuclear fuel, where radiation damage and diffusion (processes heavily dependent on point defects) are of vital importance. Several systems of U are examined within a density functional theory framework utilizing projector augmented wave pseudopotentials. Two separate generalized gradient approximations of the exchange-correlation are used to calculate defect properties and are compared. The bulk modulus, the lattice constant, and the Birch–Murnaghan equation of state for the defect free bcc uranium allotrope are calculated. Defect parameters calculated include energies of formation of vacancies in the a and ? allotropes, as well as self-interstitials, Zr interstitials, and Zr substitutional defects for the ? allotrope. The results for vacancies agree very well with experimental and previous computational studies. The most probable self-interstitial site in ?-U is the 110 dumbbell, and the most probable defect location for dilute Zr in ?-U is the substitutional site. This is the first detailed study of self-defects in the bcc allotrope of U and also the first comprehensive study of dilute Zr defects in ?-U.","","","Idaho National Lab.

However, the nuclear fuel cycle in the United States today is unsustainable. As stated in the 1982 Nuclear Waste Policy Act, the U.S. Department of Energy is responsible for disposing of spent nuclear fuel generated by commercial nuclear power plants operating in a “once-through” fuel cycle in the deep geologic repository located at Yucca Mountain. However, unyielding political opposition to the site has hindered the commissioning process to the extant that the current administration has recently declared the unsuitability of the Yucca Mountain site. In light of this the DOE is exploring other options, including closing the fuel cycle through recycling and reprocessing of spent nuclear fuel. The possibility of closing the fuel cycle is receiving special attention because of its ability to minimize the final high level waste (HLW) package as well as recover additional energy value from the original fuel. The technology is, however, still very controversial because of the increased cost and proliferation risk it can present. To lend perspective on the closed fuel cycle alternative, this presents the arguments for and against closing the fuel cycle with respect to sustainability, proliferation risk, commercial viability, waste management, and energy security.","","","Pacific Northwest National Lab.

"Computational Fluid Dynamics Analysis of Very High Temperature Gas-Cooled Reactor Cavity Cooling System","Frisani, Angelo; Hassan, Yassin A; Ugaz, Victor M","11 NUCLEAR FUEL CYCLE AND FUEL MATERIALS","The design of passive heat removal systems is one of the main concerns for the modular very high temperature gas-cooled reactors (VHTR) vessel cavity. The reactor cavity cooling system (RCCS) is a key heat removal system during normal and off-normal conditions. The design and validation of the RCCS is necessary to demonstrate that VHTRs can survive to the postulated accidents. The computational fluid dynamics (CFD) STAR-CCM+/V3.06.006 code was used for three-dimensional system modeling and analysis of the RCCS. A CFD model was developed to analyze heat exchange in the RCCS. The model incorporates a 180-deg section resembling the VHTR RCCS experimentally reproduced in a laboratory-scale test facility at Texas A&M University. All the key features of the experimental facility were taken into account during the numerical simulations. The objective of the present work was to benchmark CFD tools against experimental data addressing the behavior of the RCCS following accident conditions. Two cooling fluids (i.e., water and air) were considered to test the capability of maintaining the RCCS concrete walls' temperature below design limits. Different temperature profiles at the reactor pressure vessel (RPV) wall obtained from the experimental facility were used as boundary conditions in the numerical analyses to simulate VHTR transient evolution during accident scenarios. Mesh convergence was achieved with an intensive parametric study of the two different cooling configurations and selected boundary conditions. To test the effect of turbulence modeling on the RCCS heat exchange, predictions using several different turbulence models and near-wall treatments were evaluated and compared. The comparison among the different turbulence models analyzed showed satisfactory agreement for the temperature distribution inside the RCCS cavity medium and at the standpipes walls. For such a complicated geometry and flow conditions, the tested turbulence models demonstrated that the realizable k-epsilon model with two-layer all y+ wall treatment performs better than the other k-epsilon and k-omega turbulence models when compared to the experimental results and the Reynolds stress transport turbulence model results. A scaling analysis was developed to address the distortions introduced by the CFD model in simulating the physical phenomena inside the RCCS system with respect to the full plant configuration. The scaling analysis demonstrated that both the experimental facility and the CFD model achieve a satisfactory resemblance of the main flow characteristics inside the RCCS cavity region, and convection and radiation heat exchange phenomena are properly scaled from the actual plant.","","http://epubs.ans.org/?a=13299","Texas A & M Univ., College Station, TX (United States).

"Nuclear Islands: International Leasing of Nuclear Fuel Cycle Sites to Provide Enduring Assurance of Peaceful Use","Paine, Christopher E.; Cochran, Thomas B.","11 NUCLEAR FUEL CYCLE AND FUEL MATERIALS; Nuclear fuel cycle; nuclear energy; international controls; highly enriched uranium","Current International Atomic Energy Agency safeguards do not provide adequate protection against the diversion to military use of materials or technology from certain types of sensitive nuclear fuel cycle facilities. In view of highly enriched uranium’s relatively greater ease of use as a nuclear explosive material than plutonium and the significant diseconomies of commercial spent fuel reprocessing, this article focuses on the need for improved international controls over uranium enrichment facilities as the proximate justification for creation of an International Nuclear Fuel Cycle Association (INFCA). In principle, the proposal is equally applicable to alleviating the proliferation concerns provoked by nuclear fuel reprocessing plants and other sensitive nuclear fuel cycle facilities. The INFCA would provide significantly increased nonproliferation assurance to its member states and the wider international community by holding long-term leasehold contracts to operate secure restricted zones containing such sensitive nuclear facilities.","Natural Resources Defense Council","","USDOE Office of Nuclear Energy (NE)","USDOE","","United States","2010-11-01T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: Nonproliferation Review; Journal Volume: 17; Journal Issue: 3","","Medium: X; Size: p 441-446","","","","Journal ID: ISSN 1073-6700","10.1080/10736700.2010.516996","","2016-06-20T00:00:00Z","1133919","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/1133919","","Nonproliferation Review","3","17"

The idea is to hybridize an implicit and an explicit discretization in a nonlinearly consis- tent way in order to achieve second order time convergent calculations. In this scope, the hydrodynamics equations are discretized explicitly making use of the capability of well- understood explicit schemes. On the other hand , the radiation diffusion part is solved implicitly. In the view of the non-linearly consistent IMEX method, the hydrodynamics equations are solved as part of the non-linear function evaluation within the framework of the Jacobian-Free Newton Krylov (JFNK) method [16,14]. This is to avoid order reductions in time convergence due to the operator splitting. We present results from several test prob- lems in order to validate the numerical order of the scheme.

Four different binder and two different CeO2 powder sources were investigated. The strength of the isostatically pressed pellets for all binder systems measured by diametral compression was about 50% higher than pellets produced by uniaxial dry pressing at the same pressure. It was proposed that the less uniform density of uniaxially pressed pellets accounted for the lower strength. The strength of pellets containing CeO2 powder with significantly higher moisture content was five times higher than pellets containing CeO2 powder with a low moisture content. Capillary pressure of the moisture was thought to supply the added binding strength.","","","Idaho National Lab.

Monolithic fuel design provides higher uranium loading than that of the traditional dispersion fuel design. Hot isostatic pressing is a promising process for low-cost batch fabrication of monolithic RERTR fuel plates for these high-power reactors. Bonding U Mo fuel foil and 6061 Al cladding by hot isostatic press bonding was successfully developed at Idaho National Laboratory. Due to the relatively high processing temperature, the interaction between fuel meat and aluminum cladding is a concern. Two different methods were employed to mitigate this effect: (1) a diffusion barrier and (2) a doping addition to the interface. Both types of fuel plates have been fabricated by hot isostatic press bonding. Preliminary results show that the direct fuel/cladding interaction during the bonding process was eliminated by introducing a thin zirconium diffusion barrier layer between the fuel and the cladding. Fuel plates were also produced and characterized with a silicon-rich interlayer between fuel and cladding. This paper reports the recent progress of this developmental effort and identifies the areas that need further attention.","","","Idaho National Lab.

This is accomplished by absorbing radioactive salts into zeolite, mixing with glass frit, heating to a molten state 915 C to form a sodalite glass matrix, and solidifying for long-term storage. Less long term leaching is expected if the solidifying cooling rate doesn’t cause cracking. In addition to thermal stress, this paper proposes that a stress is formed during solidification which is very large for fast cooling rates during solidification and can cause severe cracking. A solidifying glass or ceramic cylinder forms a dome on the cylinder top end. The temperature distribution at the time of solidification causes the stress and the dome. The dome height, “the length deficit,” produces an axial stress when the solid returns to room temperature with the inherent outer region in compression, the inner in tension. Large tensions will cause cracking of the specimen. The temperature deficit, derived by dividing the length deficit by the coefficient of thermal expansion, allows solidification stress theory to be extended to the circumferential stress. This paper derives the solidification stress theory, gives examples, explains how to induce beneficial stresses, and compares theory to experimental data.","","","Idaho National Lab.

To this end, a U–7 wt.% Mo alloy research reactor dispersion fuel plate with Al–2 wt.% Si matrix was destructively examined using scanning and transmission electron microscopy to characterize the developed microstructure after fabrication. Of particular interest for this study was how the Si that was added to the fuel matrix partitioned between the various fuel plate phases during fabrication. Si was added to the matrix so that the microstructure that developed during fuel fabrication would exhibit good irradiation behavior. SEM analysis was used to identify the representative microstructure, the compositions of the various phases, and the partitioning behavior of the fuel and matrix constituents. TEM analysis was employed to definitively identify the phases in the U–7Mo alloy and the phases that formed due to diffusional interactions between the fuel particles and matrix during fuel plate fabrication. The TEM results are the first reported for an as-fabricated U–7 wt.% Mo dispersion fuel plate with an Al alloy matrix. SEM results showed that a significant portion of the original ?-(U–Mo) fuel particles had transformed to a lamellar microstructure, comprised of a-U and either ? or ?' phases, and the fuel/matrix interaction layers were enriched in Si. TEM analysis identified an ordered fcc (U–Mo)(Al–Si)3 type of phase, which formed at the decomposed U–7Mo/matrix interface and extended into the lamellar microstructure. Some regions of the U–7Mo particles retained the single-phase ?-(U–Mo). Small precipitate phases were observed in the fuel meat matrix that contained Fe, Al, and Si. The Si that is added to the matrix of a U–Mo dispersion fuel plate to improve irradiation performance appears to result in the creation of a Si-rich (U–Mo)(Al–Si)3 type of fuel/matrix interaction layer during fabrication that appears to exhibit favorable behavior during irradiation compared to the behavior of the layers that form in U–Mo dispersion fuel plates without Si in the matrix.","","","Idaho National Lab.

While current approaches to safeguarding and protecting the nuclear fuel cycle have been very successful, there is significant, active interest to further improve the efficiency and effectiveness of safeguards and security, particularly in light of the anticipated growth of nuclear energy and the increase in the global threat environment. This article will address two recent developments called Safeguards-by-Design and Security-by-Design, which are receiving increasing broad international attention and support. Expected benefits include facilities that are inherently more economical to effectively safeguard and protect. However, the technical measures of safeguards and security alone are not enough - they must continue to be broadly supported by dynamic and adaptive nonproliferation and security regimes. To this end, at the level of the global fuel cycle architecture, 'nonproliferation and security by design' remains a worthy objective that is also the subject of very active, international focus.","","","Idaho National Lab.

For every ton of enriched uranium fuel (3% 235U) that is consumed at a typical burn-up rate, nearly 1 kg of 99Tc is generated. Thus, the mass of 99Tc produced since 1993 has nearly quadrupled, and the pace of generation will likely increase if more emphasis is placed on nuclear power to slow the accumulation of atmospheric greenhouse gases. In order to gain a comprehensive understanding of the interaction of 99Tc and the natural environment, we review the sources of 99Tc in the nuclear fuel cycle and its biogeochemical behavior. We include an evaluation of the use of Re as a chemical analog of Tc, as well as a summary of the redox potential, sorption, colloidal behavior, and interaction of humic substances with Tc, and the potential for re-oxidation and remobilization of Tc(IV). What emerges is a more complicated picture of Tc behavior than that of an easily tractable transition of Tc(VII) to Tc(IV) with consequent immobilization. Reducing conditions (+200 to +100 mV Eh) and the presence of Fe(II) sorbed onto Fe(III) (oxy)hydroxides will bring the mobile Tc(VII) species to a lower oxidation state and will form the relatively insoluble Tc(IV)O2∙nH2O, but even as a solid, equilibrium concentrations of aqueous Tc are nearly a factor of 20× above the EPA set drinking water standards. However, sequestration of Tc(IV) into Fe(III)-bearing phases, such as goethite, iron-bearing phyllosilicates and, perhaps, siderite, may ameliorate concerns over the mobility of Tc. A key factor, elucidated through experiment, in retarding the mobility of Tc in the environment is isolation from exposure to oxygen, which occurs when Tc is in a crystallographic position in a solid phase.","","","Pacific Northwest National Lab.

The thermochemistry of lactate protonation, when studied directly in 1.0 M sodium lactate, agreed well with the studies performed in trifluoromethanesulfonate (triflate). This thermodynamic agreement suggests that the physical chemistry of lactate in the solutions applicable to the TALSPEAK process – a solvent extraction method for separating trivalent actinides from trivalent lanthanides within the scope of used nuclear fuel processing efforts – may be simulated in triflate solutions. Potentiometry, spectrophotometry and microcalorimetry have been subsequently used to study the thermodynamic features of neodymium and americium complexation by lactate using triflate as a strong background electrolyte. Three successive mononuclear lactate complexes were identified for Nd(III) and Am(III). The stability constants for neodymium, log ß1 = 2.60 ± 0.01, log ß2 = 4.66 ± 0.02 and log ß3 = 5.6 ± 0.1, and for americium, log ß1 = 2.60 ± 0.06, log ß2 = 4.7 ± 0.1 and log ß3 = 6.2 ± 0.2, were found to closely agree with the thermodynamic studies reported in sodium perchlorate solutions. Consequently, the thermodynamic medium effect, imposed on the TALSPEAK-related solution equilibria by the presence of strong background electrolytes such as NaClO4 and NaNO3, do not significantly impact the speciation in solution.","","","Idaho National Lab.

"DECONTAMINATION OF ZIRCALOY CLADDING HULLS FROM SPENT NUCLEAR FUEL","Rudisill, T","11 NUCLEAR FUEL CYCLE AND FUEL MATERIALS; 36 MATERIALS SCIENCE; ACTINIDES; ACTIVITY LEVELS; ADSORPTION; CLASSIFICATION; CONTAMINATION; DECONTAMINATION; DISSOLUTION; EUROPE; FISSION PRODUCTS; HYDROFLUORIC ACID; IRRADIATION; JAPAN; NEUTRONS; NUCLEAR FUELS; OXIDES; RADIOACTIVE MATERIALS; REMOVAL; REPROCESSING; SPENT FUELS; WASTES; ZIRCALOY","The feasibility of decontaminating spent fuel cladding hulls using hydrofluoric acid (HF) was investigated as part of the Global Energy Nuclear Partnership (GNEP) Separations Campaign. The concentrations of the fission product and transuranic (TRU) isotopes in the decontaminated hulls were compared to the limits for determining the low level waste (LLW) classification in the United States (US). The {sup 90}Sr and {sup 137}Cs concentrations met the disposal criteria for a Class C LLW; although, in a number of experiments the criteria for disposal as a Class B LLW were met. The TRU concentration in the hulls generally exceeded the Class C LLW limit by at least an order of magnitude. The concentration decreased sharply as the initial 30-40 {micro}m of the cladding hull surface were removed. At depths beyond this point, the TRU activity remained relatively constant, well above the Class C limit. Reprocessing of spent nuclear fuel generates a cladding waste which would likely require disposal as a Greater than Class C LLW in the US. If the cladding hulls could be treated to remove a majority of the actinide and fission product contamination, the hulls could potentially meet acceptance criteria for disposal as a LLW or allow recycle of the Zr metal. Discard of the hulls as a LLW would result in significant cost savings compared to disposal as a Greater than Class C waste which currently has no disposition path. During fuel irradiation and reprocessing, radioactive materials are produced and deposited in the Zircaloy cladding. Due to short depths of penetration, the majority of the fission products and actinide elements are located in the ZrO{sub 2} layer which forms on the surface of the cladding during fuel irradiation. Therefore, if the oxide layer is removed, the majority of the contamination should also be removed. It is very difficult, if not impossible to remove all of the activity from spent fuel cladding since traces of U and Th in the unirradiated Zircaloy adsorb neutrons generating higher actinides in the bulk material. During fuel irradiation, {sup 92}Zr is also converted to radioactive {sup 93}Zr by neutron adsorption. Methods for decontaminating and conditioning irradiated Zircaloy cladding hulls have been investigated in Europe, Japan, and the US during the last 35 years; however, a method to decontaminate the hulls to an activity level which meets US acceptance criteria for disposal as a LLW was not deployed on a commercial scale. The feasibility of decontaminating spent fuel cladding hulls was investigated as part of the GNEP Separations Campaign. Small-scale experiments were used to demonstrate the removal of the ZrO{sub 2} layer from Zircaloy coupons using dilute solutions ({le}1.0 M) of HF. The most effective conditions resulted in dissolution rates which were less than approximately 2 mg/cm{sup 2}-min. With dissolution rates in this range, uniform removal of the oxide layer was obtained and a minimal amount of Zircaloy metal was dissolved. To test the HF decontamination process, experiments were subsequently performed using actual spent fuel cladding hulls. Decontamination experiments were performed to measure the fission product and actinide concentrations as a function of the depth of the surface removed from the cladding hull. The experimental methods used to perform these experiments and a discussion of the results and observations are presented in the following sections.","","available","Savannah River Site (SRS), Aiken, SC (United States)","USDOE","","United States","2010-09-29T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: Journal of Nuclear Materials","","Medium: ED","","WSRC-STI-2008-00075","DE-AC09-08SR22470","Journal ID: ISSN 0022-3115; JNUMAM; TRN: US1007521","","","2010-11-18T00:00:00Z","991627","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/991627","https://www.osti.gov/servlets/purl/991627","Journal of Nuclear Materials","",""

The model, originally developed from column experiment data, included distributed-rate surface complexation kinetics of U(VI), aqueous speciation, and physical non-equilibrium transport processes. A rigorous parameter sensitivity analysis was carried out with respect to different state variables: concentrations, mass fluxes, total mass and spatial moments of dissolved U(VI) for laboratory systems, and various simulation scenarios that represented the field-scale characteristics at the Hanford 300A site. The field-scenarios accounted for transient groundwater flow and variable geochemical conditions driven by frequent water level changes of the nearby Columbia River. Simulations indicated that the transient conditions significantly affected U(VI) plume migration at the site. The parameter sensitivities were largely similar between the laboratory and field scale systems. Where differences existed, they were shown to result from differing degrees of U(VI) adsorption disequilibrium caused by hydraulic or hydrogeochemical conditions. Adorption disequilibrium was found to differ (i) between short duration peak flow events at the field scale and much longer flow events in the laboratory, (ii) for changing groundwater chemical compositions due to river water intrusion, and (iii) for different sampling locations at the field scale. Parameter sensitivities were also found to vary with respect to the different investigated state variables. An approach is demonstrated that elucidates the most important parameters of a laboratory-scale model that must constrained in both the laboratory and field for meaningful field application.","","","Pacific Northwest National Lab.

Three-dimensional flow distributions of sodium for several fast reactor fuel assembly pin spacing configurations were simulated on high performance computers using commercial CFD software. This research focused on 19-pin fuel assembly “benchmark” geometry, similar in design to the Advanced Burner Test Reactor, where each pin is separated by helical wire-wrap spacers. Several two-equation turbulence models including the k–e and SST (Menter) k–? were evaluated. Considerable effort was taken to resolve the momentum boundary layer, so as to eliminate the need for wall functions and reduce computational uncertainty. High performance computers were required to generate the hybrid meshes needed to predict secondary flows created by the wire-wrap spacers; computational meshes ranging from 65 to 85 million elements were common. A general validation methodology was followed, including mesh refinement and comparison of numerical results with empirical correlations.

First, it is verified that the system is based solely on cation exchange between H+ and Cs+ and that NO3- does not intervene, i.e., that the apparent nitrate dependency is merely an artifact of solution non-idealities. Next, the enthalpy and entropy of the system were determined using appropriate corrections in the van’t Hoff analysis and are in excellent agreement with independently published calorimetry results. Finally, the extraction of Cs by the system containing both HCCD and polyethylene glycol (PEG) in FS-13 was characterized by the determination the species produced in the organic and aqueous phases and it is further demonstrated that synergistic extraction of Cs by HCCD and PEG does not occur. Although there is a definite interaction between HCCD and PEG, and it is well established that this interaction is responsible for the extraction of Sr, this association is actually antagonist with respect to the extraction of Cs.","","","Idaho National Lab.

We report a model for determining the density of the molten salt. Inventory operations account for the net mass of salt and for the mass of actinides present. It was necessary to know the molten salt density but difficult to measure, and it was decided to model the salt density for the initial treatment operations. The model assumes that volumes are additive for the ideal molten salt solution as a starting point; subsequently a correction factor for the lanthanides and actinides was developed. After applying the correction factor, the percent difference between the net salt mass in the electrorefiner and the resulting modeled salt mass decreased from more than 4.0% to approximately 0.1%. As a result, there is no need to measure the salt density at 500 C for inventory operations; the model for the salt density is found to be accurate.","","","Idaho National Lab.

The experiments involved crushing spent LWR fuel to particulate and separating it from its cladding. Oxide fuel particulate was then converted to metal in a series of six electrolytic reduction runs that were performed in succession with a single salt loading of molten LiCl – 1 wt% Li2O at 650 °C. Analysis of salt samples following the series of electrolytic reduction runs identified the diffusion of select fission products from the spent fuel to the molten salt electrolyte. The extents of metal oxide conversion in the post-test fuel were also quantified, including a nominal 99.7% conversion of uranium oxide to metal. Uranium metal was then separated from the reduced LWR fuel in a series of six electrorefining runs that were performed in succession with a single salt loading of molten LiCl-KCl-UCl3 at 500 °C. Analysis of salt samples following the series of electrorefining runs identified additional partitioning of fission products into the molten salt electrolyte. Analyses of the separated uranium metal were performed, and its decontamination factors were determined.","","","Idaho National Lab.

The Department of Energy (DOE) has selected the HTGR concept for the Next Generation Nuclear Plant (NGNP) Project as a transformative application of nuclear energy that will demonstrate emissions-free nuclear-assisted electricity, process heat, and hydrogen production, thereby reducing greenhouse-gas emissions and enhancing energy security. The objective of the DOE Advanced Gas Reactor (AGR) Fuel Development and Qualification program is to qualify tristructural isotropic (TRISO)-coated particle fuel for use in HTGRs. The Advanced Gas Reactor Fuel Development and Qualification Program consists of five elements: fuel manufacture, fuel and materials irradiations, post-irradiation examination (PIE) and safety testing, fuel performance modeling, and fission-product transport and source term evaluation. An underlying theme for the fuel development work is the need to develop a more complete, fundamental understanding of the relationship between the fuel fabrication process and key fuel properties, the irradiation and accident safety performance of the fuel, and the release and transport of fission products in the NGNP primary coolant system. An overview of the program and recent progress is presented.","","","Idaho National Lab.

This work considers transport of three 5-year-cooled oxide Advanced Burner Reactor used fuel assemblies with a burn-up of 160 MWD/kg. A transport cask designed to carry these assemblies is proposed. This design employs a 7-cm-thick lead gamma shield and a 20-cm-thick NS-4-FR composite neutron shield. The temperature profile within the cask, from its center to its exterior surface, is determined by two dimensional computational fluid dynamics simulations of conduction, convection, and radiation within the cask. Simulations are performed for a cask with a smooth external surface and various neutron shield thicknesses. Separate simulations are performed for a cask with a corrugated external surface and a neutron shield thickness that satisfies shielding constraints. Resulting temperature profiles indicate that a three-assembly cask with a smooth external surface will meet fuel cladding temperature requirements but will cause outer surface temperatures to exceed the regulatory limit. A cask with a corrugated external surface will not exceed the limits for both the fuel cladding and outer surface temperatures.","","","Idaho National Lab.

However, the high water-to-binder ratios, which are required to meet the desired workability and injection ability at early age, lead to high porosity that may affect the durability of this material and undermine its long-term geochemical performance. In this paper, a new methodology is presented in order to help the process of mix design which best meets the compromise between these two conflicting requirements. It involves the combined use of the computer programs CEMHYD3D for the generation of digital-image-based microstructures and CrunchFlow, for the reactive transport calculations affecting the materials so simulated. This approach is exemplified with two grout types, namely, the so-called Standard mix 5/5, used in the upper parts of the structure, and the 'low-pH' P308B, to be injected at higher depths. The results of the digital reconstruction of the mineralogical composition of the hardened paste are entirely logical, as the microstructures display high degrees of hydration, large porosities and low or nil contents of aluminium compounds. Diffusion of solutes in the pore solution was considered to be the dominant transport process. A single scenario was studied for both mix designs and their performances were compared. The reactive transport model adequately reproduces the process of decalcification of the C-S-H and the precipitation of calcite, which is corroborated by empirical observations. It was found that the evolution of the deterioration process is sensitive to the chemical composition of groundwater, its effects being more severe when grout is set under continuous exposure to poorly mineralized groundwater. Results obtained appear to indicate that a correct conceptualization of the problem was accomplished and support the assumption that, in absence of more reliable empirical data, it might constitute a useful tool to estimate the durability of cement-based structures.","","Available from http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.cemconres.2009.11.006","","","","United States","2010-08-15T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: Cement and Concrete Research; Journal Volume: 40; Journal Issue: 8; Other Information: DOI: 10.1016/j.cemconres.2009.11.006; PII: S0008-8846(09)00337-8; Copyright (c) 2009 Elsevier Science B.V., Amsterdam, The Netherlands, All rights reserved.","","Medium: X; Size: page(s) 1278-1289","","","","Journal ID: ISSN 0008-8846; CCNRAI; TRN: US10R2267039349","10.1016/j.cemconres.2009.11.006","","2011-06-23T00:00:00Z","21443308","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/21443308","","Cement and Concrete Research","8","40"

A nondestructive assay technology that could provide direct measurement of fissile mass, particularly for the plutonium (Pu) isotopes, and improve upon the uncertainty of today’s confirmatory methods is needed. Lead slowing-down spectroscopy (LSDS) has been studied for the spent fuel application previously, but the nonlinear effects of assembly self shielding (of the interrogating neutron population) have led to discouraging assay accuracy for realistic pressurized water reactor fuels. In this paper, we describe the development of time-spectral analysis algorithms for LSDS intended to overcome these self-shielding effects. The algorithm incorporates the tabulated energy-dependent cross sections from key fissile and absorbing isotopes, but leaves their mass as free variables. Multi-parameter regression analysis is then used to directly calculate not only the mass of fissile isotopes in the fuel assembly (e.g., Pu-239, U-235, and Pu-241), but also the mass of key absorbing isotopes such as Pu-240 and U-238. Modeling-based assay results using a first-order self-shielding relationship indicate that LSDS has the potential to directly measure fissile isotopes with less than 5% average relative error, over a wide fuel burnup range. Shortcomings in the first-order self-shielding model and methods to improve the formulation are described.","","","Pacific Northwest National Lab.

In this study, two experimental approaches for performing RUS are experimentally analyzed and compared: 1) contact transduction using piezoelectric transducers (PZT) and 2) laser transduction using pulse laser excitation and laser interferometric detection. A single Zircaloy sample cut from a nuclear pressure tube was used for this study. By virtue of the non-contact nature, the quality factor, Q, for laser RUS is shown to be higher than the contact RUS. In addition, the probe beam for laser-RUS can be scanned to form a 2D image of each vibrational mode, which in turn enables unique mode identification. These defining characteristics of laser-RUS enable straightforward discrimination of closely spaced resonant modes and provide key advantages for improving the resolution of resonant ultrasound spectroscopy.","","","Idaho National Lab.

As with any fuel development program, the thermophysical properties of the fuel as a function of temperature are extremely important and must be well characterized in order to effectively model and predict fuel behavior under normal and off-normal irradiation conditions. For the alloy system under investigation, there is a lack of thermophysical property data, and in most cases, the data is relatively inconsistent and lacks sufficient explanation. Available literature on this alloy system comes mainly from studies done during the 1960s and 1970s, and often does not include sufficient information on fabrication history or conditions to draw conclusions for the current application. The current paper has investigated specific heat capacity, coefficient of linear thermal expansion, density, and thermal diffusivity that were then used to calculate alloy thermal conductivity as a function of temperature. The data obtained from this investigation was compared to available literature on similar U-Mo alloys, and in most cases are in good agreement.","","","Idaho National Lab.

The high density of the fuel is achieved by replacing the fuel meat with a single monolithic low enriched uranium-molybdenum fuel foil. Doing so creates differences in the mechanical and structural characteristics of the fuel plate because of the planar interface created by the fuel foil and cladding. Furthermore, the monolithic fuel meat will dominate the structural properties of the fuel plate rather than the aluminum matrix, which is characteristic of dispersion fuel types. Understanding the integrity and behavior of the fuel-clad interface during irradiation is of great importance for qualification of the new fuel, but can be somewhat challenging to determine with a single technique. Efforts aimed at addressing this problem are underway within the fuel development and qualification program, comprised of modeling, as-fabricated plate characterization, and post-irradiation examination. An initial finite element analysis model has been developed to investigate worst-case scenarios for the basic monolithic fuel plate structure, using typical mini-plate irradiation conditions in the Advanced Test Reactor. Initial analysis shows that the stress normal to the fuel-clad interface dominates during irradiation, and that the presence of small, rounded delaminations at the interface is not of great concern. However, larger and/or fuel-clad delaminations with sharp corners can create areas of concern, as maximum principal cladding stress, strain, displacement, and peak fuel temperature are all significantly increased. Furthermore, stresses resulting from temperature gradients that cause the plate to bow or buckle in an unconstrained fuel plate configuration is greatly enhanced in a constrained fuel plate configuration. The sensitivities of the model and input parameters are discussed, along with some overlap of initial experimental observations using as-fabricated plate characterization and post-irradiation examination.","","","Idaho National Lab.

The program would be implemented using an interconnected architecture of different codes ranging from the fuel cycle analysis code, which is the subject of the review, to fundamental physical and mechanistic codes. Four main functions are defined for the code: (1) the ability to characterize and deploy individual fuel cycle facilities and reactors in a simulation, while discretely tracking material movements, (2) the capability to perform an uncertainty analysis for each element of the fuel cycle and an aggregate uncertainty analysis, (3) the inclusion of an optimization engine able to optimize simultaneously across multiple objective functions, and (4) open and accessible code software and documentation to aid in collaboration between multiple entities and facilitate software updates. Existing codes, categorized as annualized or discrete fuel tracking codes, were assessed according to the four functions and associated requirements. These codes were developed by various government, education and industrial entities to fulfill particular needs. In some cases, decisions were made during code development to limit the level of detail included in a code to ease its use or to focus on certain aspects of a fuel cycle to address specific questions. The review revealed that while no two of the codes are identical, they all perform many of the same basic functions. No code was able to perform defined function 2 or several requirements of functions 1 and 3. Based on this review, it was concluded that the functions and requirements will be met only with development of a new code, referred to as GENIUS.","","","Idaho National Lab.

The design approach employs PEBBED, a reactor physics code specifically designed to solve for and analyze the asymptotic burnup state of pebble-bed reactors, in conjunction with a genetic algorithm to obtain a core that maximizes a fitness value that is a function of user-specified parameters. The uniqueness of the asymptotic core state and the small number of independent parameters that define it suggest that core geometry and fuel cycle can be efficiently optimized toward a specified objective. PEBBED exploits a novel representation of the distribution of pebbles that enables efficient coupling of the burnup and neutron diffusion solvers. With this method, even complex pebble recirculation schemes can be expressed in terms of a few parameters that are amenable to modern optimization techniques. With PEBBED, the user chooses the type and range of core physics parameters that represent the design space. A set of traits, each with acceptable and preferred values expressed by a simple fitness function, is used to evaluate the candidate reactor cores. The stochastic search algorithm automatically drives the generation of core parameters toward the optimal core as defined by the user.

This paper reports the first characterization results from a monolithic U- 10wt.%Mo fuel plate with a Zr diffusion barrier that was fabricated as part of a plate fabrication campaign for irradiation testing in the Advanced Test Reactor (ATR). Both scanning and transmission electron microscopy (SEM and TEM) were employed for analysis. At the interface between the Zr barrier and U-10wt.%Mo, going from Zr-to-U(Mo), UZr2, ?-UZr, Zr solidsolution and Mo2Zr phases were observed. The interface between AA6061 cladding and Zr barrier plate consisted of four layers, going from Al-to-Zr, (Al,Si)2Zr, (Al,Si)Zr3 (Al,Si)3Zr, and AlSi4Zr5. Irradiation behavior of these intermetallic phases is discussed based on their constituents. Characterization of as-fabricated phase constituents and microstructure would help understand the irradiation behavior of these fuel plates, interpret post-irradiation examination, and optimize the processing parameters of monolithic fuel system.","","","Idaho National Lab.

The partitioning of americium and its transmutation in fast reactor fuel would reduce high-level-waste long-term storage requirements by as much as two orders of magnitude. However, the lanthanides have very similar chemistry. They also have large neutron capture cross sections and poor metal alloy properties and thus they can not be incorporated into fast reactor fuel. A separation amenable to currently existing aqueous solvent extraction processes is therefore desired, and research is underway in Europe, Asia and the USA toward this end. Current concepts for this final separation rely on the use of soft-donor nitrogen or sulfur-containing ligands that favor complexation with the 5f orbitals of the actinides. In the USA, the most developed process is the TALSPEAK (Trivalent Actinide Lanthanide Separation by Phosphorous reagent Extraction from Aqueous Komplexes) process, based upon the competition between bis(2-ethylhexyl)phosphoric acid (HDEHP) in the organic phase and lactate-buffered diethylenetriamine pentaacetic acid (DTPA) in the aqueous phase. In Europe and Japan, current investigation is focused on the BTP diamide mixtures or dithiophosphinic acids. Any process eventually adopted must be robust under conditions of high-radiation dose-rates and acid hydrolysis. The effects of irradiation on solvent extraction formulations may result in: 1) decreased ligand concentrations resulting in lower metal distribution ratios, 2) decreased selectivity due to the generation of ligand radiolysis products that are complexing agents, 3) decreased selectivity due to the generation of diluent radiolysis products that are complexing agents, and 4) altered solvent performance due to films, precipitates, and increased viscocity. Many of the ligands associated with minor actinide/lanthanide separations are relatively new. Unlike their predecessors, many have been designed with radiation chemical principals in mind. The evolution of the BTPs and diamides show attention to these details, and a series of structural modifications have evolved that are meant to address them. In this fourth and final part in the series we report on the radiation chemistry of the minor actinide separations processes. We also provide a summary of the general radiolysis reactions that have implications for all ligand and diluent systems.","","","Idaho National Lab.

In this paper QUADRISO particles are proposed to manage the initial excess reactivity of high temperature reactors. The QUADRISO concept synergistically couples the decrease of the burnable poison with the decrease of the fissile materials at the fuel particle level. This mechanism is set up by introducing a burnable poison layer around the fuel kernel in ordinary TRISO particles or by mixing the burnable poison with any of the TRISO coated layers. At the beginning of life, the initial excess reactivity is small because some neutrons are absorbed in the burnable poison and they are prevented from entering the fuel kernel. At the end of life, when the absorber is almost depleted, more neutrons stream into the fuel kernel of QUADRISO particles causing fission reactions. The mechanism has been applied to a prismatic high temperature reactor with europium or erbium burnable absorbers, showing a significant reduction in the initial excess reactivity of the core.","","","Argonne National Lab.

While IL-based solvents are known to be efficient media for metal ion extraction, separations employing these solvents are frequently complicated by the loss of constituent IL ions to the aqueous phase, resulting in deteriorating performance. In this study, we have examined the extraction of pertechnetate and related tetra-oxo anions from aqueous solutions into IL-based solvents incorporating tetraalkylphosphonium bis[(trifluoromethyl)sulfonyl]imide and a crown ether. In contrast to various previously studied IL-based cation extraction systems, facile anion extraction without significant transfer of the IL ions to the aqueous phase has been observed. In addition, the solvents exhibit high distribution ratios (100-500 for pertechnetate), significant electrical conductivity (&gt;100 {micro}S/cm), and a wide ({approx}4 V) electrochemical window. The results suggest that these solvents may provide the basis for improved approaches to the extraction and recovery of a variety of anions.","","","Brookhaven National Lab.

However, upon examination, it was determined that despite homogenization, each of the alloys contained a small volume fraction precipitate phase. Through SEM and XRD, it was confirmed that the matrix retained the bcc-!-U phase, but the precipitate phases could not be identified using these methods. TEM specimens were prepared using site-specific focused ion beam (FIB) in situ lift out (INLO) technique to include at least one precipitate from each alloy.

U-Mo alloy foils are currently under investigation for potential fuel conversion of high power research reactors to low enriched uranium fuel. Although mechanical properties take on a secondary effect during irradiation, an understanding of the alloy behavior during fabrication and the effects of irradiation on the integrity of the fuel is essential. In general, the microhardness was insensitive to annealing temperature but decreased with annealing duration. Yield strength, Young’s modulus and ultimate tensile strength improved with both increasing annealing temperature and duration. The failure mode was also insensitive to annealing conditions, but was significantly controlled by the impurity concentration of the alloy, especially carbon. Values obtained from literature are also provided with reasonable agreement based on extrapolation of annealing duration, even though processing conditions and applications were quite different in some instances.","","","Idaho National Lab.

"Slugging Flow of Water Draining from the Bottom of a Non-Vented Container","Solbrig, Charles W","11 NUCLEAR FUEL CYCLE AND FUEL MATERIALS; AIR; BUBBLES; CONTAINERS; FLOW RATE; FRICTION; MULTIPHASE FLOW; NOZZLES; OPENINGS; ORIFICES; PRESSURE DROP; WATER; Bouyancy; Fluid FLow; Two-Phase Flow","Experiments were run to observe the behavior of water exiting through an orifice at the bottom of an non-vented container. Initially, the container is nearly full of water with a small air space on top. Once the orifice was uncovered, the slugging rate and the drain rate of the water leaving the container were measured. Upon initially opening the orifice, water drains out until the air pressure above the water reduces enough that the air pressure drop from inside to outside of the container supports the water column and the water stops flowing. Air then enters the container through the orifice forming a bubble, which grows until it detaches and bubbles through the water to reach the air space. Once the bubble enters, this added air increases the pressure in the air space enough to allow the water to start flowing out again. This cycle of flow out, flow stoppage, air inflow, and bubble breakoff continues over and over until the hole is closed or the container empties. This is referred to as the “slugging cycle.” A mechanism is proposed to describe the slugging cycle which is modeled analytically. This paper presents the description of the experiments, data obtained, the mechanistic model, and comparison of the model to the experimental data. The model predicts outflow rates close to experimental values. Flow rates from non-vented containers are more than 10 to 20 less than vented containers. The bubbles which must enter the container periodically to increase the internal air pressure stop the water flow momentarily so are responsible for this large decrease in flow rate. Swirl induced in the non-vented container causes the flow rates to increase by a factor of two. The flow rate out of a non-vented container is independent of water height which is in direct contrast to a vented container where the flow rate is proportional to the square root of the water height. The constant rate is due to the container pressure. The higher the water level, the lower the air pressure is in the container. This analytical model requires input of the bubble size. The volume recommended is the volume of a cylinder with the base of the orifice area and length of 3.3 cm. Slugging rate varies only a small amount falling in the range to 2 to 4 cycles/sec. Preliminary work with other containers indicates larger containers, larger orifices and nozzle exit shapes produce higher specific flow rates. The standard multiphase flow equations could not be used to analyze this situation because the two phases are not interpenetrating. Instead one phase must fully stop before the other can flow. Interpenetrating phases allow can pass one another each affecting the other with friction and virtual mass. An interesting observation: The negative air pressure in the container is observable. It equals the water height.","","","Idaho National Lab.

It reduces neptunium and plutonium, and the resultant hydrophilic complexes are separated from uranium by extraction with tributyl phosphate (TBP) in a hydrocarbon diluent. AHA undergoes hydrolysis to acetic acid which will impede the recycling of nitric acid. During recent discussions of the UREX process, it has been proposed to replace AHA by formohydroxamic acid (FHA). FHA will undergo hydrolysis to formic acid which is volatile, thus allowing the recycling of nitric acid. The reported reduction potentials of AHA and pertechnetate (TcO{sub 4}{sup -}) indicated that it may be possible for AHA to reduce technetium, altering its fate in the fuel cycle. At UNLV, it has been demonstrated that TcO{sub 4}{sup -} undergoes reductive nitrosylation by AHA under a variety of conditions. The resulting divalent technetium is complexed by AHA to form the pseudo-octahedral trans-aquonitrosyl (diacetohydroxamic)-technetium(II) complex ([Tc{sup II}(NO)(AHA){sub 2}H{sub 2}O]{sup +}). In this paper, we are reporting the synthesis of FHA and its complex formation with technetium along with the characterization of FHA crystals achieved by NMR and IR spectroscopy. Two experiments were conducted to investigate the complexation of FHA with Tc and the results were compared with previous data on AHA. The first experiment involved the elution of Tc from a Reillex HP anion exchange resin, and the second one monitored the complexation of technetium with FHA by UV-visible spectrophotometry.","","","Idaho National Lab.

These mixed solvent systems combine an acidic extractant with a neutral extractant to achieve the actinide/lanthanide separation. Depending on the neutral extractant used, three categorizations of systems can be considered, including combinations of acidic extractants with 1) diamides, 2) carbamoylmethylphosphine oxides, and 3) polydentate nitrogen-donor ligands. This review of relevant publications indicates that, although there is significant potential for practical exploitation of mixed neutral/acidic extractant systems to achieve a single-step separation of trivalent actinides from acidic high-level waste solutions, the fundamental chemistry underlying these combined systems is not yet well understood. For example, although there is strong evidence suggesting that adducts form between the neutral and acidic extractants, the nature of these adducts generally is not known. Likewise, the structures of the mixed complexes formed between the metal ions and the two different extactants are not fully understood. Research into these basic phenomena likely will provide clues about how to design practical mixed-extractant systems that can be used to efficiently separate the transuranic elements from the lanthanides and other components of irradiated fuel.","","","Pacific Northwest National Lab.

The coating layers surrounding the fuel kernels in these spherical particles, termed the TRISO coating, act as a pressure vessel that retains fission products. The quality of the fuel reflects the number of particle failures that occur during reactor operation, where failed particles become a source for fission products that can then diffuse through the fuel element matrix. The failure probability for any batch of particles, which has traditionally been calculated using the Monte Carlo method, depends on statistical variations in design parameters and on variations in the strengths of coating layers among particles in the batch. An alternative approach to calculating failure probabilities is developed herein that uses direct numerical integration of a failure probability integral. Because this is a multiple integral where the statistically varying parameters become integration variables, a fast numerical integration approach is also developed. In sample cases analyzed involving multiple failure mechanisms, results from the integration methods agree closely with Monte Carlo results. Additionally, the fast integration approach, particularly, is shown to significantly improve efficiency of failure probability calculations. These integration methods have been implemented in the PARFUME fuel performance code along with the Monte Carlo method, where each serves to verify accuracy of the others.","","","Idaho National Lab.

"Anisole nitration during gamma-irradiation of aqueous nitrite and nitrate solutions: Free radical versus ionic mechanisms","Elias, Gracy; Mincher, Bruce J; Martin, Leigh R; Mezyk, Stephen P; Cullen, Thomas","11 NUCLEAR FUEL CYCLE AND FUEL MATERIALS; AEROSOLS; ANISOLE; AROMATICS; CHEMISTRY; DISTRIBUTION; HYDROXYL RADICALS; IRRADIATION; ISOMERS; NITRATES; NITRATION; NITRITES; NUCLEAR FUELS; OXIDATION; PRODUCTION; RADIATIONS; RADICALS; REACTION KINETICS; REPROCESSING; WATER TREATMENT; Anisole; Nitration","Radiolytic aromatic nitration mechanisms in the condensed phase are ubiquitous, and especially of interest in atmospheric aerosol chemistry, water treatment by advanced oxidation technologies, and nuclear fuel reprocessing. Here, the radiolytically-induced nitration reactions of anisole, the simplest aryl alkyl ether, were investigated in ?-irradiated acidic nitrate solution, and in neutral nitrate and nitrite solutions. The nitrated anisole product distribution was the same with and without radiation in acidic solution, although more products were formed as a result of irradiation. This suggests that the mechanism of nitration in acidic solution is nitronium ion- induced electrophilic aromatic substitution. The rate of production of nitrated products in neutral nitrate solution was much lower, although the distribution of isomers was similar to that expected for nitronium ion electrophilic nitration. In contrast, the product distribution in neutral nitrite solution approached a statistically random substitution pattern, suggesting a non-electrophilic free radical reaction involving •NO2 radical. When hydroxyl radical (•OH) was scavenged by varying the initial nitrite concentration, the concentration of nitrated products increased with increasing nitrite, indicating that the reaction was probably one of direct •NO2 radical addition. However, this latter mechanism will not be important in acidic solutions, such as those often encountered in atmospheric aerosols or ?-irradiated nuclear fuel reprocessing solutions, due to low amounts of produced •NO2 radical and the low reaction rate constants for the •NO2 radical with aromatic compounds.","","","Idaho National Lab.

Significant progress has been made with the discovery of novel chemical hydrides, complex metal hydrides, and adsorption substrates which continue to optimize both thermodynamics and kinetics of hydrogen sorption. Chemical hydrides typically offer the largest theoretical gravimetric capacities. Autrey et al. have recently shown that mechanical milling of alkali metal hydrides with ammonia borane can further lower the decomposition temperature. In all cases, however, many challenges remain in order to meet the current US DOE performance targets. Amine boranes are being considered for hydrogen storage materials since they contain significant quantities of hydrogen which potentially can be released at low temperatures (80-150 C) via chemical reactions. Ammonia borane, NH{sub 3}BH{sub 3}, is one of the most promising in this class as it decomposes to release greater than two moles of pure hydrogen gas (14 wt%) below 160 C. Although isoelectronic to ethane, NH{sub 3}BH{sub 3} is a solid at room temperature due to the di-hydrogen bonding network formed between the amine protons and boron hydrides in the solid state lattice. Further, it has been shown that the hydrogen release mechanism involves transformation and isomerization to an ionic dimer where a hydride migrates from one boron to the adjacent boron in the dimer. The greatest challenge to the use of ammonia borane as a hydrogen fuel is the regeneration path from spent fuel to ammonia borane again. The proposed chemical synthesis involves complicated organometallic reactions to form boron hydrogen bonds from the thermodynamically stable polyimidoborane products (BNH){sub n}. Recent theoretical calculations suggested that incorporation of carbon atoms into the (BNH)n product would be less thermodynamically stable. These (CBNH)n compounds are potentially less energy intensive making regeneration of the amine borane fuel more feasible [22]. In the present study, tert-butylamine borane is investigated by heteronuclear in situ solid state NMR to understand hydrogen release from a hydrocarbon containing amine borane. tbutylamine borane has similar physical properties to amine borane with a melting point of 96 C. A single proton has been replaced with a t-butylamine group resulting in a weakening of the dihydrogen bonding framework. t-butylamine borane has a theoretical gravimetric hydrogen density of 15.1%; however, isobutane can also be evolved rather than hydrogen. If decomposition yields one mole isobutane and two moles hydrogen, 4.5 wt% H2 gas will be evolved. More importantly for the present work, the resulting spent fuel should be comprised of both (BNH)n and (CBNH)n polyimidoboranes.","","","Oak Ridge Y-12 Plant (Y-12), Oak Ridge, TN (United States)","USDOE Office of Defense Programs (DP)","","United States","2010-03-18T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: Ceramic Transactions","","Medium: ED","","Y/DZ-3078","DE-AC05-00OR22800","Journal ID: ISSN 1042-1122; CETREW; TRN: US1002798","10.1002/9781118019467.ch7","","2016-05-24T00:00:00Z","977147","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/977147","https://www.osti.gov/servlets/purl/977147","Ceramic Transactions","",""

A recent critical analysis by Sovacool (2008) gives a clearer picture. ""It should be noted that nuclear power is not directly emitting greenhouse gas emissions, but rather that lifecycle emissions occur through plant construction, operation, uranium mining and milling, and plant decommissioning."" ""[N]uclear energy is in no way 'carbon free' or 'emissions free,' even though it is much better (from purely a carbon-equivalent emissions standpoint) than coal, oil, and natural gas electricity generators, but worse than renewable and small scale distributed generators"" (Sovacool 2008). According to Sovacool, at an estimated 66 g CO2 equivalent per kilowatt-hour (gCO2e/kWh), nuclear power emits 15 times less CO2 per unit electricity generated than unscrubbed coal generation (at 1050 gCO2e/kWh), but 7 times more than the best renewable, wind (at 9 gCO2e/kWh). The U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission (2009) has long recognized CO2 emissions in its regulations concerning the environmental impact of the nuclear fuel cycle. In Table S-3 of 10 CFR 51.51(b), NRC lists a 1000-MW(electric) nuclear plant as releasing as much CO2 as a 45-MW(e) coal plant. A large share of the carbon emissions from the nuclear fuel cycle is due to the energy consumption to enrich uranium by the gaseous diffusion process. A switch to either gas centrifugation or laser isotope separation would dramatically reduce the carbon emissions from the nuclear fuel cycle.","","","Pacific Northwest National Lab.

The modal shapes, used for mode identification, of several resonant modes are determined before and after annealing by raster scanning the laser interferometric probe. This information is used to isolate the motion of individual modes during high temperature annealing. The evolution of a particular mode during annealing is examined in detail. During recrystallization, the center frequency of this mode shifts by approximately 20% of the original value. Using electron backscatter data it is shown that the majority of this shift is due to changes in the polycrystal average elastic stiffness tensor, driven by changes in texture, and that changes in dislocation density and pinning length are secondary influences.","","","Idaho National Lab.

Mechanisms for the hydrolysis reactions are studied here with density functional theory and the Stuttgart small-core scalar relativistic pseudopotential and associated basis set for uranium. The reaction of a single UF{sub 6} molecule with a water molecule in the gas phase has been previously predicted to proceed over a relatively sizeable barrier of 78.2 kJ {center_dot} mol{sup -1}, indicating this reaction is only feasible at elevated temperatures. Given the observed formation of a second morphology for the UO{sub 2} product coupled with the observations of rapid, spontaneous hydrolysis at ambient conditions, an alternate reaction pathway must exist. In the present work, two trimolecular hydrolysis mechanisms are studied with density functional theory: (1) the reaction between two UF{sub 6} molecules and one water molecule, and (2) the reaction of two water molecules with a single UF{sub 6} molecule. The predicted reaction of two UF{sub 6} molecules with one water molecule displays an interesting 'fluorine-shuttle' mechanism, a significant energy barrier of 69.0 kJ {center_dot} mol{sup -1} to the formation of UF{sub 5}OH, and an enthalpy of reaction ({Delta}H{sub 298}) of +17.9 kJ {center_dot} mol{sup -1}. The reaction of a single UF{sub 6} molecule with two water molecules displays a 'proton-shuttle' mechanism, and is more favorable, having a slightly lower computed energy barrier of 58.9 kJ {center_dot} mol{sup -1} and an exothermic enthalpy of reaction ({Delta}H{sub 298}) of -13.9 kJ {center_dot} mol{sup -1}. The exothermic nature of the overall UF{sub 6} + 2 {center_dot} H{sub 2}O trimolecular reaction and the lowering of the barrier height with respect to the bimolecular reaction are encouraging; however, the sizable energy barrier indicates further study of the UF{sub 6} hydrolysis reaction mechanism is warranted to resolve the remaining discrepancies between the predicted mechanisms and experimental observations.","","available","Savannah River Site (SRS), Aiken, SC (United States)","USDOE","","United States","2010-02-25T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: Journal of Physical Chemistry A","","Medium: ED","","SRNS-STI-2010-00143","DE-AC09-08SR22470","TRN: US1101438","","","2011-04-07T00:00:00Z","1009390","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/1009390","https://www.osti.gov/servlets/purl/1009390","Journal of Physical Chemistry A","",""

This issue can be addressed at two different levels: 1) whether DU nanoparticles could have been produced, and 2) whether persons within the aerosol environment could have been exposed to these nanoparticles. We cannot rule out the possibility that DU nanoparticles could have resulted from the highly energetic interaction of a large-caliber DU penetrator and DU (Abrams only) or non-DU (Abrams or Bradley) armor. However, based on visual and instrumental analysis of hundreds of microscopic samples derived from cascade impactor stages, filter samples, moving filter samples and collected bulk powders, little to no evidence was obtained that demonstrated the existence of DU nanoparticles. Given that the initial atmospheric aerosol concentrations within both the Abrams and Bradley were extremely high, tens of grams per cubic meter, coagulation and agglomeration of primary aerosol particles occurred readily and very rapidly within the crew compartment atmosphere. Deposition and clearance behavior of any nanoparticles would have been subsumed by the aggregate particles on which they resided.","","","Pacific Northwest National Lab.

The effective energy range for the LSDS is 0.1 eV to 10 keV with energy resolution of about 35%. Two new LSDS applications were recently developed at RPI; the first enables simultaneous measurements of the fission cross section and fission fragment mass and energy distributions as a function of the incident neutron energy.

We integrated a low-cost pneumatic setup and demonstrated that the drop-on-demand approach has some advantages, such as low inventory of feed solution (attractive for laboratory-scale research), improved drop diameter control, reproducibility, scale-up to desired throughput by simple multiplication of the number of dispensing units, and simple remote operation. However, limitations on reproducibility and drop diameter control still exist due to the intrinsic variation of physical properties, viscosity, and dispensing-tip wettability during the internal gelation process. These adverse effects can be mitigated, to a certain extent, by carefully controlling the temperature of the feed as uniformly as possible. We validated the drop-on-demand generation method by producing solid kernels of yttrium-stabilized zirconia and soft gel microspheres of iron hydroxide. In addition, we have measured the diameter change at each principal process stage. Based on the observed gas entrainment/absorption in the gel spheres, we conjectured that aging and washing are likely the critical stages determining the final precision to which microspheres can be made. Finally, we comment on potential improvements that add robustness to the method for handling other metal precursors in aqueous solutions.","","","Oak Ridge National Lab.

It is found that the irradiation performance of a plate-type dispersion fuel depends on the radiation stability of the various phases in a fuel plate. Transmission electron microscopy was performed on a sample (peak fuel mid-plane temperature approximately 109 degrees C and fission density approximately 4.5 x 10 27 fm-3) taken from an irradiated U–7Mo dispersion fuel plate with Al–2Si alloy matrix to investigate the role of Si addition in the matrix on the radiation stability of the phase(s) in the U–7Mo fuel/matrix interaction layer. A similar interaction layer that forms in irradiated U–7Mo dispersion fuels with pure Al matrix has been found to exhibit poor irradiation stability, likely as a result of poor fission gas retention. The interaction layer for both U–7Mo/Al–2Si and U–7Mo/Al fuels is observed to be amorphous. However, unlike the latter, the amorphous layer for the former was found to effectively retain fission gases in areas with high Si concentration. When the Si concentration becomes relatively low, the fission gas bubbles agglomerate into fewer large pores. Within the U–7Mo fuel particles, a bubble superlattice ordered as fcc structure and oriented parallel to the bcc metal lattice was observed where the average bubble size and the superlattice constant are approximately 3.5 nm and approximately 7.5 nm, respectively. The estimated fission gas inventory in the bubble superlattice correlates well with the fission density in the fuel.","","","Idaho National Lab.

Metal fuel compositions in these designs have included varying amounts of U, Pu, Zr, and minor actinides (Am, Np). Investigations into the phase behavior and relationships based on the alloy constituents have been conducted using x-ray diffraction and differential thermal analysis. Results of these investigations, along with proposed relationships between observed behavior and alloy composition, are provided. In general, observed behaviors can be predicted by a ternary U-Pu-Zr phase diagram, with transition temperatures being most dependent on U content.

To understand the atomic processes that control this migration of voids, we performed molecular dynamics (MD) simulations on single crystal UO2 with voids of diameter 2.2 nm. An external temperature gradient was applied across the simulation cell. At the end of the simulation run, it was observed that the voids had moved towards the hot end of the simulation cell. The void migration velocity obtained from the simulations was compared with the phenomenological equations. Surface diffusion of the slowest moving specie, i.e., uranium, was found to be the dominant mechanism for void migration. The contribution from lattice diffusion and thermal stress gradient to the void migration was analyzed and found to be negligible. By extrapolation, a crossover from the surface-diffusion controlled mechanism to the lattice-diffusion controlled mechanism was found to occur for voids with sizes in the ?m range.","","","Idaho National Lab.

We have carried out a molecular dynamics simulation study to investigate this complexation process, including the molecular composition of the various complex species, the corresponding structure, and the equilibrium distribution of the complexes. The observed structures of the complexes suggest that in aqueous solution, uranyls are generally hydrated by 5 water molecules in the equatorial plane. When associating with nitrate ions, a water molecule is replaced by a nitrate ion, preserving the five-fold coordination and planar symmetry. Analysis of the pair correlation function between uranyl and nitrate suggests that nitrates bind to uranyl in aqueous solution mainly in a monodentate mode, although a small portion of bidentates occur. Dynamic association and dissociation between uranyls and nitrates take place in aqueous solution with a substantial amount of fluctuation in the number of various uranyl nitrate species. The average number of the uranyl mononitrate complexes shows a dependence on acid concentration consistent with equilibrium-constant analysis, namely, the concentration of [UO2NO3]+ increases with nitric acid concentration.","","","Oak Ridge National Lab.

We have developed static microcosms that are similar to bioreduction process studies in situ under laminar flow conditions or in sediment pores. Uranium L{sub 3}-edge X-ray absorption near-edge spectroscopy analysis with depth in the microcosms indicated that transformation of U{sup VI} to U{sup IV} occurred by at least two distinct processes. Extended X-ray absorption fine structure (EXAFS) analysis indicated that initial U{sup VI} species associated with C- and P-containing ligands were transformed to U{sup IV} in the form of uraninite and U associated with Fe-bound ligands. Microbial community analysis identified putative Fe{sup III} and sulfate reducers at two different depths in the microcosms. The slow reduction of U{sup VI} to U{sup IV} may contribute the stability of U{sup IV} within microcosms at 11 months after a decrease in bioreducing conditions due to limited electron donors.","","","Argonne National Lab.

The focus of this work is to develop TRU fuel kernels with high crush strengths, good ellipticity, and adequately dispersed silicon carbide (SiC). The submicron SiC particles in the TRU kernels are to serve as getters for excess oxygen and to potentially sequester palladium, rhodium, and ruthenium, which could damage the coatings during irradiation. Zirconium oxide microspheres stabilized with yttrium were used as surrogates because zirconium and TRU microspheres from the internal gelation process are amorphous and encounter similar processing problems. The hardness of SiC required modifications to the experimental system that was used to make uranium carbide kernels. Suitable processing conditions and equipment changes were identified so that the SiC could be homogeneously dispersed in gel spheres for subsequent calcination into strong spherical kernels.","","","Oak Ridge National Lab.

These mixed solvent systems combine an acidic extractant with a neutral extractant to achieve the actinide/lanthanide separation. Depending on the neutral extractant used, three categorizations of systems can be considered, including combinations of acidic extractants with 1 diamides, 2 carbamoylmethylphosphine oxides, and 3 polydentate nitrogen-donor ligands. This review of relevant publications indicates that, although there is significant potential for practical exploitation of mixed neutral/acidic extractant systems to achieve a single-step separation of trivalent actinides from acidic high-level waste solutions, the fundamental chemistry underlying these combined systems is not yet well understood. For example, although there is strong evidence suggesting that adducts form between the neutral and acidic extractants, the nature of these adducts generally is not known. Likewise, the structures of the mixed complexes formed between the metal ions and the two different extractants are not fully understood. Research into these basic phenomena likely will provide clues about how to design practical mixed-extractant systems that can be used to efficiently separate the transuranic elements from the lanthanides and other components of irradiated fuel.","","","Argonne National Lab.

In particular, efforts to largely consume transuranics in a single-pass will require the fuel to undergo very high burnup. This deep burn concept will thus make the proposed plutonia TRISO fuel particularly likely to suffer kernel migration where carbon in the buffer layer and inner pyrolytic carbon layer is transported from the high temperature side of the particle to the low temperature side. This phenomenon is oberved to cause particle failure and therefore must be mitigated. The addition of SiC or ZrC in the oxide kernel or in a layer in communication with the kernel will lower the oxygen potential and therefore prevent kernel migration, and this has been demonstrated with SiC. In this work a thermochemical analysis was performed to predict oxygen potential behavior in the plutonia TRISO fuel to burnups of 50% FIMA with and without the presence of oxygen gettering SiC and ZrC. Kernel migration is believed to be controlled by CO gas transporting carbon from the hot side to the cool side, and CO pressure is governed by the oxygen potential in the presence of carbon. The gettering phases significantly reduce the oxygen potential and thus CO pressure in an otherwise PuO2-x kernel, and prevent kernel migration by limiting CO gas diffusion through the buffer layer. The reduction in CO pressure can also reduce the peak pressure within the particles by ~50%, thus reducing the likelihood of pressure-induced particle failure. A model for kernel migration was used to semi-quantitatively assess the effect of controlling oxygen potential with SiC or ZrC and did demonstrated the dramatic effect of the addition of these phases on carbon transport.","","","Oak Ridge National Lab.

However, attempts to convert these amorphous gel spheres into kernels have failed due to cracking during the subsequent heat treatments. The porosity of the amorphous microspheres is typically not sufficient to permit the gases that are formed during subsequent heat treatments to escape. The microspheres will crack when the internal pressure becomes too great. In this study, several treatment techniques were applied to zirconium microspheres stabilized with yttrium in an effort to reduce or eliminate cracking. A combination of water washes, a pressurized water treatment at 473 K for 3 h, and a Dowanol PM treatment was shown to eliminate the cracking problem with the zirconium microspheres, which were heated to 1438 K.","","","Oak Ridge National Lab.

Previous studies have shown that heating induces stepwise dehydration and reduction in basal spacing. Structures of the lower hydrates have not been determined previously because suitable single crystals of these phases have yet to be prepared. We have used synchrotron X-ray diffraction data collected during in situ, continuous heating of powdered metatorbernite to elucidate structures of its lower hydrates. Using Rietveld analysis, we have determined that autunite-type sheets remain intact through the first dehydration event above room temperature (onset 102 C). We have discovered that the second dehydration event (onset 138 C) triggers a major reconstruction to uranophane-type sheets, composed of chains of edge-sharing uranyl pentagonal bipyramids linked to one another by sharing edges and vertices with phosphate tetrahedra. This reconstruction enables the structure to overcome steric constraints on the minimum possible basal spacing, while maintaining Cu within the interlayer. Four distinct phases have been identified with increasing temperature: Cu(UO{sub 2}){sub 2}(PO{sub 4}){sub 2} {center_dot} 8H{sub 2}O, space group P4/n, a = 6.96519(23), c = 17.3102(8) {angstrom}; Cu(UO{sub 2}){sub 2}(PO{sub 4}){sub 2} {center_dot} 6.1H{sub 2}O, space group P4/n, a = 6.95510(29), c = 16.6604(9) {angstrom}; Cu(UO{sub 2}){sub 2}(PO{sub 4}){sub 2} {center_dot} 3H{sub 2}O, space group P2{sub 1}, a = 14.4979(23), b = 7.0159(9), c = 6.6312(10) {angstrom}, {beta} = 107.585(14){sup o}; and a lower hydrate with monoclinic or triclinic symmetry, a 6.7, b 7, c 11 {angstrom}, {beta} 100{sup o}.

The system, developed by the PCP team at Argonne National Laboratory, involves hardware modification, application software development, secured database and web server development, and irradiation experiments. In April 2008, Argonne tested key features of the RFID tracking and monitoring system in a weeklong, 1700 mile (2736 km) demonstration employing 14 empty type B fissile material drums of three designs (models 9975, 9977 and ES-3100) that have been certified for shipment by the DOE and the US Nuclear Regulatory Commission. The demonstration successfully integrated global positioning system (GPS) technology for vehicle tracking, satellite/cellular (general packet radio service, or GPRS) technologies for wireless communication, and active RFID tags with multiple sensors (seal integrity, shock, temperature, humidity and battery status) on drums. In addition, the demonstration integrated geographic information system (GIS) technology with automatic alarm notifications of incidents and generated buffer zone reports for emergency response and management of staged incidents. The demonstration was sponsored by EM and the US National Nuclear Security Administration, with the participation of Argonne, Savannah River and Oak Ridge National Laboratories. Over 50 authorised stakeholders across the country observed the demonstration via secured Internet access. The DOE PCP and national laboratories are working on several RFID system implementation projects at selected DOE sites, as well as continuing device and systems development and widening applications beyond DOE sites and possibly beyond nuclear materials to include other radioactive materials.","","","Argonne National Lab.

We microscopically examined the pore structure of hardened cement pastes to partially verify the model. Effective diffusivities of tritiated water in hardened cement pastes were also obtained experimentally, and were shown to be proportional to the estimated transport porosity.","","Available from http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.cemconres.2009.08.012","","","","United States","2009-12-15T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: Cement and Concrete Research; Journal Volume: 39; Journal Issue: 12; Other Information: DOI: 10.1016/j.cemconres.2009.08.012; PII: S0008-8846(09)00225-7; Copyright (c) 2009 Elsevier Science B.V., Amsterdam, The Netherlands, All rights reserved.","","Medium: X; Size: page(s) 1149-1155","","","","Journal ID: ISSN 0008-8846; CCNRAI; TRN: US10R0416075638","10.1016/j.cemconres.2009.08.012","","2010-10-28T00:00:00Z","21344736","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/21344736","","Cement and Concrete Research","12","39"

To facilitate the structural characterization of the precipitated solids derived from the neutralized raffinate, a set of reference compounds were synthesized and analyzed. The reference compounds include crystalline scorodite, poorly-crystalline scorodite, iron(III)-arsenate co-precipitates obtained under different pH conditions, and arsenate-adsorbed on goethite. The poorly-crystalline scorodite (prepared at pH 4 with Fe/As = 1) has similar As local structure as that of crystalline scorodite. Both As and Fe K-edge XAFS of poorly-crystalline scorodite yield consistent results on As-Fe (or Fe-As) shell. From As K-edge analysis the As-Fe shell has an inter-atomic distance of 3.33 ± 0.02 Å and coordination number of 3.2; while from Fe K-edge analysis the Fe-As distance and coordination number are 3.31 ± 0.02 Å and 3.8, respectively. These are in contrast with the typical arsenate adsorption on bidentate binuclear sites on goethite surfaces, where the As-Fe distance is 3.26 ± 0.03 Å and coordination number is close to 2. A similar local structure identified in the poorly-crystalline scorodite is also found in co-precipitation solids (Fe(III)/As(V) = 3) when precipitated at the same pH (pH = 4): As-Fe distance 3.30 ± 0.03 Å and coordination number 3.9; while at pH = 8 the co-precipitate has As-Fe distance of 3.27 ± 0.03 Å and coordination number about 2, resembling more closely the adsorption case. The As local structure in the two neutralized raffinate solid series (precipitated at pH values up to 7) closely resembles that in the poorly-crystalline scorodite. All of the raffinate solids have the same As-Fe inter-atomic distance as that in the poorly-crystalline scorodite, and a systematic decrease in the As-Fe coordination is observed when pH is progressively increased; the basic poorly-crystalline scorodite structural feature remains in the raffinate solid up to pH 7.","The Geochemical Society; The Meteoritical Society","","Argonne National Lab.

The current irradiation test series design, designated AFC2, includes minor additions of rare earth elements to simulate expected fission product carry-over from the electrochemical molten salt reprocessing technique. The metal fuel alloys have been fabricated by an arc casting technique. The as-cast fuel alloys have been investigated for phase and thermal properties, specifically, enthalpies of transition, transition temperatures, and room temperature phase characteristics. Results and observations related to these characteristics for the “fresh” fuel alloys are provided. The alloy compositions are based on a U-20Pu-3Am-2Np-15Zr alloy, along with additions of 1 and 1.5 wt% RE (at the expense of U) where RE denotes rare earth alloy of cerium, lanthanum, praseodymium and neodymium). Phase behavior and associated transitions have been compared to available U-Pu-Zr ternary diagrams with acceptable agreement. Enthalpies of transition were deconvoluted from heating and cooling thermal traces for relatively reliable values. The rare earth additions to the base alloy have a minimal influence on the room temperature phases present, but the room temperature phases present slightly impacted the enthalpies of transition and transition temperatures.","","","Idaho National Lab.

This transformation enables implicit treatment of distinct physics using traditional semi- implicit and physics-based splitting approaches without a loss of consistency be- tween the original and preconditioned systems.

The experiments expanded on previous efforts to develop a quick-screening technique for candidate alloys for cladding materials (HT-9) and actinide-based mixed oxide fuel mixtures (represented by the zirconia coating) by investigating the effect of both coating composition and alloy pretreatment conditions on the high temperature reactions. In particular, the presence of the element Ga (a potential impurity in mixed oxide fuel) in the initial zirconia coating was found to accelerate the rate of oxide growth relative to that of yttria-stabilized zirconia studied previously. In addition, HT-9 samples that were subjected to different thermal pretreatments gave different results. The results suggest that the presence of Ga in a mixed oxide fuel will enhance the corrosion of HT-9 cladding under the conditions of this study, although the extent of enhancement is influenced by thermal pretreatment of the cladding material. The results also demonstrate the need to combine Raman spectroscopy with other techniques, particularly photoelectron spectroscopy, for optimizing composition and/or fabrication conditions of both cladding and oxide fuels for advanced nuclear reactors.","","","Pacific Northwest National Lab.

Measured configurations included a bare plutonium sphere as well as the plutonium sphere reflected by the following nickel thicknesses: 1.27, 2.54, 3.81, 5.08, and 7.62 cm. A certain ratio of spectral quantities was measured for each configuration which varies linearly with the keff of the system. In addition, two types of Monte Carlo calculations were employed: a modified version of MCNP to calculate the ratio of spectral quantities and a KCODE calculation. From the measured and computed quantities the multiplication of each configuration can be approximated. A comprehensive uncertainty analysis was then performed that includes uncertainties in the geometry and materials present in the system in addition to the uncertainties in the method and nuclear data.","","","Idaho National Lab.

The separation is necessary to remove isobaric interferences in the determination of 137Cs, 135Cs, 137Ba, 135Ba, which are used to determine the age of a sample from radioactive decay or purification. The micro-column extraction chromatography system employs compressed nitrogen to move liquid through the system, compared to gravity or pumped liquids that are typically used for separations. The use of compressed gas allows for accurate and precise recovery of all liquids put into the chromatography system, enabling very accurate dilutions. The use of a small analytical column permits the use of very small amounts of liquids to be used. As a benefit, the amount of radiological waste that is generated in the separation process is minimized. For this work, a commercially available Sr-Resin™ was used to perform the separation for the above mentioned analytes. The column consists of a 7 inch piece of 1/16 in. O.D. x 0.030 in I.D. Teflon™ tubing having an internal volume of 81 µL. To this column, 49 mg of resin was added. The columns are re-usable after regeneration with 3 M HNO3. All samples were separated using batch collection, although real time analysis is possible with the current experimental design. A 1 % acetic acid solution was determined to be the best extractant for Ba. A flow rate of 0.1 mL/min was determined to be optimal for the separation of Ba. Complete recovery of the Cs and Ba was achieved, within the systematic error of the experiments.","","","Idaho National Lab.

The sediment contained U(VI) that was associated with diffusion-limited intragrain regions within its mm-size granitic lithic fragments. The sediment was first treated to promote phosphate mineral precipitation in batch suspensions spiked with 1 and 50 mM aqueous phosphate, and calcium in a stoichiometric ratio of mineral hydroxyapatite. The phosphate-treated sediment was then leached to solubilize contaminant U(VI) in a column system using a synthetic groundwater that contained chemical components representative of Hanford groundwater. Phosphate treatment significantly decreased the extent of U(VI) release from the sediment. Within the experimental duration of about 200 pore volumes, the effluent U(VI) concentrations were consistently lower by over one and two orders of magnitude after the sediment was treated with 1 and 50 mM of phosphate, respectively. Measurements of solid phase U(VI) using various spectroscopes and chemical extraction of the sediment collectively indicated that the inhibition of U(VI) release from the sediment was caused by: 1) U(VI) adsorption to the secondary phosphate precipitates and 2) the transformation of initially present U(VI) mineral phases to less soluble forms.","","","Pacific Northwest National Lab.

An important part of the research is identifying and quantifying field-scale models of the principal terminal electron-accepting processes (TEAPs) during biostimulation and the consequent biogeochemical impacts to the subsurface receiving environment. Integrating abiotic chemistry with the microbially mediated TEAPs in the reaction network brings into play geochemical observations (e.g., pH, alkalinity, redox potential, major ions, and secondary minerals) that the reactive transport model must recognize. These additional constraints provide for a more systematic and mechanistic interpretation of the field behaviors during biostimulation. The reaction network specification developed for the 2002 biostimulation field experiment was successfully applied without additional calibration to the 2003 and 2007 field experiments. The robustness of the model specification is significant in that 1) the 2003 biostimulation field experiment was performed with 3 times higher acetate concentrations than the previous biostimulation in the same field plot (i.e., the 2002 experiment), and 2) the 2007 field experiment was performed in a new unperturbed plot on the same site. The biogeochemical reactive transport simulations accounted for four TEAPs, two distinct functional microbial populations, two pools of bioavailable Fe(III) minerals (iron oxides and phyllosilicate iron), uranium aqueous and surface complexation, mineral precipitation, and dissolution. The conceptual model for bioavailable iron reflects recent laboratory studies with sediments from the Old Rifle Uranium Mill Tailings Remedial Action (UMTRA) site that demonstrated that the bulk (~90%) of Fe(III) bioreduction is associated with the phyllosilicates rather than the iron oxides. The uranium reaction network includes a U(VI) surface complexation model based on laboratory studies with Old Rifle UMTRA sediments and aqueous complexation reactions that include ternary complexes (e.g., calcium-uranyl-carbonate). The bioreduced U(IV), Fe(II), and sulfide components produced during the experiments are strongly associated with the solid phases and may play an important role in long-term uranium immobilization.","","","Pacific Northwest National Lab.

The simulant is required for engineered-scaled testing of pretreatment processes in a non-radiological facility. The waste material examined was derived from the bismuth phosphate process, which was the first industrial process implemented to separate plutonium from irradiated nuclear fuel. The bismuth phosphate sludge is a complex mixture rich in bismuth, iron, sodium, phosphorus, silicon, and uranium. The form of phosphorus in this particular tank waste material is of specific importance because that is the primary component (other than water-soluble sodium salts) that must be removed from the high-level waste solids by pretreatment. This work shows unequivocally that the phosphorus present in this waste material is not present as bismuth phosphate. Rather, the phosphorus appears to be incorporated mostly into an amorphous iron(III) phosphate species. The bismuth in the sludge solids is best described as bismuth ferrite, BiFeO3.

Given the structural homology between biogenic uraninite nanoparticles obtained from Shewanella oneidensis MR-1 and chemogenic UO2.00, similar surface free energy and reactivity is expected. Batch and flow-through dissolution experiments were conducted along with spectroscopic analyses to compare both materials with respect to their equilibrium solubility, dissolution mechanisms, and dissolution kinetics in water of varied oxygen and carbonate concentrations. Both uraninite materials exhibited a similar intrinsic solubility of ~10-8 M under reducing conditions. The observation of comparable dissolution rates under anoxic as well as oxidizing conditions is consistent with the structural bulk homology of biogenic and stoichiometric uraninite. Carbonate, a ubiquitous groundwater component and strong complexant of U(VI), reversibly promoted the uraninite dissolution not only under moderately oxidizing, but also under reducing conditions, where the biogenic material yielded higher dissolution rates than the chemogenic. This difference is in accordance with the higher proportion of U(V) detected on the biogenic uraninite surface by means of x-ray photoelectron spectroscopy. Reasonable sources of the intermediate U(V) are discussed. The observed increase of the dissolution rates can be explained by carbonate complexation of U(V) facilitating the detachment of U(V) from the uraninite surface. The fraction of surface U(VI) increased with increasing oxygen concentration; this result is consistent with x-ray absorption near-edge spectra showing evidence of higher-valent U in the form of UO2+x (0 < x ≤ 0.20). In equilibrium with air, combined spectroscopic results support the formation of a near-surface layer of U4O9 (UO2.25) coated by an outer layer of U(VI) corresponding to a metaschoepite-like phase. This result is in accordance with flow-through dissolution experiments indicating control of the dissolution rate of surface-oxidized uraninite by the solubility of metaschoepite under the tested conditions. Although U(V) has been observed in electrochemical studies on the dissolution of nuclear fuel, this is the first investigation that demonstrates the formation of a stable U(V) intermediate phase on the surface of submicron-sized uraninite particles suspended in aqueous solutions.","","","Pacific Northwest National Lab.

There exist significant experience and generally accepted recommendations on remediation of lands with residual radioactive contamination; however, there are hardly any such recommendations on remediation of cooling ponds that, in most cases, are fairly large water reservoirs. The literature only describes remediation of minor reservoirs containing radioactive silt (a complete closure followed by preservation) or small water reservoirs resulting in reestablishing natural water flows. Problems associated with remediation of river reservoirs resulting in flooding of vast agricultural areas also have been described. In addition, the severity of environmental and economic problems related to the remedial activities is shown to exceed any potential benefits of these activities. One of the large, highly contaminated water reservoirs that require either remediation or closure is Karachay Lake near the MAYAK Production Association in the Chelyabinsk Region of Russia where liquid radioactive waste had been deep well injected for a long period of time. Backfilling of Karachay Lake is currently in progress. It should be noted that secondary environmental problems associated with its closure are considered to be of less importance since sustaining Karachay Lake would have presented a much higher radiological risk. Another well-known highly contaminated water reservoir is the Chernobyl Nuclear Power Plant (ChNPP) Cooling Pond, decommissioning of which is planned for the near future. This study summarizes the environmental problems associated with the ChNPP Cooling Pond decommissioning.","","available","Savannah River Site (SRS), Aiken, SC (United States)","USDOE","","United States","2009-09-30T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: HEALTH PHYSICS JOURNAL","","Medium: ED","","SRNL-MS-2009-00175","DE-AC09-08SR22470","TRN: US0904452","","","2014-10-10T00:00:00Z","967384","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/967384","https://www.osti.gov/servlets/purl/967384","HEALTH PHYSICS JOURNAL","",""

Here we describe the use of these devices at the Old Rifle Uranium Mill Tailings Remedial Action (UMTRA) site. During the 7 month deployment oxidized Rifle aquifer background sediments (RABS) were deployed in previously biostimulated wells under iron reducing conditions, cell densities of known iron reducing bacteria including Geobacteraceae increased significantly showing the microbial community response to local subsurface conditions. PLFA profiles of RABS following in situ deployment were strikingly similar to those of adjacent sediment cores suggesting ISI results could be extrapolated to the native material of the test plots. Results for ISI deployed reduced sediments showed only slight changes in community composition and pointed toward the ability of the ISIs to monitor microbial community stability and response to subsurface conditions.","","","Pacific Northwest National Lab.

To insure that the resistance of HT9 to void swelling is maintained under more realistic operating conditions, this study addresses the radiation-induced microstructure of an HT9 ferritic/martensitic (F/M) steel hexagon duct that was examined following a six-year irradiation campaign of a fuel assembly in the Fast Flux Test Reactor Facility (FFTF). The calculated irradiation exposure and operating temperature of the duct location examined were ~155 dpa at ~443ºC. It was found that dislocation networks were contained predominantly a/2<111> Burgers vector. Surprisingly, for such a large irradiation dose, type a<100> interstitial loops were observed at relatively high density. Additionally, a high density of precipitation was observed. These two microstructural characteristics may have contributed to the rather low swelling level of 0.3%. It appears that the inherent swelling resistance of this alloy observed in specimens irradiated under non-varying experimental conditions is not significantly degraded compared to time-dependent variations in neutron flux-spectra, temperature and stress state that are characteristic of actual reactor components.","","","Idaho National Lab.

Three influent solutions of variable pH, Ca and carbonate concentrations that affected U(VI) aqueous and surface speciation were used under dynamic flow conditions to evaluate the effect of geochemical conditions on the rate of U(VI) desorption. The measured rate of U(VI) desorption varied with solution chemical composition that evolved as a result of thermodynamic and kinetic interactions between the influent solutions and sediment. The solution chemical composition that led to a lower equilibrium U(VI) sorption to the solid phase yielded a faster desorption rate. The experimental results were used to evaluate a multi-rate, surface complexation model (SCM) that has been proposed to describe U(VI) desorption kinetics in the Hanford sediment that contained complex sorbed U(VI) species in mass transfer limited domains. The model was modified and supplemented by including multi-rate, ion exchange reactions to describe the geochemical interactions between the solutions and sediment. With the same set of model parameters, the modified model reasonably well described the evolution of major ions and the rates of U(VI) desorption under variable geochemical and flow conditions, implying that the multi-rate SCM is an effective way to describe U(VI) desorption kinetics in subsurface sediments.","","","Pacific Northwest National Lab.

Our experiments simulated adding aqueous ammonia to the reaction products of UF{sub 6} and water in typical ADU processes. Chemical and X-ray diffraction analysis of products from the experiments are consistent with postulated chemical equilibria in which solids with structures close to that of ammonium polyuranate are formed from co-precipitation of the NH{sub 4}{sup +}(aq) cation with (previously unreported) anions of the form UO{sub 2}F{sub 3-x}(OH){sub x}{sup -}(aq). More efficient separations of solid products were obtained at NH{sub 4}OH:UF{sub 6} ratios of 19 or greater, with x closer to the value of 3 for the hypothetical formation of pure ammonium polyuranate. Supplementary experiments in the current study and a previous study in our laboratory indicated that nominal uranium concentrations of 90 mg/l in the filtrate resulting from such separations could be reduced to microgram per liter levels by batch mixing a 1-to-2.5 aqueous diluate of the filtrate with the Diphonix{reg_sign} ion exchange resin. Our study further demonstrated that reaction of the purified NH{sub 4}OH-NH{sub 4}F diluate with aqueous Ca(OH){sub 2} at 80 to 90 C could produce essentially uranium-free CaF{sub 2} and an ammonia distillate, as useful waste-conversion end products from a modified ADU process.","","","Argonne National Lab.

"CORRELATION BETWEEN RAINFALL PATTERNS AND THE WATER TABLE IN THEGENERAL SEPARATIONS AREA OF THE SAVANNAH RIVERSITE","Smith, C","11 NUCLEAR FUEL CYCLE AND FUEL MATERIALS; SAVANNAH RIVER PLANT; RAIN; MONITORING; WATER TABLES; CORRELATIONS; WATER WELLS","The objective of the study was to evaluate rainfall and water table elevation data in search of a correlation that could be used to understand and predict water elevation changes. This information will be useful in placing screen zones for future monitoring wells and operations of groundwater treatment units. Fifteen wells in the General Separations Area (GSA) at Savannah River Site were evaluated from 1986 through 2001. The study revealed that the water table does respond to rainfall with minimal delay. (Water level information was available monthly, which restricted the ability to evaluate a shorter delay period.) Water elevations were found to be related to the cumulative sum (Q-Delta Sum) of the difference between the average rainfall for a specific month and the actual rainfall for that month, calculated from an arbitrary starting point. Water table elevations could also be correlated between wells, but using the right well for correlation was very important. The strongest correlation utilized a quadratic equation that takes into account the rainfall in a specific area and the rainfall from an adjacent area that contributes through a horizontal flow. Specific values vary from well to well as a result of geometry and underground variations. R2's for the best models ranged up to 0.96. The data in the report references only GSA wells but other wells (including confined water tables) on the site have been observed to return similar water level fluctuation patterns.","","available","Savannah River Site (SRS), Aiken, SC (United States)","USDOE","","United States","2009-08-10T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: Ground Water Journal or Ground Water Monitoring and Remediation","","Medium: ED","","WSRC-MS-2009-00137","DE-AC09-08SR22470","TRN: US0903355","","","2009-12-16T00:00:00Z","963974","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/963974","https://www.osti.gov/servlets/purl/963974","Ground Water Journal or Ground Water Monitoring and Remediation","",""

The results of this study show that this processing technique is appropriate for applications in which a low free acid and moderately high U content are desired. The 7.75 L of product solution, which was over 450 g/L in U, was successfully diluted to produce about 13 L of solvent extraction feed that was 302 g/L in U with a [H{sup +}] in the range 0.8-1.2 M. A secondary goal was to test the effectiveness of this treatment for the removal of actinides from Zircaloy cladding to produce a low-level radioactive waste (LLW) cladding product. Analysis of the cladding shows that actinides are present in the cladding at a concentration of about 5000 {eta}Ci/g, which is about 50 times greater than the acceptable transuranium element limit in low level radioactive waste. It appears that the concentration of nitric acid used for this dissolution study (initial concentration 4 M, with 10 M added as the dissolution proceeded) was inadequate to completely digest the UO{sub 2} present in the spent fuel. The mass of insoluble material collected from the initial treatments with nitric acid, 340 g, was much higher than expected, and analysis of this insoluble residue showed that it contained at least 200 g U.","","available","Savannah River Site (SRS), Aiken, SC (United States)","USDOE","","United States","2009-08-07T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: Nuclear Technology","","Medium: ED","","SRNL-STI-2009-00496","DE-AC09-08SR22470","Journal ID: ISSN 0029-5450; NUTYBB; TRN: US0902920","","","2009-12-16T00:00:00Z","962686","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/962686","https://www.osti.gov/servlets/purl/962686","Nuclear Technology","",""

"Fully-coupled engineering and mesoscale simulations of thermal conductivity in UO2 fuel using an implicit multiscale approach","Tonks, Michael; Gaston, Derek; Permann, Cody; Millett, Paul; Hansen, Glen; Newman, Chris","11 NUCLEAR FUEL CYCLE AND FUEL MATERIALS; ALGORITHMS; CONVERGENCE; EVALUATION; FISSION; IRRADIATION; MICROSTRUCTURE; NUCLEAR FUELS; PERFORMANCE; SAMPLING; THERMAL CONDUCTIVITY; phase field models; reactor fuel simulation; scale bridging","Reactor fuel performance is sensitive to microstructure changes during irradiation (such as fission gas and pore formation). This study proposes an approach to capture microstructural changes in the fuel by a two-way coupling of a mesoscale phase field irradiation model to an engineering scale, finite element calculation. This work solves the multiphysics equation system at the engineering-scale in a parallel, fully-coupled, fully-implicit manner using a preconditioned Jacobian-free Newton Krylov method (JFNK). A sampling of the temperature at the Gauss points of the coarse scale is passed to a parallel sequence of mesoscale calculations within the JFNK function evaluation phase of the calculation. The mesoscale thermal conductivity is calculated in parallel, and the result is passed back to the engineering-scale calculation. As this algorithm is fully contained within the JFNK function evaluation, the mesoscale calculation is nonlinearly consistent with the engineering-scale calculation. Further, the action of the Jacobian is also consistent, so the composite algorithm provides the strong nonlinear convergence properties of Newton's method. The coupled model using INL's \bison\ code demonstrates quadratic nonlinear convergence and good parallel scalability. Initial results predict the formation of large pores in the hotter center of the pellet, but few pores on the outer circumference.

Nuclear fuels and structure materials are subject to a severe radiation environment and their properties, including thermal conductivity change significantly with time and irradiation level. In particular, the accumulation of fission products and the formation of He bubbles can decrease the heat transfer, leading to overheating of the fuel element. In this work, we use the phase-field method to study the effect of microstructural changes on thermal conductivity. We developed a phase-field model to simulate the He bubble formation and growth in a single/polycrystalline material with defects. The model takes into account the generation of gas atoms and defects, gas atom diffusivity inhomogeneity, gas atom segregation, and gas bubble nucleation. With the model, we simulated the gas bubble and temperature evolution, and calculated the effect of gas bubble volume fraction on effective thermal conductivity.","","","Pacific Northwest National Lab.

This re-consideration follows with intense developmental programs for both fuel and reactor design. One of the two leading candidates for next generation fast reactor fuel is metal alloys, resulting primarily from the successes achieved in the 1960s to early 1990s with both the experimental breeding reactor-II and the fast flux test facility. The goal of the current program is to develop and qualify a nuclear fuel system that performs all of the functions of a conventional, fast-spectrum nuclear fuel while destroying recycled actinides, thereby closing the nuclear fuel cycle. In order to meet this goal, the program must develop efficient and safe fuel fabrication processes designed for remote operation. This paper provides an overview of advanced casting processes investigated in the past, and the development of a gaseous diffusion calculation that demonstrates how straightforward process parameter modification can mitigate the loss of volatile minor actinides in the metal alloy melt.","","","Idaho National Lab.

The sediment was collected from the US DOE Hanford site, and contained uranyl precipitates in a form of Na-boltwoodite within the mm-sized granitic lithic fragments in the sediment. Microbial reduction was investigated in a culture of a dissimilatory metal-reducing bacterium (DMRB), Shewanella oneidensis strain MR-1, in bicarbonate solutions at pH 6.8 buffered by PIPES. Measurements of uranium concentration, speciation, and valence in aqueous and solid phases indicated that microbial reduction of intragrain U(VI) proceeded by two mechanisms: 1) sequentially coupled dissolution of intragrain uranyl precipitates, diffusion of dissolved U(VI) out of intragrain regions, and microbial reduction of dissolved U(VI); and 2) U(VI) reduction in the intragrain regions by soluble, diffusible biogenic reductants. The bioreduction rate in the first pathway was over 3 orders of magnitude slower than that in comparable aqueous solutions containing aqueous U(VI) only. The slower bioreduction rate was attributed to: 1) the release of calcium from the desorption/dissolution of calcium-containing minerals in the sediment, which subsequently altered U(VI) aqueous speciation and slowed U(VI) bioreduction and 2) alternative electron transfer pathways that reduced U(VI) in the intragrain regions and changed its dissolution and solubility behavior. The results implied that the overall rate of microbial reduction of intragrain U(VI) will be influenced by the reactive mass transfer of U(VI) and biogenic reductants within intragrain regions, and geochemical reactions controlling major ion concentrations that affect U(VI) aqueous speciation and microbial activity.","","","Pacific Northwest National Lab.

This paper presents an evaluation of metallic alloy fuels. Fast reactor development programs have been conducted over the past five decades. Early U.S. fast reactor developers originally favored metal alloy fuel due to its high fissile density and compatibility with sodium. As metal alloy fuels continued to be developed it was discovered that low smear density allowed for the fuel to operate to much higher burnup. The goal of fuel development programs for future fast reactors is to develop and qualify for operation, a nuclear fuel system that performs all of the functions of a conventional fast spectrum nuclear fuel while destroying recycled actinides. This fuel would provide a mechanism for closure of the nuclear fuel cycle.

The X501 subassembly contained two metallic fuel elements loaded with relatively small quantities of americium and neptunium. Interest in the behavior of minor actinides (MA) during fuel irradiation has prompted further examination of existing X501 data, and generation of new data where needed in support of the U.S. waste transmutation effort. The X501 experiment is one of the few minor actinide-bearing fuel irradiation tests conducted worldwide and knowledge can be gained by understanding the changes in fuel behavior due to addition of MA’s. Of primary interest are the affect of the MA’s on fuel-cladding-chemical-interaction, and the redistribution behavior of americium. The quantity of helium gas release from the fuel and any effects of helium on fuel performance are also of interest. It must be stressed that information presented at this time is based on the limited PIE conducted in 1995-1996, and currently represents a set of observations rather than a complete understanding of fuel behavior. This paper provides a summary of the X501 fabrication, characterization, irradiation, and post irradiation examination.","","","Idaho National Lab.

The first analysis, implemented by the investment worth system (IWS), uses Monte Carlo simulation to integrate a wide spectrum of uncertain and varied components to a relative frequency histogram for net present value of the exploration investment, which is converted to a risk-adjusted value (RAV). Iterative rerunning of the IWS enables the mapping of the relationship of RAV to magnitude of exploration expenditure, X. The second major analysis uses RAV vs. X maps to identify that subset (portfolio) of areas that maximizes the RAV of the firm's multiyear exploration budget. The IWS, which is demonstrated numerically, consists of six components based on the geologic description of a hypothetical basin and project area (PA) and a mix of hypothetical and actual conditions of an unidentified area. The geology is quantified and processed by Bayesian belief networks to produce the geology-based inputs required by the IWS. An exploration investment of $60 M produced a highly skewed distribution of net present value (NPV), having mean and median values of $4,160 M and $139 M, respectively. For hypothetical mining firm Minex, the RAV of the exploration investment of $60 M is only $110.7 M. An RAV that is less than 3% of mean NPV reflects the aversion by Minex to risk as well as the magnitude of risk implicit to the highly skewed NPV distribution and the probability of 0.45 for capital loss. Potential benefits of initiating exploration of a portfolio of areas, as contrasted with one area, include increased marginal productivity of exploration as well as reduced probability for nondiscovery. For an exogenously determined multiyear exploration budget, a conceptual framework for portfolio optimization is developed based on marginal RAV exploration products for candidate PAs. PORTFOLIO, a software developed to implement optimization, allocates exploration to PAs so that the RAV of the exploration budget is maximized. Moreover, PORTFOLIO provides a means to examine the impact of magnitude of budget on the composition of the exploration portfolio and the optimum allocation of exploration to PAs that comprise the portfolio. Using fictitious data for five PAs, a numerical demonstration is provided of the use of PORTFOLIO to identify those PAs that comprise the optimum exploration portfolio and to optimally allocate the multiyear budget across portfolio PAs.","","","","","","United States","2009-06-15T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: Natural Resources Research (New York, N.Y.); Journal Volume: 18; Journal Issue: 2; Other Information: DOI: 10.1007/s11053-009-9092-2; Copyright (c) 2009 International Association for Mathematical Geology; http://www.springer-ny.com; Country of input: International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA)","","Medium: X; Size: page(s) 109-136","","","","Journal ID: ISSN 1520-7439; TRN: US09K0519101895","10.1007/S11053-009-9092-2","","2010-06-03T00:00:00Z","21238854","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/21238854","","Natural Resources Research (New York, N.Y.)","2","18"

Between 1983 and 1992, the SMF was used in support of the Department of Energy (DOE)-funded Fast Flux Test Facility (FFTF) Materials Open Test Assembly (MOTA) program. In this program, metallurgical specimens were irradiated in FFTF and then sent to SMF for processing and storage in two cabinets. This effort was abruptly ended in early 1990s due to programmatic shifts within the DOE, leaving many specimens unexamined. In recent years, these specimens have become of high value to new DOE programs. Pacific Northwest National Laboratory (PNNL) was tasked with retrieving specimens from one of the cabinets in support of fuel clad and duct development for the Advanced Fuel Cycle Initiative. Cesium contamination of the cell and failure of the overhead crane system utilized for opening the cabinets prevented PNNL from using the built-in hot cell equipment to gain access to the cabinets. PNNL designed and tested a lifting device to fit through a standard 10 inch diameter mechanical manipulator port in the SMF South Cell wall. The tool was successfully deployed in June 2008 with the support of Washington Closure Hanford.","","","Pacific Northwest National Lab.

Dominant U(VI) silicate precipitates (boltwoodite and uranophane) were present in shallow-depth sediments (15-16 m bgs). In the intermediate depth sediments (20-25 m bgs), adsorbed U(VI) phases dominated but small amounts of surface precipitates consisting of polynuclear U(VI) surface complex were also identified. The deep depth sediments (> 28 m bgs) showed no signs of contact with tank wastes containing Hanford-derived U(VI), but natural uranium solid phases were observed. Most of the U(VI) was preferentially associated with the silt and clay size fractions and showed strong correlation with Ca, especially for the precipitated U(VI) silicate phase in the shallow depth sediments. Because U(VI) silicate precipitates dominate the U(VI) phases in the shallow depth sediments, macroscopic (bi)carbonate leaching should result in U(VI) releases from both desorption and dissolution processes. Having several different U(VI) surface phases in the Hanford contaminated sediments indicates that the U(VI) release mechanism could be complicated and that detailed characterization of the sediments would be needed to estimate U(VI) fate and transport in vadose zone.","","","Pacific Northwest National Lab.

Uranium-molybdenum alloy foils are currently under investigation for the possible conversion of high-power research reactors to accommodate the use of low-enriched uranium fuel. Understanding basic microstructural behavior of these foils is an important consideration in determining the impact of fabrication processes and in anticipating performance of the foils in a reactor. Average grain diameter decreased with increasing molybdenum content, while the degree of mechanical deformation banding increased with increasing molybdenum content. A lattice parameter, which provided information on stress-corrosion cracking behavior, decreased with increasing molybdenum content, and no significant degree of crystallographic ordering was caused by processing and post-processing conditions employed in this study.

The properties and hence stability of uraninite are dependent on its size, structure, and composition. In this study, the local-, intermediate-, and long-range molecular-scale structure of nanoscale uraninite produced by Shewanella oneidensis strain MR-1 was investigated using EXAFS, SR-based powder diffraction and TEM. The uraninite products were found to be structurally homologous with stoichiometric UO{sub 2} under all conditions considered. Significantly, there was no evidence for lattice strain of the biogenic uraninite nanoparticles. The fresh nanoparticles were found to exhibit a well-ordered interior core of diameter ca. 1.3 nm and an outer region of thickness ca {approx}0.6 nm in which the structure is locally distorted. The lack of nanoparticle strain and structural homology with stoichiometric UO{sub 2} suggests that established thermodynamic parameters for the latter material are an appropriate starting point to model the behavior of nanobiogenic uraninite.

Radiation damage is modeled by the creation of Frenkel pair defects and helium impurity atoms. A multi-dimensional cluster size distribution function allows independent evolution of the vacancy and helium content of cavities, distinguishing voids and bubbles. A model with sessile cavities and no cluster-cluster coalescence can result in a bimodal final cavity size distribution with coexistence of small, high-pressure bubbles and large, low-pressure voids. A model that includes unhindered cavity diffusion and coalescence ultimately removes the small helium bubbles from the system, leaving only large voids. The terminal void density is also reduced and the incubation period and terminal swelling rate can be greatly altered by cavity coalescence. Temperature-dependent trapping of voids/bubbles by precipitates and alterations in void surface diffusion from adsorbed impurities and internal gas pressure may give rise to intermediate swelling behavior through their effects on cavity mobility and coalescence.","","","Lawrence Livermore National Lab.

The kinetics of the reaction depend on the relative concentrations of the reaction components and are accelerated at higher temperatures. The reaction does not occur unless conditions are acidic. Analysis of the X-ray absorption fine structure spectroscopic data is consistent with a pseudo-octahedral geometry and the linear Tc-N-O bond typical of technetium nitrosyl compounds, and electron spin resonance spectroscopy is consistent with a d{sup 5} Tc(II) nitrosyl complex. The nitrosyl source is generally AHA, but it may be augmented by some products of the reaction with nitric acid. The resulting low-valency trans-aquonitrosyl(diacetohydroxamic)-technetium(II) complex ([Tc{sup II}(NO)(AHA){sub 2}H{sub 2}O]{sup +}, 1) is highly soluble in water, extremely hydrophilic, and is not extracted by tri-n-butylphosphate in a dodecane diluent. Its extraction properties are not pH-dependent: potentiometric-spectrophotometric titration studies indicate a single species from pH 4 down to -0.6 (calculated). This molecule is resistant to oxidation by H{sub 2}O{sub 2}, even at high pH, and can undergo substitution to form other technetium nitrosyl complexes. The potential formation of 1 during reprocessing may strongly impact the fate of technetium in the nuclear fuel cycle.","","","SLAC National Accelerator Lab., Menlo Park, CA (United States)","USDOE","","United States","2009-05-18T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: Inorg.

However, our results were not consistent with this hypothesis. Analysis of &gt;100 sediment and suspended sediment samples collected adjacent to and downstream from uranium source areas indicated that uranium levels in the majority of the samples were not elevated above background. Samples collected within 50 m of a known waste disposal site were subjected to detailed geochemical characterization. Uranium in these samples was found to be highly soluble; treatment with synthetic pore water for 24 h caused dissolution of 10-50% of total uranium in the samples. Equilibrium uranium concentrations in pore water were &gt;4.0 mg/L and were sustained in repeated wetting events, effectively depleting soluble uranium from the solid phase. The dissolution rate of uranium appeared to be controlled by solid-phase diffusion of uranium from within uranium-bearing mineral particles. X-ray adsorption spectroscopy indicated the presence of a soluble uranyl silicate, and possibly a uranyl phosphate. These phases were exhausted in transported sediment suggesting that uranium was readily mobilized from sediments in the Upper Puerco watershed and transported in the dissolved load. These results could have significance for uranium risk assessment as well as mining waste management and cleanup efforts.","","","SLAC National Accelerator Lab., Menlo Park, CA (United States)","USDOE","","United States","2009-05-14T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: Environ.

The experimentally-observed pre-melting transition occurred for all five cases. For all the potentials studied, dynamic defect annealing is highly effective and is accompanied by replacement events on the anion sublattice. The primary damage state after ~15 ps consists of isolated Frenkel pairs and interstitial and vacancy clusters of various sizes. The average displacement energy varies from ~28 to ~83 eV and the number of Frenkel pairs is different by a factor of three depending on the choice of potential. The size and spatial distribution of vacancy and interstitial clusters is drastically different for the potentials studied. The results provide statistics of defect production. They point to a pressing need to determine defect formation, migration and binding energies in UO2 from first principles and to develop reliable potentials based on this data for simulating microstructural evolution in nuclear fuel under operating conditions.","","","Pacific Northwest National Lab.

In this study, the impact of major additive components on surface and interfacial tensions for organic mixtures and wastewater was investigated. Organic mixture and wastewater compositions are based upon carbon tetrachloride (CT) mixtures released at the Hanford site, where CT was discharged simultaneously with dibutyl butyl phosphonate (DBBP), tributyl phosphate (TBP), dibutyl phosphate (DBP), and a machining lard oil (LO). A considerable amount of wastewater consisting primarily of nitrates and metal salts was also discharged. The tension values measured in this study revealed that the addition of these additive components caused a significant lowering of the interfacial tension with water or wastewater and the surface tension of the wastewater phase in equilibrium with the organic mixtures, compared to pure CT, but had minimal effect on the surface tension of the NAPL itself. These results lead to large differences in spreading coefficients for several mixtures, where the additives caused both a higher (more spreading) initial spreading coefficient and a lower (less spreading) equilibrium spreading coefficient. This indicates that if these mixtures migrate into uncontaminated areas, they will tend to spread quickly, but form a higher residual NAPL saturation after equilibrium, as compared to pure CT. Over time, CT likely volatilizes more rapidly than other components in the originally disposed mixtures and the lard oil and phosphates would become more concentrated in the remaining NAPL, resulting in a lower interfacial tension for the mixture. Spreading coefficients are expected to increase and perhaps change the equilibrated organic mixtures from nonspreading to spreading in water-wetting porous media. These results show that the behavior of organic chemical mixtures should be accounted for in numerical flow and transport models.","","","Pacific Northwest National Lab.

This study developed a new analytical methodology simulating the Sjoestrand method, which allows comparing the experimental and analytical reaction rates and the obtained subcriticality levels. In this methodology, the reaction rate is calculated due to a single neutron pulse using MCNP/MCNPX computer code or any other neutron transport code that explicitly simulates the delayed fission neutrons. The calculation simulates a single neutron pulse over a long time period until the delayed neutron contribution to the reaction rate is vanished. The obtained reaction rate is then superimposed to itself, with respect to the time, to simulate the repeated pulse operation until the asymptotic level of the reaction rate, set by the delayed neutrons, is achieved. The superimposition of the pulse to itself was calculated by a simple C computer program. A parallel version of the C program is used due to the large amount of data being processed, e.g. by the Message Passing Interface (MPI). The analytical results of this new calculation methodology have shown an excellent agreement with the experimental data available from the YALINA-Booster facility of Belarus. This methodology can be used to calculate Bell and Glasstone spatial correction factor.","","","Argonne National Lab.

Although mechanical properties take on a secondary effect during irradiation, an understanding of the alloy behavior during fabrication and the effects of irradiation on the integrity of the fuel is essential. In general, the microhardness, yield strength, Young’s modulus, and ultimate tensile strength improved with increasing Mo content. Microhardness measurements were very sensitive to local composition, while the failure mode was significantly controlled by the impurity concentration of the alloy, especially carbon.

A number of thermal hydraulic challenges for GFR design are pointed out as the designers strive to accommodate cooling of the high power density core of a fast reactor by a gas with its inherently low heat transfer capability, in particular under post LOCA events when system pressure is lost and when reliance on passive decay heat removal is emphasized. Although it is possible to design a S-CO2 cooled GFR that can survive LOCA by cooling the core through natural circulating loops between the core and elevated emergency cooling heat exchangers, it is not an attractive approach because of various bypass paths that can, depending on break location, degrade core cooling. Moreover, natural circulation gas loops can operate in deteriorated heat transfer regimes with substantial reduction of heat transfer coefficient: as low as 30% of forced convection values, and data and correlations in these regimes carry large uncertainties. Therefore, reliable battery powered blowers for post-LOCA decay heat removal (DHR) that provide flow in well defined regimes with low uncertainty, and can be easily over-designed to accommodate bypass flows were selected. The results confirm that a GFR with such a DHR system and negative coolant void worth can withstand LOCA with and without scram as well as loss of electrical load without exceeding core temperature and turbomachinery overspeed limits.","","","Idaho National Lab.

The azolium-based ILs experienced the greatest change in appearance, but these ILs were chemically more stable to gamma radiation than some of the other classes of ILs tested, due to the presence of aromatic electrons in the azolium ring. All the ILs exhibited a decrease in their conductivity and electrochemical window (at least 1.1 V), both of which could affect the utility of ILs in electrochemical processing.

Exhibiting an intermediate redox potential, Tc is highly mobile in its anionic, oxidized state [Tc(VII)O4-]; and less mobile as a poorly soluble oxyhydroxide precipitate [Tc(IV)O2•nH2O] in its reduced state. Here we investigate the potential for oxidation of Tc(IV) that was heterogeneously reduced by reaction with biogenic Fe(II) in two sediments differing in mineralogy and aggregation state (FRC, RG). Both sediments contained Fe(III) and Mn(III/IV) as redox active phases, but FRC also contained mass-dominant Fe-phyllosilicates of different types. Biogenic Tc(IV)O2•nH2O was oxidized in anoxic, but unreduced RG and FRC sediments through redox interaction with Mn(III/IV) oxides. Bioreduction by Shewanella putrefaciens CN32 dissolved Mn(III/IV) oxides and generated biogenic Fe(II) that was reactive with Tc(VII) in heat-killed, bioreduced sediment. Biogenic Fe(II) in the FRC exceeded that in RG by a factor of two. More rapid reduction rates were observed in the RG that had lower biogenic Fe(II), and less particle aggregation. EXAFS measurements indicated that the primary reduction product was a TcO2-like phase in both sediments. Redox product Tc(IV) oxidized rapidly and completely in RG when contacted with air. Oxidation, in contrast, was slow and incomplete in the FRC, in spite of similar molecular speciation to RG. X-ray microprobe, electron microprobe, x-ray absorption spectroscopy, and micro x-ray diffraction were applied to the whole sediment and isolated Tc-contained particles. These analyses revealed that non-oxidizable Tc(IV) in the FRC existed as complexes with octahedral Fe(III) within intra-grain domains of 50-100 µm-sized, Fe-containing micas presumptively identified as celadonite. The markedly slower oxidation rates in FRC as compared to RG were attributed to mass-transfer-limited migration of O2 into intra-aggregate and intraparticle domains where Tc(IV) existed; and the formation of unique, oxidation-resistant, intragrain Tc(IV)-Fe(III) molecular species.","","","Pacific Northwest National Lab.

Here we investigate the potential for oxidation of Tc(IV) that was heterogeneously reduced by reaction with biogenic Fe(II) in two sediments differing in mineralogy and aggregation state; unconsolidated Pliocene-age fluvial sediment from the upper Ringold (RG) Formation at the Hanford Site and a clay-rich saprolite from the Field Research Center (FRC) background site on the Oak Ridge Site. Both sediments contained Fe(III) and Mn(III/IV) as redox active phases, but FRC also contained mass-dominant Fe-phyllosilicates of different types. Shewanella putrefaciens CN32 reduced Mn(III/IV) oxides and generated Fe(II) that was reactive with Tc(VII) in heat-killed, bioreduced sediment. After bioreduction and heat-killing, biogenic Fe(II) in the FRC exceeded that in RG by a factor of two. More rapid reduction rates were observed in the RG that had lower biogenic Fe(II), and less particle aggregation. EXAFS measurements indicated that the primary reduction product was a TcO{sub 2}-like phase in both sediments. The biogenic redox product Tc(IV) oxidized rapidly and completely in RG when contacted with air. Oxidation, in contrast, was slow and incomplete in the FRC, in spite of similar molecular scale speciation of Tc compared to RG. X-ray microprobe, electron microprobe, X-ray absorption spectroscopy, and micro X-ray diffraction were applied to the whole sediment and isolated Tc-containing particles. These analyses revealed that non-oxidizable Tc(IV) in the FRC existed as complexes with octahedral Fe(III) within intra-grain domains of 50-100 {micro}m-sized, Fe-containing micas presumptively identified as celadonite. The markedly slower oxidation rates in FRC as compared to RG were attributed to mass-transfer-limited migration of O{sub 2} into intra-aggregate and intraparticle domains where Tc(IV) existed; and the formation of unique, oxidation-resistant, intragrain Tc(IV)-Fe(III) molecular species.","","","Argonne National Lab.

The most commonly used technique for performing active interrogation is to use an electronic neutron generator as the probe radiation source. Exploiting the unique operating characteristics of these devices, including their monoenergetic neutron emissions and their ability to operate in pulsed modes, presents a number of options for performing prompt and delayed signature analyses using both photon and neutron sensors. A review of literature in this area shows multiple applications of the active neutron interrogation technique for performing nuclear nonproliferation measurements. Some examples include measuring the plutonium content of spent fuel, assaying plutonium residue in spent fuel hull claddings, assaying plutonium in aqueous fuel reprocessing process streams, and assaying nuclear fuel reprocessing facility waste streams to detect and quantify fissile material. This paper discusses the historical use of this technique and examines its context within the scope and challenges of next-generation nuclear fuel cycles and advanced concept nuclear fuel cycle facilities.","","","","","","United States","2009-03-10T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: AIP Conference Proceedings; Journal Volume: 1099; Journal Issue: 1; Conference: CAARI 2008: 12. international conference on application of accelerators in research and industry, Fort Worth, TX (United States), 10-15 Aug 2008; Other Information: DOI: 10.1063/1.3120173; (c) 2009 American Institute of Physics; Country of input: International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA)","","Medium: X; Size: page(s) 851-856","","","","Journal ID: ISSN 0094-243X; APCPCS; TRN: US09A6720037035","10.1063/1.3120173","","2010-06-03T00:00:00Z","21289667","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/21289667","","AIP Conference Proceedings","1","1099"

Ingestion intake rates and associated dose rates were estimated from cotton gloves worn by sample recovery personnel and from wipe test samples from the interior of vehicles perforated with large caliber DU munitions. The mean DU inhalation intake rate for level II personnel ranged from 0.447 mg h-1 based on breathing zone monitor data (in and around a perforated vehicle) to 14.5 mg h-1 based on area monitor data (in a perforated vehicle).

The sampling strategy was designed to (1) optimize the performance of the samplers and maintain their integrity in the extreme environment created during perforation of an armored vehicle by a DU penetrator, (2) collect aerosols as a function of time post-impact, and (3) obtain size-classified samples for analysis of chemical composition, particle morphology, and solubility in lung fluid. This paper describes the experimental setup and sampling methodologies used to achieve these objectives. Custom-designed arrays of sampling heads were secured to the inside of the target in locations approximating the breathing zones of the vehicle commander, loader, gunner, and driver. Each array was designed to support nine filter cassettes and nine cascade impactors mounted with quick-disconnect fittings. Shielding and sampler placement strategies were used to minimize sampler loss caused by the penetrator impact and the resulting fragments of eroded penetrator and perforated armor. A cyclone train was used to collect larger quantities of DU aerosol for chemical composition and solubility. A moving filter sample was used to obtain semicontinuous samples for depleted uranium concentration determination. Control for the air samplers was provided by five remotely located valve control and pressure monitoring units located inside and around the test vehicle. These units were connected to a computer interface chassis and controlled using a customized LabVIEW engineering computer control program. The aerosol sampling arrays and control systems for the Capstone study provided the needed aerosol samples for physicochemical analysis, and the resultant data were used for risk assessment of exposure to DU aerosol.","","","Pacific Northwest National Lab.

Vigorous oxidation of the DU particles and fragments creates an aerosol of DU oxide particles and DU particle agglomerations combined with target materials. Aerosols from the Capstone DU aerosol study, in which vehicles were perforated by DU penetrators, were evaluated for their oxidation states using X-ray diffraction (XRD) and particle morphologies using scanning electron microscopy/energy dispersive spectrometry (SEM/EDS). The oxidation state of a DU aerosol is important as it offers a clue to its solubility in lung fluids. The XRD analysis showed that the aerosols evaluated were a combination primarily of U3O8 (insoluble) and UO3 (relatively more soluble) phases, though intermediate phases resembling U4O9 and other oxides were prominent in some samples. Analysis of particle residues in the micrometer-size range by SEM/EDS provided microstructural information such as phase composition and distribution, fracture morphology, size distribution, and material homogeneity. Observations from SEM analysis show a wide variability in the shapes of the DU particles. Some of the larger particles appear to have been fractured (perhaps as a result of abrasion and comminution); others were spherical, occasionally with dendritic or lobed surface structures. Amorphous conglomerates containing metals other than uranium were also common, especially with the smallest particle sizes. A few samples seemed to contain small chunks of nearly pure uranium metal, which were verified by EDS to have a higher uranium content exceeding that expected for uranium oxides. Results of the XRD and SEM/EDS analyses were used in other studies described in this issue of The Journal of Health Physics to interpret the results of lung solubility studies and in selecting input parameters for dose assessments.","","","Pacific Northwest National Lab.

ABR is a sodium-cooled fast reactor that is used to consume transuranic elements resulting from the reprocessing of light water reactor spent nuclear fuel. ABR-1000 [1000 MW(thermal)] is a fast reactor concept created at Argonne National Laboratory to be used as a reference concept for various future trade-offs. ABR-1000 meets the GNEP goals although it uses what is considered base sodium fast reactor technology for its systems and components. One of the considerations of any fast reactor plant concept is the ability to perform fuel-handling operations with new and spent fast reactor fuel. The transmutation fuel proposed as the ABR fuel has a very little experience base, and thus, this paper investigates a fuel-handling concept and potential issues of handling fast reactor fuel containing minor actinides. In this study, two thermal analyses supporting a conceptual design study on the ABR-1000 fuel-handling system were carried out. One analysis investigated passive dry spent fuel storage, and the other analysis investigated a fresh fuel shipping cask. Passive dry storage can be made suitable for the ABR-1000 spent fuel storage with sodium-bonded metal fuel. The thermal analysis shows that spent fast reactor fuel with a decay heat of 2 kW or less can be stored passively in a helium atmosphere. The 2-kW value seems to be a reasonable and practical level, and a combination of reasonably-sized in-sodium storage followed by passive dry storage could be a candidate for spent fuel storage for the next-generation sodium-cooled reactor with sodium-bonded metal fuel. Requirements for the shipping casks for minor actinide-bearing fuel with a high decay heat level are also discussed in this paper. The shipping cask for fresh sodium-cooled-reactor fuel should be a dry type to reduce the reaction between residual moisture on fresh fuel and the sodium coolant. The cladding temperature requirement is maintained below the creep temperature limit to avoid any damage before core installation. The thermal analysis shows that a helium gas-filled cask can accommodate ABR-1000 fresh minor actinide-bearing fuel with 700-W decay heat. The above analysis results revealed the overall requirement for minor actinide-bearing metal fuel handling. The information is thought to be helpful in the design of the ABR-1000 and future sodium-cooled-reactor fuel-handling system.","","","Argonne National Lab.

The advanced burner reactor (ABR) is a fast reactor concept which supports the GNEP fuel cycle system. Since the integral fast reactor (IFR) and advanced liquid-metal reactor (ALMR) projects were terminated in 1994, there has been no major development on sodium-cooled fast reactors in the United States. Therefore, in support of the GNEP fast reactor program, the history of sodium-cooled reactor development was reviewed to support the initiation of this technology within the United States and to gain an understanding of the technology gaps that may still remain for sodium fast reactor technology. The fuel-handling system is a key element of any fast reactor design. The major functions of this system are to receive, test, store, and then load fresh fuel into the core; unload from the core; then clean, test, store, and ship spent fuel. Major requirements are that the system must be reliable and relatively easy to maintain. In addition, the system should be designed so that it does not adversely impact plant economics from the viewpoints of capital investment or plant operations. In this gap analysis, information on fuel-handling operating experiences in the following reactor plants was carefully reviewed: EBR-I, SRE, HNPF, Fermi, SEFOR, FFTF, CRBR, EBR-II, DFR, PFR, Rapsodie, Phenix, Superphenix, KNK, SNR-300, Joyo, and Monju. The results of this evaluation indicate that a standardized fuel-handling system for a commercial fast reactor is yet to be established. However, in the past sodium-cooled reactor plants, most major fuel-handling components-such as the rotatable plug, in-vessel fuel-handling machine, ex-vessel fuel transportation cask, ex-vessel sodium-cooled storage, and cleaning stations-have accumulated satisfactory construction and operation experiences. In addition, two special issues for future development are described in this report: large capacity interim storage and transuranic-bearing fuel handling.","","","Argonne National Lab.

Aerosol particle size distribution is an important parameter that influences aerosol transport and deposition processes as well as the dosimetry of the inhaled particles. These aerosols were collected on cascade impactor substrates using a pre-established time sequence following the firing event to analyze the uranium concentration and particle size of the aerosols as a function of time. The impactor substrates were analyzed using beta spectrometry, and the derived uranium content of each served as input to the evaluation of particle size distributions. Activity median aerodynamic diameters (AMADs) of the particle size distributions were evaluated using unimodal and bimodal models. The particle size data from the impactor measurements was quite variable. Most size distributions measured in the test based on activity had bimodal size distributions with a small particle size mode in the range of between 0.2 and 1.2 um and a large size mode between 2 and 15 um. In general, the evolution of particle size over time showed an overall decrease of average particle size from AMADs of 5 to 10 um shortly after perforation to around 1 um at the end of the 2-hr sampling period. The AMADs generally decreased over time because of settling. Additionally, the median diameter of the larger size mode decreased with time.

Combatant commanders of the U. S. Army carefully weigh risks of casualties before implementing battlefield actions using an established paradigm that take these risks into consideration. As a result of the inclusion of depleted uranium (DU) anti-armor ammunition in the conventional (non-nuclear) weapons arsenal, the potential for exposure to DU aerosols and its associated chemical and radiological effects becomes an element of the commanders’ risk assessment. The Capstone DU Aerosol Study measured the range of likely DU oxide aerosol concentrations created inside a combat vehicle perforated with a DU munition, and the Capstone Human Health Risk Assessment (HHRA) estimated the associated doses and calculated risks. This paper focuses on the development of a scientific approach to adapt the risks from DU’s non uniform dose distribution within the body using the current U.S. Department of Defense (DoD) radiation risk management approach. The approach developed equates the Radiation Exposure Status (RES) categories to the estimated radiological risks of DU and makes use of the Capstone-developed Renal Effects Group (REG) as a measure of chemical risk from DU intake. Recommendations are provided for modifying Army guidance and policy in order to better encompass the potential risks from DU aerosol inhalation during military operations.","","","Pacific Northwest National Lab.

These aerosols were collected and characterized, and the data were subsequently used to assess human health risks to personnel exposed to DU aerosols. The DU content of each aerosol sample was first quantified by radioanalytical methods, and selected samples, primarily those from the cyclone separator grit chambers, were analyzed radiochemically. Deposition occurred inside the vehicles as particles settled on interior surfaces. Settling rates of uranium from the aerosols were evaluated using filter cassette samples that collected aerosol as total mass over eight sequential time intervals. A moving filter was used to collect aerosol samples over time particularly within the first minute after the shot. The results demonstrate that the peak uranium concentration in the aerosol occurred in the first 10 s, and the concentration decreased in the Abrams tank shots to about 50% within 1 min and to less than 2% 30 min after perforation. In the Bradley vehicle, the initial (and maximum) uranium concentration was lower than those observed in the Abrams tank and decreased more slowly. Uranium mass concentrations in the aerosols as a function of particle size were evaluated using samples collected in the cyclone samplers, which collected aerosol continuously for 2 h post perforation.

These aerosol samples generated by the perforation of armored combat vehicles were used to characterize the depleted uranium (DU) source term for the subsequent human health risk assessment (HHRA) of Capstone aerosols. Establishing a calibration curve between beta activity measurements and uranium mass measurements is straightforward if the uranium isotopes are in equilibrium with their immediate short-lived, beta-emitting progeny. For DU samples collected during the Capstone study, it was determined that the equilibrium between the uranium isotopes and their immediate short lived, beta-emitting progeny had been disrupted when penetrators had perforated target vehicles. Adjustments were made to account for the disrupted equilibrium and for wall losses in the aerosol samplers. Correction factors for the disrupted equilibrium ranged from 0.16 to 1, and the wall loss correction factors ranged from 1 to 1.92.","","","Pacific Northwest National Lab.

The Capstone study consisted of two components: 1) generating, sampling and characterizing DU aerosols by firing at and perforating combat vehicles and 2) applying the source-term quantities and characteristics of the aerosols to the evaluation of doses and risks. This paper reviews the background of the study including the bases for the study, previous reviews of DU particles and health assessments from DU used by the U.S. military, the objectives of the study components, the participants and oversight teams, and the types of exposures it was intended to evaluate.

A prismatic thermal High Temperature Gas Reactor (HTGR) and the novel concept of quadruple isotropic (QUADRISO) coated particles, designed at the Argonne National Laboratory, have been used for the study. In absorbing QUADRISO particles, a burnable poison layer surrounds the central fuel kernel to flatten the reactivity curve as a function of time. At the beginning of life, the fuel in the QUADRISO particles is hidden from neutrons, since they get absorbed in the burnable poison before they reach the fuel kernel. Only when the burnable poison depletes, neutrons start streaming into the fuel kernel inducing fission reactions and compensating the fuel depletion of ordinary TRISO particles. In fertile QUADRISO particles, the absorber layer is replaced by natural thorium with the purpose of flattening the excess of reactivity by the thorium resonances and producing {sup 233}U. The above configuration has been compared with a configuration where fissile (neptunium-plutonium oxide from Light Water Reactors irradiated fuel) and fertile (natural thorium oxide) fuels are homogeneously mixed in the kernel of ordinary TRISO particles. For the {sup 233}U utilization, the core has been equipped with europium oxide absorbing QUADRISO particles.","","","Argonne National Lab.

"Enhancing BWR Proliferation Resistance Fuel with Minor Actinides","Chang, Gray S","11 NUCLEAR FUEL CYCLE AND FUEL MATERIALS; ACTINIDES; ATOMS; BOILING; BURNUP; COOLANTS; CRITICALITY; FUEL CYCLE; FUEL PINS; ISOTOPE RATIO; ISOTOPES; NUCLEAR ENERGY; PROLIFERATION; SPENT FUELS; STORAGE; TRANSMUTATION; WASTES; WATER; minor actinides; resistance fuel","To reduce spent fuel for storage and enhance the proliferation resistance for the intermediate-term, there are two major approaches (a) increase the discharged spent fuel burnup in the advanced light water reactor- LWR (Gen-III Plus), which not only can reduce the spent fuel for storage, but also increase the 238Pu isotopes ratio to enhance the proliferation resistance, and (b) use of transuranic nuclides (237Np and 241Am) in the high burnup fuel, which can drastically increase the proliferation resistance isotope ratio of 238Pu/Pu. For future advanced nuclear systems, minor actinides (MA) are viewed more as a resource to be recycled, and transmuted to less hazardous and possibly more useful forms, rather than simply disposed of as a waste stream in an expensive repository facility. As a result, MAs play a much larger part in the design of advanced systems and fuel cycles, not only as additional sources of useful energy, but also as direct contributors to the reactivity control of the systems into which they are incorporated. In the study, a typical boiling water reactor (BWR) fuel unit lattice cell model with UO2 fuel pins will be used to investigate the effectiveness of minor actinide reduction approach (MARA) for enhancing proliferation resistance and improving the fuel cycle performance in the intermediate-term goal for future nuclear energy systems. To account for the water coolant density variation from the bottom (0.76 g/cm3) to the top (0.35 g/cm3) of the core, the axial coolant channel and fuel pin were divided to 24 nodes. The MA transmutation characteristics at different elevations were compared and their impact on neutronics criticality discussed. The concept of MARA, which involves the use of transuranic nuclides (237Np and/or 241Am), significantly increases the 238Pu/Pu ratio for proliferation resistance, as well as serves as a burnable absorber to hold-down the initial excess reactivity. It is believed that MARA can play an important role in atoms for peace and the intermediate-term of nuclear energy reconnaissance.","","","Idaho National Lab.

Though the engineered barrier systems are expected to last a very long time after the repository is closed, they may gradually deteriorate and eventually lose integrity. consequently, water could contact the waste, dissolve it, and carry radionuclides out of the repository. Under the chemical environment in the vicinity of the waste form, 237Np(V) is one of the most soluble radionuclides and is most likely to be carried away from the repository. Because of its long half-life and high mobility, it is projected that, in the proposed Yucca Mountain Repository, the fractional dose attributed to 237Np will increase to 67% of the total dose in 75000 years [1]. As a result, the migration of Np in the postclosure chemical environment of the repository is a great concern to long-term repository performance. Because the temperature of the HLW repository could remain significantly higher than the ambient even thousands of years after the closure of the repository, predictions of the chemical behavior of Np in the repository can not be made without reliable thermodynamic data concerning the interactions of Np with the ligands that exist in the groundwater of the repository (e.g., OH–, F–, SO42– , PO43– and CO32) at elevated temperatures. Unfortunately, thermodynamic data on actinide complexation at elevated temperatures are scarce and highly scattered [2]. Lack of reliable geochemical thermodynamic data could lead to conservative decisions that have too big safety margins and raise the cost of the project. To help with the performance assessment of the HLW repository and fill the gap in thermodynamic data on actinide complexation at elevated temperatures, we have studied the complexation of actinides (Th, U, Np and Pu) with selected organic and inorganic ligands at elevated temperatures. This paper summarizes the results of the complexation of Np(V) with sulfate at 10–70°C.","","","Pacific Northwest National Lab.

This study consequently produced a database in which the DU aerosol source terms were specified both physically and chemically for a variety of penetrator-impact geometries and conditions. These source terms were used to calculate radiation doses and uranium concentrations for various scenarios as part of the Capstone DU Human Health Risk Assessment (HHRA). This paper describes the scenario-related biokinetics of uranium, and summarizes intakes, chemical concentrations to the organs, and E(50) and HT(50) for organs and tissues based on exposure scenarios for personnel in vehicles at the time of perforation as well as for first responders. For a given exposure scenario (duration time and breathing rates), the range of DU intakes among the target vehicles and shots was not large, about a factor of 10, with the lowest being from a ventilated operational Abrams tank and the highest being for an unventilated Abrams with DU penetrator perforating DU armor. The ranges of committed effective doses were more scenario-dependent than were intakes. For example, the largest range, a factor of 20, was shown for scenario A, a 1-min exposure, whereas, the range was only a factor of two for the first-responder scenario (E). In general, the committed effective doses were found to be in the tens of mSv. The risks ascribed to these doses are discussed separately.","","","Pacific Northwest National Lab.

The most frequently used guideline for uranium kidney burdens is the International Commission on Radiation Protection (ICRP) value of 3 µg U/g kidney, a value that is based largely upon chronic studies in animals. In the present effort, we have developed a risk model equation to assess potential outcomes of acute uranium exposure. Twenty-seven previously published case studies in which workers were acutely exposed to soluble compounds of uranium (as a result of workplace accidents) were analyzed. Kidney burdens of uranium for these individuals were determined based on uranium in the urine, and correlated with health effects observed over a period of up to 38 years. Based upon the severity of health effects, each individual was assigned a score (- to +++) and then placed into an Effect Group. A discriminant analysis was used to build a model equation to predict the Effect Group based on the amount of uranium in the kidneys. The model equation was able to predict the Effect Group with 85% accuracy. The risk model was used to predict the Effect Group for Soldiers exposed to DU as a result of friendly fire incidents during the 1991 Gulf War. This model equation can also be used to predict the Effect Group of new cases in which acute exposures to uranium have occurred.","","","Pacific Northwest National Lab.

Although the radiation exposure from DU is low, there is concern that DU deposited in the body may increase cancer rates. Radiation doses to various organs of the body resulting from the inhalation of DU aerosols measured in the Capstone studies were calculated using International Commission on Radiological Protection (ICRP) models. Organs and tissues with the highest calculated committed equivalent 50-yr doses were lung and extrathoracic tissues (nose and nasal passages, pharynx, larynx, mouth and thoracic lymph nodes). Doses to the bone surface and kidney were about 5 to 10% of the doses to the extrathoracic tissues. The methodologies of the ICRP International Steering Committee on Radiation Standards (ISCORS) were used for determining the whole body cancer risk. Organ-specific risks were estimated using ICRP and U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) methodologies. Risks for crewmembers and first responders were determined for selected scenarios based on the time interval of exposure and for vehicle and armor type. The lung was the organ with the highest cancer mortality risk, accounting for about 97% of the risks summed from all organs. The highest mean lifetime risk for lung cancer for the scenario with the longest exposure time interval (2 h) was 0.42%. This risk is low compared with the natural or background risk of 7.35%. These risks can be significantly reduced by using an existing ventilation system (if operable) and by reducing personnel time in the vehicle immediately after perforation.","","","Pacific Northwest National Lab.

The primary purpose of these impact limiters is to absorb energy to reduce loads on the cask structure during impacts associated with a severe accident. Impact limiters are also credited in many packages with protecting closure seals and maintaining lower peak temperatures during fire events. For this credit to be taken in safety analyses, the impact limiter attachment system must be shown to retain the impact limiter following Normal Conditions of Transport (NCT) and Hypothetical Accident Conditions (HAC) impacts. Large casks are often certified by analysis only because of the costs associated with testing. Therefore, some cask impact limiter attachment systems have not been tested in real impacts. A recent structural analysis of the T-3 Spent Fuel Containment Cask found problems with the design of the impact limiter attachment system. Assumptions in the original Safety Analysis for Packaging (SARP) concerning the loading in the attachment bolts were found to be inaccurate in certain drop orientations. This paper documents the lessons learned and their applicability to impact limiter attachment system designs.","","available","Savannah River Site (SRS), Aiken, SC (United States)","USDOE","","United States","2009-02-09T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: Journal of Packaging, Transport, Storage, and Security of Radioactive Material","","Medium: ED","","M-RPT-G-00001","DE-AC09-08SR22470","TRN: US0901467","","","2009-12-16T00:00:00Z","947623","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/947623","https://www.osti.gov/servlets/purl/947623","Journal of Packaging, Transport, Storage, and Security of Radioactive Material","",""

The LYNX design specifically targets applications that require radiation detection capabilities but possess little or no infrastructure. In these settings, users need the capability to deploy sensors for extended periods of time that analyze whatever signal-starved data can be captured, since little or no control may be exerted over measurement conditions. The fundamental sensing elements of the LYNX system are traditional NaI(Tl) and 3He detectors. The new developments reported here center on two themes: low-power electronics and computationally simple analysis algorithms capable of discriminating gamma-ray signatures indicative of special nuclear materials from those of naturally occurring radioactive material. Incorporating tripwire-detection algorithms based on gamma-ray spectral signatures into a low-power electronics package significantly improves performance in environments where sensors encounter nuisance sources.","","","Pacific Northwest National Lab.

The immobilization of high-level nuclear wastes has been an active area of research and development for over 50 years. Borosilicate glasses and complex ceramic composites have been developed to meet many technical challenges and current needs, although regulatory issues, which vary widely from country to country, have yet to be resolved. Cooperative international programs to develop advanced proliferation-resistant nuclear technologies to close the nuclear fuel cycle and increase the efficiency of nuclear energy production might create new separation waste streams that could demand new concepts and materials for nuclear waste immobilization. This article reviews the current state-of-the-art understanding regarding the materials science of glasses and ceramics for the immobilization of high-level nuclear waste and excess nuclear materials and discusses approaches to address new waste streams.","","","Pacific Northwest National Lab.

One result of this use is a groundwater plume containing elevated levels of U and Cu beneath the dry ponds and adjacent to the Columbia River. We have used synchrotron-based micro-X-ray fluorescence (μXRF) imaging, micro-X-ray absorption fine structure (μXANES) spectroscopy, and micro-X-ray diffraction (μXRD) techniques combined with bulk U LIII-edge X-ray absorption fine structure (XAFS) spectroscopy to determine the distribution and speciation of U and Cu through the vadose and groundwater zones beneath North Processing Pond #2 (NPP2). Sediment samples were collected from the vadose zone (8’ and 12’ depths), and a sample from the groundwater zone was collected just below the water table (12’-14’ depth). μXRF imaging revealed two major U occurrences within the vadose and groundwater zones: (1) low to moderate concentrations of U(VI) associated with mineral surfaces (particularly chlorite), and (2) high concentration U(VI)-containing micron-sized particles associated with surface coatings on grains of muscovite and chlorite. These U(VI) hot spots are frequently spatially correlated with Cu(II) hot spots. In the groundwater zone, these particles were identified as the copper-uranyl-silicate cuprosklodowskite and the cupper-uranyl-phosphate metatorbernite. In contrast, the U-Cu-containing particles are X-ray amorphous in the vadose zone. Fits of U LIII-edge XAFS spectra by linear-combination fitting indicate that U speciation consists of ~ 75% uranyl sorbed to clays and ~25% metatorbernite-like X-ray amorphous U-Cu-phosphates (8’ depth); nearly 100% sorbed uranyl (12’ depth); and ~70% sorbed uranyl and ~30% cuprosklodowskite/metatorbernite (ground water zone). These findings suggest that the dissolution of U(VI)-Cu(II)-bearing solids as well as the desorption of U(VI), mainly from phyllosilicates, are important sources of U(VI) in the Area 300 groundwater plume.","American Chemical Society (ACS)","","Pacific Northwest National Lab.

We have developed static microcosms that are similar to bioreduction process studies in situ under laminar flow conditions or in sediment pores. Uranium L{sub 3}-edge X-ray absorption near-edge spectroscopy analysis with depth in the microcosms indicated that transformation of U{sup VI} to U{sup IV} occurred by at least two distinct processes. Extended X-ray absorption fine structure (EXAFS) analysis indicated that initial U{sup VI} species associated with C- and P-containing ligands were transformed to U{sup IV} in the form of uraninite and U associated with Fe-bound ligands. Microbial community analysis identified putative Fe{sup III} and sulfate reducers at two different depths in the microcosms. The slow reduction of U{sup VI} to U{sup IV} may contribute the stability of U{sup IV} within microcosms at 11 months after a decrease in bioreducing conditions due to limited electron donors.","","","Oak Ridge National Lab.

Functional requirements of all fuel designs include 1) retention of fission products and fuel nuclides, 2) dimensional stability, and 3) maintaining a coolable geometry. In all cases, the anticipated fuel performance under normal or off-normal conditions is the limiting factor in reactor system design, and cumulative effects of increased exposure to higher burnup degrades fuel performance. In high-temperature (thermal) gas reactor systems, fuel particles of uranium dioxide or uranium oxycarbide particles are coated with layers of carbon and SiC (or ZrC). Such fuels have been used successfully to very high burnup (10-20% of heavy-metal atoms) and can withstand transient temperatures up to 1600°C. Oxide (pellet-type) and metal (pin-type) fuels clad in stainless steel tubes have been successfully used in liquid metal cooled fast reactors, attaining burnup of 20% or more of heavy-metal atoms. Those fuel designs are being adapted for actinide management missions, requiring greater contents of minor actinides (e.g. Am, Np, Cm). The current status of each fuel system is reviewed and technical challenges confronting the implementation of each fuel in the context of the entire advanced reactor fuel cycle (fabrication, reactor performance, recycle) are discussed.","","","Idaho National Lab.

Forty CRC state-points from five pressurized-water reactors were selected for the study and the type of CRC state-points that may be applicable for validation of burnup credit criticality safety calculations for spent fuel transport/storage/disposal systems are identified. The study employed cross-section sensitivity and uncertainty analysis methods developed at Oak Ridge National Laboratory and the TSUNAMI set of tools in the SCALE code system as a means to investigate system similarity on an integral and nuclide-reaction specific level. The results indicate that, except for the fresh fuel core configuration, all analyzed CRC state-points are either highly similar, similar, or marginally similar to a generic cask containing spent nuclear fuel assemblies with burnups ranging from 10 to 60 GWd/MTU. Based on the integral system parameter, C{sub k}, approximately 30 of the 40 CRC state-points are applicable to validation of burnup credit in the generic cask containing typical spent fuel assemblies with burnups ranging from 10 to 60 GWd/MTU. The state-points providing the highest similarity (C{sub k} &gt; 0.95) were attained at or near the end of a reactor cycle. The C{sub k} values are dominated by neutron reactions with major actinides and hydrogen, as the sensitivities of these reactions are much higher than those of the minor actinides and fission products. On a nuclide-reaction specific level, the CRC state-points provide significant similarity for most of the actinides and fission products relevant to burnup credit. A comparison of energy-dependent sensitivity profiles shows a slight shift of the CRC K{sub eff} sensitivity profiles toward higher energies in the thermal region as compared to the K{sub eff} sensitivity profile of the generic cask. Parameters representing coverage of the application by the CRCs on an energy-dependent, nuclide-reaction specific level (i.e., effectiveness of the CRCs for validating the cross sections as used in the application) were also examined. Based on the CRCs with C{sub k} &gt; 0.8 and an assumed relative standard deviation for uncovered covariance data of 25%, the relative standard deviation of K{sub eff} due to uncovered sensitivity data varies from 0.79% to 0.95% for cask burnups ranging from 10 to 60 GWd/MTU. As expected, this uncertainty in K{sub eff} is largely dominated by noncoverage of sensitivities from major actinides and hydrogen. The contributions from fission products and minor actinides are very small and comparable to statistical uncertainties in K{sub eff} results. These results (again, assuming a 25% uncertainty for uncovered covariance data) indicate that there could be approximately 1% uncertainty in the calculated application K{sub eff} due to incomplete neutronic testing (validation) of the software by the CRCs. However, this conclusion also assumes all other uncertainties in the complex CRC configurations (e.g., isotopic compositions of burned fuel, operation history, data) are well known. Thus, an evaluation of the uncertainties in the CRC configurations is needed prior to the use of CRCs for code validation (i.e., quantifying code bias and bias uncertainty).","","","Oak Ridge National Lab.

To facilitate the structural characterization of the precipitated solids derived from the neutralized raffinate, a set of reference compounds were synthesized and analyzed. The reference compounds include crystalline scorodite, poorly-crystalline scorodite, iron(III)-arsenate co-precipitates obtained under different pH conditions, and arsenate-adsorbed on goethite. The poorly-crystalline scorodite (prepared at pH 4 with Fe/As = 1) has similar As local structure as that of crystalline scorodite. Both As and Fe K-edge XAFS of poorly-crystalline scorodite yield consistent results on As-Fe (or Fe-As) shell. From As K-edge analysis the As-Fe shell has an inter-atomic distance of 3.33 {+-} 0.02 A and coordination number of 3.2; while from Fe K-edge analysis the Fe-As distance and coordination number are 3.31 {+-} 0.02 A and 3.8, respectively. These are in contrast with the typical arsenate adsorption on bidentate binuclear sites on goethite surfaces, where the As-Fe distance is 3.26 {+-} 0.03 A and coordination number is close to 2. A similar local structure identified in the poorly-crystalline scorodite is also found in co-precipitation solids (Fe(III)/As(V) = 3) when precipitated at the same pH (pH = 4): As-Fe distance 3.30 {+-} 0.03 A and coordination number 3.9; while at pH = 8 the co-precipitate has As-Fe distance of 3.27 {+-} 0.03 A and coordination number about 2, resembling more closely the adsorption case. The As local structure in the two neutralized raffinate solid series (precipitated at pH values up to 7) closely resembles that in the poorly-crystalline scorodite. All of the raffinate solids have the same As-Fe inter-atomic distance as that in the poorly-crystalline scorodite, and a systematic decrease in the As-Fe coordination is observed when pH is progressively increased; the basic poorly-crystalline scorodite structural feature remains in the raffinate solid up to pH 7.","","","Brookhaven National Lab.

Advanced materials can enable improved reactor performance via increased safety margins and design flexibility, in particular by providing increased strength, thermal creep resistance and superior corrosion and neutron radiation damage resistance.

"Embrittlernent of irradiated F82H in the absence of irradiation hardening","Klueh, Ronald L.; Shiba, Kiyoyuki; Sokolov, Mikhail A.","11 NUCLEAR FUEL CYCLE AND FUEL MATERIALS","Neutron irradiation of 7-12% Cr ferritic/martensitic steels below 425-450 °C produces microstructural defects and precipitation that cause an increase in yield stress. This irradiation hardening causes embrittlement, which is observed in a Charpy impact or fracture toughness test as an increase in the ductile-brittle transition temperature. Based on observations that show little change in strength in steels irradiated above 425-450 °C, the general conclusion has been that no embrittlement occurs above these temperatures. In a recent study of F82H steel, significant embrittlement was observed after irradiation at 500 °C. This embrittlement is apparently due to irradiation-accelerated Laves-phase precipitation. Furthermore, observations of the embrittlement in the absence of hardening has been examined and analyzed with thermal-aging studies and computational thermodynamics calculations to illuminate and understand the effect.","Elsevier","","Oak Ridge National Lab.

The onset of anaerobic conditions resulted in the rapid release of U and phosphate to solution followed by the reprecipitation of meta-autinite. Spectroscopy measurements (XANES) indicated that the U was not released via reduction during the bacterial incubations, but instead dissolution was promoted by uptake and immobilization of P by the bacterial cells. Our results suggest that U(VI) in 'refractory' P mineral phases may be mobilized from U mill tailings and/or U disposal sites and that the nutrient status (P) of the geologic setting may be a predictor for the lability of U in these environments.","","","Argonne National Lab.

This article discusses the effects of applied load (the most important process parameter for fabrication of these fuels) on temperature distribution, microstructure, and mechanical properties. Friction bonding experiments showed that tool geometry caused temperature gradients across the tool surface. Temperatures at the joint interface suggested the advancing side of the tool produced a majority of the frictional heat, while the retreating side of the tool mainly forged the plasticized material while bonding increased with applied load. The microstructure across the tool surface was also altered and, as a function of applied load, affected the mechanical properties. The 6061 aluminum alloy had mechanical properties close to a T4 temper after processing. Results documented in this article will aid in continual enhancement of friction bonding for nuclear fuel plate fabrication, and will hopefully contribute to continued advancement of friction stir welding (FSW) state of the art.","","","Idaho National Lab.

As part of its post-service examination, four duplex tube sections were removed and Charpy impact testing was performed to characterize the crack arresting ability of nickel-bonded tube interfaces. Scanning electron microscopy (SEM) examination was also performed to characterize and identify changes in bond material microstructure. From room temperature to 400 degrees C, all samples demonstrated ductility and crack-stopping ability similar to that exhibited by beginning-of-life samples. However, at low temperature (-5 degrees C), samples removed from the lower region of the superheater (near the sodium inlet) failed while those from the upper region (near the sodium outlet) did not. SEM analysis revealed that all the tube-tube interfaces showed evidence of iron diffusion into the nickel braze, which resulted in the formation of a multiphase diffusion structure. Yet, significant void formation was only observed in the bond layer of the tubes removed from the lower region. This may be due to a change in the crystal microstructure of one of the phases within the bond layer that occurs in the 350 to 450 degrees C temperature range, which results in a lower density and the formation of porosity. Apparently, only the samples from the higher temperature region were exposed to this transition temperature, and the resulting large voids that developed acted as stress concentrators that led to low-temperature embrittlement and failure of the Charpy impact specimens.","","","Idaho National Lab.

Pu recycling as fuel, and transmutation of Minor Actinides (MA: Np, Am, and in some concepts also Cm) in reactors and/or MA burners are the steps considered to achieve this goal. U-free compounds are considered as matrices for Pu, MA burning. In some cases, these matrices are envisaged also for the conditioning and immobilization of radionuclides in final disposal concepts. The list of properties of a good inert matrix includes good chemical compatibility with the actinides, easy and economical processes of fabrication and, if required, reprocessing, and good thermo-mechanical performance in-pile, in terms of thermal transport, swelling and high temperature stability. In addition, the material must retain the good properties under the cumulative effect of radiation damage, and fission product accumulation. Since good radiation resistance materials usually exhibit poor thermal transport, in some concepts the actinides are stabilized in a host phase (e.g. zirconia) dispersed in a high thermal conductivity matrix (either ceramic or metallic).","","","Pacific Northwest National Lab.

For the carbonate minerals, the fluorescence spectra depend on the stoichiometry of the mineral. For the phosphate minerals the fluorescence spectra closely resemble each other despite the differences in their composition and structure. For all uranium oxyhydroxides, the fluorescence spectra are largely red-shifted as compared with those of the uranium carbonates and phosphates and their vibronic bands are broadened and less resolved. The much enhanced spectra resolution at LHeT allows more accurate calculation of the O=U=O symmetrical stretch frequency, ν1, corresponding to the average spacing of the vibronic peaks of the fluorescence spectra and the spectral origin as reflected by the position of the first vibronic band. It was found that both the average ν1 and λ1 values correlate well with the average basicity of the inorganic anion.","","","Pacific Northwest National Lab. (PNNL), Richland, WA (United States).

A series of hydraulically-saturated and -unsaturated column experiments were performed to i.) assess the effect of water content on the advective desorption and migration of uranium from contaminated sediments, and ii.) evaluate the uranium concentration that can develop in porewater and/or groundwater as a result of desorption/dissolution reactions. Flow rate and moisture content were varied to evaluate the influence of contact time, pore water velocity, and macropore desaturation on aqueous uranium concentrations. Sediments were collected from the T-TX-TY tank farm complex and the 300 Area Process Ponds located on the Hanford Site, southeastern Washington State. The sediments vary in depth, mineralogy, and in contamination events. Experiments were conducted under mildly alkaline/calcareous conditions representative of conditions commonly encountered at repository sites across the arid western United States and, in particular, the Hanford site. Results illustrate the release of uranium from these sediments is kinetically controlled and low water contents encountered within the Hanford vadose zone result in the formation of mobile-immobile water regimes, which isolate a fraction of the reactive sites within the sediments, effectively reducing the concentration of uranium released into migrating porewaters.","","","Pacific Northwest National Lab.

Nuclear fuels and structure materials are subject to a severe radiation environment and their properties, including thermal conductivity change significantly with time and irradiation level. In particular, the accumulation of fission products and the formation of He bubbles can decrease the heat transfer, leading to overheating of the fuel element. In this work, we use the phase-field method to study the effect of microstructural changes on thermal conductivity. We developed a phase-field model to simulate the He bubble formation and growth in a single/polycrystalline material with defects. The model takes into account the generation of gas atoms and defects, gas atom diffusivity inhomogeneity, gas atom segregation, and gas bubble nucleation. With the model, we simulated the gas bubble and temperature evolution, and calculated the effect of gas bubble volume fraction on effective thermal conductivity.","","","Pacific Northwest National Lab.

The properties and hence stability of uraninite are dependent on its size, structure and composition. In this study, the local-, intermediate-, and long-range molecular-scale structure of nanoscale uraninite produced by Shewanella oneidensis strain MR-1 was investigated using EXAFS, SR-based powder diffraction and TEM. The uraninite products were found to be structurally homologous with stoichiometric UO2 under all conditions considered. Significantly, there was no evidence for lattice strain of the biogenic uraninite nanoparticles. The fresh nanoparticles were found to exhibit a well-ordered interior core of diameter ca 1 nm and an outer region of thickness ca ~ 1 nm in which the structure is locally distorted. The lack of nanoparticle strain and structural homology with stoichiometric UO2 suggests that established thermodynamic parameters for the latter material are an appropriate starting point to model the behavior of nano-biogenic uraninite. The detailed structural analysis in this study provides an essential foundation for subsequent investigations of more environmentally relevant samples.","","","Pacific Northwest National Lab.

Bioreduction experiments were conducted with uranyl acetate as the electron acceptor and sodium lactate as the electron donor under resting cell conditions in a 30 mM NaHCO3 buffer, and in a PIPES-buffered artificial groundwater (PBAGW). MR-1 was cultured in batch mode in a defined minimal medium with a specified air-to-medium volume ratio such that electron acceptor (O2) limiting conditions were reached just when cells were harvested for subsequent experiments. The rate of U(VI) bioreduction was manipulated by varying the cell density and the incubation temperature (1.0 _ 108 cell ml_1 at 20 _C or 2.0 _ 108 cell ml_1 at 37 _C) to generate U(IV) solids at ‘‘fast” and ‘‘slow” rates in the two different buffers. The presence of Ca in PBAGW buffer altered U(VI) speciation and solubility, and significantly decreased U(VI) bioreduction kinetics. High resolution transmission electron microscopy was used to measure uraninite particle size distributions produced under the four different conditions. The most common primary particle size was 2.9–3.0 nm regardless of U(VI) bioreduction rate or background electrolyte. Extended X-ray absorption fine-structure spectroscopy was also used to estimate uraninite particle size and was consistent with TEM results. The reactivity of the biogenic uraninite products with dissolved oxygen was tested, and neither U(VI) bioreduction rate nor background electrolyte had any statistical effect on oxidation rates. With MR-1, uraninite particle size was not controlled by the bioreduction rate of U(VI) or the background electrolyte. These results for MR-1, where U(VI) bioreduction rate had no discernible effect on uraninite particle size or oxidation rate, contrast with our recent research with Shewanella putrefaciens CN32, where U(VI) bioreduction rate strongly influenced both uraninite particle size and oxidation rate. These two studies with Shewanella species can be viewed as consistent if one assumes that particle size controls oxidation rates, so the similar uraninite particle sizes produced by MR-1 regardless of U(VI) bioreduction rate would result in similar oxidation rates. Factors that might explain why U(VI) bioreduction rate was an important control on uraninite particle size for CN32 but not for MR-1 are discussed.","","","Pacific Northwest National Lab.

Solvation was included in the calculations using the CPCM continuum solvation method. Using the data from vibrational frequency calculations, the pKa was calculated for the acids, and compared to Cyanex-301. The unexpectedly high pKa for bis(o-trifluoromethylphenyl)dithiophosphinic acid, when compared to the ortho-meta, meta-meta, and para-para isomers, is rationalized by e- repulsion between nearby fluorines and the sulfurs in the anion. This repulsion destabilizes the anion, versus the other isomers, thus raising the pKa.","","","Idaho National Lab.

An important prerequisite to successful illicit trafficking activities is access to a suitable logistical infrastructure enabling an undercover shipment of radioactive materials and, in case of trafficking natural uranium or thorium ore, capable of transporting large volumes of material. Covert en route diversion of an authorised uranium transport, together with covert diversion of uranium concentrate from an operating or closed uranium mines or mills, are subject of case studies. Such cases, involving Israel, Iran, Pakistan and Libya, have been analyzed in terms of international actors involved and methods deployed. Using international incident data contained in the Database on Nuclear Smuggling, Theft and Orphan Radiation Sources (DSTO) and international experience gained from the fight against drug trafficking, a generic Trafficking Pathway Model (TPM) is developed for trafficking of natural radionuclides. The TPM covers the complete trafficking cycle, ranging from material diversion, covert material transport, material concealment, and all associated operational procedures. The model subdivides the trafficking cycle into five phases: (1) Material diversion by insider(s) or initiation by outsider(s); (2) Covert transport; (3) Material brokerage; (4) Material sale; (5) Material delivery. An Action Plan is recommended, addressing the strengthening of the national infrastructure for material protection and accounting, development of higher standards of good governance, and needs for improving the control system deployed by customs, border guards and security forces.","","","","","","United States","2008-08-07T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: AIP Conference Proceedings; Journal Volume: 1034; Journal Issue: 1; Conference: NRE-VIII: 8.

Its primary mission was to produce plutonium metal, fabricate weapons parts, and stabilize reactive materials. These operations, and subsequent activities, were performed in production lines, consisting primarily of hundreds of gloveboxes. Over the years, these gloveboxes and attendant processes have been continuously modified. The plant is currently inactive and Fluor Hanford has been tasked with cleaning out contaminated equipment and gloveboxes from the facility so it can be demolished in the near future. Approximately 100 gloveboxes at PFP have been cleaned out in the past four years and about 90 gloveboxes remain to be cleaned out. Because specific commitment dates for this work have been established with the State of Washington and other entities, it is important to adopt work practices that increase the safety and speed of this effort. The most recent work practice to be adopted by Fluor Hanford D and D workers is the use of 3-D models to make the process of cleaning out the radioactive gloveboxes more efficient. The use of 3-D models has significantly improved the work-planning process by giving workers a clear image of glovebox construction and composition, which in turn is used to determine cleanout methods and work sequences. The 3-D visual products also enhance safety by enabling workers to more easily identify hazards and implement controls. Further, the ability to identify and target the removal of radiological material early in the D and D process provides substantial dose reduction for the workers.","","","Hanford Site (HNF), Richland, WA (United States)","USDOE - Office of Environmental Management (EM)","","United States","2008-07-15T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: RADWASTE SOLUTIONS; Journal Issue: SEP/OCT 2008","","Medium: ED","","HNF-38284 Rev 0","DE-AC06-96RL13200","TRN: US0803950","","","2009-12-16T00:00:00Z","934869","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/934869","https://www.osti.gov/servlets/purl/934869","RADWASTE SOLUTIONS","SEP/OCT 2008",""

Surface complexation model (SCM) calculations for U(VI) sorption, using only U(VI) surface-reaction constants obtained from U(VI) sorption data on freshly synthesized ferrihydrite at different pHs, were similar to the measured U(VI) sorption results on pure synthetic ferrihydrite and on HFS with high contents of ferrihydrite (5 wt%) added. However, the SCM prediction using only U(VI) sorption reactions and constants for synthetic ferrihydrite overestimated U(VI) sorption on the natural HFS or HFS with addition of low amounts of added ferrihydrite (1 wt% added). Over-predicted U(VI) sorption was attributed to reduced reactivity of natural ferrihydrite present in Hanford Site sediments, compared to freshly prepared synthetic ferrihydrite. Even though the SCM general composite (GC) approach is considered to be a semi-quantitative estimation technique for contaminant sorption, which requires systematic experimental data on the sorbent-sorbate system being studied to obtain credible SCM parameters, we have found the general composite SCM model is still a useful technique for describing U(VI) sorption on natural sediments. Based on U(VI) batch sorption results, two simple U(VI) monodentate surface species, SO_UO2HCO3 and SO_UO2OH on ferrihydrite and phyllosillicate in HFS, respectively, can be successfully used to describe U(VI) sorption onto Hanford Site sediment contacting varying geochemical solutions.","","","Pacific Northwest National Lab.

Both solid state and molten LiCl-zeolite-A ion exchange tests were conducted for selectively removing Cs and Sr from LiCl-based salt. The solid-state tests produced in excess of 99% removal of Cs and Sr. The molten state tests failed due to phase transformation of the zeolite structure when in contact with the molten LiCl salt.","","","Idaho National Lab.

Additionally, the leaching behavior of {sup 233}U(VI) from boehmite was examined as a function of pH and HEDPA concentration. The results are discussed in terms of sludge washing procedures that may be utilized during underground tank waste remediation. In the pH range 4 to 10, complexation of Al(III) by HEDPA significantly enhanced dissolution of boehmite. This phenomenon was especially pronounced in the neutral pH region where the solubility of aluminum, in the absence of complexants, is limited by the formation of sparsely soluble aluminum hydroxides. At pH higher than 10, dissolution of synthetic boehmite was inhibited by HEDPA, likely due to sorption of Al(III):HEDPA complexes. Addition of HEDPA to equilibrated U(VI)-synthetic boehmite suspensions yielded an increase in the aqueous phase uranium concentration. Partitioning of uranium between the solid and aqueous phase is described in terms of U(VI):HEDPA speciation and dissolution of the boehmite solid phase.","","","Lawrence Berkeley National Lab.

For facility monitoring air samples can be collected from within a facility and analyzed for short lived radioxenons to estimate inventories of residual plutonium holdup within the facility. For landfill cleanup activities soil gas sampling for xenon isotopes can be used to define the locations of spent fuel and transuranic wastes. Short-lived radioxenon isotopes are continuously produced by spontaneous fission of plutonium-240 in transuranic wastes. Large volume soil-gas samples provide extremely sensitive measurement of radioxenon in the subsurface; a characteristic of transuranic waste. The analysis employs a modified Automated Radioxenon Sampling and Analysis (ARSA) system. Proof of principle measurements at a Hanford Site liquid waste disposal site showed xenon-133 at levels in soil gas are approximately 16,000 times the detection limit and lower levels of xenon-135 from the spontaneous fission of plutonium-240 were also measured. Stable xenon isotopes are also produced by spontaneous fission but are subject to background concentrations in ambient air samples (facilities) but less so in soil gas where free exchange with ambient air is restricted. Rare gas mass spectrometry is used for highly precise stable xenon isotopic measurements. Stable xenon isotopic ratios from fission are distinct from natural xenon background ratios. Neutron capture on xenon-135 produces an excess of xenon-136 above fission ratios and thus provides a means of distinguishing reactor sources (e.g. spent fuel) from separated transuranic materials (plutonium).","","","Pacific Northwest National Lab.

While it is generally understood that a method for direct monitoring of process on-line and in near-real time (NRT) would be the best defense against protracted diversion scenarios, an effective method with these qualities has yet to be developed. Here, we attempt to bridge this gap by proposing an on-line NRT process monitoring method that should be sensitive to minor alterations in process conditions and compatible with small, easily deployable, detection systems. This Approach is known as the Multi-Isotope Process (MIP) Monitor and involves the determination and recognition of the contaminant pattern within a process stream for a suite of indicator (radioactive) elements present in the spent fuel as a function of process variables. Utilization of a suite of radio-elements, including ones with multiple oxidation states, decreases the likelihood that attempts to divert Pu by altering the ReDox environment within the process would go undetected. In addition, by identifying gamma-emitting indicator isotopes, this Approach might eliminate the need for bulky neutron detection systems, relying instead on small, portable, high-resolution gamma detectors easily deployable throughout the facility.","","","Pacific Northwest National Lab.

X-ray absorption near edge structure spectroscopy (XANES) indicate that the U is hexavalent and extended X-ray absorption fine structure spectroscopy (EXAFS) shows that the uranyl is coordinated by carbonate.

Thus, the potential may exists for the accumulation of fissile materials in such nuclear waste storage tanks during lengthy nuclear waste storage and processing. To evaluate the nuclear criticality safety in a typical nuclear waste storage tank, a study was initiated to measure the affinity of granular activated carbon, hematite and anhydrous sodium phosphate to sorb plutonium, neptunium and uranium from alkaline salt solutions. Tests with simulated and actual nuclear waste solutions established the affinity of the solids for plutonium, neptunium and uranium upon contact of the solutions with each of the solids. The removal of plutonium and neptunium from the synthetic salt solution by nuclear waste storage tank solids may be due largely to the presence of the granular activated carbon and transition metal oxides in these storage tank solids or sludge. Granular activated carbon and hematite also showed measurable affinity for both plutonium and neptunium. Sodium phosphate, used here as a reference sorbent for uranium, as expected, exhibited high affinity for uranium and neptunium, but did not show any measurable affinity for plutonium.","","available","Savannah River Site (SRS), Aiken, SC (United States)","USDOE","","United States","2008-05-30T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: Journal of Environmental Radioactivity","","Medium: ED","","WSRC-STI-2008-00272","DE-AC09-96SR18500","Journal ID: ISSN 0265-931X; JERAEE; TRN: US0803753","","","2009-12-16T00:00:00Z","933162","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/933162","https://www.osti.gov/servlets/purl/933162","Journal of Environmental Radioactivity","",""

Here, we explored the use of geophysical approaches for monitoring the spatiotemporal distribution of hydrological and biogeochemical transformations associated with a Cr(VI)bioremediation experiment performed at Hanford, WA. We first integrated hydrological wellbore and geophysical tomographic datasets to estimate hydrological zonation at the study site. Using results from laboratory biogeophysical experiments and constraints provided by field geochemical datasets, we then interpreted time-lapse seismic and radar tomographic datasets, collected during thirteen acquisition campaigns over a three year experimental period, in terms of hydrological and biogeochemical transformations. The geophysical monitoring datasets were used to infer: the spatial distribution of injected electron donor; the evolution of gas bubbles; variations in total dissolved solids (nitrate and sulfate) as a function of pumping activity; the formation of precipitates and dissolution of calcites; and concomitant changes in porosity. Although qualitative in nature, the integrated interpretation illustrates how geophysical techniques have the potential to provide a wealth of information about coupled hydrobiogeochemical responses to remedial treatments in high spatial resolution and in a minimally invasive manner. Particularly novel aspects of our study include the use of multiple lines of evidence to constrain the interpretation of a long-term, field-scale geophysical monitoring dataset and the interpretation of the transformations as a function of hydrological heterogeneity and pumping activity.","","","Pacific Northwest National Lab.

Experiments were performed in a shielded hot cell at the Materials and Fuels Complex at Idaho National Laboratory. The goal of these experiments was to collect, by an electrochemical process, kilogram quantities of uranium and plutonium into what is called a liquid cadmium cathode (LCC). For each experiment, a steel basket loaded with chopped spent nuclear fuel from the Experimental Breeder Reactor II acted as the anode in the electrorefiner. The cathode was a beryllium oxide crucible containing ~26 kg of cadmium metal (the LCC). In the three experiments performed to date, between 1 and 2 kg of heavy metal was collected in the LCC after passing an integrated current between 1.80 and 2.16 MC (500 and 600 A h) from the anode to the cathode.

One of the key steps in the pyroprocessing was electrorefining the spent fuel in a metal form in a molten LiCl-KCl-UCl3/liquid cadmium system using an engineering scale electrorefiner (Mark-IV ER). This article summarizes experimental observations and engineering aspects for the roles of the liquid cadmium for electrorefining of the spent fuel in the Mark-IV ER. It was found that the liquid cadmium pool acted as an intermediate electrode during the electrorefining process. The cadmium level gradually decreased due to its high vapor pressure at the ER operating temperature. The low cadmium level caused the anode assembly to electrically short with the ER vessel hardware, which resulted in difficulty determining the endpoint of uranium dissolution from the anode baskets and reducing the current efficiency. A reflux cadmium vapor trap has successfully prevented the cadmium level from decreasing and mitigated cadmium vapor deposition on cold metal surface inside the ER.","","","Idaho National Lab.

Located about 400 yards from the Columbia River, the K East Basin is one of two indoor pools that formerly contained irradiated nuclear fuel, radioactive sludge and tons of contaminated debris. In unique and path-breaking work, workers finished removing the spent fuel from the K Basins in 2004. In May 2007, workers completed vacuuming the sludge into containers in the K East Basin, and transferring it into containers in the K West Basin. In December, they finished vacuuming the remainder of K West Basin sludge into these containers. The K East Basin was emptied of its radioactive inventory first because it was more contaminated than the K West Basin, and had leaked in the past. In October 2007, Fluor Hanford began physical D&amp;D of the 8,400-square foot K East Basin by pouring approximately 14-inches of grout into the bottom of it. Grout is a type of special cement used for encasing waste. Two months later, Fluor Hanford workers completed sluicing contaminated sand from the large filter that had sieved contaminants from the basin water for more than 50 years. Next, they poured grout into the filter housing and the vault that surrounds the filter, as well as into ion exchange columns that also helped filter basin water. For a six-week period in February and March, personnel drained the approximately one million gallons of contaminated water from the K East Basin. The effort required more than 200 tanker truck loads that transported the water to an effluent treatment facility for treatment and then release. A thin fixative was also applied to the basin walls as the water was removed to hold residual contamination in place. As soon as the water was out of the basin, Fluor pumped in approximately 18 feet of 'controlled density fill' material (somewhat similar to sand) to shield workers to a safe level from the residual radioactivity. Workers then continued preparations for demolishing the structure. Currently, they are isolating utilities, removing asbestos, draining oils, and removing other items not allowed to be disposed in Hanford's Environmental Restoration Disposal Facility (ERDF). The basin's superstructure will be demolished using a heavy industrial excavator equipped with a shear. This portion of the work is expected to be completed in September, with removal of the basin substructure to follow in 2009. D&amp;D of the K East Basin eliminated the final major radioactive sources there, and made the Columbia River and the adjacent environment safer for everyone who lives downstream.","","","Hanford Site (HNF), Richland, WA (United States)","USDOE - Office of Environmental Management (EM)","","United States","2008-04-21T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: DECONTAMINATION DECOMMISSIONING & REUTILIZATION NEWSLETTER AMERICAN NUCLEAR SOCIETY SPRING 2008 (PRE-PUBLICATION); Journal Issue: SPRING 2008","","Medium: ED","","HNF-37499 Rev 0","DE-AC06-96RL13200","TRN: US0803221","","","2009-12-16T00:00:00Z","927479","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/927479","https://www.osti.gov/servlets/purl/927479","DECONTAMINATION DECOMMISSIONING & REUTILIZATION NEWSLETTER AMERICAN NUCLEAR SOCIETY SPRING 2008 (PRE-PUBLICATION)","SPRING 2008",""

A labscale system was used with non-radioactive surrogate salts to determine optimal particle size distributions and time at temperature. An engineering-scale system was then installed in the Hot Fuel Examination Facility hot cell and used to demonstrate blending of actual electrorefiner salt with zeolite. In those tests, it was shown that the results are still favorable with actinide-loaded salt and that batch size of this v-blender could be increased to a level consistent with efficient production operations for EBR-II spent fuel treatment. One technical challenge that remains for this technology is to mitigate the problem of material retention in the v-blender due to formation of caked patches of salt/zeolite on the inner v-blender walls.","","","Idaho National Lab.

At the B3LYP/6-31G(d,p)/SDD level, an asymmetric transition state leading to the formation of a uranium hydroxyl fluoride, U(OH)F{sub 5}, and hydrogen fluoride was found with an energy barrier of +77.3 kJ/mol and an enthalpy of reaction of +63.0 kJ/mol (both including zero-point energy corrections). Addition of diffuse functions to all atoms except uranium led to only minor changes in the structure and relative energies of the reacting complex and transition state. However, a significant change in the product complex structure was found, significantly reducing the enthalpy of reaction to +31.9 kJ/mol. Similar structures and values were found for PBE0 and MP2 calculations with this larger basis set, supporting the B3LYP results. No symmetric transition state leading to the direct formation of uranium oxide tetrafluoride, UOF{sub 4}, was found, indicating that the reaction under ambient conditions likely includes several more steps than the mechanisms commonly mentioned.

We found that, as the 15 plume propagating through sediments, dramatic pH reduction (up to 4 units) occurred at moving 16 plume fronts. Massive amounts of colloids, including U-colloids, formed at plume fronts. The 17 infiltration flow rates strongly affect U fate and transport.

We developed a radiative transfer model to determine feasibility and system requirements for passive millimeter-wave spectral detection of terrestrial gases. We designed and built a Dicke-switched multispectral radiometer in the 146-154-GHz band to detect nitric oxide (NO), a prototypical gas of nuclear fuel processing operations. We first tested the spectral detection capability of the radiometer in the laboratory using a gas cell and then field tested it at the Nevada test site at a distance of 600 m from a stack that released hot plumes of NO and air. With features such as Dicke-switched integration, frequent online calibration, and spectral baseline subtraction, we demonstrated the feasibility of remote detection of terrestrial gases by a ground-based radiometer.","","","Argonne National Lab.

This paper examines the behavior of one of the NRC certified transportation casks, the TN-68 [3], for drop-impact events. The specific area examined is the behavior of the bolted connections in the cask body and the closure lid, which are significantly loaded during the hypothetical drop-impact event. Analytical work to evaluate the NRC-certified TN-68 spent fuel transport cask [3] for a 9-m (30-ft) drop-impact event on a flat, unyielding, horizontal surface, was performed using the ANSYS® [4] and LS DYNA™ [5] finite-element analysis codes.

The modified solution is applied incrementally through irradiation, which allows the material properties and irradiation temperature to change with time. It also removes the restriction in the original solution that Poisson’s ratio in creep for the pyrocarbon layers be set to 0.5. It is presented in a manner that would enable its application to a system of any number of coating layers, not just the three layers of a TRISO-coated particle.

Using a high resolution modification to the 2-MGEM, it is possible to obtain generalized ellipsometry images of coating layer cross-sections with a pixel size of 2.5 m and an optical resolution of ~ 4 m. The most important parameter that can be extracted from these ellipsometry images is the diattenuation, which can be directly related to the optical anisotropy factor (OAF or OPTAF) used in previous characterization studies of tristructural isotropic (TRISO) coated particles. Because high resolution images can be obtained, the data for each coating layer contains >6,000 points, allowing considerable statistical analysis. This analysis has revealed that the diattenuation of the inner pyrocarbon (IPyC) and outer pyrocarbon (OPyC) coatings varies significantly throughout the layer. The 2-MGEM data can also be used to determine the principal axis angle of the pyrocarbon layers, which is nearly perpendicular to the TRISO radius (i.e., growth direction) and corresponds to the average orientation of the graphine planes.","","","Oak Ridge National Lab.

We used X-ray absorption spectroscopy to determine the valence state and chemical speciation of U in sediment samples collected at a variety of depths through the contaminant plume at the Field Research Center at Oak Ridge, TN, before and after approximately 400 days of in situ biostimulation, as well as in duplicate bioreduced sediments after 363 days of resting conditions. The results indicate that U(VI) in subsurface sediments was partially reduced to 10-40% U(IV) during biostimulation. After biostimulation, U was no longer bound to carbon ligands and was adsorbed to Fe/Mn minerals. Reduction of U(VI) to U(IV) continued in sediment samples stored under anaerobic condition at &lt;4 C for 12 months, with the fraction of U(IV) in sediments more than doubling and U concentrations in the aqueous phase decreasing from 0.5-0.74 to &lt;0.1 {micro}M.

A 9Cr-ODS alloy was irradiated with 5 MeV Ni ions at temperatures of 500, 600 and 700ºC to doses up to 150 dpa. There was no significant change in the dislocation arrangement. For oxide particles, there is a small shrinkage in size and increase in density with increasing irradiation dose. The atom probe analysis on the unirradiated and the Ni ion irradiated 9Cr-ODS at 700ºC to 150 dpa shows similar spatial configuration of oxide particles. Radiation-induced void swelling was not identified following Ni ion irradiation. Irradiation with 1.0 MeV Kr ions at temperatures of 500, 600, 700 and 800ºC to doses of 30-50 dpa reveals the presence of voids in all the irradiation conditions and it is believed to be due to Kr ions trapped in the materials.

The U containing precipitates fluoresce a bright green under ultraviolet (UV) short-wave light which identify U-rich coatings on the gravel. Scanning electron microscopy (SEM) microprobe analysis show U concentration ranges from 1.6?19.8% (average of 7%) within the coatings with higher concentrations at the interface of the dolomite fragments. X-ray absorption near edge structure spectroscopy (XANES) indicate that the U is hexavalent and extended X-ray absorption fine structure spectroscopy (EXAFS) shows that the uranyl is coordinated by carbonate. The exact nature of the uranyl carbonates are difficult to determine, but some are best described by a split K{sup +}-like shell similar to grimselite [K{sub 4}Na(UO{sub 2})(CO{sub 3}){sub 3} {center_dot} H{sub 2}O] and other regions are better described by a single Ca{sup 2+}-like shell similar to liebigite [Ca{sub 2}(UO{sub 2})(CO{sub 3}){sub 3} {center_dot} 11(H{sub 2}O)] or andersonite [Na{sub 2}CaUO{sub 2}(CO{sub 3}){sub 3} {center_dot} 6H{sub 2}O].

The use of PCA allows the reduction of the 9-dimensional data (isotopic concentrations) into a 3-dimensional approximation, giving a visual representation of the changes in nuclear fuel composition with burnup. Real-world variation in the concentrations of {sup 234}U and {sup 236}U in the fresh (unirradiated) fuel was accounted for. The effects of reprocessing were also simulated. The results suggest that, 15 even after reprocessing, Pu isotopes can be used to determine both the type of reactor and the initial fuel composition with good discrimination.

Because of their cross-cutting relationship with the surrounding matrix, they have been proposed as potential fast paths from former contaminant discharge sites at the surface to the water table. However, little was known of the detailed hydrogeologic properties of the dikes and detailed modeling of flow and transport through the dikes had not been performed. We excavated a 2 m wide clastic dike at the Hanford Site and characterized it using an air minipermeameter, infrared imagery, and grain size analyses. Field injection experiments were also used to characterize the system. The resulting data were used to prepare a detailed numerical model of the clastic dike and surrounding matrix for a portion of the excavation. Unsaturated flow and transport through the system were modeled for several recharge rates. The highly heterogeneous nature of the system led to complex behavior, with the relative flux rates in the matrix and clastic dike being highly dependent on the recharge rates that were imposed on the system. The study suggests that the potential role of clastic dikes in vertical transport at the Hanford Site would depend on the leakage rate, and that areas of contaminant deposition formed at high flow rates might become isolated at low flow rates, and vice-versa. The results may also help explain the occurrence of complex breakthrough patterns of contaminants at the water table.","","","Pacific Northwest National Lab.

Two methods for extracting heated ash ions from a cold plasma flow are considered, specifically, that by increasing the ion gyroradius and that due to ion drift in a curved magnetic field.

The wastes were initially hot because of radioactive decay, and many exhibited extreme chemical character in terms of pH, salinity, and radionuclide concentration. At present, 67 of the 149 single shell tanks are suspected to have released over 1.9 million L of tank waste to the vadose zone, with most leak events occurring between 1950 and 1975. Boreholes have been placed through the largest vadose zone plumes to define the extent of contaminant migration, and to develop conceptual models of processes governing the transformation, retardation, and overall transport of tank waste residuals. Laboratory studies with sediments so collected have shown that ion exchange, precipitation and dissolution, and surface complexation reactions have occurred between the HLW and subsurface sediments moderating their chemical character, and retarding the migration of select contaminants. Processes suspected to facilitate the far-field migration of immobile radionuclides including stable aqueous complex formation and mobile colloids were found to be potentially operative, but unlikely to occur in the field, with the exception of cyanide-facilitated migration of 60Co. Fission product oxyanions are the most mobile of tank waste constituents because their adsorption is suppressed by large concentrations of waste anions; the vadose zone clay fraction is negative in surface charge; and, unlike Cr, their reduced forms are unstable in oxidizing environments. Reaction/process-based transport modeling is beginning to be used for predictions of future contaminant mobility and plume evolution.","","","Pacific Northwest National Lab.

Here, HCCD/PEG was ?-irradiated to various absorbed doses, to a maximum of 432 kGy, using 60Co. Irradiations were performed for the neat organic phase, and also for the organic phase in contact with 1M-nitric acid mixed by air sparging. Post-irradiation solvent extraction measurements showed that Cs distribution ratios were unaffected, however, strontium distribution ratios decreased with absorbed dose under both conditions. The decrease in extraction efficiency for strontium was greater when in contact with the aqueous phase. Stripping performance was not affected. A mechanism, based on reaction with the products of direct diluent radiolysis is proposed to explain the decreases in strontium extraction efficiency.","","","Idaho National Lab.

The assessment followed the Resource Conservation and Recovery Act (RCRA) Corrective Action process to address the impacts of past tank waste releases to the vadose zone at the single-shell tank farm. Numerical models were developed that consider the extent of contamination presently within the vadose zone and predict contaminant movement through the vadose zone to groundwater. The transport of representative mobile (technetium-99) and immobile (cesium-137) constituents was evaluated in modeling. The model considered the accelerated movement of moisture around and beneath single-shell tanks that is attributed to bare, gravel surfaces resulting from the construction of the underground storage tanks. Infiltration, possibly nearing 100 mm yr{sup -1}, is further amplified in the tank farm because of the umbrella effect created by percolating moisture being diverted by the impermeable, sloping surface of the large, 24-m-diameter, buried tank domes. For both the base case (no-action alternative) simulation and a simulation that considered placement of an interim surface barrier to minimize infiltration, predicted, groundwater concentrations for technetium-99 at the SX tank farm boundary were exceedingly high, on the order of 10{sup 6} pCi L{sup -1}. The predicted concentrations are, however, somewhat conservative because of our use of two-dimensional modeling for a three-dimensional problem. A series of simulations were performed, using recharge rates of 50, 30, and 10 mm yr{sup -1}, and compared to the basecase(100 mm yr{sup -1}) results. As expected, lowering meteoric recharge delayed peak arrival times and reduced peak concentrations at the tank farm boundary.","","","Hanford Site (HNF), Richland, WA (United States)","USDOE - Office of Environmental Management (EM)","","United States","2007-11-01T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: VADOSE ZONE JOURNAL - Published On-Line 11/2007; Journal Volume: 6; Journal Issue: 4","","Medium: ED","","RPP-35977 Rev 0","DE-AC27-99RL14047","TRN: US0800982","10.2136/vzj2006.0176","","2018-01-30T00:00:00Z","922131","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/922131","https://www.osti.gov/servlets/purl/922131","VADOSE ZONE JOURNAL - Published On-Line 11/2007","4","6"

The proposed change is to route dissolved PuCS material directly to a uranium (U) storage tank. As a result, the PuCS solution will bypass Head End and First U Cycle, and will be purified by solvent extraction in Second U Cycle. The PuCS solution contains appreciable amounts of boron (B) and fluoride (F{sup -}), which are currently at trace levels in the U storage tank. Though unlikely, if the B concentration in the U storage tank were to reach 1.8 g B/g U, the entire contents of the U storage tank would likely require a second pass through Second U Cycle to provide sufficient decontamination to meet the Tennessee Valley Authority (TVA) Blend Grade Highly Enriched Uranium (HEU) specification for B, which is 30 {micro}g/g U. In addition, Second U Cycle is expected to provide sufficient decontamination of F{sup -} and Pu regardless of the amount of PuCS solution sent to the storage tank. Though aluminum (Al) is not present in the PuCS solution, B can be credited as a complexant of F{sup -}. Both stability constants from the literature and Savannah River National Laboratory (SRNL) corrosion studies were documented to demonstrate that B complexation of F{sup -} in nitric acid solutions is sufficient to prevent excessive corrosion. Though B and Al complex F{sup -} to a similar degree, neither completely eliminates the presence of free F{sup -} in solution. Therefore, a limited amount of corrosion is expected even with complexed F{sup -} solutions. Tanks maintained at ambient temperature are not expected to experience significant corrosion. However, the Low Activity Waste (LAW) evaporators may be subjected to a corrosion rate of about 25 mils per year (mpy) as they reach their highest F{sup -} concentrations. The feed adjustment evaporator would only be subjected to the corrosion rate of about 25 mpy in the latter stages of the PuCS campaign. An issue that must be addressed as part of the proposed PuCS flowsheet change is that B has limited solubility in concentrated nitric acid solutions. As the proposed PuCS campaign progresses, the B concentration will increase in the U storage tank, in Second U Cycle feed, and in the 1DW stream sent to the LAW evaporators. Limitations on the B concentration in the LAW evaporators will be needed to prevent formation of boron-containing solids.","","available","Savannah River Site (SRS), Aiken, SC (United States)","USDOE","","United States","2007-10-22T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: Separations Science and Technology","","Medium: ED","","WSRC-STI-2007-00381","DE-AC09-08SR22470","TRN: US1001979","","","2010-04-15T00:00:00Z","972202","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/972202","https://www.osti.gov/servlets/purl/972202","Separations Science and Technology","",""

Plutonium (Pu) scraps and residues which do not meet criteria for conversion to a mixed oxide fuel will be dissolved and the solution stored for subsequent disposition. Some of the items scheduled for dissolution are composite materials containing Pu and tantalum (Ta) metals. The preferred approach for handling this material is to dissolve the Pu metal, rinse the Ta metal with water to remove residual acid, and burn the Ta metal. The use of a 4 M nitric acid (HNO{sub 3}) solution containing 0.2 M potassium fluoride (KF) was initially recommended for the dissolution of approximately 500 g of Pu metal. However, prior to the use of the flowsheet in the SRS facility, a new processing plan was proposed in which the feed to the dissolver could contain up to 1250 g of Pu metal. To evaluate the use of a larger batch size and subsequent issues associated with the precipitation of plutonium-containing solids from the dissolving solution, scaled experiments were performed using Pu metal and samples of the composite material. In the initial experiment, incomplete dissolution of a Pu metal sample demonstrated that a 1250 g batch size was not feasible in the HB-Line dissolver. Approximately 45% of the Pu was solubilized in 4 h. The remaining Pu metal was converted to plutonium oxide (PuO{sub 2}). Based on this work, the dissolution of 500 g of Pu metal using a 4-6 h cycle time was recommended for the HB-Line facility. Three dissolution experiments were subsequently performed using samples of the Pu/Ta composite material to demonstrate conditions which reduced the risk of precipitating a double fluoride salt containing Pu and K from the dissolving solution. In these experiments, the KF concentration was reduced from 0.2 M to either 0.15 or 0.175 M. With the use of 4 M HNO{sub 3} and a reduction in the KF concentration to 0.175 M, the dissolution of 300 g of Pu metal is expected to be essentially complete in 6 h. The dissolution of larger batch sizes would result in the formation of PuO{sub 2} solids. Incomplete dissolution of the PuO{sub 2} formed from the metal is not a solubility limitation, but can be attributed to a combination of reduced acidity and complexation of fluoride which slows the dissolution kinetics and effectively limits the mass of Pu dissolved.","","available","Savannah River Site (SRS), Aiken, SC (United States)","USDOE","","United States","2007-10-15T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: Separations Science and Technology","","Medium: ED","","WSRC-STI-2007-00583","DE-AC09-08SR22470","TRN: US1001978","","","2010-04-15T00:00:00Z","972201","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/972201","https://www.osti.gov/servlets/purl/972201","Separations Science and Technology","",""

S. Department of Energy Office of Fissile Material Disposition. This configuration consists of a high-level waste (HLW) canister fitted with a rack that holds mini-canisters containing a Pu-bearing lanthanide borosilicate (LaBS) waste glass and/or ceramic (~15% of the total canister volume). The larger canister is then filled with HLW glass, SRL-202, (~85% of the total canister volume). A 6-year pressurized unsaturated flow (PUF) test was conducted to investigate waste form/waste form interactions that may occur when water penetrates the canisters and contacts the waste forms. Volumetric water content was observed to increase steadily during PUF testing from accumulation of water mass as waters of hydration associated with alteration phases formed on the glass surface. Periodic excursions in effluent pH, electrical conductivity, and solution chemistry were monitored and correlated with the formation of a clay phase(s) during the test. Thermodynamic modeling of select effluent solution samples suggests the dominant secondary reaction product for the SRL-202 glass is a smectite di-octahedral clay phase(s), possibly nontronite [Na0.33Fe2(AlSi)4O10(OH)2•n(H2O)] or beidellite [Na0.33Al2.33Si3.67O10(OH)2]. This phase was identified in SEM images as discrete spherical particles found growing out of a gel-layer on reacted SRL-202 glass. Plutonium analyses of filtered and unfiltered solutions indicate that >80% of the Pu exiting the PUF system is as filterable particulates. In this advection-dominated system, Pu is migrating principally as colloids after being released from the LaBS glass. Analysis of reacted LaBS glass using SEM-EDS illustrates that Pu has segregated into a discrete disk-like phase, possibly PuO2. Alteration products that contain the neutron absorber Gd have not been positively identified. Separation of the Pu and its neutron absorbers during glass dissolution and transport is a potential criticality concern in the proposed repository. However, the translation and interpretation of these long-term PUF test results to actual disposed waste packages requires further analysis.","","","Pacific Northwest National Lab.

This formulation has favorable extraction efficiency for Cs and Sr from acidic solution, and was investigated here for ?-radiation stability. When FPEX was irradiated in contact with aqueous nitric acid, extraction efficiency decreased only slightly when irradiated to absorbed doses as high as 200 kGy. The color of the organic phase changed to a deep yellow-orange, and several new peaks related to radiolysis of the Cs-7SB modifier were detected by GC-ECD analysis. This had little effect on solvent extraction distribution ratios. Possible reasons for this unexpected robustness under conditions of high radiation and acidity are discussed.","","","Idaho National Lab.

Local populations of fall Chinook salmon were exposed to Hanford Site source groundwater that was diluted with Columbia River water. Specific endpoints included survival, development rate, and growth. Tissue burdens of fish were also measured to estimate uptake and elimination rates of chromium. Survival, development, and growth of early life stage fall Chinook salmon were not adversely affected by extended exposures (i.e., 98 day) to hexavalent chromium ranging from 0.79 to 260 μg/L. Survival for all treatment levels and controls exceeded 98% at termination of the test. In addition, there were no differences among the mean lengths and weights of fish among all treatment groups. Whole-body concentrations of chromium in early life stage fall Chinook salmon had a typical dose-response pattern; i.e., those subjected to highest exposure concentrations and longest exposure intervals had higher tissue concentrations. Given the spatial extent of chromium concentrations at the Hanford Site, and the dynamics of the groundwater - river water interface, the current cleanup criterion of 10 µg/L chromium appear adequate to protect fall Chinook salmon populations.","","","Pacific Northwest National Lab.

But the emergence of new R&D programs points to a need to understand how best to plan for a long-term fuel development program. The rationale for such a program is not easily found in the literature, so the authors have suggested a structure and rationale. The approach is described as four phases, with emphasis on selecting a reference fuel concept, evaluating and improving the fuel to develop a Fuel Specification for a reference design, obtaining data to support a licensing safety case for the fuel, and final qualification of the fuel for a specific application. Because a fuel program requires long-lead-time irradiation testing, bringing a fuel design from the initial concept through licensing might take over 20 years.","","","Idaho National Lab.

The Project finished emptying the aging K East Basin of both sludge and the last pieces of scrap spent nuclear fuel. It also Completed vacuuming the bulk of the sludge in the K West Basin into underwater containers. The 54-year-old concrete basins once held more than four million pounds of spent nuclear fuel and sit less than 400 yards from the Columbia River. Each basin holds more than a million gallons of radioactive water. In 2004, Fluor finished removing all the spent nuclear fuel from the K Basins. Nearly 50 cubic meters of sludge remained--a combination of dirt, sand, small pieces of corroded uranium fuel and fuel cladding, corrosion products from racks and canisters, ion-exchange resin beads, polychlorinated biphenyls, and fission products that had formed during the decades that the spent nuclear fuel was stored underwater. Capturing the sludge into underwater containers in the K East Basin took more than two years, and vacuuming the much smaller volume of sludge into containers in the K West Basin required seven months. Workers stood on grating above the basin water and vacuumed the sludge through long, heavy hoses. The work was complicated by murky water and contaminated solid waste (debris). Pumping was paused several times to safely remove and package debris that totaled more than 370 tons. In October 2006, Fluor Hanford workers began pumping the sludge captured in the K East Basin containers out through a specially designed pipeline to underwater containers in the K West Basin, about a half mile away. They used a heavy but flexible, double-walled ''hose-in-hose'' system. Pumping work progressed slowly at first, but ramped up in spring 2007 and was completed on May 31. Just a week before sludge transfers finished, the KBC Project removed the last few small pieces of irradiated fuel (about 19 pounds) found as the last remnants of sludge were vacuumed up. The fuel was loaded into a cask that sat underwater. The cask was hoisted out of the water, decontaminated, and transported to the K West Basin, where it is now being stored underwater until it can be dried and taken to storage in central Hanford. Removing the sludge and fuel from the K East Basin eliminated the final major radioactive sources there, and made the Columbia River and the adjacent environment safer for everyone who lives downstream. Fluor's priority at the K East Basin quickly turned to final preparations for demolishing the structure. Final activities to sort debris are progressing, along with plans to de-water the basin and turn it to rubble in the next two years. At the K West Basin, after the bulk sludge was removed July 3, workers began preparing to load out the last of the ''found'' nuclear fuel and to complete final pass sludge collection this coming year.","","","Hanford Site (HNF), Richland, WA (United States)","USDOE - Office of Environmental Management (EM)","","United States","2007-08-20T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: AMERICAN NUCLEAR SOCIETY (ANS) DD& R NEWSLETTER FALL 2007 EDITION; Journal Issue: FALL 2007","","Medium: ED","","HNF-34812 REV 0","DE-AC06-96RL13200","TRN: US0800658","","","2009-12-16T00:00:00Z","913183","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/913183","https://www.osti.gov/servlets/purl/913183","AMERICAN NUCLEAR SOCIETY (ANS) DD& R NEWSLETTER FALL 2007 EDITION","FALL 2007",""

Fuel is being driven to higher burnups that may influence the source term in cask accidents. To achieve these burnups the manufacturers are introducing new assembly designs and cladding alloys. As a result, at the higher burnups (≥ 50 GWd/MTU) some of the characteristics of the fuel pellets, cladding, and assembly design used in the safety analysis have changed. The fuel pellet has developed a fine grained, Pu rich rim zone on its exterior surface. The source term may increase by 1 – 3 orders of magnitude depending on the fracture characteristics of the rim. The cladding may acquire hydrogen contents up to 700 wppm during the increased exposure. Embrittlement with subsequent lose of ductility may occur, especially if there is hydride reorientation. As a result, there may be a greater propensity for fracture of the rods upon impact with subsequent release of fuel particulate and gas. Significantly improved source terms can be developed if additional data on fuel rim fracture as a function of impact energy, the dependence of cladding ductility for Zircaloy and the newer cladding alloys as a function of hydride reorientation, and release characteristics for fractured rods were obtained. CRUD spallation characteristics only make a significant contribution to the source term if the rods do not fracture in the accident or if a fire only accident occurs.","","","Pacific Northwest National Lab.

The bins are designed to produce the lowest minimum detectable counts (MDC) using a spectral comparison ratio technique at a given false positive rate, for a specified population of benign-source spectra. Spectra from the benign source population consist of observations taken by a detector on a moving vehicle, as would be obtained during a search for a missing or hidden source. Raw counts in bins are transformed into a vector of background-corrected count differences. Bin boundaries are determined to yield large values of a standardized length of this vector for benign-plus-benchmark sources by the application of an optimization technique. The objective function includes penalties for overlap with the spectral features of naturally occurring radioactive materials. We compare estimated MDC values for such bins applied to depleted uranium and barium-133 sources with those based on gross counting, and we examine the effect of nuisance potassium-, radium- and thorium-dominated sources. We demonstrate that, using this methodology, energy bins may be designed for sensitivity to special nuclear materials, improving the likelihood of detection in low-count or masked-source searches.","","","Pacific Northwest National Lab.

In 30-day batch experiments, only a small fraction of total U (~7.4%) was released to artificial groundwater solutions equilibrated with 1% pCO<sub>2</sub>. Synchrotron-based micro X-ray fluorescence spectroscopy analyses showed that U was distributed among at least two types of species: 1) U discrete grains associated with Cu, and 2) areas with intermediate U concentrations on grains and grain coatings. Metatorbernite (Cu[UO<sub>2</sub>]<sub>2</sub>[PO<sub>4</sub>]<sub>2</sub>•8H<sub>2</sub>O) and uranophane (Ca[UO<sub>2</sub>]<sub>2</sub>[SiO<sub>3</sub>(OH)]<sub>2</sub>•5H<sub>2</sub>O) at some U discrete grains, and muscovite at U intermediate concentration areas were identified in synchrotron-based micro X-ray diffraction. SEM/EDS analyses revealed 8-10 µm size metatorbernite particles that were embedded in C-, Al-, and Si-rich coatings on quartz and albite grains. In μ- and bulk-X-ray Absorption Structure (μ-XAS and XAS) spectroscopy analyses, the structure of metatorbernite with additional U-C and U-U coordination environments were consistently observed at U discrete grains with high U concentrations. The consistency of the μ- and bulk-XAS analyses suggests that metatorbernite may comprise a significant fraction of the total U in the sample. The entrapped, micron-sized metatorbernite particles in C, Al, and Si rich coatings, along with the more soluble precipitated uranyl carbonates and uranophane, likely control the long-term release of U to water associated with the vadose zone sediments.","","","Pacific Northwest National Lab.

Batch experiments were performed in a non-growth bicarbonate medium with lactate as electron donor at pH 7 buffered with PIPES. Calcium increased both the rate and extent of Na-boltwoodite dissolution by increasing its solubility through the formation of a ternary aqueous calcium-uranyl-carbonate species. The ternary species, however, decreased the rates of microbial reduction of aqueous U(VI). Laser-induced fluorescence spectroscopy (LIFS) and transmission electron microscopy (TEM) revealed that microbial reduction of solid phase U(VI) is a sequentially coupled process of Na-boltwoodite dissolution, U(VI) aqueous speciation, and microbial reduction of dissolved U(VI) to U(IV) that accumulated on bacterial surfaces/periplasm. The overall rates of microbial reduction of solid phase U(VI) can be described by the coupled rates of dissolution and microbial reduction that were both influenced by calcium. The results demonstrated that dissolved U(VI) concentration during microbial reduction was a complex function of solid phase U(VI) dissolution kinetics, aqueous U(VI) speciation, and microbial activity.","","","Pacific Northwest National Lab.

As prime nuclear waste cleanup contractor at the vast Hanford Site in southeastern Washington state, Fluor Hanford has changed the face of cleanup. Fluor beginning on October 1, 1996, Hanford Site cleanup was primarily a ''paper exercise.'' The Tri-Party Agreement, officially called the Hanford Federal Facility Agreement and Consent Order - the edict governing cleanup among the DOE, U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) and Washington state - was just seven years old. Milestones mandated in the agreement up until then had required mainly waste characterization, reporting, and planning, with actual waste remediation activities off in the future. Real work, accessing waste ''in the field'' - or more literally in huge underground tanks, decaying spent fuel POO{approx}{approx}S, groundwater, hundreds of contaminated facilities, solid waste burial grounds, and liquid waste disposal sites -began in earnest under Fluor Hanford. The fruits of labors initiated, completed and/or underway by Fluor Hanford can today be seen across the site. Spent nuclear fuel is buttoned up in secure, dry containers stored away from regional water resources, reactive plutonium scraps are packaged in approved containers, transuranic (TRU) solid waste is being retrieved from burial trenches and shipped offsite for permanent disposal, contaminated facilities are being demolished, contaminated groundwater is being pumped out of aquifers at record rates, and many other inventive solutions are being applied to Hanford's most intransigent nuclear wastes. (TRU) waste contains more than 100 nanocuries per gram, and contains isotopes higher than uranium on the Periodic Table of the Elements. (A nanocurie is one-billionth of a curie.) At the same time, Fluor Hanford has dramatically improved safety records, and cost effectively maintained and streamlined infrastructure and equipment that is impossibly old and in many cases ''extinct'' in terms of spare parts and vendor support. The story of Fluor's achievements at the Hanford Site - the oldest and most productive plutonium site in the world - is both inspiring and instructive.","","","Hanford Site (HNF), Richland, WA (United States)","USDOE - Office of Environmental Management (EM)","","United States","2007-05-24T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: NUCLEAR FUTURES PUBLISHED IN UNITED KINGDOM","","Medium: ED","","HNF-33947 Rev 0","DE-AC06-96RL13200","TRN: US0703657","","","2009-12-16T00:00:00Z","908292","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/908292","https://www.osti.gov/servlets/purl/908292","NUCLEAR FUTURES PUBLISHED IN UNITED KINGDOM","",""

The process involves the conversion of oxide fuel to metal by electrolytic means, which would then enable subsequent separation and recovery of actinides via existing electrometallurgical technologies, i.e., electrorefining. Four electrolytic reduction runs were performed at bench scale using ~500 ml of molten LiCl – 1 wt% Li2O electrolyte at 650 ºC. In each run, ~50 g of crushed spent oxide fuel was loaded into a permeable stainless steel basket and immersed into the electrolyte as the cathode. A spiral wound platinum wire was immersed into the electrolyte as the anode. When a controlled electric current was conducted through the anode and cathode, the oxide fuel was reduced to metal in the basket and oxygen gas was evolved at the anode. Salt samples were extracted before and after each electrolytic reduction run and analyzed for fuel and fission product constituents. The fuel baskets following each run were sectioned and the fuel was sampled, revealing an extent of uranium oxide reduction in excess of 98%.","","","Idaho National Lab.

At AWE, we have developed such a process using Ca3(PO4)2 as the host material. Successful trials of the process with actinide- and Cl-bearing Type I waste were carried out at PNNL where the immobilization of the waste in a form resistant to aqueous leaching was confirmed. Normalized mass losses determined at 40°C and 28 days were 12 x 10-6 g∙m-2 and 2.7 x 10-3 g∙m-2 for Pu and Cl, respectively. Accelerated radiation-induced damage effects are being determined with specimens containing 238Pu. No changes in the crystalline lattice have been detected with XRD after the 239Pu equivalent of 400 years ageing. Confirmation of the process for Type II waste (a oxyhydroxide-based waste) is currently underway at PNNL. Differences in the ionic state of Pu in the four types of waste have required different surrogates to be used. Samarium chloride was used successfully as a surrogate for both Pu(III) and Am(III) chlorides. Initial investigations into the use of HfO2 as the surrogate for Pu(IV) oxide in Type II waste indicated no significant differences.","","","Pacific Northwest National Lab.

Some recent experiments and theoretical estimates indicate that dust particles can provide an important source of impurities in the tokamak plasma. Moreover, dust can be a serious threat to the safety of next-step fusion devices. In this paper, recent experimental observations on dust in fusion devices are reviewed. A physical model for dust transport simulation, and a newly developed code DUSTT, are discussed. The DUSTT code incorporates both dust dynamics due to comprehensive dust-plasma interactions as well as the effects of dust heating, charging, and evaporation. The code tracks test dust particles in realistic plasma backgrounds as provided by edge-plasma transport codes. Results are presented for dust transport in current and next-step tokamaks.

Abiotic reduction of soluble Tc(VII) by Fe(II)(aq) in pH 6-8 solutions was investigated under strictly anoxic conditions using an oxygen trap (<7.5 10-9atm O2) in the absence of atmospheric or aqueous carbonate. The reduction kinetics were strongly pH dependent. Complete and rapid reduction of Tc(VII) to a precipitated Tc(IV)/Fe form was observed when 11 µmol/L of Tc(VII) was reacted with 0.4 mmol/L Fe(II) at pH 7.0 and 8.0, while no significant reduction was observed over 1 month at pH 6.0. Experiments conducted at pH 7.0 with Fe(II)(aq) = 0.05-0.8 mmol/L further revealed that Tc(VII) reduction was a combination of homogeneous and heterogeneous reaction. The heterogeneous reaction was more rapid, but not quantified. The kinetics of homogeneous reduction were slow at pH 7, but increased dramatically at pH 8, and correlated with the concentration of Fe(OH)+ and Fe(OH)2o(aq). Wet chemical and Fe-x-ray absorption near edge spectroscopy measurements (XANES) indicated that both Fe(II) and Fe(III) were present in the Fe/Tc(IV) redox reaction products. 57Fe- Mössbauer, extended x-ray adsorption fine structure (EXAFS), and transmission electron microscopy (TEM) measurements on the solid phase redox products that contained 13-15% Tc indicated that they were poorly ordered and dominated by Fe(II)-containing ferrihydrite with minor magnetite. Tc(IV) exhibited homogeneous spatial distribution within the precipitates. According to Tc-EXAFS measurements and structural modeling, its molecular environment was consistent with a Tc2O10 octahedral dimer bound in bidentate edge-sharing mode to an octahedral FeO6 surface or vacancy site in ferrihydrite. The precipitate maintained Tc(IV)aq concentrations that were slightly below those in equilibrium with amorphous Tc(IV)O2•nH2O(s). The oxidation rate of sorbed Tc(IV) in the Fe/Tc precipitate was considerably slower than Tc(IV)O2•nH2O(s) as a result of its intraparticle/intragrain residence. It is suggested that precipitates of this nature may form in anoxic sediments or groundwaters, and that the intraparticle residence of sorbed/precipitated Tc(IV) may limit 99Tc remobilization upon the return of oxidizing conditions.","The Geochemical Society; The Meteoritical Society","","Pacific Northwest National Lab.

Concrete encasement is one method being considered for containment of low-level radioactive wastes. The necessary data to conduct an accurate performance assessment of such a waste form requires understanding the behavior and interactions of the radionuclides with the concrete matrix. The formation of uranium mineral phases has been investigated in simulated concrete pore fluids and Ordinary Portland Cement/Pulverized Fuel Ash (fly ash) concrete waste forms. X-Ray diffraction analyses of uranium precipitates from concrete pore fluids suggest diuranate salts, uranium-oxyhydroxides, and –silicates as solubility limiting phases. Scanning electron microscopy – energy dispersive spectroscopic analyses of uranium-spiked concrete suggests that under conditions both under-saturated and over-saturated with respect to the formation of uranium mineral phases, uranyl-oxyhydroxide phases precipitate within the initial two weeks. Subsequently, uranyl-silicate phases form after approximately one month and uranyl-phosphate phases provide a significant contribution to the long-term control over uranium in concrete waste forms after two months. This investigation demonstrates the importance of investigating the solubility of complex contaminants such as uranium in the complete matrix (i.e. concrete matrix versus pore fluids) and suggests the importance of secondary uranium mineral phases in the long-term retention within concrete waste forms.","","","Pacific Northwest National Lab.

These include plutonium and minor actinides such as americium and curium. In preparation for geological disposal there is a consensus that actinides that have been separated from spent nuclear fuel should be immobilised within mineral-based ceramics rather than glass. Over the long-term, the alpha-decay taking place in these ceramics will severely disrupt their crystalline structure and reduce their durability. A fundamental property in predicting cumulative radiation damage is the number of atoms permanently displaced per alpha–decay. Currently, this number is estimated as 1000-2000 atoms/alpha decay event. Here, we report nuclear magnetic resonance, spin-counting experiments that measure close to 5000 atoms/alpha decay event in radiation damaged natural zircons. New radiological NMR measurements on highly radioactive, 239Pu zircon show damage similar to that created by 238U and 232Th in mineral zircons at the same dose, indicating no significant effect of dose rate. Based on these measurements, the initially crystalline structure of a 10 wt% 239Pu zircon would be amorphous after only 1400 years in a geological repository. These measurements establish a basis for assessing the long-term structural durability of actinide-containing ceramics based on an atomistic understanding of the fundamental damage event.","","","Pacific Northwest National Lab.

"Equations of State and Phase Transformation of Depleted Uranium DU-238 by High Pressure-Temperature Diffraction Studies","Zhao, Y; Zhang, J; Brown, D; Korzekwa, D; Hixson, R","11 NUCLEAR FUEL CYCLE AND FUEL MATERIALS; DEPLETED URANIUM; DIFFRACTION; EQUATIONS OF STATE; PHASE TRANSFORMATIONS; THERMAL EXPANSION; URANIUM; national synchrotron light source","We have conducted in situ high-pressure diffraction experiments on depleted uranium (DU-238) at pressures up to 8.5 GPa and temperatures up to 1123 K. From the pressure (P)-volume (V)-temperature (T) measurements, thermoelastic parameters were derived for a-uranium based on a modified high-T Birch-Murnaghan equation of state and a thermal-pressure approach. With the pressure derivative of the bulk modulus K0' fixed at 4.0, we obtained ambient bulk modulus K0=117(2) GPa, temperature derivative of bulk modulus at constant pressure ({partial_derivative}K/{partial_derivative}T)P=-3.4(4)x10-2 GPa/K and at constant volume ({partial_derivative}K/{partial_derivative}T)v=-1.1(6)x10-2 GPa/K, volumetric thermal expansivity aT=a+bT, with a=1.2({+-}0.4)x10-5 K-1 and b=8.0({+-}0.7)x10-8 K-2, and the pressure derivative of thermal expansion ({partial_derivative}a/{partial_derivative}P)T=-2.5(5)x10-6 GPa-1 K-1. Within the experimental errors, the ambient bulk modulus and volumetric thermal expansion derived from this work are in good agreement with previous experimental results, whereas all other thermoelastic parameters represent the first determinations for the a phase of uranium. We also studied the a- phase transformation and obtained a phase boundary described by T (in K)=1032+7.4P (in GPa). Although the -phase uranium cannot be pressure quenched to ambient conditions, it was observed to be stable upon cooling from 1123 to 300 K at pressures of 7-8 GPa. These observations indicate that pressure, in addition to the commonly utilized alloying techniques, provides an alternative route for stabilizing the {gamma}-uranium at room temperature.","","","Brookhaven National Lab.

The second method is a crushing technique, in which tubular specimen is fractured by diametrical compressive loading. Tubular SiC specimens with a wall thickness of about 100 {micro}m and inner diameters of about 0.9 mm (SiC-A) and 1 mm (SiC-B) were extracted from surrogate nuclear fuels and tested using the two test methods. Mean fracture stresses of 239, 263, and 283 MPa were measured for SiC-A and SiC-B by internal pressurization, and SiC-A by diametrical loading, respectively. In addition, size effects in the fracture stress were investigated using tubular alumina specimens with various sizes. A significant size effect was found in the experimental data and was also predicted by the effective area-based scaling method.","","","Oak Ridge National Lab.

Faster than expected transport of contaminants in the vadose zone is typically attributed to either physical hydrologic processes such as development of preferential flow pathways, or to geochemical processes such as the formation of stable, anionic complexes with organic chelates, e.g., ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid (EDTA). The goal of this paper is to determine whether hydrological processes in the Hanford sediments can influence the geochemistry of the system and hence control transport of Sr{sup 2+} and SrEDTA{sup 2-}. The study used batch isotherms, saturated packed column experiments, and an unsaturated transport experiment in an undisturbed core. Isotherms and repacked column experiments suggested that the SrEDTA{sup 2-} complex was unstable in the presence of Hanford sediments, resulting in dissociation and transport of Sr{sup 2+} as a divalent cation. A decrease in sorption with increasing solid:solution ratio for Sr{sup 2+} and SrEDTA{sup 2-} suggested mineral dissolution resulted in competition for sorption sites and the formation of stable aqueous complexes. This was confirmed by detection of MgEDTA{sup 2-}, MnEDTA{sup 2-}, PbEDTA{sup 2-}, and unidentified Sr and Ca complexes. Displacement of Sr{sup 2+} through a partially-saturated undisturbed core resulted in less retardation and more irreversible sorption than was observed in the saturated repacked columns, and model results suggested a significant reservoir (49%) of immobile water was present during transport through the heterogeneous layered sediments. The undisturbed core was subsequently disassembled along distinct bedding planes and subjected to sequential extractions. Strontium was unequally distributed between carbonates (49%), ion exchange sites (37%), and the oxide (14%) fraction. An inverse relationship between mass wetness and Sr suggested that sandy sediments of low water content constituted the immobile flow regime. Our results suggested that the sequestration of Sr{sup 2+} in partially-saturated, heterogeneous sediments was most likely due to the formation of immobile water in drier regions having low hydraulic conductivities.","","","Oak Ridge National Lab.

The fracture strength measured from each test method applying the Weibull two-parameter distribution, and Weibull parameters measured. It was shown that data generated with each test technique were independent of the test technique applied. This implies the developed test methods are reliable and provide reasonable strength data. For the same material, fracture strength varied with the specimen geometry and loading configuration. This size and loading configuration effects on the fracture strength are explained with the concept of effective surface.","","","Oak Ridge National Lab.

The solid phase in many regimes on the site has been exposed to highly buffered acidic (&lt;3.5) groundwater and has been aggressively weathered. Higher correlations occur between U{sub NA} and total P and S (r{sup 2} = 0.76, 0.69, respectively), citrate bicarbonate dithionite extractable Fe (Fed) and Al (Ald) (r{sup 2}=0.87, 0.80, respectively), and acid oxalate extractable or amorphous/poorly crystalline Fe (Feo) (r{sup 2}=0.63) in core material from a field plot known as Area 1 compared to core material from another field plot known as Area 3. In Area 3 core material, linear regression analysis of UNA and total P and S, and Fed, Ald and Feo gave r{sup 2} values of 0.67, 0.4, 0.06, 0.24, and 0.45, respectively. These results showed similar relationships with SEM-wavelength dispersive spectroscopy (WDS) mapping of this material. It is noteworthy that Area 1 geological material has not been as aggressively weathered as Area 3 material due to its physical location from the waste source. In all of the cores, most of the Fe and Al oxides were crystalline, while most of the Mn oxides were amorphous. The greater adsorption and/or fixation of anion complexes of P-U (uranium phosphate) and S onto Fe and Al oxides from Area 1 cores compared to Area 3 core material is probably due to a higher amount of crystalline Fe and Al oxides compared to amorphous Fe and Al oxides and higher Al substitution in Fe oxides in Area 1. This unique study illustrates the relationships between U{sub NA}, total P and S, and Al, Fe and Mn oxides in fractured shale under field conditions which can be used in planning remediation of this site and other similar sites.","","","Oak Ridge National Lab.

C.","11 NUCLEAR FUEL CYCLE AND FUEL MATERIALS; FISSION PRODUCTS; NUCLEAR FUELS; OXYGEN; SOLID SOLUTIONS; THERMODYNAMIC MODEL; THERMODYNAMICS; URANIUM; URANIUM DIOXIDE","Many projects involving nuclear fuel rest on a quantitative understanding of the co-existing phases at various stages of burnup. Since the many fission products have considerably different abilities to chemically associate with oxygen, and the oxygen-to-metal molar ratio is slowly changing, the chemical potential of oxygen is a function of burnup. Concurrently, well-recognized small fractions of new phases such as inert gas, noble metals, zirconates, etc. also develop. To further complicate matters, the dominant UO2 fuel phase may be non-stoichiometric and most of the minor phases themselves have a variable composition dependent on temperature and possible contact with the coolant in the event of a sheathing breach. A thermodynamic fuel model to predict the phases in partially burned CANDU (CANada Deuterium Uranium) nuclear fuel containing many major fission products has been under development. The building blocks of the model are the standard Gibbs energies of formation of the many possible compounds expressed as a function of temperature. To these data are added mixing terms associated with the appearance of the component species in particular phases.

The model is capable of handling non-stoichiometry in the UO2 fluorite phase, dilute solution behaviour of significant solute oxides, noble metal inclusions, a second metal solid solution U(Pd-Rh-Ru)3, zirconate, molybdate, and uranate solutions as well as other minor solid phases, and volatile gaseous species.","","","Oak Ridge National Lab.

To fulfill this mission during the past 50 years SRS has operated five nuclear reactors, two large chemical separation areas, waste disposal facilities (landfills, waste ponds, waste tanks, and waste stabilization), and a large number of research and logistics support facilities. Contaminants of concern (COC) resulting from site operations include chlorinated solvents, radionuclides, metals, and metalloids, often found as complex mixtures that greatly complicate remediation efforts when compared with civilian industries. The objective of this article is to provide a description of the lithology and hydrostratigraphy of the SRS, as well as a brief history of site operations and research activities as a preface to the current special section of Vadose Zone Journal (VZJ) dedicated to SRS, focusing mainly on issues that are unique to the USDOE complex. Contributions to the special section reflect a diverse range of topics, from hydrologic tracer experiments conducted both within the vadose and saturated zones to studies specifically aimed at identifying geochemical processes controlling the migration and partitioning of specific contaminants (e.g., TCE, {sup 137}Cs, U, and Pu) in SRS subsurface environments. Addressing the diverse environmental challenges of the SRS provides a unique opportunity to conduct both fundamental and applied research across a range of experimental scales. Hence, the SRS has been a pioneering force in several areas of environmental research and remediation, often through active interdisciplinary collaboration with researchers from other USDOE facilities, academic and federal institutions, and commercial entities.","","","Savannah River Ecology Laboratory (SREL), Aiken, SC","USDOE","","United States","2007-01-01T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: Vadose Zone Journal; Journal Volume: 6","","Medium: X; Size: 316-326","","SREL-3038","DE-FC09-07SR22506","TRN: US0703726","10.2136/vzj2007.0044","","2009-12-16T00:00:00Z","908669","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/908669","","Vadose Zone Journal","","6"
"Spatial and Temporal Variability in Colloid Dispersion as a Function of Groundwater Injection Rate within Atlantic Coastal Plain Sediments","Seaman, J.C., P.M. Bertsch and D.I. Kaplan","11 NUCLEAR FUEL CYCLE AND FUEL MATERIALS; CHEMICAL ANALYSIS; PERMEABILITY; SAMPLING; SEDIMENTS; ENVIRONMENTAL TRANSPORT; TURBIDITY; GROUND WATER; SAVANNAH RIVER PLANT; REMEDIAL ACTION; COLLOIDS; MINERALOGY","A subsurface injection experiment was conducted on the USDOE's Savannah River Site (SRS) to determine the influence of pump-and-treat remediation activities on the generation and transport of groundwater colloids. The impact of colloid generation on formation permeability at injection rates ranging from 19 to 132 L min{sup -1} was monitored using a set of six sampling wells radially spaced at approximate distances of 2.0, 3.0, and 4.5 m from a central injection well. Each sampling well was further divided into three discrete sampling depths that were pumped continuously at a rate of {approx}0.1 L min{sup -1} throughout the course of the injection experiment. Discrete samples were collected for turbidity and chemical analysis. Turbidity varied greatly between sampling wells and zones within a given well, ranging from &lt;1 to 740 NTU. The two sampling wells closest to the injection well displayed the greatest response in terms of turbidity to increases in injection rate. Transient spikes in turbidity generally corresponded to incremental increases in the injection rate that were followed by a decrease in turbidity to a stable injection rate-dependent level. Mineralogical analysis of the resulting suspensions confirmed the presence of kaolinite, goethite, and to a much lesser degree, quartz and illite, with many of the particles too large (&gt;1 {micro}m) to be readily mobile within the formation. Turbidity measurements taken during this study indicate that colloid mobilization induced by water injection was both spatially and temporally heterogeneous. Furthermore, colloid release did not follow simple predictions based on shear force, presumably due to the complexities encountered in real heterogeneous systems. These findings have important implications to our understanding of how colloids and the co-contaminants are mobilized in the subsurface environment, as well as for the development of monitoring practices that minimize the creation of colloidal artifacts. Technical and logistical obstacles encountered in conducting such an extensive field experiment are also discussed.","","","Savannah River Ecology Laboratory (SREL), Aiken, SC","USDOE","","United States","2007-01-01T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: Vadose Zone Journal; Journal Volume: 6","","Medium: X; Size: 363-372","","SREL-3039","DE-FC09-07SR22506","TRN: US0703727","10.2136/vzj2006.0048","","2009-12-16T00:00:00Z","908670","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/908670","","Vadose Zone Journal","","6"

The waste is contained in approximately forty-nine tanks fabricated from commercially available carbon steel. In order to minimize general corrosion, the waste is maintained as very-alkaline solution. The very-alkaline chemistry has caused hydrated metal oxides to precipitate and form a sludge heel. Over the years, the sludge waste has aged, with some forming a hardened crust. To aid in the removal of the sludge heels from select tanks for closure the use of oxalic acid to dissolve the sludge is being investigated. Developing an optimized process strategy based on laboratory analyses would be prohibitively costly. This research, therefore, demonstrates that a chemical equilibrium based software program can be used to develop an optimized process strategy for oxalic acid cleaning of the HLW tanks based on estimating resultant chemistries, minimizing resultant oxalates sent to the evaporator, and minimizing resultant solids sent to the Defense Waste Processing Facility (DWPF).","pubinfo","available","Savannah River Site (SRS), Aiken, SC (United States)","USDOE","","United States","2006-12-04T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: Nuclear Technology","","Medium: ED","","WSRC-STI-2006-00330-R1","DE-AC09-96SR18500","Journal ID: ISSN 0029-5450; NUTYBB; TRN: US0700911","","","2009-12-16T00:00:00Z","897090","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/897090","https://www.osti.gov/servlets/purl/897090","Nuclear Technology","",""

Initiating events considered included high-pressure transients of a total loss of feed water (LOFW) and a station blackout (SBO) and low-pressure transients of a 0.0009-m2 small, 0.0093-m2 medium, and 0.0465-m2 large-break loss-of-coolant accident (LOCA) without safety injection. Best-estimate simulations for these low-probability events with conservative accident progression assumptions that lead to reactor vessel failure were performed by using the SCDAP/RELAP5/MOD3.3 computer code. The SCDAP/RELAP5/MOD3.3 results have shown that the pressurizer surge line failed before the reactor vessel failure, which results in a rapid decrease of the in-vessel pressure and a delay of the reactor vessel failure time of ~40 min in the high-pressure sequences of the total LOFW and the SBO transients. In all the sequences, ~80 to 90% of the core material was melted and relocated to the lower plenum of the reactor vessel at the time of reactor vessel failure. The maximum value of the volumetric heat source in the corium pool was estimated as 1.9 to 3.7 MW/m3. The corium temperature was ~2800 to 3400 K at the time of reactor vessel failure. The highest volumetric heat source sequence is predicted for the 0.0465-m2 large-break LOCA without safety injection in the APR1400, because this sequence leads to an early reactor vessel failure.","","","Idaho National Lab.

The dissolution of the precipitates appeared to be controlled by intragrain ion diffusion coupled with the dissolution kinetics of the uranyl precipitates most likely as Na-boltwoodite. Here we presented a coupled microscopic reactive diffusion model by independently characterizing the intragrain diffusion and dissolution kinetics of Na-boltwoodite. Diffusion characterization with a nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) pulse gradient spin-echo (PGSE) technique showed that the intragrain fractures of the granitic clasts in the Hanford sediment contain two domans with distinct diffusivities. The fast diffusion domain has an apparent tortuosity of about 1.5, while the slow region has a tortuosity of two orders of magnitude larger. A two-domain diffusion model was assembled and used to infer the geochemical conditions that led to intragrain uranyl precipitation when the sediment was contaminated by U-containing wastes at the site. Rapid precipitation of Na-boltwoodite was simulated when a U-containing, alkaline caustic, and high carbonate tank waste solution diffused into intragrain fractures originally containing Si-rich solutions. The model was also used to simulate uranyl dissolution and release from the contaminant sediment to aqueous solutions. With independently characterized parameters for Na-boltwoodite dissolution, the model simulations demonstrated that diffusion could significantly decrease the rates of intragrain uranyl mineral dissolution due to diffusion-induced local solubility limitation, and the intragrain uranyl precipitates could serve as a long-term uranyl source for the vadose porewater and underlying groundwater at this site.","","","Pacific Northwest National Lab.

Distribution ratios of Cs, Sr, U, Eu and Am have been measured for various concentrations of diamide, PEG, aqueous phase nitric acid, with various HCCD:diamide ratios, and using different organic diluents. In the absence of HCCD, the diamides show little affinity for the extraction of Am or Eu from nitric acid solutions (distributions typically <1). Addition of HCCD with the diamide extractants indicates a pronounced synergistic effect with regard to actinide and lanthanide extraction; the observed Am and Eu distribution ratios typically increase by several orders of magnitude. Cesium is also appreciably extracted by the HCCD in the presence of the various diamides. Addition of PEG (to simultaneously extract Sr) with HCCD and diamide has minimal impacts on the Eu and Am distribution ratios. The initial data indicate that alkyl substituted DPA derivatives weakly affect the extraction properties with regard to actinides and lanthanides, while aryl substituents decrease extraction ability of the mixture. The results of this preliminary work indicate that numerous HCCD-PEG-DPA systems are promising and effective for the simultaneous extraction Cs, Sr, Am, and Eu from acidic solutions.","","","Idaho National Lab.

This fuel is soon to be retrieved from buried storage and packaged into new containers (overpacks) for interim storage at the Hanford Interim Storage Area (ISA). One of the key activities associated with this effort is final closure of the overpack by welding. The OSU fuel is placed into an overpack, a head inserted into the overpack top, and welded closed. Weld quality, for typical welded fabrication, is established through post-weld testing and nondestructive examination (NDE); however, in this case, once the SNF is placed into the overpack, routine testing and NDE are not feasible. An alternate approach is to develop and qualify the welding process/parameters, demonstrate beforehand that they produce the desired weld quality, and then verify parameter compliance during production welding. Fluor engineers have developed a Gas Tungsten Arc Welding (GTAW) technique and parameters, demonstrating that weld quality requirements for closure of packaged SNF overpacks are met, using this alternate approach. The following reviews the activities performed for this development and qualification effort.","","","Hanford Site (HNF), Richland, WA (United States)","USDOE - Office of Environmental Management (EM)","","United States","2006-09-11T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: RADWASTE SOLUTIONS MAGAZINE","","Medium: ED","","HNF-30634-FP Rev 0","DE-AC06-96RL13200","TRN: US0605473","","","2009-12-16T00:00:00Z","891689","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/891689","https://www.osti.gov/servlets/purl/891689","RADWASTE SOLUTIONS MAGAZINE","",""

Consequently, the solubility of synthetic Na-boltwoodite was determined over a wide range of bicarbonate concentrations, from circumneutral to alkaline pH, that are representative of porewater and groundwater compositions at the Hanford site. Results show that Na-boltwoodite dissolution was nearly congruent and its solubility increased with increasing bicarbonate concentration. Calculated solubility constants varied by nearly 2 log units from low bicarbonate (no added NaCO3) to 50 mmol/L bicarbonate. However, the solubility constants only vary by 0.5 log units from 0 added bicarbonate to 1.2 mmol/L bicarbonate, where logKsp = 5.39-5.92 and the average logKsp = 5.63. No systematic trend in logKsp was apparent over this range in bicarbonate concentrations. LogKsp values trended down with increasing bicarbonate concentration, where logKsp = 4.06 at 50 mmol/L bicarbonate. We conclude that the calculated solubility constants at high bicarbonate are compromised by an incomplete or inaccurate uranyl-carbonate speciation model.","","","Pacific Northwest National Lab.

An NO{sub 2} sparge has been shown to effectively remove Cl{sup -} from solutions containing 6-8 M acid (H{sup +}) and up to 5 M Cl{sup -}. Chloride removal occurs as a result of the competition of at least two reactions, one which is acid-dependent. Below 4 M H+, NO2 reacts with Cl- to produce nitrosyl chloride (ClNO). Between 6 M and 8 M H{sup +}, the reaction of hydrochloric acid (HCl) with nitric acid (HNO{sub 3}), facilitated by the presence of NO{sub 2}, strongly affects the rate of Cl{sup -} removal.

Aerosol concentrations in the head space above the closed tank demonstrated a wide range, varying between 97 ?g m-3 for PM2.5 and 5650 ?g m-3 for TSP. The variation in concentrations was a function of sampling heights, size fraction and sparging rate. Measured aerosol entrainment coefficients showed good agreement with existing entrainment models. The models evaluated generally over predicted the entrainment, but were within a factor of two of the measured entrainment.

The peace dividend has been elusive in many countries. The notion that the world would become a safer and more secure place as nuclear weapons stockpiles were reduced has been trumped by the rise in international terrorism. Hopes that nuclear weapons would lose their salience as markers of elite status among nations along with pressures to acquire them have been dashed. The drive by some countries and terrorist groups to acquire nuclear weapons has not diminished, and the threat of proliferation has increased. At the level of the nation state, the Nonproliferation Treaty (NPT) itself is under pressure as more nations acquire nuclear weapons, de facto weapons states fail to join, and nations that want to acquire them leave or threaten to leave. At the sub-state level, the convergence of terrorism and weapons of mass destruction (WMD) has introduced an element of uncertainty into nonproliferation that is unprecedented. Another feature of the post-cold war era that has taken many by surprise is the continued, and growing need for trained specialists in nonproliferation and nuclear materials management. Contained within the notion of disarmament and reduced strategic importance of nuclear weapons was the expectation of a diminishing workforce of trained nonproliferation and nuclear materials specialists. Events have overtaken this assumption.","","","Pacific Northwest National Lab.

The purpose of the study was to determine appropriate locations for air monitoring equipment in support of sludge water pumping activities. The study revealed a stagnant layer of the air within the transfer area that made predicting movement of contamination within the transfer area difficult. Without conducting an air flow study, the stagnant layer would not have been identified, and could have resulted in locating samplers at inappropriate locations. In a second test, smoke was used to verify the effectiveness of an air space barrier curtain. The results showed that the curtain adequately separated the two air spaces.

These REEs serve both as monitors for evaluating the potential repository behavior of REE radionuclides, and as surrogate elements for actinides (e.g., Ce4 and Nd3 for Pu4 and Am3, respectively). The present experiments examined the behavior of REE in the presence of ianthinite Formula Not Shown, becquerelite (Ca(UO2)6O4(OH)6(H2O)8), and other uranyl hydroxide compounds commonly noted as alteration products during the corrosion of UO2, spent nuclear fuel, and naturally occurring uraninite. The results of these experiments demonstrate that significant quantities of both cerium (Kd=1020) and neodymium (Kd=840) are incorporated within the uranium alteration phases and suggest that ionic substitution and/or adsorption to the uranyl phases can play a key role in the limiting the mobility of REE (and by analogy, actinide elements) in a nuclear waste repository.","","","Pacific Northwest National Lab.

Even many former opponents of nuclear energy are now convinced that nuclear energy is more environmentally friendly than burning fossil fuels. Nuclear energy does not release carbon dioxide to the atmosphere and therefore does not contribute to the global warming problem. But nuclear energy produces spent fuel or nuclear waste. Spent fuel is radioactive and requires thousands of years of isolation from plants, animals and humans. Every country currently studying the option for disposing of high-level nuclear waste has selected deep geologic formations to be the primary barrier for accomplishing this isolation. It is postulated that by the very nature of these geological sites, they will contain the waste for long time, limiting the spread of radionuclides, for example, through water flow. The release of radionuclides to the environment can also be delayed by the construction of engineered barrier systems between the waste and the geologic formation. Corrosion engineers are participating in the design and the performance prediction of the engineered barriers. The principal engineered component in this multibarrier approach is the container for the waste. Beyond the metallic containers, other engineered barriers could be added to attenuate the impact of the emplacement environment on the containers. The containers will probably be concentric double walled vessels of dissimilar metals. Each vessel would have a specific function. For example, the inner container may be designed to shield radiation and provide structural support to facilitate the safe handling and emplacement operations. This inner container may be over-packed with a corrosion-resistant outer layer. The design of the different containers for nuclear waste would vary according to the nature of the geologic formation at the site of the repository. The most common host rocks for nuclear waste repositories in the world are clay, basalt, tuff and granite. The groundwater associated with the containers should all be relatively benign to most materials because of their low ionic strengths, near neutral pH, and low concentrations of halide ions. The corrosiveness of these waters could increase if significant vaporization occurs due to heating from radioactive decay during the early times of emplacement. Many different alloys are currently being studied for the container materials, including carbon steel, stainless steel, titanium, copper, and nickel alloys. Twenty years ago, most of the designs for repositories specified life spans of 300 to 1000 years. Today, some designs are considering lifetimes as high as 1,000,000 years. This requirement has created a difficult problem for engineers to solve. The unique aspect of this problem is associated with making predictions about the corrosion behavior of container materials for extended periods of time. Many of the alloy systems being considered have been in existence for less than 100 years. The understanding and methodologies of existing corrosion engineering remain largely oriented to traditional problems involving less corrosion resistant alloys and corrosion behavior over time periods less than decades. Predicting the behavior of engineering alloys over geologic time periods poses new challenges but at the same time offers new opportunities for the development of corrosion science. Even though nuclear energy has been in use for half a century, no country currently operates a nuclear waste repository. The current renaissance of public interest in nuclear energy may put some pressure on the development of the repositories. Building a nuclear waste repository is a long process since the whole society needs to be ready for it, and nowadays this society may extend beyond country lines. Corrosion engineers can help.","","","Lawrence Livermore National Lab.

In this study, synthetic compounds of zirconolite (CaZrTi2O7) and pyrochlores (Gd2Ti2O7 and Nd2Zr2O7) were fabricated and doped with the short-lived alpha-emitter 244Cm to increase the total amount of helium and damage generated in a laboratory time scale. Helium implantations were also used to simulate the damage caused by the alpha-decay and the build-up of helium in the matrix. The samples were annealed in a Knudsen cell, and the helium release profile interpreted in conjunction with radiation damage studies and previous analysis of annealing behaviour. Several processes like diffusion, trapping or phase changes could then be attributed to the helium behaviour depending on the material considered.

First, almost all of the radioactivity is initially in the waste form, mainly in the spent nuclear fuel (SNF) or nuclear waste glass. Second, over long periods, after the engineered barriers are degraded, the waste form is a primary control on the release of radioactivity. Thus, it is essential to know the physical and chemical state of the waste form after hundreds of thousands of years. The United States Department of Energy's Yucca Mountain Repository Program has initiated a long-term program to develop a basic understanding of the fundamental mechanisms of radionuclide release and a quantification of the release as repository conditions evolve over time. Specifically, the research program addresses four critical areas: (a) SNF dissolution mechanisms and rates; (b) formation and properties of U{sup 6+}-secondary phases; (c) waste form-waste package interactions in the near-field; and (d) integration of in-package chemical and physical processes. The ultimate goal is to integrate the scientific results into a larger scale model of source term and near-field processes. This integrated model will be used to provide a basis for understanding the behavior of the source term over long time periods (greater than 10{sup 5} years). Such a fundamental and integrated experimental and modeling approach to source term processes can also be readily applied to development of advanced waste forms as part of a closed nuclear fuel cycle. Specifically, a fundamental understanding of candidate waste form materials stability in high temperature/high radiation environments and near-field geochemical/hydrologic processes could enable development of advanced waste forms ''tailored'' to specific geologic settings.","","","Yucca Mountain Project, Las Vegas, NV (United States)","USDOE","","United States","2006-06-22T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","","","Medium: ED","","NA","NA","MOL.20060815.0149; DC# 48139; TRN: US0606182","","","2009-12-16T00:00:00Z","893887","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/893887","https://www.osti.gov/servlets/purl/893887","","",""

Recent work at Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory has demonstrated that simple slab neutron detectors and a novel approach to data acquisition and analysis can be used to make an accurate measurement of the mass of fissile materials. Purely passive measurement of kilogram quantities of highly enriched uranium (HEU) have also been shown to be feasible.

The model includes the principal structural components of the laboratory, the neutron source and collimator assembly in which it resides, the assembly that represents cargo of given characteristics, a target of highly-enriched uranium (HEU) and large external plastic scintillators for photon detection. The ability of this model to reproduce experimental measurements was tested by comparing simulations with measurements of the number of induced fissions and the number of detected photons when the HUE target was irradiated with 14.25-MeV neutrons in the absence of any cargo and while embedded in assemblies of plywood and iron pipes. The simulations agreed with experimental measurements within a factor of about 2 for irradiation of the bare target and when the areal density of intervening cargo was 33 g cm{sup -2} (wood) and 61 g cm{sup -2} (steel pipes). This suggests that the model can permit exploration of a large range in parameter space with reasonable fidelity.","","","Lawrence Livermore National Lab.

Specifically, the extractant was studied for an ammonium acetate/acetic acid buffered feed that would result from a transuranic separation process utilizing an ammonium acetate strip solution. Separation factors of 241Am from 154Eu with this extractant, as a function of total acetate concentration and pH, have been measured. Additionally, the extraction behavior of stable La, Ce, Pr, Nd, Sm, and Eu was measured. Separation factors were typically very high for Am from Eu at a pH ranging from 3.8 to 5.8 and a total acetate concentration ranging from 0.2 M to 1.0 M. However, separation factors across the lanthanide series varied considerably and resulted in separation of the lighter lanthanides from the heavier lanthanides at the higher pH’s.","","","Idaho National Lab.

X-ray and electron microprobe imaging showed that the uranium was associated with a minority of clasts, specifically granitic clasts occupying less than four percent of the sediment volume. XANES analysis at micron resolution showed the uranium to be hexavalent. The uranium was precipitated in microfractures as radiating clusters of uranyl silicates, and sorbed uranium was not observed on other surfaces. Compositional determinations of the 1-3 µm precipitates were difficult, but indicated a sodium potassium uranyl silicate, likely sodium boltwoodite. Observations suggested that uranyl was removed from pore waters by diffusion and precipitation in microfractures, where dissolved silica within the granite-equilibrated solution would cause supersaturation with respect to sodium boltwoodite. This hypothesis was tested using a diffusion reaction model operating at microscale. Conditions favoring precipitation were simulated to be transient, and driven by the compositional contrast between pore and fracture space. Pore-space conditions, including alkaline pH, were eventually imposed on the microfracture environment. However, conditions favoring precipitation were prolonged within the microfracture by reaction at the silicate mineral surface to buffer pH in a solubility limiting acidic state, and to replenish dissolved silica. During this time, uranyl was additionally removed to the fracture space by diffusion from pore space. Uranyl is effectively immobilized within the microfracture environment within the presently unsaturated vadose zone.","","","Pacific Northwest National Lab. (PNNL), Richland, WA (United States).

Two processes for particle failure are accounted for: failure of touching particles at the pressing stage in the pebble manufacturing process, and failure due to inner pressure buildup during irradiation. The second process gains importance with increasing fuel temperature, which limits the particle packing density and the corresponding fuel enrichment.

Preliminary testing reveals that these materials have high affinity for certain radionuclides of environmental concern. Significant amounts of radioactive waste have built up over the last half century as the result of nuclear weapons production and the accumulation of spent nuclear fuel. Ultimately, after processing, this waste is targeted to be buried in a deep geological repository. One plan is to include ''getter materials'' in with this waste in order to sequester any radionuclides that might leak from the wasteforms. Of particular interest in this regard are the long-lived actinide species (e.g. Pu, Am, Np, etc.) and the anions (e.g. pertechnetate, iodide, etc.). These getter materials must be able to survive long-term exposure to elevated temperatures (&gt;150 C) and moderately high radiation fluxes. Due to their frailty towards radiolytic degradation, organic components cannot be used for either structure or function in the final getter material.","","","Pacific Northwest National Lab.

We applied nonlinear and generalized linear data analysis methods to relate microbial biomarkers (phospholipids fatty acids, PLFA) to groundwater geochemical characteristics at the Shiprock uranium mill tailings disposal site that is primarily contaminated by uranium, sulfate, and nitrate. First, predictive models were constructed using feedforward artificial neural networks (NN) to predict PLFA classes from geochemistry. To reduce the danger of overfitting, parsimonious NN architectures were selected based on pruning of hidden nodes and elimination of redundant predictor (geochemical) variables. The resulting NN models greatly outperformed the generalized linear models. Sensitivity analysis indicated that tritium, which was indicative of riverine influences, and uranium were important in predicting the distributions of the PLFA classes. In contrast, nitrate concentration and inorganic carbon were least important, and total ionic strength was of intermediate importance. Second, nonlinear principal components (NPC) were extracted from the PLFA data using a variant of the feedforward NN. The NPC grouped the samples according to similar geochemistry. PLFA indicators of Gram-negative bacteria and eukaryotes were associated with the groups of wells with lower levels of contamination. The more contaminated samples contained microbial communities that were predominated by terminally branched saturates and branched monounsaturates that are indicative of metal reducers, actinomycetes, and Gram-positive bacteria. These results indicate that the microbial community at the site is coupled to the geochemistry and knowledge of the geochemistry allows prediction of the community composition.","","","Pacific Northwest National Lab.

At the Hanford Site, the Plutonium-Uranium Extraction (PUREX) chemical separation plant was operational between 1983 and 1990, during which time 129I concentrations in air and milk were measured. After the cessation of operations in 1990, plant emissions decreased 2.5 orders of magnitude over an 8 year period, and monitoring of environmental levels continued. An evaluation of air and milk 129I concentration data spanning the PUREX operation and post closure period was conducted to compare the changes in environmental levels of 129I measured. Measured concentrations over the monitoring period were below levels that could result in a potential human dose greater than 10 uSv. There was a significant and measurable difference in the measured air concentrations of 129I at different distances from the source, indicating a distinct Hanford fingerprint. Correlations between stack emissions of 129I and concentrations in air and milk indicate that atmospheric emissions were responsible for the 129I concentrations measured in environmental samples. The measured concentrations during PUREX operation were similar to observations made around a fuel reprocessing plant in Germany.","","","Pacific Northwest National Lab.

For nuclear materials applications, we detected and profiled metals in coatings that were used to encapsulate nuclear fuel. Multivariate analysis has been successfully employed in the quantification of elements present in treated wood and engineered wood composites. These examples demonstrate that LIBS-based techniques are inherently well suited for diverse environmental applications related to homeland security. Three key advantages are evident: (1) small samples (mg) are sufficient; (2) samples can be analyzed by LIBS very rapidly, and (3) biological materials such as human and animal bones and wood can be analyzed with minimal sample preparation. For forensic applications they have used LIBS to determine differences in animal and human bones.

"Optical Characterization of Tristructural Isotropic Fuel Particle Cross-Sections Using Generalized Ellipsometry","Jellison, Jr, Gerald Earle; Hunn, John D; Lowden, Richard Andrew","11 NUCLEAR FUEL CYCLE AND FUEL MATERIALS; ACCURACY; ANISOTROPY; COATINGS; CROSS SECTIONS; ELLIPSOMETERS; ELLIPSOMETRY; FUEL PARTICLES; GRAIN ORIENTATION; GRAPHITE; IRRADIATION; NUCLEAR FUELS; PYROLYTIC CARBON; SPATIAL RESOLUTION","One particularly important measure of quality of tristructural isotropic (TRISO) fuel particles is the degree of preferred orientation of crystallites in the polycrystalline pyrolytic carbon coatings. Excessive crystallographic anisotropy leads to unwanted anisotropic dimensional changes during irradiation that can cause the TRISO coatings to fail. Early optical methods were developed in the 60s and 70s to measure this anisotropy by taking advantage of the large optical anisotropy of graphite. Since that time, there have been significant improvements in both the theoretical understanding and experimental techniques in the understanding of optical anisotropy. Here we discuss a new method, based on the two-modulator generalized ellipsometer (2-MGE) to measure the optical anisotropy. This technique has been demonstrated to measure the optical diattenuation to an accuracy from {+-}0.001 to {+-}0.005 and the preferred direction of the crystallites to an accuracy of better than {+-}2{sup o} with a spatial resolution of better than 5 {micro}m. Diattenuation ''pictures'' of the nuclear fuel cross-sections reveal that the inner pyrocarbon layer (IPyC) is far from uniform both in the degree of diattenuation and in the direction of the principal axis. The 2-MGE technique is faster, more accurate, and collects considerably more data than previous optical anisotropy measurements of TRISO fuel particles.","","","Oak Ridge National Lab.

"Impact of Highly Basic Solutions on Sorption of Cs+ to Subsurface Sediments from the Hanford Site, USA","Ainsworth, Calvin C; Zachara, John M; Wagnon, Ken B; McKinley, Susan G; Liu, Chongxuan; Smith, Steven C; Schaef, Herbert T; Gassman, Paul L","11 NUCLEAR FUEL CYCLE AND FUEL MATERIALS; HANFORD RESERVATION; CESIUM 137; SORPTION; DISSOLUTION; ENTHALPY; ION EXCHANGE; MICA; SEDIMENTS; ZEOLITES; PH VALUE; TIME DEPENDENCE; TEMPERATURE DEPENDENCE; cesium; ion exchange","The effect of caustic NaNO3 solutions on the sorption of 137Cs to the Hanford site micaceous subsurface sediment was investigated as a function of time, temperature (10 C or 50 C), and NaOH concentration. At 100C and 0.1 M NaOH, the slow evolution of [Al]aq was in stack contrast to the rapid increase and subsequent loss of [Al]aq observed at 50 C (regardless of base concentration). At 50 C, dissolution of phyllosilicate minerals increased with [OH], at 1 and 3 M NaOH solutions, almost complete dissolution of clay-sized phyllosilicates occurred. At 0.1 M NaOH, a zeolite (tetranatrolite) precipitated after about 7 days, while an unnamed mineral phase (Na2Al2Si3O10?2H2O) precipitated after 4 and 2 days of exposure to 1 M and 3 M NaOH solutions. At 100C there was no conclusive evidence of secondary mineral precipitation. The effect of base dissolution on Cs+ sorption by the Hanford sediment was investigated via (1) Cs+ sorption over a large concentration range (10-9 ? 10-2 mol/L) to sediment after exposure to 0.1 M NaOH for 56, 112, and 168 days, (2) Cs+ sorption to sediment in the presence of NaOH (0.1 M, 1 M, and 3 M NaOH) at Cs+ concentrations selected to probe high affinity, transition, and low affinity cation exchange sites, and (3) the application of a two-site numeric ion exchange model (Zachara et al. 2002a). No effect on Cs+ sorption to the Hanford sediment was observed during the 168 days sediment was exposed to 0.1 M NaOH, at 10 C; Cs+ sorption in the presence of base was well described by the ion exchange model when enthalpy effects were considered. In contrast, at 50 C, there was a trend toward slightly lower (log {approx} 0.25) conditional equilibrium exchange constants over the entire range of surface coverage, and a slight loss of high affinity sites (15%) after 168 days of exposure to 0.1 M base solution. However, model simulations of Cs+ sorption to the sediment in the presence of 0.1 M base for 112 days were good at the lower Cs+ surface densities. At the higher surface densities, model simulations under predicted sorption by 57%. This under prediction was surmised to be the result of tetranatrolite precipitation, and subsequent slow Na ? Cs exchange. At higher OH concentrations, Cs+ sorption in the presence of base for 112 days was unexpectedly equal to, or slightly greater than that expected for a pristine sediment. The presence of neoforms, coupled with the fairly unique mica distribution and quantity across all size-fractions in the Hanford sediment, appears to mitigate the impact of base dissolution on Cs+ sorption.","","","Pacific Northwest National Lab.

"Identifying the Potential Loss of Monitoring Wells Using an Uncertainty Analysis","Freedman, Vicky L; Waichler, Scott R; Cole, Charles R; Vermeul, Vince R; Bergeron, Marcel P","11 NUCLEAR FUEL CYCLE AND FUEL MATERIALS; HYDRAULIC CONDUCTIVITY; MONITORING; MONITORS; PLUMES; WATER TABLES; WATER WELLS; HANFORD RESERVATION; FLOW MODELS; environmental molecular sciences laboratory; groundwater, uncertainty analysis, monitoring wells, modeling","From the mid-1940s through the 1980s, large volumes of wastewater were discharged at the Hanford Site in southeastern Washington State, causing a large-scale rise (in excess of 20 m) in the water table. When wastewater discharges ceased in 1988, groundwater mounds began to dissipate. This caused a large number of wells to go dry and has made it difficult to monitor contaminant plume migration. To identify the wells that could potentially go dry, a first order uncertainty analysis was performed using a three-dimensional, finite element code (CFEST) coupled with UCODE, a nonlinear parameter estimation code. The analysis was conducted in four steps. First, key parameter values were identified by calibrating to historical hydraulic head data. Second, the model was tested for linearity, a strict requirement for representing output uncertainty. Third, results from the calibration period were used to verify model predictions by comparing monitoring wells? wet/dry status with field data. In the final step, predictions on the number and locations of dry wells were made through the year 2048. A non-physically based model that extrapolated trends at each individual well was also tested as a predictor of a well?s wet/dry status. Results demonstrated that when uncertainty in both parameter estimates and measurement error was considered, the CFEST-based model successfully predicted the majority of dry wells, outperforming the trend model. Predictions made through the year 2048 identified approximately 50% of the wells in the monitoring well network are likely to go dry, which can aid in decisions for their replacement.","","","Pacific Northwest National Lab.

S. Department of Energy Hanford site. U(VI) adsorption to sediment, treated sediment, and sediment size fractions was studied in solutions that both had and had not been preequilibrated with calcite, at initial [U(VI)] - 10-7-10-5 mol/L and final pH - 6.0-10.0. Kinetic and reversibility studies (pH 8.4) showed rapid sorption (30 min), with reasonable reversibility in the 3-day reaction time. Sorption from solutions equilibrated with calcite showed maximum U(VI) adsorption at pH 8.4-0.1. In contrast, calcium-free systems showed the greatest adsorption at pH 6.0-7.2. At pH &gt; 8.4, U(VI) adsorption was identical from calcium-free and calcium-containing solutions. For calcite-presaturated systems, both speciation calculations and laser-induced fluorescence spectroscopic analyses indicated that aqueous U(VI) was increasingly dominated by Ca2UO2(CO3)3 0(aq) at pH&lt;8.4 and that formation of Ca2UO2(CO3)3 0(aq) is what suppresses U(VI) adsorption. Above pH 8.4, aqueous U(VI) speciation was dominated by UO2(CO3)3 4- in all solutions. Finally, results also showed that U(VI) adsorption was additive in regard to size fraction but not in regard to mineral mass: Carbonate minerals may have blocked U(VI) access to surfaces of higher sorption affinity.","","","Pacific Northwest National Lab.

On tuff and synthetic pyrolusite (Mn{sup IV}O{sub 2}), Pu(IV) or Pu(V) was initially oxidized, but over time Pu(IV) became the predominant oxidation state of sorbed Pu. Reduction of Pu(V/VI), even on non-oxidizing surfaces, is proposed to result from a lower Gibbs free energy of the hydrolyzed Pu(IV) surface species versus that of the Pu(V) or Pu(VI) surface species. This work suggests that despite initial oxidation of sorbed Pu by oxidizing surfaces to more soluble forms, the less mobile form of Pu, Pu(IV), will dominate Pu solid phase speciation during long term geologic storage. The safe design of a radioactive waste or spent nuclear fuel geologic repository requires a risk assessment of radionuclides that may potentially be released into the surrounding environment. Geochemical knowledge of the radionuclide and the surrounding environment is required for predicting subsurface fate and transport. Although difficult even in simple systems, this task grows increasingly complicated for constituents, like Pu, that exhibit complex environmental chemistries. The environmental behavior of Pu can be influenced by complexation, precipitation, adsorption, colloid formation, and oxidation/reduction (redox) reactions (1-3). To predict the environmental mobility of Pu, the most important of these factors is Pu oxidation state. This is because Pu(IV) is generally 2 to 3 orders of magnitude less mobile than Pu(V) in most environments (4). Further complicating matters, Pu commonly exists simultaneously in several oxidation states (5, 6). Choppin (7) reported Pu may exist as Pu(IV), Pu(V), or Pu(VI) oxic natural groundwaters. It is generally accepted that plutonium associated with suspended particulate matter is predominantly Pu(IV) (8-10), whereas Pu in the aqueous phase is predominantly Pu(V) (2, 11-13). The influence of the character of Mn-containing minerals expected to be found in subsurface repository environments on Pu oxidation state distributions has been the subject of much recent research. Kenney-Kennicutt and Morse (14), Duff et al. (15), and Morgenstern and Choppin (16) observed oxidation of Pu facilitated by Mn(IV)-bearing minerals. Conversely, Shaughnessy et al. (17) used X-ray Absorption near-edge spectroscopy (XANES) to show reduction of Pu(VI) by hausmannite (Mn{sup II}Mn{sub 2}{sup III}O{sub 4}) and manganite ({gamma}-Mn{sup III}OOH) and Kersting et al., (18) observed reduction of Pu(VI) by pyrolusite (Mn{sup IV}O{sub 2}). In this paper, we attempt to reconcile the apparently conflicting datasets by showing that Mn-bearing minerals can indeed oxidize Pu, however, if the oxidized species remains on the solid phase, the oxidation step competes with the formation of Pu(IV) that becomes the predominant solid phase Pu species with time. The experimental approach we took was to conduct longer term (approximately two years later) oxidation state analyses on the Pu sorbed to Yucca Mountain tuff (initial analysis reported by Duff et al., (15)) and measure the time-dependant changes in the oxidation state distribution of Pu in the presence of the Mn mineral pyrolusite.","pubinfo","available","Savannah River Site (SRS), Aiken, SC (United States)","USDOE","","United States","2005-09-13T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","","","Medium: ED","","WSRC-MS-2005-00519","DE-AC09-96SR18500","TRN: US0604710","","","2009-12-16T00:00:00Z","890082","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/890082","https://www.osti.gov/servlets/purl/890082","","",""

The continuum is most likely a Compton reflection (reprocessing) of primary emission that is completely absorbed at least up to 7 keV. The lines can be identified with fluorescence from Si, S and Fe in the lowest ionization stages. The equivalent widths of the Si and S lines are broadly compatible with those anticipated for reprocessing by optically thick cold plasma of Solar abundances, while the large equivalent width of the Fe line requires some overabundance of iron. A contribution to the line from a transmitted component cannot be ruled out, but the limits on the strength of the Compton shoulder make it less likely. From the bolometric luminosity of the nuclear region, we infer that the source radiates at 1-10% of its Eddington luminosity, for an adopted central mass of 3 x 10{sup 6} M{sub {circle_dot}}. The overall spectrum is consistent with the hypotheses that the central engines powering the detected megamsers in accretion disks are obscured from direct view by the associated accretion disk material itself, and that there is a correlation between the occurrence of megamaser emission and Compton-thick absorption columns. For the 11 known galaxies with both column density measurements and maser emission believed to arise from accretion disks, eight AGN are Compton thick.","","http://www.slac.stanford.edu/cgi-wrap/pubpage?slac-pub-11469.html","SLAC National Accelerator Lab., Menlo Park, CA (United States)","USDOE","","United States","2005-09-12T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: Astrophysical Journal; Journal Volume: 636","","Medium: ED","","SLAC-PUB-11469","AC02-76SF00515","Journal ID: ISSN 0004-637X; ASJOAB; astro-ph/0510013; TRN: US0602369","","","2009-12-16T00:00:00Z","878419","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/878419","https://www.osti.gov/servlets/purl/878419","Astrophysical Journal","","636"

Dissolution of crystalline uranium (IV) dioxide under environmental conditions has been studied for four decades but a cardinal gap in the published literature is the effect of pH and solution saturation state on UO2(cr) dissolution. To resolve these inconsistencies, UO2 dissolution experiments have been conducted under oxic conditions using the single-pass flow-through system. Experiments were conducted as a function of total dissolved carbonate ([CO3-2]T) from 0.001 to 0.1 M; pH from 7.5 to 11.1; ratio of flow-through rate (q) to specific surface area (S), constant ionic strength (I) = 0.1 M, and temperatures (T) from 23 to 60 C utilizing both powder and monolithic specimens. The results show that UO2 dissolution varies as a function of the ratio q/S and temperature. At values of log10 q/S &gt; -7.0, UO2 dissolution becomes invariant with respect to q/S, which can be interpreted as evidence for dissolution at the forward rate of reaction. The data collected in these experiments show the rate of UO2 dissolution increased by an order of magnitude with a 30? increase in temperature. The results also show the overall dissolution rate will increase with an increase in pH and decrease as the dissolved uranium concentration approaches saturation with respect to secondary reaction products. Thus, as the value of the reaction quotient, Q, approaches equilibrium, K, (with respect to a potential secondary phase) the dissolution rate decreases. This decrease in dissolution rate was also observed when comparing measured UO2 dissolution rates from static tests where r = 1.7 ?0.14 ? 10-8 mol m 2 s-1 to the rate for flow-through reactors where r = 3.1 ?1.2 ? 10-7 mol m-2 s-1. Thus, using traditional static test methods can result in an underestimation of the true forward rate of UO2(cr) dissolution. These results illustrate the release of uranium from UO2 in the natural environment will be controlled by pH, solution saturation state, and the concentration of dissolved carbonate.","","","Pacific Northwest National Lab.

This type of reactor will be able to open new frontiers of research for Generation IV reactors, the Space Propulsion Program, and the Advanced Fuel Cycle Initiative. With the confluence of these three programs&#39; fast-spectrum testing needs, we set out to conceptualize a new system by looking at previous successful reactor concepts. This paper presents a new concept for a fast-spectrum test reactor that is horizontal in orientation, with individual pressure tubes running the entire length of the scattering-medium tank filled with a liquid heavy metal. This approach for a test reactor will provide more flexibility in refueling, sample removal, and ability to completely reconfigure the core to meet different users&#39; requirements. Full core neutronic analysis of more than 14 combinations showed that a large hexagonal steam-cooled U-10Zr fuel, with a core power of 267 MW(thermal), produced a fast flux (>0.1 MeV) of 1.3 × 1015 n/cm2s averaged over the whole length of the irradiation channel. A depletion run with an initial enrichment of 20 wt% 235U had a flat reactivity curve for the first 180 days of cycle due to in-core breeding. Although considerable neutronic optimization and a thermal-hydraulic analysis remain to be performed, it appears that a reactor core with this innovative geometry could meet future fast flux testing needs.","","","Idaho National Lab.

This forensic information is important to determine the origin of unknown nuclear waste. The distribution of isotopes in waste products provides information about a nuclear fuel cycle, even when the isotopes of uranium and plutonium are removed through chemical processing. Several different reactor cycles of the PWR, BWR, CANDU, and LMFBR were simulated for this work with the ORIGEN-ARP and ORIGEN 2.2 codes. The spent fuel nuclide concentrations of these reactors were analyzed to find the most informative isotopic ratios indicative of irradiation cycle length and reactor design. Special focus was given to long-lived and stable fission products that would be present many years after their creation. For such nuclides, mass spectrometry analysis methods often have better detection limits than classic gamma-ray spectroscopy. The isotopic ratios {sup 151}Sm/{sup 146}Sm, {sup 149}Sm/{sup 146}Sm, and {sup 244}Cm/{sup 246}Cm were found to be good indicators of fuel cycle length and are well suited for analysis by accelerator mass spectroscopy.","","","Lawrence Livermore National Lab.

Shallow soils and groundwater beneath the TNX facility are contaminated with chlorinated volatile organic compounds (CVOCs), trichloroethylene (TCE), carbon tetrachloride (CCl{sub 4}), perchloroethylene (PCE), and chloroform (CHCl{sub 3}). An interim pump and treat remediation system was placed in operation in 1996 to provide hydraulic containment of groundwater containing greater than 500 ug/L dissolved TCE. In 1994, a vadose zone study was initiated to determine the degree and extent of CVOC contamination above the contaminated groundwater. Headspace sampling and analysis, acoustic infrared spectroscopy, cone penetrometry, and vadose zone pumping tests were used to determine contaminant concentrations and physical properties related to soil vapor extraction. In 2001, soil vapor extraction (SVE), a presumptive remedy for CVOCs in soils similar to those present beneath TNX, was selected to treat the CVOC contamination. Cone Penetrometer Testing (CPT) with soil vapor sampling provided a detailed understanding of the subsurface geology and CVOC distribution which was essential for proper well design and placement. Twelve SVE wells were installed using direct push technology (DPT) and were tested to determine specific capacity and CVOC concentrations. This information was then used to develop a strategy for operating the SVE system. Based on the results of the baseline testing and previous studies, sets of 2 to 3 extraction wells will be treated using SVE at one month intervals. This will allow continuous operation of the SVE system and give individual wells up to 3 months for rebound between treatments. This method of operation is intended to maximize contaminant recovery from individual wells and reduce the overall capital investment and operating cost of the SVE system.","","","Savannah River Site (SRS), Aiken, SC","USDOE","","United States","2005-08-02T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","","","Medium: ED","","WSRC-MS-2005-00048","DE-AC09-96SR18500","TRN: US0603079","10.1306/eg.06070504052","","2016-05-09T00:00:00Z","881347","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/881347","https://www.osti.gov/servlets/purl/881347","","",""

The primary concern has been the potential health effects resulting from exposure to residual radioactive materials to be released for unrestricted use. These debates have intensified in the last decade as many regulated facilities are seeking viable management decisions on the disposition of the large amounts of materials potentially containing very low levels of residual radioactivity. Such facilities include the nuclear weapons complex sites managed by the U.S. Department of Energy (DOE), commercial power plants licensed by the U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission (NRC), and other materials licensees regulated by the NRC or the Agreement States. Other facilities that generate radioactive material containing naturally occurring radioactive materials (NORM) or technologically enhanced NORM (TENORM) are also seeking to dispose of similar materials that may be radioactively contaminated. In contrast to the facilities operated by the DOE and the nuclear power plants licensed by the NRC, NORM and TENORM facilities are regulated by the individual states. Current federal laws and regulations do not specify criteria for releasing these materials that may contain residual radioactivity of either man-made or natural origin from regulatory controls. In fact, the current regulatory scheme offers no explicit provision as to permit materials being released as ''non-radioactive'', including those that are essentially free of contamination. The only method used to date with limited success has been case-by-case evaluation and approval. In addition, there is a poorly defined and inconsistent regulatory framework for regulating NORM and TENORM. Some years ago, the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) introduced the concept of clearance, that is, controlling releases of any such materials within the regulatory domain. This paper aims to clarify clearance as an important disposition option for solid materials, establish the framework and basis of release, and discuss resolutions regarding the implementation of such a disposition option.","","","Pacific Northwest National Lab.

The radiological hazard potential associated with polonium can be significantly reduced by continuous online removal of polonium from the coolant. The removal method under investigation in this research is alkaline extraction. Chemical kinetic measurements were made to determine first and second order rate constants, activation energy, and heat of reaction at various temperatures using tellurium as a surrogate. First and second order alkaline extraction rate constants were measured to be: k1 = 10.05 e –52,274/RT and k2 = 167 e –97,224/RT. Alkaline extraction is dependent on temperature and was found to follow the Arrhenius rate law. The activation energy (Ea) ranged between 52,274 – 97,224 J mol-1.

The uranium price at which reprocessing spent fuel from light water reactors (LWRs) and recycling the resulting plutonium and uranium in LWRs would become economic is estimated for a range of reprocessing prices and other fuel cycle costs. The contribution of both fuel cycle options to the cost of electricity is also estimated. A similar analysis is performed to compare fast neutron reactors (FRs) with LWRs. We review available information about various fuel cycle costs, as well as the quantities of uranium likely to be recoverable at a range of future prices. We conclude that the once-through LWR fuel cycle is likely to remain significantly cheaper than recycling in either LWRs or FRs for at least the next 50 yr, even with substantial growth in nuclear power.","","","","","","United States","2005-06-15T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: Nuclear Technology; Journal Volume: 150; Journal Issue: 3; Other Information: Copyright (c) 2006 American Nuclear Society (ANS), United States, All rights reserved. http://epubs.ans.org/; Country of input: International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA)","","Medium: X; Size: page(s) 209-230","","","","Journal ID: ISSN 0029-5450; NUTYBB; TRN: US06N1039013526","","","2010-06-03T00:00:00Z","20840269","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/20840269","","Nuclear Technology","3","150"

Most OCRWM program resources are devoted to these important objectives, to be accomplished over a long time frame. OCRWM has also begun a separate science and technology initiative to develop technological improvements and system enhancements to its baseline practices. Our overview of the technical content of this Science and Technology Program summarizes its rationale, beginnings, areas of current investigation, and near-term plans. In 2002, following a national decision-making process specified in the 1982 Nuclear Waste Policy Act, Yucca Mountain was formally designated as the site for the nation's geologic repository for commercial spent fuel and HLW generated from defense programs. By transporting spent fuel and HLW safely to Yucca Mountain for emplacement underground, OCRWM will fulfill its mission ''to manage and dispose of high-level radioactive waste and spent nuclear fuel in a manner that protects health, safety, and the environment; enhances national and energy security; and merits public confidence''. The activities involved in accepting, transporting, handling, and disposing of spent fuel and other HLW are planned to span decades, if not centuries, and hence many components of the waste management system (e.g., spent fuel handling facilities and the Yucca Mountain repository itself) are designed for long-term operations. Current plans adequately address all system requirements using present-day technology, but relevant technical advances (in both scientific knowledge and engineering practice) will continue over time.","","","Lawrence Livermore National Lab.

Solids were characterized by X-ray powder diffraction (XRD), gamma spectrometry (GS), scanning electron microscopy (SEM) with energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDS), and transmission electron microscopy (TEM) with electron energy-loss spectroscopy (EELS). Neptunium concentration was determined in the bulk solid phases by GS and was found to range from 780 – 15,800 μg/g.

Revelations regarding the expansiveness of the A.Q. Khan network provided a clear impetus for the Resolution. Resolution 1540 is distinctive because it is the first time the U.N. Security Council has required all Member States to act to prevent the illicit trafficking of CBRN materials and their means of delivery. It is also unique in that it specifically addresses prevention of CBRN proliferation and trafficking among non-state actors. The Resolution has a direct impact on the management of nuclear materials and nonproliferation policy in the future. Consequently, the INMM Nonproliferation and Arms Control Technical Division and the INMM Northeast Chapter initiated a professional workshop on March 15, 2005 to engage topical experts in a discussion of U.N.

At gas mix pressures below 100 millitorr, laser-assisted condensation repression on cold walls can induce isotope separations for some vapors at certain cryogenic temperatures. For example, for {sup i}SF{sub 6}/N{sub 2} mixtures, narrow temperature 'windows' are found in the 70 to 90 K region where enrichments exceed {beta}{sub i} = {beta}{sub 33} = 1.7. For {sup i}UF{sub 6}/G gas mixes, enrichment under full condensation conditions is not possible since the surface potential well ({approx}1150 cm{sup -1}) of a UF{sub 6} condensate layer is higher than the vibration-to-translation conversion quantum of the v{sub 3} vibration ({approx}628 cm{sup -1}). However, for UF{sub 6}{sup *} adsorptions on a bare surface of F{sub 2}-passivated gold with well depth of 400 cm{sup -1} or less, initial isotope enrichments with {beta} {approx} 1.1 are possible before the surface is covered with UF{sub 6} condensate. Throughputs in cold-wall isotope separations are low because of low operating pressures. For enrichments of milligrams of a radioactive isotope in nuclear medicine, this is still useful and offers a low-footprint alternative to calutron or ultracentrifuge separations. Since feed and product streams are the same, the method lends itself to multistaging, with one laser irradiating four or more chambers in series.","","","","","","United States","2005-05-15T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: Nuclear Science and Engineering; Journal Volume: 150; Journal Issue: 1; Other Information: Copyright (c) 2006 American Nuclear Society (ANS), United States, All rights reserved. http://epubs.ans.org/; Country of input: International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA)","","Medium: X; Size: page(s) 1-26","","","","Journal ID: ISSN 0029-5639; NSENAO; TRN: US06N0403109923","","","2010-06-03T00:00:00Z","20808431","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/20808431","","Nuclear Science and Engineering","1","150"

For a closed fuel cycle, the leasing fuel cycle shows potential to reduce proliferation concern, especially if coupled with improved security and safeguard technology.","","","","","","United States","2005-05-15T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: Nuclear Technology; Journal Volume: 150; Journal Issue: 2; Other Information: Copyright (c) 2006 American Nuclear Society (ANS), United States, All rights reserved. http://epubs.ans.org/; Country of input: International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA)","","Medium: X; Size: page(s) 121-131","","","","Journal ID: ISSN 0029-5450; NUTYBB; TRN: US06N1031013518","","","2010-06-03T00:00:00Z","20840261","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/20840261","","Nuclear Technology","2","150"

This paper describes a radiochemical sensing method for selective detection of 99Tc(VII) in water. The sensing approach uses dual-function composite sensor microcolumn that incorporates both selective sorption and scintillating properties. Analyte detection is carried out in a reagentless equilibration sensing regime using chemically unmodified groundwater. The sensor method was implemented in a prototypical probe device that integrates the sensor element, scintillation detection, data acquisition, and instrument control components in a single functional instrument compatible with a 3.5-inch well casing geometry. The feasibility of rapid 99Tc analysis in Hanford groundwater (Hanford Site, USA) below regulatory drinking water level of 33 Bq/L was demonstrated.","","","Pacific Northwest National Lab.

The emergence of sophisticated terrorist networks, black markets in nuclear technology, and technological leaps associated with globalization have conspired to threaten one of the most successful examples of international cooperation in history. The rampant proliferation of nuclear weapons that was predicted at the start of the nuclear age has been largely held in check and the use of those weapons avoided. Nonetheless, with the thirty-fifth anniversary of the Treaty on the Nonproliferation of Nuclear Weapons (NPT), the threat of nuclear proliferation seems more serious than ever. Although experts readily concede that there exist many pathways to proliferation, the threat posed by the misuse of the civilian nuclear fuel cycle has received considerable recent attention. While the connection between nuclear energy and nonproliferation has been a topic of discussion since the dawn of the nuclear age, world events have brought the issue to the forefront once again. United States President George W. Bush and International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) Director General Mohammad ElBaradei are among those who have highlighted proliferation risks associated with civilian nuclear power programs and called for revitalizing the nuclear nonproliferation regime to address new threats. From the possibility of diversion or theft of nuclear material or technology, to the use of national civilian programs as a cover for weapons programs - what some have called latent proliferation - the fuel cycle appears to many to represent a glaring proliferation vulnerability. Just as recognition of these risks is not new, neither is recognition of the many positive benefits of nuclear energy. In fact, a renewed interest in exploiting these benefits has increased the urgency of addressing the risks. Global energy demand is expected to at least double by the middle of the century and could increase even more quickly. Much of the new demand will come from the rapidly expanding economies in China and India, but much of the developing world stands poised to follow the same path. This growth in demand is paralleled by concerns about global warming and the long-term reliability of carbon-based fuel supplies, concerns which expanded use of nuclear power can help to address. For these reasons and others, many countries in Asia have already clearly signaled that nuclear energy will play a key role for years to come. Numerous proposals have been made in the last two years for reducing the proliferation risk of the civilian nuclear fuel cycle. These range from a ban on export of enrichment and reprocessing technology to countries not already possessing operational capabilities to multinational management of the nuclear fuel cycle and strengthening existing monitoring and security mechanisms. The need for international willingness to enforce nonproliferation commitments and norms has also been emphasized. Some of these proposals could significantly impact the production of nuclear energy. Because the successful strengthening of the nonproliferation regime and the expansion of nuclear energy are so closely related, any successful approach to resolving these issues will require the creative input of experts from both the nuclear energy and nonproliferation communities. Against this backdrop, Sandia National Laboratories organized its 14th International Security Conference (ISC) around the theme: Strengthening the Nuclear Nonproliferation Regime: Focus on the Civilian Nuclear Fuel Cycle. The goal of the conference was to begin a constructive dialogue between the nuclear energy and nuclear nonproliferation communities. The conference was held in Chantilly, Virginia, just outside Washington, D.C. on April 4-6, 2005, and was attended by approximately 125 participants from fifteen countries. The ISC agenda was structured to produce a systematic review of the connection between civilian nuclear energy programs and the proliferation of nuclear weapons and to identify constructive approaches to strengthen the nonproliferation regime. The conference began by reviewing the energy and security context that has, once again, raised the profile of this issue. A discussion of the risks associated with the civilian nuclear fuel cycle was then used to inform the analysis of several potential risk-management tools. The conference concluded by looking for lessons from the past as well as looking forward to future opportunities, with a particular focus on East Asia. In this paper we summarize the debates and ideas that emerged during the conference. Although we have drawn on material presented by speakers and comments made by participants, we do not quote or cite the specific contributions of individuals.","","","Sandia National Laboratories (SNL), Albuquerque, NM, and Livermore, CA (United States)","USDOE","","United States","2005-04-01T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: Proposed for publication in the INMM Journal.","","Medium: X; Size: 15 p.","","SAND2005-2577J","AC04-94AL85000","TRN: US1001264","","","2010-03-08T00:00:00Z","971818","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/971818","","Proposed for publication in the INMM Journal.","",""

Lowering the sample temperature from RT to {approx} 5.5 K significantly enhanced the fluorescence intensity and spectral resolution of both the minerals and sediments, offering improved possibilities for identifying uranyl species in environmental samples. At 5.5 K, all of the uranyl silicates showed unique, well-resolved fluorescence spectra. The symmetric O=U=O stretching frequency, as determined from the peak spacing of the vibronic bands in the emission spectra, were between 705 to 823 cm-1 for the uranyl silicates. These were lower than those reported for uranyl phosphate, carbonate, or oxy-hydroxides. The fluorescence emission spectra of all four sediment samples were similar to each other. Their spectra shifted minimally at different time delays or upon contact with basic Na/Ca-carbonate electrolyte solutions that dissolved up to 60 % of the precipitated U(VI) pool. The well-resolved vibronic peaks in the fluorescence spectra of the sediments indicated that the major fluorescence species was a crystalline uranyl mineral phase, while the peak spacing of the vibronic bands pointed to the likely presence of uranyl silicate. Although, an exact match was not found between the U(VI) fluorescence spectra of the sediments with that of any individual uranyl silicates, the major spectral characteristics indicated that the sediment U(VI) was a uranophane-type solid (uranophane, boltwoodite) or soddyite, as was concluded from microprobe, EXAFS, and solubility analyses.","","","Pacific Northwest National Lab.

"HEU Measurements of Holdup and Recovered Residue in the Deactivation and Decommissioning Activities of the 321-M Reactor Fuel Fabrication Facility at the Savannah River Site","DEWBERRY, RAYMOND; SALAYMEH, SALEEM R; CASELLA, VITO R; MOORE, FRANK S","11 NUCLEAR FUEL CYCLE AND FUEL MATERIALS; CONTAINERS; CYCLONE SEPARATORS; DEACTIVATION; DECOMMISSIONING; DECONTAMINATION; EXHAUST SYSTEMS; FABRICATION; FUEL ASSEMBLIES; HIGHLY ENRICHED URANIUM; NEPTUNIUM; NUCLEAR FUELS; PRODUCTION REACTORS; RESIDUES; SOLID WASTES","This paper contains a summary of the holdup and material control and accountability (MC&amp;A) assays conducted for the determination of highly enriched uranium (HEU) in the deactivation and decommissioning (D&amp;D) of Building 321-M at the Savannah River Site (SRS). The 321-M facility was the Reactor Fuel Fabrication Facility at SRS and was used to fabricate HEU fuel assemblies, lithium-aluminum target tubes, neptunium assemblies, and miscellaneous components for the SRS production reactors. The facility operated for more than 35 years. During this time thousands of uranium-aluminum-alloy (U-Al) production reactor fuel tubes were produced. After the facility ceased operations in 1995, all of the easily accessible U-Al was removed from the building, and only residual amounts remained. The bulk of this residue was located in the equipment that generated and handled small U-Al particles and in the exhaust systems for this equipment (e.g., Chip compactor, casting furnaces, log saw, lathes A & B, cyclone separator, Freon{trademark} cart, riser crusher, ...etc). The D&amp;D project is likely to represent an important example for D&amp;D activities across SRS and across the Department of Energy weapons complex. The Savannah River National Laboratory was tasked to conduct holdup assays to quantify the amount of HEU on all components removed from the facility prior to placing in solid waste containers. The U-235 holdup in any single component of process equipment must not exceed 50 g in order to meet the container limit. This limit was imposed to meet criticality requirements of the low level solid waste storage vaults. Thus the holdup measurements were used as guidance to determine if further decontamination of equipment was needed to ensure that the quantity of U-235 did not exceed the 50 g limit and to ensure that the waste met the Waste Acceptance Criteria (WAC) of the solid waste storage vaults. Since HEU is an accountable nuclear material, the holdup assays and assays of recovered residue were also important for material control and accountability purposes. In summary, the results of the holdup assays were essential for determining compliance with the Waste Acceptance Criteria, Material Control & Accountability, and to ensure that administrative criticality safety controls were not exceeded. This paper discusses the {gamma}-ray assay measurements conducted and the modeling of the acquired data to obtain measured holdup in process equipment, exhaust components, and fixed geometry scrap cans. It also presents development work required to model new acquisition configurations and to adapt available instrumentation to perform the assays.","","","Savannah River Site (SRS), Aiken, SC","USDOE","","United States","2005-03-11T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","","","Medium: ED","","WSRC-MS-2004-00792","DE-AC09-96SR18500","TRN: US0603135","","","2009-12-16T00:00:00Z","881345","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/881345","https://www.osti.gov/servlets/purl/881345","","",""

With lactate present, G20 reduced U(VI) in both 1,4-piperazinediethanesulfonate (PIPES) and bicarbonate buffer. Once lactate was depleted, however, microbially reduced U served as an electron donor to reduce Fe(III) present in iron(III) (hydr)oxides. With the same initial amount of Fe(III) (10 mmol/L) for each iron(III) (hydr)oxide,reoxidation of U(IV) was greater with hematite than with goethite or ferrihydrite. As the initial mass loading of hematite increased from 0 to 20 mmol of Fe(III)/L, the rate and extent of U(IV) reoxidation increased. Subsequent addition of hematite [15 mmol of Fe(III)/L] to stationary-phase cultures containing microbially reduced U(IV) also resulted in rapid reoxidation to U(VI). Analysis by U L3-edge X-ray absorption near-edge spectroscopy (XANES) of microbially reduced U particles yielded spectra similar to that of natural uraninite. Observations by high-resolution transmission electron microscopy, selected area electron diffraction, and energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopic analysis confirmed that precipitated U associated with cells was uraninite with particle diameters of 3-5 nm. By the same techniques, iron sulfide precipitates were found to have a variable Fe and S stoichiometry and were not associated with cells.","","","Pacific Northwest National Lab.

Suspensions of aggregates were observed to form at the air-water interface for each of five samples. These suspended aggregates were characterized by X-ray diffraction (XRD) to be metastudtite (UO{sub 4} {center_dot} 2H{sub 2}O), while the corrosion present on the surface of the fuel itself was determined to be studtite [(UO{sub 2})(O{sub 2})(H{sub 2}O){sub 2}](H{sub 2}O){sub 2}. The presence of unreacted UO{sub 2} matrix was below the limits of detection by XRD for the three samples examined. The result prompted a radiochemical analysis of the solids collected from the sample air-water interface. The analysis indicated that high concentrations of {sup 90}Sr, {sup 137}Cs, and {sup 99}Tc, relative to the fuel inventory, had concentrated at the air-water interface along with the aggregates of metastudtite. Concentrations of {sup 241}Am were at least two orders of magnitude lower than expected in these solids, and retention of {sup 237}Np and {sup 239}Pu into the corrosion product was observed. The combined radiochemical analyses of the air-water interface aggregates and leachate samples are a rare example of radionuclide partitioning to an alteration phase and may provide preliminary evidence for mechanisms that give rise to such noticeable departures from fuel-inventory values. The leachate radiochemical data are compared to existing data from hydration of the same CSNF.","","","Pacific Northwest National Lab., Richland, WA (US)","US Department of Energy (US)","","United States","2005-03-01T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: Radiochimica Acta; Journal Volume: 93; Journal Issue: 3; Other Information: PBD: 1 Mar 2005","","Medium: X; Size: page(s) 169-175","","PNNL-SA-43013","AC05-76RL01830","Journal ID: ISSN 0033-8230; RAACAP; TRN: US0503164","10.1524/ract.93.3.169.61615","","2009-12-17T00:00:00Z","15016738","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/15016738","","Radiochimica Acta","3","93"

At short hydration times, crystallites of metaschoepite [(UO?)?O?(OH)??] (H?O)?? were observed on the hydrated CSNF particles. Over the 2-year contact period, all evidence of metaschoepite disappeared, and the fuel particles were coated by a new alteration phase. Additionally, films of the reacted fuel were observed at the sample air-water interface of each sample. The corrosion phases on fuel powders and on the suspended films were examined by scanning electron microscopy, energy-dispersive X-ray fluorescence, and X-ray diffraction and were identified as studtite [(UO?) (O?) (H?O)?] (H?O)? and metastudtite (UO? ?2H?O), respectively. The reason for the partitioning of the latter phase to the sample air-water interface is unclear at this time but may be due to structural differences between the two phases. Scanning electron micrographs of the CSNF powders indicated surface corrosion along grain boundaries and fragmentation of the primary solid. The occurrence of studtite and metastudtite on CSNF could have implications for the potential attenuation of released radionuclides during oxidative corrosion of CSNF in a geologic repository.","","","Pacific Northwest National Lab.

The incoming 238PuO2 contains a significant amount of impurities that must be removed before it can be processed any further. One of the purification steps involves the ion exchange process. This process sorbs the putative [Pu(NO3)6]2- dianion onto an anion exchange resin (Reillex{sup TM} HPQ), while impurities are washed from the Pu sorbed resin. Most impurities in the solution do not sorb to the resin and are part of the effluent stream. During the wash cycle, 7 M of nitric acid is pumped through the resin column to wash the resin of unsorbed impurities. The solution collected (with impurities) is the wash stream. In some cases, an online gamma spectrophotometer is used to monitor the wash stream for 234U and 241Am, and ensures that a large percentage of these isotopes have washed through the column, indicating efficient separation from the plutonium. In the final step of the process, the Pu is released (desorbed) from the resin by pumping eluant through the column during the elution cycle. Typically, the eluant used to desorb the plutonium is 0.45 M HNO3. The focus of this presentation discusses an automated elution process that has been incorporated into the system used at Los Alamos in the event that the operators must vacate the laboratory in the case of an emergency. The automated elution process is triggered by temperature, pressure, and liquid level signals being monitored on both Ion Exchange columns. The automated system relies on the commercially available Lookout{sup TM} software to control each pump and valve in the system and is programmed to perform an automatic elution for a preset time if any of the operational limiting conditions are met.","","","","","","United States","2005-02-06T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: AIP Conference Proceedings; Journal Volume: 746; Journal Issue: 1; Conference: STAIF 2005: Conference on thermophysics in microgravity; Conference on commercial/civil next generation space transportation; 22. symposium on space nuclear power and propulsion; Conference on human/robotic technology and the national vision for space exploration; 3. symposium on space colonization; 2. symposium on new frontiers and future concepts, Albuquerque, NM (United States), 13-17 Feb 2005; Other Information: DOI: 10.1063/1.1867200; (c) 2005 American Institute of Physics; Country of input: International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA)","","Medium: X; Size: page(s) 800-805","","","","Journal ID: ISSN 0094-243X; APCPCS; TRN: US05A7488073420","10.1063/1.1867200","","2012-06-28T00:00:00Z","20630589","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/20630589","","AIP Conference Proceedings","1","746"

The demand for this fuel is increasing, yet there are currently no domestic sources of this material. Much of the fuel is material reprocessed from other sources. One rich source of Pu-238 residual material is that from contaminated combustible materials, such as cheesecloth, ion exchange resins and plastics. From both waste minimization and production efficiency standpoints, the best solution is to recover this material. One way to accomplish separation of the organic component from these residues is a flameless oxidation process using molten salt as the matrix for the breakdown of the organic to carbon dioxide and water. The plutonium is retained in the salt, and can be recovered by dissolution of the carbonate salt in an aqueous solution, leaving the insoluble oxide behind. Further aqueous scrap recovery processing is used to purify the plutonium oxide. Recovery of the plutonium from contaminated combustibles achieves two important goals. First, it increases the inventory of Pu-238 available for heat source fabrication. Second, it is a significant waste minimization process. Because of its thermal activity (0.567 W per gram), combustibles must be packaged for disposition with much lower amounts of Pu-238 per drum than other waste types. Specifically, cheesecloth residues in the form of pyrolyzed ash (for stabilization) are being stored for eventual recovery of the plutonium.","","","","","","United States","2005-02-06T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: AIP Conference Proceedings; Journal Volume: 746; Journal Issue: 1; Conference: STAIF 2005: Conference on thermophysics in microgravity; Conference on commercial/civil next generation space transportation; 22. symposium on space nuclear power and propulsion; Conference on human/robotic technology and the national vision for space exploration; 3. symposium on space colonization; 2. symposium on new frontiers and future concepts, Albuquerque, NM (United States), 13-17 Feb 2005; Other Information: DOI: 10.1063/1.1867201; (c) 2005 American Institute of Physics; Country of input: International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA)","","Medium: X; Size: page(s) 806-814","","","","Journal ID: ISSN 0094-243X; APCPCS; TRN: US05A7489073421","10.1063/1.1867201","","2012-06-28T00:00:00Z","20630590","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/20630590","","AIP Conference Proceedings","1","746"
"Analysis of the Effect of Time, Temperature, and Fuel Age on Helium Release from 238-Plutonium Dioxide Fuel","Barklay, Chadwick D; Kramer, Daniel P; Ruhkamp, Joseph D","11 NUCLEAR FUEL CYCLE AND FUEL MATERIALS; ALPHA DECAY; CONTAINERS; DIFFUSION; FISSION; FUEL CANS; HELIUM; HELIUM IONS; NUCLEAR FUELS; OXYGEN COMPOUNDS; PARTIAL PRESSURE; PLUTONIUM 238; PLUTONIUM COMPOUNDS; REACTOR ACCIDENTS; SPACE VEHICLES; TIME DEPENDENCE","The compound 238-plutonium dioxide has been employed over the last several decades as the fuel of choice in fabricating nuclear powered thermal to electrical converters. The alpha decay of 238-plutonium results in the generation of helium ions as a function of time. While the quantity of helium formed within the fuel can be easily calculated, its diffusion and/or release mechanism as a function of time, temperature, fuel quantity and age needs to be characterized. Within the scope of this paper the principle interest centers on determining the expected quantity of helium that will be released from solid 238-plutonium dioxide fuel forms enclosed within a primary containment vessel (PCV) under Hypothetical Accident Conditions (HAC) as described in 10 CFR 71.73(4). Once the quantity of helium released during HAC has been determined, the partial pressure increase due to the helium release can be calculated for a given shipping configuration. This partial pressure increase due to helium release during HAC for a selected shipping configuration can then be used to determine if the structural integrity of the package will be maintained or compromised during HAC. However, it is important to recognize that helium release is not a function of a particular shipping package, but as shall be demonstrated is a function of time, temperature, and fuel quantity and age.","","","","","","United States","2005-02-06T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: AIP Conference Proceedings; Journal Volume: 746; Journal Issue: 1; Conference: STAIF 2005: Conference on thermophysics in microgravity; Conference on commercial/civil next generation space transportation; 22. symposium on space nuclear power and propulsion; Conference on human/robotic technology and the national vision for space exploration; 3. symposium on space colonization; 2. symposium on new frontiers and future concepts, Albuquerque, NM (United States), 13-17 Feb 2005; Other Information: DOI: 10.1063/1.1867203; (c) 2005 American Institute of Physics; Country of input: International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA)","","Medium: X; Size: page(s) 820-826","","","","Journal ID: ISSN 0094-243X; APCPCS; TRN: US05A7491073423","10.1063/1.1867203","","2010-06-03T00:00:00Z","20630592","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/20630592","","AIP Conference Proceedings","1","746"

These management functions include development of standardised systems for long-term disposal in the proposed Yucca Mountain repository. Nuclear criticality control measures are needed in these systems to avoid restrictive fissile loading limits because of the enrichment and total quantity of fissile material in some types of the DOE spent nuclear fuel. This need is being addressed by development of corrosion-resistant, neutron-absorbing structural alloys for nuclear criticality control. This paper outlines results of a metallurgical development programme that is investigating the alloying of gadolinium into a nickel-chromium-molybdenum alloy matrix. Gadolinium has been chosen as the neutron absorption alloying element due to its high thermal neutron absorption cross section and low solubility in the expected repository environment. The nickel-chromium-molybdenum alloy family was chosen for its known corrosion performance, mechanical properties, and weldability. The workflow of this programme includes chemical composition definition, primary and secondary melting studies, ingot conversion processes, properties testing, and national consensus codes and standards work. The microstructural investigation of these alloys shows that the gadolinium addition is present in the alloy as a gadolinium-rich second phase. The mechanical strength values are similar to those expected for commercial Ni-Cr-Mo alloys. The alloys have been corrosion tested with acceptable results. The initial results of weldability tests have also been acceptable. Neutronic testing in a moderated critical array has generated favourable results. An American Society for Testing and Materials material specification has been issued for the alloy and a Code Case has been submitted to the American Society of Mechanical Engineers for code qualification.","","","Sandia National Laboratories (SNL), Albuquerque, NM, and Livermore, CA (United States)","USDOE","","United States","2005-02-01T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: Proposed for publication in the International Journal of Packaging, Transport, Storage and Security of Radioactive Materials.; Journal Volume: 16; Journal Issue: 1","","Medium: X; Size: 9 p.","","SAND2005-0710J","AC04-94AL85000","Journal ID: ISSN 1746-5095; TRN: US1007427","","","2010-11-08T00:00:00Z","990985","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/990985","","Proposed for publication in the International Journal of Packaging, Transport, Storage and Security of Radioactive Materials.","1","16"

Very few studies have evaluated the geochemical behavior of iodine isotopes in the subsurface. The concentrations of {sup 129}I and {sup 127}I were measured in wells fed by a series of artificial recharge ponds in the Forebay Area of the Orange County groundwater basin (California, USA) to evaluate their potential use as hydrological tracers.

The anomalous aryl strengthening (AAS) effect, i.e. the anomalous increase of extraction ability of methylene bridged diphosphine dioxides due to substitution of aromatic (i.e., phenyl) for alkyl (e.g., butyl or octyl) moieties (DAm increases by three to four orders of magnitude), is only observed during the extraction of Am and Eu from acidic media. In salt media the AAS effect is weakly observed, and is practically absent in such diluents as F-3 and FS-13. The extraction isotherm in the case of DPDO with an observed AAS effect indicates the distribution coefficients of Eu decrease by a factor of two to three, even at the concentration ratio of DPDO:Eu = 50:1; however, these values decrease only by 10% for the DPDO that do not indicate an observed AAS effect. It is proposed that the presence of water in the diluent is necessary for manifestation of the AAS effect. The synergistic effects of adding chlorinated cobalt dicarbollide (CCD) with the DPDO that has been reported for other systems was also found to prevail in several of the systems investigated in this study. On addition of CCD with the DPDO, a considerable synergistic effect is observed (DAm increases by three to four orders of magnitude) during Am and Eu extraction from nitrate media. In perchlorate media the synergistic effect is absent. The most probable reason for synergism in the presence of CCD is the higher hydrophobicity of the CCD anion as compared to the nitrate anion. The results of this work will be of utility in understanding existing and developing new extraction systems designed for the simultaneous removal of multiple radionuclides from acidic streams.","","","Idaho National Lab.

Cleanup of the site has been aided by various tools, including computer software used to predict contaminant migration in the future and estimate subsequent impacts. The System Assessment Capability (SAC) is a total systems tool designed to simulate the movement of contaminants from all waste sites at Hanford through the vadose zone, the unconfined aquifer, and the Columbia River. Except for iodine-129, most of the contaminants modeled by SAC have acceptably matched field measurements. The two most likely reasons for the inconsistency between the measured field data and SAC modeled predictions are an underestimated inventory and an overestimated sorption value (Kd). Field data tend to be point measurements taken from near the surface of the unconfined aquifer. Thus, the depth of the iodine-129 contamination plume on the site is not well characterized. Geostatistical analyses of the measured data were conducted to determine the mass of iodine-129 for four assumed plume depths within the unconfined aquifer. Several simulations for two different Kd's using the initial SAC inventory were run to determine the effect of an overestimated sorption value on SAC modeled predictions. The initial SAC inventory was then increased for the two different Kd's to determine the influence of an underestimated inventory on SAC modeled predictions. It was found that evidence for both an underestimated inventory and for an overestimated sorption value for iodine-129 exist. These results suggest that the Kd for iodine-129 should be reevaluated and that a more complete inventory must be generated in order to more accurately model iodine-129 groundwater contamination plumes that match available field data.","","","Pacific Northwest National Lab., Richland, WA (US), Environmental Molecular Sciences Laboratory (US)","US Department of Energy (US)","","United States","2004-12-15T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: Journal of Undergraduate Research; Journal Volume: IV; Other Information: PBD: 15 Dec 2004","","Medium: X; Size: page(s) 53-59","","PNNL-SA-39311","AC05-76RL01830","1941; 400403209; TRN: US0500880","","","2009-12-17T00:00:00Z","15011228","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/15011228","","Journal of Undergraduate Research","","IV"

Argon-hydrogen gas mixtures, with hydrogen additions up to 35% [1], have been successfully used as the shielding gas in gas tungsten arc welding (GTAW) of austenitic stainless steels. The addition of hydrogen improves weld pool wettability, bead shape control, surface cleanliness and heat input. The GTAW process is used extensively for welding various grades of stainless steel and is preferred when a very high weld quality is desired, such as that required for closure welding of nuclear materials packages. The use of argon-hydrogen gas mixtures for high-quality welding is occasionally questioned, primarily because of concern over the potential for HIC. This paper was written specifically to provide a technical basis for using an argon-hydrogen shielding gas in conjunction with the development, at the Savannah River Technology Center (SRTC), of an ''optimized'' closure welding process for the DOE standardized spent nuclear fuel canister [2]. However, the basis developed here can be applied to other applications in which the use of an argon-hydrogen shielding gas for GTAW welding of austenitic stainless steels is desired.","","","Fluor Hanford, Richland, WA (United States)","ENVIRONMENTAL MANAGEMENT (US)","","United States","2004-12-15T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: Welding Journal (Miami); Other Information: PBD: 15 Dec 2004","","Medium: ED; Size: page(s) 12","","HNF-23709, Rev.0","AC06-96RL13200","Journal ID: ISSN 0043-2296; WEJUA3; TRN: US0500077","","","2018-09-04T00:00:00Z","835536","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/835536","https://www.osti.gov/servlets/purl/835536","Welding Journal (Miami)","",""

Here, we test the hypothesis that these waste solutions alter and dissolve the native minerals present in the sediments and that colloidal (diameter &lt; 2 m) feldspathoids form. We reacted Hanford sediments with simulated solutions representative of Hanford waste tanks. The solutions consisted of 1.4 or 2.8 mol/kg NaOH, 0.125 or 0.25 mol/kg NaAlO4, and 3.7 mol/kg NaNO3 and were contacted with the sediments for a period of 25 or 40 days at 50 C. The colloidal size fraction was separated from the sediments and characterized in terms of mineralogy, morphology, chemical composition, and electrophoretic mobility. Upon reaction with tank waste solutions, native minerals released Si and other elements into the solution phase. This Si precipitated with the Al present in the waste solutions to form secondary minerals, identified as the feldspathoids cancrinite and sodalite. The solution phase was modeled with the chemical equilibrium model GMIN for solution speciation and saturation indices with respect to sodalite and cancrinite. The amount of colloidal material in the sediments increased upon reaction with waste solutions. At the natural pH found in Hanford sediments (pH 8) the newly formed minerals are negatively charged, similar to the unreacted colloidal material present in the sediments. The formation of colloidal material in Hanford sediments upon reaction with tank waste solutions is an important aspect to consider in the characterization of Hanford tank leaks and may affect the fate of hazardous radionuclides present in the tank waste.","","","Pacific Northwest National Laboratory (PNNL), Richland, WA (US), Environmental Molecular Sciences Laboratory (EMSL)","USDOE","","United States","2004-11-01T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: Environmental Science and Technology; Journal Volume: 38; Journal Issue: 21","","Medium: X","","PNNL-SA-43841","AC05-76RL01830","3600a; KP1301020; TRN: US0504752","10.1021/es0349709","","2009-12-17T00:00:00Z","15020742","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/15020742","","Environmental Science and Technology","21","38"

It would exploit the physical and safety characteristics of lead—chiefly, a high boiling point—as a coolant in place of water. Such a reactor could use fast neutrons and operate at high temperature, making it capable of burning many of the radioactive isotopes in the spent nuclear fuel produced by the nation's 103 light-water reactors.","","","Idaho National Lab.

The significantly enhanced fluorescence signal intensity and spectral resolution found at liquid helium temperature allowed, for the first time, direct fluorescence spectroscopic observation of the higher aqueous uranyl complexes with carbonate: UO2(CO3)22-, UO2(CO3)34- and (UO2)2(OH)3CO3-. The porewater samples were non-fluorescent at room temperature. However, at liquid helium temperature, both porewater samples displayed strong, well-resolved fluorescence spectra. Comparisons of the spectroscopic characteristics of the porewaters with those of the standard uranyl-carbonate complexes confirmed that U(VI) in the porewaters existed primarily as UO2(CO3)34-. A small amount of the dicalcium-urano-tricarbonate complex, Ca2UO2(CO3)3, was also observed that was consistent with thermodynamic calculation. The U(VI)-carbonate complex is apparently the mobile species responsible for the subsurface migration of U(VI), even though the majority of the in-ground U(VI) inventory at the site from which the samples were obtained exists as intragrain U(VI)-silicate precipitates.","","","Pacific Northwest National Lab.

The Spent Nuclear Fuel (SNF) Project, managed for DOE by prime contractor Fluor Hanford, removed more than 2,300 tons (2,100 metric tons [MT]) of irradiated uranium fuel--just over 4.65-million pounds--from a historic reactor area along the river's shore, called the ''Hanford Reach.'' The Project also dried the fuel and placed all of it in safe, dry, interim storage in central Hanford, nine miles from the Columbia and hundreds of feet above the groundwater table, effectively neutralizing the risks formerly posed by the decaying fuel. Removing the nearly 105,000 irradiated, solid metal uranium fuel assemblies--stored for decades underwater in the aging K Basins--marked a cornerstone event in Hanford's long farewell to arms. It was the third major triumph in a ''trifecta'' year at the old site, during which a Fluor Hanford-managed project completed stabilizing and safely packaging nearly 20 tons of plutonium-bearing materials, and another project finished pumping all liquids out of degrading, underground waste tanks. All three successful projects give traction to the vision and promise of DOE's Richland Operations Office (RL), to move wastes and special nuclear material away from the river and into Hanford's Central plateau.","","","Fluor Hanford, Richland, WA (United States)","ENVIRONMENTAL MANAGEMENT (US)","","United States","2004-10-06T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: Radwaste Solutions; Other Information: PBD: 6 Oct 2004","","Medium: ED; Size: page(s) 34","","HNF-22996, Rev.0","AC06-96RL13200","TRN: US0406715","","","2018-09-04T00:00:00Z","833518","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/833518","https://www.osti.gov/servlets/purl/833518","Radwaste Solutions","",""
"Geochemical and hydrodynamic controls on arsenic and trace metal cycling in a seasonally stratified US sub-tropical reservoir","Brandenberger, Jill M; Louchouarn, Patrick; Herbert, Bruce; Tissot, Philippe","11 NUCLEAR FUEL CYCLE AND FUEL MATERIALS; ARSENIC; DOMESTIC ANIMALS; GROUND WATER; HYDRODYNAMICS; MASS BALANCE; PARTICULATES; PONDS; PRECIPITATION; SEDIMENTS; SURFACE WATERS; URANIUM; URANIUM MINES; WATER QUALITY; WATERSHEDS; MINE TAILINGS; REDOX; GEOCHEMICAL CYCLING","The phase distribution of trace metals and oxyanions was investigated within a South Texas watershed hosting a high density of surface uranium mine pits and tailings. The objectives of the study were to evaluate the potential impact of these old uranium mining sites on the watershed with particular emphasis on spatial and temporal changes in water quality of a reservoir that serves as the major source of freshwater to a population of {approx} 350,000 people in the region. A livestock pond, bordered by uranium mine tailings, was used as a model case-study site to evaluate the cycling of uranium mine-derived oxyanions under changing redox conditions. Although the pond showed seasonal thermal and chemical stratification, geochemical cycling of metals was limited to Co and Pb, which seemed to be mostly associated with redox cycling of Mn mineral phases, and U, which suggested reductive precipitation in the ponds hypolimnion. Uranium levels, however, were too low to support strong inputs from th e tailings into the water column of the pond. The strong relations observed between particulate Cr, Cs, V and Fe suggest that these metals are associated with a stable particulate phase (probably allochthonous aluminosilicates) enriched in unreactive iron. This observation is supported by a parallel relationship in sediments collected across a broad range of sediment depositional processed (and histories) in the basin. Arsenic, though selectively enriched in the ponds water column, remained stable and mostly in solution throughout the depth of the profile and showed no sign of geochemical cycling or interaction with Fe-rich particles. We found no evidence of anthropogenic impacts of U mines beyond the purely local scale. Arsenic does decrease in concentration downstream of uranium mining sites but its presence within the Nueces drainage basin is related to interactions between surface and ground waters with uranium-rich geological formations rather than long-scale transport of contaminants downstream of the U mine pits and tailings. As in Lyssy pond, arsenic (and other oxyanions) in Lake Corpus Christi's water column are not affected by the abundant presence of Fe-rich particles but instead behave conservatively throughout the entire period of study. A quantitative mass balance model, constructed using monthly hydrological data for the reservoir, provides quantitative evidence of seasonal evaporative concentration of as in surface waters demonstrating the predominance of hydrodynamic constraints, over geochemical ones, on the cycling of this metal in selected aquatic systems.","","","Pacific Northwest National Lab., Richland, WA (US)","US Department of Energy (US)","","United States","2004-10-01T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: Applied Geochemistry; Journal Volume: 19; Journal Issue: 10; Other Information: PBD: 1 Oct 2004","","Medium: X; Size: page(s) 1601-1623","","PNWD-SA-6064","AC06-76RL01830","TRN: US0402813","10.1016/j.apgeochem.2004.02.006","","2016-05-26T00:00:00Z","15007946","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/15007946","","Applied Geochemistry","10","19"

The coating layers surrounding the fuel kernels in these spherical particles, consisting of pyrolytic carbon and silicon carbide layers, act as a pressure vessel that retains fission product gases. Many more fuel particles have failed in US irradiations than would be expected when only one-dimensional pressure vessel failures are considered. Post-irradiation examinations indicate that multi-dimensional effects may have contributed to these failures, such as (1) irradiation-induced shrinkage cracks in the inner pyrocarbon (IPyC) layer, (2) partial debonding between the IPyC and SiC layers, and (3) deviations from a perfectly spherical shape. An approach that was used previously to evaluate the effects of irradiation-induced shrinkage cracks is used herein to assess the effects of partial debonding and asphericity. Results of this investigation serve to identify circumstances where these mechanisms may contribute to particle failures.","","","Idaho National Lab.

"Nitrogen-16 Generation, Transport and Associated Shielding Requirements in the Supercritical-Water-Cooled Reactor","Buongiorno, Jacopo","11 - NUCLEAR FUEL CYCLE AND FUEL MATERIALS; COOLANTS; CROSS SECTIONS; EIGENVALUES; ELECTRIC POWER; FLOW RATE; FUEL ASSEMBLIES; HYDROGEN; ISOTOPES; NEUTRON FLUX; NITROGEN 16; POWER DENSITY; SHIELDING; STEAM LINES; TRANSPORT; TURBINES; WATER; WATER CHEMISTRY; coolant activation; nitroen 16; supercritical water cooled reactor; turbine shielding","As a water-cooled nuclear system with a direct thermal cycle, the supercritical-water-cooled reactor (SCWR) shares with the boiling water reactor (BWR) the issue of coolant activation and transport of the coolant activation products to the turbine and balance of plant (BOP). Consistent with the BWR experience, the dominant nuclide contributing to the SCWR coolant radioactivity at full power is 16N, which is produced by an (n,p) reaction on 16O. In this paper the production and decay of 16N in the SCWR coolant circuit along with the shielding requirements imposed on the BOP are analyzed and compared with those in a BWR with a similar thermal power rating. A simple control-mass approach is adopted in which the 16N inventory in a unit mass of coolant is tracked as the coolant flows in the SCWR and BWR primary systems, which are divided into several compartments (e.g., core, lower plenum, downcomer, etc.) of known volume, mass flow rate, and neutron flux. The values of the neutron flux and (n,p) cross section in the SCWR and BWR cores are calculated by means of full-length radially reflected Monte Carlo eigenvalue models of the SCWR and BWR fuel assemblies. The results are as follows: The 16N activities in the steam lines of the BWR with normal water chemistry, in the BWR with hydrogen water chemistry, and in the SCWR are about 40, 180, and 380 Ci/g, respectively. The calculated BWR values compare well with the trends and ranges found in the literature. The SCWR 16N concentration is significantly higher than that in the BWR for the following four reasons: 1. The coolant transit time in the SCWR core is about twice that in the BWR core. 2. The neutron flux is higher in the SCWR because of the higher power density. 3. The slow coolant pass in the water rods produces a significant 16N activity at the SCWR core inlet. 4. In the SCWR all the 16N generated in the core is sent to the steam lines because there is no recirculation within the vessel. A simple gamma attenuation model shows that the higher 16N activity in the SCWR results in shielding requirements only up to 10% higher than for the BWR with hydrogen water chemistry. However, because of the higher SCWR electric power, the specific shielding costs per unit of electric power associated with 16N are expected to be similar to or better than that for BWRs.","","","Idaho National Lab.

A mass transfer model is developed for a breached waste package to account for the entrainment of insoluble particles. In combination with radionuclide decay, soluble advection, and colloidal transport, a complete mass balance of nuclides in the waste package becomes available. The entrainment equations are derived from dimensionless parameters such as drag coefficient and Reynolds number and based on the assumption that insoluble particles are subjected to buoyant force, gravitational force, and drag force only. Particle size distributions are utilized to calculate entrainment concentration along with geochemistry model abstraction to calculate soluble concentration, and colloid model abstraction to calculate colloid concentration and radionuclide sorption. Results are compared with base case geochemistry model, which only considers soluble advection loss.","","INIS; OSTI as DE00837691","Yucca Mountain Project, Las Vegas, NV (United States)","US Department of Energy (US)","","United States","2004-07-26T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: Mass Transfer Model for a Breached Waste Package; Other Information: PBD: 26 Jul 2004","","Medium: ED; Size: 15 pages","","","","MOL.20040826.0536; DC42345; TRN: US0502979","","","2009-12-16T00:00:00Z","837691","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/837691","https://www.osti.gov/servlets/purl/837691","Mass Transfer Model for a Breached Waste Package","",""

The papers in this issue present the important results from a U.S. Department of Energy-sponsored Nuclear Engineering Research Initiative (NERI) project to study the efficacy of the thorium-uranium dioxide (ThO2-UO2) once-through fuel cycle in current light water reactors. The project addressed fuel cycle neutronics and economics; ThO2-UO2 fuel manufacturing; the in-pile thermal/mechanical behavior of ThO2-UO2 fuel during normal, off-normal, and accident conditions; and the long-term stability of ThO2-UO2 waste. Results from this work show that a small-scale separation of the uranium and thorium will enhance the fuel reactivity and achievable burnup from uranium-thorium dioxide fuels. Under conditions that meet the thermal requirements in present pressurized water reactors (PWRs), a properly designed microheterogeneous fuel will have more reactivity than all-uranium fuel, and the overall production of plutonium is significantly reduced. The use of thorium as a host for actinide fuels when PWRs are used for actinide transmutation was also explored. It was also determined that there were no fundamental obstacles to converting the current plants that manufacture uranium oxide-only fuel to a mixed ThO2-UO2 fuel. Also, the in-service and transient thermal and mechanical performance of homogeneous ThO2-UO2-based fuels with respect to safety is generally equal to or better than that of all-uranium fuel. Furthermore, a mixed thorium-uranium dioxide spent fuel appears to be a much more stable waste form than uranium oxide spent fuel.","","","Idaho National Lab.

In order to predict the performance of these barriers, mathematical models have been developed, verified and validated against analytical solutions, laboratory tests and field experiments within the international DECOVALEX III project. These models in general consider the full coupling of thermal (T), hydraulic (H) and mechanical (M) processes that would prevail in the geological media around the repository. For Bench Mark Test no. 1 (BMT1) of the DECOVALEX III project, seven multinational research teams studied the implications of coupled THM processes on the safety of a hypothetical nuclear waste repository at the near-field and are presented in three accompany papers in this issue. This paper is the first of the three companion papers, which provides the conceptualization and characterization of the BMT1 as well as some general conclusions based on the findings of the numerical studies. It also shows the process of building confidence in the mathematical models by calibration with a reference T-H-M experiment with realistic rock mass conditions and bentonite properties and measured outputs of thermal, hydraulic and mechanical variables.","","","Lawrence Berkeley National Lab.

He suggested that the decays of such activation products would interfere with the identification of fissionable materials. However, the combination of the energy spectrum and the temporal variation of the fission product gamma rays can be used to distinguish fissionable material from other nuclides. The activation of nuclides that could produce interferences will depend upon the specifics of the cargo and, possibly, the local surroundings. As discussed in our original publication, in addition to the steel that Prof. Alfassi referred to in his Comment, we studied the activation of wood, polyethylene, aluminum, and sandstone. Activation by thermal neutrons will always occur, and Prof. Alfassi correctly points out that nuclides such as {sup 49}Ca and {sup 37}S can be formed in this way. These nuclides are representative of most potential interferences. Both {sup 48}Ca and {sup 36}S have very low isotopic abundances (0.187% and 0.02%, respectively) and small thermal neutron capture cross sections (0.20 barns and 0.98 barns, respectively). In addition, their half lives are more than an order of magnitude longer than the gross average observed from the fission products, and more than two orders of magnitude longer than the lifetimes of the shorter-lived fission products that contribute significantly to the total intensity in the energy range of interest. These differences make it possible to distinguish between fission products and thermal neutron activation products. Prof. Alfassi also pointed out that interferences, of which {sup 16}N is likely to be the most important, can be produced by fast neutron reactions. (As described in our original publication, we did not use a 14 MeV generator in our work.) Fortunately, a judicious choice of the source neutron energy can limit the extent of these interferences quite significantly. For example, the laboratory threshold for the reaction {sup 16}O(n,p){sup 16}N is 10.2 MeV, while that for the reaction {sup 19}F(n,{alpha}){sup 16}N is 1.6 MeV. Thus a source neutron energy around 5 MeV would completely eliminate the {sup 16}O(n,p){sup 16}N reaction and limit the {sup 19}F(n,{alpha}){sup 16}N reaction to that portion of the cargo in which neutrons with energies greater than 1.6 MeV were present. However, even in the presence of {sup 16}N, the energy spectrum and temporal variation of the fission product gamma rays should be decisive in distinguishing fissionable material from these interferences.","","","Lawrence Berkeley National Lab.

The Pu, possibly as Pu(V) according to EELS measurements, was dispersed within re-precipitated uranium oxide (identified as U3O8) nano-crystals between U(VI) secondary phases and the CSNF surface. The U, Pu, and Am enrichment was observed in the corrosion products with tests on different nuclear fuels. This may have implications for the long-term behavior of CSNF under storage in a geologic waste repository.

Nominal coating thicknesses varied from 250 to 1500 mm. The effect of HVOF spray particle velocity on residual stress and deposition efficiency was assessed by preparing coatings at three different torch chamber pressures. The effect of substrate thickness on residual stress was determined by spraying coatings onto thick (6.4 mm) and thin (1.4 mm) substrates. Residual stresses were compressive for both coating materials and increased in magnitude with spray velocity. For coatings applied to thick substrates, near-surface residual stresses were essentially constant with increasing coating thickness. Difference in thermal expansion coefficient between low-carbon and stainless steels led to a 180 MPa difference in residual stress for Fe3A1 coatings. Deposition efficiency for both materials is maximized at an intermediate (~600 m/s) velocity. Considerations for X-ray measurement of residual stresses in HVOF coatings are also presented.","","","Idaho National Lab.

Varestraint testing, and various microstructural characterization techniques. Three different matrix compositions were chosen that were similar to commercial Ni-Cr-Mo base alloys (UNS N06455, N06022, and N06059). A ternary Ni-Cr-Gd alloy was also examined. The Gd level of each alloy was {approx}2 wt-%. All the alloys initiated solidification by formation of primary austenite and terminated solidification by a Liquid {gamma} + Ni{sub 5}Gd eutectic-type reaction at {approx}1270 C. The solidification temperature ranges of the alloys varied from {approx}100 to 130 C (depending on alloy composition). This is a substantial reduction compared to the solidification temperature range to Gd-enriched stainless steels (360 to 400 C) that terminate solidification by a peritectic reaction at {approx}1060 C. The higher-temperature eutectic reaction that occurs in the Ni-based alloys is accompanied by significant improvements in hot ductility and solidification cracking resistance. The results of this research demonstrate that Gd-enriched Ni-based alloys are excellent candidate materials for nuclear criticality control in spent nuclear fuel storage applications that require production and fabrication of large amounts of material through conventional ingot metallurgy and fusion welding techniques.","","","Sandia National Laboratories (SNL), Albuquerque, NM, and Livermore, CA (United States)","USDOE","","United States","2004-06-01T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: Proposed for publication in Welding Journal.","","Medium: X; Size: 15 p.","","SAND2004-2619J","AC04-94AL85000","TRN: US0902602","","","2009-12-16T00:00:00Z","952808","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/952808","","Proposed for publication in Welding Journal.","",""

After sorption equilibration, the suspensions were inoculated with a sulfate-reducing bacterium (SRB, Desulfovibrio desulfuricans G20). Inoculation of the suspensions containing sulfate-limited medium yielded significant SRB growth, along with concomitant reduction of sulfate and removal of U(VI) from solution. Inoculation of the suspensions containing lactate-limited medium yielded similar results while lactate was still present. Once the lactate was depleted, however, some of the U that had been removed from solution was re-solubilized in the hematite treatment and, to a lesser extent, in the goethite treatment. No re-solubilization was observed in the lactate-limited ferrihydrite treatment even after a prolonged incubation of four months. Analysis by U L3-edge XANES spectroscopy of mineral specimens sampled without inoculation yielded a typical U(VI) spectrum. Mineral specimens sampled at the end of the experiment yielded spectra similar to that of uraninite, thus providing strong evidence for SRB-promoted removal of U(VI) from solution by reductive precipitation of uraninite. Consequently, U re-solubilization was attributed to re-oxidation of the uraninite by Fe(III) present in the (hydr)oxide phases. Our results thus suggest that inoculation with SRB mediates reduction of soluble U(VI) to an insoluble U(IV) oxide so long as a suitable electron donor is available. Depletion of the electron donor may result in partial re-oxidation of the U(IV) to soluble U(VI) species when the surfaces of crystalline Fe(III) (hydr)oxides are incompletely reduced by reaction with SRB-generated sulfide.","","","Pacific Northwest National Lab.

The successful disposition of these actinides has an important impact on the strategy for developing advanced nuclear fuel cycles, weapons proliferation and the geologic disposal of high-level radioactive waste. During the last decade, there has been substantial interest in the use of the isometric pyrochlore structure-type, A,B,O, for the immobilization of actinides. Most of the interest has focused on titanate-pyrochlore because of its chemical durability; however, these compositions experience a radiation-induced transition from the crystalline-to-aperiodic state due to radiation damage from the alpha-decay of actinides. Depending on the actinide concentration, the titanate pyrochlore will become amorphous in less than 1,000 years of storage. Recently, systematic ion beam irradiations of a variety of pyrochlore compositions has revealed that zirconate pyrochlore does not become amorphous, but remains crystalline as a defect fluorite structure due to disordering of the A- and B-site cations. The zirconate pyrochlore will remain crystalline even to very high doses, greater than 100 displacements per atom. Systematic experimental studies of actinide-doped and ion beam-irradiated pyrochlore, studies of natural U-bearing pyrochlore, and simulations of the energetics of the disordering process now provide a rather detailed understanding of the structural and chemical controls of the pyrochlore structure on its response to radiation. These results provide a solid basis for predicting the behavior and durability of pyrochlore used to immobilize plutonium.","","","Pacific Northwest National Lab.

Biogeochemical cycling of iodine is complex, because iodine occurs in multiple oxidation states and as inorganic and organic species that may be hydrophilic, atmophilic, and biophilic. In this study, we focused on the sorption and transport behavior of iodine species (iodide, iodate, and 4-iodoaniline) in sediments collected at the Savannah River and Hanford Sites, where anthropogenic {sup 129}I from prior nuclear fuel processing activities poses an environmental risk. We conducted both column and batch experiments to investigate the sorption and transport behavior of iodine, and the sediments we examined exhibit a wide range in organic matter, clay mineralogy, soil pH, and texture. The results of our experiments illustrate complex behavior with various processes occurring, including iodate reduction, irreversible retention or mass loss of iodide, and rate-limited and nonlinear sorption. There was an appreciable iodate reduction to iodide, presumably mediated by the structural Fe(II) in some clay minerals; therefore, careful attention must be given to potential interconversion among species when interpreting the biogeochemical behavior of iodine in the environment. The different iodine species exhibited dramatically different sorption and transport behavior in three sediment samples collected from different depths at the Savannah River Site. This indicates that, when anthropogenic {sup 129}I is deposited on the surface at this site, the different iodine species will have different residence times as they migrate through the various sediment regimes.

We have applied synchrotron-based X-ray spectroscopic and diffraction techniques to characterize the speciation of uranium in samples of these contaminated sediments. U LIII-edge X-ray absorption fine structure (XAFS) spectroscopic studies demonstrate that uranium occurs predominantly as a uranium-(VI) silicate from the uranophane group of minerals. XAFS cannot distinguish between the members of this mineral group due to the near identical local coordination environments of uranium in these phases. However, these phases differ crystallographically, and can be distinguished using X-ray diffraction (XRD) methods. As the concentration of uranium was too low for conventional XRD to detect these phases, X-ray microdiffraction (?XRD) was used to collect diffraction patterns on {approx}20 ?m diameter areas of localized high uranium concentration found using microscanning X-ray fluorescence (?SXRF). Only sodium boltwoodite, Na(UO2)(SiO3OH)?1.5H2O, was observed; no other uranophane group minerals were present. Sodium boltwoodite formation has effectively sequestered uranium in these sediments under the current geochemical and hydrologic conditions. Attempts to remediate the uranium contamination will likely face significant difficulties because of the speciation and distribution of uranium in the sediments.","","","Pacific Northwest National Lab.

Managed by prime contractor Fluor Hanford, the new organization has made significant progress during its first six months. Under the direction of Mike Lackey, who recently joined Fluor from the Portland General Electric Trojan Plant, the Fluor Hanford D&amp;D organization is tackling the Plutonium Finishing Plant (PFP) complex and the Fast Flux Test Facility (FFTF), and is nearly finished demolishing the 233-S Plutonium Concentration Facility. In addition, the D&amp;D organization is progressing through the development and public comment phases of its required environmental permitting, planning work and procurement services to D&amp;D three other Hanford facilities: 224-T and 224-B Plutonium Concentration Facilities, and the U Plant radiochemical processing facility. It is also planning and beginning to D&amp;D the spent fuel handling areas of the Site's 100-K Reactor Area. The 586-square mile Hanford Site, the oldest plutonium production center in the world, served as the ''workhorse'' of the American nuclear defense arsenal from 1944 through 1989. Hanford produced the special nuclear material for the plutonium cores of the Trinity (test) and Nagasaki explosions, and then went on to produce more than half of the weapons plutonium ever manufactured by the United States, and about one-fourth of that manufactured worldwide. As a result, Hanford, the top-secret ''Paul Bunyan'' in the desert, is one of the most contaminated areas in the world. Its cleanup agreement with state and federal regulators, known as the ''Tri-Party Agreement,'' celebrates its 15th anniversary this spring, at a time when operations dealing with unstable plutonium leftovers, corroded spent fuel, and liquids wastes in single-shelled tanks conclude. As these crucial jobs are coming to an end, D&amp;D has gained traction as a central Site mission.","","","Fluor Hanford, Richland, WA (United States)","ENVIRONMENTAL MANAGEMENT (US)","","United States","2004-04-22T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: Decontamination, Decommissioning and Reutilization Division Newsletter; Other Information: PBD: 22 Apr 2004","","Medium: ED; Size: vp.","","HNF-20844, Rev.0","AC06-96RL13200","TRN: US0401975","","","2018-09-04T00:00:00Z","824122","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/824122","https://www.osti.gov/servlets/purl/824122","Decontamination, Decommissioning and Reutilization Division Newsletter","",""

On December 8, 1953, President Eisenhower, returning from his meeting with the leaders of Britain and France at the Bermuda Summit, flew directly to New York to address the United Nations General Assembly. His presentation, known afterwards as the ''Atoms for Peace'' speech, was bold, broad, and visionary. Eisenhower highlighted dangers associated with the further spread of nuclear weapons and the end of the thermonuclear monopoly, but the president also pointed to opportunities. Earlier that year, Stalin had died and the Korean War armistice was signed. Talks on reunification of Austria were about to begin. The speech sought East-West engagement and outlined a framework for reducing nuclear threats to security while enhancing the civilian benefits of nuclear technology. One specific proposal offered to place surplus military fissile material under the control of an ''international atomic energy agency'' to be used for peaceful purposes, especially economic development. Eisenhower clearly recognized the complex interrelationships between different nuclear technologies and the risks and the benefits that accrue from each. The widespread use of civilian nuclear technology and absence of any use of a nuclear weapon during the next half-century reflects success in his approach. Today, the world faces choices about nuclear technology that have their parallels in the Eisenhower calculus and its legacy. Although his specific fissile material proposal was never implemented, his broader themes gave impetus to agreements such as the nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty (NPT) and institutions such as the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA). The resulting governance process has promoted some and restricted other nuclear technology. Perhaps even more influential was Eisenhower's overarching recommendation that we try to reduce the risks and seek the benefits of nuclear technology. Whether seen as an effort to rebalance investment in a dual-use technology or as the foundation for a ''bargain'' between nuclear haves and have-nots, Eisenhower's speech brought together concepts that furnished the theoretical underpinnings of the nuclear technology control regime that has governed for nearly half a century. Some believe that Eisenhower's basic concepts remain sound and will provide the foundation for the future. Others believe they were never sound and promulgated dangerous dual-use technology around the world. Many are still debating exactly what Eisenhower meant to say.","","","Lawrence Livermore National Lab.

His view is that in order for new nuclear power plants to be considered, they must be economically competitive when compared to other baseload generation alternatives. With respect to capital cost, the industry has informally conveyed that overnight capital costs need to be below the range of $1,000-$1,200/kWE. Reactor vendors are working to reduce their first of a kind engineering costs to meet this capital cost threshold. Financing is then the next significant factor, which is complicated by whether the plant is being constructed in a regulated environment where the power company has the security of a regulated rate of return or as a merchant plant where the company assumes the risks and benefits of the proposed investment. With respect to operating and maintenance costs, the nuclear power industry has been dedicated to reducing costs while maintaining or improving safety. There are sound plans for spent fuel and high-level waste disposal, but there is a need to improve public confidence in transportation aspects. Regarding making new plants more attractive to investors, the risk factor has been a concern. The new Part 52 process is designed to help by requiring safety design issues to be identified and resolved prior to the issuance of the Combined Operating License (COL) process. While the revised process appears to be more acceptable from an investment risk perspective, there remains uncertainty in the fact that it has never been demonstrated. Skepticism, too, still exists with regard to building plants on schedule and within budget. Mr. Crane concludes that certain incentives will be needed for ''first movers'' in nuclear investment. These could include production tax credits, investment tax credits, government loan guarantees, and power purchase agreements. Despite the challenges facing new plant development, his view is that there is not a better time than now to consider new reactors. The first, most strategic way for the government to ensure new nuclear construction is to establish a national energy platform that recognizes the contribution of nuclear power. Actions are needed too in the reactor design and regulatory process. The best-suited technology is the advanced light water reactor designs. In particular, the Westinghouse AP1000 and the General Electric ESBSW look to be the most promising. Nuclear plants can also help comply with the Kyoto protocol. It is estimated that in 2002, the 103 nuclear units in the U.S. prevented 189.5 million metric tons of carbon, 2.28 million short tons of sulfur dioxide, and 1.39 million short tons of nitrogen oxides. Additional plants only serve to increase these amounts, but all energy sources must strive toward efficiencies to ensure diversification. Future staffing issues are also a critical element for new and existing plants. Not only are nuclear engineers essential, many other skill sets are required to operate and maintain facilities. It is important that we encourage young people to study math and science and it is important that they understand the wide variety of career opportunities available within the nuclear power industry. The interview ends with comments regarding Exelon's pursuit of an early site permit (ESP).","","","Exelon Nuclear (US)","none (US)","","United States","2004-03-01T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: Nuclear Plant Journal; Journal Volume: 22; Journal Issue: 2; Other Information: Mar-Apr 2004 issue; PBD: 1 Mar 2004","","Medium: X; Size: page(s) 37-39, 50 RANGE","","","","Journal ID: ISSN 0892-2055; TRN: US0402629","","","2009-12-16T00:00:00Z","825400","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/825400","","Nuclear Plant Journal","2","22"

This research was conducted in response to plant problems related to the accumulation of uranium with aluminosilicates in low-level radioactive waste evaporators. Conditions that favor precipitation of aluminosilicates also foster uranium solid precipitation, so it is difficult to attribute problems with uranium accumulation to, for example, only the formation of the aluminosilicates. Infrared spectra show that sodium uranates, uranium silicates, and other uranium solids are formed during the synthesis of sodium aluminosilicates structures in the presence of uranium. Both amorphous and sodalite aluminosilicate phases, unlike the zeolite A phase, show appreciable affinity for uranium incorporation during their formation in the presence of uranium.","","","","","","United States","2004-02-15T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: Nuclear Technology; Journal Volume: 145; Journal Issue: 2; Other Information: Copyright (c) 2006 American Nuclear Society (ANS), United States, All rights reserved. http://epubs.ans.org/; Country of input: International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA)","","Medium: X; Size: page(s) 215-229","","","","Journal ID: ISSN 0029-5450; NUTYBB; TRN: US06N0892011671","","","2010-06-03T00:00:00Z","20837833","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/20837833","","Nuclear Technology","2","145"

The final fuel form must have the desired properties, fuel density, fuel chemistry (X/U ratio), and impurity levels. These properties must be maintained throughout the entire fuel fabrication process and throughout the fuel operational lifetime. A variety of methods have been used during the past 40 years to obtain uranium nitride with applicable work performed on the (U, Pu)Nx system. These methods each have strengths and weaknesses with respect to the above criteria. Of the methods reviewed, the internal gelation process appears to be a viable method for well-controlled production of uranium nitride fuel for space nuclear reactors. It can be used to produce a uniform size microsphere that can in turn be used to produce high quality, low impurity UN fuel. This paper provides a summary review of many of the processes available for obtaining uranium nitride. The internal gelation process is described and limitations and advantages are discussed with respect to the fabrication of uranium nitride. Finally, recent results of uranium nitride fuel fabrication efforts using an internal gelation process are presented and discussed.","","","","","","United States","2004-02-04T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: AIP Conference Proceedings; Journal Volume: 699; Journal Issue: 1; Conference: STAIF 2004: 21. symposium on space nuclear power and propulsion: Human space exploration, space colonization, new frontiers and future concepts, Albuquerque, NM (United States), 8-11 Feb 2004; Other Information: DOI: 10.1063/1.1649601; (c) 2004 American Institute of Physics; Country of input: International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA)","","Medium: X; Size: page(s) 420-425","","","","Journal ID: ISSN 0094-243X; APCPCS; TRN: US04B3973075757","10.1063/1.1649601","","2012-06-28T00:00:00Z","20632864","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/20632864","","AIP Conference Proceedings","1","699"

Five key transfer processes have been considered and the characteristic time for each of these processes has been determined and compared with the residence time for the two-phase mixture in the flow channel. To complement the scaling analysis, an upward co-current two-phase flow model has been developed to predict the total mass flow rate and the steam venting velocity induced in the annular channel by the process of downward facing boiling. The model takes into account the wall heat flux level, the geometry of the flow channel, the local variation of the cross-sectional flow area, and the pressure drops through various segments of the channel. Based on the results of the flow calculations and the scaling analysis, criteria for experimental simulation have been established to assure that the phenomena simulated in laboratory-scale experiments would have the same effects as those anticipated for the fullscale system.","","","Idaho National Lab.

A screening system is described for detection of fissionable material hidden in maritime cargo containers. The system makes use of a low intensity neutron beam for producing fission; and the detection of the abundant high-energy {gamma} rays emitted in the {beta}-decay of short-lived fission products and {beta}-delayed neutrons. The abundance of the delayed {gamma} rays is almost an order of magnitude larger than that of the delayed neutrons normally used to detect fission and they are emitted on about the same time scale as the delayed neutrons, i.e., {approx}1 min. The energy and temporal distributions of the delayed {gamma} rays provide a unique signature of fission. Because of their high energy, these delayed {gamma} rays penetrate low-Z cargoes much more readily than the delayed neutrons. Coupled with their higher abundance, the signal from the delayed {gamma} rays escaping from the container is predicted to be as much as six decades more intense than the delayed neutron signal, depending upon the type and thickness of the intervening cargo. The {gamma} rays are detected in a large array of scintillators located along the sides of the container as it is moved through them. Measurements have confirmed the signal strength in somewhat idealized experiments and have also identified one interference when 14.5 MeV neutrons from the D, T reaction are used for the interrogation. The interference can be removed easily by the appropriate choice of the neutron source.","","","Lawrence Livermore National Lab.

"The Implications of a New ERa in Arms Control -- Perspectives and Analysis","Mladineo, Stephen V; Durbin, Karyn R; Indusi, Joseph P; Smoot, John L; Vannoni, Michael G; Satkowiak, Lawrence J","11 NUCLEAR FUEL CYCLE AND FUEL MATERIALS; ARMS CONTROL; IAEA; MANAGEMENT; MISSILES; NON-PROLIFERATION TREATY; NUCLEAR MATERIALS MANAGEMENT; PROLIFERATION; SECURITY; VERIFICATION; WEAPONS; Nuclear Materials Management; START; Strategic Offensive Reduction Treaty (SORT); Nuclear Arms Control","On November 13, 2003 the INMM hosted a workshop in Washington, DC entitled “The Implications of a New Era in Arms Control on Regional Nonproliferation and Nuclear Materials Management.” In this paper we summarize the workshop’s highlights and provide our analysis of the dominant themes. Ambassador Linton Brooks, Administrator of the National Nuclear Security Agency (NNSA), delivered the keynote address and focused on four points that are key to understanding the new era: • The demise of traditional East/West arms control; • The new strategic relationship between Russia and the United States; • The blurring of the distinction between nonproliferation and counter-terrorism; • The growing recognition that the nonproliferation regime is no longer adequate and needs to be strengthened. He issued a set of challenges to the workshop participants: if his premises were right, what should replace the lexicon of arms control? He described a four-part strategy for nuclear materials protection in Russia, and asked if that model should be replicated globally - potentially by leveraging the new relationship with Russia. Should it be through the IAEA, bilaterally, or some other mechanism? Asserting that the old Nonproliferation Treaty regime was inadequate, he asked what should replace it, and how do we bring it about? Three panel discussions were presented: • Implications of a New Era in US/Russia Arms Control Agreements • Implications of a New in Arms Control Upon Regional Nuclear Nonproliferation: South Asia/East Asia/Middle East • Nuclear Materials Management in a New Era of Arms Control In the first panel, Daryl Kimball, Executive Director of the Arms Control Association argued that arms control agreements provided predictability in the reduction of arms, and had been successful in advancing the methods of verification. Lucas Fischer, the Deputy Assistant Secretary for Arms Control at the US State Department acknowledged that INF and START provide a basis for verification and transparency. He defended the Treaty of Moscow, arguing that a related US-Russian joint declaration established working groups to focus on introducing transparency in offensive weapons and missile defense.","","","Pacific Northwest National Lab.

"Ecological risk assessment of radiological exposure to depleted uranium in soils at a weapons testing facility.","Hlohowskyj, I; Cheng, J; Tsao, C; Environmental Assessment","11 NUCLEAR FUEL CYCLE AND FUEL MATERIALS; DEPLETED URANIUM; DUSTS; FOOD; INGESTION; INHALATION; PLANTS; RADIOACTIVITY; RADIOISOTOPES; RISK ASSESSMENT; SOILS; TESTING; WEAPONS","The potential for unacceptable risks to biota from radiological exposure to depleted uranium (DU) in soils was evaluated at two sites where DU weapons testing had been conducted in the past. A screening risk assessment was conducted to determine if measured concentrations of DU-associated radionuclides in site soils exceed radionuclide levels considered protective of biota. While concentrations of individual radionuclides did not exceed acceptable levels, total radionuclide concentrations could result in potentially unacceptable doses to exposed biota. Thus, a receptor-specific assessment was conducted to estimate external and internal radiological doses to vegetation and wildlife known or expected to occur at the sites. Wildlife evaluated included herbivores, omnivores, and top-level predators. Internal dose estimates to wildlife considered exposure via fugitive dust inhalation and soil and food ingestion; root uptake was the primary exposure route evaluated for vegetation. Total doses were compared with acceptable dose levels of 1.0 and 0.1 rad/day for vegetation and wildlife, respectively, with potentially unacceptable risks indicated for doses exceeding these levels. All estimated doses were below or approximated acceptable levels, typically by an order of magnitude or more. These results indicate that current levels of DU in soils do not pose unacceptable radiological risks to biota at the sites evaluated.","","","Argonne National Lab.

The effect of the abnormal flows on the process has been studied for a PUREX flow sheet to find a way to manage their unfavorable effects on the process. As one of these activities, the algebraic equation expressing the concentration of the outflow by the operational conditions for a countercurrent solvent extraction system with the existence of abnormal flows was derived. This equation was the expanded form of the conventional Kremser's equation, which has been applied to the flow sheet under normal conditions. The preliminary study using the equation is also shown.","","","","","","United States","2003-12-15T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: Nuclear Technology; Journal Volume: 144; Journal Issue: 3; Other Information: Copyright (c) 2006 American Nuclear Society (ANS), United States, All rights reserved. http://epubs.ans.org/; Country of input: International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA)","","Medium: X; Size: page(s) 400-406","","","","Journal ID: ISSN 0029-5450; NUTYBB; TRN: US06N0875011658","","","2010-06-03T00:00:00Z","20837820","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/20837820","","Nuclear Technology","3","144"

In each of these locations the ARSA has measured varying air concentrations of 133Xe, and in most instances 131mXe and 135Xe, which are indicative of nuclear explosions. Anthropogenic radioxenon sources lead to high background levels of three of the four radioxenon isotopes of interest measured by the ARSA, making it difficult to sort ambient radioxenon emissions from clandestine underground nuclear explosions using concentrations alone. High concentrations and multiple isotope identification within a single sample are good measures of potentially suspect radioxenon emissions. Utilizing the ratios of the concentrations of 135Xe to 133Xe and 133Xe to 133mXe enables a distinction between routine emissions and clandestine underground nuclear detonations. Analyses to date indicate that concentration levels, multiple radioxenon isotopes in a single sample, the presence of 133mXe and isotopic ratios will all be good indicators of clandestine underground nuclear explosions and the combination of two or more of these measures will provide strong evidence of such activities. This paper will explore both the concentration data collected to date from each site and the usefulness of ratios in discriminating between reactor effluents and underground nuclear tests. The measured radioxenon concentrations represent an ambient background of some of the planned deployment locations outlined by the Provisional Technical Secretariat (PTS). These emissions can be attributed to nuclear power reactor operations, hospital use of 133Xe for medical testing, and fuel reprocessing activities to a lesser extent. In all instances the measured concentrations for 133Xe have been well above the 1 mBq/m3 minimum detectable concentration (MDC) requirement adopted by the Comprehensive Nuclear-Test-Ban-Treaty Organization Preparatory Commission. For several of the deployed locations (Florida, Charlottesville, Germany, and New York City) the ARSA, which has a 133Xe MDC below 0.2 mBq/m3, had a significant number of samples with 133Xe concentrations above the 0.2 mBq/m3 MDC level. Though no MDCâ€™s have been set for 131mXe and 133mXe the PTS required that any deployed system be capable of measuring them and the ARSA has achieved MDCâ€™s for the two metastable isotopes of less than 0.3 mBq/m3 and for 135Xe below 1.0 mBq/m3. The measured concentrations and the identification of multiple isotopes within a single sample at all of the sampling locations merited further analysis of the data to determine the isotopic ratios from non-nuclear detonation sources.","","","Pacific Northwest National Lab.

Technetium (99Tc) is an abundant fission product of particular concern in CWFs due to the high solubility and mobility of pertechnetate, TcO4-, the stable form of technetium in aerobic environments. CWFs can more effectively immobilize 99Tc if they contain additives that reduce mobile TcO4- to immobile Tc(IV) species. Leaching of 99Tc from reducing CWFs that contain Tc(IV) is much slower than for CWFs containing TcO4-. Previous X-ray absorption fine structure (XAFS) studies showed that the Tc(IV) species were oxidized to TcO4- in reducing grout samples prepared on a laboratory scale. Whether the oxidizer was atmospheric O2 or NO3- in the waste simulant was not determined. In actual CWFs, rapid oxidation of Tc(IV) by NO3- would be a concern, whereas oxidation by atmospheric O2 would be of less concern due to the slow diffusion and reaction of O2 with the reducing CWF. To address this uncertainty, two series of reducing grouts were prepared using TcO4- containing waste simulants with and without NO3-. In the first series of samples, the TcO4- was completely reduced using Na2S, and the samples were placed in containers that permitted O2 diffusion. In these samples, all of the technetium was initially present as aTc(IV) sulfide compound, TcSx, which was characterized using extended X-ray absorption fine structure (EXAFS) spectroscopy, and is likely Tc2S7. The TcSx initially present in the grout samples was steadily oxidized over 4 years. In the second series of samples, all of the TcO4- was not initially reduced, and the grout samples were placed in airtight containers. In these samples, the remaining TcO4- continued to be reduced as the samples aged, presumably due to the presence of reducing blast furnace slag. When samples in the second series were exposed to atmosphere, the lower-valent technetium species were rapidly oxidized to TcO4-.","","","Lawrence Berkeley National Lab.

However, as other methods, traditional MWD includes a milling step of the powders, which is a disadvantage from the operative and economical point of view. In this paper, the denitration process was studied by depressing the pressure inside the vessel where the solution is denitrated. Intermediate and final products were characterized. It was demonstrated that when working pressure ranges between 520 and 970 hPa during denitration, high density UO{sub 2} pellets can be obtained without resorting to a milling step.","","","","","","United States","2003-11-15T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: Nuclear Technology; Journal Volume: 144; Journal Issue: 2; Other Information: Copyright (c) 2006 American Nuclear Society (ANS), United States, All rights reserved. http://epubs.ans.org/; Country of input: International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA)","","Medium: X; Size: page(s) 252-258","","","","Journal ID: ISSN 0029-5450; NUTYBB; TRN: US06N0863011648","","","2010-06-03T00:00:00Z","20837810","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/20837810","","Nuclear Technology","2","144"

It was observed that the ratio of the intensities of molecular iodine ions I{sub 2}{sup +} and CsI{sup +} in the Knudsen cell-mass spectroscopic experiments can be used to investigate the iodine volatility in fuel under different conditions. The experiments show that the iodine volatility is similar in systems consisting of CsI alone, CsI/UO{sub 2}, and CsI/UO{sub 2}/MoO{sub x} (with molybdenum in oxidation states 0, 2, and 4). The iodine volatility is much higher, however, in CsI/UO{sub 2}/MoO{sub 3} systems (with molybdenum in oxidation state = 6). The iodine volatility in the fuel increases significantly if oxidation of the molybdenum goes to the MoO{sub 3} stage. The increase in the iodine volatility is caused by the formation of elemental iodine from cesium iodide. It is concluded from these measurements that the oxidation of the fuel to the UO{sub 2.2} will substantially increase the volatilization of fission product iodine. An analysis of the literature data suggests that the enhanced iodine volatilization process may be initiated when the fuel is oxidized to UO{sub 2.02}.","","","","","","United States","2003-11-15T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: Nuclear Technology; Journal Volume: 144; Journal Issue: 2; Other Information: Copyright (c) 2006 American Nuclear Society (ANS), United States, All rights reserved. http://epubs.ans.org/; Country of input: International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA)","","Medium: X; Size: page(s) 259-273","","","","Journal ID: ISSN 0029-5450; NUTYBB; TRN: US06N0864011649","","","2010-06-03T00:00:00Z","20837811","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/20837811","","Nuclear Technology","2","144"

Packaging into MCO's will assist in the safe and economic disposition of SNF and greatly reduce risk to the environment. Packaged fuel will be removed from close proximity to the Columbia River to a more suitable area of the site where it will be stored on an interim basis. Eventually, the fuel will be transferred to the federal geologic repository for long-term storage. One of the key elements in the SNF process is final closure of the MCO by welding. Fuel is loaded into the MCO (approximately 2 ft. in diameter and 13 ft. long) and a heavy shield plug inserted into the top, creating a mechanical seal. The plug contains several process ports for various operations, including vacuum drying and inert-gas backfilling of the packaged fuel. When fully processed, the Canister Cover Assembly (CCA) is placed over the shield plug and final closure made by welding. The following describes the effort to develop and qualify the root-pass technique associated with the MCO final closure weld.","","","FFS (US)","ENVIRONMENTAL MANAGEMENT (US)","","United States","2003-09-15T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: Welding Journal; Other Information: PBD: 15 Sep 2003","","Medium: ED; Size: page(s) 15","","HNF-17866-FP, Rev.0","AC06-96RL13200","TRN: US0304978","","","2018-09-04T00:00:00Z","816309","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/816309","https://www.osti.gov/servlets/purl/816309","Welding Journal","",""

The Act was born out of the government of Canada's response to the Seaborn Panel review of AECL's disposal concept for nuclear fuel waste. The legislation compels nuclear waste producers to act, and it challenges Canadians to become engaged. The NWMO has been given until November 15, 2005 to conduct a study and to recommend to the government an approach for the long-term management of Canada's used nuclear fuel. At a minimum, the Act requires study of three approaches: deep geological disposal; storage at the nuclear reactor sites; centralized storage, either above or below ground. The article, which is an excerpt from a technical paper presented at the 24th Annual Conference of the Canadian Nuclear Society in Toronto, Ontario, 8-11 June 2003, discusses the approach to be taken to achieve the objectives, involve the public, and meet the deadlines imposed.","","","Nuclear Waste Management Organization, Toronto, Ontario (CA)","none (US)","","United States","2003-09-01T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: Nuclear Plant Journal; Journal Volume: 21; Journal Issue: 5; Other Information: PBD: 1 Sep 2003","","Medium: X; Size: page(s) 46-48","","","","Journal ID: ISSN 0892-2055; TRN: US0400589","","","2009-12-16T00:00:00Z","821054","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/821054","","Nuclear Plant Journal","5","21"

"Influence of calcium carbonate on U(VI) sorption to soils","Zheng, Zuoping; Tokunaga, Tetsu K; Wan, Jiamin","54 ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCES; 58 GEOSCIENCES; 11 NUCLEAR FUEL CYCLE AND FUEL MATERIALS; U(VI) sorption Soil Modeling","Uranium contamination of the subsurface resulting from pastradioactive waste disposal and storage practices represents a seriousenvironmental contamination problem at a number of sites. Under oxidizinggeochemical conditions, the mobility of U(VI) in subsurface is primarilycontrolled by sorption. In many soil systems, calcite represents animportant mineral phase which likely affects U(VI) sorption behavior. Toquantify this influence, sorption of U(VI) to soils in the presence ofnaturally occurring calcium carbonate was investigated by conductingbatch experiments in which either U(VI) concentration or solution pH wasvaried. Two soils containing different calcite concentrations wereselected, one from Oak Ridge, Tennessee, and another from Altamont Pass,California. The results show that the presence of calcium carbonate insoils strongly affects U(VI) sorption. Higher concentrations of soilcalcium carbonate lead to a pronounced suppression of the pH-dependentsorption curve in neutral pH range, because of the formation of a verystable neutral complex of calcium uranyl carbonate (Ca2UO2(CO3)3) insolution. A surface complexation model considering both strong and weaksites for ferrihydrite and ionizable hydroxyl sites for clay minerals wascompared with experimental results, and U(VI) binding parameters werereasonably estimated. Fair agreement was found between the modelpredictions and sorption data, which span a wide range of U(VI)concentrations and pH. The results also show that selection ofappropriate solution-to-solid ratios is important when measuringdistribution coefficients in calcareous soils because the impact ofcalcium carbonate on U(VI) sorption in natural systems can beartificially diminished by dilution.","","","Lawrence Berkeley National Lab.

The application selected to demonstrate this framework involves steady state groundwater flow at the U.S. Department of Energy Savannah River Site General Separations Area, modeled using the Subsurface Flow And Contaminant Transport (FACT) code. Input parameter uncertainty, based initially on expert opinion, was found to decrease in all variables of the posterior distribution.

The isotopic dilution tests were accomplished by adding an alkaline depleted uranium solution to small portions of simulated and actual storage tank waste solutions with enriched U-235 compositions. Based on the laboratory observations, recommendations were made, which involved the addition of significant quantities of uranyl carbonate solution to over four million liters of U-235 enriched waste stored in Tank 43H at SRS to reduce the risk for criticality. A post-uranyl carbonate addition analysis on the tank supernate confirmed the effectiveness of depleted uranium in isotopic dilution of U-235. The U-235 enrichment in the Tank 43H was isotopically diluted from an original high of over 4 wt percent down to less than 0.5 wt percent as predicted from the laboratory investigations.","","","Savannah River Site (SRS), Aiken, SC (United States)","US Department of Energy (US)","","United States","2003-06-27T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: American Nuclear Society; Other Information: PBD: 27 Jun 2003","","Medium: ED; Size: vp.","","WSRC-MS-2003-00360","AC09-96SR18500","TRN: US0303320","","","2018-09-04T00:00:00Z","812131","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/812131","https://www.osti.gov/servlets/purl/812131","American Nuclear Society","",""
"Characterization of Microbial Activities and U Reduction in a Shallow Aquifer Contaminated by Uranium Mill Tailing","Elias, Dwayne A; Krumholz, Lee R; Wong, D; Long, Philip E; Suflita, Joseph M","11 NUCLEAR FUEL CYCLE AND FUEL MATERIALS","A Characterization of the Shiprock, NM, uranium mill tailing site focused on the geochemical and microbiological factors governing in-situ uranium-redox reactions. Groundwater and aqueous extracts of sediment samples contained a wide concentration range of sulfate, nitrate, and U(VI) with median values of 21.2 mM, 16.1um, and 2.7 um, respectively. Iron (III) was not detected in groundwater, but a median value of 0.3 mM in sediment extracts was measured. Bacterial diversity down gradient from the disposal pile reflected the predominant geochemistry with relatively high numbers of sulfate-and nitrate-reducing microorganisms, and smaller numbers of acetogenic, methanogenic, nitrate-dependent Fe(II)-oxidizing, Fe(III)-reducing, and sulfide oxidizing bacteria. In aquifer slurry incubations, nitrate reduction was always preferred and had a negative impact on sulfate-, Fe(III)-, and U-reduction rates. We also found that sulfate-reduction rates decreased sharply in the presence of clay, while Fe(III)-reduction increased with no clear impact on U reduction. In the absence of clay, iron and sulfate reduction correlated with concentrations of Fe(III) and sulfate, respectively. Rates of U(VI) loss did not correlate with the concentration of any electron acceptor. With the exception of Fe(III), electron donor amendment was largely unsuccessful in stimulating electron acceptor loss over a 1-week incubation period, suggesting that endogenous forms of organic matter were sufficient to support microbial activity. Our findings suggest that efforts to accelerate biological U reduction should initially focus on stimulating nitrate removal.","","","Pacific Northwest National Lab.

This nuclear material was a homogeneous mixture of plutonium oxide and aluminum metal that had been compounded for use as the core matrix in Mark 42 nuclear fuel. Because this material had later failed plutonium distribution specifications, it was rejected for use in the fabrication of Mark 42 fuel tubes, and was stored at the Savannah River Site (SRS) awaiting disposition. This powder-like material was composed of a mixture of approximately 80 percent aluminum and 11 percent plutonium. Historically, aluminum-clad spent nuclear fuels [13] have been dissolved using a mercuric nitrate catalyst in a nitric acid (HNO3) solution to facilitate the dissolution of the bulk aluminum cladding. Developmental work at SRS indicated that the plutonium oxide/aluminum compounded matrix could be dissolved without mercury. Various mercury-free conditions were studied to evaluate the rate of dissolution of the Mark 42 compact material and to assess the corrosion rate to the stainless steel dissolver. The elimination of mercury from the dissolution process fit with waste minimization and industrial hygiene goals to reduce the use of mercury in the United States. The mercury-free dissolution technology was optimized for Mark 42 compact material in laboratory-scale tests, and successfully implemented at the plant.","","","Savannah River Site (SRS), Aiken, SC (United States)","US Department of Energy (US)","","United States","2003-05-14T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: Nucleonika International Journal of Nuclear Research; Other Information: PBD: 14 May 2003","","Medium: ED; Size: vp.","","WSRC-MS-2003-00254","AC09-96SR18500","TRN: US0302869","","","2018-09-04T00:00:00Z","810991","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/810991","https://www.osti.gov/servlets/purl/810991","Nucleonika International Journal of Nuclear Research","",""

Recent descriptions of Ca-UO2-CO3 complexes indicate that these species may dominate the aqueous speciation of U(VI) in many environments. We monitored the bacterial reduction of U(VI) in bicarbonate-buffered solution in the presence and absence of Ca. XAFS measurements confirmed the presence of a Ca-U(VI)-CO3 complex in the initial solutions containing calcium. Calcium, at millimolar concentrations (0.45-5 mM), caused a significant decrease in the rate and extent of bacterial U(VI) reduction. Both facultative (Shewanella putrefaciens strain CN32) and obligate (Desulfovibrio desulfuricans, Geobacter sulfurreducens) anaerobic bacteria were affected by the presence of calcium. Reduction of U(VI) ceased when the calculated system Eh re ached -0.046+/- 0.001 V, based on the Ca2UO2(CO3)(3) --&gt; UO2,cr couple. The results are consistent with the hypothesis that U is a less energetically favorable electron acceptor when the Ca-UO2-CO3 complexes are present. The results do not support Ca inhibition caused by direct interactions with the cells or with the electron donor as the reduction of fumarate or Tc(VII)O-4(-) under identical conditions was unaffected by the presence of Ca.","","","Pacific Northwest National Lab.

The 87Sr/86Sr values of the pore waters decrease systematically with depth, from a high value of 0.721 near the surface toward the bulk sediment average value of 0.711. Estimates of the bulk weathering rate combined with Sr isotopic data were used to constrain the long-term (century to millenial scale) natural diffuse infiltration flux for the site given both steady state and nonsteady state conditions. The models suggest that the infiltration fluc for the site is 7+- 3 mm/yr.

Stimulated microbial populations removed U almost entirely from solution within 1 month. X-ray absorption near-edge structure analysis showed that U(VI) was reduced to U(IV) during the incubation. Observations by transmission electron microscopy, selected area diffraction pattern analysis, and energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopic analysis showed two distinct types of prokaryotic cells that precipitated only a U(IV) mineral uraninite (UO{sub 2}) or both uraninite and metal sulfides. Prokaryotic cells associated with uraninite and metal sulfides were inferred to be sulfate-reducing bacteria. Phylogenetic analysis of 16S ribosomal DNA obtained from the original and incubated sediments revealed that microbial populations were changed from microaerophilic Proteobacteria to anaerobic low-G+C gram-positive sporeforming bacteria by the incubation. Forty-two out of 94 clones from the incubated sediment were related to sulfate-reducing Desulfosporosinus spp., and 23 were related to fermentative Clostridium spp. The results suggest that, if in situ bioremediation were attempted in the uranium mine ponds, Desulfosporosinus spp. would be a major contributor to U(VI) and sulfate reduction and Clostridium spp. to U(VI) reduction.","","","Argonne National Lab.

Fluid saturation measurements were obtained with a dual-energy gamma radiation system. The experimental conditions reflected those at the Hanford Site in Washington State, where an estimated 363-580 m3 of carbon tetrachloride was disposed to the subsurface. A key subsurface feature at the Hanford Site is a sloped Plio-Pleistocene caliche layer, which was reproduced in the experiment as a sloped lens in a medium-grained, uniform, sand matrix. The caliche contains considerable amounts of calcium carbonate and may have fluid wettability properties other than strongly water wet. A total of 800 ml of carbon tetrachloride was injected in the experimental domain at a rate of 0.5 ml min-1 from a small source area located at the surface. After apparent steady-state conditions were obtained with respect to carbon tetrachloride redistribution (i.e., the formation of residual DNAPL), saturation measurements indicate that all of the DNAPL that initially moved into the caliche, remained in this layer. This experimental result could not be reproduced with numerical multifluid flow simulations based on conventional constitutive relations between relative permeability, saturation, and fluid pressures. Water was subsequently applied to the surface at a constant rate over the full length of the caliche layer to study carbon tetrachloride displacement as a result of changing water saturations. Results show that as a result of this action, 29% of the DNAPL was removed from the caliche. However, the majority of the fluid remained in the caliche entrapped by water. Simulations with the multifluid flow simulator show that the current constitutive theory for relative permeability, saturation and capillary pressure does not describe displacement physics properly.","","","Pacific Northwest National Lab., Richland, WA (US)","US Department of Energy (US)","","United States","2003-02-25T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: Vadose Zone Journal; Journal Volume: 2; Journal Issue: 1; Other Information: PBD: 25 Feb 2003","","Medium: X; Size: page(s) 25-33","","PNNL-SA-36288","AC06-76RL01830","TRN: US0407444","","","2009-12-17T00:00:00Z","15003505","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/15003505","","Vadose Zone Journal","1","2"

As part of this study, a series of DU penetrators were fired at an Abrams tank and a Bradley fighting vehicle, and the aerosols generated by vehicle perforation were collected and characterized. A robust sampling system was designed to collect aerosols in this difficult environment and to monitor continuously the sampler flow rates. Interior aerosols collected were analyzed for uranium concentration and particle size distribution as a function of time. They were also analyzed for uranium oxide phases, particle morphology, and dissolution in vitro. These data will provide input for future prospective and retrospective dose and health risk assessments of inhaled or ingested DU aerosols.

This also defines an important environmental problem because of its bearing on the transport and sequestration of uranyl released from nuclear facilities and uranium mining operations. Calcite is a nearly ubiquitous mineral in soils and groundwater aquifers. X-ray absorption spectroscopy and X-ray fluorescence microprobe studies of uranium in relatively U-rich {approx}13700-year-old calcite from a speleothem in northernmost Italy indicate substitution of uranyl for a calcium and two adjacent carbonate ions in calcite.

This function showed the burnup effect on the reactivity as a function of the fuel position; an explicit expression of this function was derived by considering a change in reactivity with respect to a slight variation in fuel burnup. The burnup importance function was applied to the Phase IIA benchmark model that was adopted by the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development/Nuclear Energy Agency Expert Group on Burnup Credit Criticality Safety. The function clearly displayed that burnup importance of the end regions increased (a) as burnup, (b) as cooling time, (c) in consideration of burnup profile, and (d) in consideration of fission products.

Simulated assays of 23 different fuel assemblies with a broad range of total fissile mass content (1.3 to 8.3 wt%) and fissile isotopic ratios are performed and analyzed using two different methods: a linear system model using a least-squares regression analysis and a radial basis neural network. Mean errors using the linear system model for the 23 different fuel types were approximately 20% for 233U and 43% for total plutonium.

Previous investigations of the bacterial reduction of U(VI) in the presence of goethite (a-FeOOH) found that, in spite of potential competition as an electron acceptor, goethite had little impact on the bacterial reduction of U(VI) to insoluble U(IV). Mn(III/IV) oxides are also electron acceptors for DMRB but are stronger oxidants than Fe(III) oxides. Differences in the solubility of oxidized Mn and U challenges predictions of their biogeochemical behavior during redox cycling. The potential for Mn oxides to modify the biogeochemical behavior of U during reduction by a subsurface bacterium Shewanella putrefaciens CN32 was investigated using synthetic Mn(III/IV) oxides [pyrolusite ({beta}-MnO{sub 2}), bixbyite (Mn{sub 2}O{sub 3}) and K{sup +}-birnessite (K{sub 4}Mn{sub 14}O{sub 27} {center_dot} 8H{sub 2}O)]. In the absence of bacteria, pyrolusite and bixbyite oxidized biogenic uraninite (UO{sub 2}(s)) to soluble U(VI) species, with bixbyite being the most rapid oxidant. The Mn(III/IV) oxides lowered the bioreduction rate of U(VI) relative to rates in their absence, or in the presence of gibbsite [Al(OH){sub 3}] added as a non-redox reactive surface. Evolved Mn(II) increased with increasing initial U(VI) concentration in the biotic experiments, indicating that valence cycling of U facilitated the reduction of Mn(III/IV). Despite an excess of the Mn oxide, 43-100% of the initial U was bioreduced after extended incubation. Analysis of thin sections of bacterial-Mn oxide suspensions revealed that the reduced U resided in the periplasmic space of the bacterial cells. In the absence of Mn(III/IV) oxides, UO{sub 2}(s) accumulated as copius fine-grained particles external to the cell. These results indicate that the presence of Mn(III/IV) oxides may impede the biological reduction of U(VI) in subsoils and sediments?.","","","Pacific Northwest National Lab.

The obtained values partly depend on the LiF/AlF{sub 3} ratio and can reach more than 30 000 when AlF{sub 3} is in excess with regard to the formation of the cryolite (Li{sub 3} AlF{sub 6}). Furthermore, in the metal phase, the aluminum interacts with the lanthanides to a lesser extent than in other usual metallic solvents. This opens a new way to explore the feasibility of the separation of actinides and lanthanides in the field of nuclear fuel reprocessing.","","","","","","United States","2002-08-15T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: Nuclear Technology; Journal Volume: 139; Journal Issue: 2; Other Information: Copyright (c) 2006 American Nuclear Society (ANS), United States, All rights reserved. http://epubs.ans.org/; Country of input: International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA)","","Medium: X; Size: page(s) 167-174","","","","Journal ID: ISSN 0029-5450; NUTYBB; TRN: US06N0732002209","","","2010-06-03T00:00:00Z","20826780","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/20826780","","Nuclear Technology","2","139"

These ZrFe{sub 2}-type intermetallics incorporate and immobilize highly radioactive and long-lived constituents that are present in waste forms based on the stainless steel-zirconium (SS-Zr) alloys. This paper reviews the metallurgy of SS-Zr alloys with emphasis on Laves intermetallic behavior. Microscopy and diffraction studies have shown that all actinide elements and most fission product elements are present only in the ZrFe2-type intermetallics of a stainless steel-15 wt.% zirconium (SS-15Zr) waste form, whereas only molybdenum is incorporated in the ZrFe{sub 2}-type intermetallics of a zirconium-8 wt.% stainless steel (Zr-8SS) alloy. Because of the importance of material durability to waste disposal, recent experiments have been aimed at determining the corrosion behavior of these intermetallics. Results from transmission electron microscopy of corrosion layers observed on the ZrFe{sub 2}-type compounds are presented.","","","Argonne National Lab.

The properties include the radiotoxicity, decay heat, activity, and actinide content embedded in various spent fuels or high-level wastes, which could be measures of the effectiveness of waste management. From radiotoxicity analysis of fuel cycles, the toxicity of the DUPIC option based on 1 GW(electric).yr is much smaller than those of other fuel cycle options such as the PWR once-through mode, mixed oxide fuel recycling mode, and CANDU once-through mode. The analysis shows that the value is just about half the order of magnitude of other fuel cycles until decayed to a level below the toxicity of initial ore. This means that the DUPIC option could have an indirect benefit on the environmental effects of long-term spent-fuel disposal. From total activity analysis of various fuel cycle options, the activity per metric ton heavy metal of spent fuel is the lowest in natural uranium CANDU fuel, but in the case of activity based on 1 GW(electric).yr, the DUPIC option has the smallest activity. In the meanwhile, from the activity analysis of {sup 99}Tc and {sup 237}Np, which are important to the long-term transport in geologic media, the DUPIC option was being contained in only about half of those other options. In conclusion, compared to other fuel cycle cases, the irradiated DUPIC fuels would have good properties from the perspective of environmental effects.","","","","","","United States","2002-05-15T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: Nuclear Technology; Journal Volume: 138; Journal Issue: 2; Other Information: Copyright (c) 2006 American Nuclear Society (ANS), United States, All rights reserved. http://epubs.ans.org/; Country of input: International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA)","","Medium: X; Size: page(s) 123-139","","","","Journal ID: ISSN 0029-5450; NUTYBB; TRN: US06N0705002182","","","2010-06-03T00:00:00Z","20826753","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/20826753","","Nuclear Technology","2","138"

These systems consisted of an in situ treatment cell located in an area of higher hydraulic head and a siphon connecting the cell to a surface stream at a lower hydraulic head. The siphon induced contaminated ground water flow through a permeable treatment media in the cells and transported the treated water to the discharge points in a surface stream. The hydraulic head available to drive the systems is divided between the head losses associated with the treatment cell and siphon. Six different treatment cell configurations and seven different siphon configurations have been hydraulically evaluated in association with both pilot-scale systems.

Initial neutronic and fuel behavior calculations for several ThO{sub 2}-UO{sub 2} mixtures being considered for use in commercial nuclear power plants are described.The Monte Carlo N-Particle -Origen2 Coupled Utility Program (MOCUP) was used to analyze the reactivity characteristics and isotopic concentrations of unit fuel pins/cells and lattice/assembly models as a function of burnup and reactivity. Neutronic results for a three-batch 6-yr cycle for each of three proposed ThO{sub 2}-UO{sub 2} mixtures with the UO{sub 2} enriched to 19.5% {sup 235}U are presented. Neutronic results show that fuels fabricated from ThO{sub 2}-UO{sub 2} mixtures can reach an average discharge burnup of up to 70 MWd/kgHM, which will increase the time between refueling and decrease the production of weapons-grade plutonium by a factor of 3 as compared to all-urania fuel.A version of FRAPCON-3, modified to handle pure thoria and ThO{sub 2}-UO{sub 2} mixtures, was used for the fuel performance and behavior calculations. The new version called FRAPCON-3Th includes the updated material property models for thermal conductivity, specific heat capacity, emissivity, thermal expansion, modulus of elasticity, and melting temperature to predict fuel behavior for pure ThO{sub 2} or ThO{sub 2}/UO{sub 2} mixed fuel. For a concentration of 75% ThO{sub 2}/25% UO{sub 2}, initial fuel performance parameters (peak centerline temperature, gap conductance, thermal expansion, etc.) predicted operating conditions are better than those of current UO{sub 2} fuel. A ThO{sub 2}-ThO{sub 2}/UO{sub 2} thermal conductivity model is still in the development stage. For all fuel calculations, an interim model that interpolates between the Belle and Berman predicted thermal conductivity using a correction factor for radiant heat transport and the MATPRO-predicted thermal conductivity for UO{sub 2} was applied.","","","","","","United States","2002-02-15T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: Nuclear Technology; Journal Volume: 137; Journal Issue: 2; Other Information: Copyright (c) 2006 American Nuclear Society (ANS), United States, All rights reserved. http://epubs.ans.org/; Country of input: International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA)","","Medium: X; Size: page(s) 97-110","","","","Journal ID: ISSN 0029-5450; NUTYBB; TRN: US06N0681002158","","","2010-06-03T00:00:00Z","20826729","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/20826729","","Nuclear Technology","2","137"

An increase in {sup 238}Pu is known to increase the heat load in pure plutonium metal. At high {sup 238}Pu concentrations in spent fuel, the heat load in the plutonium may be sufficiently high that it will be less desirable for weapons production. An actinide-based fuel is proposed that will increase the ratio of {sup 238}Pu/{sup 239}Pu in spent fuel, leading to a fuel form resistant to diversion for weapons use. Two actinides were considered, {sup 237}Np and {sup 241}Am, for seeding in low-enriched (3% {sup 235}U) uranium oxide fuel. The ORIGEN point depletion code was utilized to calculate time-dependent spent-fuel concentrations of {sup 238}Pu, {sup 239}Pu, {sup 237}Np, {sup 241}Am, and other nuclides of interest. The preliminary results show that both {sup 237}Np and {sup 241}Am in small quantities generate significant {sup 238}Pu in spent fuel, and more importantly, both actinide-based fuels shift the {sup 238}Pu/{sup 239}Pu ratio significantly higher at relatively small initial concentrations. Based on a closed-loop actinide-fuel life cycle study, a {sup 237}Np-based fuel cycle seems much more sustainable as compared to {sup 241}Am. However, {sup 241}Am addition to {sup 237}Np-based fuel may have benefits in reducing the end-of-cycle deficit of {sup 237}Np.","","","","","","United States","2002-01-15T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: Nuclear Technology; Journal Volume: 137; Journal Issue: 1; Other Information: Copyright (c) 2006 American Nuclear Society (ANS), United States, All rights reserved. http://epubs.ans.org/; Country of input: International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA)","","Medium: X; Size: page(s) 1-9","","","","Journal ID: ISSN 0029-5450; NUTYBB; TRN: US06N0674002151","","","2010-06-03T00:00:00Z","20826722","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/20826722","","Nuclear Technology","1","137"
